  INTRODUCTION
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Rev. Jean Pierre de Caussade was one of the most remarkable
   spiritual writers of the Society of Jesus in France in the 18th
   Century. His death took place at Toulouse in 1751. His works have gone
   through many editions and have been republished, and translated into
   several foreign languages.

   The present book gives an English translation of the tenth French
   Edition of Fr. de Caussade's "Abandon à la Providence Divine," edited,
   to the great benefit of many souls, by Fr. H. Ramière, S. J.

   A portion of this remarkable work in English has already appeared in
   America, but many readers, to whom this precious little book has become
   a favourite, will welcome a complete translation, especially as what
   has already appeared in the English version may be considered as merely
   the theoretical part, whilst the "Letters of Direction" which form the
   greater portion of the present work give the practical part. They
   answer objections, solve difficulties, and give practical advice. The
   book thus gains considerably in value and utility.

   It is divided into two unequal parts, the first containing a treatise
   on total abandonment to Divine Providence, and the second, letters of
   direction for persons leading a spiritual life.

   The "Treatise" comprises two different aspects of Abandonment to Divine
   Providence; one as a virtue, common and necessary to all Christians,
   the other as a state, proper to souls who have made a special practice
   of abandonment to the holy will of God.

   The "Letters of Direction," now for the first time translated into
   English, were addressed to Nuns of the Visitation at Nancy. Fr. de
   Caussade had been stationed in this town for some time, and when later
   he was called away, his letters to the Nuns carried on the powerful
   influence he had exercised over them. They were treasured and preserved
   with religious care, and thus have come down to our own days. Fr. de
   Ramière, S. J., collected these letters, and edited them with
   painstaking labour.

   These "Spiritual Letters" are completely suited to the present time;
   Catholic spiritual life being ever the same, there is nothing in them
   which might require alteration or revision. Directors of souls will
   find them an answer to the daily and constantly recurring difficulties
   and trials of the interior life, from the initial difficulties of
   beginners to the hidden trials of souls of great sanctity. Whilst the
   "Letters," from the fact that they were originally written for the
   direction of Nuns, are chiefly intended for Religious, yet earnest
   people living in the world will derive from their perusal a most
   efficacious means for the attainment of resignation and peace in the
   midst of the worries and anxieties of life.

   The leading idea in the letters of Fr. de Caussade is abandonment,
   complete and absolute, to Divine Providence. This was the mainspring of
   his own spiritual life, and the key-note of his direction of souls. He
   promises peace and holiness to every soul, however simple, that follows
   his counsel, if it has an upright intention, and a good will.

   The following extract is from Fr. H. Ramière's preface to the Letters:

   "That which renders Dr. de Caussade's letters especially valuable, and
   makes them useful in an eminently practical manner, is the circumstance
   that they are, for the most part, addressed to persons suffering under
   different kinds of darkness, desolation and trials; in a word, to those
   whom God designs for a high degree of sanctity. To all the doubts
   submitted to him, and to all the sufferings exposed to him by his
   correspondents, the holy Director applied but one and the same solution
   and remedy--abandonment; but, with perfect tact he adapts this practice
   to the particular nature of the trial, and proportions its exercise to
   the degree of perfection to which each soul has attained. The same
   method of direction he applies in a hundred different ways, and
   therefore this correspondence can be justly compared to a ladder by
   which the soul ascends by successive degrees from a still very
   imperfect state, to one of the most intimate union with God, and to the
   most heroic abandonment. To whatever degree a soul has attained we can
   safely promise that it will find in these letters suitable advice and a
   solution of the difficulties by which it is beset. Even those who look
   upon the spiritual life as an inextricable labyrinth will receive from
   the hands of Fr. de Caussade the clue which will enable them to escape
   from the darkness that envelopes them, and to enjoy peace in the midst
   of their uneasiness. May it prove this to all those poor souls who are
   troubled, and who tremble for fear where there is nothing to fear.'
   (Ps. 13). May this book realise the message of the Angels, and bring
   peace to souls of a good will."

   The "Abandonment to Divine Providence" of Fr. de Caussade is as far
   removed from the false inactivity of the Quietists, as true Christian
   resignation is distinct from the fatalism of Mohammedans. It is a
   trusting, childlike, peaceful abandonment to the guidance of grace, and
   of the Holy Spirit: an unquestioning and undoubting submission to the
   holy will of God in all things that may befall us, be they due to the
   action of man, or to the direct permission of God. To Fr. de Caussade,
   abandonment to God, the "Ita Pater" of our Divine Lord, the "Fiat" of
   our Blessed Lady, is the shortest, surest, and easiest way to holiness
   and peace. Fr. de Caussade's work must be read with a certain amount of
   discretion, as naturally every advice he gives does not apply to all
   readers indiscriminately. Some of his counsels may be appropriate for
   beginners; others for souls of a more advanced degree of spirituality.
   No one, however, can fail to recognise in his writings the sure tone of
   a "Master," who has united practical to theoretical knowledge of his
   subject.

   Every page is redolent with the unction of the Spirit of God, and
   readers will find in his doctrine a heavenly manna, a food of unfailing
   strength for their souls. The present work has been carefully
   translated into readable English, and more regard has been paid to the
   meaning than to the literal exactness of the sentences. The elevated,
   noble style of the author has been preserved throughout. It is a real
   contribution to the spiritual literature of England.

   I am aware that our English word "Abandonment" does not adequately
   render the meaning of the French word "Abandon," but we have no better
   expression. The translation has been undertaken solely for the purpose
   of helping souls to follow the hidden paths of the spiritual life, and
   to surrender themselves entirely to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

BOOK I

   ON THE VIRTUE OF ABANDONMENT TO DIVINE PROVIDENCE;
   ITS NATURE AND EXCELLENCE.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   SANCTITY CONSISTS IN FIDELITY TO THE ORDER ESTABLISHED BY
   GOD, AND IN SUBMISSION TO ALL HIS OPERATIONS.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--Hidden Operations of God.

   Fidelity to the order established by God comprehended the whole
   sanctity of the righteous under the old law; even that of St. Joseph,
   and of Mary herself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   God continues to speak to-day as He spoke in former times to our
   fathers when there were no directors as at present, nor any regular
   method of direction. Then all spirituality was comprised in fidelity to
   the designs of God, for there was no regular system of guidance in the
   spiritual life to explain it in detail, nor so many instructions,
   precepts and examples as there are now. Doubtless our present
   difficulties render this necessary, but it was not so in the first ages
   when souls were more simple and straightforward. Then, for those who
   led a spiritual life, each moment brought some duty to be faithfully
   accomplished. Their whole attention was thus concentrated consecutively
   like a hand that marks the hours which, at each moment, traverses the
   space allotted to it. Their minds, incessantly animated by the
   impulsion of divine grace, turned imperceptibly to each new duty that
   presented itself by the permission of God at different hours of the
   day. Such were the hidden springs by which the conduct of Mary was
   actuated. Mary was the most simple of all creatures, and the most
   closely united to God. Her answer to the angel when she said: "Fiat
   mihi secundum verbum tuum": contained all the mystic theology of her
   ancestors to whom everything was reduced, as it is now, to the purest,
   simplest submission of the soul to the will of God, under whatever form
   it presents itself. This beautiful and exalted state, which was the
   basis of the spiritual life of Mary, shines conspicuously in these
   simple words, "Fiat mihi" (Luke i, 38). Take notice that they are in
   complete harmony with those which Our Lord desires that we should have
   always on our lips and in our hearts: "Fiat voluntas tua." It is true
   that what was required of Mary at this great moment, was for her very
   great glory, but the magnificence of this glory would have made no
   impression on her if she had not seen in it the fulfilment of the will
   of God. In all things was she ruled by the divine will. Were her
   occupations ordinary, or of an elevated nature, they were to her but
   the manifestation, sometimes obscure, sometimes clear, of the
   operations of the most High, in which she found alike subject matter
   for the glory of God. Her spirit, transported with joy, looked upon all
   that she had to do or to suffer at each moment as the gift of Him who
   fills with good things the hearts of those who hunger and thirst for
   Him alone, and have no desire for created things.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--The Duties of Each Moment.

   The duties of each moment are the shadows beneath which hides the
   divine operation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "The power of the most High shall over-shadow thee" (Luke i, 35), said
   the angel to Mary. This shadow, beneath which is hidden the power of
   God for the purpose of bringing forth Jesus Christ in the soul, is the
   duty, the attraction, or the cross that is presented to us at each
   moment. These are, in fact, but shadows like those in the order of
   nature which, like a veil, cover sensible objects and hide them from
   us. Therefore in the moral and supernatural order the duties of each
   moment conceal, under the semblance of dark shadows, the truth of their
   divine character which alone should rivet the attention. It was in this
   light that Mary beheld them. Also these shadows diffused over her
   faculties, far from creating illusion, did but increase her faith in
   Him who is unchanging and unchangeable. The archangel may depart. He
   has delivered his message, and his moment has passed. Mary advances
   without ceasing, and is already far beyond him. The Holy Spirit, who
   comes to take possession of her under the shadow of the angel's words,
   will never abandon her.

   There are remarkably few extraordinary characteristics in the outward
   events of the life of the most holy Virgin, at least there are none
   recorded in holy Scripture. Her exterior life is represented as very
   ordinary and simple. She did and suffered the same things that anyone
   in a similar state of life might do or suffer. She goes to visit her
   cousin Elizabeth as her other relatives did. She took shelter in a
   stable in consequence of her poverty. She returned to Nazareth from
   whence she had been driven by the persecution of Herod, and lived there
   with Jesus and Joseph, supporting themselves by the work of their
   hands. It was in this way that the holy family gained their daily
   bread. But what a divine nourishment Mary and Joseph received from this
   daily bread for the strengthening of their faith! It is like a
   sacrament to sanctify all their moments. What treasures of grace lie
   concealed in these moments filled, apparently, by the most ordinary
   events. That which is visible might happen to anyone, but the
   invisible, discerned by faith, is no less than God operating very great
   things. O Bread of Angels! heavenly manna! pearl of the Gospel!
   Sacrament of the present moment! thou givest God under as lowy a form
   as the manger, the hay, or the straw. And to whom dost thou give Him?
   "Esurientes implevit bonis" (Luke i, 53). God reveals Himself to the
   humble under the most lowly forms, but the proud, attaching themselves
   entirely to that which is extrinsic, do not discover Him hidden
   beneath, and are sent empty away.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--The Work of our Sanctification.

   How much more easily sanctity appears when regarded from this point of
   view.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If the work of our sanctification presents, apparently, the most
   insurmountable difficulties, it is because we do not know how to form a
   just idea of it. In reality sanctity can be reduced to one single
   practice, fidelity to the duties appointed by God. Now this fidelity is
   equally within each one's power whether in its active practice, or
   passive exercise.

   The active practice of fidelity consists in accomplishing the duties
   which devolve upon us whether imposed by the general laws of God and of
   the Church, or by the particular state that we may have embraced. Its
   passive exercise consists in the loving acceptance of all that God
   sends us at each moment.

   Are either of these practices of sanctity above our strength? Certainly
   not the active fidelity, since the duties it imposes cease to be duties
   when we have no longer the power to fulfil them. If the state of your
   health does not permit you to go to Mass you are not obliged to go. The
   same rule holds good for all the precepts laid down; that is to say for
   all those which prescribe certain duties. Only those which forbid
   things evil in themselves are absolute, because it is never allowable
   to commit sin. Can there, then, be anything more reasonable? What
   excuse can be made? Yet this is all that God requires of the soul for
   the work of its sanctification. He exacts it from both high and low,
   from the strong and the weak, in a word from all, always and
   everywhere. It is true then that He requires on our part only simple
   and easy things since it is only necessary to employ this simple method
   to attain to an eminent degree of sanctity. If, over and above the
   Commandments, He shows us the counsels as a more perfect aim, He always
   takes care to suit the practice of them to our position and character.
   He bestows on us, as the principal sign of our vocation to follow them,
   the attractions of grace which make them easy. He never impels anyone
   beyond his strength, nor in any way beyond his aptitude. Again, what
   could be more just? All you who strive after perfection and who are
   tempted to discouragement at the remembrance of what you have read in
   the lives of the saints, and of what certain pious books prescribe; O
   you who are appalled by the terrible ideas of perfection that you have
   formed for yourselves; it is for your consolation that God has willed
   me to write this. Learn that of which you seem to be ignorant. This God
   of all goodness has made those things easy which are common and
   necessary in the order of nature, such as breathing, eating, and
   sleeping. No less necessary in the supernatural order are love and
   fidelity, therefore it must needs be that the difficulty of acquiring
   them is by no means so great as is generally represented. Review your
   life. Is it not composed of innumerable actions of very little
   importance? Well, God is quite satisfied with these. They are the share
   that the soul must take in the work of its perfection. This is so
   clearly explained in Holy Scripture that there can be no doubt about
   it: "Fear God and keep the commandments, this is the whole duty of man"
   (Ecclesiastes xii, 13), that is to say--this is all that is required on
   the part of man, and it is in this that active fidelity consists. If
   man fulfils his part God will do the rest. Grace being bestowed only on
   this condition the marvels it effects are beyond the comprehension of
   man. For neither ear has heard nor eye seen, nor has it entered the
   mind what things God has planned in His omniscience, determined in His
   will, and carried out by His power in the souls given up entirely to
   Him. The passive part of sanctity is still more easy since it only
   consists in accepting that which we very often have no power to
   prevent, and in suffering lovingly, that is to say with sweetness and
   consolation, those things that too often cause weariness and disgust.
   Once more I repeat, in this consists sanctity. This is the grain of
   mustard seed which is the smallest of all the seeds, the fruits of
   which can neither be recognised nor gathered. It is the drachma of the
   Gospel, the treasure that none discover because they suppose it to be
   too far away to be sought. Do not ask me how this treasure can be
   found. It is no secret. The treasure is everywhere, it is offered to us
   at all times and wherever we may be. All creatures, both friends and
   enemies pour it out with prodigality, and it flows like a fountain
   through every faculty of body and soul even to the very centre of our
   hearts. If we open our mouths they will be filled. The divine activity
   permeates the whole universe, it pervades every creature; wherever they
   are it is there; it goes before them, with them, and it follows them;
   all they have to do is to let the waves bear them on.

   Would to God that kings, and their ministers, princes of the Church and
   of the world, priests and soldiers, the peasantry and labourers, in a
   word, all men could know how very easy it would be for them to arrive
   at a high degree of sanctity. They would only have to fulfil the simple
   duties of Christianity and of their state of life; to embrace with
   submission the crosses belonging to that state, and to submit with
   faith and love to the designs of Providence in all those things that
   have to be done or suffered without going out of their way to seek
   occasions for themselves. This is the spirit by which the patriarchs
   and prophets were animated and sanctified before there were so many
   systems of so many masters of the spiritual life. [1] This is the
   spirituality of all ages and of every state. No state of life can,
   assuredly, be sanctified in a more exalted manner, nor in a more
   wonderful and easy way than by the simple use of the means that God,
   the sovereign director of souls, gives them to do or to suffer at each
   moment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] It would be a mistaken idea of the meaning of the author to imagine
   that he would urge anyone to undertake to lead a spiritual life without
   the guidance of a director. He explains expressly elsewhere that in
   order to be able to do without a director one must have been habitually
   and for a long time under direction. Less still does he endeavour to
   bring into disrepute the means made use of by the Church for the
   extirpation of vice and the acquisition of virtue. His meaning, of
   which Christians cannot be too often reminded, is, that of all
   direction the best is that of divine providence and that the most
   necessary and the most sanctifying of all practices is that of
   fulfilling faithfully and accepting lovingly whatever this paternal
   Providence ordains that we should do or suffer.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--In what Perfection Consists.

   Perfection consists in doing the will of God, not in understanding His
   designs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The designs of God, the good pleasure of God, the will of God, the
   operation of God and the gift of His grace are all one and the same
   thing in the spiritual life. It is God working in the soul to make it
   like unto Himself. Perfection is neither more nor less than the
   faithful co-operation of the soul with this work of God, and is begun,
   grows, and is consummated in the soul unperceived and in secret. The
   science of theology is full of theories and explanations of the wonders
   of this state in each soul according to its capacity. One may be
   conversant with all these speculations, speak and write about them
   admirably, instruct others and guide souls; yet, if these theories are
   only in the mind, one is, compared with those who, without any
   knowledge of these theories, receive the meaning of the designs of God
   and do His holy will, like a sick physician compared to simple people
   in perfect health. The designs of God and his divine will accepted by a
   faithful soul with simplicity produces this divine state in it without
   its knowledge, just as a medicine taken obediently will produce health,
   although the sick person neither knows nor wishes to know anything
   about medicine. As fire gives out heat, and not philosophical
   discussions about it, nor knowledge of its effects, so the designs of
   God and His holy will work in the soul for its sanctification, and not
   speculations of curiosity as to this principle and this state. When one
   is thirsty one quenches one's thirst by drinking, not by reading books
   which treat of this condition. The desire to know does but increase
   this thirst. Therefore when one thirsts after sanctity, the desire to
   know about it only drives it further away. Speculation must be laid
   aside, and everything arranged by God as regards actions and sufferings
   must be accepted with simplicity, for those things that happen at each
   moment by the divine command or permission are always the most holy,
   the best and the most divine for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION V.--The Divine Influence alone can Sanctify Us.

   No reading, nor any other exercise can sanctify us except in so far as
   they are the channels of the divine influence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our whole science consists in recognising the designs of God for the
   present moment. All reading not intended for us by God is dangerous. It
   is by doing the will of God and obeying His holy inspirations that we
   obtain grace, and this grace works in our hearts through our reading or
   any other employment. Apart from God reading is empty and vain and,
   being deprived for us of the life-giving power of the action of God,
   only succeeds in emptying the heart by the very fullness it gives to
   the mind.

   This divine will, working in the soul of a simple ignorant girl by
   means of sufferings and actions of a very ordinary nature, produces a
   state of supernatural life without the mind being filled with
   self-exalting ideas; whereas the proud man who studies spiritual books
   merely out of curiosity receives no more than the dead letter into his
   mind, and the will of God having no connexion with his reading his
   heart becomes ever harder and more withered.

   The order established by God and His divine will are the life of the
   soul no matter in what way they work, or are obeyed. Whatever connexion
   the divine will has with the mind, it nourishes the soul, and
   continually enlarges it by giving it what is best for it at every
   moment. It is neither one thing nor another which produces these happy
   effects, but what God has willed for each moment. What was best for the
   moment that has passed is so no longer because it is no longer the will
   of God which, becoming apparent through other circumstances, brings to
   light the duty of the present moment. It is this duty under whatever
   guise it presents itself which is precisely that which is the most
   sanctifying for the soul. If, by the divine will, it is a present duty
   to read, then reading will produce the destined effect in the soul. If
   it is the divine will that reading be relinquished for contemplation,
   then this will perform the work of God in the soul and reading would
   become useless and prejudicial. Should the divine will withdraw the
   soul from contemplation for the hearing of confessions, etc., and that
   even for some considerable time, this duty becomes the means of uniting
   the soul with Jesus Christ and all the sweetness of contemplation would
   only serve to destroy this union. Our moments are made fruitful by our
   fulfilment of the will of God. This is presented to us in countless
   different ways by the present duty which forms, increases, and
   consummates in us the new man until we attain the plenitude destined
   for us by the divine wisdom. This mysterious attainment of the age of
   Jesus Christ in our souls is the end ordained by God and the fruit of
   His grace and of His divine goodness.

   This fruit, as we have already said, is produced, nourished and
   increased by the performance of those duties which become successively
   present, and which are made fruitful by the same divine will.

   In fulfilling these duties we are always sure of possessing the "better
   part" because this holy will is itself the better part, it only
   requires to be allowed to act and that we should abandon ourselves
   blindly to it with perfect confidence. It is infinitely wise, powerful
   and amiable to those who trust themselves unreservedly to it, who love
   and seek it alone, and who believe with an unshaken faith and
   confidence that what it arranges for each moment is best, without
   seeking elsewhere for more or less, and without pausing to consider the
   connexion of these exterior works with the plans of God: This would be
   the refinement of self-love.

   Nothing is essential, real, or of any value unless ordained by God who
   arranges all things and makes them useful to the soul. Apart from this
   divine will all is hollow, empty, null, there is nothing but falsehood,
   vanity, nothingness, death. The will of God is the salvation, health
   and life of body and soul, no matter to what subject it is applied. One
   must not, therefore, scrutinize too closely the suitability of things
   to mind or body in order to form a judgement of their value, because
   this is of little importance. It is the will of God which bestows
   through these things, no matter what they may be, an efficacious grace
   by which the image of Jesus Christ is renewed in our souls. One must
   not lay down the law nor impose limits on this divine will since it is
   all-powerful.

   Whatever ideas may fill the mind, whatever feelings afflict the body;
   even if the mind should be tormented with distractions and troubles,
   and the body with sickness and pain, nevertheless the divine will is
   ever for the present moment the life of the soul and of the body; in
   fact, neither the one nor the other, no matter in what condition it may
   be, can be sustained by any other power.

   The divine influence alone can sanctify us. Without it bread may be
   poison, and poison a salutary remedy. Without it reading only darkens
   the mind; with it darkness is made light. It is everything that is good
   and true in all things, and in all things it unites us to God, who,
   being infinite in all perfections, leaves nothing to be desired by the
   soul that possesses Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VI.--On the Use of Mental Faculties.

   The exercise of mental and other faculties is only useful when
   instrumental of the divine action.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The mind with all the consequences of its activity might take the
   foremost rank among the tools employed by God, but has to be deputed to
   the lowest as a dangerous slave. It might be of great service if made
   use of in a right manner, but is a danger if not kept in subjection.
   When the soul longs for outward help it is made to understand that the
   divine action is sufficient for it. When without reason it would
   disclaim this outward help, the divine action shows it that such help
   should be received and adapted with simplicity in obedience to the
   order established by God, and that we should use it as a tool, not for
   its own sake but as though we used it not, and when deprived of all
   help as though we wanted nothing.

   The divine action although of infinite power can only take full
   possession of the soul in so far as it is void of all confidence in its
   own action; for this confidence, being founded on a false idea of its
   own capacity, excludes the divine action. This is the obstacle most
   likely to arrest it, being in the soul itself; for, as regards
   obstacles that are exterior, God can change them if He so pleases into
   means for making progress. All is alike to Him, equally useful, or
   equally useless. Without the divine action all things are as nothing,
   and with it the veriest nothing can be turned to account.

   Whether it be meditation, contemplation, vocal prayer, interior
   silence, or the active use of any of the faculties, either sensible and
   distinct, or almost imperceptible; quiet retreat, or active employment,
   whatever it may be in itself, even if very desirable, that which God
   wills for the present moment is best and all else must be regarded by
   the soul as being nothing at all. Thus, beholding God in all things it
   must take or leave them all as He pleases, and neither desire to live,
   nor to improve, nor to hope, except as He ordains, and never by the
   help of things which have neither power nor virtue except from Him. It
   ought, at every moment and on all occasions, to say with St. Paul,
   "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts ix, 6) without choosing
   this thing or that, but "whatsoever You will. The mind prefers one
   thing, the body another, but, Lord, I desire nothing but to accomplish
   Your holy will. Work, contemplation or prayer whether vocal or mental,
   active or passive; the prayer of faith or of understanding; that which
   is distinguished in kind, or gifted with universal grace: it is all
   nothing Lord unless made real and useful by Your will. It is to Your
   holy will that I devote myself and not to any of these things, however
   high and sublime they may be, because it is the perfection of the heart
   for which grace is given, and not for that of the mind."

   The presence of God which sanctifies our souls is the dwelling of the
   Holy Trinity in the depths of our hearts when they submit to His holy
   will. The act of the presence of God made in contemplation effects this
   intimate union only like other acts that are according to the order of
   God.

   There is, therefore, nothing unlawful in the love and esteem we have
   for contemplation and other pious exercises, if this love and esteem
   are directed entirely to the God of all goodness who willingly makes
   use of these means to unite our souls to Himself.

   In entertaining the suite of a prince, one entertains the prince
   himself, and he would consider any discourtesy shown to his officers
   under pretence of wishing for him alone as an insult to himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VII.--On the Attainment of Peace.

   There is no solid peace except in submission to the divine action.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The soul that does not attach itself solely to the will of God will
   find neither satisfaction nor sanctification in any other means however
   excellent by which it may attempt to gain them. If that which God
   Himself chooses for you does not content you, from whom do you expect
   to obtain what you desire? If you are disgusted with the meat prepared
   for you by the divine will itself, what food would not be insipid to so
   depraved a taste? No soul can be really nourished, fortified, purified,
   enriched, and sanctified except in fulfilling the duties of the present
   moment. What more would you have? As in this you can find all good, why
   seek it elsewhere? Do you know better than God? As he ordains it thus
   why do you desire it differently? Can His wisdom and goodness be
   deceived? When you find something to be in accordance with this divine
   wisdom and goodness ought you not to conclude that it must needs be
   excellent? Do you imagine you will find peace in resisting the
   Almighty? Is it not, on the contrary, this resistance which we too
   often continue without owning it even to ourselves which is the cause
   of all our troubles? It is only just, therefore, that the soul that is
   dissatisfied with the divine action for each present moment should be
   punished by being unable to find happiness in anything else. If books,
   the example of the saints, and spiritual conversations deprive the soul
   of peace; if they fill the mind without satisfying it; it is a sign
   that one has strayed from the path of pure abandonment to the divine
   action, and that one is only seeking to please oneself. To be employed
   in this way is to prevent God from finding an entrance. All this must
   be got rid of because of being an obstacle to grace. But if the divine
   will ordains the use of these things the soul may receive them like the
   rest--that is to say--as the means ordained by God which it accepts
   simply to use, and leaves afterwards when their moment has passed for
   the duties of the moment that follows. There is, in fact, nothing
   really good that does not emanate from the ordinance of God, and
   nothing, however good in itself, can be better adapted for the
   sanctification of the soul and the attainment of peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VIII.--To Estimate Degrees of Excellence.

   The perfection of souls, and the degree of excellence to which they
   have attained can be gauged by their fidelity to the order established
   by God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The will of God gives to all things a supernatural and divine value for
   the soul submitting to it. The duties it imposes, and those it
   contains, with all the matters over which it is diffused, become holy
   and perfect, because, being unlimited in power, everything it touches
   shares its divine character. But in order not to stray either to the
   right or to the left the soul should only attend to those inspirations
   which it believes it has received from God, by the fact that these
   inspirations do not withdraw it from the duties of its state. Those
   duties are the most clear manifestation of the will of God, and nothing
   should take their place; in them there is nothing to fear, nothing to
   exclude, nor anything to be chosen. The time occupied in the fulfilment
   of these duties is very precious and very salutary for the soul by the
   indubitable fact that it is spent in accomplishing this holy will. The
   entire virtue of all that is called holy is in its approximation to
   this order established by God; therefore nothing should be rejected,
   nothing sought after, but everything accepted that is ordained and
   nothing attempted contrary to the will of God.

   Books and wise counsels, vocal prayer and interior affections if they
   are in accordance with the will of God are instructive, and all help to
   guide and to unify. In contemning all sensible means to this end
   quietism is greatly to blame, for there are souls that are intended by
   God to keep always to this way. Their state of life and their
   attraction show this clearly enough. It is vain to picture any kind of
   abandonment from which all personal activity is excluded. When God
   requires action, sanctity is to be found in activity. Besides the
   duties imposed on everyone by their state of life God may require
   certain actions which are not included in these duties, although they
   may not be in any way opposed to them. An attraction and inspiration
   are then the signs of the divine approval. Souls conducted by God in
   this way will find a greater perfection in adding the things inspired
   to those that are commanded, taking the necessary precautions required
   in such cases, that the duties of their state may not clash with those
   things arranged by Providence.

   God makes saints as He pleases, but they are made always according to
   His plan, and in submission to His will. This submission is true and
   most perfect abandonment.

   Duties imposed by the state of life and by divine Providence are common
   to all the saints and are what God arranges for all in general. They
   live hidden from the world which is so evil that they are obliged to
   avoid its dangers: but it is not on this account that they are saints,
   but only on account of their submission to the will of God. The more
   absolute this submission becomes the higher becomes their sanctity. We
   must not imagine that those whose virtue is shown in wonderful and
   singular ways, and by unquestionable attractions and inspirations,
   advance less on that account in the way of abandonment. From the moment
   that these acts become duties by the will of God, then to be content
   only to fulfil the duties of a state of life, or the ordinary
   inspirations of Providence would be to resist God, whose holy will
   would no longer retain the mastery of the passing moments, and to cease
   practising the virtue of abandonment. Our duties must be so arranged as
   to be commensurate with the designs of God, and to follow the path
   designated by our attraction. To carry out our inspirations will then
   become a duty to which we must be faithful. As there are souls whose
   whole duty is defined by exterior laws, and who should not go beyond
   them because restricted by the will of God; so also there are others
   who, besides exterior duties, are obliged to carry out faithfully that
   interior rule imprinted on their hearts. It would be a foolish and
   frivolous curiosity to try to discover which is the most holy. Each has
   to follow the appointed path. Perfection consists in submitting
   unreservedly to the designs of God, and in fulfilling the duties of
   one's state in the most perfect manner possible. To compare the
   different states as they are in themselves can do nothing to improve
   us, since it is neither in the amount of work, nor in the sort of
   duties given to us that perfection is to be found. If self-love is the
   motive power of our acts, or if it be not immediately crushed when
   discovered, our supposed abundance will be in truth absolute poverty
   because it is not supplied by obedience to the will of God. However, to
   decide the question in some way, I think that holiness can be measured
   by the love one has for God, and the desire to please Him, and that the
   more His will is the guiding principle, and His plans conformed to and
   loved, the greater will be the holiness, no matter what may be the
   means made use of. It is this that we notice in Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
   In their separate lives there is more of love than of greatness, and
   more of the spirit than of the matter. It is not written that they
   sought holiness in things themselves, but only in the motive with which
   they used them. It must therefore be concluded that one way is not more
   perfect than another, but that the most perfect is that which is most
   closely in conformity with the order established by God, whether by the
   accomplishment of exterior duties, or by interior dispositions.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IX.--Sanctity Made Easy.

   Conclusion of the first chapter. How easy sanctity becomes when this
   doctrine is properly understood.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I believe that if those souls that tend towards sanctity were
   instructed as to the conduct they ought to follow, they would be spared
   a good deal of trouble. I speak as much of people in the world as of
   others. If they could realise the merit concealed in the actions of
   each moment of the day: I mean in each of the daily duties of their
   state of life, and if they could be persuaded that sanctity is founded
   on that to which they give no heed as being altogether irrelevant, they
   would indeed be happy. If, besides, they understood that to attain the
   utmost height of perfection, the safest and surest way is to accept the
   crosses sent them by Providence at every moment, that the true
   philosopher's stone is submission to the will of God which changes into
   divine gold all their occupations, troubles, and sufferings, what
   consolation would be theirs! What courage would they not derive from
   the thought that to acquire the friendship of God, and to arrive at
   eternal glory, they had but to do what they were doing, but to suffer
   what they were suffering, and that what they wasted and counted as
   nothing would suffice to enable them to arrive at eminent sanctity: far
   more so than extraordinary states and wonderful works. O my God! how
   much I long to be the missionary of Your holy will, and to teach all
   men that there is nothing more easy, more attainable, more within
   reach, and in the power of everyone, than sanctity. How I wish that I
   could make them understand that just as the good and the bad thief had
   the same things to do and to suffer; so also two persons, one of whom
   is worldly and the other leading an interior and wholly spiritual life
   have, neither of them, anything different to do or to suffer; but that
   one is sanctified and attains eternal happiness by submission to Your
   holy will in those very things by which the other is damned because he
   does them to please himself, or endures them with reluctance and
   rebellion. This proves that it is only the heart that is different. Oh!
   all you that read this, it will cost you no more than to do what you
   are doing, to suffer what you are suffering, only act and suffer in a
   holy manner. It is the heart that must be changed. When I say heart, I
   mean will. Sanctity, then, consists in willing all that God wills for
   us. Yes! sanctity of heart is a simple "fiat," a conformity of will
   with the will of God.

   What could be more easy, and who could refuse to love a will so kind
   and so good? Let us love it then, and this love alone will make
   everything in us divine.

  CHAPTER II.

    THE DIVINE ACTION WORKS UNCEASINGLY FOR THE SANCTIFICATION OF SOULS.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--The Divine Action.

   The divine action, although only visible to the eye of faith, is
   everywhere, and always present.
     __________________________________________________________________

   All creatures that exist are in the hands of God. The action of the
   creature can only be perceived by the senses, but faith sees in all
   things the action of the Creator. It believes that in Jesus Christ all
   things live, and that His divine operation continues to the end of
   time, embracing the passing moment and the smallest created atom in its
   hidden life and mysterious action. The action of the creature is a veil
   which covers the profound mysteries of the divine operation. After the
   Resurrection Jesus Christ took His disciples by surprise in His various
   apparitions. He showed Himself to them under various disguises and, in
   the act of making Himself known to them, disappeared. This same Jesus,
   ever living, ever working, still takes by surprise those souls whose
   faith is weak and wavering.

   There is not a moment in which God does not present Himself under the
   cover of some pain to be endured, of some consolation to be enjoyed, or
   of some duty to be performed. All that takes place within us, around
   us, or through us, contains and conceals His divine action.

   It is really and truly there present, but invisibly present, so that we
   are always surprised and do not recognise His operation until it has
   ceased. If we could lift the veil, and if we were attentive and
   watchful God would continually reveal Himself to us, and we should see
   His divine action in everything that happened to us, and rejoice in it.
   At each successive occurrence we should exclaim: "It is the Lord," and
   we should accept every fresh circumstance as a gift of God. We should
   look upon creatures as feeble tools in the hands of an able workman,
   and should discover easily that nothing was wanting to us, and that the
   constant providence of God disposed Him to bestow upon us at every
   moment whatever we required. If only we had faith we should show
   good-will to all creatures; we should cherish them and be interiorly
   grateful to them as serving, by God's will, for our perfection. If we
   lived the life of faith without intermission we should have an
   uninterrupted commerce with God and a constant familiar intercourse
   with Him. What the air is for the transmission of our thoughts and
   words, such would be our actions and sufferings for those of God. They
   would be as the substance of His words, and in all external events we
   should see nothing but what was excellent and holy. This union is
   effected on earth by faith, in Heaven by glory; the only difference is
   in the method of its working. God is interpreted by faith. Without the
   light of faith creation would speak to us in vain. It is a writing in
   cypher in which we find nothing but confusion, and entangled mesh from
   which no one would expect to hear the voice of God. But as Moses saw
   the fire of divine charity in the burning bush, so faith gives us the
   clue to the cypher, and reveals to us, in this mass of confusion,
   marvels of divine wisdom. Faith changes the face of the earth; by it
   the heart is raised, entranced and becomes conversant with heavenly
   things. Faith is our light in this life. By it we possess the truth
   without seeing it; we touch what we cannot feel, and see what is not
   evident to the senses. By it we view the world as though it did not
   exist. It is the key of the treasure house, the key of the abyss of the
   science of God. It is faith that teaches us the hollowness of created
   things; By it God reveals and manifests Himself in all things. By faith
   the veil is torn aside to reveal the eternal truth.

   All that we see is nothing but vanity and deceit; truth can be found
   only in God. What a difference between the thoughts of God and the
   illusions of man! How is it that although continually warned that
   everything that happens in the world is but a shadow, a figure, a
   mystery of faith, we look at the outside only and do not perceive the
   enigma they contain?

   We fall into this trap like men without sense instead of raising our
   eyes to the principle, source and origin of all things, in which they
   all have their right name and just proportions, in which everything is
   supernatural, divine, and sanctifying; in which all is part of the
   plenitude of Jesus Christ, and each circumstance is as a stone towards
   the construction of the heavenly Jerusalem, and all helps to build a
   dwelling for us in that marvellous city.

   We live according to what we see and feel and wander like madmen in a
   labyrinth of darkness and illusion for want of the light of faith which
   would guide us safely through it. By means of faith we should be able
   to aspire after God and to live for Him alone, forsaking and going
   beyond mere figures.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--By Faith the Operation of God is recognised.

   The more hidden the divine operation beneath an outwardly repulsive
   appearance, the more visible it is to the eye of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The soul, enlightened by faith, judges of things in a very different
   way to those who, having only the standard of the senses by which to
   measure them, ignore the inestimable treasure they contain. He who
   knows that a certain person in disguise is the king, behaves towards
   him very differently to another who, only perceiving an ordinary man,
   treats him accordingly. In the same way the soul that recognises the
   will of God in every smallest event, and also in those that are most
   distressing and direful, receives all with an equal joy, pleasure and
   respect. It throws open all its doors to receive with honour what
   others fear and fly from with horror. The outward appearance may be
   mean and contemptible, but beneath this abject garb the heart discovers
   and honours the majesty of the king. The deeper the abasement of his
   entry in such a guise and in secret the more does the heart become
   filled with love. I cannot describe what the heart feels when it
   accepts the divine will in such humble, poor, and mean disguises. Ah!
   how the sight of God, poor and humble, lodged in a stable, lying on
   straw, weeping and trembling, pierced the loving heart of Mary! Ask the
   inhabitants of Bethlehem what they thought of the Child. You know what
   answer they gave, and how they would have paid court to Him had He been
   lodged in a palace surrounded by the state due to princes.

   Then ask Mary and Joseph, the Magi and the Shepherds. They will tell
   you that they found in this extreme poverty an indescribable
   tenderness, and an infinite dignity worthy of the majesty of God. Faith
   is strengthened, increased and enriched by those things that escape the
   senses; the less there is to see, the more there is to believe. To
   adore Jesus on Thabor, to accept the will of God in extraordinary
   circumstances does not indicate a life animated by such great faith as
   to love the will of God in ordinary things and to adore Jesus on the
   Cross; for faith cannot be said to be real, living faith until it is
   tried, and has triumphed over every effort for its destruction. War
   with the senses enables faith to obtain a more glorious victory. To
   consider God equally good in things that are petty and ordinary as in
   those that are great and uncommon is to have a faith that is not
   ordinary, but great and extraordinary.

   To be satisfied with the present moment is to delight in, and to adore
   the divine will in all that has to be done or suffered in all that
   succession of events that fill, as they pass, each present moment.
   Those souls that have this disposition adore God with redoubled love
   and respect in each consecutive humiliating condition; nothing can hide
   Him from the piercing eye of faith. The louder the senses proclaim that
   in this, or that, there is no God; the more firmly do these souls clasp
   and embrace their "bundle of myrrh." Nothing daunts them, nothing
   disgusts them.

   Mary, when the apostles fled, remained steadfast at the foot of the
   Cross. She owned Jesus as her Son when He was disfigured with wounds,
   and covered with mud and spittle. The wounds that disfigured Him made
   Him only more lovable and adorable in the eyes of this tender Mother.
   The more awful were the blasphemies uttered against Him, so much the
   deeper became her veneration and respect.

   The life of faith is nothing less than the continued pursuit of God
   through all that disguises, disfigures, destroys and, so to say,
   annihilates Him. It is in very truth a reproduction of the life of Mary
   who, from the Stable to the Cross, remained unalterably united to that
   God whom all the world misunderstood, abandoned, and persecuted. In
   like manner faithful souls endure a constant succession of trials. God
   hides beneath veils of darkness and illusive appearances which make His
   will difficult to recognise; but in spite of every obstacle these souls
   follow Him and love Him even to the death of the Cross. They know that,
   leaving the darkness they must run after the light of this divine Sun
   which, from its rising to its setting, however dark and thick may be
   the clouds that obscure it, enlightens, warms, and inflames the
   faithful hearts that bless, praise and contemplate it during the whole
   circle of its mysterious course.

   Pursue then without ceasing, ye faithful souls, this beloved Spouse who
   with giant strides passes from one extremity of the heavens to the
   other. If you be content and untiring nothing will have power to hide
   Him from you. He moves above the smallest blades of grass as above the
   mighty cedar. The grains of sand are under His feet as well as the huge
   mountains. Wherever you may turn, there you will find His footprints,
   and in following them perseveringly you will find Him wherever you may
   be.

   Oh! what delightful peace we enjoy when we have learnt by faith to find
   God thus in all His creatures! Then is darkness luminous, and
   bitterness sweet. Faith, while showing us things as they are, changes
   their ugliness into beauty, and their malice into virtue. Faith is the
   mother of sweetness, confidence and joy. It cannot help feeling
   tenderness and compassion for its enemies by whose means it is so
   immeasurably enriched. The greater the harshness and severity of the
   creature, the greater by the operation of God, is the advantage to the
   soul. While the human instrument strives to do harm, the divine Workman
   in whose hands it is, makes use of its very malice to remove from the
   soul all that might be prejudicial to it.

   The will of God has nothing but sweetness, favours and treasures for
   submissive souls; it is impossible to repose too much confidence in it,
   nor to abandon oneself to it too utterly. It always acts for, and
   desires that which is most conducive to our perfection, provided we
   allow it to act. Faith does not doubt. The more unfaithful, uncertain,
   and rebellious are the senses, the louder faith cries: "all is well, it
   is the will of God." There is nothing that the eye of faith does not
   penetrate, nothing that the power of faith does not overcome. It passes
   through the thick darkness, and, no matter what clouds may gather, it
   goes straight to the truth, and holding to it firmly will never let it
   go.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--How to Discover what is the Will of God.

   The divine action places before us at every moment things of infinite
   value, and gives them to us according to the measure of our faith and
   love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If we understood how to see in each moment some manifestation of the
   will of God we should find therein also all that our hearts could
   desire. In fact there could be nothing more reasonable, more perfect,
   more divine than the will of God. Could any change of time, place, or
   circumstance alter or increase its infinite value? If you possess the
   secret of discovering it at every moment and in everything, then you
   possess all that is most precious, and most worthy to be desired. What
   is it that you desire, you who aim at perfection? Give yourselves full
   scope. Your wishes need have no measure, no limit. However much you may
   desire I can show you how to attain it, even though it be infinite.
   There is never a moment in which I cannot enable you to obtain all that
   you can desire. The present is ever filled with infinite treasure, it
   contains more than you have capacity to hold. Faith is the measure.
   Believe, and it will be done to you accordingly. Love also is the
   measure. The more the heart loves, the more it desires; and the more it
   desires, so much the more will it receive. The will of God is at each
   moment before us like an immense, inexhaustible ocean that no human
   heart can fathom; but none can receive from it more than he has
   capacity to contain, it is necessary to enlarge this capacity by faith,
   confidence, and love.

   The whole creation cannot fill the human heart, for it is greater than
   all that is not God. It is on a higher plane than the material
   creation, and for this reason nothing material can satisfy it. The
   divine will is a deep abyss of which the present moment is the
   entrance. If you plunge into this abyss you will find it infinitely
   more vast than your desires. Do not flatter anyone, nor worship your
   own illusions, they can neither give you anything nor receive anything
   from you. Receive your fulness from the will of God alone, it will not
   leave you empty. Adore it, put it first, before all things; tear all
   disguises from vain pretences and forsake them all going straight to
   the sole reality. The reign of faith is death to the senses; it is
   their spoliation, their destruction. The senses worship creatures;
   faith adores the divine will. Destroy the idols of the senses and they
   will rebel and lament, but faith must triumph because the will of God
   is indestructible. When the senses are terrified, or famished,
   despoiled, or crushed, then it is that faith is nourished, enriched and
   enlivened. Faith laughs at these calamities as a governor of an
   impregnable fortress laughs at the useless attacks of an impotent foe.
   When a soul recognises the will of God and shows a readiness to submit
   to it entirely, then God gives Himself to such a soul and renders it
   most powerful succour under all circumstances. Thus it experiences a
   great happiness in this coming of God, and enjoys it the more, the more
   it has learnt to abandon itself at every moment to His adorable will.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--The Revelations of God.

   God reveals Himself to us in as mysterious a manner in the most
   ordinary circumstances, and as truly and adorably as in the great
   events of History or of Holy Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The written word of God is full of mystery; and no less so His word
   fulfilled in the events of the world. These are two sealed books, and
   of both it can be said "the letter killeth." God is the centre of
   faith; all that emanates from this centre is hidden in the deepest
   mystery. This word and these events are, so to say, but feeble rays
   from a sun obscured by clouds. It is vain to expect to see with our
   mortal eyes the rays of this sun; even the eyes of our soul are blind
   to God and His works. Darkness takes the place of light, ignorance of
   knowledge, and one neither sees nor understands. The sacred Scripture
   is the mysterious utterance of a God yet more mysterious and the events
   of the world are the obscure language of this same hidden and unknown
   God. They are mere drops from an ocean of midnight darkness, and
   partake of the nature of their source. The fall of the angels and of
   Adam; the impiety and idolatry of men before and after the Deluge up to
   the time of the Patriarchs who knew, and related to their children the
   history of the Creation, and of the still recent preservation from the
   universal deluge; these are, indeed, very obscure words of holy
   Scripture. That, at the coming of the Messiah, only a handful of men
   should be preserved from idolatry in the general ruin and overthrow of
   faith throughout the world: that impiety should prove always dominant,
   always powerful, and the small numbers of the upholders of truth should
   be ever persecuted and maltreated, seems incredible! Consider the
   treatment of Jesus Christ. Think of the plagues of the Apocalypse, yet
   these are words of God. They are what He has revealed! He has dictated
   them! And the effect of these terrible mysteries which will continue
   till the end of time is still the living word, teaching us His wisdom,
   power, and goodness. All the events which form the world's history show
   forth these divine attributes; all teach the same adorable word. We
   cannot doubt it, although we do not see. What is meant by the existence
   of Turks, heretics, and all the other enemies of the Church? Surely
   they all proclaim loudly the divine perfections. Pharaoh and the
   impious men who follow his example are allowed to exist only for that
   purpose, but assuredly, unless beheld with the eye of faith, it would
   all have the exactly contrary appearance. To behold divine mysteries it
   is necessary to shut the eyes to what is external, and to cease to
   reason. You speak, Lord, to the generality of men by great public
   events. Every resolution is as a wave from the sea of Your providence,
   raising storms and tempests in the minds of those who question Your
   mysterious action. You speak also to each individual soul by the
   circumstances occurring at every moment of life. Instead, however, of
   hearing Your voice in these events, and receiving with awe what is
   obscure and mysterious in these Your words, men see in their only the
   outward aspect, or chance, or the caprice of others, and censure
   everything. They would like to add, or diminish, or reform, and to
   allow themselves absolute liberty to commit any excess, the least of
   which would be a criminal and unheard-of outrage. They respect the holy
   Scriptures, however, and will not permit the addition of even a single
   comma. "It is the word of God" say they, "and is altogether holy and
   true. If we cannot understand it, it is all the more wonderful and we
   must give glory to God, and render justice to the depths of His
   wisdom." All this is perfectly true, but when you read God's word from
   moment to moment, not written with ink on paper, but on your soul with
   suffering, and the daily actions that you have to perform, does it not
   merit some attention on your part? How is it that you cannot see the
   will of God in all this? Instead you find fault with everything that
   happens, nothing pleases you. Do you not see that you are gauging
   everything by the senses, and by reason, not by faith the only true
   standard; and that when you read the word of God in the sacred
   Scriptures with the eye of faith, you do wrong to make use only of your
   reason in reading the word in His marvellous operations.

    SECTION V.--The action of Jesus Christ in the Souls of Men.

   The divine action continues to write in the hearts of men the work
   begun by the holy Scriptures, but the characters made use of in this
   writing will not be visible till the day of judgment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Jesus Christ yesterday, to-day, and for ever" (Heb. xiii, 8), says the
   Apostle. From the beginning of the world He was, as God, the first
   cause of the existence of souls. He has participated as man from the
   first instant of His incarnation, in this prerogative of His divinity.
   During the whole course of our life He acts within our souls. The time
   that will elapse till the end of the world is but as a day; and this
   day abounds with His action. Jesus Christ has lived and lives still. He
   began from Himself and will continue in His Saints a life that will
   never end. O life of Jesus! comprehending and extending beyond all the
   centuries of time, life effecting new operations of grace at every
   moment; if no one is capable of understanding all that could be written
   of the actual life of Jesus, all that He did and said while He was on
   earth; if the Gospel merely outlines a few of its features; how many
   Gospels would have to be written to record the history of all the
   moments of this mystical life of Jesus Christ in which miracles are
   multiplied to infinity and eternity. If the beginning of His natural
   life is so hidden yet so fruitful, what can be said of the divine
   action of that life of which every age of the world is the history?

   The Holy Spirit has pointed out in infallible and incontestable
   characters, some moments in that ocean of time, in the Sacred
   Scriptures. In them we see by what secret and mysterious ways He has
   brought Jesus before the world. Amidst the confusion of the races of
   men can be distinguished the origin, race, and genealogy of this, the
   first-born. The whole of the Old Testament is but an outline of the
   profound mystery of this divine work; it contains only what is
   necessary to relate concerning the advent of Jesus Christ. The Holy
   Spirit has kept all the rest hidden among the treasures of His wisdom.
   From this ocean of the divine activity He only allows a tiny stream to
   escape, and this stream having gained its way to Jesus is lost in the
   Apostles, and has been engulfed in the Apocalypse; so that the history
   of this divine activity consisting of the life of Jesus in the souls of
   the just to the end of time, can only be divined by faith. As the truth
   of God has been made known by word of mouth, so His charity is
   manifested by action. The Holy Spirit continues to carry on the work of
   our Saviour. While helping the Church to preach the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ, He writes His own Gospel in the hearts of the just. All their
   actions, every moment of their lives, are the Gospel of the Holy
   Spirit. The souls of the saints are the paper, the sufferings and
   actions the ink. The Holy Spirit with the pen of His power writes a
   living Gospel, but a Gospel that cannot be read until it has left the
   press of this life, and has been published on the day of eternity. Oh!
   great history! grand book written by the Holy Spirit in this present
   time! It is still in the press. There is never a day when the type is
   not arranged, when the ink is not applied, or the pages are not primed.
   We are still in the dark night of faith. The paper is blacker than the
   ink, and there is great confusion in the type. It is written in
   characters of another world and there is no understanding it except in
   Heaven. If we could see the life of God, and behold all creatures, not
   as they are in themselves, but as they exist in their first cause; and
   if again we could see the life of God in all His creatures, and could
   understand how the divine action animates them, and impels them all to
   press forward by different ways to the same goal, we should realize
   that all has a meaning, a measure, a connexion in this divine work. But
   how can we read a book the characters of which are foreign to us, the
   letters innumerable, the type reversed, and the pages blotted with ink?
   If the transposition of twenty-five letters is incomprehensible as
   sufficing for the composition of a well-nigh infinite number of
   different volumes, each admirable of its kind, who can explain the
   works of God in the universe? Who can read and understand the meaning
   of so vast a book in which there is no letter but has its particular
   character, and encloses in its apparent insignificance the most
   profound mysteries? Mysteries can neither be seen nor felt, they are
   objects of faith. Faith judges of their virtue and truth only by their
   origin, for they are so obscure in themselves that all that they show
   only serves to hide them and to blind those who judge only by reason.

   "Teach me, divine Spirit, to read in this book of life. I desire to
   become Your disciple and, like a little child, to believe what I cannot
   understand, and cannot see. Sufficient for me that it is my Master who
   speaks. He says that! He pronounces this! He arranges the letters in
   such a fashion! He makes Himself heard in such a manner! That is
   enough. I decide that all is exactly as He says. I do not see the
   reason, but He is the infallible truth, therefore all that He says, all
   that He does is true. He groups His letters to form a word, and
   different letters again to form another word. There may be three only,
   or six; then no more are necessary, and fewer would destroy the sense.
   He who reads the thoughts of men is the only one who can bring these
   letters together, and write the words. All has meaning, all has perfect
   sense. This line ends here because He makes it do so. Not a comma is
   missing, and there is no unnecessary full-stop. At present I believe,
   but in the glory to come when so many mysteries will be revealed, I
   shall see plainly what now I so little understand.

   Then what appears to me at present so intricate, so perplexing, so
   foolish, so inconsistent, so imaginary, will all be entrancing and will
   delight me eternally by the beauty, order, knowledge, wisdom, and the
   incomprehensible wonders it will all display."
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VI.--The Treatment of the Divine Action.

   The divine action as manifested in daily events is treated by many
   Christians in as unworthy a manner as the Jews treated the Sacred Body
   of Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The world is full of infidelity. How unworthy are its thoughts of God!
   It complains continually of the divine action in a way that it would
   not dare to use towards the lowest workman about his trade. It would
   reduce God to act only within the limits, and following the rules of
   its feeble reason. It presumes to imagine it can improve upon His acts.
   These are nothing but complaints and murmurings. We are surprised at
   the treatment endured by Jesus Christ at the hands of the Jews, but, O
   divine love! adorable will! infallible truth! in what way are you
   treated? Can the divine will ever be inopportune? Can it be mistaken?
   "But there is this business of mine! I require such a thing! The
   necessary helps have been taken from me. That man thwarts all my good
   works, is it not most unreasonable? This illness comes on just when my
   health is most necessary to me." To all this there is but one
   answer--that the will of God is the only thing necessary, therefore
   what it does not grant must be useless. My good souls! nothing is
   wanting to you. If you only knew what these events really are that you
   call misfortunes, accidents, and disappointments, and in which you can
   see nothing but what is irrelevant, or unreasonable, you would lie
   deeply ashamed and excuse yourselves of your complainings as of
   blasphemies; but you never think of them as being the will of God, and
   His adorable will is blasphemed by His own children who refuse to
   acknowledge it. When You were on earth, O my Jesus, the Jews treated
   You as a demonaic, and called You a Samaritan; and now, although it is
   acknowledged that You live and work through all the centuries of time,
   how is Your adorable will received? that will worthy of all benediction
   and praise for ever. Has one moment passed from the creation to the
   present time, and will one moment pass even to the day of judgment in
   which the holy name of God will not deserve praise; that name which
   fills all the ages, and everything which takes place in the ages, that
   name by which everything is sanctified? What! can the will of God do me
   harm? Shall I fear, or fly from the will of God? And where shall I find
   anything better if I dread the divine action in my regard, or regret
   the effect of His divine will? We ought to listen attentively to the
   words uttered in the depths of our heart at every moment. If our sense
   and reason do not understand nor enter into the truth and goodness of
   these words, is it not because they are incapable of appreciating
   divine truths? Ought I to wonder that my reason is bewildered by
   mysteries? When God speaks it is a mystery, and therefore a death-blow
   to my senses and reason, for it is the nature of mysteries to compel
   the sacrifice of both. Mystery makes the soul live by faith; for all
   the rest there is nothing but contradiction. The divine action by one
   and the same stroke kills and gives life; the more one feels the death
   to the senses and reason, the more convinced should one become that it
   gives life to the soul. The more obscure the mystery to us, the more
   light it contains in itself. This is why a simple soul will discover a
   more divine meaning in that which has the least appearance of having
   any.

   The life of faith is a continual struggle against the senses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VII.--The Hidden Work of Divine Love.

   The divine love is communicated to us through every creature under
   veils, like the Eucharistic species.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What great truths are hidden even from Christians who imagine
   themselves most enlightened! How many are there amongst them who
   understand that every cross, every action, every attraction according
   to the designs of God, give God to us in a way that nothing can better
   explain than a comparison with the most august mystery? Nevertheless
   there is nothing more certain. Does not reason as well as faith reveal
   to us the real presence of divine love in all creatures, and in all the
   events of life, as indubitably as the words of Jesus Christ and of the
   Church reveal the real presence of the sacred flesh of our Saviour
   under the Eucharistic species? Do we not know that by all creatures,
   and by every event the divine love desires to unite us to Himself, that
   He has ordained, arranged, or permitted everything about us, everything
   that happens to us with a view to this union? This is the ultimate
   object of all His designs to attain which He makes use of the worst of
   His creatures as well as of the best, and of the most distressing
   events as well as of those which are pleasant and agreeable. Our
   communion with Him is even more meritorious when the means that serve
   to make it closer are repugnant to nature. If this be true, every
   moment of our lives may be a kind of communion with the divine love,
   and this communion of every moment may produce as much fruit in our
   souls as that which we receive in the Communion of the Body and Blood
   of the Son of God. This latter, it is true, is efficacious
   sacramentally which the former cannot be, but on the other hand, how
   much more frequently can it not be renewed, and what great increase of
   merit it can acquire by the more perfect dispositions with which it may
   be accomplished. Consequently how true it is that the more holy the
   life the more mysterious it becomes by its apparent simplicity and
   littleness. O great feast! O perpetual festival! God! given and
   received under all that is most feeble, foolish and worthless upon
   earth! God chooses that which nature abhors, and human prudence
   rejects. Of these He makes mysteries, sacraments of love, and by that
   which seems as if it would do most harm to souls, He gives Himself to
   them as often and as much as they desire to possess Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VIII.--Experimental Science.

   That which is sent us at the present moment is the most useful because
   it is intended especially for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   We can only be well instructed by the words which God utters expressly
   for us. No one becomes learned in the science of God either by the
   reading of books, or by the inquisitive investigation of history. The
   science that is acquired by such means is vain and confused, producing
   much pride. That which instructs us is what happens from one moment to
   another producing in us that experimental science which Jesus Christ
   Himself willed to acquire before instructing others. In fact this was
   the only science in which He could grow, according to the expression of
   the holy Gospel; because being God there was no degree of speculative
   science which He did not possess. Therefore if this experimental
   science was useful to the word incarnate Himself, to us it is
   absolutely necessary if we wish to touch the hearts of those whom God
   sends to us. It is impossible perfectly to understand anything that
   experience has not taught us, by suffering or by action. This is the
   school of the Holy Spirit who in this way speaks life-giving words to
   the soul, and those which He speaks to us through others come from the
   same source.

   Reading and seeing become fruitful and possess virtue and light only by
   the acquisition of this divine science, otherwise they are like dough
   to which leaven is necessary, and the salt of experience to season it.
   And since without this salt, we have only vague ideas to act upon, we
   are like visionaries, who, though knowing the roads that lead to all
   the towns, yet lose their way going to their own house.

   We must listen to God from moment to moment to become learned in the
   theology of virtue which is entirely practical and experimental. Do not
   attend therefore to what is said to others, but listen to that which is
   said to you and for you; there will be enough to exercise your faith
   because this interior language of God exercises, purifies, and
   increases it by its very obscurity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IX.--The Will of God in the Present Moment is the Source of
    Sanctity.

   O, all you who thirst, learn that you have not far to go to find the
   fountain of living waters; it flows quite close to you in the present
   moment; therefore hasten to find it. Why, with the fountain so near, do
   you tire yourselves with running about after every little rill? These
   only increase your thirst by giving only a few drops, whereas the
   source is inexhaustible. If you desire to think, to write, and to speak
   like the Prophets, the Apostles, and the Saints, you must give yourself
   up, as they did, to the inspirations of God. O unknown Love! it seems
   as if Your wonders were finished and nothing remained but to copy Your
   ancient works, and to quote Your past discourses! And no one sees that
   Your inexhaustible activity is a source of new thoughts, of fresh
   sufferings and further actions: of new Patriarchs, Apostles, Prophets,
   and Saints who have no need to copy the lives and writings of the
   others, but only to live in perpetual abandonment to Your secret
   operations. We hear of nothing on all sides but "the first centuries,"
   "the time of the Saints." What a strange way of talking! Is not all
   time a succession of the effects of the divine operation, working at
   every instant, filling, sanctifying, and supernaturalising them all?
   Has there ever been an ancient method of abandonment to this operation
   which is now out of season? Had the Saints of the first ages any other
   secret than that of becoming from moment to moment whatever the divine
   power willed to make them? And will this power cease to pour forth its
   glory on the souls which abandon themselves to it without reserve.

   O Love eternal, adorable, ever fruitful, and ever marvellous! May the
   divine operation of my God be my book, my doctrine, my science. In it
   are my thoughts, my words, my actions, and my sufferings. Not by
   consulting Your former works shall I become what You would have me to
   be; but by receiving You in everything. By that ancient road, the only
   royal road, the road of our fathers shall I be enlightened, and shall
   speak as they spoke. It is thus that I, would imitate them all, quote
   them all, copy them all.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION X.--God Makes Known His Will Through Creatures.

   In the present moment are made manifest the name of God, and the coming
   of His Kingdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The present moment is the ambassador of God to declare His mandates.
   The heart listens and pronounces its "fiat." Thus the soul advances by
   all these things and flows out from its centre to its goal. It never
   stops but sails with every wind. Any and every direction leads equally
   to the shore of infinity. Everything is a help to it, and is, without
   exception, an instrument of sanctity. The one thing necessary can
   always be found for it in the present moment. It is no longer a choice
   between prayer and silence, seclusion and society, reading and writing,
   meditation and cessation of thought, flight from and seeking after
   spiritual consolations, abundance and dearth, feebleness and health,
   life and death, but it is all that each moment presents by the will of
   God. In this is despoilment, abnegation, renunciation of all things
   created, either in reality or affectively, in order to retain nothing
   of self, or for self, to be in all things submissive to the will of God
   and to please Him; making it our sole satisfaction to sustain the
   present moment as though there were nothing else to hope for in the
   world.

   If all that happens to a soul abandoned to God is all that is necessary
   for it, then we can understand that nothing can be wanting to it, and
   that it should never pity itself, for this would be a want of faith and
   living according to reason and the senses which are never satisfied, as
   they cannot perceive the sufficiency of grace possessed by the soul. To
   hallow the name of God, is according to the meaning of the holy
   Scripture, to recognise His sanctity in all things and to love and
   adore Him in them. Things, in fact, proceed from the mouth of God like
   words. That which God does at each moment is a divine thought expressed
   by a created thing, therefore all those things by which He intimates
   His will to us are so many names and words by which He makes known His
   wishes. His will is unity and has but one name, unknown, and ineffable;
   but it is infinitely diverse in its effects, which are, as it were, so
   many different characters which it assumes. To hallow the Name of God
   is to know, to adore, and to love the ineffable Being whom this name
   designates. It is also to know, to adore and to love His adorable will
   at every moment and in all its decrees, regarding them all as so many
   veils, shadows and names of this holy and everlasting will.

   It is holy in all its works, holy in all its words, holy in all its
   diverse characters, holy in all the names it bears.

   It was for this reason that Job blessed the name of God in his utter
   desolation. Instead of looking upon his condition as ruin, he called it
   the name of God and by blessing it he protested that the divine will
   under whatever name or form it might appear, even though expressed by
   the most terrible catastrophes, was holy. David also blessed it at all
   times, and in all places. It is then, by this continual recognition of
   the will of God as manifested and revealed in all things, that He
   reigns in us, that His will is done on earth as it is in Heaven, and
   that our souls obtain nourishment. The whole matter of that
   incomparable prayer prescribed by Jesus Christ is comprised and
   contained in abandonment to the divine will. Many times daily it is
   recited vocally by the command of God and of Holy Church, but we repeat
   it at every moment in the centre of our hearts when we love to do, or
   to suffer whatever this holy will ordains. That which takes time to
   repeat in words, the heart pronounces at every moment, and it is in
   this way that simple-minded souls are called to bless God. Nevertheless
   they cannot bless Him as much as they desire, and this inability is a
   subject of grief to them; so true is it that by the very means that
   seem like privations, God bestows graces and favours on faithful souls.
   To enrich the soul at the expense of the senses, filling it by so much
   the more as they experience the more terrible emptiness, is a secret of
   the divine wisdom.

   The events of every moment bear the impress of the will of God, and of
   His adorable Name. How holy is this name! It is right, therefore, to
   bless it, to treat it as a kind of sacrament which by its own virtue
   sanctifies those souls which place no obstacles in its way.

   Everything bearing the impress of this august Name should be held in
   the most profound veneration. It is a divine manna from Heaven, and
   imparts a constant increase of grace. It is the reign of holiness in
   the soul, the bread of angels eaten on earth as well as in Heaven. We
   can no longer consider our moments as trifles since in them is a whole
   kingdom of sanctity and food for angels.

   "Yes, Lord, may your kingdom come in my heart to sanctify it, to
   nourish it, to purify it, and to render it victorious over all its
   enemies. Moment most precious! How insignificant in the eyes of the
   vulgar, but how great in those enlightened by faith. If it is great
   also in the eyes of my Father who is in Heaven, how can I regard it as
   insignificant? All that comes from His hand is essentially good and
   bears the impress of its origin."
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION XI.--Everything is Supernaturalised by the Divine Action.

   The divine action incites souls to aim at the most eminent sanctity;
   all that is required on the part of the soul is abandonment to this
   action.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is only from want of knowing how to make use of the divine action
   that so many Christians pass their lives in anxiously pursuing a
   multitude of methods which might prove useful if ordained by this
   divine action, but which by preventing a simple union with it, become
   positively harmful. All this multiplicity fails to impart that which
   can only be found in the principle of all life, that which is
   continually present with us, and which stamps each of its tools with a
   character of its own and makes it work with an incomparable fitness.
   Jesus is sent to us as a Master to whom we do not sufficiently attend.
   He speaks to every heart, and to each He utters the word of life, the
   only word applicable to us, but we do not hear it. We want to know what
   He has said to others and do not listen when He speaks to ourselves. We
   do not sufficiently regard things as having been supernaturalised by
   the divine action. We should always accept them with the perfect
   confidence they merit; with an open mind and with generosity, and be
   sure that nothing will harm those who act thus. This vast activity,
   which is in itself ever the same from the beginning to the end of time,
   is employed with every moment, pouring its immensity and virtue on the
   souls which adore it, love it, and rejoice in it alone.

   You say you would be delighted to find an opportunity of dying for God,
   and would be completely satisfied with some such action, or with a life
   leading to the same result. To lose all, to die forsaken, to sacrifice
   your life for others, these are indeed charming ideas! But as for me,
   Lord, I glorify in all things the might of Your will in which I find
   all the happiness of martyrdom, austerities, and good works for others.
   Your will is enough, and I am content to live and to die as it decrees.
   In itself it is more pleasing to me than all the attributes of the
   instruments of which it makes use, or than their effects, because it
   pervades all, makes all divine, and changes all into itself. It is all
   heavenly to me, and every one of my moments is a genuine divine action,
   and living or dying I shall always be satisfied with it. Yes, divine
   Love, I shall no longer single out times or ways, but shall welcome You
   always and in any fashion. It seems to me, O divine Will, as if You had
   revealed Your immensity to me; I will therefore take no steps save in
   the bosom of Your infinity, You who are the same yesterday, to-day, and
   for ever. The unceasing torrent of graces has its rise in You. It is
   from You that it flows, is carried on, and made active. Therefore it is
   not within the narrow limits of a book, or the life of a saint, or in
   some sublime idea that I ought to seek You. These are but drops of that
   ocean which is poured out over every creature and in which they are all
   immersed. They are mere atoms that disappear in this deep abyss. I will
   no longer seek this action in the thoughts of spiritual persons. I will
   no longer beg my bread from door to door, nor pay court to creatures,
   but I will live as the child of an infinitely good, wise, and powerful
   father whom I desire to please, and to make happy. I wish to live
   according to my faith, and since the divine action is applied by every
   single thing and at every moment for my perfection, I will live on this
   immense fortune, this certain income, and in the most profitable
   manner.

   Is there any creature whose action can equal that of God? Why then
   should I go to creatures for help since all that happens to me is the
   work of His uncreated hand? Creatures are powerless, ignorant, and
   without affection and I should die of thirst rushing like this from one
   fountain to another, from one stream to another when there is a sea at
   hand, the waters of which encompass me on every side. All that happens
   to me therefore will be food for my nourishment, water for my
   cleansing, fire for my purification, and a channel of grace for all my
   needs. That which I might endeavour to find in other ways seeks me
   incessantly and gives itself to me through all creatures.

   O Love of God! how is it that all creatures do not know how freely you
   lavish Yourself and Your favours on them while they are seeking You in
   byways and corners where You are not to be found? How foolish to refuse
   to breathe the open air! to search for a spot on which to place the
   foot when there is the whole countryside before you; to be unable to
   find water when there is a whole deluge at your service, nor to possess
   and enjoy God, nor to recognise His action when it is present in all
   things. You search for hidden ways of belonging to God, good people,
   but the only way is that of making use of whatever He sends you. All
   leads to union, to perfection, except what is sinful or not a duty. All
   that is necessary is to accept everything, placing no obstacle in the
   way of its action but letting it accomplish its work. All things are
   intended to guide, raise, and support you, and are in the hand of God
   whose action is vaster and more present than the elements of earth,
   air, and water. Even by means of the senses God will enter, provided
   they are used only as He ordains, because everything contrary to His
   will must be resisted. There is not a single atom that goes to form
   part of your being, even to the marrow of the bones, that is not formed
   by the divine power. From it all things proceed, by it all things are
   made. Your very life-blood flows through your veins by the movement
   this power imparts to it, and all the fluctuations that exist between
   strength and weakness, languor and liveliness, life and death, are
   divine instruments put in motion to effect your sanctification. Under
   its influence all bodily states become operations of grace. From this
   invisible hand come all your opinions, all your ideas on whatever
   subject they may be formed. What this action will effect in you, you
   will learn by successive experiences, for there is no created heart or
   mind that can teach it to you. Your life flows on uninterruptedly in
   this unsounded abyss in which each present moment contains all that is
   best for you, and as such must be loved and esteemed. It is necessary
   to have a perfect confidence in this action which of itself can do
   nothing but what is good.

   Yes, divine Love! to what heights of supernatural, sublime, admirable
   and incomparable virtue would all souls arrive if they would but be
   satisfied with Your action!

   Yes, if they would leave the matter in this divine hand they would
   attain to an eminent degree of perfection! Everyone would arrive at it
   because it is offered to all. No effort is required because the work
   accomplishes itself. Every soul possesses in You an infinitely perfect
   model, and by your action which works ceaselessly to this end, is
   rendered like this model. If all souls were faithful copies of this
   divine example they would all speak, act, and live divinely. They would
   not require to copy each other, but would be singled out by the divine
   influence, and each would be rendered unique by the most simple and
   ordinary things.

   By what means, O my God, I can make your creatures appreciate what is
   offered to them? Must I who possess so great a treasure with which I
   could enrich the whole world, see souls perish in poverty? Must I
   behold them withering like plants in a desert when I can show them the
   source of living waters?

   Come, foolish souls, you who have not an atom of sensible devotion, you
   too who possess no talent nor even the rudiments of education, you who
   cannot understand a single spiritual term, who stand astonished at the
   eloquence of the learned whom you admire; come, and I will teach you a
   secret which will place you far beyond these clever minds. I will make
   perfection so easy to you that you will find it everywhere and in
   everything. I will unite you to God, and make you walk hand in hand
   with Him from the moment that you begin practising what I will teach
   you. Come, not to study the map of the spiritual country, but to
   possess it, to walk in it at your ease without fear of losing your way.
   Come, not to study the theory of divine grace, nor to find out what it
   has accomplished in the past and still continues to accomplish; but to
   become simply subject to its operations. It is not necessary that you
   should understand what it has said to others, nor to repeat the words
   intended only for them and which you have overheard, but you, yourself,
   will receive from it what is best for you.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION XII.--The Divine Word our Model.

   The divine action alone can sanctify us, for that alone can make us
   imitate the divine Example of our perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In course of time the idea formed by the Eternal Wisdom of all things
   is carried out by divine action. All things have, in God, their
   likeness, and are recognised and known by the divine Wisdom. Should you
   know all those things that are not for you, such knowledge would be no
   guide to you in any way. The divine action beholds in the Word the idea
   after which you ought to be formed and this example is always before
   it. It sees in the Word all that is necessary for the sanctification of
   every soul. The holy Scriptures contain one part, and the workings of
   the divine action in the interior of the soul, after the example set
   forth by the Word, complete the work. We must understand that the only
   way of receiving the impression of this eternal idea is to remain
   quietly amenable to it; and that neither efforts, nor mental
   speculations can do anything to that end. It is obvious that a work
   such as this cannot be effected by cleverness, intelligence, nor
   subtlety of mind, but only by the passive way of abandonment to, its
   reception, and by yielding to it like metal in a mould, or canvas under
   the pencil, or stone in the hands of the sculptor. It is evident that
   to know all the divine mysteries of God is by no means the way in which
   by His will we are made to resemble His image, that image which the
   Word has formed of us; that our resemblance to the divine type can only
   be formed in us by the impression of the seal of the divine action, and
   that this impression is not produced in the mind by ideas, but in the
   will by abandonment. The wisdom of the just soul consists in being
   content with what is intended for it! in confining itself within the
   boundary of its path, and not trespassing beyond its limit. It is not
   inquisitive about God's ways of acting, but is content as regards
   itself with the arrangements of His will, making no effort to discover
   its meaning by comparisons or conjectures, but only desiring to
   understand what each moment reveals. It listens to the voice of the
   Word when it sounds in the depths of the heart, it does not inquire as
   to what the divine Spouse has said to others, but is satisfied with
   what it receives for itself, so that moment by moment it becomes, in
   this way, divinised without its knowledge. It is thus that the divine
   Word converses with His spouse, by the solid effects of His action
   which the spouse without scrutinising curiously, accepts with loving
   gratitude. Thus the spirituality of such a soul is perfectly simple,
   absolutely solid, and thoroughly diffused throughout its entire being.
   Its actions are not determined by ideas nor by a confusion of words
   which by themselves would only serve to excite pride. Pious people make
   a great use of the mind, whereas mental exertion is of very little use,
   and is even antagonistic to true piety. We must make use only of that
   which God sends us to do or to suffer, and not forsake this divine
   reality to occupy our minds with the historical wonders of the divine
   work instead of gaining an increase of grace by our fidelity.

   The marvels of this work, of which we read for the purpose of
   satisfying our curiosity, often only tend to disgust us with things
   that seem trifling but by which, if we do not despise them, the divine
   love effects very great things in us. Fools that we are! We admire and
   bless this divine action in the writings relating its history, and when
   it is ready to continue this writing on our hearts, we keep moving the
   paper and prevent it writing by our curiosity, to see what it is doing
   in and around us. Pardon, divine love, these defects; I can see them
   all in myself, for I am not yet able to understand how to let You act.
   So far I have not allowed myself to be cast into the mould. I have run
   through all Your workshops and have admired all Your works, but have
   not as yet, by abandonment, received even the bare outlines of Your
   pencil. Nevertheless I have found in You a kind Master, a Physician, a
   Father, a beloved Friend.

   I will now become Your disciple, and will frequent no other school than
   Yours. Like the Prodigal Son I return hungering for Your bread. I
   relinquish the ideas which tend only to the satisfaction of mental
   curiosity; I will no longer run after masters and books but will only
   make use of them as of other things that present themselves, not for my
   own satisfaction, but in dependence on the divine action and in
   obedience to You. For love of You and to discharge my debts I will
   confine myself to the one essential business, that of the present
   moment, and thus enable You to act.

BOOK II

  ON THE STATE OF ABANDONMENT.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    ON THE NATURE AND EXCELLENCE OF THE STATE OF ABANDONMENT.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--The life of God in the soul.

   There is a time when the soul lives in God, and a time when God lives
   in the soul. What is appropriate to one state is inconsistent with the
   other. When God lives in the soul it ought to abandon itself entirely
   to His providence. When the soul lives in God it is obliged to procure
   for itself carefully and very regularly, every means it can devise by
   which to arrive at the divine union. The whole procedure is marked out;
   the readings, the examinations, the resolutions. The guide is always at
   hand and everything is by rule, even the hours for conversation. When
   God lives in the soul it has nothing left of self, but only that which
   the spirit which actuates it imparts to it at each moment. Nothing is
   provided for the future, no road is marked out, but it is like a child
   which can be led wherever one pleases, and has only feeling to
   distinguish what is presented to it. No more books with marked passages
   for such a soul; often enough it is even deprived of a regular
   director, for God allows it no other support than that which He gives
   it Himself. Its dwelling is in darkness, forgetfulness, abandonment,
   death and nothingness. It feels keenly its wants and miseries without
   knowing from whence or when will come its relief. With eyes fixed on
   Heaven it waits peacefully and without anxiety for someone to come to
   its assistance. God, who finds no purer disposition in His spouse than
   this entire self-renunciation for the sake of living the life of grace
   according to the divine operation, provides her with necessary books,
   thoughts, insight into her own soul, advice and counsel, and the
   examples of the wise. Everything that others discover with great
   difficulty this soul finds in abandonment, and what they guard with
   care in order to be able to find it again, this soul receives at the
   moment there is occasion for it, and afterwards relinquishes so as to
   admit nothing but exactly what God desires it to have in order to live
   by Him alone. The former soul undertakes an infinity of good works for
   the glory of God, the latter is often cast aside in a corner of the
   world like a bit of broken crockery, apparently of no use to anyone.
   There, this soul, forsaken by creatures but in the enjoyment of God by
   a very real, true, and active love (active although infused in repose),
   does not attempt anything by its own impulse; it only knows that it has
   to abandon itself and to remain in the hands of God to be used by Him
   as He pleases. Often it is ignorant of its use, but God knows well. The
   world thinks it is useless, and appearances give colour to this
   judgment, but nevertheless it is very certain that in mysterious ways
   and by unknown channels, it spreads abroad an infinite amount of grace
   on persons who often have no idea of it, and of whom it never thinks.
   In souls abandoned to God everything is efficacious, everything is a
   sermon and apostolic. God imparts to their silence, to their repose, to
   their detachment, to their words, gestures, etc., a certain virtue
   which, unknown to them, works in the hearts of those around them; and,
   as they are guided by the occasional actions of others who are made use
   of by grace to instruct them without their knowledge, in the same way,
   they, in their turn, are made use of for the support and guidance of
   others without any direct acquaintance with them, or understanding to
   that effect.

   God it is who works in them, by unexpected and often unknown impulses;
   so that these souls are like to Jesus, from whom proceeded a secret
   virtue for the healing of others. There is this difference between Him
   and them, that often they do not perceive the outflow of this virtue
   and even contribute nothing by co-operation: it is like a hidden balm,
   the perfume of which is exhaled without being recognised, and which
   knows not its own virtue.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--The most perfect way.

   In this state the soul is guided by the divine action through every
   kind of obscurity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When the soul is moved by the divine influence, it forsakes all works,
   practices, methods, means, books, ideas, and spiritual persons in order
   to be guided by God alone by abandoning itself to that moving power
   which becomes the sole source of its perfection. It remains in His
   hands like all the saints, understanding that the divine action alone
   can guide it in the right path, and that if it were to seek other means
   it would inevitably go astray in that unknown country which God compels
   it to traverse. It is, therefore, the action of God which guides and
   conducts souls by ways which it alone understands. It is, with these
   souls, like the changes of the wind. The direction is only known in the
   present moment, and the effects follow their causes by the will of God,
   which is only explained by these effects because it acts in these souls
   and makes them act either by hidden undoubted instincts, or by the
   duties of their state. This is all the spirituality they know; these
   are their visions and revelations, this is the whole of their wisdom
   and counsel insomuch that nothing is ever wanting to them. Faith makes
   them certain that what they do is well, whether they read, speak, or
   write; and if they take counsel it is only to be able to distinguish
   more clearly the divine action. All this is laid down for them and they
   receive it like the rest, beholding beneath these things the divine
   motive power and not fastening on the things presented, but using or
   leaving them, always leaning by faith on the infallible, unruffled,
   immutable and ever efficacious action of God at each moment. This they
   perceive and enjoy in all things, the least as well as the greatest,
   for it is entirely at their service at every moment. Thus they make use
   of things not because they have any confidence in them, or for their
   own sake, but in submission to the divine ordinance, and to that
   interior operation which, even under contrary appearances, they
   discover with equal facility and certitude. Their life, therefore, is
   spent, not in investigations or desires, weariness or sighs, but in a
   settled assurance of being in the most perfect way.

   Every state of body or soul, and whatever happens interiorly or
   exteriorly as revealed at each moment to these souls is, to them, the
   fulness of the divine action, and the fulness of their joy. Created
   things are, to them, nothing but misery and dearth; the only true and
   just measure is in the working of the divine action. Thus, if it take
   away thoughts, words, books, food, persons, health, even life itself,
   it is exactly the same as if it did the contrary. The soul loves the
   divine action and finds it equally sanctifying under whatever shape it
   presents itself. It does not reason about the way it acts; it suffices
   for its approval that whatever comes is from this source.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--Abandonment a Pledge of Predestination.

   The state of abandonment contains in itself pure faith, hope, and
   charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The state of abandonment is a certain mixture of faith, hope, and
   charity in one single act, which unites the soul to God and to His
   action. United, these three virtues together form but one in a single
   act, the raising of the heart to God, and abandonment to His action.
   But how can this divine mingling, this spiritual oneness be explained?
   How can a name be found to convey an idea of its nature, and to make
   the unity of this trinity intelligible? It can be explained thus. It is
   only by means of these three virtues that the possession and enjoyment
   of God and of His will can be attained. This adorable object is seen,
   is loved, and all things are hoped for from it. Either virtue can with
   equal justice be called pure love, pure hope, or pure faith, and if the
   state of which we are speaking is more frequently designated by the
   last name, it is not that the other theological virtues are excluded,
   but rather that they may be understood to subsist and to be practised
   in this state in obscurity.

   There can be nothing more secure than this state in the things that are
   of God; nothing more disinterested than the character of the heart. On
   the side of God is the absolute certitude of faith, and on that of the
   heart is the same certitude tempered with fear and hope. O most
   desirable unity of the trinity of these holy virtues! Believe then,
   hope and love, but by a simple feeling which the Holy Spirit who is
   given you by God will produce in your soul. It is there that the
   unction of the name of God is diffused by the Holy Spirit in the centre
   of the heart. This is the word, this is the mystical revelation, and a
   pledge of predestination with all its happy results. "Quam bonus Israel
   Deus his qui recto sunt corde" (Psalm 72, i). This impress of the Holy
   Spirit in souls inflamed with His love, is called pure love on account
   of the torrent of delight overflowing every faculty, accompanied by a
   fulness of confidence and light; but in souls that are plunged in
   bitterness it is called pure faith because the darkness and obscurity
   of night are without alleviation. Pure love sees, feels, and believes.
   Pure faith believes without either seeing or feeling. In this is shown
   the difference between these two states, but this difference is only
   apparent, not real. The appearances are dissimilar, but in reality as
   the state of pure faith is not lacking in charity, neither is the state
   of pure love lacking in faith nor in abandonment; the terms being
   applied according to which virtue prevails. The different gradations of
   these virtues under the touch of the Holy Spirit form the variety of
   all supernatural and lofty states. And since God can rearrange them in
   an endless variety there is not a single soul that does not receive
   this priceless impress in a character suitable to it. The difference is
   nothing, there are the same faith, hope, and charity in all.
   Abandonment is a general means of receiving special virtues in every
   variety of different impresses. Souls cannot all lay claim to the same
   sort, nor to a similar state but all can be united to God, all can be
   abandoned to His action, all can receive the impress that is best
   suited to them, all in fact can live under the reign of God and enjoy a
   share in His justice with all its advantages. In this kingdom every
   soul can aspire to a crown, and whether a crown of love, or a crown of
   faith, it is always a crown, always the kingdom of God. There is this
   difference, it is true--the one is in light, the other in darkness; but
   again what does this signify if the soul belongs to God and obeys His
   will? We do not seek to know the name of this state, its
   characteristics, nor excellence, but we seek God alone and His action.
   The manner of it ought to be a matter of indifference to the soul. Let
   us therefore no longer preach to souls about either the state of pure
   love, or of perfect faith, the way of delights, or of the Cross, for
   these cannot be imparted to all in the same degree nor in the same
   manner; but let us preach abandonment in general to the divine action,
   to all simple souls who fear God, and let us make them all understand
   that by these means they will attain to that particular state chosen
   and destined for them by the divine action from all eternity. Let us
   not dishearten, nor rebuff, nor drive away anyone from that most
   eminent perfection to which Jesus calls everyone, exacting from them
   submission to the will of His heavenly Father and thus making them
   members of His mystical body. He is their head only in so far as their
   will is in accordance with His. Let us continually repeat to all souls
   that the invitation of this sweet and loving Saviour does not exact
   anything very difficult from them, nor very extraordinary. He does not
   ask for talent and ingenuity, all He desires is that they have a good
   will and desire to be united to Him so that He could guide, direct and
   befriend them in proportion as they are so united.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--Abandonment a Source of Joy.

   The state of abandonment comprises the most heroic generosity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is nothing more generous than the way in which a soul having
   faith, accepts the most deadly perils and troubles, beholding in them
   something divine of the spiritual life. When it is a question of
   swallowing poison, of filling a breach, of slaving for the
   plague-stricken; in all this they find a plenitude of divine life, not
   given to them drop by drop, but in floods which inundate and engulf the
   soul in an instant.

   If an army were animated by the same ideals it would be invincible.
   This is because the instinct of faith is an elevation and enlargement
   of the heart above and beyond all that is presented to the senses.

   The life of faith, and the instinct of faith are one and the same. It
   is an enjoyment of the goods of God, and a confidence founded on the
   expectation of His protection, making everything pleasant and received
   with a good grace. It is indifference to, and at the same time a
   preparation for every place, state, or person. Faith is never unhappy
   even when the senses are most desolate. This lively faith is always in
   God, always in His action above contrary appearances by which the
   senses are darkened. The senses, in terror, suddenly cry to the soul,
   "Unhappy one! You have now no resource, you are lost," and instantly
   faith with a stronger voice answers: "Keep firm, go on, and fear
   nothing."
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION V.--The Great Merit of Pure Faith.

   By the state of abandonment and of pure faith the soul gains more merit
   than by the most eminent good works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Whatever we find extraordinary in the lives of the saints, such as
   revelations, visions and interior locutions, is but a glimpse of that
   excellence of their state which is contained and hidden in the exercise
   of faith; because faith possesses all this by knowing how to see and
   hear God in that which happens from moment to moment. When these
   favours are manifested visibly it does not mean that by faith they have
   not been already possessed, but in order to make the excellence of
   faith visible for the purpose of attracting souls to the practice of
   it; just as the glory of Thabor, and the miracles of Jesus Christ were
   not from any increase of His intrinsic excellence, but from the light
   which from time to time escaped from the dark cloud of His humanity to
   make it an object of veneration and love to others.

   That which is wonderful in the saints is the constancy of their faith
   under every circumstance; without this there would be no sanctity. In
   the loving faith which makes them rejoice in God for everything, their
   sanctity has no need of any extraordinary manifestation; this could
   only prove useful to others who might require the testimony of such
   signs; but the soul in this state, happy in its obscurity, does in no
   way rely on these brilliant manifestations; it allows them to show
   outwardly for the profit of others, but keeps for itself what all have
   in common, the will of God, and His good pleasure. Its faith is proved
   in hiding, and not in manifesting itself, and those who require more
   proof have less faith.

   Those who live by faith receive proofs, not as such, but as favours
   from the hand of God, and in this sense things that are extraordinary
   are not in contradiction to the state of pure faith.

   But there are many saints whom God sets up for the salvation of souls,
   and from whose faces He causes rays of glory to stream for the
   enlightenment of the most blind. Of such were the Prophets and the
   Apostles and all those saints chosen by God to be set in the
   candlestick of the Church. There will ever be such, as there ever have
   been.

   There is also an infinity of others who, having been created to shine
   in the heavens give no light in this world, but live and die in
   profound obscurity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VI.--Submission a Free Gift to God.

   The state of abandonment includes the merit of every separate
   operation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Abandonment as practised interiorly contains every possible variety of
   operation, because, the soul giving itself up to the good pleasure of
   God, this surrender, effected by pure love, extends to all the
   operations of this good pleasure. Thus the soul practises at each
   moment an abandonment without limit, and in its virtue are comprehended
   all possible qualities and every method. It is, therefore, by no means
   the business of the soul to decide what is the object of the submission
   it owes to God; its sole occupation is to submit at all times and for
   all things.

   What God requires of the soul is the essential part of abandonment. The
   free gifts He asks are abnegation, obedience, and love, the rest is His
   business. Provided that the soul carefully fulfils the duties of its
   state; provided it quietly follows the attraction given to it, and
   submits peacefully to the dealings of grace as to body and soul, it is
   in this way exercising interiorly one general and universal act, that
   of abandonment. This act is by no means limited by time, nor by the
   special duty of the moment, but possesses in the main all the merit and
   efficacy which a sincere good will always has, although the result does
   not depend upon it. What it desired to do is done, in the sight of God.

   If God's good pleasure sets a limit to the exercise of particular
   faculties, it sets none to that of the will. The good pleasures of God,
   the being and essence of God are the objects of the will, and by the
   exercise of charity its union with God has neither limit, distinction,
   nor measure. If this charity ends in the exercise of the faculties for
   certain objects, it is because the will of God only goes so far; it
   contracts itself, so to speak, restricting itself to the exigencies of
   the present moment from whence it passes to the faculties, and then to
   the heart. Finding the heart pure, free, and without reserve, it
   communicates itself fully to it on account of the infinite capacity
   which charity has effected, by emptying it of all created things, thus
   rendering it capable of union with God. O heavenly purity! O blessed
   annihilation! O unreserved submission! through you is God drawn into
   the centre of the heart. Let the faculties then be what they will,
   provided, Lord, that I possess You. Do what You will with this
   insignificant creature; whether it works, becomes inspired, or becomes
   the subject of Your impressions, it is all one. All is yours, all is
   from You and for You. I have no longer anything to look after, anything
   to do. I have no hand in the arrangement of one single moment of my
   life, all is Yours. I ought neither to add to, nor to diminish
   anything, neither to seek after, nor to reflect upon, anything. It is
   for You to regulate everything. Direction, mortification, sanctity,
   perfection, and salvation are all Your business, Lord; mine is to be
   satisfied with Your work, and not to appropriate any action, or any
   state, but to leave all to Your good pleasure.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VII.--Submission a Free Gift to God.

   Every soul is called to enjoy the infinite benefits contained in this
   state.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Therefore do I preach abandonment, and not any particular state. Every
   state in which souls are placed by Your grace is the same to me. I
   teach a general method by which all can attain the state which You have
   marked out for them. I do not exact more than the will to abandon
   themselves to Your guidance. You will make them arrive infallibly at
   the state which is best for them.

   It is faith that I preach; abandonment, confidence, and faith; the will
   to be subject to, and to be the tool of the divine action, and to
   believe that at every moment this action is working in every
   circumstance, provided that the soul has more or less good-will. This
   is the faith that I preach. It is not a special kind of faith, nor of
   charity, but a general state by which all souls can find God under the
   different conditions which He assumes; and can take that form which
   divine grace has marked out for them. I have spoken to souls in
   trouble, and now I am speaking to all kinds of souls. It is the genuine
   instinct of my heart to care for all, to announce the saving secret far
   and wide, and to make myself all to all. In this happy disposition I
   make it a duty which I fulfil without difficulty, to weep with those
   who weep, to rejoice with those who rejoice, to speak foolishly with
   the foolish, and with the learned to make use of more learned and more
   scholastic terms. I wish to make all understand that although they
   cannot aspire to the same distinct favours, they can attain to the same
   love, the same abnegation, the same God and His work, and thence it
   follows naturally, to the highest sanctity. Those graces which are
   called extraordinary and are given as privileges to certain souls, are
   only so called because there are so few sufficiently faithful to become
   worthy of receiving them. This will be made manifest at the day of
   judgment. Alas! it will then be seen that instead of these divine
   favours having been withheld by God, it has been entirely by their own
   fault that these souls have been deprived of them. What untold
   blessings they would have received through the complete submission of a
   steadfast goodwill.

   It is the same with regard to Jesus as with the divine action. If those
   who have no confidence in Him, nor respect for Him, do not receive any
   of the favours He offers to all, they have only their own bad
   disposition to thank for it. It is true that all cannot aspire to the
   same sublime states, to the same gifts, to the same degree of
   perfection; yet, if faithful to grace, they corresponded to it, each
   according to his degree, they would all be satisfied because they would
   all attain that degree of grace and of perfection which would fully
   satisfy their desires. They would be happy according to nature, and
   according to grace, because nature and grace share equally in the
   ardent desire for this priceless advantage.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VIII.--God Reigns in a Pure Heart.

   All the treasures of grace are the fruit of purity of heart and perfect
   abandonment.

   He, therefore, who wishes to enjoy an abundance of all blessings had
   but one thing to do; to purify his heart by detaching it from
   creatures, and to abandon himself entirely to God. In this purity and
   abandonment he will find all that he desires. "May others, Lord, ask
   You for all sorts of gifts, may they multiply their words and prayers;
   as for me, my God, I only ask one single gift, I have only one prayer
   to make--give me a pure heart." O pure heart! how happy you are; for by
   the liveliness of your faith you see God as He is in Himself. You see
   Him in all things and at every moment working within you and around
   you. In all things you are His subject and His instrument. He rules you
   and leads you. You have not to think because He thinks for you.
   Whatever happens to you, or may happen by His will, it is enough for
   Him that you will it also. He understands your readiness. In your
   salutary blindness you try to discover in yourself this desire, but you
   cannot see it, nevertheless He sees it quite clearly. How foolish you
   are! a well-disposed heart is a heart in which God dwells. Seeing
   therefore the good inclinations in this heart God well knows that it
   will remain always submissive to His will; He knows also that you are
   ignorant of what would be useful to you and therefore He makes it His
   business to give you what is necessary.

   It matters very little to Him whether you are thwarted or not. You
   imagine you are going East, He makes you go West. You are about to
   strike against a rock, He pushes the tiller and brings you into port.
   Without either map or a compass, wind or tide, the voyages you make are
   always fortunate. If you encounter pirates, an unexpected puff of wind
   instantly wafts you beyond their reach.

   O good will! O pure heart! Jesus well knew where to place you when He
   ranked you among the Beatitudes. What greater happiness can there be
   than to possess God, if He mutually possesses you? It is a state full
   of charm and of joy, in which the soul reposes peacefully in the bosom
   of divine Providence where it sports innocently with the divine Wisdom,
   feeling no anxiety about the journey which suffers no interruption, but
   in spite of rocks and pirates and constant storms, ever continues as
   happy as possible.

   O pure heart! O good will! the sole foundation of every spiritual
   state, to you are granted the gifts of firm faith, holy hope, perfect
   confidence and pure love, and by you are they made profitable.

   On your stem are grafted the flowers of the desert; in other words,
   from you spring those priceless graces which blossom in souls entirely
   detached, where God, as in an uninhabited dwelling, takes up His abode
   to the exclusion of all else. You are the faithful source from whence
   flow those streams that water the flower garden of the divine Spouse,
   and of His chosen one. Your voice calls all the souls of men saying to
   them, "Look well at me; it is I who impart fair love, that love which
   chooses the better part and lays hold of it. It is I who give birth to
   that fear, so gentle and efficacious, which produces a horror of evil,
   and makes it easy to avoid; I, who bring to light those fine
   perceptions by which are discovered the greatness of God and the value
   of virtue; in fine it is from me that those ardent desires take their
   rise, enkindled by holy hope. It is I who cause virtue to be practised
   in expectation of the promised reward--that divine Object of our love,
   the possession of Whom will one day form the happiness of faithful
   souls. Invite them all to come to you to be enriched with your
   inexhaustible treasures. All spiritual states and paths lead back to
   you. It is from you that they derive all that is beautiful, attractive,
   and charming, for all is drawn from your depths. Those marvellous
   fruits of grace, and of every kind of virtue that helps to nourish the
   soul, and that abounds on every side, are produced by you. Milk and
   honey flow in your land. Your breasts distil milk, and on your bosom is
   the bouquet of myrrh from which, under the pressure of your fingers,
   the aromatic liquid flows abundantly.

   Let us go, then, let us run and fly to that ocean of love by which we
   are attracted! What are we waiting for? Let us start at once, let us
   lose ourselves in God, even in His heart, to become inebriated with the
   wine of His charity. We shall find in His heart the key of heavenly
   treasures. Let us begin at once our journey to Heaven. There is no
   passage that we cannot discover, nothing is shut against us, neither
   the garden, nor the cellar, nor the vineyard. If we desire to breathe
   the fresh country air, we can go on our own feet and return when we
   please. With this key of David we can enter and depart; it is the key
   of science, and of that abyss in which are contained all the hidden
   treasures of divine Wisdom. With this heavenly key we also open the
   gates of mystical death with its sacred darkness. By it also we descend
   into the deep pools and into the den of lions. By it souls are thrust
   into those obscure prisons from whence they emerge unscathed. By it we
   are introduced into that joyful place where light and understanding
   have their dwelling, where the Spouse takes the midday rest in the open
   air, and where He reveals the secrets of His love to faithful souls. O
   divine incommunicable secrets that no mortal tongue can describe! Since
   every good thing that it is possible to possess is given to those who
   love, let us love then, in order to be enriched with them; for love
   produces sanctity with all that accompanies it. It flows on every side,
   on the right hand and on the left, into those hearts open to receive
   this divine outpouring. O divine harvest for eternity! it is not
   possible to praise you sufficiently. And why speak so much about you?
   How much better to possess you in silence than to praise you with mere
   words. But what am I saying? You must be praised but only because you
   take possession of us, for, from the moment you enter into possession
   of a heart, then reading, writing, speaking or silence are matters of
   complete indifference. One can take or leave anything, live in
   solitude, or as an apostle; one is well or ill, dull or eloquent, in
   fact anything that you will. That which you dictate, your faithful
   echo, the heart, repeats to all the faculties. In that compound of
   matter and spirit, the heart, which you regard as your kingdom, you
   reign supreme, and as it has no other instincts than those which you
   inspire, all the things that you present are equally agreeable. Those
   things that nature, or the devil wish to substitute, cause nothing but
   disgust and horror. If you allow it to be occasionally overcome, it is
   only to make it wiser and more humble; but from the moment it realises
   its mistake it returns to you with renewed love, and clings to you with
   greater tenacity.

  CHAPTER II.

    THE DUTIES OF THOSE SOULS CALLED BY GOD TO THE STATE OF ABANDONMENT.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--Sacrifice, the Foundation of Sanctity.

   The first great duty of souls called by God to this state is the
   absolute and entire surrender of themselves to Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Sacrificate sacrificium, et sperate in Domino." That is to say that
   the great and solid foundation of the spiritual life is the sacrifice
   of oneself to God, subjecting oneself to His good pleasure in all
   things, both interior and exterior, and becoming so completely
   forgetful of self thereafter as to regard oneself as a chattel, sold
   and delivered, to which one no longer has any right. In this way the
   good pleasure of God forms one's whole felicity; and His happiness,
   glory and existence one's sole good. This foundation laid, the soul has
   nothing else to do but to rejoice that God is God, and to abandon
   itself so entirely to His good pleasure that it feels an equal
   satisfaction in whatever it does, nor ever reflects on the uses to
   which it is applied by the arrangements of this good pleasure. To
   abandon oneself, therefore, is the principal duty to be fulfilled,
   involving, as it does, the faithful discharge of all the obligations of
   one's state. The perfection with which these duties are accomplished
   will be the measure of the sanctity of each individual soul. A saintly
   soul is a soul freely submissive, with the help of grace, to the divine
   will. All that follows on this free consent is the work of God, and not
   of man. The soul should blindly abandon itself and be indifferent about
   everything. This is all that God requires of it, and as to the rest He
   determines and chooses according to His own plans, as an architect
   selects and arranges the stones for the building he is about to
   construct. It is therefore of the first importance to love God and His
   will, and to love this will in whatever way it is made manifest to us,
   without desiring anything else. The soul has no concern in the choice
   of different objects, that is God's affair, and whatever He gives is
   best for the soul. The whole of spirituality is an abridgment of this
   maxim, "Abandon yourself entirely to the over-ruling of God, and by
   self-oblivion be eternally occupied in loving and serving Him without
   any of those fears, reflexions, examens, and anxieties which the affair
   of our salvation, and perfection sometimes occasion." Since God wishes
   to do all for us, let us place everything in His hands once and for
   all, leaving them to His infinite wisdom; and trouble no more about
   anything but what concerns Him. On then, my soul, on with head uplifted
   above earthly things, always satisfied with God, with everything He
   does, or makes you do. Take good care not to imprudently entertain a
   crowd of anxious reflexions which, like so many trackless ways, carry
   our footsteps far and wide until we are hopelessly astray. Let us go
   through that labyrinth of self-love by leaping over it, instead of
   traversing its interminable windings.

   On, my soul, through despondency, illness, aridity, uncertain tempers,
   weakness of disposition, snares of the devil and of men; through
   suspicions, jealousies, evil imaginations and prejudices. Let us soar
   like the eagle above all these clouds with eyes always fixed on the
   sun, and on its ways, which represent our obligations. All this we must
   needs feel, but we must, at the same time, remember that ours is not a
   life of mere sentiment, and that it does not depend upon us either to
   feel, or to be callous. Let us live in the higher regions of the soul
   in which God and His will form an eternity ever equal, ever the same,
   ever unchanging. In this dwelling entirely spiritual, wherein the
   uncreated, immeasurable and ineffable holds the soul at an infinite
   distance from all that is specific in shadows and created atoms, it
   remains calm, even when the senses are tossed about by tempests. It has
   become independent of the senses; their troubles and agitations and
   innumerable vicissitudes no more affect it, than the clouds that
   obscure the sky for a moment and then fade away, affect the sun. We
   know that all passes away like clouds blown along by the wind, and
   nothing is consecutive nor ordered, but everything is in a state of
   perpetual change. In the state of faith, as in that of glory, God and
   His will is the eternal object that captivates the heart, and will one
   day form its true happiness, and this glorious state of the soul will
   influence the material part which at present is the prey of monsters
   and savage beasts. Beneath these appearances, terrible though they be,
   the divine action will so work on this material part as to make it
   partake of a heavenly power which will render it brilliant as the sun;
   for the faculties of the sensitive soul, and those of the body are
   prepared here below like gold or iron, or like canvas for a picture, or
   stones for a building. Like the matter of which these different
   materials are composed they will not attain their brilliance and purity
   of form until they have passed through many alterations, have endured
   many deprivations, and survived many destructions. Whatever they suffer
   here below under the hand of God serves to that end.

   The soul, in the state of faith, which knows the secret of God, dwells
   always in peace. All that takes place interiorly, instead of alarming,
   reassures it. Deeply convinced that it is guided by God, it takes all
   that happens as so much grace, and overlooking the instrument with
   which God works, it thinks only of the work that He is doing.

   It is actuated by love to fulfil faithfully and exactly all its duties.
   All that is distinct in a soul abandoned to God, is the work of grace,
   with the exception of those defects which are slight, and which the
   action of grace even turns to good account. I call that distinct of
   which a soul receives a sensible impression either of sorrow or
   consolation through those things applied to it unceasingly by the
   divine will for its improvement. I call it distinct because it is more
   clearly distinguished by the soul from all else that takes place within
   it. In all these things faith sees only God, and applies itself solely
   to become conformed to His will.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--The Pains and Consolations of Abandonment.

   The soul ought to strip itself of all things created in order to arrive
   at the state of abandonment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This state is full of consolation for those who have attained it; but
   to do so it is necessary to pass through much anguish. The doctrine
   concerning pure love can only be taught by the action of God, and not
   by any effort of the mind. God teaches the soul by pains and obstacles,
   not by ideas.

   This science is a practical knowledge by which God is enjoyed as the
   only good. In order to master this science it is necessary to be
   detached from all personal possessions, to gain this detachment, to be
   really deprived of them. Therefore it is only by constant crosses, and
   by a long succession of all kinds of mortifications, trials, and
   deprivations, that pure love becomes established in the soul. This must
   continue until all things created become as though they did not exist,
   and God becomes all in all. To effect this God combats all the personal
   affections of the soul, so that when these take any especial shape,
   such as some pious notion, some help to devotion; or when there is any
   idea of being able to attain perfection by some such method, or such a
   path or way, or by the guidance of some particular person; in fine to
   whatever the soul attaches itself, God upsets its plans, and allows it
   to find, instead of success in these projects, nothing but confusion,
   trouble, emptiness, and folly. Hardly has it said "I must go this way,
   I must consult this person, or, I must act in such a manner," than God
   immediately says the exact contrary, and withdraws all the virtue usual
   in the means adopted by the soul. Thus, finding only deception and
   emptiness in everything, the soul is compelled to have recourse to God
   Himself, and to be content with Him.

   Happy the soul that understands this lovingly severe conduct of God,
   and that corresponds faithfully with it. It is raised above all that
   passes away to repose in the immutable and the infinite. It is no
   longer dissipated among created things by giving them love and
   confidence, but allows them only when it becomes a duty to do so, or
   when enjoined by God, and when His will is made especially manifest in
   the matter. It inhabits a region above earthly abundance or dearth, in
   the fulness of God who is its permanent good. God finds this soul quite
   empty of its own inclinations, of its own movements, of its own choice.
   It is a dead subject, and shrouded in universal indifference. The whole
   of the divine Being, coming thus to fill the heart, casts over all
   created things a shadow, as of nothingness, absorbing all their
   distinctions and all their varieties. Thus there remains neither
   efficacy, nor virtue in anything created, and the heart is neither
   drawn towards, nor has any inclination for created things, because the
   majesty of God fills it to its utmost extent. Living in God in this
   way, the heart becomes dead to all else, and all is dead to it. It is
   for God, who gives life to all things, to revive the soul with regard
   to His creation, and to give a different aspect to all things in the
   eyes of the soul. It is the order of God which is this life. By this
   order the heart goes out towards the creature as far as is necessary or
   useful, and it is also by this order that the creature is carried
   towards the soul and is accepted by it. Without this divine virtue of
   the good pleasure of God, things created are not admitted by the soul;
   neither is the soul at all inclined towards them. This dissolution of
   all things as far as the soul is concerned, and then, by the will of
   God, their being brought once more into existence, compels the soul at
   each moment to see God in all things, for each moment is spent for the
   satisfaction of God only, and in an unreserved self-abandonment with
   regard to its relations to all possible created things, or rather to
   those created, or possibly to be created by the order of God. Therefore
   each moment contains all.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--The Different Duties of Abandonment.

   The active exercise of abandonment either in relation to precept, or to
   inspiration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Although souls called by God to a state of abandonment are much more
   passive than active, yet they cannot expect to be exempted from all
   activity. This state being nothing else but the virtue of abandonment
   exercised more habitually, and with greater perfection, should, like
   this virtue, be composed of two kinds of duty; the active
   accomplishment of the divine will, and the passive acceptance of all
   that this will pleases to send.

   It consists essentially, as we have already said, in the gift of our
   whole self to God to be used as He thinks fit. Well! the good pleasure
   of God makes use of us in two ways; either it compels us to perform
   certain actions, or it simply works within us. We, therefore, submit
   also in two ways; either by the faithful accomplishment of its clearly
   defined orders, or else by a simple and passive submission to its
   impressions of either pleasure or pain. Abandonment implies all this,
   being nothing else but a perfect submission to the order of God as made
   manifest at the present moment: It matters little to the soul in what
   manner it is obliged to abandon itself, and what the present moment
   contains; all that is absolutely necessary is that it should abandon
   itself unreservedly. There are, then, prescribed duties to be
   fulfilled, and necessary duties to be accepted, and further there is a
   third kind which also forms part of active fidelity, although it does
   not properly belong to works of precept. In this are comprised inspired
   duties; those to which the spirit of God inclines the hearts that are
   submissive to Him. The accomplishment of this kind of duty, requires a
   great simplicity, a gentle and cheerful heartiness, a soul easily moved
   by every breath of directing grace; for there is nothing else to do but
   to give oneself up, and to obey its inspirations simply and freely. So
   that souls may not be deceived, God never fails to give them wise
   guidance to indicate with what liberty or reserve these inspirations
   should be made use of. The third kind of duty takes precedence of all
   law, formalities, or marked-out rules. It is what, in saints, appears
   singular and extraordinary; it is what regulates their vocal prayer,
   interior words, the perception of their faculties, and also all that
   makes their lives noble, such as austerities, zeal, and the prodigality
   of their self-devotion for others. As all this belongs to the interior
   rule of the Holy Spirit, no one ought to try to obtain it, to imagine
   that they have it, to desire it, nor to regret that they do not possess
   the grace to undertake this kind of work, and to practise these
   uncommon virtues, because they are only really meritorious when
   practised according to the direction of God. If one is not content with
   this reserve one lays oneself open to the influence of one's own ideas,
   and will become exposed to illusion.

   It is necessary to remark that there are souls that God keeps hidden
   and little in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Far from
   giving them striking qualities, His design for them is that they should
   remain in obscurity. They would be deceived if they desired to attempt
   a different way. If they are well instructed they will recognise that
   fidelity to their nothingness is their right path, and they will find
   peace in their lowliness. The only difference, therefore, in their way
   and that of, apparently, more favoured souls, is the difference they
   make for themselves by the amount of their love and submission to the
   will of God; for, if they surpass in these virtues the souls that
   appear to work more than they exteriorly, their sanctity is, without
   doubt, so much the greater. This shows that each soul ought to content
   itself with the duties of its state, and the over-ruling of Providence;
   clearly God exacts this equally from all. As to attraction and the
   impressions received by the soul, these are given by God alone to whom
   He pleases. One must not try to produce them oneself, nor to make
   efforts to increase them. Natural effort is in direct opposition and
   quite contrary to infused inspirations, which should come in peace. The
   voice of the divine Spouse will awaken the soul, which should only
   proceed according to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit, for, if it
   were to act according to its own ideas it would make no progress.

   Therefore, if it should feel neither attraction nor grace to do those
   things that make the saints so much admired, it must, in justice to
   itself, say, "God has willed it thus for the saints, but not for me."
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--God Does All for a Soul of Goodwill.

   The conduct of a soul raised to a state of abandonment with regard to
   this twofold manifestation of the good pleasure of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Souls called by God to a life of perfect abandonment resemble in this
   respect our Lord, His holy Mother, and St. Joseph. The will of God was,
   to them, the fulness of life. Submitting entirely to this will as to
   precept and inspiration directly it was made manifest to them, they
   were always in complete dependence on, what we might call, the purely
   providential will of God; From this it follows that their lives,
   although extraordinary in perfection, showed outwardly nothing that is
   not common to all, and quite ordinary. They fulfilled the duties of
   religion, and of their state as others do, and in, apparently, the same
   way. For the rest, if one scrutinizes their conduct, nothing can be
   discovered either striking or peculiar; all follows the same course of
   ordinary events. That which might single them out is not discernible;
   it is that dependence on the supreme will which arranges all things for
   them, and in which they habitually live. The divine will confers on
   them a complete self-mastery on account of the habitual submission of
   their hearts.

   Therefore the souls in question are, by their state, both solitary and
   free; detached from all things in order to belong to God, to love Him
   in peace, and to fulfil faithfully the present duty according to His
   expressed will. They do not allow themselves to reflect, to neglect,
   nor to think of consequences, causes or reasons; it is enough for them
   to go on simply, accomplishing their plain duties just as if there did
   not exist for them anything but their present obligation, and their
   duty to God. The present moment, then, is like a desert in which the
   soul sees only God whom it enjoys; and is only occupied about those
   things which He requires of it, leaving and forgetting all else, and
   abandoning it to Providence. This soul, like an instrument, neither
   receives interiorly more than the operation of God effects passively,
   nor gives exteriorly more than this same operation applies actively.

   This interior application is accompanied by a free and active
   co-operation which is, at the same time, infused and mystical; that is
   to say that God, finding in this soul all the necessary qualifications
   for acting according to His laws, and satisfied with its goodwill,
   spares it the trouble of doing so, by bestowing all that would
   otherwise be the fruit of its efforts, or of its effectual goodwill. It
   is as though someone, seeing a friend preparing for a troublesome
   journey, would go in his stead, so that the friend would have the
   intention of going, but he spared the trouble of the journey; yet by
   this impersonation he would have gone himself, at least virtually. This
   journey would be free because it would be the result of a free
   determination taken beforehand to please the friend who then takes upon
   himself the trouble and expense; it would also be active because it
   will be a real advance; and it will be interior because effected
   without outward activity; and, finally, it will be mystical because of
   the hidden principle it contains. But to return to that kind of
   co-operation that we have explained by this imaginary journey; you will
   observe that it is entirely different from fidelity in the fulfilment
   of obligations. The work of fulfilling these is neither mystical nor
   infused, but free and active as commonly understood. Therefore
   abandonment to the good pleasure of God contains activity as well as
   passivity. In it there is nothing of self, but an habitual general
   goodwill, which like an instrument, has no action of itself, but
   responds to the touch of the master. While in his hands it fulfils all
   the purposes for which it was formed. Intentional and determined
   obedience to the will of God is, in the ordinary order of vigilance,
   care, attention, prudence, and discretion; although ordinary efforts
   are sensibly aided, or begun by grace. Leaving God, then, to act for
   all the rest, reserve for yourself at the present moment, only love and
   obedience, which virtues the soul will practise eternally. This love,
   infused into the soul in silence, is a real action of which it makes a
   perpetual obligation. It ought, in fact, to preserve it faithfully, and
   to maintain itself constantly in those dispositions resulting from it,
   all of which, it is evident, cannot be done without action. The action,
   however, is quite different to obedience to the present duty, by which
   the soul so disposes its faculties as to fulfil perfectly the will of
   God made manifest to it exteriorly, without expecting anything
   extraordinary.

   This divine will is to the soul in all things its method, its rule, and
   its direct and safe way. It is an unalterable law which is of all
   times, of all places, and of all states. It is a straight line which
   the soul must follow with courage and fidelity, neither diverging to
   the right, nor to the left, nor overstepping the bounds. Whatever is
   over and above must be received passively, as it carries on its work in
   abandonment. In a word, the soul is active in all that the present duty
   requires, but passive and submissive in all the rest, about which there
   should be no self-will, but patient waiting for the divine motion.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION V.--The Common Way of all Souls.

   The soul that aims at union with God should value all the operations of
   His grace, but should only attach itself to that of the present moment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is by union with the will of God that we enjoy and possess Him; and
   it is an illusion to endeavour to obtain this divine enjoyment by any
   other means. Union with the will of God is the universal means. It does
   not act by one method only, but all methods and all ways are, by its
   virtue, sanctified. The divine will unites God to our souls in many
   different ways, and that which suits us is always best for us. All ways
   should be esteemed and loved, because in each we should behold that
   which is ordained by God accommodating itself to each individual soul,
   and selecting the most suitable method of effecting by it the divine
   union. The duty of the soul is to submit to this choice, and to make
   none for itself; and this without dispensing itself from esteeming and
   loving this adorable will in its work in others. For instance, if this
   divine will should prevent me saying vocal prayers, having sensible
   devotion, or receiving lights on mysteries, I should still love and
   esteem the silence and bareness induced by the sight of the faith of
   others; while for myself I should make use of the present moment, and
   by it should become united to God. I should not, as the Quietists do,
   reduce all religion to personal inaction despising all other means;
   because what makes perfection is obedience to the law of God which
   always renders the means it applies suitable to the soul. No! I should
   not admit of obstacles or bounds to the will of God, neither should I
   take anything in place of it, but should welcome it in whatever way it
   was made manifest to me, and should revere it in whatever way it was
   pleased to unite itself to others. Thus all ordinary souls have but one
   common way in which each is distinct and different in order to form the
   variety of the mystical robe of the Church. All these souls mutually
   approve of, and esteem each other, and all say "We are going to the
   same goal by different paths, and are all united in the same way, and
   by the same means in the ordinance of God, which is so different in
   each." It is in this sense that we must read the lives of the saints,
   and other spiritual books, without ever making a change, and forsaking
   our own path. For this reason it is necessary that we should neither
   read spiritual books, nor hold spiritual conversation unless God so
   will; for, if He makes it the duty of the present moment, the soul, far
   from making any change will be strengthened in its way, either by what
   it finds in conformity with its own method, or even by that in which it
   differs. But if the will of God does not make this reading, or
   spiritual intercourse a present duty it will cause nothing but trouble,
   and a confusion of ideas; and a succession of changes will ensue;
   because without the concurrence of God's will there cannot be order in
   anything.

   Since when, therefore, have we busied ourselves with the pains and
   anxieties of our souls which have nothing to do with our present duty?
   When will God be all in all to us? Let creatures act according to their
   nature, but let nothing hinder us, let us go beyond all created things
   and live entirely for God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VI.--The Duty of the Present Moment the Only Rule.

   From souls in this state God exacts the most perfect docility to the
   action of His grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is necessary to be detached from all that one feels, and from all
   that one does, to follow this method, by which one subsists in God
   alone, and in the present duty. All regard to what is beyond this
   should be cut off as superfluous. One must restrict oneself to the
   present duty without thinking of the preceding one, or of the one which
   is to follow. I imagine the law of God to be always before you, and
   that the practice of abandonment has rendered your soul docile to the
   divine action. You feel some impulse that makes you say, "I have a
   drawing towards this person"; or "I have an inclination to read a
   certain book, to receive, or to give certain advice, to complain of
   certain things, to open my mind to another, or to receive confidence;
   to give away something, or to perform some action." Well! obey this
   impulse according to the inspiration of grace without stopping to
   reflect, to reason, or to make efforts. Give yourself up to these
   things for as long as God wishes without doing so through any
   self-will. In the state in question the will of God is shown to us
   because He dwells within us. This will ought to supplant all our usual
   supports. At each moment we have to practise some virtue. To this the
   obedient soul is faithful; nothing of what it has learnt by reading, or
   hearing is forgotten, and the most mortified novice could not fulfil
   her duties better. It is for this that these souls are attracted
   sometimes to one book, sometimes to another; or else to make some
   remark, some reflexion on what may seem but a trifling circumstance. At
   one time God gives them the attraction to learn something that at some
   future time will encourage them in the practice of virtue. Whatever
   these souls do, they do because they feel an attraction for it, without
   knowing why. All they can explain on the subject can be reduced to
   this: "I feel myself drawn to write, to read, to ask, to examine this;
   I follow this attraction, and God who gives it to me keeps these
   particular things in reserve in my faculties to become in future the
   nucleus of other attractions which will become useful to myself and
   others." This is what makes it necessary for these souls to be simple,
   gentle, yielding, and submissive to the faintest breath of these
   scarcely perceptible impressions.

   In the state of abandonment the only rule is the duty of the present
   moment. In this the soul is light as a feather, liquid as water, simple
   as a child, active as a ball in receiving and following all the
   inspirations of grace. Such souls have no more consistence and rigidity
   than molten metal. As this takes any form according to the mould into
   which it is poured, so these souls are pliant and easily receptive of
   any form that God chooses to give them. In a word, their disposition
   resembles the atmosphere, which is affected by every breeze; or water,
   which flows into any shaped vessel exactly filling every crevice. They
   are before God like a perfectly woven fabric with a clear surface; and
   neither think, nor seek to know what God will be pleased to trace
   thereon, because they have confidence in Him, they abandon themselves
   to Him, and, entirely absorbed by their duty, they think not of
   themselves, nor of what may be necessary for them, nor of how to obtain
   it. The more assiduously do they apply themselves to their little work,
   so simple, so hidden, so secret, and outwardly contemptible, the more
   does God embroider and embellish it with brilliant colours. On the
   surface of this simple canvas of love and obedience His hand traces the
   most beautiful design, the most delicate, and intricate pattern, the
   most divine figures. "Mirificavit Dominus sanctum suum." "The Lord hath
   made His holy one wonderful" (Psalm iv). It is true that a canvas
   simply and blindly given up to the work of the pencil only feels its
   movement at each moment. Each blow of the hammer on the chisel can only
   produce one cruel mark at a time, and the stone struck by repeated
   blows cannot know, nor see the form produced by them. It only feels
   that it is being diminished, filed, cut, and altered by the chisel. And
   a stone that is destined to become a crucifix or a statue without
   knowing it, if it were asked, "What is happening to you?" would reply
   if it could speak, "Do not ask me, I only know one thing, and that is,
   to remain immovable in the hands of my master, to love him, and to
   endure all that he inflicts upon me. As for the end for which I am
   destined, it is his business to understand how it is to be
   accomplished; I am as ignorant of what he is doing as of what I am
   destined to become; all I know is that his work is the best, and the
   most perfect that could be, and I receive each blow of the chisel as
   the most excellent thing that could happen to me, although, truth to
   tell, each blow, in my opinion, causes the idea of ruin, destruction,
   and disfigurement. But that is not my affair; content with the present
   moment, I think of nothing but my duty, and I endure the work of this
   clever master without knowing, or occupying myself about it."


   Yes! give to God what belongs to Him, and remain lovingly passive in
   his hands. Hold for certain that what takes place either exteriorly or
   interiorly is best for you.

   Allow God to act, and abandon yourself to Him. Let the chisel perform
   its office, the needle do its work. Let the brush of the artist cover
   the canvas with many tints which only have the appearance of daubs.
   Correspond with all these divine operations by a simple and constant
   submission, a forgetfulness of self, and an assiduous application to
   duty. Continue thus in your own groove without studying the way, the
   ins and outs, and surroundings, the names or particulars of the places;
   go on blindly pursuing this path, and you will be shown what is to
   follow. Seek only the kingdom of God and His justice by love and
   obedience, and all the rest will be added to you. We meet with many
   souls who are distressed about themselves, and inquire anxiously, "Who
   will direct us so that we may become mortified and holy, and attain
   perfection?" Let them search in books for the description and
   characteristics of this marvellous work, its nature and qualities; but
   as for you, do you remain peacefully united to God by love, and follow
   blindly the clear straight path of duty. The angels are at your side
   during this time of darkness, and they will bear you up. If God
   requires more of you, He will make it known to you by His inspirations.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VII.--Trust in the guidance of God.

   The docile soul will not seek to learn by what road God is conducting
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When God makes Himself the guide of a soul He exacts from it an
   absolute confidence in Him, and a freedom from any sort of disquietude
   as to the way in which He conducts it. This soul, therefore, is urged
   on without perceiving the path traced out before it. It does not
   imitate either what it has seen, or what it has read, but proceeds by
   its own action, and cannot do otherwise without grave risk. The divine
   action is ever fresh, it never retraces its steps, but always marks out
   new ways. Souls that are conducted by it never know where they are
   going; their ways are neither to be found in books, nor in their own
   minds; the divine action carries them step by step, and they progress
   only according to its movement.

   When you are conducted by a guide who takes you through an unknown
   country at night across fields where there are no tracks, by his own
   skill, without asking advice from anyone, or giving you any inkling of
   his plans; how can you choose but abandon yourself? Of what use is it
   looking about to find out where you are, to ask the passers-by, or to
   consult maps and travellers? The plans or fancies of a guide who
   insists on being trusted would not allow of this. He would take
   pleasure in overcoming the anxiety and distrust of the soul, and would
   insist on an entire surrender to his guidance. If one is convinced that
   he is a good guide one must have faith in him, and abandon oneself to
   his care.

   The divine action is essentially good; it does not need to be reformed
   or controlled. It began at the creation of the world; and to the
   present time has manifested ever fresh energy. Its operations are
   without limit, its fecundity inexhaustible. It acted in one way
   yesterday, to-day it acts differently. It is the same action applied at
   each moment to produce ever new effects, and it will extend from
   eternity to eternity. It has produced Abel, Noah, Abraham, all
   different types; Isaac, also original, and Jacob from no copy; neither
   does Joseph follow any prefigure. Moses has no prototype among his
   progenitors. David and the Prophets are quite apart from the
   Patriarchs. St. John the Baptist stands alone. Jesus Christ is the
   first-born; the Apostles act more by the guidance of His spirit than in
   imitation of His works.

   Jesus Christ did not set a limit for Himself, neither did He follow all
   His own maxims to the letter. The Holy Spirit ever inspired His holy
   soul and, being entirely abandoned to its every breath, it had no need
   to consult the moment that had passed, to know how to act in that which
   was coming. The breath of grace shaped every moment according to the
   eternal truths subsisting in the invisible and unfathomable wisdom of
   the Blessed Trinity. The soul of Jesus Christ received these directions
   at every moment, and acted upon them externally. The Gospel shows in
   the life of Jesus Christ a succession of these truths; and this same
   Jesus who lives and works always, continues to live and work in the
   souls of His saints.

   If you would live according to the Gospel, abandon yourself simply and
   entirely to the action of God. Jesus Christ is its supreme mouthpiece.
   "He was yesterday, is to-day, and will be for ever." (Hebr. xiii, 8);
   continuing, not recommencing His life. What He has done is finished;
   what remains to be done is being carried on at every moment. Each saint
   receives a share in this divine life, and in each, Jesus Christ is
   different, although the same in Himself. The life of each saint is the
   life of Jesus Christ; it is a new gospel. The cheeks of the spouse are
   compared to beds of flowers, to gardens filled with fragrant blossoms.
   The divine action is the gardener, admirably arranging the flower beds.
   This garden resembles no other, for among all the flowers there are no
   two alike, or that can be described as being of the same species,
   except in the fidelity with which they respond to the action of the
   Creator, in leaving Him free to do as He pleases, and, on their side,
   obeying the laws imposed on them by their nature. Let God act, and let
   us do what He requires of us; this is the Gospel; this is the general
   Scripture, and the common law.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VIII.--Great Faith is Necessary.

   This total abandonment is as simple as its effects are marvellous.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Such then is the straight path to sanctity. Such is the state of
   perfection, and of the duties imposed by it; such the great and
   incomparable secret of abandonment; a secret that is, in reality, no
   secret, an art without art.

   God, who exacts it of all, has explained it clearly, and made it
   intelligible, and quite simple. What is obscure in the way of pure
   faith is not necessary for the soul in that way, to practise; there is,
   in fact, nothing more easy to understand, nor more luminous; the
   mystery is only in what is done by God.

   This is what takes place in the Blessed Eucharist. That which is
   necessary to change bread into the Body of Jesus Christ, is so clear
   and so easy that the most ignorant priest is capable of doing it; yet
   it is the mystery of mysteries, where all is so hidden, so obscure, so
   incomprehensible that the more spiritual and enlightened one is, the
   more faith is required to believe it. The way of pure faith presents
   much that is similar. Its effect is to enable one to find God at each
   moment; it is this that makes it so exalted, so mystical, so blessed.
   It is an inexhaustible fund of thought, of discourse, of writing, it is
   a whole collection, and source of wonders. To produce so prodigious an
   effect but one thing is necessary; to let God act, and to do all that
   He wills according to one's state. Nothing in the spiritual life could
   be easier; nor more within the power of everyone; and yet nothing could
   be more wonderful, nor any path more obscure. To walk in it the soul
   has need of great faith, all the more so as reason is always
   suspicious, and has always some argument against it. All its ideas are
   confused. There is nothing in it that reason has ever known or read
   about, or been accustomed to admire; it is something quite new. "The
   Prophets were saints, but this Jesus is a sorcerer," said the Jews. If
   the soul following their example, is scandalised, it shows but little
   faith, and well deserves to be deprived of those wonderful things that
   God is so ready to work in the faithful soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    THE TRIALS CONNECTED WITH THE STATE OF ABANDONMENT.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--Unwise Interference.

   The first trial: the obloquy and unreasonable exactions of persons with
   a reputation for wisdom and piety.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is no way more secure than that of abandonment, and none more
   easy, sweet, clear, and less subject to illusion and error. In it God
   is loved and all Christian duties fulfilled; the Sacraments are
   frequented, and all the exterior acts of religion which are binding to
   all are performed. Superiors are obeyed, and the duties of the state of
   life are discharged; temptations of the flesh, the world, and the devil
   are continually resisted; for none are more on guard, or more vigilant
   in acquitting themselves of all their obligations, than those who
   follow this way.

   If this is the case, why is it that they should be subject to so many
   contradictions? The most usual of these is, that when they, like other
   Christians, have accomplished all that the most strict theologian could
   exact, they are expected also to be bound to inconvenient practices to
   which the Church by no means obliges them; and if they do not comply
   they are charged with labouring under illusion. But I ask, can a
   Christian who confines himself to the observance of God's commandments,
   and those of the Church, and who, besides, without practising
   meditation, contemplation, or spiritual reading, and without being
   attached to any particular form of devotion, yet attends to worldly
   business, and to other affairs of private life--can he be wrong? One
   cannot presume to accuse, or even to suspect him of error. One must
   admit this to oneself, and while leaving the Christian of whom I am
   speaking in peace, it is but justice not to trouble a soul that not
   only fulfils the precepts at least as well as one does oneself, but
   whom in addition, practises exterior acts of piety that are even
   unknown to others, or, if known, are treated with indifference.
   Prejudice goes so far as to affirm that this soul deceives itself, and
   deludes itself because, after having submitted to all that the Church
   prescribes, it holds itself free to be in the condition to give itself
   without hindrance to the interior operations of God, and to attend to
   the impressions of His grace at times when no other duty intervenes to
   expressly compel them. In a word they are condemned because they employ
   that time which others give to amusements and temporal affairs, in
   loving God. Is not this a crying injustice? This cannot be too strongly
   insisted upon. If anyone keeps the ordinary course, goes to confession
   once a year, nothing is said about it, he is left in peace with an
   occasional injunction, not pressed with too much importunity, nor
   making it an obligation, to do a little more. If he should change his
   ways and try to improve them, then he is overwhelmed with counsels for
   his conduct, and with different methods; and if he does not follow
   these pious rules diligently, then he is done for, he is a subject of
   suspicion, and nothing is too bad to predict of him.

   Are they not aware that these practices, however good and holy they may
   be, are, after all, only a way leading to divine union? Is it
   necessary, then, to be always on the road when one has already arrived
   at the goal.

   Nevertheless, it is this that is exacted of a soul which is supposed to
   be labouring under illusion. This soul has made its way, like others,
   at the beginning; like them it knew what to do, and did it faithfully;
   it would be vain now, to attempt to keep it bound to the same
   practices. Since God, moved by the efforts it has made to advance with
   these helps, has taken it on Himself to lead it to this happy union,
   from the time it arrived at the state of abandonment, and by love
   possessed God; in fine, from the time that the God of all goodness,
   relieving it of all its trouble and industry, made Himself the
   principle of its operations, these first methods lost all their value
   and were but the road it had traversed. To insist upon these methods
   being resumed and constantly followed, would be to make the soul
   forsake the end at which it had arrived to re-enter the way which led
   to it. But, if this soul has any experience, their time and trouble
   will be thrown away. In vain will they pursue it with noisy clamours;
   turning a deaf ear it will remain untroubled and unmoved in that
   intimate peace in which it so advantageously exercises its love. This
   is the centre in which it reposes, or, if you prefer it, it is the
   straight line traced by the hand of God. It will continue to walk
   therein, for all its duties are plainly marked out in it and by
   following this line it fulfils them without confusion or haste as they
   present themselves. For all else it holds itself in perfect liberty,
   always ready to obey every movement of grace directly it perceives it,
   and to abandon itself to the care of Providence. God makes known to
   this soul that He intends to be its Master, and to direct it by His
   grace; and makes it understand that it cannot, without attacking the
   sovereign rights of its Creator, allow its own liberty to be fettered.
   It feels that, if it tied itself down, to the rules of those who live
   by their own efforts and industry, instead of acting according to the
   attraction of grace, it would be deprived of many things necessary in
   order to be able to fulfil future duties. But, as no one knows this, it
   is judged and condemned for its simplicity, and, though it does not
   find fault with others but approves of every state, and well knows how
   to discern every degree of progress, it is despised by pretended
   wiseacres who cannot appreciate this sweet and hearty submission to
   divine Providence.

   Worldly wisdom cannot understand the perpetual wanderings of the
   Apostles, who did not settle anywhere. Ordinary spirituality also
   cannot endure that souls should depend for their action on divine
   Providence. There are but few in this state who approve of them, but
   God, who instructs men by means of their fellow creatures, never fails
   to make such souls encounter those who abandon themselves to Him with
   simplicity and fidelity. Besides, these latter require less direction
   than others in consequence of having attained to this state with the
   help of very good directors. If they find that they are occasionally
   left to themselves, it is because divine Providence removes by death,
   or banishes by some event, the guides who have led them in this way.
   Even then, they are always willing to be guided, and only wait in peace
   the moment arranged by Providence. During the time of privation also,
   they meet from time to time persons in whom they feel they can repose a
   confidence inspired by God, although they know nothing about them. This
   is a sign that He makes use of them to communicate certain lights, even
   if these are only temporary. These souls ask advice, therefore, and
   when it is given they follow it with the greatest docility. In default
   of such assistance however, they have recourse to the maxims supplied
   to them by their first directors. Thus they are always very well
   directed, either by the old principles formerly received, or by the
   advice of those directors they encounter, and they make use of all
   until God sends them persons in whom they can confide, and who will
   show them His Will.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--Unjust Judgments.

   Second trial of the state of abandonment. The apparent uselessness and
   exterior defects allowed by God in the souls He wills to raise to this
   state.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The second trial of souls conducted by God in this way is the result of
   their apparent uselessness, and of their exterior defects. There can be
   neither honour nor reward in a service hidden, often enough, under the
   most utter incapacity and uselessness, as far as the world is
   concerned. Doubtless those who are given more important posts, are not,
   on this account, necessarily precluded from the state of abandonment.
   Less still is this state incompatible with striking virtue, and that
   sanctity which attracts universal veneration. Nevertheless there is a
   far greater number of souls raised to this sublime state whose virtue
   is known only to God. By their state these souls are free from nearly
   every outward obligation. They are little suited for worldly business
   or affairs, for complicated concerns, or for putting their mind into
   the conducting of industries. It seems as though they were quite
   useless; nothing is noticeable in them but feebleness of body, mind,
   imagination and passions. They take no notice of anything. They are, so
   to say, quite stupid, and possess nothing of that culture, study, or
   reflexion which go to the making of a man. They are like children of
   nature before they are placed in the hands of masters to be formed.
   They have noticeable faults which, without rendering them more guilty
   than children, cause more offence. God takes away everything but
   innocence in order that they should have nothing to rely upon but Him
   alone. The world, being in ignorance of this mystery can only judge by
   appearance, and can find nothing in them to its taste, nor anything
   that it values. It, therefore, rejects and despises them, and they seem
   to be exposed to censure from all. The more closely they are observed,
   the less is thought of them and the more opposition do they encounter;
   no one knows what to make of them. Although some hidden voice seems to
   speak in their favour, yet people prefer to adhere to their own
   malignant prepossessions rather than to follow this instinct, or at
   least to suspend their judgment. Their actions are pried into to find
   out their opinions, and like the Pharisees who could not endure the
   actions of Jesus, they are regarded with such prejudice that everything
   they do appears either ridiculous or criminal.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--Self-Contempt.

   The third trial: interior humiliations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Contemptible as they are in the eyes of others, the souls raised by God
   to this state are far more contemptible in their own. There is nothing
   either in what they do, or in what they suffer that is not altogether
   paltry and humiliating; there is nothing striking in anything about
   them, all is quite ordinary, nothing but troubles and afflictions
   interiorly, and contradictions and disappointments exteriorly. With a
   feeble body requiring many alleviations and comforts, the very reverse
   one would think of that spirit of poverty and austerity so much admired
   in the saints. Neither heroic undertakings, nor fasts, large alms, nor
   ardent and far-reaching zeal can be discerned in them; but united to
   God by faith and love they behold in themselves nothing but disorder.
   They despise themselves still more by comparison with those who pass
   for saints, and who, besides adapting themselves with facility to rules
   and methods show nothing irregular either in their persons or actions.
   Therefore their own short-comings in this respect fill them with
   confusion, and are unbearable to them. It is on this account that they
   give way to sighs and tears, marking the grief with which they are
   oppressed. Let us remember that Jesus Christ was both God and man; as
   man He was destroyed, and as God He remained full of glory. These souls
   have no participation in His glory, but they share in the sadness and
   misery of His sufferings. Men regard them in the same way as Herod and
   his court regarded Jesus Christ. These poor souls, therefore, are
   nourished as to their senses and mind, with a most disgusting food, in
   which they can find no pleasure. They aspire to something quite
   different, but all the avenues leading to the sanctity they so much
   desire, remain closed to them. They must live on this bread of
   suffering, on this bread mingled with ashes, with a continual shrinking
   both exterior and interior. They have formed an idea of saintliness
   which gives them constant and irremediable torment. The will hungers
   for it, but is powerless to practise it. Why should this be, except to
   mortify the soul in that which is its most spiritual and intimate part,
   which, finding no satisfaction or pleasure in anything that happens to
   it, must needs place all its affection in God who conducts it this way
   for the express purpose of preventing it taking pleasure in anything
   but Him alone.

   It seems to me that it is easy to conclude from all this that souls
   abandoned to God cannot occupy themselves, as others do, with desires,
   examinations, cares, or attachments to certain persons. Neither can
   they form plans, nor lay down methodical rules for their actions, or
   for reading. This would imply that they still had power to dispose of
   themselves, which would entirely exclude the state of abandonment in
   which they are placed. In this state they give up to God all their
   rights over themselves, over their words, actions, thoughts, and
   proceedings; over the employment of their time and everything connected
   with it. There remains only one desire, to satisfy the Master they have
   chosen, to listen unceasingly to the expression of His will in order to
   execute it immediately. No condition can better represent this state
   than that of a servant who obeys every order he receives, and does not
   occupy his time in attending to his own affairs; these he neglects in
   order to serve His Master at every moment. These souls then should not
   be distressed at their powerlessness; they are able to do much in being
   able to give themselves entirely to a Master who is all-powerful, and
   able to work wonders with the feeblest of instruments if they offer no
   resistance.

   Let us, then, endure without annoyance the humiliations entailed on us
   in our own eyes, and in the eyes of others, by what shows outwardly in
   our lives; or rather, let us conceal ourselves behind these outward
   appearances and enjoy God who is all ours. Let us profit by this
   apparent failure, by these requirements, by this care-taking and the
   necessity of constant nourishment, and of comfort; of our ill-success,
   of the contempt of others, of these fears, uncertainties, troubles,
   etc., to find all our wealth and happiness in God, who, by these means,
   gives Himself entirely to us as our only good. God wishes to be ours in
   a poor way, without all those accessories of sanctity which make others
   to be admired, and this is because God would have Himself to be the
   sole food of our souls, the only object of our desires. We are so weak
   that if we displayed the virtues of zeal, almsgiving, poverty, and
   austerity, we should make them subjects for vainglory. But as it is,
   everything is disagreeable in order that God may be our whole
   sanctification, our whole support, so that the world despises us, and
   leaves us to enjoy our treasure in peace. God desires to be the
   principle of all that is holy in us, and therefore what depends on
   ourselves and on our active fidelity is very small, and appears quite
   contrary to sanctity. There cannot be anything great in us in the sight
   of God except our passive endurance. Therefore let us think of it no
   more, let us leave the care of our sanctification to God who well knows
   how to effect it. It all depends on the watchful care, and particular
   operation of divine Providence, and is accomplished in a great measure
   without our knowledge, and even in a way that is unexpected, and
   disagreeable to us. Let us fulfil peacefully the little duties of our
   active fidelity, without aspiring to those that are greater, because
   God does not give Himself to us by reason of our own efforts. We shall
   become saints of God, of His grace, and of His special providence. He
   knows what rank to give us, let us leave it to Him, and without forming
   to ourselves false ideas, and empty systems of sanctity, let us content
   ourselves with loving Him unceasingly, and in pursuing with simplicity
   the path He has marked out for us, where all is so mean and paltry in
   our eyes, and in the estimation of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--Distrust of Self.

   The fourth trial of souls in the state of abandonment: the obscurity of
   their state, and their apparent opposition to the will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For a soul that desires nothing else but the will of God, what could be
   more miserable than the impossibility of being certain of loving Him?
   Formerly it was mentally enlightened to perceive in what consisted the
   plan for its perfection, but it is no longer able to do so in its
   present state. Perfection is given to it contrary to all preconceived
   ideas, to all light, to all feeling. It is given by all the crosses
   sent by Providence, by the action of present duties, by certain
   attractions, which have in them no good beyond that of not leading to
   sin; but seem very far from the dazzling sublimity of sanctity, and all
   that is unusual in virtue. God and His grace are given in a hidden and
   strange manner, for the soul feels too weak to bear the weight of its
   crosses, and disgusted with its obligations. Its attractions are only
   for quite ordinary exercises. The ideal it has formed of sanctity
   reproaches it interiorly for its mean and contemptible disposition. All
   books treating of the lives of the saints condemn it, it can find
   nothing in vindication of its conduct; it beholds a brilliant sanctity
   which renders it disconsolate because it has not strength sufficient to
   attain to it, and it does not see that its weakness is divinely
   ordered, but looks upon it as cowardice. Those whom it knows to be
   distinguished for striking virtue, of sublime contemplation regard it
   only with contempt. "What a strange saint," say they; and the soul,
   believing this, and confused by its countless useless efforts to raise
   itself from this low condition, is overwhelmed with opprobrium, and has
   nothing to advance in its own favour either to itself or to others. The
   soul in this state feels as if it were lost. Its reflexions afford it
   no help for its guidance, or enlightenment, and divine grace seems to
   have failed it. It is, however, through this loss that it finds again
   that same grace substituted under a different form, and restoring a
   hundredfold more than it took away by the purity of its hidden
   impressions.

   This is, without doubt, a death-blow to the soul, for it loses sight of
   the divine will which, so to speak, withdraws itself from observation
   to stand behind it and push it on, becoming thus its invisible
   principle, and no longer its clearly defined object. Experience proves
   that nothing kindles the desire more than this apparent loss; therefore
   the soul vehemently desires to be united to the divine will, and gives
   vent to the most profound sighs, finding no possible consolation
   anywhere. A heart that has no other wish but to possess God must
   attract Him to itself; and this secret of love is a very great one
   since by this way alone are established in the soul sure faith and firm
   hope. It is then that we believe what we cannot see, and expect to
   possess what we cannot feel. Oh! how much does this incomprehensible
   conduct of an action, of which one is both subject and instrument, tend
   to one's perfection without any visible sign of appearance. Everything
   that one does seems done by chance, or natural inclination, and is very
   humiliating to the soul. When inspired to speak, it seems as if one
   spoke only from oneself. One never sees by what spirit one is impelled;
   the most divine inspiration is a terror, and whatever one does or feels
   is a source of constant self-contempt, as though it were all faulty and
   imperfect. Others are always admired, and one feels very inferior to
   them, while their whole way of acting causes confusion. The soul
   distrusts its own judgment, and cannot be certain about any of its
   thoughts; it pays excessive submission to the least advice given by a
   respectable authority, and the divine action in thus keeping it apart
   from striking virtue seems to plunge it into deeper humiliation. This
   humiliation has no appearance of virtue to the soul; according to its
   own idea it is pure justice. The most admirable thing about it is, that
   in the eyes of others whom God does not enlighten, and even in its own
   eyes, the soul appears actuated by feelings absolutely contrary to
   virtue, such as pure obstinacy, disobedience, troublesomeness,
   contempt, and indignation, for which there seems no remedy. The more
   earnestly the soul strives to overcome these defects the more do they
   increase, because they form part of the design of God as being the most
   suitable means of detaching the soul from itself to prepare it for the
   divine union.

   It is from this sad trial that the principal merit of the state of
   abandonment is gained. Now all is of a nature to withdraw the soul from
   its narrow path of love and simple obedience and it requires heroic
   virtue and courage to keep firm in plain active fidelity, and to sing
   its part in a song that seems to express in its tones that the soul is
   mistaken and lost; while grace sings a second. It does not hear this,
   however, and if it has courage to let the thunder roll, the lightning
   flash, and the tempest roar, and to walk with a firm tread in the path
   of love and obedience, of duty, and of the present attraction, it can
   be compared to the soul of Jesus during His passion, when our divine
   Saviour walked steadfastly in the fulfiling of the will of His Father,
   and in His love which imposed upon Him a task apparently quite
   inconsistent with the dignity of a soul of such sanctity as His.

   The hearts of Jesus and Mary, bearing the fury of that darkest of
   nights, let the clouds gather, and the storm rage. A multitude of
   things in appearance most opposed to the designs of God and of His
   order, overwhelmed their faculties; but though deprived of all sensible
   support they walked without faltering in the path of love and
   obedience. Their eyes were fixed only on what they had to do, and
   leaving God to act as He pleased with all that concerned them, they
   endured the whole weight of that divine action. They groaned under the
   burden, but not for a single instant did they waver or pause. They
   believed that all would be well, provided that they kept on their way
   and let God act.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION V.--The Life of Faith.

   The fruit of these trials. The conduct of the submissive soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It results from all that has just been described that, in the path of
   pure faith, all that takes place spiritually, physically, and
   temporarily, has the aspect of death. This is not to be wondered at.
   What else could be expected? It is natural to this state. God has His
   plans for souls, and under this disguise He carries them out very
   successfully. Under the name of "disguise" I include ill-success,
   corporal infirmities, and spiritual weakness. All succeeds, and turns
   to good in the hands of God. It is by those things that are a trouble
   to nature that He prepares for the accomplishment of His greatest
   designs. "Omnia cooperantur in bonum iis qui secundum propositum vocati
   sunt sancti." "All things work together unto good to such as according
   to His purpose are called to be saints." (Rom. viii, 28). He brings
   life out of the shadow of death; therefore, when nature is afraid,
   faith, which takes everything in a good sense, is full of courage and
   confidence. To live by faith is to live by joy, confidence, and
   certainty about all that has to be done or suffered at each moment
   according to the designs of God. It is in order to animate and to
   maintain this life of faith that God allows the soul to be plunged into
   and carried away by the rough waters of so many pains, troubles,
   difficulties, fatigues and overthrows; for it requires faith to find
   God in all these things. The divine life is given at every moment in a
   hidden but very sure manner, under different appearances such as, the
   death of the body, the supposed loss of the soul, and the confusion of
   all earthly affairs. In all these, faith finds its food and support. It
   pierces through all, and clings to the hand of God, the giver of life.
   Through all that does not partake of the nature of sin, the faithful
   soul should proceed with confidence, taking it all as a veil, or
   disguise of God whose immediate presence alarms and at the same time
   reassures the faculties of the soul. In fact this great God who
   consoles the humble, gives the soul in the midst of its greatest
   desolation an interior assurance that it has nothing to fear, provided
   it allows Him to act, and abandons itself entirely to Him. It is
   grieved because it has lost its Well-beloved, and yet something assures
   it that it possesses Him. It is troubled and disturbed, yet
   nevertheless has in its depths I know not what important grounds for
   attaching itself steadfastly to God. "Truly," said Jacob, "God is in
   this place, and I knew it not" (Gen. xxviii, 16). You seek God and He
   is everywhere; everything proclaims Him, everything gives Him to you.
   He walks by your side, is around you and within you: there He lives,
   and yet you seek Him. You seek your own idea of God while all the time
   you possess Him substantially. You seek perfection, and it is in
   everything that presents itself to you. Your sufferings, your actions,
   your attractions are the species under which God gives Himself to you,
   while you are vainly striving after sublime ideas which He by no means
   assumes in order to dwell in you.

   Martha tried to please Jesus by cooking nice dishes, but Mary was
   content to be with Jesus in any way that He wished to give Himself to
   her; but when Mary sought Him in the garden according to the idea she
   had formed of Him, He eluded her by presenting Himself in the form of a
   gardener. The Apostles saw Jesus, but mistook Him for a phantom. God
   disguises Himself, therefore, to raise the soul to the state of pure
   faith, to teach it to find Him under every kind of appearance; for,
   when it has discovered this secret of God, it is in vain for Him to
   disguise Himself; it says, "He is there, behind the wall, He is looking
   through the lattice, looking from the windows" (Cant. ii, 9). Oh!
   divine Love, hide yourself, proceed from one trial to another, bind by
   attractions; blend, confuse, or break like threads all the ideas and
   methods of the soul. May it stray hither and thither for want of light,
   and be unable to see or understand in what path it should walk;
   formerly it found You dwelling in Your ordinary guise, in the peaceful
   repose of solitude and prayer, or in suffering; even in the
   consolations You give to others, in the course of conversation, or in
   business; but now after having tried every method known to please you,
   it has to stand aside not seeing You in any of these things as in
   former times. May the uselessness of its efforts teach it to seek You
   henceforth in Yourself, which means to seek You everywhere, in all
   things without distinction and without reflexion; for, oh divine Love!
   what a mistake it is, not to find you in all that is good, and in every
   creature. Why then seek You in any other way than that by which You
   desire to give Yourself? Why, divine Love, seek You under any other
   species than those which You have chosen for Your Sacrament? The less
   there is to be seen or felt so much the more scope for faith and
   obedience. Do You not give fecundity to the root hidden underground,
   and can You not, if You so will, make this darkness in which You are
   pleased to keep me, fruitful? Live then, little root of my heart, in
   the deep, invisible heart of God; and by its power, send forth
   branches, leaves, flowers and fruits, which, although invisible to
   yourself, are a pure joy and nourishment to others. Without consulting
   your own taste, give of your shade, flowers, and fruit to others. May
   all that is grafted on you receive that indeterminate sap which will be
   known only by the growth and appearance of those same grafts. Become
   all to all, but as to yourself remain abandoned and indifferent. Remain
   in the dark and narrow prison of your miserable cocoon, little worm,
   until the warmth of grace forms you, and sets you free. Then feed upon
   whatever leaves it offers you, and do not regret, in the activity of
   abandonment, the peace you have lost. Stop directly the divine action
   would have you stop, and be content to lose, in the alternations of
   repose and activity, in incomprehensible changes, all your old
   formulas, methods and ways, to take upon you those designed for you by
   the divine action. Thus you will spin your silk in secret, doing what
   you can neither see nor feel. You will condemn in yourself a secret
   envy of your companions who are apparently dead and motionless, because
   they have not yet arrived at the point that you have attained; you
   continue to admire them although you have surpassed them. May your
   affliction in your abandonment continue while you spin a silk in which
   the princes of the Church and of the world and all sorts of souls will
   glory to be attired.

   After that what will become of you, little worm? by what outlet will
   you come forth? Oh! marvel of grace by which souls are moulded in so
   many different shapes! Who can guess in what direction grace will guide
   it? And who could guess either, what nature does with a silkworm if he
   had not seen it working? It is only necessary to provide it with
   leaves, and nature does the rest.

   Therefore no soul can tell from whence it came, nor whither it is
   going; neither from what thought of God the divine wisdom drew it, nor
   to what end it tends. Nothing is left but an entire passive
   abandonment, and to allow this divine Wisdom to act without interfering
   by our own reflexions, examples and methods. We must act when the time
   to act comes, and cease when it is time to stop; if necessary letting
   all be lost, and thus, acting or remaining passive according to
   attraction and abandonment we, insensibly, do, or leave undone without
   knowing what will be the result; and after many changes the formed soul
   receives wings and flies up to Heaven, leaving a plentiful harvest on
   earth for other souls to gather.

  CHAPTER IV.

    CONCERNING THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY THE FATHERLY PROVIDENCE OF GOD TO
    THOSE SOULS WHO HAVE ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO HIM.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION I.--Confidence in God.

   The less the soul in the state of abandonment feels the help it
   receives from God, the more efficaciously does He sustain it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is a kind of sanctity in which all the communications of God are
   luminous and distinct; but in the passive state of pure faith all that
   God communicates partakes of the nature of that inaccessible darkness
   that surrounds His throne, and all ideas are confused and indistinct.
   The soul, in this state of obscurity is often afraid, like the Prophet,
   of running headlong against a rock. "Fear not, faithful soul, for this
   is your right path, and the way by which God conducts you. There is no
   way more safe and sure than this dark way of faith." "But it is so dark
   that I cannot tell which way to go." "Go wherever you please; you
   cannot lose the way where there is no path; every way looks the same in
   the dark, you cannot see the end because nothing is visible." "But I am
   afraid of everything. I feel as if, at any moment, I might fall over a
   precipice. Everything is an affliction to me; I well know that I am
   acting according to abandonment, but it seems to me that there are
   things I cannot do without acting contrary to virtue. I seem to be so
   far from all the virtues. The more I wish to practise them the more
   remote they seem. I love virtue, but the obscure impressions by which I
   am attracted seem to keep virtue far from me. I always give in to this
   attraction, and although I cannot perceive that it guides me well, I
   cannot help following it. The spirit seeks light; but the heart is in
   darkness. Enlightened persons, and those with lucid minds are congenial
   to my spirit, but when I hear conversations and listen to discourses,
   my heart understands nothing; its whole state and way is simply an
   impression of the gift of faith, which makes it love and appreciate
   those principles, truths, and paths wherein the spirit has neither
   object nor idea, and in which it trembles, shudders, and falters. I
   have an assurance, I do not know how, in the depths of my heart, that
   this way is right; not by the evidence of my senses, but by a feeling
   inspired by faith." This is because it is impossible for God to lead a
   soul without persuading it that the path is a right one, and this with
   a certainty all the greater the less it is perceived. And this
   certainty is victorious over all censures, fears, efforts, and all
   imaginations. The mind vainly cries out and seeks some better way. The
   bride recognises the Bridegroom unconsciously, but when she stretches
   out her hand to hold Him, He disappears. She understands that the
   Spouse to whom she belongs has rights over her, and she prefers to
   wander without order or method in abandoning herself to His guidance
   rather than to endeavour to gain confidence by following the beaten
   tracks of virtue.

   Let us go to God, then, my soul, in abandonment, and let us acknowledge
   that we are incapable of acquiring virtue by our own industry or
   effort; but let us not allow this absence of particular virtues to
   diminish our confidence. Our divine Guide would not have reduced us to
   the necessity of walking if He had not intended to carry us in His
   arms. What need have we of lights and certainties, ideas and
   reflexions? Of what use would it be to us to see, to know, and to feel,
   when we are no longer walking but being carried in the arms of divine
   Providence. The more we have to suffer from darkness, and the more
   rocks, precipices, and deserts there are in our way; the more we have
   to endure from fears, dryness, weariness of mind, anguish of soul, and
   even despair, and the sight of purgatory and hell, the greater must be
   our confidence and faith. One glance at Him who carries us is
   sufficient to restore our courage in the greatest peril. We will forget
   the paths and what they are like; we will forget ourselves, and
   abandoning ourselves entirely to the wisdom, goodness, and power of our
   Guide we will think only of loving Him, and avoiding all sin, not only
   that which is evident, however venial it may be, but even the
   appearance of evil, and of fulfilling all the duties and obligations of
   our state.

   This is the only charge You lay upon Your children, O divine Love! all
   the rest You take upon Yourself. The more terrible this may be, the
   more surely can Your presence be felt and recognised. Your children
   have only to love You without ceasing, and to fulfil their small duties
   like children. A child on its mother's lap is occupied only with its
   games as if it had nothing else to do but to play with its mother. The
   soul should soar above the clouds, and, as no one can work during the
   darkness of the night, it is the time for repose. The light of reason
   can do nothing but deepen the darkness of faith: the radiance necessary
   to disperse it must proceed from the same source as itself. In this
   state God communicates Himself to the soul as its life, but He is no
   longer visible as its way, and its truth: The bride seeks the
   Bridegroom during this night; she seeks Him before her, and hurries
   forward; but He is behind her, and holding her with His hands. He is no
   longer object, or idea, but principle and source. For all the needs,
   difficulties, troubles, falls, overthrows, persecutions, and
   uncertainties of souls which have lost all confidence in themselves and
   their own action, there are secret and inspired resources in the divine
   action, marvellous and unknown. The more perplexing the circumstances
   the keener is the expectation of a satisfactory solution. The heart
   says "All goes well, it is God who carries on the work, there is
   nothing to fear." That very suspense and desolation are verses in the
   canticle of darkness. It is a joy that not a single syllable is left
   out, and it all ends in a "Gloria Patri"; therefore we pursue the way
   of our wanderings, and darkness itself is a light for our guidance; and
   doubts are our best assurance. The more puzzled Isaac was to find
   something to sacrifice, the more completely did Abraham place all in
   the hands of Providence, and trust entirely in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION II.--Diversity of Grace.

   The afflictions which the soul is made to endure are but loving
   artifices of God which will, one day, give it great joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Souls that walk in light sing the canticles of the light; those that
   walk in darkness sing the songs of the darkness. Both must be allowed
   to sing to the end the part allotted to them by God in the great
   Oratorio. Nothing must be added to the score, nothing left out; every
   drop of bitterness must be allowed to flow freely at whatever cost. It
   was thus with Jeremias and Ezechiel whose utterances were broken by
   tears and sobs, and who could find no consolation except in continuing
   their lamentations. Had the course of their grief been interrupted, we
   should have lost the most beautiful passages of Scripture. The Spirit
   that afflicts can also console; these diverse waters flow from the same
   source. When God appears angry the soul trembles; when He threatens it
   is terrified. The divine operation must be allowed to develop, for with
   the evil it carries a remedy; so continue to weep and to tremble; let
   restlessness and agony invade your souls, make no effort to free
   yourselves from these divine terrors, these heavenly troubles, but open
   your hearts to receive these little streams from that immense sea of
   sorrows which God bore in His most holy soul. Sow in sorrow for as long
   as grace requires, and that same grace will gradually dry your tears.
   Darkness will disappear before the radiance of the sun, springtime will
   come with its flowers, and the result of your abandonment will be seen
   in the admirable diversity of the divine action. Indeed it is quite
   useless for man to trouble himself; all that takes place in him is like
   a dream. One cloud chases another like imaginations in the brain of the
   sleeper, some sorrowful, others consoling. The soul is the playground
   of these phantoms which follow each other with great rapidity, and on
   awaking it feels that, in all this, there is nothing to detain it. When
   these impressions have passed away it takes no notice of the joys or
   sorrows of dreams.

   O Lord! it can be truly said that You carry Your children in Your arms
   during this long night of faith, and that You are pleased to allow an
   infinite variety of thoughts to pass through their minds; thoughts holy
   and mysterious. In the state in which these dreams of the night place
   them, they indeed experience the utmost torment of fear, anguish, and
   weariness, but on the bright day of eternal glory these will give place
   to a true and solid joy.

   It is at the moment of, and just after the awakening that holy souls,
   returning to themselves, and with full right to judge, can never tire
   of admiring and praising the tact, the inventions and refinements of
   loving deception practised by the divine Spouse. They understand how
   impenetrable are His ways, how impossible it is to guess His enigmas,
   to find out His disguises, or to receive consolation when it is His
   will to spread terror and alarm.

   At this awakening those who, like Jeremias and David, have been
   inconsolable in their grief, will see that in their desolation they
   have been a subject of joy to the angels, and of glory to God. The
   bride sleeps through the bustle of industries, and of human actions,
   and in spite of the sneers of sceptics. In her sleep she will sigh and
   tremble; in her dreams she will pursue and seek her Spouse, who
   disguises Himself to deceive her.

   Let her dream; her fears are only born of the night, and of sleep. When
   the Spouse has exercised her beloved soul, and shown forth in it what
   can only be expressed by Him, He will develop the result of these
   dreams and will awaken it at the right time.

   Joseph caused Benjamin to weep, and his servants kept his secret from
   this beloved brother. Joseph deceived him, and not all his penetration
   and wit could fathom this deception. Benjamin and his brothers were
   plunged in unspeakable sorrow but Joseph was only playing a trick on
   them, although the poor brothers could see nothing but an evil without
   any remedy. When he reveals himself and puts everything right they
   admire his wisdom in making them think that all is lost, and to cause
   them to despair about that which turns out to be a subject of the
   greatest joy they have ever experienced.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION III.--The Generosity of God.

   The more God seems to despoil the soul that is in the state of
   abandonment, the more generous are His gifts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let us continue to advance in the knowledge of the divine action and of
   its loving deceptions. That which it withdraws from the perception, it
   bestows incognito, as it were, on the goodwill. It never allows it to
   want for anything. It is as if someone who had maintained a friend by
   bounties bestowed personally upon him, should suddenly, for the welfare
   of this same friend, pretend that he could no longer oblige him, yet
   continues to assist him without making himself known. The friend, not
   suspecting any stratagem in this mystery of love, feels hurt, and
   entertains all sorts of ideas and criticisms on the conduct, of his
   benefactor.

   When, however, the mystery begins to be revealed, God knows what
   different feelings arise in the soul; joy, tenderness, gratitude, love,
   confusion and admiration; followed by an increase of zeal for, and
   attachment to the benefactor. And this trial will be the means of
   strengthening the soul, and accustoming it to similar surprises.

   The application is easy. With God, the more one seems to lose the more
   one gains. The more He strikes off of what is natural, the more He
   gives of what is supernatural. He is loved at first for His gifts, but
   when these are no longer perceptible He is at last loved for Himself.
   It is by the apparent withdrawal of these sensible gifts that He
   prepares the way for that great gift which is the most precious and the
   most extensive of all, since it embraces all others. Souls which have
   once for all submitted themselves to the divine action, ought to
   interpret everything favourably. Yes, everything! even the loss of the
   most excellent directors, and the want of confidence they cannot help
   feeling in those who offer themselves for that post.

   In truth those guides who, of their own accord, run after souls,
   deserve to be distrusted. Those who are truly inspired by the spirit of
   God do not, as a rule, show so much eagerness and self sufficiency.
   They do not come forward until they are appealed to, and even then they
   proceed with caution. May the soul that has given itself entirely to
   God pass without fear through all these trials without losing its
   balance. Provided it is faithful to the divine action, this
   all-powerful action can produce marvels in it in spite of every
   obstacle.

   God and the soul work in common, and the success of the work depends
   entirely on the divine Workman, and can only be spoilt if the soul
   prove unfaithful. When the soul is well, all is well, because what is
   from God, that is to say, His part and His action are, as it were, the
   counterpoise of the fidelity of the soul. It is the best part of the
   work, which is done something like beautiful tapestry, stitch by stitch
   from the wrong side. The worker employed on it sees only the stitch he
   is making, and the needle with which he makes it, while all the
   stitches combined form magnificent figures which do not show until,
   every part being complete, the right side is turned outwards. All the
   beauty and perfection of the work remain in obscurity during its
   progress. It is the same with the soul that has abandoned itself to
   God; it has eyes only for Him and for its duty. The performance of this
   duty is, at each moment, but an imperceptible stitch added to the work,
   and yet with these stitches God performs wonders of which He sometimes
   allows a glimpse to be seen, but which will not be visible in their
   entirety till revealed on the great day of eternity. How full of
   goodness and wisdom is the guidance of God! He has so entirely kept for
   His own grace, and His own action, all that is admirable, great,
   exalted and sublime; and so completely left to our souls, with the aid
   of grace, all that is little, light and easy, that there is no one in
   the world who cannot easily reach a most eminent degree of perfection
   in accomplishing lovingly the most ordinary and obscure duties.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IV.--The Most Ordinary Things are Channels of Grace.

   In the state of abandonment God guides the soul more safely the more
   completely He seems to blind it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is most especially with regard to souls that abandon themselves
   entirely to God that the words of St. John are applicable: "You have no
   need that any man teach you, as His unction teacheth you of all things"
   (I Eph., St. John, ii, 20). To know what God demands of them they need
   only probe their own hearts, and listen to the inspirations of this
   unction, which interpret the will of God according to circumstances.

   The divine action, concealed though it is, reveals its designs, not
   through ideas, but intuitively. It shows them to the soul either
   necessarily, by not permitting any other thing to be chosen but what is
   actually present, or else by a sudden impulse, a sort of supernatural
   feeling that impels the soul to act without premeditation; or, in fine,
   by some kind of inclination or aversion which, while leaving it
   complete liberty, yet none the less leads it to take or refuse what is
   presented to it. If one were to judge by appearances, it seems as if it
   would be a great want of virtue to be swayed and influenced in this
   manner; and if one were to judge by ordinary rules, there appears a
   want of regulation and method in such conduct; but in reality it is the
   highest degree of virtue, and only after having practised it for a long
   time does one succeed. The virtue in this state is pure virtue; it is,
   in fact, perfection itself. One is like a musician, who combines a
   perfect knowledge of music with technical skill: he would be so full of
   his art that, without thinking, all that he performed within its
   compass would be perfect; and if his compositions were examined
   afterwards, they would be found in perfect conformity with prescribed
   rules. One would then become convinced that he would never succeed
   better than when, free from the rules that keep genius in fetters when
   too scrupulously followed, he acted without constraint; and that his
   impromptus would be admired as chef d'oeuvres by all connoisseurs. Thus
   the soul, trained for a long time in the science and practice of
   perfection under the influence of reasonings and methods of which it
   made use to assist grace, forms for itself a habit of acting in all
   things by the instincts implanted by God. It then knows that it can do
   nothing better than what first presents itself, without all those
   arguments of which it had need formerly. The only thing to be done is
   to act at random when unable to trust in anything but the workings of
   grace which cannot mislead it. The effects of grace, visible to
   watchful eyes, and intelligent minds, are nothing short of marvellous.

   Without method, yet most exact; without rule, yet most orderly; without
   reflexion, yet most profound; without skill, yet thoroughly well
   constructed; without effort, yet everything accomplished; and without
   foresight, yet nothing better suited to unexpected events. Spiritual
   reading with the divine action, often contains a meaning that the
   author never thought of. God makes use of the words and actions of
   others to infuse truths which might otherwise have remained hidden. If
   He wishes to impart light in this way, it is for the submissive soul to
   avail itself of this light. Every expedient of the divine action has an
   efficacy which always surpasses its apparent and natural virtue.

   It is the nature of abandonment always to lead a mysterious life, and
   to receive great and miraculous gifts from God by means of the most
   ordinary things, things that may be natural, accidental, or that seem
   to happen by chance, and in which there seems no other agency than the
   ordinary course of the ways of the world, or of the elements. In this
   way the simplest sermons, the most commonplace conversations, and the
   least high-toned books, become to these souls, by the virtue of God's
   will, sources of knowledge and wisdom. This is why they carefully
   gather up the crumbs that sceptics trample underfoot. Everything is
   precious in their eyes, everything enriches them. They are
   inexpressibly indifferent towards all things, and yet neglect nothing,
   having a respect for, and making use of all things. As God is
   everywhere, the use made of things by His will is not so much the use
   of creatures, as the enjoyment of the divine action which transmits His
   gifts by different channels. They cannot sanctify of themselves, but
   only as instruments of the divine action, which has power to
   communicate His grace, and often does communicate it to simple souls in
   ways and by means which seem opposed to the end intended. It enlightens
   through mud as well as through glass, and the instrument of which it
   makes use is always singular. To it everything is alike. Faith always
   believes that nothing is wanting to it, and never complains of the
   privation of means which might prove useful for its increase, because
   the Workman, who employs them efficaciously, supplies what is wanting
   by His action. The divine action is the whole virtue of the creature.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION V.--Nature and Grace the Instruments of God.

   The less capable the soul in the state of abandonment is of defending
   itself, the more powerfully does God defend it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The one and infallible influence of the divine action is invariably
   applied to the submissive soul at an opportune moment, and this soul
   corresponds in everything to its interior direction. It is pleased with
   everything that has taken place, with everything that is happening, and
   with all that affects it, with the exception of sin. Sometimes the soul
   acts with full consciousness, sometimes unknowingly, being led only by
   obscure instincts to say, to do, or to leave certain things, without
   being able to give a reason for its action.

   Often the occasion and the determining reason are only of the natural
   order; the soul, perceiving no sort of mystery therein, acts by pure
   chance, necessity, or convenience, and its act has no other aspect
   either in its own eyes, or those of others; while all the time the
   divine action, through the intellect, the wisdom, or the counsel of
   friends, makes use of the simplest things in its favour. It makes them
   its own, and opposes so persistently every effort prejudicial to them,
   that it becomes impossible that these should succeed.

   To have to deal with a simple soul is, in a certain way, to have to
   deal with God. What can be done against the will of the Almighty and
   His inscrutable designs? God takes the cause of the simple soul in
   hand. It is unnecessary for it to study the intrigues of others, to
   trouble about their worries, or to scrutinize their conduct; its Spouse
   relieves it of all these anxieties, and it can repose in Him full of
   peace, and in security.

   The divine action frees and exempts the soul from all those low and
   noisy ways so necessary to human prudence. These suited Herod and the
   Pharisees, but the Magi had only to follow their star in peace. The
   child has but to rest in His Mother's arms. His enemies do more to
   advance His interests than to hinder His work. The greater efforts they
   exert to thwart, and to take Him unawares, the more freely and
   tranquilly does He act. He never humours them, nor basely truckles to
   them to make them turn aside their blows; their jealousies, suspicions,
   and persecutions are necessary to Him. Thus did Jesus Christ live in
   Judea, and thus does He live now in simple souls. In them He is
   generous, sweet, free, peaceful, fearless, needing no one, beholding
   all creatures in His Father's hands, and obliged to serve Him, some by
   their criminal passions, others by their holy actions; the former by
   their contradictions, the latter by their obedience and submission. The
   divine action balances all this in a wonderful manner, nothing is
   wanting nor is anything superfluous, but of good and evil there is only
   what is necessary. The will of God applies, at each moment, the proper
   means to the end in view, and the simple soul, instructed by faith,
   finds everything right, and desires neither more nor less than what it
   has. It ever blesses that divine hand which so well apportions the
   means, and turns every obstacle aside. It receives friends and enemies
   with the same patient courtesy with which Jesus treated everyone, and
   as divine instruments. It has need of no one and yet needs all. The
   divine action renders all necessary, and all must be received from it,
   according to their quality and nature, and corresponded to with
   sweetness and humility; the simple treated simply, and the unpolished
   kindly. This is what St Paul teaches, and what Jesus Christ practised
   most perfectly.

   Only grace can impress this supernatural character, which is
   appropriate to, and adapts itself to each person. This is never learnt
   from books, but from a true prophetic spirit, and is the effect of a
   special inspiration, and a doctrine of the Holy Spirit. To understand
   it one must be in the highest state of abandonment, the most perfect
   freedom from all design, and from all interests, however holy. One must
   have in view the only serious business in the world, that of following
   submissively the divine action. To do this one must apply oneself to
   the fulfilling of the obligations of one's state; and allow the Holy
   Spirit to act interiorly without trying to understand His operations,
   but even being pleased to be kept in ignorance about them. Then one is
   safe, for all that happens in the world can work nothing but good for
   souls perfectly submissive to the will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VI.--Supernatural Prudence.

   The soul, in the state of abandonment, does not fear its enemies, but
   finds in them useful helps.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I fear more my own action and that of my friends than that of my
   enemies. There is no prudence so great as that which offers no
   resistance to enemies, and which opposes to them only a simple
   abandonment. This is to run before the wind, and as there is nothing
   else to be done, to keep quiet and peaceful. There is nothing that is
   more entirely opposed to worldly prudence than simplicity; it turns
   aside all schemes without comprehending them, without so much as a
   thought about them. The divine action makes the soul take such just
   measures as to surprise those who want to take it by surprise
   themselves. It profits by all their efforts, and is raised by the very
   things that are done to lower it. They are the galley slaves who bring
   the ship into port with hard rowing. All obstacles turn to the good of
   this soul, and by allowing its enemies a free hand, it obtains a
   continual service, so sufficing that all it has to fear is lest it
   should itself take part in a work of which God would be principal, and
   His enemies the agents, and in which it has nothing to do but to
   peacefully observe the work of God, and to follow with simplicity the
   attractions He gives it. The supernatural prudence of the Divine
   Spirit, the principle of these attractions, infallibly attains its end;
   and the precise circumstances of each event are so applied to the soul,
   without its perception, that everything opposed to them cannot fail to
   be destroyed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VII.--Conviction of Weakness.

   The soul in the state of abandonment can abstain from justifying itself
   by word or deed. The divine action justifies it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This order of the divine will is the solid and firm rock on which the
   submissive soul reposes, sheltered from change and tempest. It is
   continually present under the veil of crosses, and of the most ordinary
   actions. Behind this veil the hand of God is hidden to sustain and to
   support those who abandon themselves entirely to Him. From the time
   that a soul becomes firmly established in abandonment, it will be
   protected from the opposition of talkers, for it need not ever say or
   do anything in self-defence. Since the work is of God, justification
   must never be sought elsewhere. Its effects and its consequences are
   justification enough. There is nothing but to let it develop "Dies diei
   eructat verbum"; "Day to day uttereth speech" (Ps. xviii, 3). When one
   is no longer guided by reflexion, words must no longer be used in
   self-defence. Our words can only express our thoughts; where no ideas
   are supposed to exist, words cannot be used. Of what use would they be?
   To give a satisfactory explanation of our conduct? But we cannot
   explain that of which we know nothing for it is hidden in the principle
   of our actions, and we have experienced nothing but an impression, and
   that in an ineffable manner. We must, therefore, let the results
   justify their principles.

   All the links of this divine chain remain firm and solid, and the
   reason of that which precedes as cause is seen in that which follows as
   effect. It is no longer a life of dreams, a life of imaginations, a
   life of a multiplicity of words. The soul is no longer occupied with
   these things, nor nourished and maintained in this way; they are no
   longer of any avail, and afford no support.

   The soul no longer sees where it is going, nor foresees where it will
   go; reflexions no longer help it to gain courage to endure fatigue, and
   to sustain the hardships of the way. All this is swept aside by an
   interior conviction of weakness. The road widens as it advances; it has
   started, and goes on without hesitation. Being perfectly simple and
   straightforward, it follows the path of God's commandments quietly,
   relying on God Himself whom it finds at every step, and God, whom it
   seeks above all things, takes upon Himself to manifest His presence in
   such a way as to avenge it on its unjust detractors.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION VIII.--Self-guidance a Mistake.

   God imparts to the soul in the state of abandonment by means which seem
   more likely to destroy it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is a time when God would be the life of the soul, and Himself
   accomplish its perfection in secret and unknown ways. Then all its own
   ideas, lights, industries, examinations, and reasonings become sources
   of illusion. After many experiences of the sad consequences of
   self-guidance, the soul recognising its uselessness, and finding that
   God has hidden and confused all the issues, is forced to fly to Him to
   find life. Then, convinced of its nothingness and of the harmfulness of
   all that it derives from itself, it abandons itself to God to gain all
   from Him. It is then that God becomes the source of its life, not by
   means of ideas, lights, or reflexions, for all this is no longer
   anything to it but a source of illusion; but in reality, and by His
   grace, which is hidden under the strangest appearances.

   The divine operation, unknown to the soul, communicates its virtue and
   substance by many circumstances that the soul believes will be its
   destruction. There is no cure for this ignorance, it must be allowed
   its course. God gives Himself therein, and with Himself, he gives all
   things in the obscurity of faith. The soul is but a blind subject, or,
   in other words, it is like a sick person who knows nothing of the
   properties of remedies and tastes only their bitterness. He often
   imagines that what is given him will be his death; the pain and
   weakness which result seem to justify his fears; nevertheless it is
   under the semblance of death that his health is restored, and he takes
   the medicines on the word of the physician. In the same way the
   submissive soul is in no way pre-occupied about its infirmities, except
   as regards obvious maladies which by their nature compel it to rest;
   and to take suitable remedies. The languor and weakness of souls in the
   state of abandonment are only illusory appearances which they ought to
   defy with confidence. God sends them, or permits them in order to give
   opportunities for the exercise of faith and abandonment which are the
   true remedies. Without paying the least attention to them, these souls
   should generously pursue their way, following by their actions and
   sufferings the order of God, making use without hesitation of the body
   as though it were a horse on hire, which is intended to be driven until
   it is worn out. This is better than thinking of health so much as to
   harm the soul.

   A courageous spirit does much to maintain a feeble body, and one year
   of a life spent in so noble and generous a manner is of more value than
   would be a century of care-taking and nervous fears. One ought to be
   able to show outwardly that one is in a state of grace and goodwill.
   What is there to be afraid of in fulfilling the divine will? The
   conduct of one who is upheld and sustained by it should show nothing
   exteriorly but what is heroic. The terrifying experiences that have to
   be encountered are really nothing. They are only sent that life may be
   adorned with more glorious victories. The divine will involves the soul
   in troubles of every kind, where human prudence can neither see nor
   imagine any outlet. It then feels all its weakness, and, finding out
   its shortcomings, is confounded. The divine will then asserts itself in
   all its power to those who give themselves to it without reserve. It
   succours them more marvellously than the writers of fiction, in the
   fertility of their imagination, unravel the intrigues and perils of
   their imaginary heroes, and bring them to a happy end. With a much more
   admirable skill, and much more happily, does the divine will guide the
   soul through deadly perils and monsters, even through the fires of hell
   with their demons and sufferings. It raises souls to the heights of
   heaven, and makes them the subjects of histories both real and
   mystical, more beautiful, and more extraordinary than any invented by
   the vain imagination of man.

   On then, my soul, through perils and monsters, guided and sustained by
   that mighty invisible hand of divine Providence. On, without fear, to
   the end, in peace and joy, and make all the incidents of life occasions
   of fresh victories. We march under His Standard, to fight and to
   conquer; "exivit vincens ut vinceret"; "He went forth conquering that
   he might conquer" (Apocal. vi, 2).

   As many steps as we take under His command will be the triumphs we
   gain. The Holy Spirit of God writes in an open book this sacred history
   which is not yet finished, nor will be till the end of the world. This
   history contains an account of the guidance and designs of God with
   regard to men. It remains for us to figure in this history, and to
   continue the thread of it by the union of our actions and sufferings
   with His will. No! It is not to cause the loss of our souls that we
   have so much to do, and to suffer; but that we may furnish matter for
   that holy writing which is added to day by day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION IX.--Divine Love, the Principle of All Good.

   To those who follow this path, divine love is all-sufficing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   While despoiling of all things those souls who give themselves entirely
   to Him, God gives them something in place of them. Instead of light,
   wisdom, life, and strength, He gives them His love. The divine love in
   these souls is like a supernatural instinct. In nature, each thing
   contains that which is suitable to its kind. Each flower has its
   special beauty, each animal its instinct, and each creature its
   perfection. Also in the different states of grace, each has a special
   grace. This is the recompense for everyone who accepts with goodwill
   the state in which he is placed by Providence. A soul comes under the
   divine action from the moment that a habit of goodwill is formed within
   it, and this action influences it more or less according to its degree
   of abandonment. The whole art of abandonment is simply that of loving,
   and the divine action is nothing else than the action of divine love.
   How can it be that these two loves seeking each other should do
   otherwise than unite when they meet? How can the divine love refuse
   aught to a soul whose every desire it directs? And how can a soul that
   lives only for Him refuse Him anything? Love can refuse nothing that
   love desires, nor desire anything that love refuses. The divine action
   regards only the goodwill; the capability of the other faculties does
   not attract it, nor does the want of capability repel it. All that it
   requires is a heart that is good, pure, just, simple, submissive,
   filial, and respectful. It takes possession of such a heart, and of all
   its faculties, and so arranges everything for its benefit that it finds
   in all things its sanctification. That which destroys other souls would
   find in this soul an antidote of goodwill which would nullify its
   poison. Even at the edge of a precipice the divine action would draw it
   back, or even if it were allowed to remain there it would prevent it
   from falling; and if it fell, it would rescue it. After all, the faults
   of such a soul are only faults of frailty; love takes but little notice
   of them, and well knows how to turn them to advantage. It makes the
   soul understand by secret suggestions what it ought to say, or to do,
   according to circumstances. These suggestions it receives as rays of
   light from the divine understanding: "intellectus bonus omnibus
   facientibus eum"; "A good understanding to all that do it" (Ps. cx,
   10), for this divine understanding accompanies such souls step by step,
   and prevents them taking those false steps which their simplicity
   encourages. If they make arrangements which would involve them in some
   promise prejudicial to them, divine Providence arranges some fortunate
   occurrence which rectifies everything. In vain are schemes formed
   against them repeatedly; divine Providence cuts all the knots, brings
   the authors to confusion, and so turns their heads as to make them fall
   into their own trap. Under its guidance those souls that they wish to
   take by surprise do certain things that seem very useless at the time,
   but that serve afterwards to deliver them from all the troubles into
   which their uprightness and the malice of their enemies would have
   plunged them. Oh! what good policy it is to have goodwill! What
   prudence there is in simplicity! What ability in its innocence and
   candour! What mysteries and secrets in its straightforwardness! Look at
   the youthful Tobias; he is but a lad, yet with what confidence he
   proceeds, having the archangel Raphael for his guide. Nothing frightens
   him, nothing is wanting to him. The very monsters he encounters furnish
   him with food and remedies; the one that rushes forward to devour him
   becomes itself his sustenance. By the order of Providence he has
   nothing to attend to but feasts and weddings, everything else is left
   to the management of the guiding spirit appointed to help him. These
   things are so well managed that never before have they been so
   successful, nor so blessed and prosperous. However, his mother weeps,
   and is in great distress at his supposed loss, but his father remains
   full of faith. The son, so bitterly mourned returns to rejoice his
   family and to share their happiness.

   Divine love then, is to those who give themselves up to it without
   reserve, the principle of all good. To acquire this inestimable
   treasure the only thing necessary is greatly to desire it. Yes, God
   only asks for love, and if you seek this treasure, this kingdom in
   which God reigns alone, you will find it. If your heart is entirely
   devoted to God, it is itself, for that very reason, the treasure and
   the kingdom that you seek and desire. From the time that one desires
   God and His holy will, one enjoys God and His will, and this enjoyment
   corresponds to the ardour of the desire. To desire to love God is truly
   to love Him, and because we love Him we wish to become instruments of
   His action in order that His love may be exercised in, and by us. The
   divine action does not correspond to the aims of a saintly and simple
   soul, nor to the steps it takes, nor to the projects it forms, nor to
   the manner in which it reflects, nor to the means it chooses, nor to
   the purity of its intention. It often happens that the soul can be
   deceived in all this, but its good intention and uprightness can never
   deceive it. Provided that God perceives in it a good intention, He can
   dispense with all the rest, and He holds as done for Him what it will
   eventually do when truer ideas second its goodwill.

   Goodwill, therefore, has nothing to fear. If it fall, it can only do so
   under the almighty hand which guides and sustains it in all its
   wanderings. It is this divine hand which turns it again to face the
   goal from which it has strayed; which replaces it in the right path
   when it has wandered. In it the soul finds resources for the deviations
   to which the blind faculties which deceive it, render it subject. It is
   made to feel how much it ought to despise them, and to rely on God
   alone, abandoning itself absolutely to His infallible guidance. The
   failings into which good souls fall are put an end to by abandonment.
   Never can goodwill be taken unawares. That all things work for its good
   is an article of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION X.--We Must see God in all His Creatures.

   In the state of abandonment the soul finds more light and strength,
   through submission to the divine action, than all those possess who
   resist it through pride.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of what use are the most sublime illuminations, the most divine
   revelations, if one has no love for the will of God? It was because of
   this that Lucifer fell. The ruling of the divine action revealed to him
   by God, in showing him the mystery of the Incarnation, produced in him
   nothing but envy.

   On the other hand a simple soul, enlightened only by faith, can never
   tire of admiring, praising, and loving the order of God; of finding it
   not only in holy creatures, but even in the most irregular confusion
   and disorder. One grain of pure faith will give more light to a simple
   soul than Lucifer received in his highest intelligence. The devotion of
   the faithful soul to its obligations; its quiet submission to the
   intimate promptings of grace; its gentleness and humility towards
   everyone; are of more value than the most profound insight into
   mysteries. If one regarded only the divine action in all the pride and
   harshness of creatures, one would never treat them with anything but
   sweetness and respect. Their roughness would never disturb the divine
   order, whatever course it might take. One must only see in it the
   divine action, given and taken, as long as one is faithful in the
   practice of sweetness and humility. It is best not to observe their way
   of proceeding, but always to walk with firm steps in our own path. It
   is thus that by bending gently, cedars are broken, and rocks
   overthrown. Who amongst creatures can resist a faithful, gentle, and
   humble soul? These are the only arms to be taken if we wish to conquer
   all our enemies. Jesus Christ has placed them in our hands that we may
   defend ourselves; there is nothing to fear if we know how to use them.

   We must not be cowardly, but generous. This is the only disposition
   suitable to the instruments of God.

   All the works of God are sublime and marvellous; while one's own
   actions, when they war against God, cannot resist the divine action in
   one who is united to it by sweetness and humility.

   Who is Lucifer? He is a pure spirit, and was the most enlightened of
   all pure spirits, but is now at war with God and with His rule. The
   mystery of sin is merely the result of this conflict, which manifests
   itself in every possible way. Lucifer, as much as in him lies, will
   leave no stone upturned to destroy what God has made and ordered.
   Wherever he enters, there is the work of God defaced. The more light,
   science, and capacity a person has, the more he is to be feared if he
   does not possess a foundation of piety, which consists in being
   satisfied with God and His will. It is by a well-regulated heart that
   one is united to the divine action; without this everything is purely
   natural, and generally, in direct opposition to the divine order. God
   makes use only of the humble as His instruments. Always contradicted by
   the proud, He yet makes use of them, like slaves, for the
   accomplishment of His designs.

   When I find a soul which does all for God alone, and in submission to
   His order, however wanting it may be in all things else, I say "This is
   a soul with a great aptitude for serving God." The holy Virgin and St.
   Joseph were like this. All else without these qualities makes me fear.
   I am afraid to see in it the action of Lucifer. I remain on my guard,
   and shut myself up in my foundation of simplicity, in opposition to all
   this outward glitter which, by itself, is nothing to me but a bit of
   broken glass.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION XI.--The Strength of Simplicity.

   The soul in the state of abandonment knows how to see God even in the
   proud who oppose His action. All creatures, good or evil, reveal Him to
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The whole practice of the simple soul is in the accomplishment of the
   will of God. This it respects even in those unruly actions by which the
   proud attempt to depreciate it. The proud soul despises one in whose
   sight it is as nothing, who beholds only God in it, and in all its
   actions. Often it imagines that the modesty of the simple soul is a
   mark of appreciation for itself; when, all the time, it is only a sign
   of that loving fear of God and of His holy will as shown to it in the
   person of the proud. No, poor fool, the simple soul fears you not at
   all. You excite its compassion; it is answering God when you think it
   is speaking to you: it is with Him that it believes it has to do; it
   regards you only as one of His slaves, or rather as a mask with which
   He disguises Himself. Therefore the more you take a high tone, the
   lower you become in its estimation; and when you think to take it by
   surprise, it surprises you. Your wiles and violence are just favours
   from Heaven.

   The proud soul cannot comprehend itself, but the simple soul, with the
   light of faith, can very clearly see through it.

   The finding of the divine action in all that occurs at each moment, in
   and around us, is true science, a continuous revelation of truth, and
   an unceasingly renewed intercourse with God. It is a rejoicing with the
   Spouse, not in secret, nor by stealth, in the cellar, or the vineyard,
   but openly, and in public, without any human respect. It is a fund of
   peace, of joy, of love, and of satisfaction with God who is seen,
   known, or rather, believed in, living and operating in the most perfect
   manner in everything that happens. It is the beginning of eternal
   happiness not yet perfectly realised and tasted, except in an
   incomplete and hidden manner.

   The Holy Spirit, who arranges all the pieces on the board of life,
   will, by this fruitful and continual presence of His action, say at the
   hour of death, "fiat lux," "let there be light" (Gen. i, 14), and then
   will be seen the treasures which faith hides in this abyss of peace and
   contentment with God, and which will be found in those things that have
   been every moment done, or suffered for Him.

   When God gives Himself thus, all that is common becomes wonderful; and
   it is on this account that nothing seems to be so, because this way is,
   in itself, extraordinary. Consequently it is unnecessary to make it
   full of strange and unsuitable marvels. It is, in itself, a miracle, a
   revelation, a constant joy even with the prevalence of minor faults.
   But it is a miracle which, while rendering all common and sensible
   things wonderful, has nothing in itself that is sensibly marvellous.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION XII.--The Triumph of Humility.

   To the souls which are faithful to Him, God promises a glorious victory
   over the powers of the world and of hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If the divine action is hidden here below under the appearance of
   weakness, it is in order to increase the merit of souls which are
   faithful to it; but its triumph is none the less certain.

   The history of the world from the beginning is but the history of the
   struggle between the powers of the world, and of hell, against the
   souls which are humbly devoted to the divine action. In this struggle
   all the advantage seems to be on the side of pride, yet the victory
   always remains with humility. The image of the world is always
   presented to our eyes as a statue of gold, brass, iron, and clay. This
   mystery of iniquity, shown in a dream to Nabuchodonosor, is nothing but
   a confused medley of all the actions, interior and exterior, of the
   children of darkness. This is also typified by the beast coming out of
   the pit to make war, from the beginning of time, against the interior
   and spiritual life of man. All that takes place in our days is the
   consequence of this war. Monster follows monster out of the pit, which
   swallows, and vomits them forth again amidst incessant clouds of smoke.
   The combat between St. Michael and Lucifer, that began in Heaven, still
   continues. The heart of this once magnificent angel, has become,
   through envy, an inexhaustible abyss of every kind of evil. He made
   angel revolt against angel in Heaven, and from the creation of the
   world his whole energy is exerted to make more criminals among men to
   fill the ranks of those who have been swallowed up in the pit. Lucifer
   is the chief of those who refuse obedience to the Almighty. This
   mystery of iniquity is the very inversion of the order of God; it is
   the order, or rather, the disorder of the devil.

   This disorder is a mystery because, under a false appearance of good,
   it hides irremediable and infinite evil. Every wicked man, who, from
   the time of Cain, up to the present moment, has declared war against
   God, has outwardly been great and powerful, making a great stir in the
   world, and being worshiped by all. But this outward semblance is a
   mystery. In reality they are beasts which have ascended from the pit
   one after another to overthrow the order of God. But this order, which
   is another mystery, has always opposed to them really great and
   powerful men who have dealt these monsters a mortal wound. As fast as
   hell vomits them forth, Heaven at the same time creates fresh heroes to
   combat them. Ancient history, sacred and profane, is but a record of
   this war. The order of God has ever remained victorious and those who
   have ranged themselves on the side of God have shared His triumph, and
   are happy for all eternity. Injustice has never been able to protect
   deserters. It can reward them only by death, an eternal death.

   Those who practise iniquity imagine themselves invincible. O God! who
   can resist You? If a single soul has the whole world and all hell
   against it, it need have no fear if, by abandonment, it takes its stand
   on the side of God and His order.

   The monstrous spectacle of wickedness armed with so much power, the
   head of gold, the body of silver, brass, and iron, is nothing more than
   the image of clay; a small stone cast at it will scatter it to the four
   winds of Heaven.

   How wonderfully has the Holy Spirit illustrated the centuries of the
   world! So many startling revelations! so many renowned heroes following
   each other like so many brilliant stars! So many wonderful events!

   All this is like the dream of Nabuchodonosor, forgotten on awaking,
   however terrible the impression it made at the time.

   All these monsters only come into the world to exercise the courage of
   the children of God, and if these are well trained, God gives them the
   pleasure of slaying the monsters, and sends fresh athletes into the
   arena.

   And this life is a spectacle to angels, causing continual joy in
   Heaven, work for saints on earth, and confusion to the devils in hell.

   So all that is opposed to the order of God renders it only the more to
   be adored. All workers of iniquity are slaves of justice, and the
   divine action builds the heavenly Jerusalem on the ruins of Babylon.

SPIRITUAL COUNSELS OF FR. DE CAUSSADE
     __________________________________________________________________

  I.--Conformity to the Will of God.

   Written in 1731 to Sister Marie-Thérèse de Voiménil, in the 9th year of
   her profession, and the 28th of her age.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For the attainment of perfect conformity to the will of God.

   1st. At the beginning of each day, and of meditation, Mass, and
   Communion, declare to God that you desire to belong to Him entirely,
   and that you will devote yourself wholly to acquiring the spirit of
   prayer and of the interior life.

   2nd. Make it your chief study to conform yourself to the will of God
   even in the smallest things, saying in the midst of the most annoying
   contradictions and with the most alarming prospects for the future: "My
   God, I desire with all my heart to do Your holy will, I submit in all
   things and absolutely to Your good pleasure for time and eternity; and
   I wish to do this, Oh my God, for two reasons; first: because You are
   my Sovereign Lord and it is but just that Your will should be
   accomplished; secondly: because I am convinced by faith, and by
   experience that Your will is in all things as good and beneficent as it
   is just and adorable, while my own desires are always blind and
   corrupt; blind, because I know not what I ought to desire or to avoid;
   corrupt, because I nearly always long for what would do me harm.
   Therefore, from henceforth, I renounce my own will to follow Yours in
   all things; dispose of me, Oh my God, according to Your good will and
   pleasure."

   3rd. This continual practice of submission will preserve that interior
   peace which is the foundation of the spiritual life, and will prevent
   you from worrying about your faults and failings. You will put up with
   them instead, with a humble and quiet submission which is more likely
   to cure them than an uneasy distress, only calculated to weaken and
   discourage you.

   4th. Think no more about the past but only of the present and future.
   Do not trouble about your confessions, but accuse yourself simply of
   those faults you can remember after seven or eight minutes examen. It
   is a good thing to add to the accusation a more serious sin of your
   past life. This will cause you to make a more fervent act of contrition
   and dispose you to receive more abundantly the grace of the Sacrament.
   You should not make too many efforts to get rid of the obstacles which
   make frequent confession disagreeable to you.

   5th. To escape the distress caused by regret for the past or fear about
   the future, this is the rule to follow: leave the past to the infinite
   mercy of God, the future to His good Providence, give the present
   wholly to His love by being faithful to His grace.

   6th. When God in His goodness sends you some disappointment, one of
   those trials that used to annoy you so much; before all thank Him for
   it as for a great favour all the more useful for the great work of your
   perfection in that it completely overturns the work of the moment.

   7th. Try, in spite of interior dislike, to show a kind face to
   troublesome people, or to those who come to chatter about their
   troubles; leave at once prayer, reading, choir office, in fact
   anything, to go where Providence calls you; and do what is asked of you
   quietly, peacefully, without hurry, and without vexation.

   8th. Should you fail in any of these points, make immediately an act of
   interior humility--not that sort of humility full of uneasiness and
   irritation against which St. Francis of Sales said so much, but a
   humility that is gentle, peaceful, and sweet. This is a matter
   essential for overcoming your self-will, and to prevent you becoming a
   slave to your exterior or interior devotion.

   9th. We must understand that we can never acquire true conformity to
   the will of God until we are perfectly resolved to serve Him according
   to His will and pleasure and not to please ourselves. In everything
   look to God, and you will find Him everywhere, but more especially
   where you have most completely renounced yourself. When you are
   thoroughly convinced that of yourself you are incapable of doing any
   good, you will give up making resolutions but will humbly confess to
   God: "My God, I acknowledge after many trials that all my resolutions
   are useless. Doubtless I have hitherto depended too much on myself, but
   You have abased me. You alone can do all things; make me then, do such
   and such a thing, and give me, when necessary, the recollection, energy
   and strength of will that I require. Without this, I know from my
   former sad experiences, I shall never do anything."

   10th. To this humble prayer add the practice of begging pardon at once
   or as soon as possible of all those who witnessed any of your little
   impetuosities or outbursts of temper. It is most important for you to
   practise these counsels for two reasons: first, because God desires to
   do everything in you Himself; secondly, on account of a secret
   presumption, which, even in the midst of so many miseries, prevents you
   referring everything to God, until you have experienced a thousand
   times how absolutely incapable you are of performing any good. When you
   become thoroughly convinced of this truth you will exclaim almost
   without reflexion, when you act rightly, "Oh my God it is You who do
   this in me by your grace." And when You do wrong: "This is just like
   me! I see myself as I am." Then will God be glorified in all your
   actions, because He will be proved to be the sole author of all that is
   good. This is your path; all the misery and humiliation you must take
   on yourself, and render to God the glory and thanks that are His due.
   All the glory to Him, but all the profit to you. You would be very
   foolish not to accept with gratitude a share so just and so
   advantageous.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II.--Counsel for Outward Behaviour.

   Counsel for the outward behaviour of one called to the life of
   abandonment. Addressed to Sister Charlotte Elizabeth Bourcier de
   Monthureux.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When you wake raise your soul to God, realising His divine presence;
   adore the Blessed Trinity, imitating the great St. Francis Xavier, "I
   adore You, God the Father, who created me, I adore You, God the Son,
   who redeemed me, I adore You, God the Holy Ghost who have sanctified
   me, and continue to carry on the work of my sanctification. I
   consecrate this day entirely to Your love and to Your greater glory. I
   know not what this day will bring me either pleasant or troublesome,
   whether I shall be happy or sorrowful, shall enjoy consolation or
   undergo pain and grief, it shall be as You please; I give myself into
   Your hands and submit myself to whatever You will."

   Fix your attention on what strikes you at the beginning of the day and
   on that with which grace inspires you more particularly in the interior
   of your soul, keeping it before you quietly. Begin your prayer with it,
   then give yourself up completely to the Spirit of God and remain thus
   for as long as He pleases. Imitate the good woman who exclaimed, "My
   God, if You will not give me bread, at any rate give me patience."

   Those who practise ordinary prayer in which the intellect is exercised
   should remember the subject of meditation prepared overnight, because
   if the mind is allowed to wander to all sorts of subjects, then the
   whole day will be out of order as a clock not set correctly at first
   will go wrong all day.

   For the toilet, do all that is necessary, then think no more about it.

   The way to hear holy Mass worthily is to represent to yourself the
   mystery of the Cross. Ascend Mount Calvary in spirit, and contemplate
   what takes place there as though you actually saw it. Admire first the
   justice of God who punishes His only Son for the sins of men of which
   He took on Himself the semblance and for which He had offered Himself
   as the atonement. Secondly, the greatness of God to whom such a
   reparation was due. Thirdly, the value of our souls reclaimed at such a
   price; fourthly the eternal happiness that Jesus Christ has merited for
   us and the eternal torments from which He has delivered us. Reflexions
   on these divine subjects should fill our souls with faith, hope,
   humility, compunction, gratitude and love. Those who cannot keep their
   minds steadfastly fixed on such high subjects should address themselves
   to the Blessed Virgin, who was present at this mystery, or to St. John,
   St. Mary Magdalen and the good Thief, and finally to our Lord Himself
   in token of their piety, and to give Him the honour due to Him on
   account of the excess of His immense and incomprehensible charity and
   mercy.

   I have only two things to say on the subject of prayer. Make it with
   absolute compliance with the will of God, no matter whether it be
   successful, or you are troubled with dryness, distractions, or other
   obstacles. If it is easy and full of consolations, return thanks to God
   without dwelling on the pleasure it has caused you; if it has not
   succeeded submit to God, humbling yourself and go away contented and in
   peace even if it should have failed through your own fault; redoubling
   your confidence and resignation to His holy will. Persevere in this way
   and sooner or later God will give you grace to pray properly; but
   whatever trials you may have to endure never allow yourself to be
   discouraged. As to the Office, there are three ways of saying it,
   equally easy and solid. The first is to keep yourself in the presence
   of God and to say the Office with great recollection in union with Him,
   occasionally raising your mind and heart to Him. Those who can say it
   thus need not trouble to alter their method. The second way is to
   attend to the words in union with the mind of the Church, praying as
   she prays, sighing when she sighs, and deriving all the instruction
   from it; praising, adoring, thanking, according to the different
   meanings of the verses we are pronouncing. The third way is to reflect
   humbly that you are actually united to holy souls in praising God and
   in desiring to share their holy dispositions. You should prostrate
   yourself in spirit at their feet, believing that they are much more
   full of piety and fervour than yourself. These feelings are very
   pleasing to His divine Majesty, and we cannot be too deeply impressed
   with them. With regard to confession, be firmly convinced that you need
   not trouble about it, either on account of your miseries or of your
   sins. St. Francis of Sales says that after sorrow for sin there should
   be peace. This then is what you ought to aim at, and above all you
   should be full of great confidence in the infinite goodness of God,
   remembering that His mercy is greater than any of His works, that He
   glories in forgiving us, but cannot prove His generosity if we are
   wanting in confidence. He loves simplicity, candour, and uprightness,
   go to Him therefore with perfect confidence, in spite of all your
   weakness, misery and unfaithfulness. That will win His heart, and He
   will forgive everything to those who trust in His goodness and love.

   Do not spend more than half-an-hour over your preparation. More than
   that would be waste of time, and would give the devil an opportunity to
   create trouble in your soul. This must be avoided more than anything,
   for peace of mind is a tree of life, the true root of the interior
   spirit, and the best preparation for the prayer of recollection and
   interior silence. The first quarter of an hour at the most can be
   occupied with the remembrance of your faults, all those that you forget
   after this examen will be as if non-existent, and you will be forgiven.
   The last quarter of an hour should be employed in exciting yourself to
   contrition, begging this grace from God, and endeavouring to obtain it
   quietly and without any effort of the mind, by the thought of the
   goodness of God and the great mercy He has shown you in withdrawing you
   from the world, where you would have been lost, and calling you to the
   religious life in which you can so easily save your soul; or, by
   preserving you from dying in a state of sin; or, by reclaiming you from
   a tepid, feeble and imperfect life, in which you ran the risk of being
   lost, even in the religious state.

   After reflecting for some moments in this way you should think that
   contrition being purely spiritual is, by nature, not sensibly felt, and
   that sensible sorrow is so misleading that certain sinners, in spite of
   every sign, are refused absolution, because it is possible that a habit
   of sin--even of mortal sin to which the will consents, may subsist with
   it. The surest sign of true sorrow for which the greatest sinner will
   receive absolution is, to resolve by the grace of God never to commit
   these great sins again. Then say from the bottom of your heart: "Lord!
   I hope You have given me the necessary contrition. I hereby ask Your
   pardon for all the sins I have committed; I detest them with all my
   heart because of the hatred You bear them. You see, my God, that I am
   truly sorry, not only for having committed them, but also because I am
   unable to feel all the sorrow I wish to have. You conceal this sorrow
   from me even in giving it, so that I may never be certain of having
   been pardoned, nor of being in a state of grace. It pleases You to keep
   me in this humble dependence in order to give occasion for faith and
   holy hope, the way by which You would conduct me. I am compelled to be
   satisfied with the remembrance of Your great mercy, and in it I will
   lose myself, and to it I will blindly abandon myself, fully and without
   reserve; and I will do so, Oh my God! with all my heart. Yes, Lord, I
   will rest willingly on You alone, accepting this state of uncertainty
   that is so terrible and in which all are kept, even the greatest saints
   and the souls most dear to You."

   As regards the declaration of your sins; tell those that you recollect
   simply and in as few words as possible, leaving the rest to the
   unbounded mercy of God without troubling about what you do not
   remember, or do not know. You can conclude by mentioning some greater
   sin of your past life. After that you may feel morally certain that you
   have received the grace of the Sacrament. The following is an easy way
   of practising frequent confession. To prevent more certainly all
   anxiety about the past and as a help for the future here is a counsel
   in a few words. Leave the past to the infinite mercy of God--the future
   to His sweet providence, and the present give up entirely to the love
   of God by our fidelity with the assistance of His grace, which will
   never fail you, except by your own fault.

   While receiving absolution let this thought preoccupy you and, throwing
   yourself in spirit at the foot of the Cross, kiss the wounds in our
   Lord's sacred feet saying "Oh I my God! I ask but for one drop of that
   most precious and adorable Blood that You shed for my salvation. In
   Your goodness let it fall upon my sinful soul to cleanse it more and
   more from all its stains, and above all, from the grievous sins of my
   past life for which I very humbly ask pardon. I have a sure hope of
   obtaining it from that very great mercy You have so often shown to this
   miserable and vile creature." This done, I forbid you in the name of
   God, to think, voluntarily, any more either of the confession you have
   just made, of your sins, or of contrition in order to find out if you
   have been forgiven and are restored to grace.

   This is a mystery known only to God, and one which He keeps to Himself;
   and the devil makes use of it to disturb and trouble souls in order to
   make them waste time, and to deprive them of that sweet interior peace,
   which is the best disposition for communion, and without which they can
   derive little fruit from that heavenly feast. In such a state of
   anxiety and distress it is difficult to have any desire for this divine
   food; it is even distasteful to us through our own fault, because,
   instead of rejecting and despising these foolish anxieties into which
   the evil one has thrown our souls we permit ourselves to be harassed
   and afflicted by them. Let them fall as a stone falls into the sea.

   For Holy Communion these two points will suffice: before Communion let
   us act like Martha, and after like Mary,--that is to say we should
   prepare ourselves by fervent acts of virtue and of the good works
   adapted to our state, without uneasiness and without over-eagerness,
   and then reflect on Jesus Christ, on His infinite merits and love and
   remain united to Him in an ineffable peace, transcending all feeling.

   Nature seeks self in everything, even in exercises of piety and virtue
   as well as in those actions prescribed by the necessities of this life.
   It was on this account that the saints sighed continually and were
   ceaselessly on their guard, looking upon themselves as their own
   greatest enemies. We should be particularly careful as regards those
   things for which we have an attachment and be ready to sacrifice
   anything that gives us pleasure to comply with the lawful demands of
   our neighbour, especially where the matter is one of obedience. The
   will of God should always prevail over our own desires however holy
   they seem to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III.--Interior Direction.

   Method of interior direction, addressed to the same Sister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. We attain to God by the annihilation of self. Let us abase
   ourselves till there is nothing of self to be perceived.

   2nd. In the degree in which we banish all that is not God, we shall
   become filled with God, because where we no longer find self we shall
   find God. The greatest good we can do for our souls in this life is to
   fill them with God.

   3rd. The practice of complete abnegation consists in having no other
   care but that of dying entirely to self to make room for God to live
   and work in us.

   4th. The most excellent act of which we are capable, and one which in
   itself contains all other virtues, is to resign ourselves entirely to
   God by a total self-renunciation, and to lose self in the abyss of our
   own nothingness to find it no more save in God. This is the one thing
   necessary recommended by our Lord in the Gospel. Oh! the riches of
   nothingness! Why are you not known? The more completely a soul
   annihilates itself the more precious does it become in the sight of
   God. To lose yourself in your own nothingness is a sure way of finding
   God. Let us endeavour then to make the simple recollection of God,
   combined with a profound forgetfulness of ourselves and a loving and
   humble submission to His will become our sole task. This effort will
   keep far from us all that is evil and retain in us all that is useful
   for our salvation, and meritorious in the sight of God.

   5th. Do not draw distinctions between the rest from labour, that is
   exterior, and that which is interior: it is all the same provided you
   submit willingly and keep interior peace--it is well to note this.

   6th. In our intercourse with others let us be detached in a way that
   will show how far removed we are from all tenderness or feeling. It is
   inconceivable how small a thing will suffice to impede the soul, and
   for how long a time, often for a whole life-time a trifle is capable of
   preventing the wonderful progress that grace would have effected in our
   souls. God requires an empty space even in the most remote recesses of
   our nature in order to communicate Himself to our souls.

   7th. It is in the most trying and annoying circumstances that you can
   practise the most perfect self-effacement and become confirmed in this
   matter by the loss of secondary things; let us then cheerfully
   acquiesce in the loss of everything except the loss of God.

   8th. Let no business matter, nor any occurrence whatever, have any
   value out of God, and let God be all in all to us.

   9th. Let us never be eager about anything nor allow our hearts to be
   oppressed by anything whatever. Where there is neither interest nor
   affection, there is no eagerness, nor sadness, but a void that is ever
   peaceful and unchangeable. In this we shall be established when we have
   detached ourselves from all created things, and shall find ourselves
   where self-seeking ceases; let us lose all to find all.

   10th. When we have reduced ourselves to the Unity that is God, all that
   is not God is undesirable to us. If we but knew how to content
   ourselves with this supreme Unity we should never trouble ourselves
   about anything else. This truth thoroughly understood and well
   practised will enable us to cut off all superfluous things, even those
   that seem good, holy, and necessary, but which, in the end might do us
   harm instead of helping us to attain the object of all our
   aspirations--namely to be one with the Supreme Unity.

   11th. Let our motto be that of blessed Giles of Assisi, "One to love, a
   single soul to a single God." Let us go further still and love our
   identity in this Unity, but let us forget all things else, and remember
   nothing but this Unity, this infinite Unity--God alone. This
   expression--unity--is very enlightening. It will make us cut off all
   multiplicity, all superfluity and will be very efficacious in inducing
   us to give our whole minds to God and to discover all that He desires
   from us. We shall find in it treasures of grace, of light, of
   innocence, of holiness and of happiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV.--Conduct after Faults.

   Concerning our conduct after having committed faults.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. Endure with humility before God the humiliation of your faults.
   After having been unfaithful to grace and after accidental failings
   remember always that you are nothing and have a holy contempt of
   yourself. This is the great advantage that God allows us to gain even
   from our faults.

   2nd. Fear, especially if carried to excess after whatever fault you may
   have committed proceeds from the devil. Instead of giving in to this
   dangerous illusion use every effort to repel it, and cast uneasiness
   away as you would cast a stone into the depths of the sea, and never
   dwell upon it voluntarily. However, should this feeling, by God's
   permission be stronger than the will, then have recourse to the second
   remedy, which consists in allowing ourselves to be crucified in peace
   according as God permits and as the martyrs abandoned themselves to
   their tortures.

   3rd. What is said about the fears that go with conspicuous faults
   applies equally to that feeling of uneasiness and distress which
   proceeds from constant little infidelities. This oppression of the
   heart is occasioned also by the devil. Despise and combat it as if it
   were a real temptation. Sometimes, however, God makes use of this
   anguish and excessive terror that certain souls suffer in order to
   purify them and make them die to themselves. If it is impossible to
   succeed in driving them away, the only remedy left is to endure this
   interior crucifixion peacefully in a spirit of absolute resignation to
   the divine will. This is the way to regain the peace and calm of a soul
   truly resigned to the will of God.

   4th. The fears roused about the recitation of the Office are nothing
   but a mere temptation because actual attention is not necessary. In
   order that prayer may have all its merit it is sufficient to make it
   with virtual attention which is nothing more than an intention to pray
   well formed before beginning, and this, no distraction even though
   voluntary can recall. So you can say the Office quite well while at the
   same time enduring continual involuntary distractions, as the trouble
   caused by these distractions is the best proof that the wish to pray
   well is heartfelt; it is also a sign that the wish is genuine.
   Therefore this wish makes the prayer a good and true prayer. Although
   hidden from the soul, on account of the trouble occasioned by these
   distractions the good intention, nevertheless, exists and is not hidden
   from the sight of God who gives us a double grace, first in hearing our
   prayers as He does all prayers rightly made, and then in concealing
   this from us in order that we may be mortified in everything, and on
   all occasions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  V.--Temptations and Trials.

   On temptations and interior trials. Addressed to Sister Anne
   Marie-Thérèse de Rosen, confidante of the inmost thoughts of Madame de
   Lesen, through whom the latter communicated with Fr. de Caussade.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st Principle. In the eyes of God violent temptations are great graces
   for those souls which by them suffer an interior martyrdom; they are
   the great battles in which great victories have made great saints.

   2nd Principle. The keen pain and cruel torment endured by a soul
   attacked by temptations is a sure sign that it has not consented, at
   any rate, not with that full entire consent, that advertence and
   deliberation which constitute a mortal sin.

   3rd Principle. During the darkness of these violent temptations the
   soul, fatigued and troubled as it must needs be, will commit many minor
   faults through weakness or negligence, surprise or thoughtlessness; but
   I maintain that in spite of these faults it merits more and is more
   pleasing to God and is truly better fitted for the reception of the
   Sacraments than ordinary persons, who, favoured with sensible devotion,
   have hardly any struggles to endure, nor any violence to do to
   themselves. The virtues of the former are much more solid having
   passed, and still passing through such severe trials.

   4th Principle. Whatever sins people who are tempted may have committed
   in the past, if for some years they have been firm and have given no
   voluntary consent, they will make the more progress in the ways of God
   the more humble they are rendered by these temptations, because
   humility is the foundation of all good.

   5th Principle. Most people, not much advanced in the ways of God and of
   the interior life, set no value on any operations but those that are
   sweet and evident to the senses. It is certain, however, that those
   operations that are most humiliating, afflicting, and crucifying, are
   most calculated to purify the soul and to unite it intimately with God.
   Also, all masters in the spiritual life are agreed in recognising that
   more progress is made in patient endurance than in action.

   6th Principle. As God converts, proves, and sanctifies seculars by
   temporal afflictions and adversities, so He usually converts, proves,
   purifies and sanctifies religious by spiritual trials and interior
   sufferings a thousand times more grievous; such as dryness, weariness,
   loathing, sinkings of the heart, spiritual despondency, humiliating
   temptations, violent and continual, excessive fears of being in mortal
   sin, terrors about His judgments and fear of reprobation. If, as
   spiritual books, preachers, directors of souls and good Christians
   aver, incessant afflictions are necessary for people in the world, and
   that without them many would be lost; why not say the same on interior
   crosses without which a multitude of Religious would never arrive at
   the perfection of their state? Experience shows daily that the most
   ordinary way by which God conducts the religious whom He most loves is
   that of greater interior trials; whereas, in regard to seculars who are
   dear to God, it is by the way of temporal adversity. Therefore we who
   preach patience, submission and a loving resignation in their troubles
   to seculars, ought in our own trials to apply the same rule to
   ourselves that we know so well how to give others. Do not interior
   crosses come also from God? Are they less mortifying, and, therefore,
   less salutary? Does God demand less submission from us, and is our
   patience less pleasing to Him?

   7th Principle. By the effect of His merciful wisdom, and to keep His
   elect in a state of dependence on His grace, in a more complete
   abandonment to His mercy, and in a state of greater humiliation, God
   hides from them nearly all the interior operation of His divine Spirit,
   the holy dispositions He accords them, the good desires He inspires,
   and the infused virtues with which He has enriched them. And for this
   purpose what are the means He employs? Let us pause to admire His
   wisdom and goodness. He makes use of the continuance and violence of
   temptations, of the trouble they cause in the soul, and the fear of
   having yielded to them. He hides the great virtues these souls acquire
   and the great victories they gain by allowing them to suffer slight
   defeats; and the ardent desire they have to make worthy communions by
   the fear of having made bad ones, their fervent love of God by their
   fear of being wanting in love for Him. Whereas they feel the greatest
   horror at the smallest faults He allows them to be saddened by the
   continual imperfections they imagine themselves to commit. He permits
   them to think all their good works badly done, and that they always
   give way to the first stirrings of all their passions, while, all the
   time they are gaining the victory.

   Nevertheless, as God, in keeping them in this state of humiliation and
   abandonment, does not wish to deprive them of all consolation and
   confidence during their trials, He makes known their state to
   enlightened directors, and if these souls are simple and obedient they
   may be assured of never being deceived. From the foregoing principles
   we can easily derive light in the doubts which occasionally assail us
   as regards communion and the fulfilment of other duties.

   First Rule. The fear of communicating should never deter us, especially
   if our confessor enjoins it. God does not usually allow him to be
   deceived. Even if that should happen the penitent cannot be deceived in
   submitting, nor commit sacrilege, because blind obedience given in good
   faith to a director can never lead us astray in the sight of God.
   Should these sufferings and temptations become redoubled after
   communion, instead of preventing the fruit of it, if endured peacefully
   and with humble resignation united to an abhorrence of evil, it does
   but increase it. This abhorrence is made sufficiently apparent by the
   pain and martyrdom these temptations cause, which those who really give
   way never experience. Books that treat of the effects of communion
   addressed to the generality of the faithful only speak of the ordinary
   effects, but there are many particular cases where quite contrary
   effects are experienced. Then communion produces a much more precious
   fruit, for, while the vehemence of the temptation increases with a
   lively sense of weakness, it serves to augment our merit and to develop
   in our hearts feelings of the most profound humility.

   Second Rule. Violent efforts to prepare for Communion are only pleasing
   to God in principle, but the result is disappointing because the soul
   becomes troubled and harassed. The intensity of these efforts must be
   moderated; everything that has to do with God, or the things of God
   should be done sweetly, tranquilly, and without effort. The best
   preparation for Holy Communion in this sad state is to endure patiently
   and with resignation this interior martyrdom. Preserve at any cost the
   peace in which God dwells and in which He is pleased to work. It is not
   grace but self-love that makes you keep away from Communion in order to
   escape the tortures and agonies that the soul endures by God's
   permission, to destroy in it this same miserable self-love. Go then
   without fear and even with a kind of joy to bear these interior
   operations that are so purifying and so sanctifying. The most wonderful
   good effects will be experienced eventually; effects that God hides
   from the soul at the time for its good. Therefore bear yourself as a
   criminal in His presence, and as a victim of His merciful Justice. This
   is the best attitude for a soul in this state, adopting any other it
   would never find peace. This apparent destitution and abandonment has
   but one aim, which is to increase self-distrust and to compel the soul
   to cast itself with greater confidence into the arms of God. It sees no
   other help and even that it cannot see. Faith and faith alone must
   suffice without any other support. The sensitive part of the soul can
   do nothing to affect the will, and God expects nothing from it but the
   free choice of the will which has complete mastery over its acts. The
   best disavowal of the temptation is the extreme horror of its attacks.
   No good can be attained by making a multitude of acts, these would only
   serve to trouble and fatigue the soul. It had best keep to the
   following act which comprises all that is required of it. "Lord, You
   are all-powerful and goodness itself, it is for You to defend me and to
   preserve me from all evil, that is beyond my power. I accept this
   suffering for love of You, only keep me from all sin." Afterwards let
   it remain in peace in the midst of the storm. It will find itself
   strengthened without knowing how by the hidden hand of God.

   Third Rule. The fact of being incapable of sustained thought, or of
   producing acts in prayer need not sadden the soul; for the best part of
   prayer and the essential part is the wish to make it well. The
   intention is everything in God's sight either for good or evil; now
   this desire it has to the extreme of anxiety--therefore it is only too
   keen, and has to be moderated. The soul must be kept peaceful during
   prayer and end prayer in peace. Instead of making so many resolutions
   let it be content to say: "My God make me perform such and such a good
   action, avoid such and such a bad one, because I am unable of myself to
   do anything. I feel my weakness too much, and my past experience
   teaches me that without You I can do nothing, and that if You do not
   act in me by the power of Your grace nothing will be effected." For
   directing the intention the soul abandoned to God need not make many
   acts, neither is it obliged to express them in words. The best thing
   for it is to be content to feel and to know that it is acting for God
   in the simplicity of its heart. This is making good interior acts; they
   are made simply by the impulsion of the heart without any outward
   expression, almost without thinking; just as worldly people without
   avowing it have but one end in everything--which is the satisfaction of
   their sensuality, their avarice, or their pride; God seeing their
   intention which is hidden in their own hearts will punish them for it.
   The chief principle of the spiritual life is to do everything, interior
   as well as exterior, peacefully, gently, sweetly, as St. Francis of
   Sales so often recommends. The moment we desire to form an act, it is
   already formed and held as accomplished, because God sees all our
   desires, even the first movement of the heart. Our desires, says
   Bossuet, are, with regard to God, what the voice is with regard to men,
   and a cry from the depths of the heart, even unuttered, is of the same
   value as a cry sent up to Heaven. For the rest, all the acts made in a
   state of the greatest aridity are usually better and more meritorious
   than those that are accompanied by sensible devotion. Forebodings about
   the future should not be indulged in except with due submission and
   resignation to the holy will of God, and this practice ought to have
   for aim, not so much the making of formal acts as the keeping of our
   hearts in a certain habitual state of readiness by which it seems to
   say to God every moment and in every circumstance, "Fiat, fiat! Yes, I
   desire and accept all, only preserve me from all sin. Yes, my heavenly
   Father, always, yes." This "Yes," uttered with all the heart contains
   the greatest acts, and expresses the greatest sacrifices.

  Prayer.

   Prayer of the Rev. Fr. de Caussade to obtain holy abandonment to the
   divine will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Oh my God when will it please You to give me the grace to remain
   habitually in this union of my will with Your adorable will, in which,
   without uttering a word all is said, in which all is accomplished by
   allowing You to act, in which one's only occupation is that of
   conforming more and more entirely to Your good pleasure; in which,
   nevertheless, one is saved all trouble since the care of all things is
   confided to You, and to repose in You is the only desire of one's
   heart? Delightful state, which, even in the absence of all sensible
   faith, affords the soul an interior joy altogether spiritual. I desire
   to repeat without ceasing by this habitual disposition of my heart,
   "Fiat," yes, my God, yes, all that You please, may Your holy will be
   done in all things. I renounce my own will which is very blind,
   perverse, and corrupt in consequence of its wretched self-love, the
   mortal enemy of Your grace, of Your pure love, of Your glory, and of my
   own sanctification.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer to be said in temptation:

   Oh my God! preserve me by Your grace from all sin, but as for the pain
   by which my self-love is put to death, and the humiliations which
   crucify my pride, I accept them with all my heart; not so much because
   they are the effects of your justice, but as benefits of your great
   mercy. Have pity on me then, dear Saviour, and help me.

  Letter I.--Happiness and Peace of Abandonment.

   To Sister Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux.

   The happiness and peace of a soul entirely abandoned to
   God.--Perpignan, 1732.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Madame and very dear Sister. You do well to give yourself up entirely
   and almost solely to the excellent practice of an absolute abandonment
   to the will of God. In this lies for you all perfection, this is the
   straight path leading most quickly and surely to a profound and
   unchangeable peace; it is also a secure safeguard to preserve this
   peace in the depths of the soul even in the midst of the most violent
   storms. Far from doing it harm, these storms will serve infallibly, not
   only to increase its merits, but also to strengthen more and more this
   union of the created will, with the divine will, and it is this which
   renders the peace of the soul unchangeable. Oh, what happiness! what
   grace! what a certainty as to the life to come, and what unalterable
   peace does she possess who belongs to God alone, who has no being out
   of God; who has no other support, no other help, no other hope but God
   alone.

   What a beautiful letter one of your Sisters has written to me on this
   subject! She says that for a whole month this one thought consoled,
   sustained and encouraged her so strongly that instead of reluctance to
   practise this virtue, she felt it a source of peace, and of an
   inexplicable joy. It seemed to her that God took the place of director,
   of friend, and will to be all things to her Himself. The more we become
   accustomed to these thoughts, the more settled will be our peace; and
   the fixed determination to seek God only, and to unite our will to His,
   is, in the best sense of the word, that "goodwill" to which peace has
   been promised.

   How can created things trouble a soul which neither desires nor fears
   them? Let us endeavour to arrive at this state and then our peace will
   be firmly established. Let us imitate the holy Archbishop of Cambray
   who said of himself, "I endure all until the worst comes to the worst,
   and then, finally, I find peace in complete self-renunciation."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter II.--A Short Way to Perfection.

   This abandonment is the shortest way to arrive at perfect love and
   perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Your letter, my dear Sister, put me in mind of the Gospel, where we see
   a young man approaching our Lord to ask Him the way to eternal life.
   Our good Master replied that he should keep the commandments, and when
   the young man answered that he had kept them faithfully from his youth,
   our Lord said, "If you would be perfect, go, sell all that you have and
   give to the poor, and come, follow Me." Your request is exactly the
   same as that of the young man. You want me to show you the shortest and
   surest way to attain perfection which is the fullness of life eternal.

   If I did not know you as I do I should answer that the first thing to
   do is to keep your rule, because the rule is to every Religious the
   only sure road to perfection. But I am aware that you have kept it with
   scrupulous fidelity for a long time: therefore, what you wish to learn
   at present is by what particular practice a Religious who faithfully
   fulfils all her duties can arrive at a high degree of sanctity. To this
   question, my dear Sister, my reply will be exactly similiar to that of
   our good Master. If you would be perfect, divest yourself of your own
   views, of all high notions of yourself, of studied elegance, of all
   reflexion of your own conduct; in fine, of all that you can call your
   own, and give yourself up without reserve and for ever to the guidance
   and good pleasure of God. Abandonment, yes, entire, blind, absolute
   abandonment; this, for souls circumstanced as you are is the height and
   the whole of perfection, because perfection consists in perfect love,
   and because for you the practice of abandonment is another word for the
   practice of pure love.

   It is true that love, even the purest, does not exclude in the soul the
   desire of its own salvation and perfection; but it is equally
   incontestable that the nearer the soul approaches the perfect purity of
   divine love the more its thoughts and reflexions are turned away from
   itself and fixed on the infinite goodness of God. This divine goodness
   does not compel us to repudiate the happiness it destines for us, but
   it has every right, doubtless, to be loved for itself alone without any
   reflexion on our own interests. This love which includes the love of
   ourselves but is independent of it, is what theologians call pure love,
   and all agree in recognising that the soul is so much the more perfect
   according to the measure in which it habitually acts under the
   influence of this love, and the extent to which it divests itself of
   all self-seeking, at any rate unless its own interests are subordinated
   to the interests of God. Therefore total renunciation without reserve
   or limit has no thought of self-interest--it thinks but of God, of His
   good pleasure, of His wishes, of His glory; it neither knows, nor
   desires to know aught else. Far from making its own interests a reason
   for its love, the soul, truly detached, generously accepts and embraces
   all that tends to annihilate them; darkness, uncertainty, weakness,
   humiliations! all these things give it pleasure directly it perceives
   that it so pleases the Beloved, because the pleasure and satisfaction
   of its Beloved form all its own pleasure and satisfaction. It neither
   has a will, nor a desire, nor a life of its own but is completely lost,
   engulfed, and, as it were, annihilated in the depth of the dark abyss
   of the will of Him whom it loves.

   I could tell you of souls known to me, which, having crossed this
   terrible pass of total abandonment, and thrown themselves into the deep
   abyss of the incomprehensible will of God, could not refrain from
   crying out in a transport of joy and holy confidence, "Oh! will of my
   God! how infinitely holy, just, and adorable it is, and still more
   lovable and beneficent. If it be entirely accomplished in me, I shall
   infallibly find true satisfaction in this life and eternal happiness in
   the next. Infinite mercy could not permit anything which did not tend
   to the greater good of His poor creatures. These only can be lost by
   the perversion of their own will, and by preventing the accomplishment
   of those designs which are always holy and most merciful. Give me then,
   oh my God, the grace to destroy by complete detachment this foolish
   resistance, and henceforth be assured that Your holy will shall be done
   in me; while I shall be equally assured of salvation and perfection."

  Letter III.--Peace in Turmoil.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.

   To be applied to herself. Profound peace can be enjoyed in this
   abandonment even amidst the bustle of business matters.--Perpignan,
   1740.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What I have always feared has come to pass. I have no power to refuse a
   charge that is contrary to all my predilections and for which I do not
   believe myself to have any aptitude. In vain have I groaned, prayed,
   implored, and offered to remain all my life in the vicariate of
   Toulouse: I have been compelled to make the sacrifice--one of the
   greatest of my whole life. But now I see plainly the hand of
   Providence. The sacrifice having been made and reiterated a hundred
   times God has taken from me all my former repugnance, so that I left
   the mother-house, which you know how much I loved, with a peace and
   liberty of spirit which astonished even myself. More still! When I
   arrived at Perpignan I found a large amount of business to attend to,
   none of which I understood; and many people to see, and to deal with;
   the Bishop, the steward, the king's lieutenant, the Parliament, the
   garrison staff. You know what horror I have always entertained for
   visits of any sort, and above all for those of grand people. Well! none
   of these have given me any alarm; in God I hope to find a remedy for
   everything, and I feel a confidence in divine Providence which enables
   me to surmount all difficulties. Besides this I enjoy peace and
   tranquillity in the midst of a thousand cares and anxieties, such as I
   should have imagined ought naturally to overwhelm me. It is true that
   what most contributes to produce this great peace is, that God has
   rendered my soul impervious to fear, and I desire nothing for this
   short and miserable life. Therefore, when I have done all in my power
   or that I felt before God that I ought to do, I leave the rest to Him,
   abandoning everything entirely and with my whole heart to divine
   Providence, blessing Him beforehand for all things and wishing in all,
   and above all, that His holy will may be done because I am convinced by
   faith and by numerous personal experiences that all comes from God, and
   that He is so powerful and such a good father, that He will cause
   everything to prosper for the advantage of His dear children. Has He
   not proved that He loves us more than life itself since He has
   sacrificed His life for love of us? Therefore, as He has done so much
   for love of us, are we not convinced that He will not forget us? I
   entreat you, then, not to worry about me and my affairs. Do the same
   that I have constrained myself to do. Directly I have taken measures
   before God and according to His will I leave all the rest to Him, and
   look to Him for success. I wait for this success with confidence, but
   also in peace; and whatever takes place I accept, not for the
   satisfaction of my impatient desires, but keeping pace with divine
   Providence, who rules and arranges all for our greater good, although
   generally we do not understand any of His ways. And how can we dare to
   judge Him, poor ignorant creatures as we are, and blind as the moles
   that burrow underground.

   Let us accept all from the hand of our good Father and He will keep us
   in peace in the midst of the greatest disasters of this world, which
   pass away like shadows. In proportion to our abandonment and confidence
   in God will our lives be holy and tranquil. Also where this abandonment
   is neglected there can be no virtue, nor any perfect rest.

   You were wrong in being surprised that I was not so at the views and
   plans of N., for, besides that nothing surprises me in this life, you
   ought to know my ways of always looking at the best side of things, and
   setting everything in a favourable light as St. Francis of Sales
   advises. This fortunate habit protects me from danger, and somehow
   makes it impossible for me to think badly, to judge harshly, or to
   speak uncharitably of anyone, whoever he may be.

   I strongly advise you to adopt it; it will greatly contribute to the
   preservation of the peace of your soul, and the purity of your
   conscience. Believe me, and sacrifice all human feelings, consoling
   yourself for all by abnegation and confidence in God alone, Who alone
   can fill the place of all else.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IV.--Liberty of Spirit.

   My dear Sister;

   I am touched at your wish to share in my trials, but I am happy in
   being able to reassure you. It is true that, at first, I felt a keen
   pain at finding myself loaded with a multitude of business affairs and
   other cares quite contrary to my attraction for silence and solitude;
   but notice how divine Providence has managed about it. God has given me
   the grace not to attach myself to any of these affairs, therefore my
   spirit is always at liberty. I recommend the success of them to His
   fatherly care, and this is why nothing distresses me. Things often go
   perfectly, and then I return thanks to God for it, but sometimes
   everything goes wrong and I bless Him for that equally and offer it to
   Him as a sacrifice. Once this sacrifice is made God puts everything
   right. Already this good Master has, more than once, given me these
   pleasant surprises. As regards having time to myself, I have more here
   than elsewhere. Visits are rare now, because I only go where duty
   obliges me, or necessity calls me. The Fathers themselves knowing my
   tastes, soon left me alone, and as they are aware that I do not act in
   this way out of pride or misanthropy, they do not take exception to my
   conduct, and indeed many are edified by it. Nevertheless I am not quite
   so dead as you seem to think, but God has given me grace not to care
   how discontented people are with me for following my own bent. It is He
   alone whom we ought to have any great interest in pleasing; as long as
   He is satisfied that is enough for us all, other things are a mere
   nothing. In a short time we shall appear before this great and
   sovereign Master, this infinite Being. Alas! of what avail will it be
   to us then for eternity to have done anything except for Him and
   inspired by His grace, and His holy Spirit? If one became more
   familiarised with those simple truths, what repose would not our hearts
   and souls enjoy during this present life? From how many idle fears,
   foolish desires and useless anxieties should we not be delivered; not
   only concerning this life, but also the next. I assure you that since
   my return to France I begin to look forward more than ever with great
   peace and tranquillity to the end of this sad life. How could I
   experience aught but joy at seeing the end of my exile approaching?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter V.--Recourse to Providence.

   To the same Sister.--Perpignan, 1741.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am constantly experiencing here the action of divine Providence, for
   no sooner do I make a sacrifice of everything to Him than He rectifies
   and makes it all turn out for the best. When I find myself at the last
   resource I place all my needs in the hands of that good Providence from
   whom I hope all things. I have recourse to Him always. I thank Him
   without ceasing for all, accepting all from His divine hand. Never does
   He fail those who put their whole trust in His protection. But how do
   people usually act? They substitute themselves, blind and powerless as
   they are, for that divine Providence infinitely wise and infinitely
   good. They build on their own efforts and thus withdrawing themselves
   from the ruling of divine love they deprive themselves of the helps
   they would have received had they kept within its shelter. What folly!
   How can we doubt that God understands our requirements better than we
   do ourselves, and that His arrangements in our regard are most
   advantageous to us although we do not comprehend them? We might make
   use of the small amount of sense we possess to decide that we will
   allow ourselves to be guided by that sweet Providence even though we
   cannot fathom the secret activities it employs, nor the particular ends
   it desires to attain. Should you remark that if it is sufficient for us
   passively to submit to be led then what about the proverb, "God helps
   those who help themselves"? I did not say that you were to do
   nothing--without doubt it is necessary to help ourselves; to wait with
   folded arms for everything to drop from Heaven is according to natural
   inclination, but would be an absurd and culpable quietism applied to
   supernatural graces. Therefore while co-operating with God, and leaning
   on Him, you must never leave off working yourself. To act in this way
   is to act with certainty and consequently with calmness. When, in all
   our actions we look upon ourselves as instruments in the hands of God
   to work out His hallowed designs, we shall act quietly, without
   anxiety, without hurry, without uneasiness about the future, without
   troubling about the past, giving ourselves up to the fatherly
   providence of God and relying more on Him than on all possible human
   means. In this way we shall always be at peace, and God will infallibly
   turn everything to our good, whether temporal or eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VI.--Alone with God.

   To the same Sister. Abandonment ameliorates the wearisomeness of
   solitude.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   You are giving yourself unnecessary trouble about me. You have
   persuaded yourself that I look upon the isolation in which I live as a
   misfortune, whereas this is far from being the case. Every day I bless
   God for this happy stroke of His providence. I learn by it to die to
   all things in order to live to God alone. I was not so shut away at
   ----. There, many events both within and without kept me up, and made
   me feel alive; now, there is nothing of that kind. I am in a veritable
   desert alone with God. Oh! how delightful it is! Great interior
   desolation is joined to this exterior solitude. However painful to
   nature such a state may be, I bless God for it because I have no doubt
   that it is good for me. It is a universal death to all feeling even
   about spiritual matters, a sort of annihilation through which I must
   pass in order to rise again with Jesus Christ to a new life, a life all
   in God, a life stripped of everything, even of consolation, because in
   that the senses take part. God wishes to leave me destitute of all
   outward things, and dead to all to live only to Him. May His holy will
   be done in all things, and for ever! This is the strong pillar to which
   we must remain firmly fastened, this is the solid immovable foundation
   of all our perfection. You see, my good Sister, how little I require
   your compassion, since the subject on which you pity me most is
   precisely the subject of my joy. I must own, however, that the extreme
   solitude in which I found myself here so suddenly did not at first
   appear at all pleasant to me except in the superior part of my soul,
   but very soon my whole soul participated in it. Once more have I learnt
   by experience that we cannot do better than to follow step by step the
   course appointed by divine Providence. That is my great attraction, and
   more than ever am I resolved to devote myself to it blindly, without
   reservations and in all things, such as places, employments, seasons,
   in fine for everything. For a long time I have contented myself with
   asking God for one single grace, which is that I may have no other
   desire than to please Him, and no other fear than to offend Him. If He
   gives me this grace I shall be rich indeed both for time and eternity.
   I wish for you as for myself, only this. What can one fear who abandons
   oneself entirely to God? Besides the peace of mind it brings we shall
   find our perfection therein. If greater merit is gained in sacrifice
   what can be more meritorious than the entire sacrifice of our own will
   even in those things that seem to be most reasonable and holy, to the
   fulfilment of the will of God alone? Let us then have no other
   employment, no other ambition but that of uniting our will to the most
   merciful will of God, and let us be well assured that this will be our
   salvation even when we imagine that all is lost.

  Letter VII.--A Holy Community.

   The happiness experienced by a Community of Poor Clares in practising
   abandonment to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I have made a discovery here that has given me more satisfaction than
   anything else could have done. In this town of Albi there is a convent
   of Poor Clares of the Great Reform, entirely separated from the world,
   who take no dowry and live on daily alms. The Superior is the most
   saintly person I have ever encountered in my life. I felt beforehand a
   great interior drawing to have a share in their holy intercourse, and
   nearly all of them have told me that they felt the same about me. I
   believe that God intends to bestow some great graces on me through
   their holy prayers. They lead a very interior life and practice
   abandonment to God with a remarkable perfection. When I assured them
   that on every occasion that presented itself I would try to procure
   alms for them, they seemed to be quite scandalised and begged me to
   think only of their spiritual needs and to make them more detached and
   more holy by my instructions and prayers. You cannot imagine anything
   more wonderful than their union, candour, and simplicity. Impressed by
   their great austerities I asked them one day if such a hard life did
   not affect their health and shorten their lives. They replied that
   there were hardly ever any invalids amongst them, and that very few
   died young, most of them living to be over eighty. They added that
   fasting and mortification contributed to improve their health and to
   prolong life, which good cheer usually tended to shorten. I have never
   beheld such gaiety and holy joy anywhere else as among these good nuns.
   To please them I had to talk continually on spiritual subjects as they
   could not tolerate gossip and worldly news, but said "of what use is
   all that to us"? I assure you, you would be edified and very glad on my
   account of this fortunate discovery, for, although I have often visited
   this place before, I knew the Community only by name, and looked on the
   nuns as dead to all; buried and quite out of sight.

   What a favour and consolation for me! I might add it is fitting also to
   praise and magnify God for the wonders He has worked in these souls.

  Letter VIII.--Our Dependence on God.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen (1724).

   Concerning motives for abandonment on account of the goodness and
   greatness of the divine Majesty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Do not ask me for new ways of acquiring the friendship of God, and of
   making rapid progress in virtue. I know only one way which I have more
   than once explained to you, and of which my daily experience
   demonstrates more and more clearly the infallible efficacy. This secret
   is, abandonment to divine Providence. Bear with me for calling your
   attention to it once again, and do not grow weary, either, of learning
   what I do not weary of teaching you. I should like to cry out
   everywhere, "Abandonment! abandonment!" and again "Abandonment!"
   unbounded and unreserved; and for two good reasons.

   1st. Because the greatness of God and His sovereign dominion over all,
   require that all creatures should bow before Him, that all should be
   cast down, and as it were annihilated before His supreme Majesty. There
   is no comparison between His infinite greatness and our nothingness. It
   is above all things, comprehends all things, absorbs all things in its
   immensity. Or, rather, it is all things since all things that have a
   separate existence from the Divinity have received their being from Him
   in creation and still continue to receive it in their preservation
   which is creation renewed unceasingly. Thus the existence we have
   received from God remains, as it were, in the bosom of the Divinity and
   never leaves its service, but remains plunged and engulfed therein.
   God, then, is the author of all being, nothing is, nor lives, nor
   subsists, nor moves, but by Him, and in Him, He is Who is, by Whom and
   in Whom all exists, and Who is in all things.

   Things, compared with nothingness, seem to have an existence, but,
   compared with God, they seem nothing; they only possess being and
   substance by the gift of God; while He alone exists of Himself, and
   owes nothing to any other than Himself. Therefore as everything belongs
   to Him, necessarily everything will return to Him that His supreme
   dominion may be glorified by all His creatures. Those creatures that
   have not the gift of reason glorify Him according to their state in
   following with complete exactness and perfect obedience the laws of
   their nature; but He has a right to expect from His reasonable
   creatures a glory far more worthy of Him; which results from their
   voluntary abandonment. And what more just and noble use could any
   reasonable creature make of its liberty than in rendering to God all it
   has received from Him, and in offering Him in advance all that may be
   added to it in the future? Understand me thoroughly; the homage that
   God expects from us He alone can give us power to render Him in giving
   us the thought, the desire, and the will. Also if He gives us this
   grace, and if we profit by it, far from taking the credit to ourselves
   we ought to thank Him for it as the crown of all His other benefits.
   The impulsion which prompts us to offer up this last thanksgiving is
   yet another grace, as well as the thought that projected the act. Thus,
   each of our moments, each of our actions, in increasing our debt, forms
   new ties and makes us depend more entirely on the divine goodness. At
   this thought, our spirit, our heart, our soul remain as though
   engulfed, lost, annihilated in the profound abyss of this sovereign
   dominion.

   Our merits, regarded in this light, far from inspiring us with pride
   will pierce us with the idea of our own utter dependence, which, as we
   see more clearly we shall understand better; and we shall finish by
   arriving at the complete annihilation of our entire being before God.
   Thus alone shall we be true, and shall be before God in our proper
   state--that of nothingness. Thus, also, shall we practise perfect
   abandonment. To keep oneself always in this interior disposition is
   what Holy Scripture calls "walking in justice--in truth," outside this
   state there is nothing but falsehood and injustice towards God.
   Injustice because we deprive Him of the gory that belongs to Him;
   falsehood because we flatter ourselves in appropriating what can never
   belong to us.

   2nd. The second motive to induce us to abandon ourselves without
   reserve is, that, unless God receives from His creatures the homage due
   to His infinite Majesty He cannot give free vent to His infinite
   goodness. All that His creatures bring to Him by a total renunciation
   He wills to return to them by a gratuitous gift of His mercy; or
   rather, He repays infinitely more than they have given Him, because in
   return for the gift of their limited being He bestows on them His
   infinite riches. Therefore at the bottom of this abyss of renunciation
   where we should expect to find nothingness we find infinitude. What an
   exchange of the divine liberality! What ingenuity of divine wisdom!
   What a contrivance and surprise of the divine goodness!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IX.--The Goodness of God.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.

   Another fresh motive for abandoning ourselves to God. His fatherly
   providence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I do not understand your uneasiness, my dear Sister, nor why you take
   pleasure in tormenting yourself as you do about the future, when your
   faith teaches you that the future is in the hands of an infinitely good
   Father Who loves you more than you love yourself, and who understands
   what is necessary for you much better than you. Have you forgotten that
   everything that happens is ordained by divine Providence? And if we
   recognise this truth how is it that we are not humbly submissive in
   every event both great and small to all that God wills or permits? Oh!
   how blind we are when we desire anything other than what God wills! He
   alone knows the dangers that threaten us in the future, and the helps
   we shall require. I am strongly persuaded that we should all be lost if
   God were to grant us all that we asked for, and this is why, says St.
   Augustine, God out of compassion for our blindness, does not always
   hear our prayers, and often gives us the exact contrary to what we
   asked Him, as being in truth better for us. Truly it seems to me that
   in this world nearly all of us are like people who in madness, or
   delirium, ask for exactly what will cause their death, and to whom it
   is refused out of charity, or in pity. Oh my God! if this truth were
   but understood, with what blind abandonment would we not submit to all
   the decrees of Your divine Providence! What peace and tranquillity of
   heart should we enjoy about all things and in all things, not only as
   to outward events but also about the interior state of our souls. Even
   if the painful vicissitudes through which God makes us pass should be
   in punishment for our unfaithfulness, we ought to say to ourselves,
   "God wills it by permitting it," and humbly submit. We must then detest
   the offence and accept the painful and humiliating consequences, as St.
   Francis of Sales so often recommends. Would that this principle,
   thoroughly grasped, could put an end to the troubles and anxieties that
   are so useless and so destructive of our peace of mind and spiritual
   progress. Shall I never be able even with the help of grace to
   introduce into your soul this great principle of faith, so sweet, so
   consoling, so tranquillising? "Oh my God!" we ought to repeat, "may
   Your will be accomplished in me and never my own. May Yours be
   accomplished because it is infinitely just and also infinitely
   advantageous to me. I acknowledge that You can will nothing that is not
   for the greatest benefit to Your creatures as long as they are
   submissive to Your commands. May my wishes never be granted if they do
   not agree perfectly with Yours, because in that case they would be
   disastrous to me. And if ever, my God, it happens that either through
   ignorance or passion I should persist in desiring things contrary to
   Your will, may I always be refused or punished, as the effect, not of
   Your justice, but of Your compassion and great mercy."

   "Whatever happens," said St. Francis of Sales, "I shall always side
   with divine Providence, even if human wisdom tears her hair out with
   spite." If you were more enlightened you would judge very differently
   from the ordinary run of human beings; then, too, what a source of
   peace and strength this way of looking at things would prove to you.
   How happy are saints! and how peacefully they live! and how blind and
   stupid we are in not accustoming ourselves to think and act as they do,
   but to prefer living shut up in thick darkness which makes us wretched
   as well as blind and guilty. Let us then make it our study, aim, and
   purpose to conform ourselves in all things to the holy will of God, in
   spite of interior rebellion. Even about this rebellion we must
   acquiesce in the will of God, for it compels us to remain always before
   Him in a state of sacrifice as to all things; in an interior silence of
   respect, adoration, self-effacement, submission, love, and an entire
   abandonment full of confidence to His divine will.

  Letter X.--Continued Troubles.

   To the same Sister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I am sorry that your troubles continue, but I should be much more sorry
   if you refused to profit by them, at least in the way of making a
   virtue of necessity. Remember our great principles:

   1st. That there is nothing so small, or so apparently indifferent which
   God does not ordain or permit, even to the fall of a leaf.

   2nd. That God is sufficiently wise, and good and powerful and merciful
   to turn even the most, apparently, disastrous events to the advantage
   and profit of those who humbly adore and accept His will in all that He
   permits. Is there anything more consoling in religion than these two
   principles? When we know too that our natural dislikes and rebellions,
   far from preventing the merit of submission, do but increase it as long
   as this submission is sincere in the higher part of the soul; when we
   know further that these fits of impatience and vexation which are only
   half voluntary, are the effect of frailty, and do not destroy our
   submission, but only slightly diminish its merit.

   These imperfections are often useful to us by rendering us more humble,
   and preventing us from losing all our merit through a vain
   self-complacency. Do you recollect this wise saying of Fénélon? "It is
   a great grace of God to be willing to suffer, not in a grand and heroic
   way, but quite humbly, and in small things because in this way we gain
   patience and become little and humble at the same time."

   As for the grievous trials of which you speak, add them to your cross
   as an extra weight that divine Providence allows you to carry, and
   instead of one "Fiat," say two, then remain in peace in the superior
   part of your soul whatever storms and tempests rage in the inferior
   part. The latter resembles the base of a high mountain where bad
   weather is usually encountered, however fine and clear the sky is at
   the summit. Try then to keep yourself always on the summit in those
   serene heights above the thunderstorms and every disaster.

   It seems to me that your thoughts dwell too much on creatures. As for
   me, thank God I see only Him in all things. Everything helps me to Him.
   Since it is He that has placed us where we are, dependent on those who
   afflict us, it is, therefore, on Him alone that we must depend. It is
   He alone, I am certain, who inspires or allows the actions of men. I
   will accept nothing that does not come to me from Him, will owe no
   obligation to any one but Him, will thank no one but Him alone. If you
   call to mind how little men contribute to the existing state of things
   you will see that it is divine Providence who manages everything in a
   manner singularly adapted for the welfare of those who submit to Him,
   and who disposes everything for their best advantage. God can produce
   occurrences, and arrange necessary circumstances as seems good to Him,
   may He be blessed for all, in all, and for ever.

   I am aware that my direction is considered rather too simple, but what
   does that matter? This holy simplicity hated by the world is, to me, so
   delightful that I never dream of correcting it. Everyone to his taste.
   I respect those who are wise and prudent, but content myself with
   remaining one of those poor, simple and little people of whom Jesus
   Christ speaks, and after His example St. Francis of Sales. Let us be
   sure that God arranges all for the best. Our fears, our activities, our
   urgencies make us imagine inconveniences where in reality they do not
   exist. Let us follow step by step the ways of divine Providence, and
   when we realize what is required of us let us desire that and nothing
   else. God knows much better than we do ourselves what is most suitable
   for us, His poor creatures. Our misfortunes and sufferings often result
   from the accomplishment of our own desires. Let us leave all to God and
   then all will go well. Abandon to Him everything in general: that is
   the best way, indeed the only way of providing infallibly and surely
   for all our real interests. I say "real" because there are false
   interests that lead to our ruin. The abandonment to divine Providence
   which I practise and counsel others to adopt is not so heroic nor so
   difficult as you seem to imagine. It is the centre of a solid peace,
   and in it I find an unchangeable repose, proof against the most trying
   events. Oh! how well repaid we are for the small and miserable
   sacrifices we make for God! And then, once made, there are no more to
   make, because we no longer have any other desires. We cannot entertain
   even a wish for ourselves apart from the will of our sovereign Master,
   nor without His permission. What a happy state both for this life and
   the next!

  Letter XI.--Good Wishes.

   To the Sisters of the Visitation at Nancy (1732).

   Mutual good wishes between souls who seek nothing but God alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear Sisters,

   Your good wishes for me are quite heavenly; they are evidently dictated
   by the heart, but what a heart! One that is entirely spiritual and
   interior, which sets no value on anything but what is divine, and has
   no interests but those for eternity.

   Profiting by such an example I return you a thousand good wishes of the
   same sort, and in the same spirit as yours, and particularly that God
   will be pleased to preserve and increase more and more; 1st. The love
   of solitude and silence which forms the spirit of recollection so
   necessary for the interior life; 2nd. The spirit of peace and charity,
   of union, and of detachment and interior abnegation which preserves
   that sweet and tranquil peace in the soul, which is the true happiness
   of this present life and the foundation of the interior life; 3rd. An
   attraction for the practice of the presence of God, and for heartfelt
   prayer, for these are the mainsprings of the spiritual life; 4th. The
   sincere will to be all for God which incessantly renews the spirit of
   fervour; 5th. An entire and perfect union of our wills with the will of
   God, which will make us contented with our spiritual poverty because
   God wills it. Thus we sacrifice our self-love however deep-rooted and
   hidden it may be.

   These rules are indispensably necessary for certain souls who, although
   indifferent to all other things, yet afflict themselves about their
   interior miseries. In the practice of them they will find peace. In
   this way all that is wanting to us will be supplied, all our miseries
   will be remedied, and our poverty enriched. For there can be no greater
   treasure in our souls than conformity to the will of God, submitting
   our own wills to His, even if it should be at the expense of those
   interests which are most dear to us and which we regard as most
   desirable. Since we ought to desire virtues only to please God, will it
   not be to wish to have them all in wishing to conform to the divine
   good pleasure, and with so generous and so perfect a conformity
   extending to all things with the sole exception of an offence against
   God?

   I congratulate you with all my heart on the joy you feel in celebrating
   the anniversary of the foundation of your house, but most of all on the
   fact that your house was founded in the poverty of the Crib and in
   confidence in divine Providence. The virtues of your saintly first
   Sisters were built on this rich foundation and have helped to construct
   the edifice. Your virtues will, I hope, maintain it and bring it to
   perfection for the honour and glory of its divine Master who is its
   sole proprietor.

SECOND BOOK

    ON THE EXERCISE OF THE VIRTUE OF ABANDONMENT
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter I.--Some General Principles.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet (1731).

   On the principles and practice of abandonment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Our Lord has given me something better for you than that which you
   desire, something that it did not occur to you to ask for. It is a
   summary of some general principles to guide your conduct in life, with
   an explanation of the easiest way of putting them into practice.

   1st Principle. The mainspring of the spiritual life is a good will,
   that is to say, a sincere desire to belong to God entirely and without
   reserve; consequently it is not possible to renew too frequently this
   holy desire in order to strengthen it, and to make it more lasting and
   efficacious.

   2nd Principle. The firm resolution to belong to God should produce in
   you a determination to think only of Him, and this can be practised in
   two ways, first by accustoming yourself never voluntarily to entertain
   thoughts, or to reflect on subjects which do not concern God directly
   or indirectly as to the duties of your state in general, or in
   particular. The best way of dealing with idle thoughts is not to combat
   and still less to be anxious and troubled about them, but just to let
   them drop, like a stone into the sea. Gradually the habit of acting
   thus will become easy. The second way to think only of God is to forget
   everything else, and one arrives at this state by dint of dropping all
   idle thoughts, so that it often happens that for some time one may pass
   whole days without, apparently, thinking of anything as though one had
   become quite stupid. It often happens that God even places certain
   souls in this state, which is called the emptiness of the spirit and of
   the understanding, or the state of nothingness. This annihilation of
   one's own spirit wonderfully prepares the soul for the reception of
   that of Jesus Christ. This is the mystical death to the workings of
   one's own activity, and renders the soul capable of undergoing the
   divine operation. This great emptiness of the spirit frequently
   produces another void even more painful--that of the will; so that one
   has seemingly, no feeling, either for the things of this world, or even
   for God, being equally callous to all. It is often God Himself who
   effects this second void in the souls of certain people. One must not,
   then, try to get rid of this state, since it is a preparation for the
   reception of God's most precious operations, and is the second mystical
   death intended to precede a happy resurrection to a new life. This
   two-fold void must therefore be valued and retained. It is a double
   annihilation very difficult for pride and self-love to endure, and must
   be borne with the holy joy of an interior spirit.

   3rd Principle. We must confine our whole attention to fulfilling as
   perfectly as possible the holy will of God to its full extent,
   abandoning everything else to Him, such as, the care of all our
   temporal and also our spiritual interests, as, our advancement in
   virtue. The practice of this double abandonment is, first--every time
   we feel in our hearts a desire, or a fear, or have ideas and form
   projects regarding our own interests or those of our parents and
   friends, to say to God, "Lord, I sacrifice all this; I give up all my
   miserable interests to You. May all that You please, all that You wish,
   happen. However, as there may be occasions when it is reasonably
   necessary to think and to act, I beg You to give me the thought at the
   right time, and thus I shall do nothing but follow what You deign to
   inspire, and I accept in advance either good or adverse results."
   Having made this interior act we should let all our fears and desires
   drop like a stone, without troubling ourselves any more about them,
   being assured that God will give us, in His own good time, the thought
   and impulse to act according to His holy will and divine intention.

   As for the practice of the second kind of abandonment which is that of
   progress in perfection, it is a most difficult subject very badly set
   forth by spiritual writers, and one about which most mistakes are made,
   mistakes that produce nothing but trouble, and retard our progress in
   the ways of God. Here is a very simple method given by Jesus Christ to
   St. Teresa when He appeared to her: "Daughter," he said to her, "never
   think of anything but how to please Me, to love Me, and to do My will,
   and I, on My side, will attend to all your affairs, both temporal and
   spiritual." To thoroughly grasp this lofty precept look upon yourself
   as one who has entered the service of a king, like Solomon for example,
   the greatest, wisest and best of kings. However little nobility of
   feeling, refinement of heart, good sense or ability such a person might
   possess, he would doubtless address his master in these terms, "Lord,
   since I know that You are a Prince, as good as You are powerful, as
   liberal as You are magnificent, I give myself to You without reserve; I
   will serve You without knowing how much You will pay me by the day or
   the year, nor even at the end of my time. I promise to think only of
   Your interests, and mine I leave to Your discretion, or rather, to Your
   goodness and generosity." Often apply this very imperfect and mean
   comparison to the great Master we serve and be assured that if the
   great King would not endure to see himself surpassed in liberality by
   one of his servants neither will the all-powerful and infinitely good
   God allow Himself to be outdone by His miserable creatures. The
   practice of this principle and the consequences to be deduced from it
   are:

   1st. An intense desire takes possession of me to acquire the gifts of
   prayer, humility, sweetness, and the love of God. To this I answer, "Do
   not let me think so much of my own interests; my business is to occupy
   myself simply and quietly with God, to accomplish His will in all that
   He requires at present. That is my task, all the rest I leave to God;
   my progress is His business as mine is to busy myself for Him and to
   obey His orders."

   2nd. It occurs to me that I am still very imperfect, full of faults and
   defects, infidelities and weakness; when shall I be freed from these
   miseries? "By God's grace I have no affection for my faults, I am
   determined to combat them, but I shall only be freed from them when God
   pleases; that is His business; mine is to hate these faults, and to
   make a point of combating them with patience, sorrow and humility till
   it shall please God to render me victorious."

   3rd. I begin to think that I am so blind that I cannot see my faults,
   even when I have to weep for them before God and to confess them. I
   reply without hesitation, "But I wish to know my sins, I no longer live
   in a state of voluntary dissipation, I quietly employ a little time in
   self-examination." This is all that God requires, "He will give me more
   light and knowledge when He considers it necessary; that is His
   business. I have placed the affair of my spiritual progress entirely in
   His hands, it is therefore sufficient for the present to accuse myself
   of the daily faults that God reveals to me, and some sin of my past
   life."

   4th. It strikes me: Have I ever made a good confession? Has God
   forgiven me? Am I in a state of grace, or not? What progress have I
   made in prayer and in the ways of God? I at once answer: "God has
   willed to hide all this from me to make me abandon myself blindly to
   His mercy; I submit, and adore His judgments. I wish to know only that
   which He desires me to know, and to walk in darkness if such is His
   will; it is His business to know my state, mine to occupy myself about
   Him alone, to serve Him and to love Him as much and as well as I can;
   He will take care of all the rest, I depend upon Him."

   5th. But for a long time past I have asked Him for certain graces; to
   obtain them I have begged the intercession of those powerful advocates
   the ever-blessed Virgin, Saint Joseph, the Holy Apostles and all the
   Saints in heaven, and it seems as if nothing will move Him: "He is the
   Master, may His will be accomplished in all things; I desire neither
   graces, nor merits, nor perfections beyond those it pleases Him to give
   me, His will is enough for me and shall always be the rule of my
   desires."

  Letter II.--The Three Degrees of Virtue.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil (1731).

   A general plan of the spiritual combat.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "God has left man in the hands of his own counsel; life or death, good
   or evil are before him, what he chooses will be given to him." By these
   words holy Scripture makes us understand that man is a free agent, and
   that his salvation depends on the good use he makes of his liberty. It
   is true that since the fall of man his will has become weakened towards
   good, and turned towards evil, but with the help of grace which never
   fails him, it is always in his power to strengthen his will towards
   good, although naturally so weak; and to fortify it against evil
   towards which it is, unhappily, so much inclined.

   There are three degrees of virtue which the liberty of our enfeebled
   will can practise only with great pain, and much difficulty. 1st. That
   virtue essential for salvation, the neglect of which constitutes a
   mortal sin. 2nd. That virtue enjoined by a less stringent precept the
   omission of which is a venial sin. 3rd. That perfect virtue that we
   cannot neglect without a diminution of merit.

   All these inclinations which weaken in us the resolution to fulfil our
   essential obligations, such as, hate, revenge, anger, inordinate
   attachments, avarice, envy, etc., are so many sources of spiritual
   ruin. The same can be said, proportionately, of those inclinations
   which incite us to commit venial sin, or voluntary imperfections,
   because whoever neglects small faults will fall little by little into
   grave ones, says the Holy Spirit; and to be lax in the pursuit of
   perfection in but one point will prevent the acquisition of it for
   ever. Therefore, every victory by which our will is strengthened in the
   practice of virtue is a sign of predestination and of salvation. Our
   principal aim, then, ought to be to fortify continually our will
   towards virtue, and to overcome our inclination towards evil. We have
   three means to assure and hasten the success of this undertaking. The
   first is to make great sacrifices to God by overcoming all repugnance
   in that which costs us the most. The second is to make all those daily
   little sacrifices for which occasions are frequent and continual, and
   this with a constant generous and universal fidelity.

   The third means and the greatest is prayer, but prayer that is humble,
   simple, and inspired by the Holy Spirit; because it is He, as St. Paul
   says, who teaches us to pray and who Prays in us "with unspeakable
   groanings." The Publican is an excellent model of prayer: he prayed
   silently, with deep and humble compunction. The greatest sinners and
   the most imperfect can pray like him and thus from the depths of their
   misery will rise by degrees, if they remain faithful, to the highest
   sanctity.

  Letter III.--The First Work of God in the Soul.

   To Madame de Lesen (1731).

   On the first work of God in the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am not at all surprised at the effect of the first meditation on the
   great truths, and I thank our Lord for it, and congratulate you. You
   required these keen feelings, and I believe they are likely to last
   until they produce in you the spirit of compunction and of humility
   which should form the foundation of your spiritual structure, and the
   beginning of your spiritual infancy. The agitation which accompanied
   these feelings was too great, but if I am not mistaken, it was
   involuntary and perhaps necessary as an effect of divine justice. The
   same feelings when they recur will be quieter and more tranquil. I was
   aware before receiving your letter that God had given you great graces,
   and I guessed that you had not properly corresponded with them, and
   this I realise now better than before.

   1st. Your soul is like a huge hall, quite bare, or at least very badly
   furnished.

   2nd. It will never be a fit dwelling for our sovereign Lord if He
   Himself does not give and arrange the valuable furniture suitable for
   such a guest.

   3rd. He will never make His arrangements nor bestow His gifts on your
   soul except in the silence of prayer. You have, therefore, only to keep
   the hall swept and clean with the help of grace, then let Him who takes
   care of the beautiful furniture with which it ought to be decorated,
   arrange it according to His own taste.

   Do not meddle then without necessity in a work which your interference
   would spoil. Let it alone, and imagine yourself a canvas on which a
   great master is about to paint a picture, and arm yourself with courage
   because I foresee that it will take a considerable time to pound and
   mix the colours, and then to lay them on, arrange them and vary the
   tints. You must keep the canvas prepared and get it stretched and
   nailed to the frame; this is humiliation next to annihilation of self
   and an act of resignation and total abandonment inasmuch as you lose
   your own will in the will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IV.--Practice of Abandonment.

   To Sister Marie-Henriette de Bousmard, on the general practice of
   abandonment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are quite right, my dear daughter, to say what you do and it was
   the favourite maxim of St. J.F. de Chantal, "Not so much talk, so much
   science, nor so many writings, but more good practice." In fact with
   regard to those souls who have acquired the habit of avoiding all
   deliberate faults, and of fulfilling faithfully all the duties of their
   state, all perfection is contained in the exercise of a continual
   resignation to the will of God in all things, of a complete abandonment
   to all the arrangements of divine Providence whether exterior or
   interior, at present or in the future. A single "fiat," or, as St.
   Francis of Sales said, "Yes, my heavenly Father, yes, always yes," said
   and reiterated by the habitual disposition of the heart without even
   the necessity of pronouncing it interiorly, is the short and straight
   path to the highest perfection, because it is a continual union with
   the holy and adorable will of God.

   To arrive so far it is not necessary to make a great deal of fuss, only
   two things are necessary: 1st, To be profoundly persuaded that nothing
   takes place in this world either spiritually or physically, that God
   does not will, or at least, permit; therefore we ought no less to
   submit to the permissions of God in things that do not depend upon us,
   than to His absolute will.

   2nd, Believe firmly that everything that God wills or permits will,
   according to the purpose of an all-powerful and paternal Providence,
   turn always to the advantage of those who practise this submission.
   Resting on this two-fold assurance let us remain firm and immovable in
   our adhesion to all that God pleases to ordain in our regard. Let us
   acquiesce in advance in a spirit of humility, love and sacrifice, to
   all the imaginable decrees of His providence, let us assure Him that we
   shall be satisfied with all that contents Him. It is not always
   possible for us, doubtless, to feel this satisfaction in the inferior
   part of our soul, but we will, at least, keep it in the higher part of
   the spirit, in that highest point of the will, as St. Francis of Sales
   puts it; it will then be all the more meritorious.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter V.--Means of Acquiring this Practice.

   On the means of acquiring abandonment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You speak truly, my dear Sister, and it is indeed the Spirit of God who
   inspired your remark; one of the greatest obstacles to the reign of the
   divine Spirit in our hearts is our own miserable nature which recoils
   from the sort of captivity and death with which the holy abandonment
   enables us to purchase a share in the liberty and life of God.

   But this same Spirit who has made you so well understand the evil, will
   assist you to apply a remedy for it. In a few words this is what you
   ought to do to arrive at pure love, and total abandonment. 1st, You
   must desire it ardently, and energetically will to acquire it, no
   matter at what cost. 2nd, Believe firmly and often say to God that it
   is absolutely impossible for you, left to yourself, to acquire such
   perfect dispositions, but that grace will make everything easy, that
   you hope for this grace through His mercy, and ask for it by and
   through Jesus Christ.

   3rd, Humble yourself quietly and peacefully for as long as you are kept
   back from this holy captivity; do not be discouraged, but, on the
   contrary, protest to God that you are awaiting with confidence the
   moment when it shall please Him to grant you this decisive grace which
   will make you die to yourself to live a new life in Him, a life hidden
   with Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   4th, If you are submissive to the inspirations of the Spirit of God you
   will beware of making your progress depend on the vividness and
   sensible sweetness of interior impressions. This divine Spirit on the
   contrary will make you set more value on operations that are almost
   imperceptible, because the more subtle and profound they are and the
   more withdrawn from the senses, the more divine they become. Then it is
   that you become more entirely for God, because you will tend to Him
   with your whole being and with all your powers, uniting yourself to Him
   without particularising anything, as every being seeks its centre. Be
   persuaded besides that you still have a great way to go. You will have
   to work and to grow for a long time, but concerning this as about all
   other things you ought to say "Oh my God, Your holy and most amiable
   will shall always be the exact measure of my desires however holy,
   just, or apparently perfect they may be. I desire neither grace nor
   sanctity but at the time appointed and in the precise degree You will,
   nothing more, nothing less. If all the Saints and holy Angels
   prostrated themselves before Your throne to ask You for a single degree
   more of grace or of glory than You have destined for me I should refuse
   it, because I prefer to remain exactly and simply, Oh my God, in the
   position You have been pleased to ordain for me." I implore You, and
   this is my last word, never to have, in any of your actions any other
   motive than the pure love of God and His greater glory. At the same
   time you need not exclude motives of hope, and of fear, and whenever
   the Holy Spirit inspires you with these do not hesitate to entertain
   them, but pure love should reign in your heart above every other
   sentiment. You should desire, and very ardently, your salvation and
   perfection; but, even in this desire have the glory of God at heart
   much more than your own happiness. Nothing is more likely than this
   habit of mind to enable you to make great strides in virtue, and great
   merit. The smallest actions inspired by this love are beyond
   comparison, of more value than the greatest performed with other good
   motives. But do not forget that you will make the more certain progress
   the more pure love induces you to renounce yourself even in the
   smallest things. If it did not lead to this it would not be pure love.

   Be carefully on your guard against the snares that the enemy will lay
   in your path to make you forsake your good intentions. Do not seek for,
   nor expect from creatures anything but forgetfulness and contempt, and
   may the joy of resembling Jesus Christ your divine Example make this
   contempt dearer to you than all the glory of the world. Let no occasion
   escape, however slight it may be, of perfecting in you this divine
   likeness, and after having faithfully profited by these slight trials
   humble yourself for not being judged worthy of greater ones.

  Letter VI.--Rules for General Direction.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.

   General direction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. Do not burden yourself with vocal prayers besides those that are
   of obligation, but apply yourself especially to acquiring interior
   perfection and to mental prayer.

   2nd. It is very useful to try and prevent faults by acts of penance,
   but it would be better still to endeavour to expiate them after having
   committed them, than to multiply your penances in advance without real
   necessity.

   3rd. Moderate and supernaturalise your affection for those who are dear
   to you.

   4th. In order to excite yourself to fervour profit by the good examples
   and conservations of spiritual persons; but do not ever show contempt
   for, nor give way voluntarily to any dislike of others.

   5th. Do not be so much vexed with yourself for being so often at war
   with your miserable nature; heaven is worth all these combats. Perhaps
   they will soon end, and you will speedily gain a complete victory.
   After all, they pass away and our rest will be eternal. Remain then in
   peace and let your humility be always united to confidence.

   6th. Profit by bodily infirmities to strengthen your soul by the spirit
   of resignation to the will of God, and of union with Jesus Christ.

   7th. Be careful to die to yourself; to renounce your natural
   inclinations; to stifle on every occasion human passions and
   tenderness. This kind of mortification is most essential; it does not
   injure the health, and is more efficacious than corporal austerities in
   multiplying merits, and in realising the designs of God, Who desires
   you to belong to Him entirely and without reserve.

   8th. Labour to profit faithfully but peacefully by all the different
   states through which it pleases our Lord that you should pass for His
   glory, and your own perfection.

   9th. It is necessary that zeal for one's own advancement and for that
   of others under one's care should be earnest and energetic, but never
   restless, nor accompanied with anxiety and distrust.

   10th. Apply yourself to becoming more and more interior and aspire to
   all the perfection of your holy state by a perfect regularity. Humble
   yourself unceasingly before God so that He may render you victorious
   over yourself. You have need of a very powerful assistance to overcome
   your sensitiveness, and to destroy the fastidiousness natural to you,
   before you die, because these defects are the result of your character
   and temperament. True, this consideration somewhat excuses the faults,
   and excites the good God to compassion for His poor spouse, but
   nevertheless you must continue to fight so that even if your miserable
   pride and self-love are not absolutely destroyed before your last hour,
   death will, at any rate, find you at war with them, and trying to
   destroy them. Your principal weapons should be divine love, an infinite
   gratitude for Gods grace, complete confidence in Him and a profound
   contempt for yourself, but without discouragement, and in peace.

   You will derive ever-increasing strength in Holy Communion, in prayer,
   in humility, sweetness, patience, obedience, mortification, and above
   all in interior abnegation.

   11th. Illness and infirmities accepted in submission to the will of God
   with humble thanksgiving, and in union with Jesus Christ, are very
   useful to expiate the past and to weaken the old Adam; they help also
   to make us die spiritually to all things before having to die
   naturally, which death in ending our transient ills will make us enter,
   let us hope, into the enjoyment of eternal happiness. As this kind of
   penance is sent to us by God Himself, and as we are thus unable to
   mortify ourselves exteriorly, we must make up for it by interior
   mortification, applying ourselves more earnestly to the destruction of
   self-love, pride, fastidiousness, and criticism of others, all of which
   are its bad fruits. Finally endeavour to become humble and simple as a
   little child for the love of our Lord, in imitation of Him, and in a
   spirit of peace and recollection. If God finds this humility in us He
   will prosper His work in us Himself. Persevere in being faithful to
   grace for the greater glory of God and for the pure love of Him. All
   consists in loving well, and with all your heart and in all your
   employments, this God of all goodness.

   12th. According to our advance in the course of our earthly pilgrimage
   let us endeavour to increase in solid fervour, the perfection of our
   holy state, and the particular designs of God to our regard. When He
   grants us attractions and sensible devotion let us profit by them to
   attach ourselves more firmly to Him above all His gifts. But in times
   of dryness let us go on always in the same way, reminding ourselves of
   our poverty and also thinking that, perhaps, God wishes to prove our
   love for Him by these salutary trials.

   13th. Let us be really humble, occupied in correcting our own faults,
   without reflecting on those of others. Let us see Jesus Christ in all
   our neighbours, and then we shall have no difficulty in excusing them
   as well as helping them and taking care of them. His example ought to
   be sufficient; look at His patience with His disciples who were so
   rough and ignorant. Let us turn all our energies to glorifying God in
   ourselves and in those who think well of us. Let us live hidden in
   Jesus Christ and dead to all created things and to ourselves; without
   this, Jesus Christ will not deign to dwell in us, at any rate, not in
   the way He aims at, which is in absorbing all our human life in His
   divine life. Besides we must bear with ourselves also out of charity as
   we put up with others, humbling ourselves and punishing ourselves for
   our faults as soon as possible. While praying for ourselves, let us
   also pray for sinners who are our brethren.

  Letter VII.--Rules for Direction.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil (1731), on the same subject. Rules,
   etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister and very dear daughter in our Lord, may the peace of
   Jesus Christ be always with you.

   1st. I thank God for all the good thoughts with which He inspires you.
   As long as you keep this good intention of belonging to God without
   reserve, resigning yourself entirely to His good pleasure, and fearing
   neither dryness, darkness, temptation, nor destitution, all will turn
   to your spiritual profit.

   2nd. The fear of being mistaken about being at peace in the midst of
   interior troubles is very useless. What you unwittingly disclose to me
   proves that this peace is very real; it is the foundation of all else
   and a great grace which you must preserve at all costs. All the attacks
   and stratagems of the devil are aimed to make you lose it, or to
   diminish or, disturb it; but keep firm in faith and confidence through
   abandonment. Take care not to pledge yourself by vow to anything
   whatever.

   3rd. To be completely severed from creatures in the intention and the
   affections is a great favour which infallibly leads to pure love and
   divine union.

   4th. The secret presentiment of approaching death may come either from
   God or from the devil. If it detaches you more completely from all
   things, without disturbing you or creating discouragement and distrust,
   it comes from God; if not, it must be rejected, because all that comes
   from God has a good effect, and it is entirely from the effects that
   the spirit it proceeds from is discerned. All the repugnance that you
   feel is intended to detach you more completely from all human support,
   so that you may have none but God alone; your interior practices about
   this are very good. But I am surprised that you have not yet learnt
   that when God permits this darkness all feeling for good disappears
   like the sun during the night. All that can be done then is to remain
   firm and peaceful, waiting for the return of the sun and the dawn of
   day when all will be as usual. I give you permission to write one, two,
   three, or four letters during the year, and whenever, after imploring
   the help of God, you deem it necessary, and if I should think the same,
   I shall be very particular to reply to you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VIII.--Advice on Prayer.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen. Excellent advice on prayer, to
   souls called to a life of abandonment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. Apply yourself to prayer by a simple glance at the subject, that
   is to say by a single apprehension of its object, by faith without any
   reasoning.

   2nd. I advise you to pause longer on that which is most likely to
   humiliate you, and to destroy self-love. The more distressed you feel,
   and penetrated with a sense of your misery, the more disposed you will
   be to receive the gifts of God.

   3rd. Do not be uneasy about distractions, but when you perceive them,
   collect your mind and, above all, your heart by an act of faith in the
   presence of God, and in a holy repose. If that does not succeed you can
   only resign yourself. The state of distraction is often a cross more
   meritorious than the prayer itself, for it unites our will with the
   will of God Who is all our good.

   4th. The result of the prayer will prove its efficacy. Solid faith is
   incomparably better than faith that is sensibly felt, under its
   guidance the soul makes more rapid progress, and proceeds with greater
   certainty.

   5th. Hear Holy Mass with great recollection, and give yourself up to a
   boundless confidence in the divine goodness, while relying on the
   merits of the divine victim, Jesus Christ.

   6th. The way of dryness and aridity is greatly preferable to that of
   consolations, although it is painful. It is only in this way that solid
   virtue can be acquired; in the other way, the most apparently, perfect
   dispositions are subject to failure at the slightest breath of aridity
   or of temptation. God usually sends trials to those souls who have
   enjoyed for some time spiritual sweetness and consolation.

   7th. When it pleases the divine goodness to make a soul advance in the
   way of pure love, fear makes no impression on it. As fear is the
   forerunner of love, perfect love casts out fear, as St. Augustine says,
   following St. John. Those who are charged with the guidance of such a
   soul should carry out the designs of God by conducting it in the ways
   of love and confidence. If the occasion arises where fear is necessary
   for the avoidance of evil, God will certainly bestow it. Let this soul
   continue then to love without troubling about other things, and above
   all let it avoid all anxiety and perplexity, for this temptation is
   more to be feared than any other by those who follow this way. One must
   then always recommend them to keep, at all costs, interior peace, and
   to reject as an envoy of hell everything which tends to disturb, or
   diminish it. For the rest, know that the most perfect, is that which is
   the most simple, and the most simple, is that which contains the least
   of our own, the fewest ideas, imaginations and reasonings; in which one
   single feeling continues longer than the rest. The longer the feelings
   inspired by grace continue in the soul, the more will it become
   impressed with them, and the more easily will it act under their
   influence. That of divine love which contains in an eminent degree all
   other virtues should form its ordinary food; when it masters all the
   affections of the soul it will effect in it an enthusiasm and a sort of
   enchantment which will make it run in the ways of holiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IX.--Danger of Delusion Explained.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen (1731), on the same subject. The
   danger of delusion in the prayer of recollection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Always listen to that great interior Director, who alone can give light
   and strength to us in our necessities. Do not use books when He speaks
   interiorly. Let your main point be a holy repose in the divine
   presence; never leave it, do not break the sacred silence unless God
   gives you an attraction for some holy and useful colloquy, after which
   re-enter your fort and sanctuary which is no other than recollection
   and interior silence in the presence and the sight of your Beloved. In
   Him alone, and in this simple and sweet repose in God will you find all
   light, courage, strength, sweetness, patience, humility, resignation,
   peace and rest for your soul. I wish you all this to the highest
   perfection. Do not be afraid of darkness and dryness in prayer; when
   one knows how to unite one's will to the holy will of God, accepting
   all that He wills, one is safe and has everything. This is, according
   to St. Teresa, the most perfect prayer and the most perfect love. You
   did very wisely in explaining to the Rev. Fr. ------ the subject about
   which you write to me. I have so much respect for his views that I
   should consider myself mistaken, if mine were opposed to his. I have
   always thought, with him, that no one ought to meddle with the prayer
   of recollection unless he be called to it, and also that this grace
   cannot be merited by good works, nor can anyone succeed in it by any
   effort of his own. I have only added, with Fr. Surin and other authors,
   that one can, indirectly and beforehand, dispose oneself to receive
   this great gift of heaven by removing obstacles, first by a great
   purity of conscience, secondly by purity of heart, thirdly of spirit,
   and fourthly of intention which will carry a soul very far on the road
   to it; and that having so far disposed oneself, one ought by short and
   frequent pauses, as if waiting to listen, give free course to the
   interior spirit.

   Will you read this to the Rev. Fr., or send him this little paper if
   you are not able soon to see him to speak to? Tell him when you see
   him, I beg of you, that I consider him bound in conscience to disabuse
   in my name all those persons whom he considers to have been misled, and
   that I depend upon him in this matter as I do not know whom it
   concerns.

   But in order to proceed with all due discretion and the prudence
   necessary, I beg him first to be good enough to consider these two
   points.

   1st, That he ought to certify himself of the fact by gaining some
   knowledge of the interior state of the persons in question, because
   only to hear about it at second hand does not throw much light on a
   secret and altogether interior subject. But it may be said that these
   persons are known to be very imperfect and have been seen to commit
   many faults at which others have taken scandal. My reply to this is the
   second point. Experience in direction teaches us that beneath very
   imperfect appearances God often hides great interior virtues known only
   to Himself. Therefore I do not believe that these persons can be
   accused of being misled and mistaken in their manner of prayer,
   especially as it often happens that their faults and imperfections are
   grossly exaggerated by a want of charity or by still worse motives. I
   remember now that St. Teresa said, speaking of herself that this method
   of prayer was a subject of suspicion in her; and that what made it seem
   a mistake and delusion of the devil was that the most enlightened
   persons whom she consulted could not reconcile in their minds such a
   gift of prayer with her conduct at that time; that is to say, with her
   eagerness to go to the parlour, to know, to see, and to be seen, to
   chatter with relations and worldly acquaintance, thus losing a great
   deal of time and neglecting her soul; for she herself tells us that
   this was, then, her state: "And this," she adds, "is why all who knew
   me considered my prayer to be nothing but delusion." With regard to
   this I have come across directors who have had experience about it, and
   they said that God sometimes gives this prayer. 1st, To great sinners
   at the beginning of their conversion, in order that this work of their
   conversion should be more speedily and completely effected.

   2nd, To very imperfect souls to enable them to correct their failings
   more easily and promptly. But what is added, and what I believe to be
   very true and correct is, that it is extremely rare to find this gift
   retained at the same time as faults, and considerable imperfections,
   especially if these be habitual, frequent, and recognised, without any
   efforts being made to correct them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter X.--Delusions in Prayer.

   On the same subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is my reply about the person in question. It seems to me that her
   prayer of recollection is more from the mind than from the heart. It is
   the opposite of what it should be, for in order that prayer be fruitful
   the heart should have a greater share in it than the intellect, in fact
   it is entirely a prayer of love; the soul resting in God loves Him
   without the knowledge of that which it loves, nor how this love is
   produced in it. But the reality of it is manifested by a certain warmth
   it feels in the heart, by an irresistible attraction to this divine
   centre, which it seeks without seeing distinctly what it pursues, and
   to which it yields, and from which nothing can distract it. From this
   arises the great facility of this prayer which is a sweet rest for the
   heart, and continues without effort for as long as it is desired.
   Therefore, if the person of whom you speak experiences as a
   preliminary, a great exertion of the mind, it is a sign that her
   recollection is not yet what it should be. The remedy for this seems to
   me to be, 1st, When carried away by this great recollection to
   concentrate the attention on the movements and affections of the heart,
   as if to retain and enjoy this delightful repose; there is such a charm
   about this feeling of sweetness and joy that it engrosses the whole
   attention of the soul, which thus understands better that it loves;
   while the mind without effort, and almost without voluntary
   application, finds itself captivated by this feeling which is, as it
   were, the food of the heart.

   2nd, If, notwithstanding all efforts to the contrary, the intensity of
   thought continues, forbid this person to spend more than two hours, at
   most, in prayer; and during her reading, and at other times, tell her
   not to purposely try to get recollection, but only to give herself up
   to it when God impels her, remembering always to fix her attention
   interiorly on the affections of her heart, to enjoy in them, at
   leisure, this sweetness, delightful repose and interior peace. 3rd,
   Tell her always to employ a little time to examine how her prayer was
   made; at its beginning, in its progress and at its conclusion; that is
   to say, firstly, what form did the recollection take? secondly, if it
   produced in her distinct thoughts and feeling, or, if this sweet sleep
   was too profound to enable her to remember anything? thirdly, how she
   felt when this state ceased; for example did it leave her in a state of
   great recollection, with a great desire to act rightly, to attach
   herself entirely to God, and to please her divine Master only? Let us
   be thoroughly persuaded that we can find God everywhere without the
   least effort; because He is truly present to those who seek Him with
   all their hearts, although they may not be always aware of His
   presence.

   Therefore whenever you are no longer occupied with created things so
   that you have ceased to think any more about them, know that your soul
   is then occupied by God, and in God without your knowledge. And this is
   the reason: God, being that hidden and invisible object to which tend
   all the desires of a right heart; from the moment it turns its desires
   away from creatures, they then find their natural centre, which is God;
   and by continually dwelling in this centre they gradually increase
   until they become very distinctly felt and produce strong outbursts of
   love. Therefore the true presence of God is, to speak plainly, but a
   kind of forgetfulness of creatures with an interior desire to find God.
   You thus perceive in what consists the divine interior and exterior
   silence, so precious, so desirable, and so advantageous; true earthly
   paradise in which souls who love God already enjoy a foretaste of
   heavenly happiness.

  Letter XI.--The Impressions of the Holy Spirit.

   To Mother Louise-Françoise de Rosen (1735), on the practice of
   abandonment in the different states of the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Peace in our Saviour Jesus Christ. When we are attentive and docile to
   the interior spirit, it guides us so surely that we very rarely make
   false steps. I commend, however, the wise precaution of occasionally
   explaining oneself to the priests of Jesus Christ in a spirit of
   self-distrust. God has so greatly blessed this humility in you that I
   was almost inclined to write only, "All is well, go on as you are
   doing." However, for your consolation I will add what God may inspire
   after a re-perusal of your letter. I admire what you say--"I do not
   care to speak, nor to write, nor to read much." This alone indicates a
   spirit usually well occupied interiorly; and a good spiritual writer
   has said of such a one that without working it is well occupied.
   Another calls this happy disposition, holy leisure, a holy idleness, in
   which although apparently doing nothing, everything is done, in saying
   nothing, all is said.

   1st. I find nothing but what is good in the three dispositions you
   experience alternately; firstly of faith, secondly of tastes and
   feelings, thirdly of subversion and suffering; but their value differs.
   The first is the most simple, the most certain, and is less favourable
   to the growth of self-love; the second is more pleasant and requires a
   great detachment from all taste and feeling even from that which is
   divine, so as to attach yourself solely and purely to God, as Fénélon
   expresses it. The third is painful, and often very crucifying, but then
   it is also the best, because all that mortifies the interior purifies
   it, and consequently disposes it for a more intimate union with the God
   of all purity, and of all sanctity.

   2nd. Thanks to the goodness of God you behave very well in all these
   states, and have only to go on in the same way; but you explain
   yourself in a manner that might be misunderstood by those who have no
   experience of this state of prayer. You say that you do nothing; yet
   you must all the time be at work, otherwise your state would be one of
   mere laziness; but your soul acts so quietly that you do not perceive
   your own interior acts of assent and adhesion to the impressions of the
   Holy Spirit. The stronger these impressions are, the less is it
   necessary to act; you must only follow your attraction and allow
   yourself to be led quite calmly, as you so well express it.

   3rd. Your way of acting in times of trouble and distress, gives me
   great pleasure. To be submissive, to abandon yourself entirely without
   reserve, to be content with being discontented for as long as God wills
   or permits will make you advance more in one day than you would in a
   hundred spent in sweetness and consolation. It is a good, beautiful and
   solid practice. Teach it to all, and especially to poor Sister N.
   Properly speaking she only requires this one point--and this constantly
   practised by her will sanctify her, and sweeten all her spiritual
   trials: with this single practice she will become a different being, as
   if she had been remodelled and transformed.

   4th. Your total abandonment to God, constant and universal as it is,
   and practised in a spirit of confidence, and of union with Jesus Christ
   doing always the will of His Father, is, of all practices the most
   divine and the most certain to succeed: try to instil it into everyone,
   especially the good Sister of whom I have just spoken.

   5th. The grace and light which enable you to combat and to stifle the
   feelings of nature on every occasion of which you have told me, deserve
   to be especially retained. Care and fidelity in corresponding fully
   with these graces even on the smallest occasions will serve to increase
   them; but never expect to be free from feeling the first movements,
   they will help to keep alive interior humility which is the foundation
   and guardian of every virtue.

   6th. As to your ordinary faults you must know that directly our
   imperfections are really displeasing to us, and that we are sincere
   resolved to combat them without exception, from that moment there is no
   longer any affection for them in the heart; and consequently no
   obstacle to our union with God. Therefore what we ought to work at with
   all our strength is, to diminish the number of these faults and
   imperfections. If, however, we fall again through frailty, surprise, or
   otherwise, we should at once courageously rise again and return to God
   with the same confidence as if nothing had happened, and having humbled
   ourselves in His presence, beg His forgiveness without feelings of
   vexation, anxiety, or agitation. Humility will supply for the want of
   fidelity, and often makes good our faults with advantage to ourselves.
   Finally should there be, with regard to your neighbour, any little
   reparation to be made, never omit the opportunity of generously
   overcoming pride and human respect by making it.

   7th. When you experience, involuntarily, the first irregular movements
   of any passion, give yourself time, before they are stifled by the help
   of grace, to thoroughly recognise to what lengths pride and passion
   would have carried you without such help. In this way you will acquire
   by personal experience a complete knowledge of that deep abyss of
   perversity into which you, like so many others, would fall if God did
   not uphold you. It is by this practical knowledge, these oft-repeated
   feelings, and frequent personal experiences, that all the saints learnt
   that profound and heartfelt humility, self-contempt and holy hatred of
   themselves of which we find so many proofs in the history of their
   lives and which formed the most solid foundation of their perfection.

   8th. With regard to your trials and temptations, I understand from all
   that you tell me, that the Holy Spirit has so well regulated your
   thoughts, feelings and conduct in these matters, both exteriorly and
   interiorly, that I have nothing further to add. In the marks of esteem
   and friendship that are shown to you without your own seeking, if they
   cause you annoyance instead of pleasure, then the pain and trouble will
   prove their own antidote. There could not be anything but great merit
   in suffering patiently in conformity to God's will and the arrangements
   of His providence and following the example of Jesus Christ,
   suspicions, rash judgments, envy, jealousy, etc., without attempting to
   clear yourself, except in so far as the edification of your neighbour
   enjoins. When you are exposed to all sorts of criticism and unjust
   accusations go on in your own way without making any change in your
   conduct, according to the pleasure of divine providence and keeping
   pace with His plans; this is truly to live by faith alone with God in
   the midst of the bustle and confusion of creatures. In such a condition
   exterior things can never penetrate to the interior, and neither
   flattery nor contempt can disturb the peace that you enjoy. This is to
   live a truly interior life. As long as this state of independence has
   not been acquired, virtues that have a most attractive appearance are
   not really solid, but very superficial, and liable to be overthrown by
   the faintest breath of inconstancy or contradiction.

   9th. Be well on your guard against all these illusions which aim at
   making you follow your own ideas, and prefer yourself to others. The
   spirit of self-sufficiency and criticism of one's neighbour seems to
   many persons a mere trifle; but it is nevertheless undeniable that this
   spirit is much opposed to religious simplicity, and that it hinders a
   great many souls from attempting an interior life. It is not possible,
   in fact, to begin this life without the help of the Holy Spirit, who
   only communicates Himself to the humble, the simple, and those who are
   little in their own eyes.

   10th. Your way of resisting all sorts of temptation; profound, gentle,
   simple, and almost imperceptible as it is, is a pure grace from God:
   keep to it; that simple look at God is worth infinitely more than any
   other sort of act. The peaceful doubts you experience after the
   temptation has ceased are caused by a chaste fear which you must never
   lay aside; as for anxious doubts born of self-love, they must be
   despised and driven away. With regard to the rest, there is nothing
   easier to recognise, and discover, than the deceits and illusions
   incident to the prayer of faith, and of simple recollection; and that
   by the infallible rule of Jesus Christ; the tree is known by its
   fruits. Therefore all prayer that produces reformation of the heart,
   amendment of life, the avoidance of vice, the practice of the
   evangelical virtues and the duties of one's state, is a good prayer.
   Also all prayer which does not produce these fruits, or which produces
   their opposite, is a false prayer and produces the fruit of a bad tree,
   even were it accompanied by raptures, ecstasies and miracles. The paths
   that lead us to God are those of faith, charity and humility, therefore
   all that makes its walk in these paths is useful to us, and whatever
   leads us away from them is dangerous and hurtful. This is the safest
   and most infallible rule to prevent and reform all that is evil, all
   that is illusory, and it is within everyone's power.

   I greet, very cordially, your good Sister. Please tell her from me to
   allow herself to be always guided by the interior spirit, and thus to
   be ready, as she is, to abandon herself completely into the hands of
   God, equally content when He gives, or when He takes away, and with
   that apparent nothing that He leaves her; as it pleases Him. In this is
   all perfection and the true progress of a faithful soul. How pleasing
   you must be to God in recommending so unceasingly to His spouses this
   holy abandonment which alone can unite them entirely to Him.

  Letter XII.--Peace and Submission.

   On the practice of abandonment and the peace of the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear Sister,

   May the peace of Jesus Christ be always with us, and in us, since God
   does not act freely except in peaceful hearts. I rejoice, and
   congratulate you on the peace that our Lord gives you in the practice
   of an entire conformity of your will to the designs of His good
   providence. This peace, as you know, is the foundation of the interior
   life for many reasons, but principally because it is the health and
   strength of the soul; as trouble produces languor and weakness, acting
   on the soul in the same way that fever acts on the body. In the second
   place, because agitation and anxiety in the soul are an obstacle to the
   hearing of the gentle voice and soft breathing of the Holy Spirit. To
   keep yourself in this peace which will, I hope, continually increase,
   there is no better way than always to practise total abandonment, and
   that absolute resignation of which I have already spoken to you. You
   will, without doubt, succeed, if you never lose sight of the great and
   consoling truth that nothing happens in this world but by the command
   of God, or at least, with His divine permission; and that, whatever He
   wills, or permits turns infallibly to the advantage of those who are
   submissive and resigned. Even that which most disturbs our spiritual
   plans changes into something better for us. Keep firmly by this great
   principle and the most violent tempests will not be able to trouble the
   depth of your soul, even though they map ruffle the surface by
   disquieting the feelings.

   When, in prayer, you experience certain inclinations and a sweet repose
   of soul and heart in God, receive these gifts with humility and
   gratitude, but without attaching yourself to them. If you liked these
   consolations for themselves you would compel God to deprive you of
   them, for, when He calls us to pray it is not to flatter our self-love,
   or to cause us to feel complacency in ourselves, but to dispose us to
   do His holy will, and to teach us to conform ourselves always more
   perfectly and in all things to it. When distractions and dryness follow
   consolations, you know how you ought to bear them, I mean, in peace,
   submission, and abandonment for as long as it pleases God to permit
   them to continue. You know, also, that the only hurtful distractions
   are those that are voluntary, therefore, all those that are displeasing
   do not prevent the prayer of the heart, and the desire. Do not ever
   force yourself to fight against these obstinate distractions, it is
   better and safer to let them alone, as one takes no notice of the
   various follies and extravagancies that, in spite of ourselves pass
   through the mind and imagination. What has happened to you before will
   happen again; God will cause you to experience after prayer what He has
   refused you at the time in order to make you understand that it is the
   effect of His grace alone and not of any effort or industry of yours.
   Nothing serves better to keep us in dependence on grace, and in a state
   of abjection in our own eyes: and this produces humility of heart and
   mind. During the day try to keep yourself united to God, either by
   frequent aspirations towards Him, or by the simple glance of pure
   faith; or better still, by a certain calm in the depths of your soul
   and of your whole being in God, accompanied by a complete detachment
   from all the exterior objects of this world. God Himself will show you
   which of these three ways will best suit you to unite yourself to Him,
   by the attraction to it, the taste for it, and the facility in the
   practice of it which He will give you, for this union is in proportion
   to the degree of to which the soul is raised. Each of these states has
   its special attraction; one must learn to know one's own, and then
   follow it with simplicity and fidelity, but without anxiety,
   uneasiness, or haste; always sweetly and peacefully as St. Francis of
   Sales says.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIII.--Peace and Confidence.

   On the same subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What you tell me about the peace and tranquillity you experience has
   given me great pleasure. You must remember all your life that one of
   the principal reasons why certain souls do not advance is, because the
   devil continually throws them into a state of uneasiness, perplexity,
   and anxiety which makes them incapable of applying themselves
   seriously, quietly, and with constancy to the practice of virtue. The
   great principle of the interior life is the peace of the soul, and it
   must be preserved with such care that the moment it is attacked all
   else must be put aside and every effort made to try and regain this
   holy peace, just as, in an outbreak of fire everything else is
   neglected to hasten to extinguish the flames. Read, from time to time,
   the treatise on the peace of the soul which is to be found at the end
   of the little book called "The Spiritual Combat," and which the ancient
   fathers very truly called "the road to Paradise," to make us understand
   that the high road to Heaven is this happy peace of the soul. The
   reason of this is that peace and tranquillity of mind alone give great
   strength to the soul, to enable it to do all that God wises, while, on
   the other hand, anxiety and uneasiness make the soul feeble and
   languid, and as though sick. Then one feels neither taste for, nor
   attraction to virtue, but, on the contrary, disgust and discouragement
   of which the devil does not fail to take advantage. For this reason he
   uses all his cunning to deprive us of peace, and under a thousand
   specious pretexts, at one time about self-examination, or sorrow for
   sin, at another about the way we continually neglect grace, or that by
   our own fault we make no progress; that God will, at last, forsake us,
   and a hundred other devices from which very few people can defend
   themselves. This is why masters of the spiritual life lay down this
   great principle to distinguish the true inspirations of God from those
   that emanate from the devil; that the former are always sweet and
   peaceful inducing to confidence and humility, while the latter are
   intense, restless, and violent, leading to discouragement and mistrust,
   or else to presumption and self-will. We must, therefore, constantly
   reject all that does not show signs of peace, submission, sweetness and
   confidence, all of which bear, as it were, the impression of the seal
   of God; this point is a very important one for the whole of our life.
   You ask me for some rules by which to regulate the thoughts of the mind
   during the day--to which I answer:

   1st. That it is better to approach God and virtue by the affections of
   the heart than by the thoughts of the mind, and it is an important
   counsel to nourish the heart and make the mind fast; that is to say, to
   desire God, sigh after God, long for the holy love of God, for an
   intimate union with God, without amusing yourself with so many thoughts
   and reflexions. Therefore it is more useful to occupy yourself with the
   affair of belonging to God without reserve; with the desire to lead an
   interior life, with a profound humility, fervour, the gift of prayer,
   the love of God, the true spirit of Jesus Christ, and with the practice
   of those virtues which He taught by word, and His divine example, than
   to make a thousand useless reflexions about them. If you do not feel
   any of these desires the mere wish to have them, the mere raising of
   the heart is sufficient to keep your soul recollected and united to
   God. Therefore, once more, the mere raising of the heart to God, or
   towards certain virtues in order to please God, will do more to help
   you on than all your reflexions and grand reasoning.

   This is called being led to God by inclination, attraction and
   affection; and this way is gentler, surer, and more efficacious than
   all those beautiful lights, unless, indeed, God infuses them by His
   grace and special favour; and even then, unless these lights are united
   to a certain taste and an interior attraction which touches and charms
   the heart, we usually make no progress.

   2nd. God often permits souls to suffer from that emptiness of the mind
   of which I have spoken before, and in such cases it would be useless to
   wish to have distinct thoughts since God has deprived us of them. It
   would even be hurtful to make efforts to think or to reflect much; from
   which I conclude that, in any state it is better to remain before God
   peacefully, acquiescing heartily in His will as to what He gives or
   takes away without doing more than retaining in the depths of the soul
   a sincere desire to belong entirely to God; to love Him ardently and to
   be ultimately united to Him, or else, as I have explained, to wish to
   have these desires.

   3rd. As God gives lights and thoughts when He pleases, either in
   prayer, or at other times; if you find that these lights and thoughts
   come quietly and gently, you can dwell upon them for as long a time as
   you feel any attraction or repose, content to let them go whenever God
   pleases, without making any effort to retain them; otherwise it would
   seem as if they were your own, and would act against that perpetual
   dependence in which God wills to keep those souls which He calls to the
   interior life. And it is especially to keep them in this continual
   dependence that, sometimes, God does nothing but give and take away in
   turns, almost unceasingly; and this produces in those souls perpetual
   changes. It is through these different changes and constant
   vicissitudes that God Himself exercises these souls in a perfect
   submission of mind and heart in which consists true perfection. The
   conduct of God in the interior of the souls He loves and wishes to
   raise to a perfect and solid virtue somewhat resembles that of a wise
   and firm mother who, to overcome the obstinacy and self-will of her
   child, and to make him perfectly submissive and obedient, gives, and
   takes away again what he likes best, and continues to do so until she
   has overcome his rebellious spirit. Oh! if we could only understand the
   loving conduct of God, what peace would be ours, and what submission we
   should practise in the midst of these spiritual vicissitudes and
   changes of the interior state. From this I draw the conclusion which I
   have often explained to you before that, in certain circumstances, the
   most efficacious way of making spiritual progress is the simple one of
   acquiescing in the will of God. "I agree to all, Lord, I wish what You
   wish, I resign myself entirely to Your will." This is called desiring
   nothing and being prepared for everything; nothing for oneself, and
   everything by resignation: it is called walking before God in the
   greatest simplicity. This method, in a certain sense has nothing
   disturbing about it, because this simple adhesion of our will to the
   will of God comes almost spontaneously as a drawing and attraction, and
   finally as a sweet habit.

   You are surprised that having heartily made certain sacrifices for God,
   temptations about them should return, most violently, so as to cause
   you anxiety. It is necessary that this should happen, to prevent
   self-complacency and self-love which would spoil all. Be satisfied,
   then, that God has inclined you in the first place by His grace to make
   these sacrifices for Him, and firmly resist the temptations to retract
   them. God intends through them to keep you humble; the mind is
   naturally so inclined to vaunt itself and to be puffed up about
   everything and to appropriate to itself all that is good and virtuous
   by self-complacency, that without the help of these oft-repeated trials
   of our misery and feebleness we should flatter ourselves to have had a
   great share in the victory, and should thus lose all the fruit we might
   have gained. In withdrawing from the truth of our own nothingness we go
   on in vanity and lies which are so opposed to God who is essential
   truth.

   Thus it is that the actual and almost unintermittent experience of our
   own weakness becomes the protection of those virtues that faith makes
   us practise. From this it happens that according to the progress we
   make God gives us corresponding light, and a more lively realisation of
   our misery and poverty, to retain in us the treasures of grace and
   virtue of which our enemies would deprive us if God did not bury them
   in an abyss of misery well known to ourselves, and keenly apprehended
   by us. This will enable you to understand how it happens that the most
   saintly persons are always the most humble, and have the poorest
   opinion of themselves. It is because, by our great inclination to
   vanity we compel God to hide from our own eyes the small amount of good
   that we do by the help of His grace, and all our spiritual progress and
   the virtues He bestows upon us without our knowledge. This is a very
   touching proof, not only of our own misery, but also of the wisdom and
   goodness of our God, who is reduced, so to speak, to hiding from us His
   greatest benefits for fear that we should love them and appropriate
   them by vanity and scarcely perceptible self-satisfaction. From this
   great rule it follows that our wretchedness, thoroughly well recognised
   and experienced, is worth more to us than an angelic virtue the merit
   of which we unjustly attribute to ourselves. This rule, deeply engraved
   in the soul, keeps it always in peace in the midst of a lively
   realisation of its misery, since it regards these feelings as very
   great graces from God, as indeed they are.

  Letter XIV.--Singular Favours of God.

   To Sister Anne-Marguerite Boudet de la Bellière (1734). On the practice
   of abandonment during consolations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   What you tell me about the extraordinary circumstances attending your
   vocation is more useful than you imagine, because a director who
   recognises a call of Providence in a vocation has the right to conclude
   that God has special designs on the soul so singularly chosen, and that
   He desires to find in it a devotion proportioned to the predilection He
   has shown it. I thank God for the first grace, and still more for the
   second which consists in making you know and appreciate this singular
   favour. I conclude from these favours that you are of the fortunate
   number of those from whom God expects a particular fidelity, and who
   would run a great risk if they failed to correspond to the loving
   kindness of their heavenly Spouse, or if they wounded the divine
   jealousy of His love. It is true that in the interior life you must be
   prepared for continual vicissitudes. This is the law to which all the
   transitory things of this life are subjected by God, and this law is so
   universal that to remain always in the same state must be looked upon
   with suspicion. What must you do now, then, that God is overwhelming
   you with lights and caresses?

   1st. You must wait, and prepare yourself for the distressing absences
   of your Spouse: also in His absence you must look forward to His
   return, and sustain yourself with the hope of it.

   2nd. You must not give yourself up too completely to these affections
   and consolations for fear of becoming attached to them. You should use
   the same moderation and the same sobriety with regard to them as a
   mortified person does with regard to the dishes at a feast.

   3rd. Your present method of prayer is more a gift of grace than your
   own. Therefore let grace act, and remain in a position of humble
   docility, keeping with calmness and simplicity your interior glance
   fixed lovingly on God, and on your own nothingness. God will then
   effect great things in your soul without your knowledge either as to
   what they are, or how He works. Be careful not to give way to
   curiosity; be content to know and to feel that it is a divine
   operation, trust Him who works in you and abandon yourself entirely to
   Him so that He may form and fashion you interiorly as best pleases Him.
   Is it not enough that you should be to His liking and taste?

   4th. During these happy moments have no other fear than that of
   becoming more attached to these gifts and graces than to the Giver and
   Benefactor. Do not value nor enjoy these graces and favours except in
   so far as they serve to inflame your soul with divine love, and are
   useful to help you in acquiring those solid virtues which please your
   heavenly Lover: self-abnegation, humility, mortification, patience,
   sweetness, obedience, charity, and gentle forbearance with your
   neighbour. Know that the devil is not the author of favours such as
   these, and that he can never deceive you if you only make use of these
   tastes and attractions for the acquisition of those solid virtues which
   faith and the Gospel teach and prescribe for us. Let God act; do not by
   your natural activity place obstacles in the way of His holy
   operations, and be faithful to Him in the smallest things for fear of
   exciting or provoking His divine jealousy.

   5th. The most simple thoughts, and those that lead more directly to a
   filial confidence are the best in prayer. How pleasing to God are those
   prayers that are, at the same time, simple, familiar, and respectful,
   and how irresistible they are to Him. I wish you, with all my heart, a
   continuation of this simple and humble gift of prayer which is the
   greatest treasure of the spiritual life.

   6th. You say that you cannot understand how the strong antipathy that
   you formerly entertained for your present state of life should have
   given place to such a perfect love of it. It is, my dear Sister,
   because, by different interior operations, your soul has, so to say,
   been re-modelled, somewhat in the way that an old metal or silver pot
   is re-cast to make an entirely new one, shining and bright. There will
   be many other remouldings in your soul if you become quite detached
   from consolations, faithful to grace, and completely resigned to God's
   good pleasure in aridity, trouble and desolation.

   7th. I feel, as you do, that it is God's will that, little by little,
   you should die to all things, in order to live only in Him, for Him,
   and by Him; that is to say, to have neither thoughts, desires, plans,
   views, ambitions, affections, joys, fears, hope, nor love but for Him.
   But before arriving at this entire detachment, which is what is called
   a mystical death, you will have to endure cruel agonies. From
   henceforth you must prepare yourself for this, as, in bygone times the
   virgins, and the rest of the faithful prepared themselves for
   martyrdom, because this is in reality a true martyrdom beginning in
   love, and tending to the consummation of love. But be of good courage;
   God will uphold you and will give you now and then, breathing-space for
   the enjoyment of heavenly graces and of a delightful sweetness with
   which He will fill your soul as with a heavenly manna to nourish and
   fortify it during its sojourn in the desert of this world.

   8th. What a fortunate attraction it is which unceasingly recalls you
   interiorly! What a holy dwelling, and blessed retreat has the heavenly
   Spouse made for Himself in your soul, where He makes Himself known to
   you and speaks to your heart in the most profound and loving silence,
   without sound of words, or confusion of fugitive thoughts! This should
   be your permanent dwelling and when you perceive yourself on the point
   of quitting it, try very gently to return, and to re-enter this divine
   trysting-place. It is in this that it is most necessary for you to be
   faithful.

   9th. As concerns your extreme weakness and misery during times of
   aridity, and in the absence of the heavenly Bridegroom, you need not be
   in the least surprised at it and still less excessively afflicted or
   troubled. All good souls suffer in the same way, and God acts thus to
   remind us, by a hundred personal experiences, that we are nothing
   without Him, so that we shall attribute to Him alone all the glory of
   the little good that we perform by the help of His grace, and
   appropriate nothing to ourselves but evil.

   10th. During this time that immediately follows the entrance of a soul
   into the state of recollection, you would hardly believe how necessary
   it is, not only to deny itself every useless pleasure and natural
   satisfaction, but also conversations, even pious ones, that are too
   long. It is often a device of the devil to feed pride, self-love, and
   foolish self-esteem, and to draw us gradually away till we forget God
   even in speaking about Him and about our own souls. We escape this
   danger when by continual efforts we have acquired a habit of living an
   interior life, and become accustomed to let the heart speak, rather
   than the intellect.

   11th. Preserve most jealously a great taste for silence and solitude:
   the desire of it is enough for the present, and later, the time will
   come to put it into practice.

   12th. It is certain, also, that familiar correspondence by letter, even
   in the most harmless way, is an obstacle to perfection, especially in
   youth. One of your former directors has already given you this advice
   and you did well in obeying him. This little sacrifice was very
   pleasing to God, and will have obtained for you the grace to make a
   second which I judge necessary. I see that it is incumbent on you to
   make continual progress in the way of detachment, and also that the
   special graces bestowed on you by God give Him the right to expect a
   corresponding fidelity on your part. After weighing the matter well in
   the sight of God, and in the interests of your soul this is what I
   think; I wish you to tell the person quite simply, that your director,
   whose advice you wish to follow, tells you that this letter-writing,
   though of the most innocent description, must be given up, as a little
   sacrifice which he desires and exacts, although he knows quite well
   that there is no danger either on your side or the other, as you have
   declared that the correspondence is with an upright man, a good
   Religious who is a relative: and that in spite of knowing all this the
   director is firm, and will maintain his prohibition, under the penalty
   of refusing any longer to undertake the care of your soul and that you
   neither wish nor dare to disobey him. I believe that this declaration,
   made with quiet energy will suffice to give your soul its full liberty.

   13th. I thoroughly understand the miserable self-love of which you
   speak, and its natural result in the instinctive and indeliberate
   seeking after your own ease and comfort. This self-love is so deeply
   rooted in us, that only its opposite, divine love, can cause its death.
   It is enough, at present, to grieve about it, and to humble yourself
   before God. The prayer He gives you is a sacred fire which will
   insensibly consume all these evil inclinations, as fire consumes straw;
   so, have confidence in God, and wait patiently till this wretched straw
   is completely consumed.

  Letter XV.--Heartfelt Prayer.

   To Mother Louise-Françoise de Rosen on the same subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I see no cause for anxiety in the state of your soul as you describe it
   in your letter.

   1st. The feelings of gratitude, of joy, and of self-effacement which
   keep you in union with God for entire days without any relaxation are
   the effects of one of those operations which you have already
   experienced. You have but to accept this gift with humble gratitude,
   and I can only congratulate you on the grace God has bestowed on you.

   2nd. There is a language of the heart which only God can understand,
   and which is expressed by desires and other interior movements, as men
   converse with the void and articulate words. This is called heartfelt
   prayer altogether interior and spiritual. In this the Holy Spirit, in
   the inmost sanctuary of the soul, listens, speaks, instructs, silences,
   turns and forms it according to His pleasure. It is the work of the
   divine Spirit on the created spirit of which the soul hardly
   understands anything, apparently, and yet, nevertheless, is completely
   revived by the impressions made upon it. In this also, it only remains
   to receive in all simplicity the gift of God, and since it pleases Him
   to communicate Himself to the soul in secret, and as it were,
   "incognito," it should carefully abstain from opposing His designs by
   eager investigations or indiscreet curiosity.

   3rd. Your thoughts and feelings about the happiness of the saints are
   founded on truth, for it is of faith that the essence of that sovereign
   happiness is but the ebbing and flowing of the very happiness of God. A
   small share of this happiness He imparts to certain souls here on
   earth, to attract them to Himself, and to inspire them with a distaste
   for all else; so transitory impressions have their good effect, for
   which reason we are permitted to desire, and to enjoy them with
   interior moderation and sobriety.

   4th. The comparison of the stone which has to be cut with blows of the
   hammer on the chisel, and afterwards to be polished, is very just. You
   have only to allow yourself to be shaped and modelled, and to be
   careful not to destroy the form and shape given by the divine Workman,
   by thoughts and actions that obviate His industry.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVI.--The Operations of Grace.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen (1734). The operations of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I have read your letter with much consolation and spiritual joy. I
   bless God from my heart for having been pleased to glorify Himself in
   your weakness and poverty. We celebrate to-day the feast of St. Agatha,
   and in her collect we pray that as He has chosen the weaker sex to show
   forth His mighty power, so we might by her intercession be brought
   nearer to Him. I have applied this thought to you.

   1st. Your great attraction towards simplicity is a grace that can have
   no other effect than to unite you more closely with God, for simplicity
   tends to unity, and this can be obtained, first, by a simple and loving
   interior looking to God in pure faith, whether this interior looking is
   perceptible by its sweetness, as at present, or becomes almost unknown
   to the senses by being in the depths of the soul, or in the apex, or
   point of the spirit. Secondly, by keeping guard over all your interior
   senses in a profound silence. Thirdly, by only making repeated acts and
   reflections according as God gives you the thought, attraction, and
   impulsion.

   2nd. This indistinct knowledge, or rather, this strong impression that
   you have of the immensity of God is the work of grace, which produces,
   and leaves in the depth of the soul very salutary effects that no one
   has ever been able to explain, and on which it is best not to reason
   nor even to dwell unless God, Himself, impels us. Do not interfere with
   this impression, nor distress yourself when it pleases God to take it
   away. The soul will thus be prevented from becoming more attached to
   the gifts of God than to God Himself, and from ruining all the
   operations of grace by attributing the good effects they produce to
   itself.

   3rd. The holy Scripture says that God dwells in inaccessible darkness
   to the spirit of man, but when He introduces a soul into that darkness
   it becomes luminous to it. Then can it see all without seeing anything,
   it can hear all without hearing, and gain knowledge without knowing
   anything. This is called wise ignorance, or, as St. Denis explains it,
   the darkness of the light of faith. All that is necessary to know about
   it is that it is an operation of grace; allow yourself to be immersed
   in it with joy, let yourself be engulfed and lost in it as much as God
   pleases.

   4th. This attraction to and taste for mental prayer, and this profound
   peace and silence full of admiration and love are marked effects of the
   prayer of recollection. But to remain in a kind of inactivity, like an
   empty space, or a mere instrument waiting for the master-hand of the
   worker, is another operation of grace. In this state you have only to
   follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Wait patiently in silence and
   resignation, as the holy king, David, said, "Like a servant waits with
   her eyes fixed on her mistress to forestall and accomplish her commands
   at the least sign from her"; if nothing is said, still wait in the same
   interior spirit of submission and abandonment. Should grace inspire
   particular and formal acts, perform them quietly, following step by
   step the impulse given for that purpose, and stop directly it ceases,
   to resume once more the same silent attention.

   5th. This spirit of total abandonment, with the fervent and reiterated
   petition to accomplish all that God wills frequently prognosticates a
   transition to an interior state of trial extremely hard and crucifying.
   All that can be done is to prepare yourself generally, before God, by a
   complete self-distrust and a great confidence in Him; and by a general
   abandonment to all without particularising anything unless God makes it
   clear to you. On this subject I say to you that if for want of tyrants
   there are no longer martyrs for the faith to the shedding of blood;
   Jesus Christ will continue to have martyrs of grace. The torments of
   the body give place with advantage to the different interior sufferings
   which souls have to endure to purify them more and more and to render
   them better fitted for a more strict and intimate union with the God of
   all purity and holiness. The feeling of confusion and of interior
   annihilation is caused by the action of the Spirit of God; all the
   graces He gives us should always bear the sign-manual of humility, and
   all that has not this sign must be regarded with suspicion, and
   likewise everything that has the slightest shadow of pride,
   presumption, or vain self-satisfaction.

   6th. Having once experienced the sweetness, efficacy, and purity of the
   divine operations, I am not surprised at the sort of horror you
   entertain for your own efforts which are nearly always hurried, wild,
   uneasy, and followed by a thousand fruitless self-examinations. It is
   not a bad thing to remain inactive when you do not think yourself to be
   actuated by the Spirit of God; as long as one of these two conditions
   can be found in this state--that this inaction does not last long, or
   else that it is a peaceful waiting which is not idleness, since there
   is in it that interior and loving attention to God, with faith, desire,
   and hope of His holy operation, which are so many acts, and so many
   movements of the mind and heart, forming the essence of true interior
   prayer.

   You must not scrutinise spiritual things so much, but follow God with
   simplicity, as St. Francis of Sales says: "To do otherwise is to oppose
   the holy simplicity that pertains to candid and innocent souls."

   All that is caused by, or proceeds from the love of God, says your
   saintly Father, is sweet and gentle, like this very holy love itself;
   and the signs of a self-seeking nature are the confusion, haste, and
   anxiety of a self-love that is perpetually eager, anxious and
   impetuous.

   7th. I understand that your attraction has always been the knowledge
   and love of God in, and through Jesus Christ. The simple perception, or
   consideration of these mysteries, accompanied by holy affections, is
   already a very good method of prayer. When all the contemplation of the
   mind, and the affections of the heart are gathered into one point, for
   instance---the Deity, the prayer is much simplified, is better and more
   divine; but you must not imagine that this method will always continue:
   usually it is not a permanent state, but a fugitive grace. When it has
   passed, you must return to the simple contemplation of the mystery with
   some affections of the heart, gentle, peaceful, without effort or too
   much examination.

   8th. Be careful, during the time of prayer, not to reflect on yourself,
   or your method of prayer, because to examine closely in this way, one
   often leaves off looking at God to look at oneself, to reflect and, as
   it were, to turn back on oneself simply out of self-love which, not
   having been entirely given up, falls back naturally on itself. When
   divine repose begins, do not think of its sweetness but only of God in
   whose heart your soul should rather seek charity and the infusion of
   those virtues which fill the soul during that happy sleep, than its own
   repose. For the rest you could not hear Mass nor recite the Office in a
   more worthy manner than with these interior dispositions, but you must
   prepare to be weaned from the milk of spiritual infancy, and to eat the
   bread of the strong. May God be praised for this beforehand.

   9th. Certainly the more annihilated and empty of created things a soul
   becomes the greater will be its capacity for divine love, and the more
   abundantly will this love be infused into it. Then the soul drinks long
   draughts of love with a delicious satiety, and an insatiable thirst.
   One must then be content to drink at the source, and not make
   unseasonable commotion. Formal acts of charity would be greatly out of
   place when one feels that the heart is entirely submerged in charity.
   God wills that by dint of plunging and replunging your soul in this
   ocean of charity your heart may become inebriated with this holy love,
   and set on fire with these pure and divine flames. To attain this you
   must think of two things only--first to detach your mind and heart more
   and more from all created things, secondly to allow God to act, for He
   alone produced these effects in your soul. Still you can, and ought to
   desire, and to ask for a greater love of God, when you feel inclined,
   and impelled to do so; but this you will do almost without thinking and
   without being able to help yourself.

   10th. God carries out His work with any tools He pleases, and sometimes
   effects wonderful things with very weak instruments. Therefore do not
   deny yourself to those souls whom He has inspired to appeal to you: say
   quite simply what you think and give them what God has given you for
   their benefit, and rest assured that He will give His blessing to your
   simplicity, and to the humility of these good souls. When God sends
   someone to us in whatever way it may be, it is not meddling to help
   others, but the best way of showing our love and gratitude to Him. Even
   when they seem to repel you, stand your ground, and endure all for the
   glory of your great Master.

  Letter XVII.--Attraction to the Interior Life.

   To Mother Marie-Anne-Sophie de Rottembourg (1738). On docility to the
   interior impressions of the Holy Spirit: and peaceful waiting.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Reverend Mother,

   All that you tell me about the interior attraction of many of your
   daughters to holy recollection, and the measures you take to turn aside
   the obstacles, specious and well-disguised as they are, by which the
   devil tries to prevent them, can only come from the Holy Spirit. I have
   nothing further to remark about it. Follow quietly and step by step,
   the light that God gives you. What a consolation and joy for me it is
   to learn that all those good sisters whom I know best, and am most
   interested in, are just those that are most attracted to and have the
   greatest desire for the interior life. I beg you to congratulate them
   from me for this gift of God, and to greet them all, particularly your
   dear Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Vioménil. How delighted I am to hear
   that she is persevering in this work. The seven you mention, with whom
   you have formed a holy league for the renewal of an interior spirit in
   your community, will gradually make proselytes, and before long will
   win over the whole house. As to yourself, profit by your experiences
   and never forsake the plain path of pure faith which God has made you
   enter upon for any reason whatever. Do not forget that in this path the
   operations of God are almost imperceptible. The work of grace is
   accomplished in the innermost recess of the spirit, that which is the
   furthest from the senses, and from all that can be felt. To confirm you
   in this way you must remember first that this is what Jesus Christ
   meant when He said that we must worship the Father in spirit and in
   truth; secondly, that what is evident to the senses is, so to say, only
   a mark of grace; as Fr. Louis Lallement says; thirdly, that Mother de
   Chantal has very justly said that the more simple, deep and
   imperceptible are the workings of God, the more spiritual, solid, pure
   and perfect they are. That spirit of peace in yourself and in the
   others is one of the greatest gifts of God. Follow this spirit and all
   that it inspires; it will work wonders in yourself and in your
   neighbour. When we have learnt to remain in interior peace, God will
   teach others by our example without the sound of words to be peaceable
   and obedient, so that directors will only have to say to us, "Listen
   attentively to the voice of the Spirit of God," or, better still, "Be
   faithful in following the interior impressions of His grace." This is
   what St. John said to the first Christians, "You have no need that any
   man teach you, but as His unction teacheth you all things, and is
   truth, and is no lie. And as it has taught you, abide in Him." Follow
   faithfully and obediently, when you feel it, this divine unction; wait
   for it peacefully and with confidence when its impression becomes
   indistinct; this is the best way of making rapid progress in the way of
   perfection without danger of going astray. Why do we always wish to
   substitute our own action for that of the divine Worker who labours in
   us without ceasing to make us perfect? How much more progress should we
   not make if we took more care not to interfere with His action, but to
   abandon ourselves to Him, and to wait for Him? The Holy Scriptures
   frequently recommend us to "wait on the Lord" and there is hardly any
   means better calculated to make us holy. There is nothing to which
   souls already sufficiently exercised in the active life and the
   fulfilment of the precepts should more earnestly apply themselves, than
   to these peaceful waitings. It is the way to acquire the spirit of
   prayer, of holy recollection, and of a most intimate union with God.
   Our God is infinitely liberal, and His hands are always full of graces
   which He only desires to pour out on us. To receive abundantly of these
   graces all that is necessary is, to prepare our hearts and to remain
   always in readiness. But the dryness and weariness of this waiting tire
   those souls that are impatient and impetuous, and dishearten those who
   think only of their own interests instead of allowing themselves to be
   led by the pure love of God which consists in conforming our will
   always with His. There is no treasure in the world to be compared to
   this. But people are always rushing after all sorts of chimerical
   perfections and lose sight of the only true perfection, which is the
   fulfilment of the divine will; this infinitely wise and sweet will,
   which, if we allow it to guide us will show us close at hand and at
   every moment what we are so laboriously and uselessly hunting for
   elsewhere.

  Letter XVIII.--Desires to be Moderated.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Vioménil. Advising her to moderate her
   desires and fears.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Salutary fear causes neither disturbance, uneasiness, nor
   discouragement. If fear produce contrary effects you must drive it
   away, and not allow it to take possession of you, as in this case it
   comes either from the devil, or your own self-love. We must always
   remain in the presence of God, waiting His pleasure even about our most
   lawful desires, and the projects that seem most saintly; and must be
   always submissive and resigned to His holy will. Why? Firstly, because
   the desires of God should be the only rule of all our desires. The most
   certain way of arriving at perfection is to submit, and to persevere in
   adhering to all the interior and exterior circumstances in which we
   find ourselves by the permission of that divine Providence who rules
   everything, and disposes everything, even to the fall of a leaf from
   the tree, or a hair from our heads. Secondly, because the giving up of
   our own will is a necessary and important condition of our
   sanctification.

   Nothing is so calculated to make us acquire this abnegation than the
   delays we meet with in the execution of our good purposes. It is on
   this account that God often delays their accomplishment for entire
   years. Then, indeed, do we require faith, abandonment and confidence.
   But what makes this trial all the more bitter is that sometimes we do
   not feel that we have any of these virtues, because we are deprived of
   the power of making formal acts. What is to be done in this case? We
   must sustain ourselves by the simple light of bare faith, and by
   frequent recourse to God interiorly to implore His divine assistance,
   humbly confessing our impotence and misery. In this way we shall take
   part in the designs of God who seems occasionally to leave us to our
   own devices, to make us understand how little we can do when left to
   ourselves. What a great favour! and what an important virtue we shall
   have acquired in learning by repeated personal experiences the depths
   of our weakness, misery and poverty, and the continual need we have of
   the sustaining power of God to raise, enlighten and animate us by the
   interior influence of His grace.

   The deep impression that God has given you of a keen desire to divest
   yourself of your own will to follow His is a most precious grace; to
   guard and increase it you must, with all your heart and soul, make
   every effort, as often and for as long a time as you can, especially at
   prayer. I could wish that you were able to spend your whole life in
   this exercise alone, in great interior silence allowing the Holy Spirit
   to work in you by His grace; but all without violence or effort;
   gently, tranquilly, peacefully, because God only dwells in peaceful
   souls in which He takes His delight.

  Letter XIX.--To Aim at Simplicity.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen. To aim at Simplicity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Only a few days ago I answered at some length your last letter but one.
   If you find that, through me, God does not do much for you, you ought
   to conclude that my help is not necessary for you, or else that He will
   Himself provide for your necessities. How well He can do without us
   when He chooses! One single word uttered by Him to the ear of the soul
   is more instructive than all the discourses of men. The least little
   breath of grace wafts our ship more speedily on its course, and makes
   it arrive more surely and speedily into harbour than all our oars,
   sails, and sculls. I am delighted to hear that you are beginning to
   learn this, or rather that you daily have fresh and more touching
   proofs of it. Keep in this state: the interior silence of respect and
   submission alone, kept humbly in the presence of God if He does not
   command us to act, will sanctify our energies, soften our anxieties,
   and pacify our troubles, and that in one moment. Remain in this state
   of unity and simplicity; multiplicity throws the mind into trouble and
   confusion, scatters and disorders our powers without our being able to
   perceive it. Many desires trouble the soul, says the Holy Spirit. Here
   is a practice which I advise you to follow in order to reduce all your
   desires to a single one; take this truth well to heart. "I have been
   created and put into this world to serve God, to love Him, and to
   please Him; that is my task here; what does He wish to do with me in
   this world and the next? to what degree of glory will He raise me? That
   is for Him to determine; it is His business, it is, so to say, His
   task; each to his own business, the doing of that is the only thing to
   think of. Please God I will think of mine as willingly as God thinks of
   His." I remain in Him and through Him--my dear Sister. Yours, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XX.--Holy Simplicity.

   To Sister Anne-Marguerite Boudet de la Bellière. On the same subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   The way in which you take your little trials is infinitely pleasing to
   God, and I do not fear to give you this assurance, because in so
   generously renouncing, as you do, all interior sweetness and
   consolation for the love of Him, you merit to receive them more
   abundantly when the time arrives. The little, you tell me, that you
   have remembered of what I have told you, is the essential part, and
   that ought to suffice. God sees the heart, and that is all that He
   wants. Perfection does not consist in a multiplicity of acts even
   though interior; on the contrary the more we advance the more is God
   pleased to make it out of our power to produce many acts, but invites
   us to remain in His presence in a state of silence and humble
   recollection. Follow this attraction of grace. Be content to renew from
   time to time a simple act of faith and of charity, accompanied by total
   resignation and filial confidence. In all the different changes both
   interior and exterior, say always from the depths of your heart, "My
   God, I wish what you wish, I refuse nothing from Your fatherly hand, I
   accept all, and submit to all." In this simple act, continued, or
   rather habitual, consists our whole perfection. Also in this the heart
   and soul are kept in peace at their centre even when agitated on the
   surface by different trials and emotions that war against it. The
   better you understand how to maintain this holy interior simplicity the
   greater will be your progress, or to speak more correctly, the more God
   will help you to advance.

   Do not, however, expect to be able to measure the progress you make;
   that is impossible for this reason, that your progress depends more on
   the work of God in your soul than on your own acts, and that this work
   being purely spiritual, on that account is hardly perceptible.

   However, I give you some signs by which you may recognise in future the
   results of the divine action in your change of heart.

   1st. A holy indifference which resembles a sort of insensibility to all
   things of this world.

   2nd. A fund of peace from which it follows that you will not trouble
   yourself about anything, even about your faults and imperfections, and
   far less about those of your neighbour.

   3rd. A certain attraction towards God and the things of God; a sort of
   hunger and thirst after justice, that is to say, after virtue, piety,
   and all perfection. This hunger, which is very keen, is, nevertheless,
   exempt from eagerness and trouble, and leads you to will always what
   God wills, and nothing more; to bless Him in spiritual poverty as much
   as in abundance.

   Remember always this great saying of Jesus Christ: "If you do not
   become like little children you shall not enter into the Kingdom of
   Heaven." Be on your guard never to infringe, in the slightest degree,
   this holy simplicity, so little known, so little esteemed, yet so
   precious in the sight of God. Be always more and more upright and
   simple in your thoughts, words, opinions, actions, and behaviour. There
   are people who want to be just the contrary, and who pretend to be, out
   of vanity. How very far are these people from the Kingdom of God, since
   they have not even the foundation of it, which is humility. Whenever
   you go to pray, or leave it with a quiet, recollected, and
   well-disposed mind, you will always derive some fruit from it one way
   or another, and all the more when you believe that God is farthest from
   you, for then He will be nearest. Do not make a number of acts during
   prayer, but make a few very quietly, with the greatest repose of mind
   and heart, and in the greatest tranquillity possible. During the day do
   not force yourself to make so many different acts, and still less to
   feel fervour and devotion in making them; keep yourself firmly, humbly,
   and patiently in peace, tranquil and quite resigned in this emptiness
   of the mind and of the will. It is this emptiness of the spirit which
   conduces to pure love, and union with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXI.--Different Attractions of Grace.

   To Mother Thérèse Françoise de Rosen. On the different attractions of
   grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   The tendencies, on the subject of which you consult me, are not rare
   among souls who, like you, have been called by God to unite themselves
   with Him by a loving abandonment. Sometimes, you say, you feel yourself
   drawn to adore the divine Majesty with humility mixed with love, and by
   very distinct acts which arise of their own accord apparently, and are
   very delightful, filling the soul with a great contentment. At other
   times you are inclined to remain in complete repose with a clear
   apprehension of the presence of God, and without the power of forming
   distinct acts, unless with violent efforts, even during holy Mass, and
   then you feel obliged to take a book, and to do violence to yourself to
   escape from this apparent inaction which occasions your uneasiness:
   this is as near as possible to the two states, the principal traits of
   which you have depicted in your letter, and on the subject of which you
   desire my counsel. This is what I think about it. In the first place it
   is certain that each of these two states is a gift of God, but the
   second seems to be the best; first because it is more simple, more
   profound, more spiritual, and further removed from the senses,
   consequently more worthy of God Who is a pure spirit, and Whom we must
   worship in spirit and in truth; secondly, because it is an exercise of
   pure faith, which is less satisfying to the soul, less reassuring, and
   consequently, in which there is more of sacrifice and of perfect
   abandonment to God. Thirdly, because in this state it is the Holy
   Spirit that acts with the approval and consent of the soul, while in
   the first state, it is the soul that acts with the grace of God and
   this is more like ordinary effective prayer. Well! you must understand
   that those operations in which God has the greatest share, and the
   creature the least must be the most perfect. From this it follows that
   in this second state there is no serious danger of wasting time nor
   consequently any reason to fear that you do not fulfil the precept to
   hear Mass. You may adhere to this decision without the slightest
   scruple. And if, further, you wish to have my advice as to how to
   behave with regard to these two states when you experience them, I will
   give it to you. First, whenever the second attraction is strongly
   experienced, and absorbs you, in some measure, in spite of yourself,
   you ought to allow yourself to be gently drawn on, otherwise you would
   be resisting the inspiration and secret operations of the Holy Spirit
   within you, and thus would be acting according to your own ideas, out
   of self-love and in order to become satisfied and reassured. Now you
   must seek, in all things, not your own satisfaction however spiritual
   it may be, but the perfect satisfaction of God.

   If this attraction should not be very strong nor very urgent, you
   ought, nevertheless, to second it by keeping yourself in a profound
   silence to give more opportunity for the inmost operations of the Holy
   Spirit. This, at any rate, is the advice I give you for long hours of
   prayer; because, when you have only a short time for prayer, as in
   short visits to the Blessed Sacrament morning and evening, it would be
   more useful to cultivate the first attraction you mentioned. You could
   then make formal acts of adoration and love of God. But I will remind
   you of the counsel St. Francis of Sales gave to a person who followed
   the same method: I should wish these particular acts to be made without
   much feeling or effort, so that they may flow and be distilled from the
   highest point of the mind, as the same saint expresses it; because it
   is a received opinion that the more simple and above the senses these
   operations are, so much the more profoundly spiritual, and,
   consequently, perfect do they become. To pray according to your first
   method is to pray by formal, successive and perceptible acts; to pray
   according to the second method is to pray by implicit acts,
   experienced, but in no way expressed nor perceptible except confusedly.
   Or, in other words it is to pray by a simple but actual inclination of
   the heart; now this simple and real inclination of the heart contains
   all, and says all to God without, however, express words. The different
   names that are given to this method of prayer will make you understand
   it perfectly; it is called a loving waiting on God, a simple looking,
   or pure faith and simplicity tending to God; the prayer of surrender
   and abandonment to God, arising from the love of God, and producing an
   ever increasing love of God. By these examples you will see that this
   method is of more value than the other; you must, therefore, make it
   your principal exercise, without, however, neglecting the first at
   certain times as I told you above. Yours in our Lord.

  Letter XXII.--Fidelity to the Call of God.

   To a Postulant. On abandonment in the trials to which vocation is
   subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   All that you have told me, and written to me, makes me convinced that
   God calls you to religion, and, in particular to the Order of the
   Visitation. Your interior attraction to this Order, and the reasons you
   allege for it do not leave a doubt of this double vocation; for, as
   there is one for religion in general, there is also one for this or
   that community in particular. It only remains for you to be faithful to
   the call of God and thus to make sure your predestination.

   Now, this fidelity requires three things of you; first you must
   endeavour to preserve in your heart in spite of every obstacle both
   exterior and interior, this attraction towards God with the sincere
   desire to follow it when He Who has given it to you will Himself
   provide the means by which you will be able to concentrate yourself to
   His service in reality, as you have already done beforehand in your
   mind and heart. Your second duty is to hope against hope as Abraham
   did; that is, to believe firmly that, as God is all-powerful and that
   nothing in the world can resist Him, He will know how to overcome all
   the obstacles and oppositions of men in His own time. All minds and
   hearts are in His hands and He can turn them as He will without effort.
   It was by His simple "Fiat" that He created all things out of nothing.
   Therefore, when the time arrives, He has but to say "Fiat" and all the
   obstacles to your vocation will be removed. At present He allows these
   obstacles to try your patience, your faith in Him, and your firm
   reliance on His powerful succour. Therefore, do not be alarmed, but
   continue to trust firmly in God. Do not trouble yourself nor torment
   yourself at all, but submit to God generously; accept all the trials He
   sends you, saying to Him without ceasing, "Lord may all that You will
   be accomplished in me, at the time, and in the way that pleases you; I
   accept all and sacrifice my own interests, my wishes, and all the
   desires of my heart to have none other than to obey and please You in
   all things." Your third duty is a great fidelity to all your exercises
   of piety; prayers, readings, meditations, masses, confessions,
   Communions, examens, and interior recollection; frequent raising of the
   heart to God without ever giving up in the slightest degree any of
   these practices, either through grief, trouble, disgust, weariness,
   dryness, or for any other reason whatever. These trials are necessary
   to detach you from everything and to keep you united to God Who alone
   should be your light, your support, your consolation and your strength.

   Apparently it is to make you practise this abandonment better that God
   has permitted you to be forbidden to enter the Visitation, so that,
   receiving no consolation except from Him directly, you should attach
   yourself purely and solely to Him and thus gain great merit.

   You must, therefore, obey His orders in obeying those who have the
   right from Him to command you. If the command should prejudice the
   welfare of your soul God will not allow it to persist. He can easily
   put aside the obstacle when it is necessary, therefore rest quietly and
   without the slightest anxiety in the arms of His merciful providence as
   a little child rests on the breast of its mother.

  Letter XXIII.--The Value of Good Desires.

   To the same person. On the value of good desires.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The increase of the desire to consecrate yourself to God is an
   additional grace of His mercy. To suffer all the pain of being unable
   to accomplish these ardent desires is, insomuch as you bear it with
   resignation, to correspond well with this grace, and to merit its
   continuance. The interior effort to maintain yourself in this state of
   resignation is a sort of martyrdom that will, sooner or later, be
   rewarded. God will carry out the pious design with which He has
   inspired you, the delay is intend to try your fidelity. If, in the
   meantime, you are getting on in years, you need not consider that,
   because you already possess the best part of what you wish for, which
   is, the strong desire to consecrate yourself to God. This desire is, in
   the sight of God, the best part of the sacrifice, or, to speak
   correctly, it is the entire sacrifice since you have already given
   yourself to Him, in heart and soul, and are now sacrificing your most
   earnest desires in awaiting patiently the time chosen by His
   providence. Possibly this last sacrifice is of more value than the
   first, since by it you renounce more entirely your own will. Therefore
   be at peace and quite tranquil in the presence of Him who sees to the
   bottom of our hearts and who takes all your good desires for
   performance. He has no need of anything that you could give Him; but He
   loves a heart that is ready and willing to sacrifice all. The fear of
   death and of the judgments of God is a good thing as long as it does
   not go so far as to cause you trouble and anxiety; then it would be an
   illusion of the devil. For, what is it that makes you afraid? Is it
   because you have not yet done what you have not been able to do? Does
   God require what is impossible? Is it, as you add, because you have, as
   yet, done nothing for heaven? Be careful again in this; it is a
   delicate subject for it seems as if you wanted to acquire merit for
   your own assurance.This is not real confidence which can only be
   founded on the mercy of God, and the infinite merits of Jesus Christ.
   Any other confidence would be vain and presumptuous, since it would
   rest on your own nothingness, and I know not what wretched works which
   have no value in the sight of God. Without depending in any way on
   ourselves let us try and accomplish, with the help of God's grace, all
   that He demands of us, and hope only in His goodness and in the merits
   of Jesus Christ, His Son.

   You are right in saying that more grace is required to save us in the
   world than in religion. From this I form the opinion that, evidently, a
   much more distinct vocation is necessary for those who have to remain
   in the world, than for the religious state; but, at the same time there
   are particular graces given to those who, against their will, have to
   remain in the world. God is then, as it were, obliged to take care of
   them. Therefore fear nothing, you are already a Religious in heart and
   soul. Try to subject your mind, feelings, and actions to the spirit of
   the rules of this holy state, by a humble resignation and a perfect
   confidence in the fatherly goodness and power of that heavenly Spouse
   whom you have chosen. He, also, regards you as His beloved Spouse.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXIV.--The Call of God a Sign of Predestination.

   To the same person.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are quite right to consider the design with which God has inspired
   you as one of the greatest graces. It is the surest sign of the
   predestination of a soul by God when He calls it to His divine service.
   On this, not only its eternal salvation depends, but even temporal
   happiness, since experience proves that peace and true contentment in
   this world can only be found in the service of God. Besides, the
   depravity of the times is so great, that it is very difficult to serve
   God perfectly out of religion. It costs so much to serve God in the
   world, that people often lose courage and give up their good
   intentions. You must, therefore, thank our Lord without ceasing for the
   gratuitous grace He has given you, in preference to so many others who
   are lost in the world while leading in it a life full of sorrow and
   disappointment. In the second place you must trust in the goodness of
   God, and firmly hope that the design with which He has inspired you, He
   will bring to a successful conclusion. It is often for our greater
   advantage that He defers the accomplishment of our most holy desires.
   His providence can by hidden, but infallible means, cause things to
   succeed in spite of every obstacle, even when success seems absolutely
   impossible. God often allows His work to be thwarted in order to make
   the exercise of His power more striking, and to show us that He is
   absolute master of all, and that, as without Him we can do nothing, so
   with His assistance we shall be able to accomplish what appears
   impossible in our eyes. In the third place you must resign yourself
   entirely to whatever is the will of God, telling Him frequently that
   you wish to depend on Him for everything, and that you will have no
   other will but His. In this way when anything happens to cross your,
   apparently, most just desires you must, before all, make the sacrifice
   of them, and then remain in peace, for nothing is so opposed to the
   Spirit of God and to the marks of His grace, than interior distress,
   produced by a too great eagerness for even the best and holiest things.
   Moderate this indiscreet zeal, this too impetuous impulsiveness, and
   direct all your efforts to the fulfilment of the holy will of God in
   all things, renouncing your own will however holy and reasonable it may
   appear to you. There is, truly, no solid virtue nor true sanctity apart
   from an entire resignation to, and acquiescence in the will of God. If
   you feel an occasional repugnance to submit yourself to what God
   ordains, you should go to Him at once interiorly by prayer, and implore
   Him to subject your will to His in all things, and to give you strength
   to overcome your repugnance and your self-love which desires its own
   satisfaction in even the holiest things. Nevertheless, as it is God's
   rule that we should do all in our power to cause the good desires with
   which He has inspired us to succeed, this is what you ought to do.

   1st. Frequent the Sacraments as often and as well as you can.

   2nd. Live in a great purity of conscience by avoiding the slightest
   fault that might keep God at a distance from you.

   3rd. Every day, at your convenience, spend some time in spiritual
   reading which will take the place of meditation when you are unable to
   make it.

   4th. During the course of the day raise your mind and heart to God as
   often as possible, especially when you experience pain, weariness,
   disappointment, or any repugnance. Offer them to Him as a continual
   sacrifice. In this way you will obtain constant fresh graces and
   heavenly inspirations, to which it is of infinite importance that you
   should be faithful, because it is particularly to this fidelity that
   God usually imparts His greatest gifts, and above all, that of
   perseverance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXV.--God Only Desires What We are Able to Give.

   To the same person.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The sort of martyrdom you are suffering will, if you endure it with
   patience and perfect resignation, be very pleasing to God, for all
   perfection consists in conforming your will entirely to the will of God
   in all things; that is to say, that you must never will anything else
   but what God wills. Now, it is of faith that God wills everything that
   happens to us, except sin, because with the exception of sin nothing
   happens in this world but by the hidden dispensations of Providence.
   This taken for granted, I cannot understand why you should suffer so
   much at the postponement of your sacrifice, since it is God who puts
   obstacles to it, and thus shows you that He only requires of you the
   desire to make it until such time as He, Himself, gives you the means
   and power to do so. But beware lest, since we always try to gratify our
   own will in all things, this inability should wound your self-love,
   make you lose interior peace, and cause all sorts of troubles. It is a
   sure sign that we are seeking rather to indulge our own self-love than
   to please God when we prefer our own will to His. For if we only
   desired to do His holy will we should always be content and tranquil
   with this thought, God only requires of me what I am able to give Him,
   and that is, the desire to consummate my sacrifice; and, according to
   His will this desire should be quiet, peaceful, and submissive to all
   the designs of His divine providence: but suppose I should never be
   able to accomplish my holy desires? Very well! that would prove to me
   that God does not require it, and I should be satisfied to do His holy
   will; because it would then be obvious that God did not wish for the
   sacrifice itself, but only that I should be willing to make it.

   It was thus that God acted with regard to Abraham, whose generous
   readiness to sacrifice his son Isaac He rewarded as though the
   sacrifice had been consummated. It has been the same with many of the
   saints who had a very strong desire for martyrdom without being able to
   carry it out. God, not permitting nor desiring the actual sacrifice, is
   satisfied with the sacrifice of desire, which, in His sight, is the
   same thing.

   But, suppose that in consequence of this I am obliged to live in the
   world, what will become of me? These are vain fears put into your mind
   by the devil to make you lose the peace of your soul. You must abandon
   yourself entirely to God, and put your whole trust in Him. He is
   powerful enough to make you stand firm in the world, and good enough to
   sustain you when it is by the arrangements of His providence that you
   live in it.

   You could not do better, therefore, than to practise recollection and
   abnegation in renouncing your own will in everything, but particularly
   in your too eager desires, however holy they may be; for this excessive
   vehemence, and these restless struggles show much imperfection and
   self-love. These defects are still more clearly shown in the vexation
   and distress to which you give way after falling into certain faults;
   for these feelings are never produced by the love of God, which, on the
   contrary, conduces to peace; but by a discontented self-love, and a
   secret pride stung by the sight of your own imperfections. A soul that
   is truly humble, instead of entertaining these useless and dangerous
   feelings, will, after a fall, humble itself gently and tranquilly
   before God without any uneasiness on account of it. It will feel sorry
   without anxiety and beg forgiveness without disturbance, and even thank
   Him for preventing it falling into greater sins.

  Letter XXVI.--Abandonment as to Employments and Undertakings.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   If you could but understand, once for all, that everything that God
   wills must succeed, because He knows how to make even difficulties and
   the opposition of men conduce to the fulfilment of His designs. Believe
   me, if it be for your greater advantage, in vain will men try to
   prevent its success; but if, on the contrary, it will not be
   advantageous to you, what better can God do than to prevent it? Now God
   alone can look into the future and see all its consequences; as for us,
   we are poor blind creatures, who have to fear all sorts of danger even
   in the events that appear to have the best promise of success. What
   better could we do than to place the whole matter in God's care? Could
   our future be more secure than in the all-powerful hands of that
   adorable Master, of that good and loving Father? who loves us more than
   we love ourselves? Where could we find a safer refuge than in the arms
   of divine Providence? This is the blissful centre in which our hearts
   should find their repose. Withdrawn from this there is no solid peace,
   nor comfort, nothing but discomfort, anxiety, and bitterness of heart,
   miseries in the present life, and danger to eternal salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXVII.--Acceptance of Duties.

   To Mother Marie-Anne-Sophie de Rottembourg (1738). On abandonment in
   the acceptance of duties.
     __________________________________________________________________

   May the peace of Jesus Christ reign always in your heart, and may the
   most holy will of God be ever accomplished in, and by you. I already
   knew of your election, Rev. Mother, and rejoiced at it at once in God,
   because I did not doubt that it would be pleasing to all the community
   and for their spiritual profit.

   As long as you retain your present dispositions your office, however
   calculated it may seem to relax your spirit, will not be at all
   injurious to you, for I remember to have read that our duties and
   employments do not hurt us so much as the eagerness, anxiety and
   trouble that arise from the activity of our nature, and the desire to
   succeed in everything before the world.

   The celebrated M. de Renti said that it made no difference to him, nor
   did he experience any difficulty in keeping recollected whether he was
   at prayer in his oratory, or working, or in any other occupation done
   for the love of God, or the good of his neighbour. We should be able to
   say the same, if we were as detached as he and as free from all
   self-seeking.

   You do not do well, therefore, in so strenuously opposing the office
   that Providence had allotted to you. God forgive you, but do not go on
   with it. To desire nothing, and to refuse nothing, was the maxim of St.
   Francis of Sales. I advise you to make it yours. Any fresh proof that
   you are likely to receive of the visible succour of heaven, will render
   you without excuse if you do not ground yourself in an unreserved
   abandonment, and an unlimited confidence. Sister N. has committed the
   same kind of fault, but she is less excusable, as she would not yield
   to the entreaties that were made to her. Please tell her how little
   edified I was at her conduct. The hope of being better able to preserve
   recollection has made her lose the occasion for practising a host of
   virtues. If she had had the simplicity to submit, she would have
   practised at the same time the virtues of obedience, charity and zeal.
   I do not speak of abnegation which she would also have practised so
   excellently in overcoming her antipathy, and in giving her services so
   generously to the community in the duty that was offered her. Even the
   want of capacity that she believed she recognised in herself should
   have been a greater incentive to its acceptance, for the harm which
   might have resulted to the community through her incapacity, was no
   business of hers, as she did not try in any way to obtain this office,
   and therefore it could have had no other result for her than merit. To
   how many little acts of humility, patience, and endurance of
   inconveniences, and constraint; how much vigilance, and charity would
   not this incapacity have given occasion for? But she had not the
   courage to face these sacrifices, and has given in to her self-love
   while she imagined she was following the dictates of humility. At least
   let her humble herself profoundly before God, let her learn to become
   very little in her own eyes, and omit nothing that could repair the
   disedification she has given her Sisters.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXVIII.--To Will Only What God Wills.

   Everything that tends to lessen the strength of our passions or to hold
   them in check is a singular grace of God. Give yourself up, therefore,
   to the attraction which this holy repose has for you, and allow no free
   entrance either in your mind or heart to anything like desire, fear,
   hope, sadness, joy, or voluntary despondency, so that, in this way, the
   peace of God will dwell within you, and the less sensible it is the
   more is it to be prized as it can come only from God. When one does not
   interfere in anything that does not concern one, a delightful solitude
   can be found everywhere; however, those difficulties and importunities
   with which divine Providence allows us to be afflicted are preferable
   to this solitude. It is true that the former condition is pleasanter,
   and more consoling, but the latter being more painful, is also more
   meritorious when it is arranged by God without our own choice. From
   this I conclude that there are many ways that lead to God but that each
   person should follow her own without envying that of her neighbour. Not
   to will to be otherwise than God wills--in this is contained all
   present happiness with the hope of eternal joy. Let us always distrust
   our eagerness, especially for good works; let us put up patiently with
   what God puts up with, and after having done all that, in reason, we
   could do, or thought we ought to do according to the light God gave us,
   let us remain quiet and peaceful, abandoning ourselves in all things to
   His adorable will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXIX.--To Leave All to God.

   To the same person. Only God knows what is expedient for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   You say you wish to know the time of my return. To tell you the truth I
   do not know myself, and do not wish to know; I give and abandon myself
   entirely to divine Providence in everything, and for everything from
   day to day. Do the same as far as you can, nothing could be better.

   Oh! my dear Sister, how much I desire you to taste the sweetness of
   this hidden manna, which to the true Israelite has the flavour of the
   most delicious food. Let us desire only God, and God will satisfy all
   our desires. Let us blindly abandon ourselves to His holy will in all
   things, and by doing so we shall be delivered from all our cares. We
   shall then find, that, to advance in the ways of salvation and
   perfection there is, after all, very little to do, and that it suffices
   without so much examination about the past, and reflexion as to the
   future, to place our confidence in God at the present moment, and to
   regard Him as our good Father who is leading us by the hand.

   God forbid, then, that I should make any attempt whatever to throw
   light on the complete ignorance in which to I am as my destination. I
   much prefer to remain in this ignorance, abandoned to God, with no
   cares nor anxieties, like a little child reposing on the breast of a
   good and loving mother; willing only what God wills, and desiring
   nothing contrary to His wishes. In this happy state of abandonment I
   find peace and a complete rest for the heart and mind, and this
   protects me from a thousand useless thoughts and from all uneasy
   desires and anxieties about the future. God has made me pass through
   many places, conditions and duties, and in all of them were mingled so
   much that was good and also so many hardships that, had I to pass
   through them again, I should not be able of myself to make a choice.
   Only God knows what is expedient for us, He loves us more than we love
   ourselves; what better can we do then, than to leave all to His will to
   choose for us? If we could but realise that the only great and
   important affair in this world is that of our eternal salvation.
   Provided we succeed in this, all will be well, and we need trouble
   about nothing else. Besides, if I sought my own pleasure I do not see
   where I could find any better than to be like a bird on a branch,
   without any certainty about my stay. This uncertainty leads to a more
   complete abandonment, and this again forms my peace. It delivers me
   from the care of guiding myself and gives me the assurance of arriving
   safely at my journey's end supported by God, and following the steps of
   His divine Providence. From whom else could I receive such a consoling
   assurance? There is no one capable of giving it to me however perfect
   his friendship.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXX.--Resignation in Sickness.

   To the same person. On abandonment in sickness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Your incurable complaints would affect me with a very great compassion
   did I not know that they form a great treasure for you in eternity. It
   is a sort of martyrdom, a kind of purgatory, and an inexhaustible
   source of every species of sacrifice, and of acts of continued
   resignation. I assure you that all this, borne as you are doing it,
   without complaint, or murmuring, is very likely to sanctify you. Even
   if you only practised the patience of ordinary good Christians you
   would gain a great deal of merit; but, from what you say I gather that
   you are doing more than this, and the involuntary rebellion of nature
   and occasional little signs of impatience which escape you in spite of
   yourself will not impede your union with God which remains in the
   centre of your heart. Your life may well be called a hard and laborious
   one, a life of pain and trial, it will, therefore be your purgatory in
   this world and deliver you from that of the next or at any rate shorten
   it considerably. This is why I do not dare to ask God to deliver you
   from a trouble that must soon end, and for which you will have to thank
   Him for all eternity as a special sign of His mercy. The only request I
   could make Him for you is an increase of His love, and the virtues of
   submission, patience, and resignation which will greatly add to the
   merit of your sufferings. To feel no fear at the thought of death is a
   grace from God. As for your sufferings and the outward annoyances you
   have to endure, bear them as you do your physical ills. God does not
   require more; just a daily "fiat" applied to all your exterior
   sufferings ought to work your salvation as well as your perfection. All
   that books or directors can say may be reduced to this one word, "Fiat,
   fiat," at all times and for everything, but especially in the
   penitential and crucified life to which it has pleased Providence to
   reduce you. Tobias in his blindness, Job on his dung-hill, and so many
   other saints prostrate on beds of suffering did no more than this. It
   is true that they did it more perfectly, and with greater love. Let us
   try to imitate their virtues as we share their trials, and one day we
   shall assuredly share their glory.

  Letter XXXI.--Conduct in Sickness.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet (1735).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Although your illness is not serious I am sure you act like those
   generous souls, who, in their least discomforts go on till the worst
   comes to the worst, in order to have occasion to make greater
   sacrifices for God. But, it is usually said, in order to offer the
   sacrifice of one's life to God ought one not to feel better prepared
   for death! and I am so unprepared! To these fears I urge you to reply
   in the following manner. Whether ready and prepared to die or not, I am
   always ready, always disposed to do the will of God. Your blessed
   Father St. Francis of Sales said a very remarkable and consoling thing
   on this subject that would suit all sorts of people: "I believe," said
   he, "that God would not condemn the greatest sinner on earth, however
   great his crimes, who at his last moments made a generous offering of
   his life, abandoning himself entirely to His divine will and loving
   Providence." And I truly believe it, since such an act is one of
   perfect love capable of blotting out all sin even without confession,
   like baptism and martyrdom. Often let us make these acts of love, then,
   by placing in the hands of God all that He has lent us, because He
   could not give us anything absolutely. And since, according to the
   words of Jesus Christ we must become little children again, let us
   imitate those little ones whose father, to try their dispositions makes
   them return some of the playthings and sweets he has given them. They
   would be very silly and very selfish if they did not at once say, "Dear
   father, take what you like, you can have them all." After all, what do
   these poor children give, and to whom does it really belong? All the
   same the father's heart is touched by these little signs of a good
   disposition. "Oh you good children, you dear children!" and he kisses
   them and is always more generous towards them in future. This is how
   our good God will act towards us, whenever He gives us occasion to
   offer Him some sacrifice.

  Letter XXXII.--Patience with the Faults of Others.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On bearing with your neighbour and
   yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   It is a great grace to see others behaving badly without feeling
   bitterness, indignation, impatience, or even disturbance. If, for good
   reasons, you speak about it, watch over your heart and your tongue, so
   that nothing may escape you that would not be approved by God: and have
   good motives for whatever you say. Humble yourself quietly and lament
   in peace those faults that may have crept in during such talks. Often
   ask God to give you great charity and circumspection, and then remain
   tranquil. Keep yourself in the holy desire to belong entirely to God;
   pray with faith, confidence and resignation, and above all humble
   yourself profoundly before His divine Majesty. It is for Him to finish
   the work He has begun in you; no one else would be able to succeed in
   it, but know that there are many sacrifices to be made before God can
   take possession of our hearts by the ineffable delights of His pure
   love. Let us sigh for this happiness, and let us never weary of begging
   for it; let us purchase it by generous sacrifices, we shall never be
   able to pay too much for it. As our hearts cannot exist without love,
   shall we not go to the Heart of our God to derive from it the
   sustenance that alone can appease our hunger? May this divine love come
   then, and take possession of our hearts, may it sustain them, set them
   on fire and transform them into itself. Let us abandon ourselves
   without reserve to God and not interfere with His loving providence but
   think only of keeping straight in the road that God has marked out for
   us from all eternity, and in which we find ourselves at the present
   moment. One can dispute unendingly about predestination, and such
   arguments can only serve to make salvation seem more difficult; what
   is, however, undeniable is that there is no better expedient to ensure
   predestination than the actual and continual accomplishment of the will
   of God.

  Letter XXXIII.--Patience with Oneself.

   To the same person. On bearing with herself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   We must submit to God in all things and about all things; as to the
   state and condition in which He has placed us, the good or evil
   circumstances that He has allotted us, and even as to the character,
   mind, nature, temperament, and inclinations with which He has endowed
   us. Practise yourself, therefore, in being patient with regard to
   yourself and in this perfect submission to the divine will. When you
   have acquired this you will enjoy great peace, and not distress
   yourself about anything, nor get out of humour with yourself, but put
   up with yourself with the same gentleness which you should use towards
   your neighbour. This is a more important matter than you would imagine,
   and just at present is most essential to your sanctification. Keep it,
   therefore, always before your eyes, and make frequent acts of
   submission to the holy will of God, of charity, of endurance, and of
   gentleness towards yourself even more than towards your neighbour. You
   will never attain to this without great efforts.

   A soul to whom God makes known its defects is much more burdensome to
   itself than its neighbour ever could be to it, because the latter,
   however near to us, is not always with us; at any rate is not within
   us, whereas we carry ourselves about with us, and cannot leave
   ourselves for a single moment, nor completely cease to behold
   ourselves, to feel ourselves, and to carry about with us everywhere our
   imperfections, and our faults. But see wherein the infinite goodness of
   our God shines forth; for the sorrow and shame that our faults cause us
   are their own remedy, provided that this shame never turns into
   defiance, and that the sorrow is inspired by the love of God, and not
   by self-love. Sorrow born of self-love is full of vexation and
   bitterness; far from healing the wounds of our soul, it only serves to
   poison them. On the other hand, sorrow produced by the love of God is
   calm and full of resignation; while detecting the fault it delights in
   the humiliation which follows, and from this it results that much merit
   is gained, and thus even from losses we make profit. Cease then from
   tormenting yourself on account of your defects and of the imperfection
   of your works. Offer to God the sorrow they occasion you, and allow His
   divine Providence to make good these slight infidelities by many little
   crosses and sufferings of all kinds. Arm yourself only with patience,
   raise yourself again as soon as possible and deplore your falls with a
   sweet, tranquil humility. God wishes you to act thus, and by this
   indefatigable patience you will render Him more glory and will make
   more progress than the most violent efforts would have enabled you to
   do.

  Letter XXXIV.--Preparation for the Sacraments.

   To the same person. On preparation for the Sacraments, prayer, reading
   and conduct.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Believe me, my dear Sister, that peace of mind, confidence, and
   abandonment to God, with the desire of being united to Jesus Christ are
   the best preparation for the Sacraments. But the devil tries to deceive
   people, and leaves nothing undone to disturb the interior peace of the
   soul, for he well knows that once this divine peace is firmly
   established in the heart, all will be easy to us, and we shall fly, as
   it were, in the ways of perfection. Do not let us be deluded, then, by
   any pretexts of which he may make use, however specious they may be,
   and let us go to God humbly with the simplicity and confidence that St.
   Francis of Sales advises, in the uprightness of a heart that sincerely
   seeks Him. As to prayer you well know what I have so much recommended
   to you; do not allow yourself to be discouraged nor vexed at your
   distractions. Manage, however, that your interior turning to God and
   the raising of your heart to Him during the day may become so frequent
   that that alone, in case of need will take the place of prayer,
   without, however, leaving off making it as well as you can. Apply
   yourself especially to reading the letters of St. Francis of Sales, you
   will find them so well suited to your present state and condition that
   you could read them as though the saint had written them to yourself
   from heaven, and as though the Holy Spirit had dictated them to him for
   you.

   You wish to know what it is that I ask of God for you in particular. It
   is this, and for such easy things that their very facility will charm
   you.

   1st. The moderation of your exterior conduct, which will be a wonderful
   help to you in gradually overcoming your passions; in other words, to
   speak gently, to act quietly, without any vehemence or impetuosity just
   as though you were of a phlegmatic temperament.

   2nd. Interior gentleness towards yourself and others, at least of the
   kind that nothing contrary to this virtue may show in your exterior
   conduct; or that, if for a moment you should forget yourself you will
   not fail to make reparation and to rise without delay.

   3rd. An entire abandonment to divine Providence as to the success of
   everything, without excepting your own advancement in virtue; not
   wishing to be better than God wishes you to be, and saying always, "I
   wish only what God wills."

   4th. A peace of heart that nothing can disturb, not even your own
   faults and sins, and which will make you return to God with a peaceful
   and quiet humility, as though you had not had the misfortune to offend
   His divine Majesty or that you were assured of pardon. Follow this
   advice with simplicity, and you will see how God will help you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXXV.--Conduct in a Time of Rest.

   To a secular. On conduct during a time passed in the country.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is what you should do during the time you spend in the country. If
   you faithfully follow my counsels, they will sanctify this time of rest
   and make it bear fruit.

   1st. Approach the Sacraments as often as you are allowed to do so.

   2nd. Offer to God each morning the recreations of the day and with them
   the different pains both exterior and interior with which He is pleased
   in His goodness to season them, and say from time to time: "Blessed be
   God in all things and for all things; Lord may Your holy will be done."

   3rd. As you are less busy than others, employ more of your time in
   reading good books, and in order to make this more efficacious, set
   about it in this way. Begin by placing yourself in the presence of God,
   and by begging His help. Read quietly, slowly, word for word to enter
   into the subject more with the heart than the mind. At the end of each
   paragraph that contains a complete meaning, stop for the time it would
   take you to recite a "Pater" or even a little longer, to assimilate
   what you have read, or to rest and remain peacefully before God. Should
   this peace and rest last for a longer time it will be all the better;
   but when you find that your mind wanders resume your reading, and
   continue thus, frequently renewing these same pauses.

   4th. Nothing need prevent you continuing the same method, if you find
   it useful to your soul, during the time you have fixed for meditation.

   5th. In the course of the day, occupy yourself about things that are
   necessary, and that obedience requires of you, and which divine
   Providence has marked out for you.

   6th. Be careful to drop vain and useless thoughts directly you are
   conscious of them, but quietly, without effort or violence.

   7th. Above all drop all anxious thoughts, abandoning to divine
   Providence all that might become a subject of preoccupation for you.

   8th. In raising your heart to God, often say to Him, "Lord deliver me
   from so many reflexions which, however good in appearance, might keep
   me in my own way, and in a dangerous confidence in myself. Substitute
   Your divine Spirit for mine, transform and remodel all the powers of my
   soul by this holy Spirit and by His holy operations." At other times
   say, "When will it please you, oh my God, to teach me the great secret
   of understanding how to keep myself in interior peace and silence, to
   allow of Your effecting in my soul all the changes You know to be
   necessary? Lord, this I desire with all my heart, and ask it of You
   with the greatest earnestness through Jesus Christ Your Son, in order
   that You may be able to establish gradually within me the reign of Your
   ineffable peace, of Your grace and of Your divine love. And since for
   this You require the cooperation of Your poor unworthy creature, I will
   prepare myself with the help of Your grace, by being faithful to all
   the little practices that have been recommended to me; I hope that You
   will bless and second this blind submission, and I offer You beforehand
   all the pains of my mind, and rebellions of heart which You may permit
   in order to try me; I resign myself to them and from henceforth offer
   them to You in sacrifice."

  Letter XXXVI.--On Life and Death.

   To Sister M. Antoinette de Mahuet (1742). On life and death,
   consolations and trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here I am again at Albi, in a very agreeable climate, and among
   sociable people in whom the only fault I find is that of being too kind
   to me who always prefer solitude. The frequent invitations I receive
   are, to me, a veritable cross, and God will without doubt send me many
   others to temper the pleasure I feel in finding myself for the fourth
   time in a country that I have always loved so much. Blessed be God for
   all. He sows crosses everywhere! but I have already made a sacrifice of
   all, have accepted and offered in advance all the afflictions He is
   pleased to send me. This intention made beforehand renders trials much
   easier to bear when they come and makes them seem much lighter than
   imagination depicted them. Therefore I am overjoyed to find myself
   where God wishes me to be by the arrangements of His loving providence
   which always leads me as though by the hand. This paternal solicitude
   of which I am continually the object, redoubles my confidence. Although
   I am always in perfect health I feel that the years, so rapidly
   passing, will soon bring me to that eternal goal to which we are all
   hastening. True! this thought is bitter to nature but by dint of
   considering it as salutary it becomes almost agreeable as a disgusting
   remedy gradually ceases to appear so when its good effects have been
   experienced. One of my friends said the other day that in getting old
   it seemed to him that time passed with increasing rapidity, and that
   weeks seemed to him as short as days used to be, months like weeks, and
   years like months. As for that, what do a few years more or less
   signify to us who have to live and continue as long as God Himself?
   Those who have gone before us twenty or thirty years ago or even a
   century, or those who will follow us twenty or thirty years hence will
   neither be behindhand nor before others in that vast eternity, but it
   will seem to all of us as though we began it together. Oh! what power
   does not this thought contain to soften the rigours of our short and
   miserable life which, patiently endured, will be to our advantage. A
   longer or a shorter life, a little more, or a little less pain, what is
   it in comparison with the eternal life that awaits us? for which we are
   making rapidly, incessantly, and which is almost in sight, for me
   especially who am as it were on the brink, and on the point of
   embarking. It is therefore time, I ought to say with St. Francis of
   Sales and Fr. Surin to prepare my small equipment for eternity. Now the
   best equipment is that which appeared for us in the crosses which we
   bear lovingly, and the great sacrifices we make for God in doing His
   holy will. Nothing will console us more at the hour of death than our
   humble submission to the different arrangements of divine Providence in
   spite of the subtle imaginations of self-love often hidden under the
   most spiritual disguise and the most specious pretexts.

   Do not be surprised then, my dear Sister, at being placed by God in
   this necessity of practising abandonment. The vicissitudes of good and
   evil, of illness and cure through which He makes you pass are well
   calculated to keep you in a state of continual dependence upon Him and
   to impel you to make acts of confidence of the most meritorious kind.
   To make a holy use of sufferings mitigates them considerably, and
   renders them extremely profitable. To bear them well is to make a great
   sacrifice comparable to that of those generous Christians who formerly
   confessed their faith at the stake; because the sufferings of life and
   the sorrows attached to the different states make martyrs of
   Providence, as the tortures inflicted by tyrants made martyrs of faith
   and of religion. I find, too, that the comparison of which you make use
   is very just. Yes, our life is like the journey of the Israelites
   across the desert amidst a thousand trials and followed by the too just
   judgments of God. Let us imitate the faithful Jews in recognising the
   divine equity in the chastisements He inflicts on us, and in regarding
   all our afflictions both visible and hidden as the work of God and not
   that of man's injustice. God, says St. Augustine, would not allow any
   evil to happen, if He were not sufficiently powerful and good to turn
   it all to the greater good of His elect. Let us make use of our present
   evils, to escape those that are eternal, and to merit the rewards
   promised to faith and patience. The time will come, and it is at hand,
   when we shall say with David, "We have rejoiced for the days in which
   Thou hast humbled us for the years in which we have seen evils" (Ps.
   89, v. 15).

  Letter XXXVI.--Not to Desire Consolations.

   To the same person. Nancy, 21st February 1735. Desire for consolations
   a mistake.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I have seen the card announcing the death of dear Sister Anne-Catherine
   de Prudhomme (see note). I could in no way regret the departed whose
   fate is rather to be envied. At the sight of death fear should be
   united to confidence, but confidence ought to predominate.

   Abandonment is what the Sister you mention should aim at. I refer her
   on this subject to the letter of B. Paul, who says she is no longer
   uneasy, as formerly, about the graces necessary during life, and at the
   hour of death, because she will be encouraged by God whose name of
   "Father" gives her confidence with resignation. If it is not possible
   to feel this, even then one must abandon oneself to God, and this
   abandonment when not felt is of more value since it involves a greater
   sacrifice.

   This letter of B. Paul I use as spiritual reading. After having
   answered it, it seemed to me that I had understood better from it, and
   more enjoyed certain very interior things that were both delicate and
   profound. I do not at all approve of an anxious pursuit after
   consolations either in spiritual or physical wretchedness and misery.
   That comes of too much care of oneself. Would that there were souls
   strong and courageous enough to endure the apparent absences of the
   heavenly Spouse, who never absents Himself in reality, but only in
   appearance, to detach us from what is sensible even in the most
   spiritual things, because the gifts of God are not God Himself. He
   alone is all, and should be all in all to us. Excessive fear arises
   from a want of confidence and abandonment: it is on this account that I
   referred Sister . . . . to this letter of B. Paul. God wills that she,
   and you too, should remain in such absolute poverty that He has given
   me nothing for either of you; but I hope that you will both profit by a
   good long letter written to someone of whom I asked a copy. Will you
   return me the original as I want to send it to another person, who is
   precisely Sister . . . . of whom God made me think. I greet most
   heartily all the Sisters, and particularly Marie-Anne-Thérèse, and with
   especial respect your Rev. Mother, L. F. de Rosen.

   Note.--This Sister came of a very noble family of Lorraine, and was
   professed in the Convent of the Visitation, Sister Marie de Nancy, in
   the year 1666, at the age of 21. Her principal attraction was that of
   abandonment to divine Providence. She was perfectly submissive to the
   will of God by a continual "fiat" for every event, saying on all
   occasions, "If you, my divine King, my great Monarch, will, or do not
   will such, or such a thing, that suffices me. May You be praised and
   blessed for all and in all." Her great confidence in God drew down
   abundant graces upon her soul. In her last illness she remained always
   in a state of constant adoration, contrition, faith, confidence, and
   union with Jesus Christ crucified, of love of God, and abandonment to
   His fatherly goodness, and always wore a look of peace, joy, and
   thanksgiving. Her union with God continuing up to her last breath, she
   quietly expired of simple weakness at the age of 90, with all her
   intellectual faculties unimpaired. (This extract is from the life of
   this good Sister, by Rev. Mother L. F. de Rosen.)

  Letter I.--About Vanity and Infidelities.

   To Sister M. Thérèse de Vioménil. About feelings of vanity and frequent
   infidelities.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister and very dear daughter in our Lord. The peace of Jesus
   Christ be always with you. You must know that before curing you of
   vanity God wills to make you feel all the ugliness of this accursed
   passion, and to convince you thoroughly of your powerlessness to cure
   it, so that all the glory of your cure should revert to Him alone. You
   have, then, in this matter, only two things to do. Firstly to examine
   peacefully this frightful interior ugliness. Secondly, to hope for and
   await in peace from God alone the moment fixed for your cure. You will
   never be at rest till you have learnt to distinguish what is from God
   from that which is your own; to separate what belongs to Him from what
   belongs to yourself. You add, "How can you teach me this secret." You
   do not understand what you are saying. I can easily teach it to you in
   a moment, but you cannot learn to practise it until you have been made
   to feel, in peace, all your miseries. I say, in peace, to give room for
   the operations of grace.

   Remember the words of St. Francis of Sales: "One cannot put on
   perfection as one does a dress." The secret you ask for I give you
   freely; try to understand it so that it may gradually work its way into
   your soul, which is what you hope.

   All that is good in you comes from God, all that is bad, spoiled and
   corrupt comes from yourself. Therefore put on one side the nothingness,
   the sin, the evil inclinations, and habits, a whole heap of miseries,
   and weaknesses, as your share, and it belongs to you in truth. All that
   remains: the body with all its senses, the soul with its faculties, and
   the small amount of good performed, this is God's and belongs to Him so
   absolutely that you could not appropriate any part by the least act of
   complacency without committing a theft and robbery from God.

   That which you so often repeat interiorly, "Lord, You can do all
   things, have pity on me," is a good and a most simple act; nothing more
   is required to gain His all powerful aid: keep constant to these
   practices and interior dispositions; God will do the rest without your
   perceiving it.

   I am thoroughly convinced that, without great unfaithfulness on your
   part, God will work great things in you by His holy operation. Count
   upon this and do not place any voluntary obstacles in the way; and if,
   unfortunately, you recognise that you have done so, humble yourself
   promptly, return to God and to yourself always retaining an absolute
   confidence in the divine goodness.

   3rd. A lively sense of your misery, and the continual need you are in
   of God's help is a very great grace and opens the way to all good but
   especially to the prayer of humility and annihilation before God which
   is so pleasing to Him.

   4th. You do not understand as I do, the effects, and the operations of
   grace in your soul; if you recognised them you would be too satisfied
   with them, but your weakness and lack of virtue do not allow you to
   bear the knowledge. It is necessary that this fruit of grace should
   remain hidden and, as it were, buried in the abyss of your miseries and
   beneath a keen sense of your weakness. Under this heap of refuse God
   preserves the fruits of His grace, for such is the depth of our
   wretchedness that we compel God to hide from us His gifts as well as
   the rich ornaments with which He adorns our souls; unless He did so the
   least little breath of vanity, and of an imperceptible
   self-satisfaction would destroy or spoil these flowers or fruits. When
   you are in a state to be able to bear, and to enjoy them without
   danger, God will open your eyes, and then you will only praise and
   bless Him without any reverting to yourself, and ascribe all the glory
   of your deliverance to your divine Redeemer. In the meantime follow the
   guidance given you now by His Holy Spirit, and do not let fear enter
   your heart. Understand that in all that you actually experience there
   is no sin, since you endure it with so much pain and would only be too
   happy to put an end to these wretched effects of your sensitiveness.
   Maintain yourself in this holy desire, pray for it patiently, above
   all, humble yourself before God; it is for Him to complete the work He
   has begun in you, no one else could succeed in it. Understand that this
   is the little sacrifice that God demands of you before filling your
   heart with the ineffable delights of His pure love. You will have no
   rest till this merciful design of God shall be realised because your
   heart cannot exist without love. Let us pray, then, that this thirst
   may be satisfied by the love of God alone, that He and He alone may
   captivate our hearts, that He may sustain, possess, enlighten, and
   change them.

   5th. The abyss of misery and corruption in which God seems to take
   pleasure in seeing you plunged is, to my judgment, the chief of graces
   since it is the true foundation of all self-distrust, and of an entire
   confidence in God, the two poles of the interior life; at any rate, of
   all graces it is the one I like best, and that I find most frequently
   in souls that are far advanced. What you think of yourself, therefore,
   although terrible, is nevertheless perfectly true and very well
   founded, for, if God were to leave you to yourself you would be a heap
   of all that is evil and a monster of iniquity. But God makes this great
   truth known to very few people, because few are capable of bearing it
   properly, that is to say, in peace, in confidence, in God only, without
   anxiety or discouragement.

   6th. There is no other remedy for these frequent infidelities than to
   lament them, peacefully to humble yourself, and to return to God as
   soon as possible. We shall carry these afflictions and humiliations
   during the whole of our lives, because we shall always be ungrateful
   and unfaithful; but, as long as it is so only through the frailty of
   our nature, without any affection of the heart, that is enough. God
   knows our weakness, He knows the extent of our misery and how incapable
   we are of avoiding all infidelity; He sees also that we have need of
   being reduced to this state of misery without which we could not resist
   the continual attacks of pride, presumption, and secret
   self-confidence. Be careful not to get discouraged even when you find
   that the resolutions so often renewed, of belonging entirely to God,
   fail. Make use of these constant experiences, to enter more deeply into
   the profound abyss of your nothingness and corruption. Learn a complete
   distrust of yourself to depend only on God. Often repeat: "Lord I can
   do nothing without Your help. Enlightened by sad experience I can
   depend on nothing but Your all-powerful grace, and the more unworthy I
   feel, the more do I hope, because my unworthiness will more surely draw
   down Your mercy." You cannot carry your confidence in God too far. An
   infinite goodness and mercy should produce an infinite confidence.

   7th. It is a very subtle and imperceptible illusion of self-love to
   wish to know how you stand with regard to the mystical death, under the
   pretext of being able to act so as to render this death more complete
   in you. You will never know it in this life, neither would it be
   expedient for you to know it, because even supposing a soul to be
   entirely dead to self; if it became conscious of the fact, it would run
   a great risk of losing this state; because self-love would be so much
   pleased, and so satisfied with this assurance that it would rise to
   life again, and begin a new existence more sensitive and difficult to
   destroy than the first.

   Oh, God! how subtle is this wretched self-love! It turns and twists
   like a serpent, and is only too successful in preserving its life in
   the midst of the most fearful deaths. This is of all illusions the most
   specious. Have a horror of this accursed self-love, but learn that, in
   spite of all your efforts it will not die completely and radically
   until the last moment of your life.

   8th. The impression of the sanctity of God which throws you into such a
   state of confusion and pain, without, however, causing you trouble is,
   I am assured, a great grace, more precious and more certain than the
   consolation by which it is succeeded. I can, then, only wish for you
   that it may continue. Do not resist it, let yourself be abased,
   humiliated, annihilated. Nothing is better calculated to purify your
   soul, and you could not approach Holy Communion in a disposition more
   in keeping with a state of annihilation to which Jesus Christ has
   reduce Himself in this mystery. He will not be able to repulse you if
   you approach Him in a spirit of humility and as though annihilated in
   the profound abyss of your misery. If you have not the impulse, nor the
   facility to discover your interior state after having begged this
   grace, you must remain in peace and silence. Your discouragement is a
   sign of a want of purity of intention and is a very dangerous
   temptation, because you must onIy desire to improve, to please God, and
   not to please yourself. You must, therefore, be always satisfied with
   whatever God wills or permits since His will alone should be the rule,
   and the exact limit of your desires, however holy they may be. Besides,
   you must never get it into your head that you have arrived at a certain
   state, or you will become self-satisfied, which would be a grievous
   misfortune. The most certain sign of our progress is the conviction of
   our misery. We shall, therefore, be all the more rich the more we think
   ourselves poor, and the more we humble ourselves, distrust ourselves,
   and are more disposed to place all our confidence in God alone. And
   this is just what God has begun to give you, therefore let there be
   neither anxiety nor discouragement. Each day you must say to yourself,
   "To-day I am going to begin." I greatly applaud the practice you have
   adopted of never upholding your own judgment, and of allowing yourself
   to be blamed and criticised even in circumstances where you believed
   you had good reasons to excuse yourself. You sacrifice, you say, the
   good opinion that you wish others to have of you, and you keep silence
   although until now you would have thought that it would be better to
   defend yourself that your conduct might give edification when that
   which was said against you was untrue. This is my answer: To endure
   every kind of blame and unjust accusation in silence without uttering a
   single word in justification under any pretext whatever is according to
   the spirit of the Gospel, and in conformity with the example of Jesus
   Christ and of all the saints. Your ideas to the contrary were the
   result of a pure illusion; therefore, keep firm to your new and holy
   conduct. You are right in saying that we carry a fund of corruption
   inseparable from our nature, and that it resembles muddy stagnant water
   that gives out an intolerable stench when it is stirred. That is an
   unquestionable truth, and God has given you a great grace in making you
   feel it so keenly. From this feeling will come, gradually, a holy
   hatred and complete distrust of yourself in which true humility
   principally consists.

  Letter II.--The Defects of Beginners.

   On the defects of beginners.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am not surprised at the calmness of the person of whom you speak; it
   is the fruit of the humility she practised in opening her heart, in
   spite of her repugnance to doing so; and also the effect of the words
   that God never fails to inspire, in such a case, to those who are
   acting in His place. Make her thoroughly understand that God has begun
   to try her like this to punish her, and to cure her of a subtle hidden
   pride which she has been nursing without noticing it. The greater has
   been the trouble, the more it has shown the greatness of the vanity
   which it has disconcerted, and which rebels at the least humiliation,
   even that which is interior. This person, therefore, must try to divest
   herself gradually of that self-complacency which is hidden in the most
   secret recesses of the heart; whether it be about natural qualities, or
   about those virtues that she may have, or flatters herself that she
   possesses. For, without being careful about it, there may be some
   foolish self-satisfaction in all that; and without allowing it to
   herself she thinks herself superior to others in many ways. A subtle
   self-love feeds on these vanities of the spirit, in the way that
   worldly pride is satisfied with the beauties of the body; and, as the
   latter finds pleasure in thinking continually of its beauty and in
   looking in the mirror; so, in the same way the former takes interior
   delight in all the natural and supernatural gifts which it flatters
   itself to have received from heaven. The remedy for this diabolical
   evil (diabolical, because it is the crime of the proud angel) is--

   1st. To imitate modest women who never contemplate themselves in the
   mirror, or who drive from their minds all vain thoughts about their
   appearance, or exterior accomplishments.

   2nd. To force this self-love often to look at its defects, miseries,
   and weakness, to enjoy abjection, and to feed on contempt.

   3rd. To consider what we have been, what we are, and what we should
   become, if God removed His hand from us. When we neglect to apply
   ourselves to these humiliating reflexions, God, in His fatherly
   goodness, feels obliged to take other means to destroy the secret
   vanity of souls whom He desires to lead to a high state of perfection;
   He allows temptation, or even falls that throw them into the deepest
   confusion to cure them of this inflation of the mind and heart. When
   God makes use of this bitter but salutary remedy, we must be on our
   guard to prevent our hearts rebelling against it, but submit humbly
   without vexation, and without voluntary agitation.

   4th. We ought not to imagine that by dint of reflexions we shall be
   able to lessen our troubles, but should remain as if motionless in the
   bosom of the mercy of God, and let the storm pass without struggling
   against it, and without interior disturbance which would aggravate the
   evil instead of lessening it.

   5th. We should never ask to be delivered from our afflictions since
   they have been brought about by the favourable action of Providence,
   but we must pray for patience with ourselves and others, and for an
   entire resignation.

   6th. Instead of becoming strong-minded, we must become like children by
   a great simplicity, candour, ingenuousness, and openness of heart
   towards those who have the task of guiding us.

   Note.--This letter was addressed in 1731 to Sister Marie-Anne Thérèse
   de Rosen by Fr. de Caussade, and was about a person who was making a
   Retreat. There is every reason to believe that it concerned either
   Madame or Mademoiselle de Lesen whom God had brought back to Himself by
   the trial of the loss of her property, and who had vowed to become a
   Religious, but who was obliged to remain in the world for a long time
   leading a devout life. She made a retreat in 1731 and another in 1732
   in the Convent of the Visitation at Nancy, and had Sister Marie-Anne
   Thérèse de Rosen for her directress. Shortly after she entered the
   Order of the Annunciation at St. Mihiel in 1733.

  Letter III.--The Illusions of the Devil.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux (1735). On
   interior troubles voluntarily entertained and weakness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   For several days past I have had so many letters to write, either for
   this country, or for France, that I have not been able to read your
   long account. I do not disguise from you that it seemed to me very
   useless, because God has given me the grace to thoroughly understand
   your state without my having the trouble to read all this. However, I
   have read the most essential part, that against which you have put a
   particular mark, and it has only confirmed the opinion I had formed of
   you some time ago. Excuse me, my dear Sister, if I insist on the same
   direction that I have always hitherto given you. Until now you have
   derived great benefit from having followed it, why then allow yourself
   to be misguided by the illusions of the devil? I am not speaking to you
   at random, but with full conviction, do then believe me, and prove, by
   your docility that the confidence with which you honour me is not a
   vain pretence. If you really have a good will, if you are sincerely and
   earnestly resolved to belong to God, you ought to make every effort to
   maintain yourself in peace in order not to give the lie to the message
   of the angels, "Peace to men of goodwill." But you must expect that
   Satan will exert every effort to prevent you acquiring a peace so
   desirable. I know that, unfortunately, he has but too well succeeded up
   to now. The greatest evil in your soul at present is that of anxiety,
   uneasiness and interior agitation. This malady is, thank God, not
   incurable, but as long as it remains unhealed it cannot but be even
   more dangerous than painful to you. Interior disturbance renders the
   soul incapable of listening to, and following the voice of the divine
   Spirit, of receiving the sweet and delightful impressions of His grace,
   and of applying itself to pious exercises, and to exterior duties. It
   is the same with such sick and afflicted souls as with bodies enfeebled
   by fever, which cannot accomplish any serious task until delivered from
   their malady. And as there is a certain analogy between them there is
   also some resemblance between the remedies to be used. The health of
   the body can only be restored by three means, obedience to the
   physician, rest, and good food. These are, likewise, the three means of
   restoring peace and health to a soul that is agitated, sick, and almost
   in agony.

   The first condition for its cure is obedience, a childlike blind
   obedience founded on the principle that God, having authorised His
   priests to guide us cannot allow those souls to be deceived who, on
   this account, abandon themselves blindly to their guidance. Before all
   things, therefore, make your virtue consist in the renunciation of your
   own judgment, and in a humble and generous intention of believing and
   doing all that your director judges, before God, to be expedient. If
   you are animated with this spirit of obedience you will never allow
   yourself voluntarily to entertain thoughts opposed to what has been
   enjoined you, and you will take good care not to give in to the
   inclination to examine and scrutinize everything. If, however, in spite
   of yourself, some thoughts contrary to obedience enter your mind, you
   must reject them, or better still, despise them as dangerous
   temptations.

   The second remedy for your complaint is rest, and peace for your soul.
   To acquire this, you must first of all desire it ardently, and pray to
   God earnestly for it, and then work with all your might to acquire it.
   If you wish to know how to set about this task I will tell you.

   Be very careful not to allow any thoughts which would bring about
   uneasiness, sadness, or depression to remain in your mind. These
   thoughts are, in one sense, more dangerous than temptations to
   impurity; you must, therefore, let them alone, without dwelling on
   them; despise them, and let them fall like a stone into the sea. Resist
   them by fixing your mind on contrary ideas, and above all by making
   aspirations suitable for the occasion, with sighs and interior
   groanings accompanied by acts of humility. But this struggle while
   being energetic and generous must also be quiet, tranquil and peaceful,
   because if it were to be restless, unhappy, ill-humoured and wild, the
   remedy would be worse than the disease. In the second place avoid in
   your actions, whether exterior or interior, all eagerness, hurry, and
   natural activity; accustom yourself on the contrary, to speak, to walk,
   to pray and to read quietly, slowly, without overexerting yourself no
   matter for what, not even to repulse the most frightful temptations.
   You must remember that if these temptations are displeasing to you that
   is the best sign that you have not consented to them. As long as the
   free will feels nothing but horror at, and hatred for the objects
   presented to the imagination in these temptations, it is evident that
   it does not in any way consent to them. Keep yourself, therefore, in
   peace in the midst of these temptations as you have done in other
   trials.

   1st. It only remains then to cure the weakness resulting from the fever
   which torments a soul in trouble. For that a strengthening diet is
   necessary--that is to say--to read good books, and to get accustomed to
   read very slowly with frequent pauses more to try and take an interest
   in what you read than to make use of the intellect in reflexions on it.
   Remember the wise saying of Fénélon, "The words we read are like the
   bark of the tree, but the interest we take in them is like the sap
   which feeds and fattens the soul." We must act as regards this
   spiritual nourishment as gluttons and sensualists act with regard to
   their feasts which they taste in remembrance, and enjoy after having
   swallowed them.

   2nd. We must only speak on useful and edifying subjects, and with those
   who are most capable of leading us to God by their holy conversation.

   3rd. Never seek consolation from creatures by useless intercourse. This
   is an essential matter for those who are suffering interior trials.
   God, who sends them for our good, desires that we should bear them
   without going elsewhere for consolation, but to Him; and He claims the
   right to settle the moment when such consolation should be given to us.

   4th. We must apply ourselves, each according to his or her capacity and
   attraction to interior prayer, but without intense application or
   strain, keeping very quietly in the holy presence of God, addressing
   Him occasionally by some interior act of adoration, repentance,
   confidence, or love. If, however, it is not possible to make such acts,
   we must be content with the good desire of doing so; for, whether for
   good or evil, desire is equivalent to an act in the sight of God.
   Bossuet, somewhere in his works very truly says: "Desire is, with
   regard to God, what the voice and words are with regard to men. We ask,
   and return thanks by the desires we have, which say everything, and
   make our petitions known to God much more distinctly than any words
   could do, or even those interior acts which are called particular and
   formal." This is what gave rise to the saying that a cry uttered only
   in the depths of the heart is the same in the sight of Him Who sounds
   all hearts, as a cry that pierces the heavens.

   5th. It is necessary to put this manner of praying into practice, not
   only at morning devotions, but also during the whole day in a quiet,
   easy, tender, and affectionate manner by frequently raising the heart
   to God, or by an interior attention to the divine presence. To gain
   greater facility you might review in the morning nearly every event
   both interior and exterior, likely to occur during the day, and ask
   yourself, "If I find myself in such a circumstance, or such a position,
   what shall I say to God, what act should I make?" and if, when the time
   arrives you are prevented from carrying out your good intentions, you
   can be content to adhere to them, even if only indistinctly, and to lay
   before God your inability. Finally the best food for the soul consists
   in willing in all and for all what God wills; or, in other words to
   adhere to all the designs of divine Providence in every imaginable
   circumstance whether interior or exterior, health or sickness, aridity,
   distractions, weariness, disgusts, temptations, etc., and to accept all
   this very heartily, saying, "Yes, my God, I will everything; I accept
   all, I sacrifice all to You; or, at any rate I wish to do so, and ask
   for this grace, help me and strengthen my weakness." In the most
   fearful temptations say to Him, "My God, preserve me from sin in this
   matter; but I willingly accept as much confusion to my pride, and
   interior abjection and humiliation as You will and long as You will, I
   unite my will to Yours."

   The most uneasy and enfeebled soul could not fail to recover its lost
   peace and joy if it adopted these means for regaining them.

  Letter II.--Interior Troubles.

   To the same person. Interior troubles (1755).
     __________________________________________________________________

   If my letter distressed you, my dear Sister, I will say to you with St.
   Paul, that I rejoice not, indeed, at your affliction, but at the good
   effect it has produced. It is good to recognise that one has been
   culpable in many ways, not in order to reproach oneself in a hard,
   bitter, angry, and disturbed manner, but to humble oneself quietly and
   peacefully without self-contempt or bitterness. You do not consider
   yourself disobedient, you say, in relating to me quite frankly your
   fears and doubts. That is not the question, my dear Sister; but what
   is, is that you continue to cling to your fears and doubts; you study
   them too much, instead of despising them and abandoning yourself
   entirely to God, as I have preached to you for a long time past.
   Without this happy and holy abandonment you will never enjoy a solid
   peace full of absolute confidence in God alone, through Jesus Christ.

   But, I ask you again, what have you to fear in this abandonment,
   especially after such evident signs of the very great mercy of God
   towards you? You are endeavouring to find help in yourself and your
   works, and to satisfy your conscience, as if your works gave your
   conscience greater security and stronger support than the mercy of God,
   and the merits of Jesus Christ; and as though they could not deceive
   you. I pray God to enlighten you, and to give you a change of heart
   about this matter so essential to you. You say that I should feel
   distressed and surprised if you laid bare to me all that you
   experience. This is exactly what people in your state so often say to
   me, people with whom I am not so well acquainted as with you. Here is
   my answer to you, and to others like you. The keen perception of faults
   and imperfections is the grace suitable to this state, and it is a very
   precious grace. Why? First because this clear view of our miseries
   keeps us humble, and even sometimes inspires us with a wholesome horror
   and a holy fear of ourselves. Secondly, because this state, apparently
   so miserable and so desperate gives occasion to an heroic abandonment
   into the hands of God. Those who have gauged the depths of their own
   nothingness can no longer retain any kind of confidence in themselves,
   nor trust in any way to their works in which they can discover nothing
   but misery, self-love, and corruption. This absolute distrust and
   complete disregard of self is the source from which alone flow those
   delightful consolations of souls wholly abandoned to God, and form
   their inalterable peace, holy joy and immovable confidence in God only.
   Oh! if you but knew the gift of God, the value, merit, power, peace and
   holy assurance of salvation hidden in this state of abandonment, you
   would soon be delivered from all your fears and anxieties. But you
   imagine you will be lost directly you think of abandoning yourself; and
   yet the most efficacious means of salvation is to practise this total
   and perfect abandonment. I have never yet come across any who have so
   set themselves against making this act of abandonment to God as you.
   Nevertheless you will, necessarily, have to come to it, at least at the
   hour of death; because, without an express revelation and assurance of
   eternal salvation, no one can be free from fear at the last moment, and
   therefore, every one is absolutely compelled then to abandon themselves
   to the very great mercy of God.

   "But," you say, "if I had lived a holy life and performed some good
   works I might think myself authorised to practise this abandonment, and
   to divest myself of my fears." An illusion, my dear Sister. Such
   language can only have been inspired by your unhappy self-love, which
   desires to be able to trust entirely to itself, whereas you ought to
   place your confidence only in God and in the infinite merits of Jesus
   Christ. You have never really thoroughly fathomed this essential point
   but have always stopped short to examine into your fears and doubts
   instead of rising above them, and throwing yourself heart and soul into
   the hands of God, and upon His fatherly breast. In other words you
   always want to have a distinct assurance based on yourself, in order to
   abandon yourself better. Most certainly this is anything but an
   abandonment to God in complete confidence in Him only, but, rather, a
   secret desire of being able to depend on yourself before abandoning
   yourself to His infinite goodness. This is to act like a state criminal
   who, before abandoning himself to the clemency of the king, wishes to
   be assured of his pardon. Can this be called depending on God, hoping
   only in God? Judge for yourself! And God has for so long a time been
   calling you to this state of abandonment in filial confidence. And you,
   instead of responding to this loving call allow yourself to be
   tyrannised over, and martyrised by a slavish fear. I greatly insist on
   this matter, because experience has taught me that this is the last
   battle of grace for souls in your state; the last step to take in
   forsaking self, and the one that costs the most. But it seems to me
   that no one has ever offered so much resistance as you. This proceeds
   from a very strongly rooted self-love, from a secret great presumption
   and confidence in yourself that, possibly, you may never have found
   out; for, mark well, that directly you are spoken to about this total
   abandonment to God you feel a certain interior commotion as though all
   were lost, and as if you had been told to throw yourself, with your
   eyes shut, into an abyss. It seems a trifle, yet it is very much the
   contrary, for the greatest assurance of salvation in this life can only
   be obtained in this total abandonment, and this consists, as Fénélon
   says, in becoming thoroughly tired of, and driven to despair of
   oneself, and made to hope only in God. Weigh well the force of these
   words which at first sight seem too strong and exaggerated.

   However, to bring you to this state of total abandonment God has
   imparted to you two great graces. Firstly, a powerful attraction to
   induce you to place all your confidence in His very great mercy and
   goodness; secondly, a great knowledge of, and a very penetrating
   insight into your miseries, weaknesses, perversity, powerlessness to
   act well, etc.; as if to say to you: "You see that in this state you
   neither ought nor can, in any sort of way, depend on yourself, since
   you are nothing but a heap of corruption. Let Me then, have the care of
   you, and forsake yourself once for all, to depend only on Me." "But how
   shall I work out my salvation?" What! do you not understand that the
   most certain way of assuring this is to leave the care of it entirely
   to God, and to occupy yourself only with Him; as a man in the
   confidence of a great king leaves the question of recompense to him,
   and thinks only of the service and interests of his master. Do you not
   think that, in acting in this generous manner he would be doing better
   for himself than others who, more selfish, would think continually of
   what they might gain or obtain? But are we not commanded to think of
   ourselves, to enter into ourselves, to watch over ourselves? Yes,
   certainly, when beginning to enter the service of God in order to
   detach ourselves from the world, to forsake exterior objects, to
   correct the bad habits we have contracted, but, afterwards we must
   forget ourselves to think only of God, forsake ourselves to belong to
   God alone. But as for you, you wish to remain always wrapped up in
   yourself, in your, so-called, spiritual interests; and God, to draw you
   out of this last resource of self-love, allows you to find nothing in
   yourself but a source of fears, doubts, uncertainty, trouble, anxiety
   and depression, as though this God of all goodness said by this,
   "Forget yourself, and you will find in Me only, peace, spiritual joy,
   calmness, and an absolute assurance of salvation. I am the God of your
   salvation, and you can be nothing but the cause of your own
   destruction."

   But again you say, "In this forgetfulness of self, far from correcting
   myself of my sins and imperfections, I do not even know them." An
   error! an illusion! ignorance! Never can you more clearly detect your
   faults than in the clear light of the presence of God. This is like an
   interior sunshine, which, without necessitating a constant
   self-examination makes us see and understand everything by a simple
   impression. In this way also, better than in any other, all our defects
   and imperfections are gradually consumed like straw in a fire. And then
   how happy is this state at which you should have arrived a long time
   ago! and of which God has given, and still gives me frequent
   experience. As the human heart is a bottomless abyss of misery and
   corruption, the more the light of God penetrates into it the more sad
   and humiliating are the objects disclosed; but at the same time these
   fresh disclosures, far from grieving the soul, console it in keeping it
   in an interior humility which it knows to be the solid foundation of
   the whole spiritual edifice. Far from disturbing its holy joy, and
   casting it down they inspire in it a solid confidence which it feels is
   placed in God alone, and that this confidence, according to Holy
   Scripture, has never been confounded. I have known, and know now many
   souls that, following this method, are astonished to find that the more
   feeble, poor, and miserable they realise themselves to be, the greater
   becomes their confidence in God. The reason of this is that in
   proportion to our insight into our own misery and corruption will be
   our distrust in ourselves and our confidence in God. God then imparts
   to those souls which have acquired this insight, an absolute
   self-distrust joined to an entire confidence in Him, from which
   proceeds total abandonment; these are the two strong springs of the
   spiritual life, and as long as you are in this state you run no risk of
   your salvation.

   In abandoning all to God, therefore, we regain all in Him alone and
   with profit to our souls. In this way we are delivered once for all
   from these foolish self-examinations, fears, troubles, and uneasiness;
   in one word from these tortures to which those self-engrossed souls
   condemn themselves who wish to love God only out of self-love, who seek
   salvation and perfection, not so much to please God and to glorify Him,
   as for their own interests and eternal happiness.

   But, you will say, God commands us to desire our salvation and eternal
   felicity. Yes, without doubt, but according to, and in submission to
   the ordaining of His will. Well! this is God's rule, which it is
   necessary for you to understand thoroughly; God has created us for His
   own glory and to do His will, and He could not have created us for any
   other purpose, for He owes this to Himself, and to His own sovereign
   dominion; but, as He is also infinitely merciful He has so arranged
   that His creatures find their own interests and eternal happiness in
   doing His will. But see how this miserable self-love which seeks itself
   before all else, reverses the order of things. We want first and
   principally to provide for our own interests, spiritual and eternal,
   and as for the glory of God, in our preoccupation we give Him only the
   second place. God sees this subversion with a jealous eye in souls He
   has loaded with graces, and by which He desires to be loved with a pure
   and disinterested affection! and, in order to make them return to this
   right order of things He sends them troubles, fears and interior
   agitation, seeking by means of these secret trials to destroy that
   self-love so harmful to them. He desires to induce them by degrees to
   think less of themselves and their own interests, and to occupy
   themselves quietly with Him alone by abandoning to Him the care and
   management of their salvation; and this is the meaning of those words
   of Jesus Christ addressed to many holy souls. "My daughter think of me
   and I will think of you, busy yourself for My glory, and allow Me to
   occupy Myself with your interests and eternal welfare."

   As for us, what are we doing when we always worry, and are busied about
   ourselves? It is as though we said, "Lord, what are you saying? I shall
   be lost if I do not continually think about my own soul, if I am not
   constantly asking myself how I stand with you, and what is going to
   become of me. This is what I am obliged to do without ceasing. As for
   what concerns Your glory and Your good pleasure I can only think of
   them now and then. I hope I shall be able to occupy myself with them
   more habitually by the time I have conquered all my faults, and it is
   proved to me that I shall risk nothing by this constant attention to
   Your divine interests. But first of all I cannot now decide about it
   for I should consider myself lost and You wish me before all things to
   try and provide for the safety of my soul." To those of His spouses who
   address such language to Him, this is the very clear and concise reply
   of our Lord in the Gospel, "Whosoever loveth his life shall lose it,
   and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life
   eternal." And, in fact, I have never met with souls which have a
   greater horror of sin, more strength for the practice of virtue, or
   which make greater sacrifices for God when occasions arise than those
   souls which seem never to think of themselves but depend upon Him for
   everything, including their salvation. It is in this state that
   salvation is most certain; from which I conclude that not only
   scruples, but excessive fears, distressing doubts, spiritual trials and
   bitterness of heart, are caused by selfish feelings, a greater
   preoccupation about personal interests than about the glory of God and
   a desire to please Him out of pure love and all that should take the
   first place in our hearts. Since He is the sovereign good, love of Him
   should take precedence of the charity we owe ourselves. And since He
   has promised to love those who love Him, and to love most those who
   love Him only, we can be assured that in making use of all our powers
   to love Him for Himself we shall regain with interest by this pure love
   all that we seem to have sacrificed; therefore, far from losing, we
   gain all in abandoning ourselves entirely to God by love and
   confidence. The sight of that confused heap of weaknesses, miseries,
   unworthiness, and of all corruption should never distress you. It is on
   this account that I say boldly, all is well, for I have never known a
   soul endowed with this keen insight, so humiliating to it, to whom it
   was not a most singular grace of God; nor who has not found in it,
   combined with a true knowledge of itself, that solid humility which is
   the foundation of all perfection. I have known, and do know many
   saintly souls who, for their sole possession have that profound
   conviction of their misery, and are never so happy as when they feel
   themselves, as it were, engulfed in it. They then dwell in truth, and
   consequently in God Who is the sovereign truth. If you but knew how to
   walk before Him, your head bowed in this spirit of self-effacement, you
   would find in it all that makes the spiritual life. It only remains to
   know how to preserve this spirit of peace and abandonment. Would to God
   that you had the grace to pass all your time of prayer in this holy
   interior self-humiliation, engulfed in your misery, but in peace,
   submission, resignation and confidence. Then I should say to you: stay
   as you are, and all is well; God will do the rest, and perhaps without
   you knowing, or feeling that He is doing it.

   You are trembling over your state, and I am blessing God for it. I only
   wish you changed in one particular, and that is that your
   self-humiliation should be mingled with peace, submission, confidence,
   and abandonment, as I have just said. After that I should have no fear
   for you not even about the laxness of which you tell me, which makes
   you walk like a crab. God will prevent great laxness and will allow
   small relaxations to keep you humble. St. Francis of Sales said it was
   an heroic virtue to rise again unceasingly without ever losing courage.

   God be praised in all, and for all.

  Letter V.--On the Love of One's Neighbour.

   To Sister de Lesen. On the love of one's neighbour. Nancy, 1735.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am not at all surprised at the friendship you have for your dear
   relative, and understand that it is due to her for many reasons.
   However, because by your own showing this affection disturbs you, and
   prevents you giving your whole heart to God, there must needs be some
   irregularity about it. If you wish to sanctify it, and to render it
   altogether supernatural, this is what God demands of you.

   1st. That you will not allow yourself to think about this person too
   often nor to be engrossed by thoughts of her; there is moderation in
   all things.

   2nd. That in the illnesses and afflictions she has to endure you will
   submit to them as a sacrifice you must make to God, and abandon
   yourself to Him so that He may dispose of her, and of you in all
   things, and about all things according to His most holy will and loving
   good pleasure. You must know that in abandoning her thus to the will
   and care of divine Providence you render her, as well as yourself, the
   greatest possible service, since by this sacrifice you place her in the
   hands of God Who is infinitely good, and infinitely powerful.

   We must certainly make use of our reasoning faculties in our trials;
   but, as a very holy and learned Christian has well said, we must not
   depend too much on this feeble faculty which is stronger in opposition
   to what is good, than in overcoming evil. It is religion, and the grace
   we obtain through humble prayer which can sustain us. Sadness,
   depression, interior rebellion when our relatives suffer from various
   causes, taking rise in a too affectionate disposition, will be a grand
   occasion of virtue and merit to us, if, endeavouring to raise ourselves
   by faith above our natural feelings, we understand that all has to be
   sacrificed to the adorable and most holy will of God. Do we not know
   that nothing can happen in this world without His permission, and that
   He has arranged everything for the greater good of those who submit to
   Him, or, at least who desire to acquire and to practise this
   submission?

   If we could only understand the value of this virtue! Of all the means
   of salvation this is, together with the fulfilment of the divine
   precepts, the most universal, and the most infallible. Nothing more is
   required to sanctify most people and to lighten for them the trials of
   life. A wise pagan thought in this way when he said, "If one has a
   sensitive nature, and is accustomed to foster in oneself what the world
   calls refined and generous sentiments, it is no easy matter to cure
   oneself of thinking too much about the family honour, and of taking too
   great an interest in family affairs, and also of being too much moved
   by every incident affecting those to whom we are most tenderly
   attached." It is necessary to pray much about this, and also to reflect
   how to combat it. Firstly, to reflect on the uselessness of our worries
   and our feelings, and on the harm they do ourselves, as much to the
   bodily health, as to the welfare of the soul. Secondly, to combat it by
   refraining from frequent, lengthy, and earnest thoughts on the subject,
   and by sacrificing and abandoning it entirely to God in spite of the
   pangs the heart must endure from the violence of such sacrifices;
   consider that, after all, there is only one thing necessary, and that
   provided that this great affair succeeds everything else must be as God
   pleases. These feelings are quickly overcome, or rather, they are so
   trifling and paltry that they pass like shadows, to return no more. Let
   us act like worldly people when they have to attend to business of the
   utmost importance on which depend their honour, their life, their
   property, in fact everything, as they think. They have nothing else in
   their minds day or night but this important business, and neglect
   everything else as being nothing in comparison. As Jesus Christ has
   said, we must learn from the children of this world who are "wiser in
   their generation than the children of light." Remember that what can
   help to save us is not exterior solitude, nor retirement, for these can
   be had even in the world; but an interior withdrawal and solitude of
   the mind and heart; of the mind, by banishing superfluous cares and
   thoughts and by endeavouring to make God the absorbing occupation of
   the heart, by lamenting its defects, by humbling it and frequently
   sighing after God, and by detaching it gradually from the creature to
   attach it solely to the Creator. He is the supreme truth, and nothing
   has any reality apart from Him. Consequently purely temporal interests,
   the business, the honours, pleasures, or sufferings of this lower world
   are nought but shadows and phantoms; they appear to exist, but, in
   reality, are nothing.

  Letter VI.--On Attachments.

   To Sister Anne-Marguerite Boudet de la Bellière. On attachment too
   keenly felt.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear daughter in Jesus Christ. I cannot thank God enough for
   this great desire of giving yourself to Him without reserve that He has
   bestowed on you with the courage which inspires you to make so many
   little sacrifices, and to moderate even the most harmless attachments.
   Oh! my dear Sister, how thoroughly God has enlightened you about this,
   and how many dangers you will escape if you are faithful in following
   this light. We, unhappily, find only too many who, making profession of
   piety, are caught in this snare, and thus prevented from making any
   progress. With the excuse that there is no sin in the attachments they
   allow themselves, they give themselves up to them without scruple, and
   thus place an impenetrable barrier to the grace, and the communications
   of God. He desires to fill and inflame their hearts with His pure love,
   but how can He do so as long as those hearts are distracted by foolish
   amusements, and filled with a miserable love for some creature? You
   know what a dangerous snare this was for St. Teresa, and in truth after
   such an example you cannot be too much on your guard. Go on then,
   detaching yourself more and more, and I assure you that in proportion
   as your detachment becomes more complete you will feel more drawn to
   God, to prayer, recollection and the practice of every virtue; for,
   when the heart is empty in this way God fills it, and then one can do
   everything easily and pleasantly, because all is done out of love, and
   that, you know, makes all things easy, and sweetens all bitterness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VII.--Personal Attachments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Allow me to tell you in all sincerity, a fear that makes me anxious
   about you. It seems to me that your too frequent intercourse with the
   members of your numerous family, and with other people from outside,
   raises a serious obstacle to your advancement. Take care that, while
   trying to do good to others, you do no harm to yourself. Although I am
   obliged by my vocation to have more communication with the world than
   you, I assure you nevertheless, that I find it very good for my soul to
   keep these communications within bounds. Since I came here I have only
   made necessary visits, and try as much as possible to avoid receiving
   them. To those who come to me I speak only of God, of salvation, or of
   eternity. This is the rule laid down by St. Ignatius and one which he
   declared suited him well. If people like this kind of conversation they
   will profit by it, and their visit will not have been a waste of time;
   if they do not care for it they will not come again, or, at any rate
   not so often, and then I shall have more time left me for my priestly
   duties. It is useless to expect to make any progress as long as your
   mind is filled with news from outside, and your heart preoccupied with
   temporal affairs. The first condition for the interior life is
   recollection. I cannot urge you too strongly to restrict your
   communications and, to follow the plan of St. Ignatius about those that
   you think you ought to retain. This plan is better suited to a
   Religious, who is obliged by her vocation to keep secluded, than to
   other people. Far from being surprised, people in the world cannot but
   be edified at the fidelity with which she conforms her conduct to her
   vocation. On the contrary, if by these useless communications with
   people in the world she frequented society too much, she would only
   scandalise them, and would also lose all those graces which she might
   have acquired by her communications with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VIII.--On Natural Activity.

   To Sister Marie-Henriette de Bousmard. On natural activity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I wish, my dear Sister, that you were able to understand well all the
   harm that the excessive activity of your nature, unless completely
   under the rule and direction of grace, will infallibly cause you. This
   is one of those defects that the world mistakes for virtues, but which
   is none the less disastrous to the soul in its progress in the path of
   sanctity. Natural activity is the enemy of abandonment, without which,
   as I have often told you, there can be no real perfection. It prevents,
   obstructs, or spoils all the operations of grace, and substitutes, in
   the soul which succumbs to it, the impulsion of the human spirit for
   that of the divine Spirit. In fact there is no doubt that the
   impetuosity with which we give ourselves up to good works proceeds from
   a hidden source of self-confidence, and a thoughtless presumption that
   makes us imagine that we are doing or can do great things. How much
   more modest and reserved we should be if we were thoroughly penetrated
   with the undoubted truth that we have nothing of our own, and are
   utterly powerless to do anything good, but only powerful for evil. To
   cure, and to tear up by the root an evil so fruitful in imperfections,
   and even in sins, requires much time and much trouble. These are the
   means I most recommend to you.

   1st. To be thoroughly convinced, by past and present experience, of
   your own weakness and misery, in order to distrust more and more your
   own works even to the length of feeling a kind of horror of them.

   2nd. To repress your excessive exterior activity by performing all your
   actions without eagerness or hurry, quite gently and quietly, as St.
   Francis of Sales advises.

   3rd. To do the same in all your spiritual exercises, and always to
   mortify the initial eagerness with which you start any good work, no
   matter what it may be; to undertake it only under the influence of the
   pure Spirit of God, and by the peaceful impulse of grace.

   4th. When you pray and hold intercourse with God interiorly, try to
   avoid all sensible ardour, all that fiery fervour, and excitement of
   the imagination characteristic of beginners. To effect this, follow the
   advice of St. Francis of Sales and manage so that all your interior
   acts shall flow, and be drawn from, and distilled by, the highest point
   of the mind, so that you hardly feel that you are praying and making
   acts. Far from these acts being, on this account, less fruitful, they
   make a deeper impression on the soul and penetrate more deeply and more
   pleasantly into the heart.

   5th. When you feel, however confusedly, that something is acting in
   your soul, the stronger this impression is, the more necessary it is to
   keep quiet and still, and as though in a state of inaction, so that you
   may not spoil all by interfering unseasonably.

   6th. When God makes you experience certain consolations, or strong
   emotions, instead of giving yourself up to them with a sensual avidity,
   behave with the reserve and modesty of a mortified person invited to a
   great feast.

   7th. During the day let the principal interior occupation be what is
   called simple interior waiting, silent, peaceful, and entirely
   resigned; and do not think that this is idleness, waste of time, or in
   any way useless, because, as a beggar who waits the whole day long at a
   rich man's gate, or at the church door, is by no means idle but much
   occupied interiorly with his own misery, his wants and continual
   necessities; so, in the same way, a soul in this simple waiting before
   God is very much occupied interiorly, and in this simple manner is
   making the following acts; of faith in the presence of God, of
   adoration before this great God whose infinite power and mercy it
   acknowledges; of self-distrust; of profound humility in thinking itself
   incapable of anything; of desire for the holy operations of God, of
   hope since one does not wait for what one does not expect to receive;
   and of abandonment to divine Providence in regard to all His gifts or
   operations. And although these acts may not be accurately performed,
   specified, nor sensible, yet they are none the less there, at the
   bottom of the heart; and God, at least, sees them in our desires, and
   in our state of preparation. Now, as you are aware, our wishes and
   desires, even if only begun to be formed, are to God what the voice is
   to our fellow men. He hears them, in fact, far more clearly than men
   hear our voices, and it is enough for Him that we form these desires;
   for, as the Psalmist says He knows even the mere intention and
   disposition of our hearts from the first moment that they begin to
   turn, and to move towards Him. And this, by the way is very consoling
   to you in the present state of your soul. But a still more efficacious
   way than any other is to bear patiently darkness, dryness, coldness and
   weakness. This sad state is the specific remedy employed by God to
   suppress natural activity by reducing us to our own nothingness.
   Without this we should never be able to overcome it, because the
   inordinate activity of our powers cannot be regulated until, by
   constantly reiterated efforts, we force them to act only under the
   influence of the Spirit of God, and by His grace, and never of
   themselves, or by themselves. You see in this how blindly and unjustly
   we act when we turn the benefits of God into subjects of affliction and
   complaint; for they not only tend to extinguish our natural activity
   but to kill our self-love, and to enable us to live the supernatural
   life of grace.

  Letter IX.--On Excessive Fervour.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On excessive fervour of good
   desires.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear Sister,

   The desire about which you have consulted me is very good in itself,
   but I fear lest it may become too strong. If you wish that it may not
   be hurtful to you under the appearance of good, you must manage to be
   always submissive and resigned about it, and consequently, peaceful.
   You know how, in even our best desires, nature and passion get mixed,
   making them violent, restless, hasty and wild. For this reason, and to
   preserve us from this danger, and also gradually purify our desires,
   even those that are most saintly, God defers granting them for a long
   time. For the wild desires of our natural inclinations do not deserve
   to be answered, only those desires formed by the Holy Spirit deserve to
   be heard by God, and these are always quiet, gentle and peaceful. Keep
   yourself, as much as possible, in a state of peace and even of a holy
   joy in order to be fit to receive holy impressions. You know that grace
   more easily makes way in hearts that are calm and free than in those
   that are full of uneasiness and trouble, for the latter are more
   exposed to be under the influence of the evil spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter X.--Restraint of Over-Eagerness.

   To the same person. On eagerness to read good books.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I send you the book on "Christian Hope" that I promised you. It will
   prove a real treasure to you, but if you wish to derive from it all the
   fruit that I expect, you must restrain your eagerness to read, and not
   allow yourself to be carried away by curiosity to know what is coming.
   Make use of the time allowed by the Rule to read it, concentrate all
   your attention on what you are actually reading without troubling about
   the rest. I advise you above all, to enter into the meaning of the
   consoling and solid truths that you will find laid down in this book;
   but more in a practical way than by speculative reflexions, and, from
   time to time, make short pauses to allow these truths time to flow
   through all the recesses of the soul and to give occasion for the
   operation of the Holy Spirit who, during these peaceful pauses, and
   times of silent attention, engraves and imprints these heavenly truths
   in the heart. All this, however, without disturbing your attraction, or
   violent effort to prevent reflexions, but simply and quietly trying to
   make them enter into your heart more than into your mind.

   Take particular notice of certain more important chapters, of which you
   are in greater need, in order to read them again when next you have
   time. In general I advise you strongly not to overload your mind with
   readings and outward practices, it is much better to read little, and
   to digest what you read. Just now, too, your soul is in need of unity
   and simplicity, and all your readings and practices should tend to a
   single end, and that is, to form in you a spirit of recollection. In
   time God will give you this grace if you aspire to it with confidence
   quietly, simply, and humbly, without eagerness, trouble, or uneasiness.
   Frequently ask God to detach you absolutely from all things, so at you
   may love and enjoy Him only, in Jesus Christ, and through Jesus Christ,
   in fine, that He may take full possession of your heart and make it
   altogether His. "My God I abandon myself to You, grant that I may
   desire only You."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XI.--Intemperate Zeal.

   To the same person. On intemperate and indiscreet zeal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I see, my dear Sister, that a mistaken zeal exposes you to dangers all
   the more serious because they are hidden under the most insidious
   appearances. Desire for the perfection of our neighbour is, doubtless,
   very good; the pain that is felt interiorly at the sight of his defects
   is good also, provided it proceeds from a pure desire for his
   perfection, But with all this there must needs be mingled much secret
   self-complacency, confidence in one's own superior light, and severity
   towards one's neighbour. Zeal such as this cannot, you must well
   understand, come from God; it is an illusion of the devil, hurtful to
   yourself and to others. However, the evil can be easily cured provided
   you are sincere enough, and submissive enough to recognise the gravity
   of it, and to apply the remedy. That which I am about to offer you has
   already produced a very happy result in a soul which was subject to the
   same illusion. Let us hope it will not be less efficacious in your
   case.

   I advise you, therefore, and command you in the most sacred name of
   Jesus Christ, and that of His divine Mother, never more to think of
   practising the virtue of zeal as long as this prohibition is not
   expressly removed. I exculpate you before God absolutely, and I take
   upon myself the responsibility of all the ill consequences that may
   result from this prohibition. If you should get scruples about it, and
   the devil should put in your mind that you could do some good or avert
   some evil, say to God, "My God, although charity is the queen of
   virtues, I may not practise this zeal until You have made me able to do
   so without detriment to the charity I owe to others and to myself. When
   I am found to be sufficiently strong, or rather sufficiently humble, to
   exercise zeal without disturbing the peace of my soul, and with all
   possible sweetness, compassion, and thoughtfulness for my neighbour,
   and a helpfulness, kindness and charity which nothing can embitter, a
   charity which is scandalised at nothing but its own shortcomings; with
   all that patience and long-suffering which enables one tranquilly to
   endure the defects of others, and for as long as You will suffer them,
   Oh, my God; and when I am neither troubled, nor uneasy, nor astonished
   that others are incorrigible, then this prohibition will be removed,
   and I shall be able to think that I can glorify You in my neighbour.
   But until then, Oh, my God, I must exercise my zeal on myself, in the
   correction of my numerous defects."

   In fact, my very dear Sister, when humility has dug that deep
   foundation indispensable to every virtue, I shall be the first to urge
   you to resume the practice of zeal; until then think only of yourself.
   Remember that God, to punish those who have practised this indiscreet
   zeal, and to correct them, has often allowed them to fall into much
   graver faults than those which has scandalised them in others.

   In the second place I command you never to speak of God, or of anything
   good, unless in a spirit of humility and meekness, in an amiable and
   gracious manner, with moderation and encouragement, and never with
   bitterness and severity, or in a way to wound and repel those who hear
   you, because, although you may only say what is in the Gospel and in
   the best books, I believe that in your present state of mind you might
   say it very badly and in such a way as only to do harm. Did not Satan
   make use of the words of Holy Scripture to tempt our Lord? Truth is the
   proper relation of things. It is changed when pushed to extremes, or
   wrongly applied. Your peevish temper is like a smoked glass, which, if
   you do not take care will prevent you seeing things in their true
   light, or showing them to others. Keep always on your guard against
   this fatal influence, and feed your mind on thoughts and feelings that
   are contrary to those inspired by temper. Entertain yourself and others
   with conversations on the infinite goodness of God, and on the
   confidence we ought to have in Him. Compel yourself to offer an example
   in your whole conduct, of a virtue that has no bounds, and which
   imposes no restraint on others. If you have nothing kind to say keep
   silent, and leave the care of deciding to others. They can avoid better
   than you too much laxness, and will be exact without being severe. If
   exactitude be praiseworthy, severity is blamable, it does nothing but
   revolt people instead of convincing them, and embitter their souls
   instead of gaining them. As much as true meekness, with the help of
   God, has power to repel evil and to win to good, so much has an
   excessive harshness power to make goodness difficult and evil
   incurable. The first is edifying, the latter, destructive.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XII.--On Obedience.

   On disinclination to accept the comforts enjoined.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Be careful never to leave off the practice of obedience under the
   pretext of mortifying yourself; and never forget these words of the
   Holy Spirit, "I will have obedience and not sacrifice." Do not,
   therefore, hesitate to take those little comforts that the doctors, the
   superiors, and infirmarians prescribe for you; at any rate, you should
   have much scruple about refusing them. In this way you will practise a
   more meritorious self-denial than any bodily mortification--that which
   consists in the renunciation of your own ideas, of your own judgment,
   and of your own will. Through ignorance or forgetfulness of this truth
   certain devout persons, who are strongly attached to their own ideas,
   commit many faults in being obstinately determined in their pretended
   self-denial, and extremely unmortified in their mortifications. How can
   they delude themselves so far as not to understand that self-love
   spoils and corrupts even the most holy practices? Those who renounce
   their own will, their own judgment, and their own ideas for the love of
   God will make great progress in the path of true and solid perfection.
   Henceforth, do not make any other use of your mind and of your reason
   than to know what you are ordered to do, and to do it promptly,
   joyfully, with a great confidence in God, and an absolute abandonment
   to His mercy. It will be all the easier to practise this confidence
   when you no longer have any other ambition than to do His holy will.
   And in fact, could there be a pleasanter task? Does not this divine
   Will sanctify all Its decrees? Follow It then in all things, as much in
   what gives you pleasure, as in that which costs you most; in
   consolations, as well as privations; working and resting; in mental and
   vocal prayer, in the Office, at Mass, in confession and Communion; in
   all things. Blind obedience, makes no exception, it generally
   sacrifices its own thoughts, ideas, judgments, inclinations,
   repugnances, aversions, tempers, in one word all its own will. On this
   account is this sacrifice more pleasing to God than any other that
   could possibly be made, and without this sacrifice all else is of
   little value, and cannot fail to be harmful. The divine Spirit also
   assures us in Holy Scripture, that the obedient man will gain many
   victories.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIII.--On being Self-Opinionated.

   On attachment to one's own judgment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   At last you are freed from your ties and released from all those
   engagements by which the world expected to keep you always captive. I
   do not doubt that you understand the full value of the inestimable
   grace of a religious vocation, and that you are disposed to accomplish
   generously all its duties. The longer you have waited for this grace,
   the greater is the gratitude you owe to Him Who has, at last, bestowed
   it on you. You must, however, be prepared to encounter many
   difficulties in your new life, difficulties not felt by those who
   embrace it earlier; but humility, renunciation, simplicity, and the
   holy spiritual infancy of the Gospel will diminish these difficulties
   considerably and will finish by making them disappear altogether. With
   the help of these virtues you will be preserved from a very subtle
   illusion of pride, to which many novices yield, and which is all the
   more dangerous because it is almost imperceptible. With the excuse of
   trying themselves better, they always want to do a little more than the
   rest, or to deprive themselves of those little comforts that the
   charity of the Superiors offers them. All this is nothing else but a
   refined self-love, and a disguised vanity. As for you, my dear Sister,
   never, I implore you, have any other ambition than to follow the
   ordinary course in all things; not one iota beyond that. Accept with
   simplicity and humility the little comforts and alleviations that the
   weak are allowed, rejoice at seeing yourself reduced to the level of a
   small child and treated like one and take good care not to seem strong
   and courageous. What profound and meritorious humility will you not
   thus exercise! delightful in the eyes of God, and more pleasing to His
   heart than the most austere life chosen by yourself. What an amount of
   pride and vanity may be concealed in conduct contrary to this! I do not
   wish to hide from you what a good long experience has taught me; that
   those who were most devout in the world before entering the religious
   state, have generally given the most trouble to their Superiors and
   Mistresses. This comes of their having formed certain ideas of virtue
   for themselves which they will not relinquish. Accustomed to be admired
   by all who surrounded them, and to be, usually, approved of by their
   directors, they cling to their own ideas and their own spirit without
   suspecting that this attachment is the very antipodes of all true
   sanctity. Therefore it is far more difficult to make those persons
   practise humility and renunciation, to give up their notions and
   self-will than in the case of young people of unformed character; or
   even of worldly people who have become converted. Nevertheless if we do
   not become as little children we shall not enter into the kingdom of
   heaven. I hope, therefore, that you are treated exactly as if you were
   a young person of fifteen or sixteen years of age, equally unformed
   physically and mentally, and who is told: "Sister, you must rest
   to-morrow; you are dispensed from such or such a thing; you must take
   some recreation in the garden," or "My dear Sister, that work is too
   hard for you, the Mother Superior will dispense you from it," while
   you, a formed character, formerly most devout, should, without replying
   by a single word or frowning, carry out all you are told to do, to the
   letter, in a spirit of humility and simplicity, satisfied to be treated
   thus, as if you were the weakest and the least of all. Look upon
   yourself as such, and even rejoice at it, or at least, do your best to
   do so. Admire the loving charity of the Rev. Mother and the Sisters,
   and bless God for it. This is what a true interior spirit, and a
   spirituality that is real and good should teach you, and inspire you
   with. But, it must be admitted it is a most difficult matter to reduce
   these pretended devotees to this. Poor souls! blinded and deceived, the
   less they know how to humble themselves the further they are from real
   greatness. If they would but go to Bethlehem, and there contemplate the
   God of Heaven become a little Infant in swaddling clothes, in a manger,
   handled, carried, and taken from place to place, turned and touched by
   everyone, it might effect their cure. Let this example, my dear Sister,
   be that which you propose to follow during your novitiate; and it is by
   becoming like this little Child that you will merit to enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIV.--On Reserve with a Director.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On a difficulty in and a dislike
   to opening one's mind to a director.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Believe me, my dear Sister, it is necessary to struggle with all your
   power against the repugnance you feel to open your mind, and to regard
   as a most dangerous temptation the jealous susceptibility you
   experience when you imagine that someone has revealed your fault. It is
   the devil who inspires such fear and pain at having your interior
   miseries made known, because he knows by countless experiences that
   those souls that have sufficient courage and humility to disclose
   themselves thus, simply and straightforwardly, are speedily cured, or
   at least very greatly consoled. He knows, too, that those wounds of the
   soul most frequently healed by such a disclosure, can become poisoned
   and inflamed if not shown to the physician. In fact nothing is more
   evident than that, as long as we are full of self-love, which only dies
   when we die, we shall be exposed to deceive ourselves as to what
   concerns us, and to make to ourselves a false conscience. This
   consideration is calculated to make us tremble, whoever we are. To
   avoid this danger there is only one means; not to trust to our own
   light in what regards ourselves, but to allow our directors to guide
   our conscience, and to them we must make known with great frankness all
   that might serve to enlighten them. The misfortune is that even in
   these revelations we risk being deceived by our self-love, and also to
   mislead those of whom we ask advice. What is to be done to guarantee
   ourselves against this fresh danger? Well! those who guide us must be
   enlightened by others about us; and this is just what is so difficult
   to put up with. There are plenty of people very much inclined to
   exercise zeal with regard to others, who find it very unpleasant when
   they are subject to it themselves. This ought not to be. True zeal
   should say to itself "Think of yourself, and do not trouble about
   others who are not under your care, and be very thankful that some
   charitable person has made known to your director what is thought about
   you, so that he will be better able to guide you in future." This
   two-fold feeling is only to be found in the most perfect souls, and,
   perhaps, in some persons of an extraordinary natural sincerity if but
   of moderate virtue. Usually a zeal for instructing others is
   accompanied by a great sensitiveness with regard to the persons who
   desire to render us the same good office by instructing our director
   thoroughly as to what is thought and said about us. Here again we have
   that two-fold illusion of all ordinary devotees in the world, and also
   in the cloister. Examine yourself without any flattery as to this
   two-fold matter, and enlighten yourself with the considerations I have
   just given you.

  Letter XIV.--On Discouragement.

   To the same person. On discouragement.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   At this moment you are suffering from one of the most dangerous
   temptations that could assail any soul of good will; the temptation to
   discouragement. I conjure you to resist it with all your might. Have
   confidence in God, and be convinced that He will finish the work He has
   begun in you. Your foolish fears about the future come from the devil.
   Think only of the present, abandon the future to Providence. It is the
   good use of the present that assures the future. Apply yourself to
   obtaining attachment and conformity to the will of God in all things
   and everywhere, even to the smallest things, for in this consist all
   virtue and perfection. For the rest, God only allows our daily faults
   to keep us humble. If you know how to gain this fruit, and to remain in
   peace and confidence, then you will be in a better state than if you
   had not committed any apparent fault, which would only have greatly
   flattered your self-love, and have exposed you to the extreme danger of
   being satisfied with yourself. Nothing, on the contrary, can be more
   easy than to make use of your faults to acquire a fresh degree of
   humility, and thus to dig more deeply in yourself the foundation
   necessary for building up true sanctity. Ought we not to admire, and to
   bless the infinite goodness of God who knows how to make our very
   faults serve for our greater good? For this it suffices to dislike
   them, to humble ourselves quietly about them, and to raise ourselves
   again with an untiring perseverance after each fall, and to work
   peacefully to correct ourselves. Submit to the will of God as to your
   employments, but do not be uneasy or eager about them. Do amiably all
   that you know you ought to do, and depend on divine Providence for
   success, without solicitude or anxiety, in order to have a free mind
   and a tranquil heart in so far as it is possible. If you are faithful
   in this practice, you will be able to live in peace even in the midst
   of disturbances, and the involuntary trouble these may occasion you
   will but increase the merit that is grounded on the conformity of your
   will to the will of God. May He be blessed by all and in all, now and
   for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVI.--Fear of Singularity.

   To the same person. On the fear of being deceived, and of appearing
   singular.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When one begins to wish to belong to God entirely and unreservedly, He
   increases, by the interior operations of His grace this holy desire
   which He has Himself inspired; but the more vehement this desire
   becomes, the more does the soul feel seized and penetrated with fear
   lest it should be deceived. This fear is a fresh gift of God, and
   provided the soul knows how to make good use of it, she will derive
   great benefit, become more humble, more self-distrustful, vigilant, and
   eager to obtain the help of God. But precisely because it is a gift of
   God, the spirit of darkness does not fail to make use of his ordinary
   tactics, and if he cannot prevent these gifts of God, he sets to work
   to spoil and corrupt them by every kind of stratagem. This is what he
   does with regard to the salutary fear of which I speak; and for this he
   makes use of two kinds of deception. At first he attempts to make this
   fear immoderate, excessive, uneasy and vexatious, to unsettle and
   weaken the soul, and having effected this, to cast it into a state of
   pusillanimity, and depression. For this, the only remedy is, to turn
   the laugh against the tempter, and to address him thus: "He who has
   begun the work will finish it, and since of His own goodness He has
   chosen me even when I shunned Him, He will take care not to abandon me
   when I seek Him with my whole heart." Remember, besides, that a good
   beginning is the best guarantee of perseverance. It is very much easier
   to continue in the same way than to change it. There never would have
   been any conversions if attention had been paid to foolish fears. These
   are the first temptations of beginners. But, another and more dangerous
   stratagem still is this; the tempter seeks accomplices, and too
   frequently finds them amongst good people. In the way of our good
   resolutions he throws people not wanting in a sort of wisdom, nor in
   good intention, who find something to carp at in everything that grace
   inspires in our souls to take them out of the ordinary groove. To
   listen to these counsellors, who are the more eager to offer their
   advice the less they are asked for it, one would think that to aim at
   perfection is to make yourself remarkable in a dreadful way.

   We ought never, say they, to exaggerate, nor to undertake a course of
   life contrary to nature; what is out of the common never lasts, and
   exaggeration is blamable in everything. I do not hesitate to say that
   this is one of the greatest obstacles to divine grace that souls called
   to perfection can encounter. It is human respect in the cloister, which
   in its way, is as dangerous as that in the world, and no less prevents
   the conversion of souls from imperfection to sanctity, than the latter
   prevents the conversion from bad to good.

   By what means can these dangers be avoided? By these. We must overcome,
   courageously, for the love of Jesus Christ, the impressions made on us
   by a false human respect, and make a generous sacrifice of them to our
   Lord, begging Him to help and sustain us that we may despise all these
   foolish remarks. It is enough to compare the maxims of the Gospel with
   the captious sophisms to which they are opposed, to convince ourselves
   that they cannot possibly proceed from the Spirit of God but only from
   human reasons, and that carnal spirit which is reprobated by God. "But
   those who talk like this are pious people." That may be, but it only
   proves that some pious people do not always judge things by the pure
   light of the Gospel, but allow themselves to be deceived by false
   prejudices, and natural considerations, by interested self-love, error,
   blindness, or ignorance. They must, in fact, of necessity, be very
   ignorant and very blind not to perceive that there never has been a
   true conversion nor real change of heart that escaped notice either in
   the world or in religion. And why are these conversions noticeable when
   they are real? It is because they, necessarily, extend to the
   regulation of outward conduct, and even if there were nothing in the
   outward conduct that required regulating, the perfect order and
   heavenly peace restore to the soul would be manifested by infallible
   signs by which the good would be edified, but which, perhaps, would
   irritate the jealous self-love of others. One must needs be voluntarily
   blind not to see that at the beginning of a new life one's conduct may
   seem constrained and uneasy, for this reason; because neither the
   person who is changed, nor others, are accustomed to an altered way of
   acting. In all things ease comes with habitude. Besides, how can a soul
   which is entirely employed in keeping recollected, in fighting against
   itself, in compelling itself to do violence in a hundred different
   ways, both interior and exterior, be expected to appear gay, free,
   happy, agreeable, and amusing? Truly, if I saw it like this I should
   have strong doubts as to any interior change whatever. However there
   are some people who are very interior, and at the same time appear very
   gracious outwardly. This is when a sufficiently long experience has
   made the exercise of interior recollection, in a sort of way, natural
   to them. But when they began they were just like you, my dear Sister,
   and the same things that are said of you, were said of them. They went
   their way without taking any notice of the talk, and God at last placed
   them in a state that is called the liberty of the children of God. Like
   them you also will attain to this, be assured: the day will come when
   your recollection will be without compulsion, constant, sweet,
   agreeable and good-humoured; then you also will be able to add to the
   pleasure of others by reflecting exteriorly that abounding peace and
   joy which is caused in the soul by the pure love of God, and of your
   neighbour. But no one can arrive at this suddenly, or at once; it is
   the result of a sufficiently long practice of virtue and of an interior
   life, which, at the beginning, seems of necessity uncomfortable and
   rather constrained; but in the end it will become natural. Then you
   will be able to resume your light-heartedness and gaiety, for both will
   be reformed and spiritualised by the holy operations of grace. In the
   beginning, however, it is impossible to do this without spoiling
   something.

   You see the ignorance of these clever reasoners? Their judgments and
   remarks are to be pitied because it is precisely in this way that the
   world judges and reasons when God by His grace effects one of those
   great changes that are visible to all. Can it be possible that
   Religious talk in this way? It must be the work of the father of lies,
   who alone could make them speak and reason in such a wrong way. God be
   praised in all things! He will procure glory from it in some way or
   other. As for you, think only of bearing this trial bravely, and
   encourage yourself with the teaching of faith and the evangelical
   counsels which these grand reasoners seem to have lost sight of.
   Rejoice interiorly at this appearance of folly and stupidity which
   exposes you to their mockery; for it is a most sure sign of the change
   that has taken place in you. Say to our Lord with the Psalmist: "I am
   become like a beast of burden in Your presence, Oh my God; no one can
   separate me from You again." In the service of so great a Master can
   any position be without honour? Act the part that He has given you at
   present, of seeming silly and awkward, as well as you can, and with a
   joyful heart wait patiently for the moment when another change will
   take place quite different to that which you are going through now.
   Then your faculties which now seem in bonds will regain their freedom
   of action; ease will succeed restraint and the holy liberty of the
   children of God will drive away excessive fear. The sight of the
   imperfection of all your works is a great grace of God Who by this,
   wishes to keep you humble, and with a poor opinion of yourself, but the
   excessive severity you are tempted to exercise towards yourself about
   it, the sadness, low spirits, and the idea that you will be lost, are
   suggestions of Satan who tries in this way to spoil the gift of God in
   you, and to turn it into poison. Cast them away therefore as diabolical
   imaginations. For a certain time such thoughts will return again and
   again without ceasing and will be matter for combats, for victories,
   and for merit; but, have a little patience, perfection is not the work
   of a day. At first do not attempt what is the most perfect; that would
   be trying to fly before you have got your wings, as St. Teresa says. Be
   content with what God gives you, and what He does for you at present,
   without desiring anything more until He judges fit to give it to you.
   In this way you will avoid interior agitation by which the devil
   succeeds too well in upsetting those souls who seek in the practice of
   virtue, more the satisfaction of their own self-love than the glory of
   God. In fact, it is impossible not to recognise the vexation of injured
   pride in the impatience with which they behold their imperfections and
   in the pain they feel in finding themselves at the foot of the ladder
   of sanctity when they wished to persuade themselves that they had
   arrived at the top. Do you, Sister, behave in a totally different
   manner. Love your abjection, allow the good God to carry out peacefully
   His work in you. Allow Him to place there a solid foundation of
   humility, and to cement it with frequent experiences of your misery and
   weakness. We should run too great a risk of losing everything by our
   vain imaginations if God were to give us, at once, all the perfection
   we desired. The inordinate love of our own excellence would carry us to
   as high a flight as Lucifer, but only like him, to fall into the abyss
   of pride. God, who knows our weakness in this respect, allows us to
   grovel like worms in the mud of our imperfections, until He finds us
   capable of being raised without feeling any foolish self-satisfaction,
   or any contempt of others.

   This conduct of God, full of wisdom and goodness, fills with admiration
   those who have the guidance of souls, but they cannot help feeling sad
   when they see souls who refuse to understand the object of these
   merciful trials, getting out of temper when the ineffable ways of
   divine Providence are explained to them.

    THE FIRST TRIALS OF SOULS CALLED TO THE STATE OF ABANDONMENT.

    ARIDITIES, WEAKNESSES AND WEARINESS.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter I.--Aridity and Weakness.

   There is reason to think that this letter was addressed by Fr. de
   Caussade to Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil, who, to enable her holy
   director to understand her better, had given him an account of her
   vocation, and of her spiritual state from the time she had embraced the
   religious life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   On the trials above-mentioned. General direction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   God has indeed granted you what you told me you had asked of Him, my
   dear Sister; for, in reading your letter I seemed to be reading your
   soul, and it appeared to me that I understood your spiritual state as
   well as if I had been your confessor and director for a long time. Oh!
   what consoling and instructive things I have to tell you! I hope that
   the Holy Spirit will enable you to understand and to enjoy them; and
   that God will deign by the merits of Jesus Christ, and the intercession
   of His most Holy Mother, of St. Joseph, St. Francis of Sales, and of
   all the saints of your Order who are now in Heaven, to grant them His
   holy blessing.

   1st. Your vocation seems to me to have the marks of the seal of God; I
   see in it manifest signs of His divine will, proofs of His gratuitous
   predilection of your soul, and a solid guarantee of your eternal
   predestination.

   2nd. The attraction you feel to give yourself entirely to Him, and live
   a wholly interior life in spite of the dissipation of your mind, and
   the rebellion of nature, is a grace the value of which I would that it
   pleased God to show you as He has me. It is all the more real in being
   less accessible to the senses and more completely hidden under contrary
   appearances.

   3rd. Why is it, then, that in spite of this attraction, and of all your
   pious reading, you seem to remain always at the entrance of the
   interior life without the power of entering? I will tell you the
   reason, my dear Sister, for I see it very distinctly; it is because you
   have misused this attraction by inordinate desires, by over-eagerness,
   and a natural activity, thus displeasing God, and stifling the gentle
   action of grace. Also, because in your conduct there has been a secret
   and imperceptible presumption which has made you rely on your own
   industry, and your own efforts. God wishes to humiliate and to confound
   you by your own experiences, and in this way to moderate that natural
   ardour that carries you beyond the impressions of grace. Without
   noticing it you have acted as if you aspired to do all the work by your
   own industry, and even to do more than God desired. You who would have
   taken yourself to task for any worldly ambition, have, without scruple,
   allowed yourself to be carried away by a still more subtle ambition,
   and by a desire for a high position in the spiritual life. But, be
   comforted; thanks to the merciful severity of God's dealings with you,
   so far there is nothing lost; on the contrary you have gained greatly.
   God punished you for these imperfections like a good father, with
   tenderness; and enables you to find a remedy for the evil in the
   chastisement He inflicts on you. To avenge these infidelities He sends
   you the sort of trials He is accustomed to make use of to purify and
   detach those chosen souls called to pure love and divine union.

   If you understood this fatherly conduct in your regard, and looked at
   your trials from the right point of view all your fears would disappear
   of their own accord. You would not be surprised, for example, that your
   aridity and interior trouble have increased since you entered religion.
   I am not by any means surprised, and should have been very sorry on
   your account had it been otherwise. Has it not been since then, in
   fact, that you have belonged more entirely to God, and that this divine
   Spouse has laboured more energetically to purify your soul, and to
   render it capable of being perfectly united to Him?

   4th. As for that state of dissipation of which you complain so much, I
   agree with you in thinking that it is partly the result of your natural
   character, of the liveliness of your imagination and above all, of
   habit. However, God has only allowed this result to humble and confound
   you more completely; and the keen pain you suffer is not the least part
   of the merit of this trial. You see I am very far from believing, as
   you do, that there is no remedy for this evil or that it is caused by
   some secret sins.

   The fear that this dissipation of mind causes you when you go to
   prayer, is a temptation, or else simply imagination, and God gives you
   a great grace in giving you courage to take no notice of it, but to
   approach Him with confidence in spite of this misleading fear.

   5th. In your distaste for your outward occupations and duties I see
   only another side of your trials and one which can be very meritorious
   in the sight of God provided that you overcome it instead of allowing
   yourself to be overcome by it.

   The acts that you make in opposition to this feeling, and of sacrifice
   and self-abnegation are very solid and very good. The merit of these
   acts is much increased by the renewal of the interior rebellions by
   which you are crucified; this is another part of the trial.

   6th. That which you add about your powerlessness and apparent idleness
   in prayer, is a consequence of this trial, and naturally follows it; I
   should have been greatly surprised had it been otherwise.

   Be reassured, therefore, for you will have to continue to waste your
   time in prayer, my dear Sister, and although you might do it more
   quietly, and this, please God, you will eventually achieve, you will
   never make any prayer that would be better, more useful, or more
   meritorious; because the prayer of abnegation and suffering being more
   crucifying is also more purifying for the soul, and makes it die to
   self more quickly in order to live henceforth in God and for God. Oh!
   how much I love such prayer during which you stand before God like a
   beast of burden feeling nothing and bowed down under the weight of all
   sorts of temptations! What could be more calculated to humble,
   confound, and annihilate a soul before God? This is what the soul
   requires, and to what its apparent miseries lead. Ah! if you only knew
   how to remain with respect and submission in this humiliating
   condition, abandoning yourself so entirely to the divine will as to
   take pleasure in your abjection and annihilation for the love of God,
   you would become much more pleasing to Him in your inaction and silence
   than by making the most explicit and energetic acts! No! there is no
   sacrifice more acceptable to God than a broken and humble heart, this
   is truly a holocaust full of sweet odours. Prayers that are full of
   fervour and devotion, or voluntary mortifications, bear no comparison
   because they cannot come near it.

   7th. Your terrors about confession and communion are to be rejected and
   despised as temptations and imaginations; they are another part of your
   trial. However, should they continue to trouble you, in spite of your
   resistance, take no notice, and be patient in this state as in other
   things. As to the wish to get rid of this trying state, it is not the
   direct, but the natural result of the trial, and the effect of self
   love which cries out, and struggles rebelliously when it finds itself
   on the point of being pitilessly exterminated. You must not be daunted,
   nor terrified, but struggle bravely with your free-will against these
   desires, and persevere with an unshaken constancy in choosing always to
   accomplish the holy will of God. This point is of the first importance,
   not only to gather the fruit of the trial, but also to soften its
   bitterness and to shorten its duration. If, in your case, it has lasted
   a long time, I have grounds for attributing this to the fact that you
   have not had sufficient courage to make the entire sacrifice that God
   demanded of you. Hasten then to make it, and say to Him, "Yes, my God,
   I accept all, I submit to all without reserve, and for as long as You
   please."
     __________________________________________________________________

   From all I have just said you will conclude without difficulty that
   there is but one thing for you to do, which is to let God dispose of
   you as He pleases, and to keep yourself quietly and interiorly tranquil
   as far as you can, but nevertheless without effort. Abandonment to God
   is for you just now the one thing necessary. To effect this thoroughly
   I give you the following rules:

   1st. When you go to prayer you must be resigned to suffer at it, to be
   tormented and afflicted exactly as God pleases. When distractions,
   aridity, temptations, and weariness overwhelm you, say, "You are
   welcome, Cross of my God; I embrace you with a resigned will; made me
   suffer until my self-love becomes crucified and dead." Then remain in
   God's presence like a beast of burden weighed down with its load, and
   almost ready to perish, but expecting succour and help from its Master.
   If you could but throw yourself in spirit at the foot of the Cross of
   Jesus Christ, humbly kiss His sacred wounds, and remain there at His
   divine feet steadfast and motionless, and do nothing else but wait
   patiently in silence and peace as a poor beggar waits for hours at a
   time at the gates of a great king, or of a generous and rich
   benefactor, hoping to receive an alms. But before all things do not
   dream of making any more efforts, either in prayer, or in anything
   else, trying to be more recollected than God wishes you to be.

   2nd. Do not therefore, make any violent efforts to preserve
   recollection during the day, or to drive away the continual
   distractions that make you uneasy; be satisfied to know that this state
   of dissipation displeases you, and that you have a great desire to be
   recollected; but only when it pleases God, and as much as it pleases
   Him, neither more nor less.

   3rd. If the dissipation of mind should sometimes be so trying, and the
   aridity, troubles, fears, and other vexatious feelings so overwhelming
   that you cannot make a single interior act, nor even entertain a good
   thought, do not be cast down. You have nothing to fear, but rather,
   much to gain if, in this deplorable condition you understand how to
   remain in the simple interior silence of respect, submission, and
   adoration of which I have already spoken, and to bury yourself in the
   abyss of your own nothingness. This nothingness, accepted and loved for
   the love of God, is your safe refuge in the midst of these storms. It
   is there that you must remain, and it is from thence that you must take
   pleasure in beholding the fulfilment within you of the will of God. You
   must love to see Him, in imagination, raining down from the heights of
   Heaven, distractions, aridity, fears, anguish, and every species of
   trouble and humiliation on your soul; as if He would make of you the
   plaything of His pleasure and of His divine love; just as one sees
   sometimes, how great princes will amuse themselves with splashing one
   of their favourites with mud.

   4th. As to the sacraments take good care never to omit receiving them.
   "But," you say to me, "how can I prepare for confession and communion
   when my mind is obsessed with all sorts of fears and difficulties?" You
   must despise them, take no notice, and go straight to God without ever
   disputing or reasoning with them either for or against, and having done
   the little you could, or knew how to do, quietly, and without effort,
   remain tranquil in the perfect interior silence of faith, respect,
   submission and confidence often saying, but without words: "May my
   sovereign Lord and Master do with me whatever He pleases. Amen! Amen!"

   5th. As in all that you tell me there is no sin, or at any rate,
   nothing voluntary although it often seems otherwise to you, keep
   yourself in a constant state of calmness and tranquillity. I do not
   speak of the lower part of the soul, which is all in trouble and
   desolation: but of the superior part, of that profound depth of your
   soul, which, with God's help, can remain tranquil and peaceful in the
   midst of these storms and commotions. Agitation is, so to speak, only
   outside the soul in the exterior senses, to mortify them and cause them
   to die, as they must in order to be able to attain to pure love and
   union with God. It is for you to prevent this trouble from penetrating
   to the interior; and it is in this, that, up to now, you have not been
   sufficiently enlightened, nor faithful enough.

   6th. In fact, although I can discover no particular sin in your
   conduct, yet I perceive a whole host of defects and imperfections in it
   which might do you great harm if you did not apply a strong remedy.
   These are uneasiness, foolish fears, depression, weariness, and a
   discouragement not quite free from deliberation, or at least not
   combated with sufficient energy, all of which tend to diminish that
   interior peace the necessity for which I am endeavouring to inculcate.
   "But what can I do to prevent them?" This: first, never retain them
   wilfully; secondly, never parley with them, nor yet combat them with
   effort, or violence, because that would make them doubly hurtful; but
   drop them, like one drops a stone into the water; think of something
   else, speak to God of other things, as St. Francis of Sales advises,
   then take refuge in the interior silence of respect, submission,
   confidence, and a total abandonment. "But," you say, supposing that in
   these, or in other matters I commit faults, how ought I to behave?"
   Well! then you must bear in mind the advice of St. Francis of Sales; do
   not trouble yourself about your troubles, do not be uneasy about your
   uneasiness, do not be discouraged because you are discouraged, but
   return immediately to God without violence but humbling yourself
   quietly and tranquilly, even thanking Him for having prevented you from
   falling into greater faults. This sweet and gentle humility united to
   confidence in the divine goodness will tranquillize and pacify your
   soul, and this is, at present, your greatest spiritual need. I forgot
   to tell you that your great desire of divine love in spite of what you
   undergo afterwards, is certainly not an imagination, nor a chimera, on
   the contrary it is very real, very solid and most excellent, and must
   be preserved, but quietly and gently without giving way to those
   feelings of fervour, to those transports of the imagination, or to that
   natural activity that spoils everything. That which you experience,
   after having been all on fire with these ardent desires, when you try
   to return to yourself, need not surprise you. I will try and make clear
   by a comparison what then takes place within you. When you throw a very
   dry piece of wood that will burn easily, on the fire, the flame seizes
   it at once and consumes it quietly and noiselessly; but if you throw
   green wood on the fire the flame does not affect it except for a
   moment, and then the heat of the fire acting on the green wet wood
   makes it exude moisture and emit sighing sounds, and twists and turns
   it in a hundred different ways with great noise, until it has been made
   dry enough for the fire to take hold of it; then the flame spreads and
   consumes it without any effort or noise, but quietly.

   This is an image of the action of divine love on souls that are still
   full of imperfections and the evil inclinations of self-love. These
   must be purified, refined, and cleared away and this cannot be achieved
   without trouble and suffering. Look upon yourself then, as this green
   wood acted on by divine love before it is able to enkindle it, and to
   consume it with its flames. Or else as a statue under the hands of a
   sculptor, or like a stone which is chipped and cut with the chisel and
   hammer to make it the right shape to take its place in a beautiful
   building. If this stone could feel, and if, while it thus suffered it
   asked you what it should do in so much pain, you would, without doubt,
   reply, "Keep perfectly quiet in the hands of the workman and let him
   proceed with his work, otherwise you will always remain a rough common
   piece of stone." Take this advice yourself, have patience and let God
   do the work because there is really nothing else for you to do, only
   say, "I adore and I submit. Fiat!"

  Letter II.--Different States of the Soul.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On interior vicissitudes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   The different states that you depict in your letter to me are nothing
   more than interior vicissitudes to which we are all subject. These
   perpetual alternations of light and darkness, of consolation and
   desolation, are as useful, I should say, as indispensable for the
   growth and ripening of virtue in our souls, as the atmospheric changes
   are necessary for the growth and ripening of the harvests. Let us
   learn, therefore, to resign ourselves to them, and to accept with equal
   love trials and consolations, for all trials, even the most painful are
   equally just, holy and beneficial, whether they proceed from the
   justice, or the mercy of God. Often they are sent to us both by justice
   and mercy, but while we are on earth justice is never exercised without
   mercy. I am delighted to hear that your usual occupation during prayer
   is the contemplation of your weakness, and the realisation of your
   nothingness; this is the way to acquire, by degrees, an entire distrust
   of self, and a perfect confidence in God only; also in this way you
   will become perfectly grounded in interior humility, which is the firm
   and solid foundation of the spiritual edifice, and the principal source
   of all the graces of God in the soul. You need neither be surprised nor
   pained at the destruction of all that is dear to self-love; it would
   not be self-love if it did not fear this. Only those souls that are
   already detached from self are free from the fear of this death; and
   not only do they not fear it, but they desire and beg it of God without
   ceasing. For us it is enough if we endure in peace, and with patience
   the successive blows that are effecting it. It often happens that
   during the day we experience certain feelings and desires for God or
   divine things, which do not occur during prayer. God arranges it thus
   so that we may recognise that He is absolute Master of all His gifts
   and graces; that He bestows them when and where it pleases Him. In
   receiving them thus, at times when we least expect them and in being
   disappointed at other times when we expect them, we shall no longer be
   able to persuade ourselves that they are the result of our own
   disposition, work, or industry; this is what God intends to prove to
   us. Therefore if He is prodigal of His gifts He expects to receive all
   the glory of them, and would be compelled to withdraw them if He found
   that we appropriated any part of them through self-satisfaction.

  Letter III.--Abandonment During Trials.

   To Mlle. de Serre who afterwards became Sister Catharine Angélique. On
   the same subject. Abandonment during trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Keep steadfast my dear daughter, in the midst of your violent interior
   afflictions, and never relinquish the practice of entire abandonment to
   God, and of perfect confidence in His goodness. Encourage yourself with
   these two obvious and invariable principles: first, that God will never
   abandon any who have abandoned themselves entirely to Him, and who
   trust completely in His infinite mercy. Secondly, that nothing happens
   in this world that is not according to the decrees of Providence who
   turns all things to the advantage and greater profit of souls that are
   submissive and resigned. Contrary thoughts and interior combats will
   only serve, if you remain faithful, to strengthen in your mind, and to
   root more firmly in your heart, the truths and feelings so necessary
   for your sanctification. The perfection of the state to which God calls
   you is, no doubt, beyond your power to attain, neither can you depend
   on yourself in the very slightest degree for its attainment; on the
   contrary you must beware of doing so, and rely on God only, grounding
   yourself on His succour and the power of His grace, with the help of
   which so many others weaker than yourself have been able, and are still
   able to do what seems to you so difficult. You ought, therefore, to
   repeat continually, "Yes! considering my weakness and misery, this
   would be as impossible as flying in the air. But that which is
   impossible to man becomes possible, pleasant and easy with the
   assistance of the all-powerful grace of Jesus Christ, and I hope to
   obtain this grace from His goodness, and through His infinite merits."
   In this way have many young people, who were naturally feeble and
   timid, triumphed over cruel tyrants, and braved the most terrible
   sufferings and outrages and shed their blood in imitation and love of a
   crucified God.

   The weariness, distaste, and dryness from which you frequently suffer
   are the usual vicissitudes through which all those souls, aiming at
   union with God, are accustomed to pass. What merit should we gain, and
   how should we prove our fidelity to God if we were always supported,
   helped, and consoled in a sensible manner by interior grace? What is
   essential is to be faithful in the fulfilment of all our duties, and of
   those interior and exterior practices that belong to our state, as much
   during dryness and distaste as in sweetness and sensible devotion.
   Although then we do nothing without effort and repugnance, the merit is
   none the less great. In this way only is our love of God completely
   free from that unhappy self-love which thrusts itself everywhere, mixes
   with everything, and spoils everything, as St. Francis of Sales says.
   As there is a sweet and delightful peace to be felt during prayer, so
   also is there a dry, bitter, and sometimes a suffering peace by which
   God operates more freely in the soul than by the former which is more
   subject to the inroads of self-love. Therefore one must abandon oneself
   to God in this as in all other things. We must allow Him to work,
   because He knows better than we do what is good for us. Let us fear
   only one thing, and that is to allow our self-will to lead us astray.
   To avoid this danger it only needs to will exactly what God wills,
   always, at every moment and for everything. This is the safest, the
   shortest, I even dare to say the only road to perfection; any other is
   subject to illusion, pride and self-love. For the rest, drop gradually
   but quietly the lengthy reasonings which absorb your mind during
   prayer, and aim, rather, at affections, aspirations, desires for God,
   and a simple repose in Him. This will not prevent you, however, from
   pausing a little over good thoughts, if they are simple, quiet and
   peaceful, and seem to come and go of their own accord.

  Letter IV.--Darkness and Doubts.

   To a Postulant. On obscurity and weakness.

   Note: "This Postulant is Madame de Lesen, about whom Rev. Mother
   Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen had consulted Fr. de Caussade, and had
   undertaken to place in direct communication with him. She entered the
   Convent of the Annunciation at St. Mihiel."
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   All that you describe to me in your letter appears to me so easy to
   decide, that God must have kept you in very great darkness if you have
   not been able, with the help of His grace, to find a clue for yourself.
   Besides, as you tell me, God does, occasionally, send you some rays of
   light to illuminate your soul, and disperse the darkness of your
   doubts. These gleams of light which enkindle your heart, filling it
   with a sweet peace and great courage in the service of God, can come
   only from Heaven. Therefore you can follow these lights without fear,
   and the recollection of them will suffice to sustain and guide you in
   moments of darkness. However, since God has inspired you to apply to me
   again, it will be quite easy to satisfy you in each particular.

   1st. The snares and subtleties of self-love render you, you say,
   incapable of seeing things in their proper light. Then why do you
   attempt to do so? Have you not, in holy obedience, an infallible guide,
   and in humility and docility sure guarantees that you are not misled in
   following the decisions laid down for you.

   2nd. After having consulted your Superior or your Mistress with the
   simplicity of a little child, remain in peace, for this is your
   security. If you do not submit to this rule, you will be much to be
   pitied, and it will be your own fault.

   3rd. To feel so keenly your weakness, and need of sensible support, and
   as it were, always on the edge of a precipice is, in truth, a very
   humiliating trial, but a very salutary one, since it leads infallibly
   to a total distrust of self, and to the most perfect confidence in God.
   This is the only way to leave the region of the senses, and to enter
   the life of pure faith and love which is wholly spiritual.

   4th. The dark dungeon in which you find yourself is a prison into
   which, I will not say the justice of God, but His very great mercy
   throws you from time to time to purify you like gold in a crucible. You
   have only to stay there as quietly as you can. "But how then shall I
   practise virtue?" In this case virtue consists in suffering, in silent
   endurance and abandonment, and in humble and loving submission. You
   know the great maxim that more progress is made during suffering than
   in action. "But," you will say, "I commit sin while in this state." No,
   there is no sin, the Master of the prison will prevent that. "But it
   seems to me that I look upon hell with indifference." This is a strong
   way of expressing yourself, but, thank God, I can understand the
   meaning of it better than you do. It only expresses the result of that
   interior operation by which God weakens your self-love. Take courage,
   the day will come, and perhaps soon, when you will be able to realise
   the great good effected in this dark prison; for the present you must
   live in this hope without other light than that of faith.

   5th. No doubt, there occur, in your state of interior fever, paroxysms
   which seem to devour and consume you. These are caused by what is
   impure and earthly in the depths of the soul, which is thus consumed
   and devoured, like the evil humours of the body during the paroxysms of
   certain fevers. This is a symptom of cure not of illness. "But at these
   times I can neither pray, nor have recourse to God." No, perhaps not,
   at any rate not in a perceptible manner; but the heart prays without
   ceasing by hidden desires known only to God. Your conclusion really
   made me laugh; "judge therefore," you say, "how I acquit myself of the
   obligation of reciting the Office, assisting at Mass and the rest."
   Very willingly, my dear Sister, would I take upon myself all the evil
   you commit in these circumstances, if you would concede me all the good
   that God is effecting in you. That little word, "therefore," has given
   me an insight into a certain temptation which the subtlety of the evil
   spirit tries to introduce into your soul. But let us follow your
   letter, and the thread of my reply. You begin to think, say you, that
   you were very rash in making a vow to become a Religious, and that the
   observances of the religious life are far beyond your powers. If I had
   not had a long experience of the progress made by even the most
   manifest temptations, when they are given the least encouragement under
   pretext of examining them, I should never have imagined you capable of
   succumbing so foolishly to this one. To cut it short I must tell you
   firstly, that I knew by the drift of your letter that this was the
   temptation the devil aimed at by all the changes he has rung in your
   soul. If he can only make you relinquish your prize, what a victory he
   will gain! what a triumph for all hell! Secondly, I forbid you in the
   Name of God and by all the authority He has given me over you, either
   to listen to, or examine into this subject in any way; and I command
   you to act about it in the same way as if the devil suggested that you
   should throw yourself into a well or poison all the Religious. Thirdly,
   God wills you to embrace the religious life; this then ought to take
   place, and will take place in spite of all hell let loose to prevent
   it. "But the spiritual afflictions! the bodily infirmities!" If
   necessary God will perform miracles about them, and you must expect
   these miracles when they are required. Now humble yourself, my dear
   Sister, annihilate yourself profoundly before God, confess to Him that
   you are weakness and inconstancy itself. This experience should serve
   for the future to make you feel how necessary it is to distrust self in
   our boasted courage and apparent firmness in good resolutions which
   come to nothing without God's ceaseless support. How poor, weak and
   miserable beyond all expression are we not, and liable to go wrong in
   every imaginable way, and in things we should never have thought
   possible!

   6th. The sensitiveness you feel when being corrected, in this state of
   trouble, ought to be a subject of humiliation, but not of
   discouragement; because it is true that at such times sensitiveness is
   so keen that St. Teresa herself was obliged to be on her guard against
   a spiteful and fretful temper which she was tempted to vent on the
   Sisters. It would take too long to tell you the great good God produces
   in our souls by these feelings and rebellions, provided they are borne
   patiently.

   7th. God makes you feel that Satan is laying traps for you, and that,
   at the same time His invisible hand bears you up, and holds you back;
   what could be more encouraging? Keep firm, all this will turn to your
   very great good, and above all will serve to make you thoroughly
   convinced of your own weakness which you have never hitherto understood
   such as it is. You require all these temptations and trials to convince
   you of it, and to tear from your heart every fibre of foolish
   self-confidence. It is only when we begin to be cured that we recognize
   the evil.

   I finish by repeating that your state, although, in truth, very
   crucifying, is nevertheless, and indeed on that account, very safe,
   very purifying and very sanctifying. You need fear no danger, as long
   as you hold by Fénélon's great rule: despair entirely of yourself, and
   put not an atom of confidence in anything but God alone, Who, from the
   very stones can raise up children to Abraham.

  Letter V.--Distractions in Prayer.

   To Sister Marie-Henriette de Bousmard. On weakness and distractions
   (1734).
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. Do not regret the consolations and sensible devotion that God gave
   you formerly, and has now taken away. With the consolations that you
   experienced were mingled a thousand imperfections. It is true that by
   the very fact that these consolations were felt they were extremely
   pleasant to nature which always desires to see, know, and feel; but the
   more according to nature is the state, the less is it adapted for the
   requirements of divine love. This is the reason that God quickly
   withdraws a soul from this state; and the more quickly, the more
   faithfully it responds to His grace. If He did not act towards us, in
   this respect, with a fatherly strictness, we should always remain
   feeble, subject to all sorts of defects, and incapable of protecting
   ourselves against the allurements and illusions of self-love. The soul
   that has not been enlightened and set free by trials, indulges, almost
   without perceiving it, in continual self-examinations, and makes its
   satisfaction and peace depend on feelings, the most unstable things in
   the world; if it loves God, it is not only for Himself but much more on
   account of the consolations it expects from Him, and it remains in a
   vain self-satisfaction occasioned by the spiritual riches it supposes
   itself to possess, and God grant that it may not end by worshipping its
   own imaginary excellence. However, even if the soul avoids this
   criminal excess, it is to be greatly feared, that being full of itself
   it remains empty of God. Rather than expose the souls that He loves
   with a love of predilection to such a fearful misfortune, God sends
   them all sorts of trials. He strikes them, humiliates them and makes
   them contemptible in their own eyes. But how superabundantly does He
   not compensate those who remain faithful during trials, for the
   privations they have endured! When, by a complete destruction of one's
   whole spiritual fortune, one finds oneself reduced to nothing, then one
   suddenly discovers that one has neither vanity, presumption, nor
   self-esteem, but is filled with distrust, humility, confidence in God
   and love for Him; and this love is then absolutely pure because
   self-love has nothing to lean upon, and, consequently, nothing to
   become attached to, or to corrupt. Therefore I set more value on your
   present poverty than on all those former beautiful feelings that seemed
   to you so perfectly pure, but of which your self-love secretly made its
   most delicious pasture.

   2nd. It seems, sometimes, as if one had neither faith, hope, nor
   charity, and as if one were without religion, without any virtue, as if
   one had lost all knowledge of God. This happens when He is pleased to
   withdraw all delight, all unction, and all that is sensible to make it
   reside in the essence of the soul, and to enable it to advance by the
   practice of pure faith. Then it is that God is served and adored in
   spirit and in truth, as Jesus Christ said to the woman of Samaria. This
   state is even further removed from the senses, and is, therefore, more
   valuable, higher, more purified and more solid. In it can the pure
   delights of the spirit be enjoyed; but this is only to be attained by
   the privation of all sensible pleasure, a sensible devotion can only be
   enjoyed by the privation of sensual and earthly pleasure. In this
   state, however, there is always peace, because the soul is then
   established in God and feels just as you feel; I mean a secret and
   hidden power proceeding from the inmost presence of God, and this
   support, imperceptible though it is, makes a soul stronger than when it
   believed itself ready to endure martyrdom. So remain in peace, and
   bless God.

   3rd. As for the innumerable acts of offering, resignation, etc.,
   without doubt they are suitable for beginners to form a habit of making
   them; but in your present state they are made by, and in your heart,
   and almost without your thinking of it. Does not God see all your
   intentions, even the most secret, without having them explained to Him
   by what are called formal and express acts? When, in the midst of your
   good works some secret intention of self-love, pride, or human respect
   insinuates itself into your heart, far from making express acts you
   would endeavour to hide from yourself these perverse intentions,
   convinced that God sees, and will punish them; do you not believe then
   that He also sees your secret good intentions and that He is as liberal
   in rewarding as He is strict in punishing?

   4th. The wandering of your thoughts is but another trial from God, an
   occasion of suffering, of humiliation, and an exercise of patience and
   of merit, and the anxiety it causes you is a proof of the desire you
   have of being always occupied with God. Besides, God sees this desire,
   and, in His sight, desires are equal to acts, whether for good or evil.
   Suffer, therefore, humbly and patiently all the involuntary wanderings
   of your mind, and take care not to trouble about them, nor to examine
   anxiously what could have caused them; this would be a simple curiosity
   of self-love which God would punish with still greater darkness.
   Remember what St. Teresa said on this subject, "Let the clapper make a
   noise, provided the mill grinds the corn." She compares the wandering
   mind to the clapper, and the will tending to God to the mill that
   grinds the corn. A will fixed on God is what we should hope for above
   all things. What do you think takes place in the heart of a worldly
   woman during a fine sermon? Doubtless a hundred good thoughts pass
   through her mind and imagination while her will and her heart are fixed
   on the object of her passion; is she any holier for that? With you it
   is exactly the contrary; why then do you distress yourself? Otherwise
   what signifies this tranquillity and peace of the soul in the midst of
   these attacks, these pains, and this torment, and the little desire you
   have to refer to them? Is not this a great gift of God, and an evident
   sign that it is He Who, so delicately, and so peacefully wounds the
   heart? Remain then tranquilly in your state of total abandonment to
   God, and do not trouble yourself to find out how you form acts; they
   are formed by the secret and imperceptible movements of your heart that
   God touches interiorly, and which He moves as He pleases.

   5th. I am not surprised at the fatigue and emptiness you experience in
   making efforts to multiply and reiterate your interior acts. This is
   because in this way you withdraw yourself from the operation of God to
   act for yourself, as if you wanted to anticipate grace and to do more
   than God wished. This is indeed natural activity! Be content to remain
   at peace in your soul, and keep yourself there as in a prison where God
   is pleased to immure you, without bethinking yourself of making
   unseasonable escapes. Thus you will be in that state of holy and
   fruitful idleness that the saints describe, and thus also you will have
   many and great occupations without labour. It is self-love only that
   complains and is in despair at having nothing to do, to see, to feel,
   nor to hear; but let it groan as much as it likes, by dint of worrying
   and despairing it will rid you finally of its presence. By cutting off
   supplies we shall starve it out. Oh! what a fortunate release! I wish
   it for you as for myself with all my heart.

   6th. The way in which you keep in the presence of God by a simple
   glance of faith without mental images, figures, or any kind of
   representation, in a total surrender of your whole self, is the most
   pure and most perfect way of treating with God. It is the true prayer
   of the heart, a quite interior prayer, the sincere prayer of spirit to
   spirit, and the more simple, free, imperceptible, and removed it is,
   from all that can be felt so much the more solid, sublime, penetrating
   and efficacious it becomes, says the holy Mother de Chantal.

  Letter VI.--Fear of Wasting Time.

   To Sister Marie-Henriette de Mahuet. On the same subject, and interior
   rebellion and spiritual poverty. Alby, 1732.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Nothing is more common with souls who have not yet acquired much
   experience in the ways of the spiritual life, than the fear about which
   you have consulted me; I mean the fear of wasting time in the prayer of
   the simple presence of God. But it is easy to reassure such souls, and
   to reassure you also. For this it suffices to recall to your mind the
   principle laid down by the divine Master: "the tree is known by its
   fruits." That which produces only good effects cannot but be good.
   Besides, your own experience teaches you, that since you applied
   yourself to this kind of prayer you have become, interiorly, greatly
   changed for the better. You have, then, only to thank God for the
   favour He has granted you in substituting as He has, the peaceful
   action of His grace for the agitation of your natural activity. I wish
   you could accustom yourself always to judge of your progress and the
   state of your soul by the infallible rules of faith and the counsels of
   the Gospel. When you find that your ways, your ideas, and your conduct
   agree with the teachings of faith, and with the practice of the saints,
   you may hold them to be good, and perfectly safe. In this no illusion
   is possible, as it is when one judges oneself by sensible impressions,
   which are always deceptive. To guide one's conduct by these impressions
   is to take a weathervane, which turns with every wind, for a mariner's
   compass. It is impossible to navigate safely unless guided by the sure
   and infallible rules of faith which make us turn away from sin, love
   God and our neighbour, detach us from creatures, and lead us to
   obedience, self-forgetfulness, complete submission to the will of God,
   abnegation and mortification. The kind of prayer which produces these
   effects is, without doubt, the best.

   2nd. As those spiritual books which treat of prayer might fall into the
   hands of all sorts of persons, and consequently not be well understood,
   authors and preachers do wisely in making use of general terms and in
   laying down only general rules, in order to avoid giving any handle for
   illusion; but directors, in speaking to persons they are well
   acquainted with, make use of a different method to reassure those under
   their direction who, without cause, would be terrified in reading or
   listening to sermons. It is because of my knowledge of your state and
   of God's designs on your behalf that I do not hesitate to reassure you.
   Go forward without a shadow of fear. No one can experience the fruit of
   the blessing of God, unless he follow the attraction of God. The
   deceptions and illusions of the spirit of darkness are made known by
   their effects and fruits which are contrary to those produced by grace.
   If I saw you exposed to these illusions I should not fail to tell you
   of it; and in default of me there are others who would render you this
   service on condition that you laid bare your mind to them with
   sincerity.

   3rd. The rule of faith must be also taken, by which to form a judgment
   about the stupidity you have experienced for some time past. If it be
   only a question of being stupid, dull, and slow, and even insensible to
   all the things of this world, faith teaches us that this stupidity is
   true wisdom. But even if this same stupidity should seem to extend,
   sometimes to things of salvation, that is no proof that it is a sign of
   your being at a distance from God if it does not prevent you from
   fulfilling your duties, keeping the Rule, and carrying out your
   exercises of piety. You should, therefore, regard it as a trial from
   God which you have in common with nearly all the saints. Be faithful,
   and while accepting this apparent stupidity you will find in it a very
   meritorious exercise of patience, submission, and interior humility. It
   can only be prejudicial to self-love, which dies gradually and is thus
   destroyed and annihilated more efficaciously than by any exterior
   mortification.

   4th. When we have to make great sacrifices, nature and self-love,
   reluctant to do so, excite rebellions in the heart which seem to
   overthrow the whole soul. Did not Jesus Christ Himself experience the
   same in the Garden of Olives? It is enough therefore for the superior
   part of the soul to remain firm and to say with Jesus Christ, "Fiat
   voluntas tua." These are the interior combats of which St. Paul speaks,
   and after him all the masters of the spiritual life: this is how the
   just man truly lives by faith and escapes from the rule of the senses:
   these are the great victories which will be crowned in this world by
   peace, and the submission of the lower nature; in the next by the
   possession of a God.

   5th. The last and most efficacious of all the remedies I have to offer
   you is an entire and total abandonment into the hands of this God of
   goodness, Who has not ceased for a long time in being beforehand with
   the blessings of His very great mercy. You must throw yourself into
   this abandonment with the same courage with which you would cast
   yourself into the sea if God asked this sacrifice of you; in the same
   way as, in times past, a holy martyr by a particular attraction, and an
   especial inspiration threw herself into the midst of the flames without
   waiting for the executioners. It is this courage, and this holy
   abandonment founded on faith and love which charms the heart of God,
   and establishes in the soul a peace that nothing can disturb.

   6th. Your conduct in avoiding useless visits, waste of time, and
   distractions, seems to me excellent. Know that exterior solitude is the
   rampart of that which is interior which, without it, can with
   difficulty be preserved. I advise you to add, with regard to the people
   in the house, the greatest possible silence, never speaking without a
   reason, nor without some holy motive--such as for a necessary
   recreation, to refresh yourself a little, for the sake of charity, or
   religious condescension; or to overcome yourself about certain persons
   towards whom you may feel some antipathy. Finally I recall to your mind
   a maxim that I wish I could engrave on every heart, and especially on
   the hearts of Religious, and devout persons who are stressed and uneasy
   at seeing how poor, miserable and destitute they are; as they say with
   sighs and groans. This maxim alone can make them tranquil, contented,
   and even exceedingly rich in their spiritual poverty. You understand
   what I mean beforehand, that true perfection and consequently the real
   wealth of the soul consists in conforming our will to the will of God.
   Consequently every time that, overcome by the sense of your weakness
   and interior misery, you think that, while avoiding by the grace of
   God, everything that could offend Him, you are, at the same time very
   devoid of those gifts and graces by which the saints were enriched, you
   can and ought to say: "My God, I will all that You will and for as long
   as it pleases You." "But," you will say, "what resource shall I have if
   God takes me at my word, and keeps me always in this state of spiritual
   poverty?" You will have, my dear sister, only the Will of God, and this
   resource will take the place of every other. This divine and adorable
   Will will supply you with all the gifts in which you are wanting, it
   will become your treasure, and will constitute a spiritual fortune in
   the very midst of your poverty; for how can anyone be more rich in the
   sight of God than by conforming in all things to His most holy will
   even in those things that are most afflicting? Can anyone be more
   certain of possessing pure love, than those who resign themselves
   willingly to all that is most mortifying to that most sensitive form of
   self-love, spiritual self-love? Believe me, my dear Sister, the soul
   that regards its poverty in this light need not envy even those souls
   which are most greatly enriched with the gifts of God.

  Letter VII.--On Darkness and Want of Feeling.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On darkness and want of feeling.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister and very dear daughter in our Lord.

   May the peace of our Lord be always with you. By what you tell me I
   understand that you are in a state of obscurity but far from sharing
   the alarms that this state--a very ordinary one in persons of your
   sex--causes you; I believe it to be, unquestionably, the most safe
   because it is less exposed to the delusions of self-love, to attacks of
   vanity, and therefore, even this obscurity is a grace of God; for,
   during this life the way that leads most directly to God is the way of
   bare faith which is always obscure. In spite of this obscurity you are
   able to understand your state and to explain it clearly enough to
   enable any director with a little experience to guide you. I will tell
   you what I think about your general state and take your difficulties
   one by one.

   1st. You say you do not know how to pray. Experience has taught me that
   persons of good will who speak in this way know better than others how
   to pray, because their prayer is more simple and humble, but, on
   account of its simplicity it escapes their observation. To pray like
   this is to remain by faith in the presence of God, with a hidden, but
   constant desire to receive His grace according to our needs. As God
   sees all our desires, and as, according to St. Augustine, to desire
   always is to pray always, so in this consists our great prayer. Follow
   the leading of simplicity in prayer, there can never be excess of it,
   for God loves to see us like little children in His presence.

   2nd. As to Holy Communion, the increasing hunger that is felt for this
   divine Food, and the strength it imparts are great reasons for
   receiving It frequently. Therefore fear nothing, but rest on the
   assurance I give you.

   3rd. Insensibility towards all created things, and detachment even from
   relations, are greater graces than you imagine; it only remains to
   become detached from self by renouncing all interior self-seeking.
   Frequent union with Jesus Christ and prayer will gradually achieve this
   task, provided you do your share of the work in forgetting yourself to
   think only of God, abandoning to Him all your interests, both spiritual
   and temporal.

   4th. It is right that you should realise that all God requires of you
   is submission and resignation. Ah! my dear daughter, in that is
   comprised all perfection. To look for it elsewhere would be only error
   and illusion. Therefore a spiritual person inclined to an interior
   life, has, truly, but one thing to do, which is to submit with hearty
   concurrence, to all imaginable circumstances, whether interior or
   exterior, in which God wills to place him. Therefore when you are ill
   say "God wills it, very well, I will it also as He wills it and for as
   long a time." "But what if it should incapacitate me from fulfilling my
   duties and being of use to the community?" Well, if God wills it, will
   it also, and accept beforehand, with the pain you suffer, the holy
   abjection and humiliation which accompany it. "But in this state,
   perhaps, I give in to myself a little, and do not make all the efforts
   that I could and should make." If, even so after having consulted your
   superior and your confessor you follow their judgment blindly you are
   then doing the will of God which is also your will. Then rest satisfied
   in having acquiesced in the divine will in all this, and preserve that
   interior peace in which God dwells and works. This, my dear Sister, is
   a clear and safe way; follow it faithfully, and constantly reject all
   contrary thoughts and ideas as suggestions of the devil, who desires at
   least to disturb the interior peace in which your soul should be
   settled, and which forms the solid foundation of the spiritual life.

   5th. You have committed a grave fault of disobedience and imprudence in
   exposing yourself to three months of fever. Hold for certain that to
   reuse a dispensation in such circumstances is, by no means, an act of
   virtue, but stubbornness, and an obstinate attachment to your own
   judgment, and your own will under a pretext of piety. Many devotees and
   spiritual persons are to be pitied when they act in this manner, and
   great patience is required to put up with them. Their blindness and
   illusion are sometimes so strong that an angel from heaven would find a
   difficulty in making them see clearly. As for you, submit to
   everything, listen to every advice, suffer with all peace, gentleness,
   and patience, and do the will of God in all things, in the same spirit,
   this will be of great benefit to you.

   6th. They were quite right to forbid you to think of giving up your
   post, or of even wishing to do so. I, also, forbid you most strictly.
   Be very careful not to attempt to escape from the commands of God. "But
   I am not strong enough." God can very easily make you strong enough. "I
   am not clever enough." Well! the power of making you clever enough is
   not wanting to God, and He has already given you the principal
   qualification, which is, a distrust of your own powers. To know, and to
   feel one's incapacity is the essential thing, because then one depends
   entirely on God, applies to Him for everything, and attributes nothing
   to oneself, but all to God alone; and these graces will by themselves
   make everything prosper. In fine be at peace, and place your confidence
   in the God of all goodness; after that you can despair of yourself as
   much as you like. This humble feeling of your incapacity, weakness, and
   imbecility is exactly the instrument made use of by God to exalt His
   glory, and to make it shine forth more visibly.

   To have no feeling about the truths of religion is not a bad sign in
   certain souls; on the contrary, it is often a sign that God desires to
   lead them by the safest way, that of simple, bare faith without those
   feelings of devotion that He can give when He pleases. In the ways of
   God the only violent efforts to be used must be employed against sin,
   but with regard to everything else there must only be peace and
   tranquillity. When you find you cannot succeed in making acts say to
   yourself: "Very well! they are all made in the sight of God since He
   has seen my desire; He will enable me to make them when He pleases, He
   is Master. His most holy will shall always be my rule; to accomplish it
   is the reason I am in the world. It is my wealth, my treasure. May God
   grant to others all the light, talent, grace, gifts and sensible and
   spiritual sweetness that are pleasing to Him. As for me I desire
   nothing but to do His holy will. That is my wealth." This, my dear
   daughter, is your path, walk in it continually in peace, confidence,
   and abandonment of your whole self; you are in perfect safety.

   7th. In order to advance, endeavour to suffer peacefully all that God
   wills or permits to happen to you, without going to creatures to
   complain, or to seek consolation; neither try to find distraction in
   useless conversations, nor amusement in frivolous thoughts and idle
   projects for the future, as all this would withdraw you from God, and
   prevent the operations of His grace in you; so take great care.

   8th. To help you to occupy yourself with God easily and uninterruptedly
   according to your wishes and requirements this is what you ought to do.
   Firstly, love solitude and silence, for this will do much towards
   forming an interior spirit of recollection. Secondly, read only choice
   books that are solid, and full of piety, and read them slowly, with
   frequent pauses, trying more to enjoy, than to understand or remember
   them. Thirdly, during the day make frequent aspirations after God,
   especially those that occur to you in sufferings, temptations,
   weariness, disgust, sadness of heart, contradictions; etc.

   9th. The prayers you make to God for detachment from all things, are
   inspired by grace; continue them, and be assured that sooner or later
   they will be answered. It is but just that we should wait God's time,
   since we have kept Him waiting so long, and the great graces we ask of
   Him deserve to be desired and waited for with patience and
   perseverance.

  Letter VIII.--On Dryness and Distractions.

   To Sister Jeanne-Elizabeth Gaury (1735). On dryness and distractions
   during prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. Your method is very simple, and that which is simple is always
   best. It goes straight to God, and you must continue it; but do so
   quietly, without effort, and without eagerness either to preserve it,
   or to regain it when the perception of it has been lost; that would be
   to wish to appropriate to yourself the gift of God. In this method of
   prayer distractions and dryness are pretty frequent, but all the same
   if these are endured patiently and with abandonment to the will of God,
   it is an excellent prayer. Besides, although these distractions and
   this aridity are painful, they do not prevent the constant desire to
   pray which remains in the depths of the heart, and it is in this desire
   that heartfelt prayer consists.

   If you have been praying in this excellent manner for a considerable
   time, say for two or three years, it would serve no purpose to take a
   book; but if these times of powerlessness and aridity have lasted only
   for seven or eight consecutive days, then make use of a book, but read
   with frequent pauses; and should you find that this reading distracts
   you still more, or troubles your soul, leave it off, and try as well as
   you can to remain peacefully and silently in the presence of God.

   You need not be surprised, nor still less troubled that the very same
   things that used to touch you deeply, at one time, should now make not
   the slightest impression on you; this is one of the vicissitudes that
   have to be put up with interiorly just as the exterior vicissitudes of
   weather and seasons have to be borne; and it is only the very
   inexperienced who do not expect this.

   2nd. In this method of prayer resolutions are seldom made, but virtue
   is practised much more easily than when resolutions were made in
   meditation; because by the previous operation of the Holy Spirit the
   heart is disposed to do so when the occasion arises. The interior
   dispositions of persons following this method might be expressed in the
   following manner which would be of more value than any resolutions.
   "Lord make me do good and avoid evil on such occasions, or in such
   circumstances, otherwise I know by personal experience that I shall do
   exactly the reverse of what I ought."

   The sweetness and efficacy of holy recollection are often the prize and
   recompense of former sacrifices; but this sensible pleasure does not,
   at first, take away all repugnance and interior rebellion, though it
   gradually diminishes them until, in time, a sensible joy is felt even
   in the most bitter trials.

   3rd. God permits your slight infidelities to give you a deeper
   conviction of your weakness, and gradually to destroy in you that
   unhappy self-esteem, presumption and secret self-confidence which would
   never otherwise allow you to acquire true humility of heart. As you
   know nothing pleases God more than a complete contempt of self,
   accompanied by an absolute confidence in Him alone. This God of all
   goodness, therefore, does you a great favour in compelling you, often
   against your will, to drink from this chalice so much dreaded by your
   self-love and corrupt nature. And to know how to appreciate this favour
   at its proper value, and to realise your own happiness, are feelings so
   supernatural that they can only be attributed to the operation of the
   Holy Spirit. Another operation of grace is to feel happy in bearing
   some resemblance to Jesus Christ, but this feeling is not to be greatly
   depended on, have a fear of meeting with difficult circumstances, and
   distrust your own weakness.

   4th. There are never any illusions to be feared in repugnance and
   involuntary rebellion, as they are incompatible with holy prayer by
   which they are vanquished and overcome. You are wrong in persuading
   yourself that you will never be able to acquire true humility nor
   perfect mortification on account of feeling in yourself such a strong
   opposition to these virtues. If you had only your own powers to rely
   upon it would indeed be impossible, but as you very justly add
   yourself, with the help of God's grace merited for you by Jesus Christ,
   all becomes easy. It might happen that even this truth should make no
   impression on you and I should not be surprised if such were the case,
   but your remark to me on the subject proves plainly that like all
   beginners, you attach much too much importance to feelings of devotion.
   Nevertheless, it is an understood fact that in the order of
   supernatural operations of grace what is most sensible is least perfect
   and least safe, while that which is most spiritual and most hidden is
   by far the best. When God deprives you of His sensible presence, and of
   devotion in recollection, content yourself with having a holy desire
   and wish to retain it; this will suffice, as it is most pleasing to God
   and very meritorious.

   5th. Any disquiet is an injury to the soul, therefore you should exert
   all your energy to repel that which you experience on the subject of
   the divine Office, especially as there is no reason for it, the desire
   to say it well and the will to do so always remaining in spite of
   involuntary distractions, and yours are all of this kind. The proof of
   this is manifest, which is, that you feel a real pain at heart whenever
   you notice this wandering of the mind. What more certain, or better
   sign could you have that you have not consented? If you are afraid of
   distractions, it shows that they are not voluntary in their origin, and
   especially if you try to practice recollection during the day.
   Therefore be at peace and accept submissively these involuntary
   miseries.

   6th. You have shown me another subject of uneasiness; one which is of
   no consequence, and which has its foundation in various illusions, and
   of which you must cure yourself. The first is the great desire you have
   of sensible pleasure in Communion, and is an effect of spiritual
   self-love. The second is the belief that this sensible pleasure is a
   necessary condition of a good Communion. Alas! my dear daughter what
   would become of so many holy souls who usually feel nothing but
   dryness, callousness, and often distaste? In all our spiritual
   exercises we must approach God by pure faith which is scarcely felt.
   The less feeling you have in your communions and prayers the more
   likely they are to be purer and more pleasing to God. This is the way
   of bare faith and pure love which is never self-seeking. St. Francis of
   Sales used to say, "Our miserable satisfactions do not satisfy God."
   Pure love consists in being content with all that pleases God, and will
   not permit us to will anything contrary to the will of God, even as to
   our holiest desires and actions; nor, consequently, to act against His
   holy permissions; even should the cause of certain occurrences be the
   result of our own fault. This principle is either ignored, or, at
   least, obscured by the subtlety of our self-love, so ingenious in
   making out everything that satisfies it, or gives it pleasure to be
   good and holy. A good Religious speaking on this subject said that God
   had gradually taken away all her pleasure, and all the spiritual
   attractions and feelings in whatever she did, to purify her love, which
   the first sweetness had left so imperfect and impure.

   For communion and the spiritual exercises of the morning and evening
   follow the method that most attracts you. One short act of your own is
   worth more than all the long prayers you read. The indifference you
   feel as to what is thought or said about you is an effect of the
   operation of the Holy Spirit. Continue as you are doing, never excusing
   nor justifying yourself, unless you are ordered to do so; it is the
   most perfect way of acting. God be praised for all, and in all. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IX.--Passive Recollection.

   To Mother Louise-Françoise de Rosen. On distractions, weariness, and
   impulses.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister. To all the anxieties you express in your letter to me,
   and to all the doubts you lay before me, I have but one answer. I will
   say to you in the words of our good Master: "Peace be with you, fear
   not." What troubles you, ought, on the contrary, to be a subject of
   joy. Where you believe you see symptoms of laxness I see undoubted
   signs of solid progress.

   1st. This inattention, almost perpetual, this weariness and distaste
   that you experience at prayer, at the Office, at Confession and
   Communion, etc., are nothing else but the natural effect of the
   apparent absence of God. The divine Spouse of your soul, in order to
   put it to the test and to purify it, withdraws His sensible presence,
   and then the poor soul suffers acute grief which sometimes affects the
   bodily health. In this way it is a martyr of grace, and of the Holy
   Spirit; for, now that there are no longer any tyrants to make the blood
   of the martyrs flow in testimony of their faith, the Holy Spirit knows
   how to make martyrs of divine love by the suffering caused by His
   apparent absences, and by many kinds of crucifying operations. Those
   who submit to this spiritual torture do so by practising resignation,
   blind abandonment, and the same unwearied patience that the martyrs of
   old practised in the midst of their torments. The same Holy Spirit who
   filled the souls of the martyrs with divine peace and joy, while their
   bodies were suffering the most frightful torments, will in the same way
   preserve the peace of your soul in spite of all the agitation of your
   mind and senses. But you must, faithfully, co-operate with His action
   by giving no voluntary consent to the anxieties which assail you. To
   regain recollection when you think you have, to some extent, lost it,
   make no violent efforts. Resign yourself with a good grace to being
   deprived of sensible and active recollection, and be content with
   passive recollection which subsists at the bottom of your heart, even
   when the mind seems all astray, for this is the inalienable right of
   souls that are free from all inordinate love for the things of this
   world. It is true that in this state God is not always the distinct
   object of our thoughts, but He is the principle of our life, and the
   rule of our actions. There is a kind of abstraction during which it
   seems to us that we do not think of anything, because, on the one hand
   visible objects do not occupy us, and on the other we have such a
   general idea of God, a notion so dim and obscure, that the mind cannot
   grasp it, and loses itself, seeming to have no consciousness, and to
   escape control. In this state all that has to be done, being suggested
   by the Spirit of God gently, is carried out in peace, without eagerness
   or uneasiness. But, directly the activity of self-love begins to
   meddle, the Holy Spirit, jealously desirous of being the only guide of
   the soul He has raised to this state, puts a limit to its action, and
   then there is nothing to be done but to drop this activity, and to
   resume and re-enter the state of passive recollection. This
   recollection, you must know, is nothing else but the fruit and the
   extension of the prayer of quiet and of silence, which consists in
   holding one's peace interiorly, and in leaving off all thoughts rather
   than in combating those that come, or in seeking for those that do not
   present themselves.

   2nd. The occasional outbursts to which you give vent, sometimes lasting
   for a lengthy period are trials that should prove equally fruitful.
   While causing you interior suffering they bring you infinite riches,
   purifying, humiliating and diminishing you so much in your own eyes
   that you will gradually become like those little children whom Jesus
   Christ desires us to resemble if we wish to enter into His kingdom. You
   are quite right in saying that we have a great need of patience and
   gentleness in bearing with ourselves; perhaps more than in putting up
   with others, following out the thought of St. Francis of Sales.

   3rd. The continual vicissitudes that take place in the soul are a good
   sign. By them the Holy Spirit renders us pliant to all His movements;
   for, by dint of these constant changes nothing of self remains, and we
   are prepared to take any shape that is pleasing to this divine Spirit
   who breathes where He will and as He pleases. It is, as Fénélon says,
   like a continual melting and recasting of the soul, which, in this
   process, becomes liquid like water having neither form nor shape but
   taking any form or shape according to that of the vessel into which it
   is poured.

   4th. It will be quite easy for you to guide yourself in these different
   situations. You have but one thing to do, and that is quite simple, it
   is to notice in what direction the deepest bias of your heart inclines
   you, without consulting the mental attitude which would spoil all.
   Always act with the same simplicity, in good faith and uprightness of
   heart, without looking back or about you, but straight in front at the
   present time and moment, and I will answer for everything. Do you not
   see that such a way of acting is to die to self perpetually by the most
   complete abnegation, and a true sacrifice of abandonment to God in the
   darkness of faith.

   5th. You say that you do not experience any interior reproach, nor any
   feeling either for good or evil, and that this silence seems to you
   terrible. It is part of your state. All feeling ought to be taken from
   you: it is so in the state of pure faith. Again, fear nothing, go on in
   peace, in simplicity, in total abandonment, without self-examination or
   particular reflexions: when any should be made God will give them to
   you, or supply the want of them by an interior feeling or a hidden
   attraction which will guide you in everything more surely than your own
   miserable reflexions. Are these, then, so precious that you need regret
   their loss and the deprivation of them? Blessed are the poor in spirit
   for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. Love this spiritual poverty which
   strips us interiorly of self, as exterior poverty strips us of goods.
   It is thus that the kingdom of God is formed within us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter X.--The Use of Faults.

   To the same person. On weariness and idleness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I see nothing in your present state that should alarm you. This
   weariness, idleness, and indolence that we experience occasionally in
   spite of ourselves has no culpability about it, provided we suffer it
   with resignation, and do not curtail any of our exercises of piety in
   spite of the disinclination we feel to perform them. If, with this want
   of feeling about everything else we experience a strong desire for the
   Sacraments and a great contrition for our faults, it is a sensible
   effect of the mercy of God Who makes use even of our faults to make us
   increase in fervour and humility.

   There are two kinds of interior peace; one is sensible, sweet and
   delightful, and this kind does not, in any way, depend on ourselves,
   and is not at all necessary. And there is another which is almost
   imperceptible, which dwells in the depths of the heart in the most
   hidden recesses of the soul. It is usually dry and unfelt, and can be
   retained in the midst of the greatest tribulations. To recognise it
   would require the most profound recollection, you would say it was
   hidden in a deep abyss. It is there that God dwells, and He fashions it
   Himself in order to dwell there as in an atmosphere of His own in the
   inner chamber of our hearts from whence He works marvellous but
   inscrutable things. These can only be recognised by their effects, as,
   when, by His beneficent influence you feel yourself capable of
   remaining firm in the midst of trials, violent shocks, great pain, and
   unforeseen misfortunes. If you find that you possess this dry peace and
   a sort of quiet sadness, you ought to thank God for it; this is all
   that is necessary for your spiritual progress. Guard it as a most
   precious gift. As it gradually increases it will one day become your
   greatest treasure, but this will not be till after many battles and
   many victories.

   I congratulate you on having adopted my favourite motto, "God wills it!
   God be praised in all things." Oh! what consolation there is in these
   few words! St. Francis of Sales said it was a tonic for the heart by
   virtue of which it would never give way; a strong potion which would
   enable us to digest iron, steel, and any other hard or revolting object
   that we were obliged to swallow, a balsam that could soothe and heal
   the most poisonous wounds. Oh! my dear daughter! let us make use of
   this remedy against the weakness of nature which opposes everything
   that is contrary to our inclination. By the use of this simple recipe
   you will find bitter things become sweet and everything will seem good
   and pleasant; nothing could better cheer the heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XI.--Remembrance of Past Sins.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Bousmard. On weakness remembrance of past
   sins, fatigue, and fears. Nancy, 1734.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. The calmness you enjoy in solitude, and the peace of mind and
   heart which, emptied of all created things, is no longer occupied with
   them in any way, are signs of true interior recollection. God deprives
   you of feelings of devotion during prayer, to prevent the desires and
   eagerness they give rise to. While you are at prayer remain exactly as
   you are in solitude. I do not exact from you an atom more of
   application or attention. Continue in this thoughtful pensive state
   without allowing your thoughts to dwell on created things and then you
   will be in God without understanding how, without feeling His presence,
   nor even knowing how this can be. This is a mystery which you will only
   be able to recognise by its happy effects which are--death to self, and
   unconsciousness of the things of this world.

   2nd. To believe that you do nothing for God, and that the little you
   try to do is spoilt by an admixture of self-love, is nothing but the
   truth, and a truth so self-evident that it is extraordinary that it is
   not seen by everyone, and that we are not all trembling and annihilated
   before God. On the other hand, however, this truth is so shrouded in
   darkness for us, so completely hidden in the folds of our self-love,
   that we cannot be too grateful to God when He is pleased to allow us to
   grasp it.

   When it pleases God to grant us by His holy grace, this clear knowledge
   of ourselves, accompanied by feelings of humility; then we no longer
   expect anything more from self, but everything from Him alone. No
   longer do we count on our good works, but solely on the mercy of God
   and the infinite merits of Jesus Christ; this is that true Christian
   hope which will be our salvation. Every other state, every other
   spiritual condition is full of risks to our salvation; but, to hope
   only in God, to depend only on God, in and through Jesus Christ, is
   that solid and immovable foundation that neither illusion, self-love,
   nor temptation can affect.

   Oh! how I congratulate you on having arrived at this state! Hold to it
   firmly, it is the anchor of the vessel in the harbour of salvation.

   3rd. I am glad to find, by your letter, how completely the good God in
   His mercy is keeping you in the dark. You attribute to your wickedness
   the recollections of the past which fill you with horror of yourself;
   but it is as clear as day that this is one of the most salutary
   impressions that grace can produce in you; there is, in fact, nothing
   better calculated to sanctify you than this holy hatred of yourself
   occasioned by these recollections, and the deep humiliation in which
   they keep you before God. These feelings are given you suddenly when
   you least expect them or are thinking of them, to make you understand
   that they are an effect of grace. "But why used you formerly to
   experience exactly contrary feelings when recalling the past?" It is
   because formerly you would not have been able to endure the sight of
   your imperfections without great despondency. It was necessary then
   that hope should predominate in you, but now you require a holy horror
   of yourself which is a true change of heart. When God gives you these
   feelings, receive them quietly and with gratitude and thanksgiving, and
   allow them to pass away when God pleases, abandoning yourself entirely
   to all He wishes to effect in you, and do not attach yourself to any of
   the interior conditions in which He places you, nor regret any of which
   He deprives you.

   4th. I understand the difficulties of the duty about which you speak,
   and the strain to tired lungs of sustaining the chant, especially on
   great feast days. All this is very painful it is true, but what is also
   true and extremely consoling is that such is the will of God, and
   permitted by Him that you may overcome your own will. In a few words I
   will suggest to you how to act in this, and in any similar case.
   Prayers, frankness, sacrifice, abandonment. I will explain my meaning.
   Having implored light from God, go and explain clearly to your Superior
   how you feel, and in what state you are, then wait to hear from her
   mouth what God is pleased to arrange for you, being resolved to
   sacrifice to Him by perfect abandonment your dislikes, your health, and
   even your life, never doubting that, God Who has never been known to
   forsake those who abandon themselves to Him, will inspire her who is
   charged to manifest to you His will, to tell you what is necessary. One
   of three things will infallibly happen; either you will be relieved of
   your office, or God will sustain and preserve you in it, or else He
   will allow you to succumb and will take you to Himself out of this
   wretched life. Then, I ask you, my good Sister, if you could end your
   life in a better manner than by a sacrifice so generous, and an act of
   abandonment so perfect? Whatever happens, then, keep firm after making
   your attempt. Live or die in peace. We will not speak about it any
   more, it is God's affair, and no longer yours. He well knows how to
   make everything turn to your advantage, and to His own greater glory.
   Oh! my dear Sister! in what a saintly, happy, and generous manner you
   will be able to act! How good it is to have chosen, once for all, the
   part of obedience and abandonment in all things! What peace! what a
   sacrifice! what a grace! what certainty of salvation! and above all,
   what merit in the eyes of God! What a consolation for me, in such a
   case, to learn that you have died a martyr to holy abandonment, and
   that God has permitted you to immolate yourself as a holocaust on the
   altar of His most holy, most adorable, and divine Will.

   5th. Make yourself, therefore, a partaker of the contentment of God;
   place your happiness in the knowledge that His good pleasure is always
   accomplished in you; in this way even when you have occasion to be
   dissatisfied with yourself, you will reflect the satisfaction of God
   who, as St. Augustine remarks, is never so pleased with us as when we
   are displeased with ourselves. In this way it is that we constantly
   practise without even adverting to it the virtue of pure charity which
   consists in loving, in satisfying, and in willing in all things the
   good pleasure of God, preferring His holy will to everything that we
   could possibly wish, however holy our wishes might appear to be. You
   have chiefly two ways of exercising this meritorious abandonment. The
   first is, to say to God, "Lord I hate and detest my sins and
   imperfections, and I will make every effort to correct myself with the
   help of Your divine grace; as for the pain and abjection they bring me
   I accept this with all my heart for the love of You." The second way is
   to say, "My God, I desire to please You, I desire my own salvation and
   sanctification, the gift of prayer, of mortification, and of all
   virtues. I ask them of You, and I will exert all my powers to acquire
   them, whenever You show me an occasion of doing so; nevertheless in
   this as in all other things I prefer Your holy will to my own wishes, I
   only desire to possess that degree of grace and virtue that You are
   pleased to bestow on me, and at the time appointed by Your divine
   wisdom even should that be the last moment of my life; for Your most
   holy will is the rule and measure of my desires, even of those that are
   most holy and lawful." These acts, made with the whole heart, are the
   fruit of that pure charity which, according to the Doctors of the
   Church, is as efficacious as baptism and martyrdom for blotting out all
   our sins; as Jesus Christ said about Mary Magdalen, "Many sins are
   forgiven her because she has loved much." Could anything be more
   consoling, fortifying and encouraging? You say that you live in a mean
   and poor way. "Blessed are the poor in spirit." By this is intended
   interior humility and a holy self-contempt. You live without
   assistance, that is to say that you live in spirit, and in pure faith.
   Oh! what a happy state! Yes, happy indeed although this happiness is
   hidden from the soul. You go on blindly from day to day. This is
   perfect abandonment, you do not feel it, and hardly realise it, but if
   you felt and understood it, it would no longer be abandonment, but the
   strongest assurance of your salvation that you could possibly desire.
   For, what assurance could you have more satisfactory than the knowledge
   of being completely abandoned to God both for time and eternity?
   Abandonment is a virtue the entire merit of which cannot be acquired,
   unless the possession of it is unrealised. Go on in peace, then, in the
   midst of your fears, pains, and obscurities, and put your whole trust
   in God above all knowledge, and all feeling, in, and through Jesus
   Christ. May He be with you for ever.

  Letter XII.--How to make use of trials.

   On the use of trials and how to act about them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Before anything else, my dear Sister, I think I had better explain what
   thought was suggested to me by your anxious doubts, and eagerness to
   consult me about your soul. I cannot help thinking that, if we were
   more attentive to the light given us by the Holy Spirit, better
   disposed to receive His holy impressions, and more faithful in
   following the impulsion of His grace, nothing more would be required to
   enable us to attain that perfection to which we are called; for I have
   noticed that even in the midst of the most profound spiritual darkness,
   there is ever in the centre of the soul a certain light of pure faith
   which is a most safe guide. Besides this, there are certain moments
   when the Holy Spirit makes known to us by a brighter, but very rapid
   light, that we are in the right way. Add to this a certain settled
   peace, even during interior storms, a right way of acting, and a
   regularity in the performance of duties, which, in spite of the frailty
   of nature, we never deliberately set aside, but follow with
   perseverance the maxims of the Gospel and the rules of perfection. An
   obedient and faithful soul ought to find in this a sufficient guarantee
   for confidently trusting herself with entire abandonment to this
   interior Spirit who guides her so well. It is often a sign of weakness,
   and an effect of the workings of self-love that we hanker after more
   complete assurance. However, there are exceptions to be made, such as
   the beginning of the spiritual life when the Holy Spirit has not yet
   acquired full dominion over us, and some extraordinary occasions when
   the tumult of the storm prevents us hearing His voice. I might content
   myself with this general reply but will, however, answer you in detail.

   1st. This fresh condition of obscurity, dryness and distaste, into
   which God has permitted you to enter does not surprise me. This good
   Master always begins by making Himself known and loved in sensible
   devotion, and afterwards deprives the soul of these consolations to
   withdraw it from the earthliness of the senses, in order to unite it to
   Himself in a far more excellent way, more intimate and solid, by pure
   faith entirely spiritual. To make this purification complete, suffering
   has to be added to privation, at least interior suffering, interior
   rebellion, diabolical temptations, anguish, weakness, and repugnance
   for all that is good which sometimes rises to a sort of agony. All this
   serves marvellously to deliver the soul from self-love and to give it
   some trace of resemblance to its crucified Spouse. All these trials are
   so many blows that are inflicted on us by God to make us die to self.
   The more strongly self-love struggles against these blows the harder
   they seem and the more cruel the agony. Divine love is a two-edged
   sword, and strikes self-love until it is killed and destroyed. Great
   sorrow in these trials proceeds from the strong resistance of our
   cursed love of self which is loth to relinquish the empire it has
   gained over our hearts, and to allow the love of God to reign in its
   stead. This love produces only sweetness and delight as long as it
   finds no obstacles to its divine influence, nor any enemy to resist it.

   Do not regret, then, in any way those days that you pronounce happy
   because you enjoyed sensible devotion in prayer and communion, and
   because your union with your Beloved was so charming and delightful.
   How much more precious and of inestimable value are your present days
   of agony and martyrdom! These are days of the purest love, since in
   them you are loving God at your own cost, and for Himself alone. You
   need not fear any mixture of self-love in your intercourse with Him,
   since there is nothing in this intercourse but what is crucifying to
   self-love. In such a state our will is united to the will of God, and
   it is this that we love, and with a love so pure that the senses have
   no share in it. It is most difficult indeed to love God in happiness
   without any admixture of self, or of vain self-complacency, but in the
   time of crosses, and of interior spiritual privations, all that is
   needful in order to be certain of the purity of our love, is to endure
   them patiently, and to abandon ourselves sincerely. How truly consoling
   and encouraging is this certainty for those who understand the value
   and advantages of pure love. When God makes you understand this you
   will also understand why so many of the saints preferred privations and
   sufferings to consolations and joys, how they so passionately loved the
   former that they could hardly put up with the latter. God may possibly
   allow you to think that this painful state is going to last you your
   life-time, in order to give you an opportunity of making Him a more
   complete sacrifice. Do not waver, do not hesitate for a single moment,
   sacrifice all! abandon yourself without reserve, without limitation to
   Him, by Whom you imagine yourself abandoned, and keep yourself always
   in this interior state which is, at present, the most essential for
   you. I would almost say it is the only one for you during prayer, at
   Holy Communion, at Mass, during the Office, and all the day long; but
   attend to this quietly without effort, and do not even attach yourself
   to the frequent repetition of formal acts, it will suffice to keep your
   soul in this habitual condition of total abandonment without any
   reserve. I forbid you, therefore, voluntarily to desire anything but
   the accomplishment of the most holy will of God. Ask neither for more
   nor less pain, God knows better than we do the right measure that is
   necessary for us. It is very often nothing but presumption and illusion
   that makes us wish to imitate certain saints who, in their sufferings
   were especially inspired to say, "More, Lord, more!" We are too little
   and too weak to dare to speak thus unless we have a moral conviction
   that God requires it of us. I forbid you also, all voluntary scruples,
   troubles, or doubts on the subject of the Office, of Holy Mass, etc. To
   act with a pure intention, and in simple good faith is enough; in this
   respect God asks no more of us, and I daresay you would not be able to
   do more at present.

   2nd. Oh! how glad I am to hear you say that you are insupportable to
   yourself, that at every moment you are on the point of falling into a
   state of despondency and trouble, without, by God's grace actually
   doing so. That is to say that God, in making you understand all your
   weakness upholds you invisibly, thus giving you the victory, while at
   the same time preserving you in humility. You might very likely lose
   this virtue, either entirely, or to some extent, if you found yourself
   possessed of courage, or felt some spiritual strength. Learn from this
   a most important lesson inculcated by Fénélon. It is a pure grace from
   God, and one of the greatest to suffer in a petty way, to conquer in a
   feeble manner, that is to say with a sort of spiritual feebleness,
   humbly and with self-contempt, and to be so discontented with ourselves
   that we do not believe that we ever do anything well. This discontent
   with ourselves is very pleasing to God, and His content should be the
   basis of our own. Nothing could give us any further anxiety if we found
   our sole satisfaction in pleasing and satisfying God.

   3rd. God gives you a great grace also in enabling you while in your
   present state to faithfully fulfil all your duties and rules. I greatly
   commend you for having sought no consolation from creatures and for
   having made no mention of your troubles to anyone even in confidence.
   Your silence will sanctify you more than any conversation or advice.

   4th. Another great grace is to feel neither trouble, nor fear nor
   anxiety about your present state, nor about the future, just as though
   you had become callous about everything. This is the fruit and happy
   effect of your entire abandonment. As you have abandoned all to God, He
   takes charge of everything, banishing all trouble, fear, and anxiety
   from your soul. He takes from it all feelings of self-interest, and
   leaves it alive only to His interests. This disposition is the solid
   foundation of the most absolute security that a soul could possibly
   enjoy, it is the greatest happiness this life contains for us, and a
   sure sign of the friendship of God.

   5th. The words that were spoken to you interiorly, and that you heard
   so distinctly were assuredly from God. I recognise this by the good and
   immediate effects they produced in you. Only God can impress souls to
   such a profound extent with whatever He pleases. You see that the
   divine goodness does not refuse you occasional scraps of comfort and
   strength to fortify you during the journey He makes you take through
   the desert.

   6th. There is no reason to be surprised that your spiritual afflictions
   have no influence with regard to your conduct towards your neighbour,
   nor deprive you of your patience and equable temper, and kindness. As a
   rule while in this state of trial one is generally more able to help,
   to console, to comfort, and to serve others.

  Letter XIII.--The Use of Trials continued.

   To Sister Anne-Marguérite Boudet de la Bellière (1734). The use of
   trials continued.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. Your present state of obscurity is a real grace from God, Who
   desires to accustom you to walk in the darkness of pure faith which is
   the most meritorious way, and the most certain road to sanctity.

   2nd. Dryness and powerlessness are graces equally precious, and make
   you participate very meritoriously in the sufferings of Jesus Christ.
   "But," say you, "this powerlessness prevents me asking God for
   necessary helps." At any rate, it does not prevent you wishing to ask
   for them, and you ought to know that with God, our desires are real
   prayers, according to St. Augustine. This made Bossuet say that a cry
   pent up in the depths of the heart was of the same value as a cry that
   reached the skies, because God sees our most secret desires, and even
   the first simple movement of the heart. Apply these principles to your
   own case, whether at prayer, or before and after Communion. Nothing
   more is required to make our intercourse with God safe, easy and
   efficacious in spite of aridity, involuntary distractions and
   powerlessness, because none of these things prevent the desire to pray
   well, or to sigh and lament before God. His all-seeing eye detects the
   pure intention and preparation of heart, with all those acts that we
   should wish to have made; as He sees the fruits of the trees before the
   buds of springtime have formed on the branches; this is the beautiful
   comparison made by the Bishop of Meaux.

   In God's name, my dear Sister, try to enter into this maxim and to make
   it your own; it will console and sustain you on a thousand occasions
   when you feel that you are doing nothing, are incapable of making any
   effort. The good will is always there, and that is everything in the
   sight of God even when you imagine it to be absolutely idle.

   3rd. Acquiescence in and submission to the will of God and the union of
   our will with His are so essential to perfection that it may be said to
   consist entirely in adhering firmly to them in all things, everywhere,
   and for everything. To do this is to do all, and without this, prayers,
   austerities, and works of even the most heroic nature, and all our
   sufferings, are nothing in the sight of God, because the only way in
   which we can please Him is by conforming our wills to His. The more
   involuntary opposition to this complete resignation we feel in
   ourselves, the more merit shall we gain on account of the greater
   effort required, and of the more complete sacrifice exacted.

   4th. The knowledge and fear of the traps that are laid for us in all
   quarters both outside and within our own souls is exactly the grace
   that will enable us to avoid them, especially if, with this humble fear
   a great confidence in God is united; then we can rely on being always
   victorious, except perhaps in matters of minor importance where God
   permits us to fall for our greater good. These lesser falls are very
   salutary for us, in keeping us always lowly and humbled in the presence
   of God, distrustful of our own powers, and as it were, nothing in our
   own eyes.

   5th. You must accustom yourself to seek, and to find the peace of your
   soul in the higher part, that which is furthest removed from the
   senses; and disregard the troubles, revolts, and uneasiness of the
   lower and animal part which should be accounted of no importance
   because God pays no attention to what takes place there. St. Teresa
   says that it is like the courtyard of the castle of the soul. Take
   advantage of this teaching which is that of the saints, and behave as a
   person who, finding the courtyard of her castle full of unclean animals
   and hideous reptiles does not stop there a moment, but mounts at once
   to the upper rooms which are well furnished and filled with an
   honourable company. Do you also mount into the sanctuary of the soul,
   and endeavour always to remain there, because it is there that God
   makes His permanent dwelling.

   6th. Yes, you were right to abandon yourself to God in all things, and
   to cease disturbing your mind voluntarily with the recollection of the
   frequent experiences you have had of your misery and weakness; in this
   way the foundation of true humility and a complete self-distrust is
   laid and consolidated. These valuable dispositions draw down upon us
   all the graces of God and bring them to us clothed with His power;
   especially if He finds us convinced of our own powerlessness to do any
   good. This it was that made St. Paul exclaim, "When I am weak, then am
   I powerful."

   7th. I assure you on the part of God, that usually, indeed nearly
   always, when you think you are praying your worst, that is the very
   time when you are praying best. Why? Because on the one hand the will,
   and the firm desire to pray is a real prayer of the heart; and because,
   on the other hand, you pray then without any self-complacency, without
   any of those vain reflexions which spoil everything; you pray by your
   patience, your silence, your self-effacement, your submission and
   abandonment to God; and you leave off praying greatly humiliated and
   cast down, and without any of those sensible feelings of satisfaction
   to your self-love that made St. Francis of Sales say that our own
   miserable satisfactions were not those of God. You may judge by this
   with what contempt you ought to repulse the fears by which the enemy
   tries to disgust, and to weary you, or at least to throw you into a
   state of anxiety.

   8th. The great and sincere desire you have to be all for God without
   reserve, and whatever it may cost, St. Francis of Sales calls the firm
   pillar of spiritual spiritual edifice. This pillar ought to sustain the
   whole weight. Fear nothing as long as it remains, and it will remain,
   by the grace of God, in the superior part of the soul; as for the
   inferior or sensitive part, think nothing about it.

   9th. It is quite true that we can conquer self-love, but not without
   great trouble, and remember that this is far more the work of God than
   our own. Take advantage of little occasions for combats and victories,
   and be well assured that when God sees that, in good earnest, you are
   doing the little that is in your power with the help of ordinary
   graces, He will at last set His own hand to the task, and finish and
   perfect the work you could not accomplish. It is on this account that I
   advise you always to beg of God without ceasing the gift of His divine
   Spirit with all His holy operations, without which it is possible to
   spend a life-time in great defects and considerable imperfections from
   which there is great risk of never rising, but rather of falling ever
   lower, and even of being lost.

   10th. Holy Communion is the true daily bread of our souls. In it alone
   can we find subsistence, power, remedy, and support. What a difference
   there is between those who communicate frequently, and those who do so
   but rarely! Oh! how little do the latter realise the riches, and the
   treasures of grace of which they deprive themselves!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIV.--Remedies for Troubles.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil (1734). The use of trials
   continued.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   To apply a remedy to the trouble that makes you so unhappy, it will
   suffice for me to indicate the causes of it, in order to oppose it with
   the contrary principles. The origin of the evil is first an ignorance
   of your attraction. It seems to me that you have forgotten that divine
   grace makes different souls experience different attractions, some
   sweet, and some exceedingly crucifying. Among people in the world there
   are those whom God conducts by the way of prosperity; but a far greater
   number whom He compels to walk in the thorny path of the Cross, of
   afflictions and difficulties. Thus He apportions, according to His
   wisdom, spiritual joys and tribulations to those who lead a spiritual
   life. The work of salvation and perfection consists in following
   faithfully the path allotted to us according to the attraction God has
   given us, whatever this may be.

   1st. You seem equally ignorant of this great principle, that usually
   more progress is made by suffering than by acting, and that to take
   things patiently is to do a great deal, and especially to be patient
   with oneself.

   2nd. You forget, at any rate in practice, this other incontestable
   truth, that perfection does not consist in receiving great gifts from
   God such as recollection, prayer and the spiritual taste for divine
   things, but simply in fulfilling the will of God in every possible
   circumstance whether exterior or interior, and in whatever situation
   Providence may be pleased to place you.

   3rd. Your troubles proceed from this ignorance and forgetfulness
   together with those anxieties and that interior depression which have
   embittered and doubled your pains, and have deprived you of the peace
   of your soul which is the foundation of the spiritual life, and have
   often led you to seek consolation in creatures by confiding your
   troubles to them when it was God's will that you should have no
   consolation but that which He was pleased to give you Himself. You must
   correct this by other rules of conduct and a totally different way of
   acting.

   1st Principle. Often say to yourself, "My way is painful, it is true;
   it is hard and bitter, but as it is the will of God I must submit, no
   matter what it costs; firstly, because God is my sovereign Master who
   has a right to dispose of me absolutely as He pleases. Secondly,
   because He is my father, and so tender, good, and merciful a Father
   that He can will nothing that is not for the benefit of the children
   whom He loves, and makes all things turn to the benefit of those who
   are submissive to Him. Thirdly, because I shall never find peace, calm,
   nor repose of heart, nor any solid consolation except in resigning
   myself humbly and patiently to all that He is pleased to ordain.
   Fourthly, because I cannot take a single step in the spiritual life
   unless I follow the path marked out, and decided for me in the eternal
   decree of my predestination. Can I mark out a path for myself? And if I
   could, would it not be like the path of a blind man, leading to
   destruction?

   2nd Principle. "I ought to desire only that progress and perfection
   which God wills for me, and to wish to attain them only by those means
   He wills me to employ." Such a desire can only be calm and peaceful,
   although at the same time, full of power and energy. There is, however,
   another kind of desire for perfection, born of pride, and of an
   inordinate love of one's own excellence. This does not rely upon God
   for support, and besides, is restless and always in a state of turmoil.
   The more we have to give ourselves up to the first of these desires,
   the more strenuously we must resist the second. Therefore every desire
   for our progress, however holy it may seem, must be suppressed directly
   it shows signs of eagerness, disquiet or anxiety. These effects can
   only proceed from the devil, while everything that comes from God
   leaves the soul tranquil. Why then, my dear Sister, do you desire with
   such fiery eagerness those lights of the soul, those feelings, interior
   joys, and that facility of recollection and prayer, and other gifts of
   God, if it does not please Him to bestow them on you yet? Would not
   this be to make yourself perfect for your own pleasure, and not for
   His? To follow your own and not the divine will, to have more regard
   for your own inclination than for that of God, to wish to serve Him
   according to your own caprice, and not according to His good pleasure!
   "Ought I then to be resigned to spending my whole life in this state of
   poverty, weakness and misery?" Certainly, if such is the will of God.
   Your poverty, weakness and misery ought from henceforth to be pleasant
   to you, and preferable to any other state since it is willed for you by
   God. Henceforth this poverty will be converted into wealth, for to be
   exactly what God wills is to be very rich indeed, and all perfection
   consists in this alone. Moreover are you not aware that there is heroic
   virtue in the patient endurance of misery, weakness, spiritual poverty,
   darkness and callousness, of fickleness, folly, and extravagance of
   mind and imagination? It was this that made St. Francis of Sales say
   that those who aspired to perfection required to exercise as much
   patience, kindness, and endurance towards themselves as towards others.
   Let us then bear our own burdens of misery, imperfection, and defects
   in the same way that God wills us to bear one another's burdens. It
   often happens however that, in this spiritual tumult the will endures
   strange commotions, and is on the point of giving way out of all
   patience. Let us keep firm for in this new battlefield fighting for
   patience and making fresh sacrifices we shall find fresh subjects for
   merit and triumph. And if during the first moments the poor will should
   escape, it must be made to try to regain possession of itself in
   humbling itself quietly and peacefully before the infinite mercy of
   God.

   "But all these spiritual vicissitudes take off my attention from
   prayer, Holy Mass, the Office, and Holy Communion, and my spiritual
   exercises seem useless." No! No! none of them are useless, because
   merely the will to acquit yourself well of these duties, which you
   formed at the beginning will be valid throughout, unless nullified by
   long continued and altogether voluntary distractions, in a word, by
   deliberate venial sin. Far from losing anything, you will have gained
   doubly, because combined with the merit gained by your spiritual
   exercises will be that of having made them in a most penitential and
   crucifying manner, and also with much humiliation; in this way, very
   far from having spoilt these holy exercises by foolish
   self-examination, and a thousand satisfactions of self-love, to which
   you would have been exposed in making them with feelings of devotion,
   you will have fulfilled these duties well by the practice of holy
   humility which is the foundation and guardian of every virtue. "But
   this will prevent me from feeling contrite." The efficacy of contrition
   is not in the feeling of it, it is entirely in the higher part of the
   soul--in the will. Sensible contrition very frequently serves only as
   food for self-love and can never be reassuring, since it is not what
   God requires."But supposing I have no contrition of the will?" You
   should believe and hope firmly that God has given it to you; but if you
   should only have had contrition once after having already confessed
   your sins it would be enough to remit them all, both past and present
   sins, so great is the mercy of God.

   My dear Sister, I will conclude with this consoling assurance; if it
   had pleased God to make your state known to you as it is to me, you
   would be thanking Him for it instead of afflicting yourself about it.
   Remain in peace then in whatever condition you may possibly find
   yourself: when you have achieved that you will have done all that is
   necessary. Repeat constantly "Blessed be God for all and in all. I wish
   only what He wills and nothing more. May His holy will be done in me,
   and by me. May none of my wishes be accomplished; they are all blind
   and perverse. I shall be lost if they are accomplished."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XV.--Trials to be Endured Peacefully.

   To the same person. Trials to be endured peacefully.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. We are entirely of one mind, my dear Sister, now that you admit
   with me that your activity and eagerness are defects. Strive against
   them with all your strength, that is all that I ask. You say that I
   want you to be faultless and quite perfect. That is true, and has
   always been the object I had in view for you. At the same time I do not
   consider it a crime that you have not yet attained this perfection. I
   realise that this can only be achieved gradually by a great confidence
   in God, and a great fidelity to His grace. He alone can accomplish in
   you the work He has begun; what you have to do is simply to abandon
   yourself to Him, and to allow Him to act. Do not be one of those of
   whom Jesus Christ said, speaking to St. Catherine of Siena, that they
   made hardly any progress in perfection because they talked so much
   themselves, that they could not listen to Him, and would act
   themselves, and gave Him no opportunity of acting in them.

   2nd. I am delighted to hear that you feel that God supports you in your
   afflictions; continue to endure them as peacefully as you can, and in a
   perfect interior silence. This practice alone will cause you to advance
   in a calm and peaceful way. God has given you courage and energy; these
   are talents that you must profit by. This divine Master asks that, for
   the present, you will make your courage consist in patient endurance
   and resignation; but it is in the depths of your soul, not in feeling,
   that He wishes to find this abandonment, and, in His infinite goodness,
   at the same time that He requires it of you, He bestows it upon you.
   For this grace unite with me in returning thanks to Him, for He could
   not have bestowed upon you a more precious gift. Perhaps a day will
   come when this resignation will become sensible, and then it will be as
   sweet, as now it is bitter, and you will enjoy that heavenly unction
   which Jesus Christ has attached to His Cross. This is what makes the
   peace and joy of the saints unchangeable, and it is what those
   experience who follow generously the path of perfection and a spiritual
   life, in sacrificing everything for God. You tell me that with your
   character and temperament it seems to you impossible to acquire a taste
   for the interior life. So it is, truly; but what is impossible to man
   is easy to God, and it is on Him alone, and on His grace through Jesus
   Christ, that you have to depend. In order to compel you to lay a
   foundation of humility in your soul this God of goodness begins by
   making you feel most keenly your own weakness; but, when this feeling
   depresses you, encourage yourself to hope, for God, as you know, is
   pleased to make His grace triumph most in our greatest weaknesses.

   3rd. The petition you so often make interiorly, "Lord, have pity on me,
   You can do all things," is the best and most simple prayer that you
   could possibly make. Nothing more is required to draw down His powerful
   aid. Keep steadfastly to this practice and to the habit of never
   expecting anything from yourself but of hoping to obtain all from God.
   He will do the rest, without your perceiving it, and I feel assured
   that this will be visibly shown by the result. I am interiorly
   convinced that unless prevented by great infidelity on your part, God,
   by His holy operation will perform great things in pour soul. You may
   count upon this, if you do not voluntarily oppose any obstacle. If you
   become aware of having unfortunately done so, humble yourself
   immediately and return to God and to yourself with a perfect confidence
   in the divine goodness.

   4th. We must only attach ourselves to God and to His holy will by
   acquiescing in all His arrangements which cannot fail to be for our
   happiness and profit. If, on our part, there should be nothing else but
   this blind submission to His good pleasure, we ought to be contented,
   because in this alone consists all perfection, and the true love of
   God.

   5th. It is a great grace to realise the folly and extravagance of the
   pleasures that worldly people pursue so eagerly. From this you will
   derive great good for your soul which, in this contempt for the world
   will find a powerful motive for giving itself entirely to a spiritual
   life. Perhaps you will say that you are still but a novice in this
   life. I acknowledge that, but you admire it, desire it, ask for it, and
   are tending towards it; here are so many different degrees of grace;
   the rest will follow in due time. Meanwhile moderate your spiritual
   vehemence, and your holy ambition.

   6th. You are beginning, you say, to be indifferent as to whether people
   behave well or badly towards you. This is a greater grace than you
   imagine. But there are times, you say, when sadness and discouragement
   seem to overwhelm you. This you must put up with as well as you can,
   and accept the annoyance of finding yourself so weak, for this is most
   irritating to our spiritual self-love. This is the most meritorious of
   all the sacrifices by which we must immolate it, as it is the most
   humiliating. It is quite permissible to expect some sensible help and
   support in the spiritual life, but we must hope for it with moderation,
   seek it without excitement, and make use of it without becoming too
   much attached to it, and lose it when God wishes to deprive us of it, I
   do not say, without pain, but without being voluntarily cast down and
   troubled. Above all it is necessary to make God our principal help, to
   count on Him in default of others, to trust in Him unreservedly, to
   have recourse to Him in all dangers and for everything, as little
   children do with their loving mothers. This holy simplicity, this
   humble and childlike conduct towards God will touch and move His
   paternal heart, and obtain sooner or later all that we ask, or
   something else better for us, which is often given us even without our
   knowledge.

   7th. The complaints made by our Lord to St. Catherine of Siena of the
   exaggerated activity of those souls in saying and doing so much
   themselves, that they left Him not one moment in which to effect
   anything, should be understood in this sense; that in working and
   accomplishing our duties, we should do so without excitement, and
   natural impetuosity, and that, during the day we should listen to the
   voice of divine Wisdom to hear Him who speaks in the centre of our
   hearts without sound of words, because His operation is His word.
   Moreover, that in all our prayers, readings, examens, and thoughts of
   God we should act quietly, gently, without confusion or effort, seeking
   only the union of our hearts with God, and for that making use of
   frequent pauses to give the Holy Spirit of God time to work in us what
   He pleases, and as He pleases.

   8th. All that you tell me about your fear of your faults being rendered
   greater on account of your realisation of the presence of God is an
   illusion of the devil who, in this way tries to withdraw our attention
   from this divine Presence, and to diminish our devotion while we are
   before the most Holy Sacrament. Continue to follow this exercise
   without fear; I see the fruits of it, and they will become so sensible
   that you will see them yourself in course of time.

   9th. I congratulate you that God has taken away some of your natural
   vivacity. The loss of your gaiety will only be temporary. It will
   return, but completely changed, or rather transformed into spiritual
   joy, quiet, tranquil and peaceful, because it will be like that of the
   saints, in God and coming only from God.

   10th. I greatly approve of your method of prayer; continue the same,
   and make acts when you feel inclined. When, during pauses, or interior
   silence some good thought or inclination should be suggested to you,
   receive it quietly; and do the same with interior repose, whether
   sometimes greater or less, as God pleases. In a word, tend always
   towards that sovereign Lord, more by the affections and desires than by
   the mind and intellect; and no matter what He gives you be always
   satisfied. God knows better than we do what is necessary for us; let
   Him act, but let us be absolutely convinced that the least repose of
   heart we enjoy in His holy presence is worth more than anything we
   could say or think ourselves. May this conviction impel you ever more
   strongly to tend with all your heart towards this holy repose; and when
   God gives it to you do not interrupt it, for these are the precious
   moments when the King of kings admits those souls Whom He honours with
   His predilection to a friendly audience.

  Letter XVI.--Sensitiveness about Defects.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux. Sensitiveness
   about defects a sign of self-love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear Sister,

   1st. I thank you for your good wishes, and above all for your prayers.
   I also pray for you every day at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. I
   thank our Lord for the good effect produced in your soul by my letters,
   but you must allow me to remark that I find you still very sensitive
   about the state of misery, poverty, and spiritual weakness to which you
   find yourself reduced. This can only come from a great amount of
   self-love which cannot endure a state of nothingness, and abhors the
   necessity of self-effacement. Nevertheless you must necessarily pass
   through this trial because your mind has to be emptied of self before
   it can be filled by the Spirit of God, and He will make you die to your
   old life, before you are able to begin a new one. What you want is to
   acquire the one without losing the other; this cannot be: have patience
   and preserve a certain peace in the centre of your soul during these
   interior tempests. Your state of obscurity and callousness, to whatever
   degree it may attain, need not alarm you; all that is necessary is to
   submit, and to abandon yourself entirely to God. Do not worry yourself
   to try and feel submissive; feeling has nothing to do with this
   business; it is enough if you are willing to submit, for this is
   practised by the higher part of the soul.

   2nd. You are wrong in finding your weakness a subject for anxiety. As
   long as you have confidence in God, He will sustain you as He has done
   hitherto on the brink of the precipice. Possibly it will be by an
   imperceptible thread, but, in the hand of God, this slight thread is
   like a thick rope.

   3rd. In the painful positions of which you speak there are only two
   things to be done; either to throw yourself in spirit at the feet of
   Jesus Christ, and to kiss those sacred feet, or, if you cannot do that,
   keep an interior silence of submission and adoration, and content
   yourself with an exterior sign, such as, raising your eyes to heaven,
   and then lowering them and bowing your head, remaining thus for a
   little while in union with Jesus Christ in the Garden of Olives. If
   possible, remain ever there, by the side of Jesus Christ humiliated,
   cast down, and annihilated before His Father. I love to see you in
   prayer taking the position of a beggar, of a beast of burden; but still
   more do I love that indescribable something which inwardly draws you on
   without any distinct aim, but with a certain dry repose full of
   aridity. When you get so far, hold on to this state contenting yourself
   with waiting in that peaceful expectation of which I have so frequently
   spoken to you. Again at other times try to make some acts, or to read
   something as quietly as possible and with frequent pauses to give room
   for the interior attraction to act. But always remember that you ought
   to follow the least attraction that draws you interiorly, and to retain
   it peacefully without too much exertion, and without seeking out
   distinct thoughts. This repose in the presence of God, this slight
   recollectedness is of even greater value, and will cause you to make
   more progress than the most sublime thoughts.

   4th. I congratulate you in having, by the help of the grace of God,
   overcome the rebellion and repugnance you felt with respect to your
   office. It is by these difficult victories that solid virtue is
   acquired. All the details you give me about your painful feelings and
   distastes make me see the goodness of God Who desires to destroy in the
   centre of your heart that presumption of which you could never be cured
   without this bitter medicine. These truly diabolical feelings that God
   allows the devil to produce in your soul are an antidote to that much
   more diabolical feeling of pride. Learn from this to allow God to act,
   and to abandon yourself, if it so please Him, to much greater miseries
   and interior humiliations. If He should condemn you to these, He knows
   well how to draw you out of them, with great profit to your soul,
   provided always that you are faithful in calling upon Him with
   confidence out of the depths of your nothingness.

   5th. I think that what you say is true; God wills your humiliation;
   love this state for yourself because it forms some resemblance between
   you and your divine Spouse. This love for and desire of humiliations
   will make you progress more in the ways of God than all the other
   practices together. Try, therefore, to profit by every little occasion,
   and feed your mind on the thought and desire of abjection, just as
   worldly people feed their minds on thoughts and desires of vanity. The
   profound peace that you have begun to experience in the midst of
   humiliations, contempt, and rebuffs, is one of the greatest graces of
   which you have ever spoken to me. If you continue thus a great change
   will be effected in your soul by this means alone.

   6th. As to what regards exterior mortification, follow in everything
   the rules of moderation, discretion and obedience, but make up for what
   they refuse to allow you to do, by interior abnegation in refusing
   yourself the least little desire, the least little pleasure, and the
   least thought which is not of God and for God, rejecting all that is
   useless in order to occupy yourself exclusively with Him. Oh! what a
   joy and triumph for me when I shall see my dear daughters abject like
   Jesus Christ, humbled and annihilated! Do you, therefore, follow the
   grace of this attraction; it will lead you on. I cannot repeat often
   enough that I will never cease praying that God may give you this holy
   love of abjection. About evening devotions; I have neither time nor
   inclination to enter into the subject. Believe me you already have too
   many practices, and must try to simplify matters that relate to the
   soul. Just the presence of God, abandonment to God; just the desire to
   love God, and to be united to Him. These are the most simple exercises,
   and more definite for souls a little advanced in spiritual matters, and
   of far greater importance than any exterior practices.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVII.--Confidence in God.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. Confidence in God is the cure of
   self-love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   When you have neither time nor inclination to read, try to keep
   yourself simply in peace in the presence of God, and do not trouble to
   practise works of supererogation unless by His special intimation and
   impulse, and if they are done with facility. If you seem to be wanting
   in courage for many things, compel yourself at any rate to retain in
   your heart a determination to be all for God. Humble yourself with the
   consideration of the inefficacy of your own resolutions, and look upon
   yourself as having so far done nothing. The less confidence you place
   in yourself, the more easy will it become to have entire confidence in
   the mercy of God alone, through the merits of Jesus Christ. This is
   that solid and perfect confidence which completely annihilates
   self-love by withdrawing all those resources upon which it was
   accustomed to rely. There could be nothing more salutary for some souls
   than this kind of martyrdom.

   You say that some sort of sacrifices lead to God while others do not,
   but rather lead to revolts against Him. This idea is a mistaken one,
   caused by judging of good and evil in matters of devotion, by the
   senses. Some sacrifices which do not touch the heart in a vulnerable
   spot, always afford consolation, and thus lead us sensibly to God; but
   those that wound the heart, poignantly cause so much pain that we are
   greatly troubled, and inclined to break down completely. To the sorrow
   these sacrifices entail is joined another very painful suffering;
   namely, the fear of being unable to bear it, and of gaining nothing by
   it. This it is that produces the false idea that these sacrifices turn
   us away from God. Nevertheless it is an assured principle that the more
   these sacrifices touch us to the quick, and the more they make us die
   to ourselves, and detach us from all consolation, and sensible support,
   the closer they draw us to God and unite us to Him. This union is all
   the more meritorious in being hidden and further out of the range of
   the senses. Self-love, therefore, has no share in it, since it cannot
   feed on what it can neither know nor feel. May God deign to convince
   you of the truth of this consoling assurance, which is the teaching of
   all the Doctors of the Church, and is confirmed by every experience. In
   order to understand it thoroughly you must remember that in almost
   everyone there is such a depth of self-love, weakness and misery, that
   it would be impossible for us to recognise any gift of God in ourselves
   without being exposed to spoil and corrupt it by imperceptible feelings
   of self-complacency. In this way we appropriate as our own the graces
   of God, and are pleased with ourselves for being in such or such a
   state. We attribute the merit to ourselves, not, perhaps, by distinct
   and studied thought, but by the secret feelings of the heart.
   Therefore, God, seeing the innermost recesses of the heart, and being
   infinitely jealous of His glory, is obliged, in order to maintain it,
   and to protect Himself against these secret thefts, to convince us, by
   our own experience, of our utter weakness. It is for this purpose that
   He conceals from us nearly all His gifts and graces. There are hardly
   more than two exceptions to this rule; on the one hand beginners who
   require to be attracted and captured through their senses, and on the
   other hand great saints who, on account of having been purified of
   self-love by innumerable interior trials are able to recognise in
   themselves the gifts of God without the least feeling of
   self-complacency, nor even a glance at themselves. For my part I can
   bear witness to this constant action of divine Providence. God has so
   completely hidden from those who have appealed to me, the gifts and
   graces with which he has loaded them, that they cannot see their own
   progress, nor their patience, humility and abandonment, nor even their
   love of God. Then, too, they can hardly help weeping at the supposed
   absence of these virtues and at their want of generosity in their
   sufferings. However, the more afflicted and full of fear are their
   souls, the less need have their directors to fear and to be afflicted
   on their account. This ought to cure you of making so many difficulties
   for yourself. You would understand this still better, perhaps, if you
   were to consider what Fénélon said on this subject, "There is not a
   single gift so exalted but that after having been a means of
   advancement, cannot become, in the sequel, a snare and an obstacle to
   the soul, by the instinct of possession, which sullies it." On this
   account God withdraws what He had given, but He does not take it away
   to deprive us of it absolutely. He withdraws it to give it back in a
   better way, after it has been purified from this malicious
   appropriation made by us without our perceiving it. The loss of the
   gift prevents this feeling of proprietorship, and this gone, the gift
   is returned a hundredfold. All this seems to me to be of such great
   importance for you that I think you would do well to read it over often
   although it is rather lengthy. By dint of impressing it on your mind
   you will, I hope relinquish those false prejudices, and the many errors
   that so frequently disturb and destroy the peace of your soul. Without
   this peace, as you know, it is impossible to make any progress in the
   spiritual life.

   I am acquainted with a spiritual person who is so convinced of the
   truth of this rule that I have heard her say many times, that after
   having prayed for certain spiritual favours for a very long time, and
   after having had innumerable novenas and prayers offered for the same
   intention she often said to God, "Lord, I consent to be for ever
   deprived of the knowledge as to whether it has pleased You to grant me
   these graces, because I am such a miserable creature that when I know I
   possess a particular grace I immediately convert it into a poison. It
   is not that I wish to do this, Lord, but such is the corruption of my
   heart that this accursed self-complacency spoils all my works almost
   without my knowledge and almost against my will. I feel that it is I
   who tie Your hands, Oh my God! and who oblige You to hide from me in
   Your goodness those graces that Your mercy induces You to bestow upon
   me.

   You, my dear daughter, have more need than anyone else to understand
   these feelings, for I have never hitherto met with anyone who depended
   so much on what is called the sensible help of direction under the
   specious pretext of spiritual need. I have always thought, without
   mentioning it to you, that the time would come when God, desiring to be
   the only support of your soul, would withdraw from you these sensible
   props without even allowing you to learn in what way He could supply
   all that of which He had deprived you. This state I must own is
   terrible to nature, but in this terrible state, one simple "Fiat,"
   uttered very earnestly in spite of the repugnance experienced in the
   soul, is an assurance of real and solid progress. Then there remains
   nothing but bare faith in God, that is to say, an obscure faith
   despoiled of all sensible devotion, and residing in the will, as St.
   Francis of Sales says. Then it is, also, that are accomplished to their
   utmost extent the words of St. Paul when he said, "We draw near to God
   by faith," and "The just man lives by faith." All this ought to
   convince you that it is not in anger but in mercy and in very great
   mercy that God deprives you more than others. It is because He is more
   jealous of the possession of your whole heart and all your confidence,
   and for this reason He is obliged to take away everything and to leave
   nothing sensible either exterior or interior. Therefore, my dear
   Sister, a truce to reflexions on present or future evils. Abandonment!
   Submission! Love! Confidence!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVIII.--Sacrifice and Fidelity.

   To Madame de Lesen after she had become a Religious in the Order of the
   Annunciation. Sacrifice and fidelity are the death of self-love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   You ask me several questions, but what can I say in answer that holy
   books, meditations, preachers, directors, and above all the interior
   spirit have not told you hundreds and hundreds of times?

   1st. Do you not know that it is only very gradually that self-love
   dies, and that we learn to live only in God and for God? This is
   effected by a constant fidelity in carrying out those sacrifices
   demanded by the interior spirit; sacrifices of the mind, of the will,
   of every passion and caprice, of every feeling and affection, in fine
   and above all, the sacrifice of an entire submission in every trial, in
   the perpetual vicissitudes of the soul, and in those sometimes very
   painful states through which we have to pass in order to be entirely
   united to God.

   2nd. Do you know that the state of pure faith excludes all that can be
   sensibly felt? In this state of deprivation progress is made without
   assistance from anything created, but the bare light of faith remains
   always in the highest point of the soul, and by this light we can not
   only see what we ought to do, and what to avoid, but we know also that,
   by the grace of God, we live in horror of evil and fly from it, and in
   the love and practice of virtue. Therefore it is well to say, "I am
   living in perfect confidence, and am not risking my eternity." "But
   suppose I am mistaken, and deceiving others without knowing it?" If you
   do not know it, then you are in good faith, and this will excuse you in
   the sight of God Who is as merciful as He is just. "But in spite of all
   this I still feel very much alarmed." Yes, that cannot be helped; our
   condition in this life is one of fear, because no one can be perfectly
   sure. God wills that we should glorify Him by an abandonment full of
   love and confidence. This is the tribute He most particularly exacts,
   and as He gives us the means of offering it with greater merit, why
   should we be alarmed? We should have more reason to be afraid if we had
   ceased to fear. There is no state that is more suspect than that which
   is devoid of fear, even if it should be accompanied by love and
   confidence. When, on the contrary the fear of offending God is the
   prevailing sentiment, the considerations I have explained ought to be
   sufficient reassurance. They are perfectly solid, because they rest on
   the immutable principles of faith. In default of sensible devotion we
   should attach ourselves to this bare faith preserved by God always in
   the centre of the soul, or the higher point of the spirit.

   3rd. Do you not know that the sensible presence of God is often by its
   sweetness an occasion of satisfying our self-love, and that in order to
   prevent it being dangerous to us God deprives us of it leaving us only
   bare faith devoid of sweetness, or any kind of mental images, figures,
   or representations? "But," you say, "I do not know if I have this
   faith." Well! at any rate you know that you aspire to it continually.
   This desire is, in fact, perhaps too vehement in you, since you are so
   prone to get excited and vexed when you are disappointed. Therefore you
   have, at least, the continual and habitual desire of this divine
   presence. This desire is known to God Who sees the slightest movement
   of the heart. That ought to be enough for you. Remain then in peace,
   confidence, submission, and abandonment, and in grateful love.

   4th. Do you not know that the best preparation for Holy Communion is
   that operated in the soul by God Himself? Approach then with
   confidence, with complete abandonment to the state of poverty and
   deprivation in which it has pleased God to place you. Remain in it as
   though sacrificed, annihilated and unseen like Jesus Christ in His
   Sacrament, because He is there in a kind of annihilation. Unite yours
   to His. Where there is nothing left that is created, or human, there is
   God. The more destitute of all things, and divested of self you become,
   the more will you be possessed by God. Make for yourself a spiritual
   treasure of this very poverty by a continual adherence to the will of
   God. From the time you begin this practice you will become richer than
   any of those who possess the greatest gifts of joy and consolation. You
   will possess the riches of the holy will of God without fear of
   self-complacency, since this holy will is bitter to nature and
   humiliating to pride. Sweet and salutary bitterness which serves as an
   antidote to the poison of self-love and the sting of the serpent of
   pride!

  Letter XIX.--Glorified by Sufferings.

   To Mother Louise-Françoise de Rosen. On the use of trials even if they
   be punishments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Reverend Mother,

   I do not presume to find excuses for the imperfections of the good
   Sister about whom you ask my advice, and since God has taken upon
   Himself the punishment of them by sending her the most cruel trials,
   she seems to me more to be envied on this account than to be blamed for
   her faults. There is much in these faults that deserves the verdict of
   the church on the sin of Adam. "Happy fault which merited so glorious a
   Redeemer!" This good Sister, you tell me, has acknowledged her faults,
   and now, overwhelmed by the weight of her trials, is much more inclined
   to depression than to obstinacy. Therefore you only have to revive her
   courage and to console her gently. Tell her that she has lost nothing,
   and that far from being abandoned by God she is much nearer to Him than
   when all was prosperous with her, and she seemed to succeed in
   everything. I authorise you to tell her from me that I consider her
   more happy than before in consequence of her sufferings by which God is
   purifying her more and more, like gold in the crucible, to unite her
   more closely to Himself. For you must both take into consideration this
   great principle: the extent to which the soul is purified in its most
   secret recesses, is the measure of its union with the God of all
   holiness. By this you can judge if this poor Sister should not be
   considered the happiest of all, if she could be persuaded to look upon
   her state of suffering from this point of view. However, if the
   violence of this trial prevents her seeing clearly the value and use of
   it, let her rely on her faith, and let her glorify God by patience and
   an unreserved submission, abandoning herself entirely to His adorable
   permissions without relaxing in the least degree any of her spiritual
   exercises, especially as regards prayer and Holy Communion; and without
   giving way to a secret desire suggested by self-love, to shake off the
   yoke of the cross of God. "But," she will answer, "this comfort would
   be just if my state were a trial only, but I have every reason to
   believe that it is a punishment inflicted by God." I acknowledge this,
   but in this life no punishment is inflicted by divine justice without a
   loving intention of divine mercy. This is particularly the case with
   those souls whom God most loves. God often permits their faults in
   order to be enabled to derive glory from them, and to make them serve
   for the salvation of these souls. The chastisements He inflicts
   sanctify while humiliating them, and dispose them to unite themselves
   more closely to God, at the same time as they become more detached from
   self. Therefore they are chastisements as well as trials; chastisements
   inasmuch as they atone for the past evil and satisfy divine justice;
   and trials because divine mercy makes use of them to prevent future
   danger, and for the exercise of many very meritorious virtues. You
   cannot insist too strongly on these truths with souls in trouble and
   affliction no matter what may be the cause of their anguish. Let all
   such remember that nothing happens except by the ruling of divine
   Providence, and by His adorable permission. Give this dear Sister who
   is so full of pain the most deeply spiritual reading; this is the only
   means she has to soften and relieve her continual torment, and to make
   it bearable; to convert her pain into profit, and to recover from it at
   the time arranged by divine Providence. God has given me in her behalf,
   all the interest and charity of a spiritual father, and the thought
   never leaves me that the day will come when she will be my joy and my
   crown in the presence of God, and even now visibly before men by a most
   edifying life. I hope she will always keep before her mind the memory
   of the past in order to humble herself before God, and thus to
   establish firmly a solid foundation for the spiritual life in which
   even her faults may prove a guarantee of her perseverance and progress.

  Letter XX.--The Fruit of Trials.

   To the same person on the fruit of trials, Profound Peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. The deep calm you experience, the profound inner peace with which
   you are filled and which you find so sweet, is not an illusion but a
   true operation of the Holy Spirit Who speaks in the centre of your
   soul. Peace and love, says St. John of the Cross, are one and the same.
   Peace can be felt, but love cannot be perceived in the same manner, but
   is very real, nevertheless. I am not surprised that when God deigns to
   bestow these precious gifts upon you, you no longer feel your usual
   infirmities. The interior grace in your soul reflects itself in your
   body, and causes your pains to cease. I know many who find no more
   efficacious means for the cure of their maladies than this quiet
   recollection in God, when He is pleased to bestow it upon them; for, as
   you truly say, it does not proceed from ourselves.

   2nd. To remain simply in the presence of God, quite abandoned to His
   love and mercy is also an effect of the Holy Spirit in the soul. You
   have but to remain humbly and simply in the hands of God, adhering to
   Him, and giving yourself up to His love, so that He may do with you,
   and in you all that He pleases. But never make this sweet repose your
   object; always go further and aim at the possession of Him Who bestows
   it upon you; and value it only as a means of uniting you more closely
   to God Who is your centre, your life, and your all. Never forget that
   you may, possibly, find yourself bereft of everything in the most
   complete spiritual poverty, and left to the simple practice of bare
   faith for the extinction of self-love. This death of self hardly ever
   occurs without a deprivation of all things, and at the mere thought of
   this one's very nature shudders. It is then that one seems lost indeed,
   without any support, and left in the most cruel abandonment.

   3rd. I am glad that God has lessened the fear of reprobation by which
   you were tormented. Now you can, without so much difficulty, abandon
   yourself, by making the following act. "May God do with me whatever He
   pleases, I wish to belong entirely to Him by loving and serving Him as
   well as I can. He is the God of my heart, the God of my salvation, and
   my salvation cannot be left in more secure keeping. I abandon it to Him
   with the greatest confidence." Abandonment by itself can give us an
   assurance of security that self-love seeks unsuccessfully from
   creatures or from self. Our weakness and blindness are much more
   calculated to make us tremble; and, when we enter into ourselves we
   find what would cause us to despair unless we remembered with
   confidence the infinite goodness of God. Therefore we can only be
   reassured through Jesus Christ, in Him; and we find Him proportionately
   to the measure in which we abandon ourselves.

   4th. The simple "Fiat" you pronounce comprises everything, and the
   feeling of your continual dependence is one of the greatest of God's
   graces. The thought of His paternal love and all-powerful aid is the
   reward of it. When the heart is animated by filial confidence it
   becomes easy to receive no matter what from the hands of this most
   merciful Father.

   5th. Pure love without any admixture of interest or self-love can only
   come to you from God, but to acquire a gift of such infinite value the
   soul is obliged to endure many deprivations and trials. These are so
   many operations necessary for its purification, because we are always
   prone to become attached to the pleasure that God allows us unless
   taught by sad experience to love Him even in the most terrible state of
   privation. I am delighted to hear that the interior spirit reigns in
   your community. If holy recollection does not comprise everything it
   is, at any rate, the way to acquire all. You are quite right to leave
   out all those compliments and ordinary good wishes for the New Year as
   far as I am concerned. God sees that they are in your heart where they
   form a continual prayer on my behalf, just as my wishes for your
   welfare are as a prayer in the sight of God. "Our desires," says St.
   Augustine, "are as regards God, what our speech and words are with
   regard to men." He hears them, and, we may hope, will answer them.

  Letter XXI.--Things Painful to Nature.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil (1731). Things painful to nature
   are good for the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You need not to remind me to pray for you. I never forget to do so,
   especially since I became aware that you are in a state so painful to
   nature, although so good for your soul. However, I assure you I have
   never thought of asking God to grant you anything but patience,
   submission, resignation to His holy will, and total abandonment to His
   kind providence; and I do this through the conviction I have of the
   great grace God is giving you, and the great need you are in of these
   virtues; a need all the greater because you do not acknowledge it. When
   this storm is past you will understand these two things so keenly and
   distinctly that you will not know how, sufficiently, to thank God for
   having been so good as to put His own hand to the work, and to operate
   within your soul in a few months, what with the help of ordinary grace
   would have taken you, perhaps, twenty years to accomplish, namely, to
   get rid of a hidden self-love, and of a pride all the more dangerous in
   being more subtle and more imperceptible. From this poisonous root
   grows an infinite number of imperfections of which you are scarcely
   conscious; useless self-examinations, still more useless
   self-complacency, idle fears, fruitless desires, frivolous little
   hopes, suspicions unfavourable to your neighbour, little jokes at her
   expense, and airs full of self-love. You would have run a great risk of
   remaining for a long time subject to all these defects, filled, almost
   without suspecting it, with vanity and self-confidence without either
   power or will to sound the profound abyss of perversity and natural
   corruption that you had within your soul. It is this collection of
   miseries that God now makes you feel, not in particular, for if you
   experienced them in this way one by one, it would not affect you, but
   by viewing them in general, in a heap, and in a confused manner. This
   mass of imperfections is like an overwhelming weight. Do not search
   your conscience, therefore, for the great sin that you imagine must be
   there; what is actually there is still more alarming, and this is a
   chaotic mass of interior miseries, weakness, imperfections, and little
   faults which are almost imperceptible and continual and are produced by
   that amount of self-love of which I am speaking. God has given you a
   great grace in giving you light to recognise this, for never would you
   have been able to discover it yourself, not even from its consequences,
   being in this respect as blind and callous as are vicious men in regard
   to certain gross sins the habit of which renders them hardened to their
   gravity. You also were unconscious of that leaven of corruption that
   was within you and which spoilt and poisoned all your works, even those
   which had their origin in grace.

   The heavenly Physician has therefore treated you with the greatest
   kindness in applying an energetic remedy to your malady, and in opening
   your eyes to the festering sores which were gradually consuming you, in
   order that the sight of the matter which ran from them would inspire
   you with horror. No defect caused by self-love or pride could survive a
   sight so afflicting and humiliating. I conclude from my knowledge of
   this merciful design that you ought neither to desire nor to hope for
   the cessation of the treatment to which you are being subjected until a
   complete cure has been effected. At present you must brace yourself to
   receive many cuts with the lancet, to swallow many bitter pills, but go
   on bravely, and excite yourself to a filial confidence in the fatherly
   love which administers these remedies. Humble yourself under the mighty
   hand of God, annihilate yourself without ceasing and allow this work to
   be accomplished. Do not lose sight for one moment of the contempt and
   horror of yourself with which your present state inspires you. Think
   only of your infidelities and ingratitude. When you look at yourself
   let it not be in the flattering mirror of self-love, but in the
   truth-telling one that God, in His mercy, presents to your eyes to show
   you what you really are. This sight so frequently presented produces a
   forgetfulness of self, humility, and respect for your neighbour. "Come
   and see," the Holy Spirit says to you, which means, come to our Lord
   and behold by that new light with which He has enlightened you what you
   have been, what you are, and what you would, infallibly, have become.
   Be careful never to give up prayer and Holy Communion, for it is in
   these that you find help and defence. As for sin, you do not commit
   any, at any rate, none that are serious. As long as you fear, as you do
   now, to offend God, this fear should reassure you; it is a gift from
   that same hand which invisibly supports you in your trials. Have
   patience! you will be consoled in good time, and your consolation will
   last, while the time of trial passes very rapidly. Poor human nature in
   its dislike of suffering looks longingly for the end. The important
   matter is to gather the fruit of the Cross. Let us pray, then, and sigh
   for that power which we do not possess and should never find within
   ourselves. This is a fundamental truth of which you have an entire
   conviction based on your own experience; and it is for this reason that
   God prolongs your trial until you become so thoroughly convinced that
   the memory of it may never be effaced from your mind. You speak of pure
   love; no soul has ever yet attained to it without having passed through
   many trials and great spiritual labour. In order to arrive at this
   much-desired goal you must learn to love those labours which alone can
   lead you to it. The more generous you are the sooner the end of these
   trials will come and the more fruit will they produce.

   Continue your way, then, courageously. Rejoice every time you discover
   a new imperfection. Look forward to the happy moment in which the full
   knowledge of this abyss of misery completes within you the destruction
   of all self-confidence and foolish self-satisfaction. Then will it be
   that, flying in horror from the putrefaction of this tomb you will
   enter with joyful transports the bosom of God. It is after having
   completely cast off self that God becomes the sole thought, the only
   joy; that on Him alone you will rely, and that nothing will give you
   any pleasure out of Him. This is the new life in Jesus Christ, this is
   the life of the new man after the old has been destroyed. Hasten then
   to die like the caterpillar, so that you may become like a beautiful
   butterfly, flying in the air, instead of crawling on the ground as you
   have hitherto done.

FIFTH BOOK

    FRESH TRIALS, SUFFERINGS AND PRIVATIONS.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter I.--Rules to be Observed in Illness.

   On illness and its uses. Rules to be observed. To Sister Marie-Thérèse
   de Vioménil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister and very dear daughter in our Lord,

   The peace of Jesus Christ be always with you. Do not fear that your
   illness will be a danger to your soul, but, on the contrary, be
   reassured that you will derive great profit from it, because:--

   1st. To suffer peacefully and patiently without any resistance is to
   suffer well, although you may not make any express and energetic acts
   of acceptance. The heart by submitting, and by a humble and simple
   acquiescence offers them passively.

   2nd. Also, my dear Sister, you ought to thank God as for a grace, in
   that you suffer in a feeble and small way; that is to say without
   feeling much courage and as if you were overwhelmed by your illness and
   on the point of losing patience, of complaining, and giving way to the
   revolts of nature. Yes, it is a grace and a signal grace, because to
   suffer thus is to suffer with humility and lowliness of spirit;
   whereas, if one felt a distinct courage and strength, a conscious
   resignation, the heart would swell with satisfaction, and one would
   become filled with self-confidence and spiritual pride and presumption.
   In your state, on the contrary, you feel weak before God, humbled and
   confounded at suffering in so feeble a manner. This is a certain truth,
   very consoling, very spiritual, and very little recognised. Remember
   it, then, on all occasions when, feeling more keenly the weight of the
   Cross and of your sufferings you feel at the same time your weakness,
   and submit in peace and simplicity in the centre of your soul to all
   that God wills. This way of suffering is most sanctifying, and is what
   Fénèlon calls becoming little in your own eyes and humbling yourself
   with the knowledge of how wanting you are in courage to suffer. If all
   people of good will understood this truth they would be able to suffer
   in peace and simplicity, without being distressed and wounded in their
   self-love by finding themselves so helpless and with so little courage
   to bear their sufferings. You should apply this rule to all your
   afflicting trials, and especially to those daily annoyances you
   experience from the person who worries you, and also when you have
   feelings of antipathy towards anyone else.

   3rd. As regards the alleviations you might find beneficial; certainly
   those officious persons who imagine they cannot do better to show their
   charity to the sick than by raising in their minds all sorts of
   longings are, as you remark, not to be accounted charitable; their
   flattering conversations are so many snares; at the same time you ought
   to take, without scruple, humbly and in holy simplicity, all that the
   doctors, superiors, and infirmarians order. Obedience and giving up our
   own will which we practise in acting thus are much more agreeable to
   God than any bodily mortification. This is another truth that many
   devout persons lose sight of, and are consequently very unmortified
   even in their mortifications. Do not forget this, because self-love and
   following your own will would spoil everything, corrupt everything,
   even in practices that are very holy in themselves. Oh! how happy
   should we be if we could once for all renounce our own will, judgment
   and ideas for the love of God!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter II.--Different Sufferings.

   On sufferings of different kinds.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   The sufferings about which you ask my direction are of different kinds.
   There are great trials, and the vexations of daily occurrence. These,
   on account of their multiplicity form the chief part of our treasure if
   we only know how to take advantage of them. Believe me, inasmuch as it
   depends on our own efforts it is necessary to bear the little crosses
   we encounter every day, for by them God will enable us to destroy our
   self-love. Oh! how happy should we be if we could but get rid of this
   accursed vanity which embitters us and irritates us about every trifle,
   makes us commit a thousand faults, and do ourselves great harm by the
   constant annoyance and interior trouble it causes us. Even should the
   occasion present itself of having to endure still greater sufferings,
   remember that they will pass like everything else, and that when they
   are over we can have no consolation in having borne them badly, and in
   having derived no advantage from them. On the other hand what a great
   satisfaction it will be to have made a virtue of necessity. To do this
   do not speak more than is necessary about them, and then in as few
   words as possible; do not make a fuss about them, or about the pain
   they cause you; abandon all to divine Providence who will make
   everything conduce to your profit if you live by faith. I pray God to
   make you well understand the great spiritual fruit, and the temporal
   blessings derived from the holy practice of entire resignation to the
   holy will of God in all things, and from total abandonment to all that
   He permits, recognising that without this divine permission not a hair
   can fall from our heads, nor a leaf in Autumn from all the innumerable
   trees of the forests. This is of faith. Could Jesus Christ have more
   clearly expressed than by these words, that there is no event, great or
   small, in the world which has not been expressly arranged by the
   sovereign providence of God? Oh my God! how consoling this is, and how
   easily we could cast off all our cares if, according to Your own words
   we could learn to look upon You as a loving Father, and upon ourselves
   as Your children, and to remember that You never show us more love than
   when You make us take bitter remedies for our cure! Have pity, Father
   of infinite goodness, on those who are sick, who, in their delirium
   turn against You, their good Physician, and refuse the medicine which
   is intended to procure them health and life.

   Oh my God! how many blind and senseless people there are in the world
   who will not even listen to these truths although You have revealed
   them in the sacred Scriptures for our present consolation and our
   future salvation!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter III.--On Public Calamities.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On public calamities and
   disasters.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The disaster of which you speak is, as you say, a most visible scourge
   of God; happy will they be who take advantage of it to save their
   souls. These punishments, borne well, as from the hands of God, are of
   more value than all worldly prosperity. At the same time they may be
   made, by a bad use, the occasion to some of eternal reprobation. This
   will be, however, entirely by their own fault, and their very great
   fault, for what could be more reasonable, or easier in a sense than to
   make, as I said before, a virtue of necessity? Why make a useless and
   criminal resistance to the chastisements of God, Who is our Father and
   Who strikes us only to detach us from the miserable pleasures of this
   world? Could He do us a greater favour than to deliver us from
   attaching ourselves to that which would cause us to lose eternal
   happiness and our own souls! On such occasions it is well to think
   often and attentively of this passage in the writings of one of the
   Fathers of the Church. "Such is the goodness of our heavenly Father
   that even His anger proceeds from His mercy, since He only strikes us
   to withdraw us from sin, and to save us." Like a wise surgeon He cuts
   the mortified flesh away from that which is sound to save the life of
   the patient, and to prevent the infection from spreading. We should
   accustom ourselves to see everything in the light of faith; and then no
   event of this life, nor desires, nor fears will have any effect on us.
   Those strong hopes that so frequently upset the peace of the soul and
   the tranquil course of life, even those will make very little
   impression on us. How blind men are! and how much attached to their own
   ideas! How rarely one meets with anyone who will own that he has been
   obliged to seek and to take good advice! St. Francis of Sales had good
   reason to say that we are all wanting in sense. At least let us
   understand the depth of the misery and blindness into which sin has
   caused us to fall. Let us learn from this to be always distrustful of
   ourselves, and to guard against our own judgments and perverse ideas.
   St. Catherine of Siena was so convinced of the truth of this that she
   wished she could cry out constantly in a way to be heard by everyone:
   "Lord help me, come to my assistance and have pity on me!" Do not
   forget in future that a simple "Fiat" with regard to your present
   pains, and to those which you fear in the future either for yourself,
   or for others, will suffice to amass for you a treasure of peace even
   on earth. If this practice does not bring perfect peace immediately, it
   will, at least, fill your soul with joy and enable you to taste a solid
   consolation in all your pains and fears.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IV.--Opportunities for Practising Charity.

   On contradictory tastes and characters.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Far from pitying you I consider that you are more to be congratulated
   on having, at last, an opportunity of practising true charity. The
   antipathy you feel towards the person with whom you have such continual
   intercourse, the difference in your ideas and tastes, the offence she
   causes you by her manners and conversation are so many infallible signs
   that the charity you show her is purely supernatural and without any
   admixture of human feeling. This will be a way of amassing pure gold,
   and it depends entirely on yourself whether or not you will heap up an
   immense treasure. Be grateful, therefore, to the good God and in order
   to lose nothing of the inestimable advantages of your present position
   follow out exactly the rules that I will now give you.

   1st. Bear patiently the involuntary feelings of disgust that this
   Sister's behaviour causes you, just as you would bear a sudden attack
   of fever or megrim. Your antipathy is really, in fact, an interior
   fever, with its shivering and paroxysms. This is very crucifying,
   humiliating and painful, consequently is more meritorious and
   sanctifying.

   2nd. Never speak, as perhaps the others do, about this Sister unless to
   speak kindly about her, remembering that she has her good qualities.
   And which of us is without bad ones? Who is perfect in this world? It
   is possible that without your will or knowledge you are as great a
   trial to her as God allows her to be to you. God often polishes one
   diamond by friction with another, says Fénélon.

   3rd. When you have committed some fault in this matter do not distress
   yourself but humble yourself quietly without voluntary vexation either
   with her or yourself, without anxiety, annoyance or uneasiness. If we
   treat our faults in this way they will be to our profit and advantage.
   God keeps us in a state of true humility by these miseries, and the
   daily faults by which we discover our own pettiness.

   4th. For the rest, unless your duty obliges you, do not meddle in
   anything that is said or done, let everything go on without speaking or
   thinking about it. Abandon all to divine Providence. What does it
   matter if everything goes, if everything perishes, provided that we
   belong to God and save our souls? But, I almost hear you say, if such
   or such a thing should happen what shall I do? This! I will take no
   notice, I will have nothing to do with it, because I should be sorry to
   lose this happy state of abandonment which makes me live in complete
   and absolute dependence on God from day to day, hour to hour, moment to
   moment, without a thought of the future, nor even of to-morrow.
   To-morrow will take care of itself. He who sustains us to-day with His
   invisible hand, will sustain us tomorrow. The manna in the desert was
   only given from day to day, and whoever, through want of confidence, or
   a false wisdom, gathered it up for the next day, found it spoilt. Let
   us not in our anxious and ignorant foresight make unnecessary provision
   for ourselves, when God in His wisdom and foreknowledge provides for
   us. Let us depend entirely on His fatherly care and abandon ourselves
   to it utterly both for our temporal concerns and our spiritual and
   eternal interests. This is true and total abandonment which binds God
   to take all under His care with respect to those who abandon all and
   thus pay that honour to His sovereign dominion, His power, wisdom,
   goodness and mercy that is due to all His infinite perfections. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter V.--Profit to be gained by Patient Endurance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You have reason to bless God, my dear Sister, for having preserved in
   your heart peace, gentleness, and charity for the person whose place it
   is to wait upon you. He has given you a great grace. Perhaps He may
   still allow that, either through ignorance, thoughtlessness, or even,
   if you will, out of caprice, or bad temper, she may give you occasion
   to practise patience. Then, Sister, try to profit well by these
   precious occasions which are so adapted to gain the heart of God. Alas!
   we offend this God of all goodness not only through ignorance and
   thoughtlessness, but deliberately and maliciously. We want Him to
   forgive us, and this He most mercifully does, and then we will not
   forgive others like ourselves. And we recite every day the prayer our
   Lord taught us, "Forgive us, Lord, as we forgive." We must remember
   also the words of our God, telling us that He would act towards us as
   we act towards our neighbour; therefore we ought to bear with our
   neighbour, and to show him consideration, charity, gentleness and
   condescension; and God Who is faithful to His promises will treat us in
   like manner. I am enlarging on this subject a little because it will
   give you occasion to practise the greatest and most solid virtue every
   day; charity, patience, meekness, and humility of heart, benignity and
   the renunciation of your own ideas; and these little daily virtues
   faithfully practised will procure you a rich harvest of graces and
   merits for eternity. It is in this way better than in any other that
   you will be able to obtain the great gift of interior prayer, peace of
   mind, recollection, the continual presence of God, and His pure and
   perfect love. This simple cross borne patiently will draw down upon you
   an infinitude of graces, and will enable you more efficaciously to
   become detached from self than trials, in appearance much more
   grievous, and to attach yourself unreservedly to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VI.--Difficulties.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On different kinds of
   difficulties.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   How can you still feel surprised at that of which your experience ought
   to have convinced you for a long time past? As long as we live upon
   earth, and do not live among saints we shall always require patience to
   put up with each other. It is a good thing for us that such is the
   case, so that we may have more frequent opportunities of practising the
   most meritorious virtues; charity, humility, and self-renunciation. Let
   us then resign ourselves with a good grace to this necessity, let us
   try to profit by the faults of our neighbour and be indulgent towards
   them, and by our own faults and rise speedily from them. This is the
   only way to keep peace. I acknowledge that your habitual position is
   extremely hard, but then what a fund of merits for Heaven! what a
   magnificent opportunity of doing penance, and of practising heroic
   virtue! You can hardly fail, if it lasts, to attain in a short time,
   the grace of an interior life, if you continue to practise abnegation,
   and self-renunciation by charity, humility, resignation and abandonment
   to God. These acts of virtue will soon make your heart ready to receive
   the sweet infusion of divine love; and therefore I should feel very
   much disappointed on your account if you were given an easier and more
   agreeable post. These trials of which you complain were valued and
   sought for by the saints with eagerness, because they understood their
   worth and advantages for the reformation of the soul, and far arriving
   at true union with God. You have, for a long time past, been attacked
   by a temptation all the more dangerous the less you suspected its
   danger. This comes from never having rightly understood this truth,
   which is an article of faith, that everything that happens in the
   world, with the sole exception of sin, comes directly from God, and the
   ordinance of His will. Also further, although it is certain that God
   never wills sin, nor consequently the calumnies, persecutions and
   injustices of which His elect are the victims; He wills the
   consequences, nevertheless; that is to say, that He wills that His
   elect should endure calumny, persecutions, humiliations, and often
   martyrdom in a thousand different ways. I say the same of the
   consequences of our own sins. A man, by his own imprudence, or even by
   more culpable means, falls into poverty, illness, and all sorts of
   severe afflictions. God, while detesting the sin, wills its
   consequences, such as poverty, illness and misfortune. This man then
   can, and ought to say, "Lord, I have thoroughly deserved this, You have
   permitted it, it happens by Your will, may Your holy will be done, I
   acquiesce in all. I adore and submit."


   It was the knowledge of this great principle which made holy Job say,
   "The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name
   of the Lord." He did not say, "The Lord hath given, and the devil hath
   taken away," because the devil has no power to do so without the
   permission of God, and it was from this principle that he drew his
   perfect submission, constancy, and peace of mind.

   For want of being thoroughly imbued with this great principle, you have
   never known how to submit to certain conditions and events, nor,
   consequently to remain in them firmly and tranquilly according to the
   will of God. The devil has always tempted you, made you uneasy and
   deceived you by a hundred illusions and false arguments about them. Try
   then, I beg of you in the interests of your salvation and peace of
   mind, to put an end to such a mistake; you will, at the same time put
   an end to the vexations you feel, and to all the rebellious feelings of
   your nature. For this end accustom yourself to make acts of faith and
   submission about every event that happens either through the agency of
   men or the malice of the devil or your own fault, and even your sins.
   God has permitted it thus. He is Master, may He be blessed in all, and
   may His holy will be accomplished in all things. Fiat! Fiat!

   Your situation is very painful, it is true, but on that account it is
   very sanctifying and is the best penance you could possibly perform,
   being assured that it is imposed on you by God Himself. All that the
   evil presents to your mind to the contrary is an evident illusion to
   deprive you of the peace of God, to make you sad, uneasy and vexed;
   always discontented with your present state, and sighing for some
   other. This is why so many in the world are as unhappy as they are
   culpable, for want of being able to understand this truth, so important
   and so consoling, of which I have just reminded you. How many torments
   would they not spare themselves, and how much merit would they not
   amass in the midst of their trials if they could but persuade
   themselves that God makes use of all things for His glory and for the
   benefit of His creatures; and that it remains for them to derive profit
   from all by a blind submission which must be total, general, without
   exceptions and without contrary arguments, at any rate, none that are
   deliberate. If I could but inscribe this truth on your mind and heart
   even with my blood! But God will do so Himself gradually I am sure, if
   you will but co-operate with His grace by rejecting at once all
   thoughts contrary to it. Once more I entreat you to submit in spite of
   all repugnance and disgust to the secret decrees of this adorable
   Providence, and you will become holy and pleasing to God.

  Letter VII.--Rules for Difficult Circumstances.

   To the same person. On the same subject. Rules to be followed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I own, my dear Sister, that there is nothing more difficult than to
   keep a perfect evenness of temper and an immovable patience amid
   domestic difficulties and intercourse with those persons of different
   character by whom we are surrounded. The constant friction makes it
   almost impossible for us not to forget ourselves occasionally; but if
   one falls one moment, one can rise immediately. To fall is a weakness,
   to rise, a virtue. If one loses hold on oneself it is but to gain a
   firmer hold without feeling annoyed, and little by little God gives all
   to those who know how to wait patiently. But you want everything with
   impetuosity and imagine you are going to become perfect at once. You
   must try to moderate by degrees the turbulence and agitation of these
   desires which clash with each other at the risk of being broken.
   However, if you cannot altogether prevent this collision you must try
   to endure it quietly and humbly, and not increase the misery uselessly
   by tormenting yourself because you are tormented. The difficulties that
   are caused you, and the injustice of certain people towards you are, I
   own, the most revolting thing in the world, my heart is troubled with
   only reading about it; but what other remedy is there than the one we
   have already made use of for the cure of many other ills?--to raise our
   eyes to heaven and to say, "Lord, it is Your will, You permit this to
   happen, I adore and I submit. May Your holy will be done. Your divine
   permission will help me to carry this cross in expiation of my sins,
   and to make me merit heaven. Fiat! fiat!"

   If I knew a better remedy I would impart it to you, but as I am certain
   that this is the most efficacious you must excuse me trying to find
   others. I own that it is next to impossible not to give way on such
   occasions to some slight movements of impatience, revolt, and
   bitterness, at any rate, interiorly; but you must return as quickly as
   you can to God and to yourself by humbling yourself quietly without too
   much trouble, and asking earnestly of God the necessary patience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VIII.--Annoyances caused by Good People.

   To the same person. On annoyances caused by good people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. The annoyances you have experienced must have been all the more
   painful as coming from people from whom you would least expect them;
   but be assured that you will have gained great merit for heaven by
   them. Men's ideas are so different; they vary according to their
   interests or temper, and each is convinced of his own sense, and that
   he has right on his side. Oh men! men! To what have we come? What an
   abyss of humiliation for the whole human race! It is a good thing to
   have arrived at the bottom of this abyss, for it will be more easy to
   place all one's confidence in God. The mind, enlightened by faith,
   disposes the heart to submit to the decrees of divine Providence who
   permits good people to make each other suffer to detach them from each
   other. On occasions such as these we can only resign ourselves, and
   abandon ourselves to God who will support us. These dispositions will
   enable us to turn a deaf ear to arguments that might tend to disturb
   us. Whether we consider ourselves, or the conduct of others towards us
   there will never be wanting specious reasons for becoming vexed and
   uneasy. But there is never any reason for depression and worry. These
   irregular emotions are always contrary to reason as well as to
   religion; and the peace of which they deprive us is of incalculably
   more value than that for which we sacrifice it.

   2nd. For the rest it is always allowable to speak in confidence to a
   director, to obtain consolation, strength, and instruction, but always
   do so with charity and discretion. Nevertheless it is better and more
   perfect to keep silence. It is to God alone that we should confide our
   vexations, and tell all as to a friend, or director worthy of our
   entire confidence. This is an excellent and easy way of praying, and is
   called the prayer of confidence, and the outpouring of the heart before
   God. By it is gained great spiritual fortitude, and from it proceeds
   consolation, peace and courage. If you continue to live as you are
   doing now, very imperfectly no doubt, but with a sincere desire to
   improve, and with efforts proportioned to your weakness, our salvation
   is certain. Even the fear you feel about it is a gift of God provided
   it does not go so far as to trouble you, and to prevent you frequenting
   the Sacraments, practising virtue, or continuing your spiritual
   exercises. As for the hardness of heart and want of feeling that you
   complain about, be patient and offer this affliction to God in a spirit
   of penance as you offer Him your illnesses and bodily infirmities.
   Those of the soul are much harder to bear and consequently more
   meritorious.

  Letter IX.--How to Bear these Trials.

   To the same Sister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I feel keenly, my dear Sister, the painful nature of the trial to which
   God has subjected you, and the sadness of your heart at receiving these
   daily wounds. It is true, I own, that it is necessary to be very holy
   to be able to let such things pass unnoticed, without feeling any kind
   of resentment; but, if you cannot attain such perfection yet, try at
   least during these times of trial, first to dismiss as far as you are
   able, all those thoughts, feelings and that language likely to embitter
   your mind; secondly if you cannot succeed in doing this, at any rate,
   say interiorly in the superior part of your soul, "My God, You have
   permitted this, may Your adorable will and divine decrees be
   accomplished in all things. I sacrifice to You this affliction and its
   consequences according to what pleases You. You are the Master, may You
   be blessed by all and in all things." Then add, "I forgive, Lord, from
   the bottom of my heart for the love of You the persons who cause my
   sufferings, and to show the sincerity of my feelings about them I ask
   for them all sorts of graces and blessings, and every happiness." When
   the heart is inclined to resist say, "My God, You see my misery, but at
   least I desire to have all these feelings and I beg this grace of You."
   Having done this think no more about it, and if uncharitable feelings
   still molest you be resigned to endure this torment in conformity to
   the divine Will which permits it, contenting yourself with renewing the
   offering in the higher part of the soul. This is one of the ways by
   which we can share the chalice of Jesus Christ, our good Master.

     __________________________________________________________________

   I am surprised, my dear Sister, that with the help of the rules I have
   so often given you, you are not even yet able to recognise the hand of
   God in the misunderstandings that arise among people with the best
   intentions. "God," you say, "does not inspire anything that brings
   trouble." That, in one sense, is true, but is it not also true that God
   has permitted, and often permits His servants to be given to mistakes
   and illusions which are intended to try them, to exercise them, and, in
   this way to sanctify them by the trouble they cause each other? We see
   hundreds of examples of this in the lives of the saints, and again
   quite recently in the lives of St. Francis Regis, and the venerable
   Sister Marguérite-Marie Alacoque. [3] Try to judge, not by human
   judgment, weak, narrow, and blind as it is, but by divine judgment
   which alone is upright, sure, and infallible. In this way you will
   improve, and not have the peace of your mind and heart disturbed.

  Letter XI.--To Seek God's Help Alone.

   To the same Sister. On the deprivation of human assistance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You think yourself greatly to be pitied, my dear Sister, because God
   has deprived you of the helps that up to now He has contrived for you.
   You are indeed to be pitied, but only on account of your want of
   resignation to the arrangements of divine Providence. Is it not
   deplorable that a soul chosen by God, and which He had taken into His
   service and overwhelmed with graces, instead of being contented with
   Him, ardently sighs after the little helps it receives from fellow
   creatures? These helps are all very well if God allows them, but when
   He takes them away, how much better it would be to rely upon Him alone!
   With what joy a soul that truly loved Him would repeat over and over
   again, "My God, You are my all! Lord! I have only You, but You are
   enough for me, and I desire nothing but what You give me." The almighty
   hand of God will then take the place of a weak and worthless reed in
   regard to this soul. With this certainty how can you possibly consider
   yourself unhappy and abandoned? That which terrifies you is, that in
   future you can have no advice until too late. For my part I must say
   that, after so much advice and so many letters from the most
   enlightened directors you ought to be able to advise others. Besides,
   even though in certain circumstances you should have a serious doubt,
   is that any reason to despair? Raise your heart to God and He will not
   refuse to guide you when all other guidance is taken away from you; and
   then choose, unhesitatingly, what you believe, in good faith, to be the
   most suitable, the most useful to souls, and the most in conformity
   with the Will of God. Whatever may be the result, you must believe that
   you have acted rightly because, under the circumstances, you could not
   have done better. Do you really think that God demands impossibilities?
   No! God, Who is infinitely good, loves straightforwardness and
   simplicity, and is satisfied when we have done all in our power after
   having asked with confidence for His divine light.

   You tell me that in your isolated condition you can see nothing that is
   not a subject of trouble and affliction. Oh! what a grace is this! It
   should have produced, or will necessarily produce in you, a complete
   detachment from all created things. Does not God give such a grace only
   to those souls He most loves? Oh! daughter of little faith, but
   daughter beloved of God, complain after this if you dare! "Only God,"
   you say again, "can know all that I suffer." If you are not
   exaggerating, I congratulate you with all my heart. It was thus that
   the blessed Mother St. Teresa spoke during her great spiritual
   difficulties. It is a good sign to find life sad and bitter. Death is
   terrifying because of the judgment that follows: but unless this terror
   causes disquiet, it comes from the Holy Spirit. I should fear much for
   anyone who did not feel this salutary dread.

  Letter XII.--God Alone.

   To the same Sister. On the absence of a director.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister, I am neither angry nor surprised at what you feel about
   the departure of your director. If, instead of allowing yourself to be
   cast down by this feeling, you could master it, it would be the
   occasion of the most meritorious acts of abandonment to God. Thus you
   would gradually become detached from creatures, and unite yourself to
   Him, Who alone is your sovereign good. Oh! what a joy! what safety as
   to the future life and unchangeable peace for the present to be in God
   alone, to have no other treasure, no other support, no other help or
   hope but God alone! I wish I could send you a beautiful letter that one
   of your Sisters has written to me on the subject. She says that, for a
   whole month this thought, "God alone, I have only God," gave her so
   much consolation and support, that instead of regret, she felt full of
   peace and an inexplicable joy. It seemed to her that God took the place
   of director, and that in future He would correct and instruct her
   Himself. It was to Him I recommended you when I left, and continue to
   do so. This is the farewell that Mother ------ [4] bid me on the eve of
   my departure, "Father, I bid you farewell as this is the will of God."
   That same evening she went to console the other Sisters, and the next
   day held the conference as usual. Since then she has had much to
   suffer, but has done so with a resignation that was worth more than any
   gratification, even spiritual.

  Letter XIII.--Reliance on God Alone.

   To the same Sister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I acknowledge that a visible guide endowed with all the requisite
   qualities for so difficult a position, is a grace of God, and a
   powerful help to the soul. But if Divine Providence should refuse us
   this assistance, or should take it away from us, if we could say with
   our whole heart, "My God, I have only You, You are all that I desire,"
   what we should obtain by doing so, would be worth all that we could
   obtain by means of a director. It is an undoubted fact that God often
   deprives us of all outside help in order that we may give Him our sole
   confidence. Oh! if we would but give it entirely to Him without sharing
   an atom of it with anyone, whoever it might be! how well repaid we
   should find ourselves! For the want of any help from creatures, we
   should experience a great liberty of spirit. If, however, you have such
   contrary feelings it is because you are still very far from having that
   purity of love which makes us seek God for Himself alone. In fact this
   is evident, because the extreme sorrow and trouble to which a soul
   deprived of exterior help abandons itself, can only proceed from an
   immediate attachment to these human helps.

   This attachment excites the jealousy of God, particularly if souls that
   have been favoured behave in this way, as He desires all their
   confidence and affection. But take courage! as God has made you endure
   the severe trial arising from such an attachment, He wishes in this way
   and by means of this very pain to moderate it gradually, until finally
   you are freed from it altogether. Allow Him to effect in you this
   desirable purification, and compel yourself to fulfil His designs
   faithfully. This will be an operation of grace as salutary as it is
   painful. You must endure it patiently as you would endure the suffering
   of some painful remedy intended to cure certain serious complaints.
   However, if you cannot at once succeed in becoming completely detached,
   at least desire with all your strength to become so, and moderate as
   much as you possibly can, the sorrow of which you cannot entirely rid
   yourself. God will do the rest when He thinks fit. Offer yourself to
   Him to do with you as best pleases Him, and show Him simply and humbly
   all your misery and weakness; that will suffice; this good Master asks
   no more at present, because this is all that you can do. Rise quickly
   from your frequent falls, which, as far as this matter is concerned are
   not sins but merely imperfections. For the rest, be satisfied to go to
   confession for the sake of absolution, then go to Communion as usual;
   in other respects your only help will be God. The rules which have been
   given you on former occasions will suffice to guide you, provided that
   you allow God to animate them with His spiritual unction. The more you
   wish for something fresh, the more tormented will you become, and to no
   purpose; and you will also commit many imperfections which will impede
   your spiritual progress just as much as real sins prevent others
   entering the way of salvation. The fear of not knowing, or of passing
   over many interior sins is another temptation of the enemy to deprive
   you of peace, and to disturb you. I command you for God's sake to make
   yourself quite easy in this respect, contenting yourself with
   mentioning in confession that which your conscience tells you is the
   most important. Leave all the rest to the very great mercy of God
   without worrying yourself at all about it. Thus your confessions will
   be unconstrained and peaceful, and in this way will also be very
   fruitful. If we give way to trouble, we derive hardly any fruit from
   our confessions, and this the devil knows very well. If you have any
   difficulty in finding positive sins that you know to be such, just
   mention some particular sin of your past life, and after be at peace.
   This is the usual practice of well-intentioned persons, and you will
   lose nothing by following it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIV.--Abandonment in Trials.

   To the same person. On abandonment in trials of this nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. I always exhort you to be patient and to abandon yourself to God
   because you have need of these virtues. God alone is all, everything
   else is nothing. Attach yourself to Him therefore strongly, entirely
   and resolutely. He has intentions and designs which are not for us to
   fathom. For all our ills there is no other remedy; for all our
   sufferings no other consolation than submission, and complete
   abandonment. This is the most certain way of amassing a fortune for
   eternity and of gaining that true life which will never end.

   2nd. Look upon your ills and infirmities as a very advantageous
   exchange for purgatory where you would have to suffer much more
   severely in the next life, if you did not pay your debts while here on
   earth.

   One simple "fiat" during your exterior and interior pains will be
   enough to make you acquire true sanctity. Remind yourself of what St.
   Francis of Sales said to one of his penitents, "My daughter, repeat
   often during the day, Yes, my heavenly Father, yes, and always yes.'"
   It is a very short and easy practice; nothing further is required to
   attain perfection. We need not go far to attain it, since we can easily
   do so without seeking it outside our own souls.

   3rd. I am much edified by your holy reflexions about the very small
   amount of consolation you find in creatures, and I strongly approve of
   your taking this as a merciful punishment for your over great
   tenderness and excessive affection for your relations and friends. A
   trial endured in such a manner cannot fail to contribute powerfully to
   recall your affections to Him for Whom alone we are created, and apart
   from Whom we can find no repose.

   4th. But I perceive that now, as formerly, the most afflicting trial
   you have to endure is the deprivation of all outward help for your
   soul. I have often told you, and again repeat, that although it is true
   that this help is a grace from God, yet, I maintain that, with regard
   to some people and certain characters, the withdrawal of this support
   is in the end a still greater grace, and a most efficacious means of
   sanctification. Listen to me without interruption. When God honours a
   soul by being jealous of its love, the greatest favour He can confer
   upon it is to gradually deprive it of everything that could turn its
   love away from Him; because never would it have sufficient courage and
   strength to detach itself. Now, God has seen that for a long time past,
   after having become detached from all other creatures, you still kept
   an attachment for and a confidence in your spiritual guide. This
   attachment was in no way wrong, most certainly, but it was the same
   sort of feeling that the Apostles had for their divine Master before
   His Resurrection. This jealous God Who aims at being loved purely and
   solely for Himself, cannot endure this sort of division, and therefore
   He has taken away from you the one who shared with Him the affection of
   your heart. This is truly your heaviest cross, because by it you have
   been attacked in that most sensitive spot, your heart, which formerly
   discovered so many ingenious pretexts to render its sorrow justifiable.
   I can hear you say to yourself that you do not regret this deprivation
   on account of the consolation of which it has robbed you, but because
   of the assistance it has given you for your spiritual progress and
   which is now taken from you. A mistake! an illusion of self-love! One
   "fiat" uttered in this sort of privation gains more merit in the sight
   of God than could be acquired by the most beautiful, the most worthy,
   the most consoling direction in the world. "But," say you, "if one were
   guided by a connected course of advice one would not committ so many
   faults." I answer that these faults are less displeasing to God than
   the smallest little attachment, however pure and innocent it may seem,
   and really be fundamentally. Therefore, I cannot sufficiently admire
   the goodness of God Who for many years past has led you by this sort of
   privation to break off in you all, even the least attachment. At
   present He is attacking your body by illness to detach you from
   yourself. He attacks the soul by weariness, disgust, callousness, and
   other troubles to detach you interiorly from all sensible help and
   consolation. If you will but allow Him to act freely in you, you will
   come at last to adhere only to Him by pure faith and in spirit, or, as
   St. Francis of Sales puts it, by the higher faculties of the soul. Let
   this God of all goodness act then, for He desires all your confidence.
   I cannot help adding that the longer I live, the more clearly I see and
   understand that everything depends solely on God, and that if
   everything is left to Him, all will go well. No sooner do I make the
   sacrifice of everything to Him, than all goes perfectly.

   5th. You do well to think that there are others who have much heavier
   crosses than yours, but be careful that the thought of the weight of
   yours does not prevent you being resigned to God. We might very likely
   be deprived of a sensible and consoling submission, but that which
   comes from pure faith and is simply spiritual can never be wanting to
   us. That which is not spoilt by any sort of vain self-complacency is
   very much more meritorious. This is why God gives only this last sort
   of submission to most people, leaving the soul groaning and humbled
   under the weight of its afflictions. God's gifts are according to our
   requirements. He bestows especial graces to enable us to bear
   extraordinary troubles. What we cannot help, patience makes bearable.
   This is what a pagan philosopher said, enlightened only by human
   reason; what then, may not faith and religion make us think and say
   when we look at the crucifix and think of the eternal happiness in
   store for us?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XV.--The Use of Afflictions.

   On the usefulness of those afflictions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   When I consider the infinite value of your present trials I dare not
   wish them to cease; what I do wish is that you should keep yourself in
   a perpetual state of sacrifice and abandonment, or at least to tend
   that way, and to desire and implore it incessantly of God. With this
   disposition, and by making good use of crosses and afflictions, you
   will advance your eternal interests much more rapidly than you would by
   consolations and success. In a short time everything will have an end
   for us, and we shall have a boundless eternity in which to rejoice and
   to return thanks. This thought should completely console us for all our
   pains both interior and exterior, for these will procure us the joys of
   paradise. Let us remember that we have but little time to attain to
   this infinite happiness! and let us try to render ourselves worthy of
   it, at no matter what cost.

   To continue, my dear Sister, I have already pointed out the fruit
   obtained by your soul in the great trial through which God has made you
   pass. In spite of the violent tempests it raised in your soul, I have
   no doubt that it greatly contributed to your spiritual progress. You
   learnt by it how to remain interiorly crucified, to be wearied of
   everything earthly, to make many painful and frequent sacrifices to
   God, to overcome yourself in many ways, to be patient and submissive
   and to abandon yourself to God. "But how," you will ask, "has all this
   been done?" It has been done by means of troubles, reverses, and
   feelings of utter repugnance; by the higher faculties of the soul, and
   often without your knowledge, and without your being able to understand
   how you had this submission which you possessed without being aware of
   it. At other times you were persuaded that you did not possess it, and
   hardly desired to have it, while all the time there it was at the
   bottom of your heart! Oh! how admirable are the ways of God! If you had
   known as I did, the depths of your soul, you might, perchance, have
   spoilt all by secret reflexions and vain self-complacency. Let God do
   His work. It is through our ignorance, blindness, and obscurity that He
   can act as He pleases, without having His work spoilt by us. We
   acknowledge this, even by our humiliation when we believe that all is
   going wrong, that all is lost! but it ought to suffice for you to know
   that I see clearly enough the progress you have made to re-assure you,
   to answer for you, and to encourage you! Oh! how I wish that you would
   have more confidence in God, more complete abandonment to His all-wise
   and divine Providence which arranges even the smallest events of our
   lives! He turns them all to the advantage of those who confide
   themselves to Him, and who abandon themselves unreservedly to His
   fatherly care. What peace does not this confidence and entire
   abandonment produce in the soul! and from what uneasy and vexatious
   cares without end does it not deliver us? But as we cannot attain to
   this all at once, but gradually and by imperceptible degrees, we must
   aspire after it without ceasing, ask it of God and make frequent act of
   it. Occasions for doing so will not be wanting; let us avail ourselves
   of them, and repeat constantly, "Yes, my God, since it is Your will and
   You permit it thus to be, I also will it for love of You, help and
   strengthen me." All this quietly, without effort, with the higher
   powers of your soul, and in spite of interior repugnance of which you
   need take no notice, except to bear it patiently and so make a
   sacrifice of it. Let us even wish to make these acts in the midst of
   these repugnances and revolts, since God wills or permits it thus to
   happen. If we should fail in this respect, let us act as we should
   after any other fault, try to regain what we have lost by interior
   humility, but a humility that is sweet and tranquil, without
   self-contempt, or annoyance with ourselves or others. I repeat, without
   despondency or voluntary vexation, for the first involuntary movements
   do not depend upon ourselves, and provided that we do not give our
   consent to them, they will make us exercise more meritoriously the
   virtues of patience, meekness and humility. In this miserable exile we
   find everywhere continual and unavoidable dangers and there is no other
   way of safe-guarding oneself, than to take quietly, and without
   over-eagerness, those precautions that prudence suggests, and then to
   trust everything to divine Providence. Throw yourself into the arms of
   God and remain there peacefully and without care, like a little child
   in the arms of a good and loving mother. Whoever knows how to make use
   of this practice will find in it a treasure of peace and of merit. Try
   to act thus about everything and at all times, and to adopt somewhat of
   this interior spirit. Nothing could be more calculated to pacify and to
   moderate impulsiveness and natural impetuosity; nothing could better
   prevent or soften a thousand bitter annoyances, and a thousand uneasy
   forebodings. The state of P.F. is to be lamented. God wills to sanctify
   her indeed, since He afflicts her so grievously at the end of her life.
   At that time it is doubly hard to nature to be neglected, but what a
   consolation to be able to suffer so much for God before going to appear
   before Him. Consolations are in truth a great blessing, but not to be
   compared to sufferings and trials. God preserve me from that sort of
   blessing. I have no doubt I should like it and find comfort in it. A
   middling virtue could make good use of the first grace, but it would
   require heroic virtue to practise, with God's help, the second. I
   remain yours in our Lord until death and even after, if God will do me
   this favour. I sincerely hope that He will.

  Letter XVI.--Detachment.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. Bitterness mingled with pleasure

     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. I am not surprised, my dear Sister, at the trouble which the
   grievous trial to which our Lord has subjected you, has caused. This
   sort of event affects us all the more keenly in that they wound us in
   our most intimate affections. But if I am not surprised at this
   involuntary trouble, at the same time I urge you to supersede it in
   your heart by an entire resignation to the will of God. How great will
   be the treasures of grace, of merit, and of peace which such an act
   will bring to you! It is on this account that I have so constantly
   inculcated the virtue of perfect abandonment, and still preach it
   incessantly, wishing you to become as tranquil and as happy as I wish
   you to be holy. You have not yet attained to this, but with God's help
   you will.

   2nd. God allows my sick relation to remain in the same state, to prove,
   and to convert the whole family. If they avail themselves of this
   opportunity, as I have every reason to believe they will, I shall bless
   God from the bottom of my heart for this happy occurrence which is
   worth more than all the fortunes in the world.

   3rd. I am about to lose the best and dearest friend I had left, one
   whom I most esteemed, and on whom I could thoroughly rely. God has
   willed it thus. His holy will be done! Fiat! I commend him to your
   prayers.

   4th. Blessed be God in all, and for all, but especially in this, that
   He knows so well how to make everything serve for the sanctification of
   His elect by one another. On this subject the holy Archbishop of
   Cambray has well said that God makes use of one diamond to polish
   another. What a useful thought for our consolation! and one that will
   prevent us ever being scandalised at the little persecutions of one
   another that good people are given to.

   5th. Hail and rain have caused great havoc in many provinces as well as
   in your neighbourhood. May God grant us grace to derive profit from all
   these disasters for the expiation of our sins. A simple and sincere
   "fiat" is worth more than all the superfluities that we desire, because
   it adds to our treasure for eternity. Once filled with these high
   thoughts and hopes, we shall feel much less the occurrences of this
   short and miserable life.

   6th. By dint of constantly thinking of death, we shall gradually come
   to contemplate it without shrinking. Fr. Bourdaloue has very well
   expressed this when he said, "the thought of death is indeed a sad one,
   but by dint of considering it as salutary, it will at last appear
   almost pleasant"; and a Jesuit theologian, Fr. Francis Suarez, said
   when his last moment came, "I did not know it was so sweet to die."

   7th. Sometimes one hears it said, "I have no longer either help to
   fortify me, or instruction to encourage me." This is an occasion for
   sacrifice, "fiat, fiat." All instruction, however much it may
   strengthen us, does not equal in value what we gain by one simple
   "fiat" uttered in the lack of all extraneous help. The high road to all
   perfection is pointed out in the "Our Father." "Fiat voluntas tua." Say
   this with your lips as well as you can; and still more perfectly in
   your heart, and be assured that, with this interior disposition nothing
   is wanting to you, nor ever will be. Learn by this to find repose in no
   matter what difficulties and troubles, because all will come right when
   God pleases, and according to our desires, if He should will it so, or
   permit it. Crosses and afflictions are such great graces that the
   wicked are rarely converted without them, and good people are only made
   perfect by the same means.

   8th. God can easily make up for all, and really does so if we wish for
   nothing but Him, and expect to receive all from Him alone. It is in
   order to lead us gradually and by a happy necessity to this beautiful
   and desirable condition that He frequently deprives us of all human aid
   and consolation, and in the same way He mingles bitterness with worldly
   pleasures to disgust and detach the souls of worldly people from them,
   in order to save them. Fortunate disappointments! happy privations!
   which come from the goodness of God rather than from His justice. It is
   thus that we ought to regard them.

  Letter XVII.--Conduct during Trials.

   To the same Sister. On conduct during trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Ought you not to be able to overcome your fears, and to check your
   tears after all the experience you have had of the way in which your
   mind creates phantoms when anything affects it keenly, making you
   indulge in idle terrors? If it is impossible to prevent these tiresome
   wanderings of the imagination, at least endeavour to gain some profit
   by them, and to make of them matter for interior sacrifice, and an
   occasion for the exercise of a complete abandonment to all the decrees
   of divine Providence whatever they may be. I am of your opinion, and
   have never desired, and still less, prayed for pains and
   contradictions. Those sent by Providence are quite enough without
   wishing for more, or inflicting them on oneself. We must wait and
   prepare ourselves for these; that is the best way to gain strength and
   courage to receive them, and to bear them properly when God sends them.
   This is one of my favourite practices, and suits me both for this life
   and the next. I offer to God, beforehand, all the sacrifices that occur
   to my mind without any effort of my own. It is to enable us to acquire
   the merit of this offering that God tries us by these ideas, and these
   fears of future evil that He does not intend to send us. When, on the
   other hand, He sends us consolations whether spiritual or temporal, we
   ought to accept them simply, with gratitude and thanksgiving, but
   without clinging to them or taking too much pleasure in them, because
   all joy that is not in God only serves to feed our self-love. Your
   solitude in the absence of the person on whom you could most rely, in
   spite of her having been very tiresome, cannot fail to be very good for
   you. How many acts of resignation will you not have made in your
   illness and weakness! How often will you not have raised your heart to
   God! How many holy affections and good resolutions will you not have
   made! You will be saved by the good will which God sees in your heart.
   Each of us has a particular path to follow, according to his light. Try
   to make use of your present circumstances and of your sadness, to place
   your whole confidence in God, both for time and eternity. The present
   calamities of which you paint so sad a picture, will, if only for the
   sake of your own peace, place you under the necessity of making
   incessantly, very meritorious sacrifices to God. Public misfortunes are
   great, but the part you can take about them is great also. The lives of
   sinful men, and that we all are, ought to be passed entirely in works
   of penance and mortification, and God shows His mercy by giving us this
   remedy with His own hand. The chalice is bitter, it is true, but how
   infinitely more bitter would be the pains of hell, or of purgatory; and
   since we must drink this chalice whether we like it or not, let us, as
   the proverb says, make a virtue of necessity. In this way all our
   difficulties will be smoothed away. As you say, interior sufferings are
   much harder to bear, but they are also more meritorious and purifying,
   and after having been made to endure these purifications and
   detachments, everything else seems easy. Then it will be much more easy
   to give oneself up to a perfect abandonment and a filial confidence in
   God through Jesus Christ. The reflexions you make on this subject are
   reasonable and true, but too human. We should always revert to
   abandonment and hope in divine Providence, for what can man do, exposed
   as he is to continual vicissitudes? Let us depend then on God alone,
   for He never changes, and knows better than we do what is necessary for
   us, and, like a good father, is always ready to give it. But He has to
   do with children who are often so blind that they do not see for what
   they are asking. Even in their prayers, that to them seem so sensible
   and just, they deceive themselves by desiring to arrange the future
   which belongs to God alone. When He takes away from us what we consider
   necessary, He knows how to supply its place imperceptibly, in a
   thousand different ways unknown to us. This is so true that bitterness
   and heaviness of heart borne with patience and interior silence, make
   the soul advance more than would the presence and instruction of the
   holiest and cleverest director. I have had a hundred experiences of
   this, and am convinced that, at present, this is your path, and the
   only things that God asks of you are submission, abandonment,
   confidence, sacrifice, and silence. Practice these virtues as well as
   you can without too violent efforts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVIII.--Will of God to be Preferred.

   To the same Sister.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Believe me, my dear Sister, and put an end to all your fears and
   entrust all to divine Providence who makes use of hidden but infallible
   means of bringing everything to serve His ends. Whatever men may say or
   do, they can only act by God's will or permission, and everything they
   do He makes serve for the accomplishment of His merciful designs. He is
   able to attain His purposes by means apparently most contrary, as to
   refresh His servants in the midst of a fiery furnace, or to make them
   walk on the waters. We shall experience more sensibly this fatherly
   protection of Providence if we abandon ourselves to Him with filial
   confidence. Quite recently I have had experience of this, therefore I
   have prayed to God with greater fervour than ever to grant me the grace
   never to have my own will which is always blind, and often dangerous,
   but always that His which is just, holy, loving, and beneficent may be
   accomplished. Ah! if you only knew what a pleasure it is to find no
   peace or contentment except in accomplishing the will of God which is
   as good as it is powerful, you would not be able to desire anything
   else. Never look upon any pain, no matter of what kind, as a sign of
   being far from God; because crosses and sufferings are, on the
   contrary, effects of His goodness and love. "But," say you, "what will
   become of me if . . . ?" This is indeed a temptation of the enemy. Why
   should you be so ingenious in tormenting yourself beforehand about
   something which perhaps will never happen? Sufficient for the day is
   the evil thereof. Uneasy forebodings do us much harm; why do you so
   readily give way to them? We make our own troubles, and what do we gain
   by it? but lose, instead, so much both for time and eternity. When we
   are obsessed in spite of ourselves by these worrying revisions let us
   be faithful in making a continual sacrifice of them to the sovereign
   Master. I conjure you to do this, as in this way you will induce God to
   deal favourably with you and to help you in every way. You will acquire
   a treasure of virtue and merit for Heaven, and a submission and
   abandonment which will enable you to make more progress in the ways of
   God than any other practice of piety. It is, possibly, with this view
   that God permits all these troublesome and trying imaginations. Profit
   by them then, and God will bless you. By your submission to His good
   pleasure you will make greater progress than you could by hearing
   beautiful sermons, or reading pious books. If you only understood this
   great truth thoroughly, you would enjoy great peace of mind, and
   advance rapidly in the ways of God. Without this submission to His good
   pleasure no spirituality counts for much. As long as people restrict
   themselves to exterior practices, they can but have a very thin veneer
   of true and solid piety which consists essentially, and in reality, in
   willing in everything what God wills, and in the manner in which He
   wills it. When you have attained to this, the Spirit of God will reign
   absolutely in your heart, will supply for all else, and will never fail
   you in your need if you call with humble confidence for His help. This
   is of faith, but is known to very few souls who are otherwise pious.
   Thus, for the want of this disposition we see them kept back and
   obstructed in the ways of God. What a pitiful blindness! All the
   business and complicated affairs in which we are immersed by God's will
   and by the decrees of His divine Providence, are equal to the most
   delightful contemplation, if one says from the bottom of one's heart,
   "My God, this is Your will, and, therefore, also mine." Although this
   is said only in the higher part of the soul without the will seeming to
   take any share in it, still the sacrifice is no less agreeable to God,
   and meritorious for oneself. Keep with a firm determination to this
   practice and you will soon experience its excellent results. If you
   could also combine with it a certain peace and quietness of mind, a
   certain gentleness of manner towards others and also towards yourself,
   without ever showing signs of annoyance, worry, or vexation, what great
   and meritorious sacrifices you will have made! At least humble yourself
   gently after all your faults, and return to God with confidence as if
   nothing had happened, as the "Spiritual Combat" teaches. As we can
   never enjoy happiness or peace in this miserable world except in
   proportion as we blindly submit to the decrees of divine Providence, I
   shall continue to speak to you about it untiringly. Believe me and rely
   on divine Providence alone, and abandon everything to His care
   absolutely and without reserve. Do with simplicity what you believe you
   ought to do under the circumstances, so as not to tempt God, but do it
   gently, quietly, and without effort, trouble, excitement, or eagerness;
   as St. Francis of Sales advises. Of how many anxieties, disappointments
   and forebodings should we not rid ourselves, if we could only act in
   this reasonable and Christian manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIX.--The Happiness of Resignation.

   On the happiness of souls that abandon themselves to God in their
   afflictions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It does not astonish me, my dear Sister, that you find it difficult to
   understand the ways of divine Providence. Neither do I understand them
   any better than you, but what I know and what you know as well as I, is
   that God arranges and disposes of all things as He pleases, and makes
   use of whom He will to carry out His designs at the time and moment He
   has decided upon. Let us learn then to resign ourselves in all and
   everything with submission and confidence in Him Who can do all things,
   and Who disposes of all things according to His own plans. If we could
   only attain to this state of holy submission we should wait patiently
   for things to happen at the appointed time, instead of at the time
   that, in our impatience, we expect them. Abandonment to God's holy
   providence binds Him, in a way, to find a remedy for everything, and to
   provide for and console us in all our needs. Remind yourself of this
   great saying, "Everything passes away, God alone remains." Abandon
   yourself and all who are dear to you, therefore, to His loving care. In
   public disasters as in all others we should, by our confidence, glorify
   His infinite goodness, and then we shall be able to say with David, "We
   have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us; for the years
   in which we have seen evils." Suffering patiently endured, is the lot
   and the seal of the elect; let us say also with the same prophet, "I
   was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it." There
   is no greater consolation in our trials than a lively faith in the
   goodness of Him Who sends them, an expectation of that eternal
   happiness these trials have merited for us, the remembrance of our sins
   that they help to expiate, and the contemplation of the sufferings that
   Jesus Christ underwent for love of us. Impatience would only serve to
   aggravate the evil, while patience has the great power of lightening
   them. God has different chastisements for each country and these are
   like so many different rods with which He threatens us and punishes our
   sins, but always with a fatherly love, since He only threatens and
   punishes us in this world in order to be able to save us with greater
   certainty. May He be blessed for ever!

SIXTH BOOK

    ON THE CONTINUATION OF TRIALS, AND FEAR OF THE ANGER OF GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter I.--On Temptations.

   On temptations and the fear of giving way to them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I acknowledge, my dear Sister, that the trial to which our Lord is
   subjecting you at this moment, is worse than any through which you have
   hitherto passed. To a soul that loves God, the fear of offending Him is
   worse than any other. Nothing is more frightful than to have the mind
   filled with bad thoughts, and to feel the heart carried away to some
   extent, against one's will, by the violence of the temptation; but that
   which is, to you, a subject of cruel anguish is, to your directors, a
   subject for satisfaction. The stronger are your fears, and the greater
   the horror these temptations cause you, the more evident is it that
   your will has given no consent to them, and that, far from doing you
   harm they only serve to increase your merit. In this even more than in
   other things you ought blindly to follow the advice of those who direct
   you. Besides, and I say it without the least hesitation, all these
   fearful temptations, these interior revolts which agitate you, the
   discouragement which makes you despond, that kind of despair which
   seems to separate you from God irreparably; all this takes place in the
   inferior part of your soul without any express and formal consent of
   the superior part. The latter also, it is true, is often so troubled,
   and so blinded that it cannot discern what it has, or has not, done; or
   whether or not it has consented. It is this that makes this trial so
   painful; but take courage! it is then that you must cast yourself, as
   well as you can, at the feet of Jesus Christ crucified, humbling
   yourself and being overcome at the extent of your weakness, but quietly
   and without vexation, imploring the help of God through His divine Son
   our Saviour and our Advocate, through the intercession of Mary our
   sweet mother, and firmly believe that He Who pursues us when we flee
   from Him will never permit us to be separated from Him against our
   will.

  Letter II.--The Fear of Temptation.

   To Sister de Lesen, a Religious of the Annunciation. On the fear of
   temptations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   It is an illusion to have too great a fear of combats. Never shrink
   from the occasions afforded you by God of acquiring merit, and of
   practising virtue, under the pitiful pretext of avoiding the danger of
   committing sin by avoiding the struggle. Do soldiers who fight for
   their king act in this way! and do we not know that we are soldiers of
   Jesus Christ and that our whole life is nothing but a continual
   struggle, and that only he who has fought valiantly will win the crown.
   Blush for your cowardice, and when you find yourself contradicted or
   humiliated say that now is the time to prove to your God the sincerity
   of your love. Put your trust in His goodness and the power of His
   grace, and this confidence will ensure you the victory. And even should
   it happen that you should occasionally commit some fault, the harm it
   will do you will be very easily repaired. This harm, besides, is almost
   nothing compared to the great good that will accrue to your soul either
   by your effort to resist, or the merit resulting from victory, or even
   by the humiliation these slight defects occasion you. And if your
   temptations are altogether interior; if you fear to be carried away by
   your thoughts and ideas, get rid of that fear also. Do not resist these
   interior temptations directly; let them fall, and resist them
   indirectly by recollection and the thought of God; and if you are not
   able to get rid of them in this way, endure them patiently. The
   distrust that makes you try to avoid temptations that are sent to you
   by God, will cause others more dangerous of which you have no
   suspicion, for, what temptation could be more evident and plain than
   the thought which you express when you say that you will never succeed
   in the spiritual life. What! are not all Religious called to this life
   and you in particular? Even this weakness so clearly revealed to you by
   your trial, and your inability to make any serious progress in
   perfection, or of enjoying any peace except in this way of life, is not
   this a magnificent sign that God calls you to it more especially than
   others? Open your eyes then and recognise the fact that all these
   thoughts that discourage, trouble, and weaken you, can only emanate
   from the devil. He wishes to deprive you of that spiritual strength of
   which you have need in order to overcome the repugnance that nature
   feels. I implore you not to fall into this trap, and not to continue to
   look upon the revolt of the passions as a sign of being at a distance
   from God. No, my dear daughter, it is, on the contrary, a greater grace
   then you can imagine. Becoming persuaded of your own feebleness and
   perversity, you will expect nothing from anyone but God and will learn
   to depend upon Him entirely. God alone ought to suffice to the soul who
   knows Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter III.--The State of One Tempted.

   An explanation of the state of a soul in temptation and of the designs
   of God in regard to it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   One would imagine, my good Sister, that you had never meditated on
   those numerous texts of holy Scripture in which the Holy Spirit makes
   us understand the necessity of temptation, and the good fruit derived
   from it by souls who do not allow themselves to become disheartened. Do
   you not know that it has been compared to a furnace in which clay
   acquires hardness, and gold is made brilliant; that it has been put
   before us as a subject of rejoicing, and a sign of the friendship of
   God; an indispensable lesson for the acquirement of the science of the
   saints? If you were to recall to mind these consoling truths you would
   not be able to give way to sadness. I declare to you in the name of our
   Saviour that you have no reason to fear. If you liked you could unite
   yourself to God as much or more than at the times of your greatest
   fervour. For this you have but one thing to do in your painful state,
   and this is to suffer in peace, in silence, with an unshaken patience,
   and an entire resignation, just as you would endure a fever or any
   other bodily ailment. Say to yourself now and then what you would say
   to a sick person to induce him to bear his pain with patience. You
   would represent to him that by giving way to impatience, or by
   murmuring he would only aggravate the evil and make it last the longer.
   Well! this is what you ought to say to yourself. I greatly approve of
   the order you have received to go to Holy Communion without taking any
   notice of your temptations. Your confessor is right, and would have
   made a great mistake if he had listened to what you said on the
   subject. "But," you will say, "if I have consented to the temptation,
   and have committed a mortal sin, what a misfortune!" It is not for you
   to judge about it, but to obey blindly; and this opinion is founded on
   the great principle that even should the confessor be mistaken, the
   penitent cannot be misled in obeying in good faith in the sight of God,
   those who are in the position of guides. "But," you say again, "I
   should like to know how my confessor can understand better than I what
   takes place in my soul during temptation?" Useless curiosity! It is not
   a question of knowing how this or that but it is so, and you must obey
   without reasoning or replying. Nevertheless, as I wish to be kind and
   gentle towards souls but little accustomed to the spiritual warfare, I
   will reply to your unexpressed question, and this reply will teach you
   some important things. You must know first that in each of us there
   are, as it were, two souls, or two persons; one, animal, sensitive, and
   earthly which is called the inferior part, the other spiritual, in
   which the free will resides, and this is called the superior part.
   Secondly, that all that takes place in the inferior and animal part,
   such as imaginations, feelings, disorderly movements, are in us, but
   not of us, and by their own nature are indeliberate and involuntary.
   All these can tempt us, but cannot compel the will to give free and
   voluntary consent without which there can be no sin. When the
   temptation is not strong it is easy to recognise for oneself and to
   feel that, far from giving consent to it, one rejects it; but when God
   permits the temptation to become strong and violent then, on account of
   the great involuntary agitation taking place in the inferior part, the
   superior has great difficulty in discerning its own movements, and
   remains in great perplexity and fear of having consented. Nothing more
   is wanting to occasion in these good souls the most terrible trouble
   and remorse which is a further trial permitted by God to prove their
   fidelity. Confessors who judge calmly and without difficulty, easily
   discern the truth; and the great distress the poor soul experiences,
   and its excessive fear of having consented, are to the confessor proof
   positive that there has been no full and deliberate consent. In fact we
   know by experience, that those who consent and give way to temptation
   do not suffer from these troubles and fears. The greater the temptation
   and the pain and fear that result, the more certain is the verdict in
   favour of the person tempted. I join therefore in the opinion of your
   confessor, and this is the rule I lay down.

   1st. Neither examine, nor accuse yourself as a rule about these things.

   2nd. Bear peacefully your humiliation and interior martyrdom which, I
   assure you, is a great grace from God, but a grace which you will not
   be able to understand properly till after the trial is over.

   3rd. This is the interior petition which you ought to make incessantly
   to God. "Lord, deign to preserve me from all sin, especially in this
   matter; but, as for the pain which mortifies, and ought to cure my
   self-love, and the humiliation and holy abjection which gall my pride
   and ought to destroy it, I accept them for as long as You please, and I
   thank You for them as for a grace. Grant, Lord, that these bitter
   remedies may take effect and that they may cure my self-love and
   vanity, and help me to acquire holy humility and a low opinion of
   myself which will form a solid foundation for the spiritual life, and
   for all perfection." I find you very ignorant on the subject of
   temptation. It is true that it does not come from God, Who does not
   tempt anyone, as St. James says. It comes, therefore, either from the
   devil, or our own temperament and imagination; but since God permits it
   for our good, we ought to adore His holy permission in all things
   except sin which He detests, and which we also ought to detest for love
   of Him. Be careful, then, not to allow yourself to get troubled and
   harassed by these temptations, for this trouble is much more to be
   feared than the temptations themselves.

   You tell me that you are travelling along the path that is very dark.
   That is exactly what is meant by "the way of pure faith." It is always
   obscure, and necessitates a complete abandonment to God. What could be
   more natural or more easy than to abandon yourself to so good and
   merciful a Father Who desires our welfare more than we do ourselves?
   "But," you add, "I am always in trouble and extremely afraid of having
   sinned; this makes life very miserable, and prevents me possessing the
   peace of the children of God." It is so for the present, I know, but I
   also know that by these continual terrors the salutary fear of God
   takes root in the soul, and is followed by love of Him. It is thus that
   God endeavours to make us disgusted with this life and with its false
   goods in order to attach us to Himself alone. Know that none can enjoy
   the peace of the children of God who have not shared their trials.
   Peace is only purchased by war, and is only enjoyed after victory. If
   you could only see as I do the advantages and good to be derived from
   the state in which God has permitted you to be; instead of repining as
   you do about it you would be making continual acts of thanksgiving. You
   are, you say, as deeply involved as the greatest sinners. Oh! my dear
   daughter, this is just what galls your pride. And what are we in truth
   but great sinners? Do we not carry about with us an amount of misery
   and corruption, which, without God's grace, would lead us into the
   gravest disorders? This is what God wishes to make us understand by
   personal experience without which we might live and die without ever
   attaining to a knowledge of our nothingness, the foundation of
   humility. Let us thank God for having solidly laid this foundation,
   necessary for the salvation of our souls, and also for the perfection
   of our state.

   The thought and fear of the justice of the judgments of God is a great
   grace, but do not spoil it by carrying this fear so far as to be
   troubled and rendered uneasy by it; because the true and right fear of
   God is always peaceful, quiet, and accompanied with confidence. When
   contrary effects are produced, reject them as coming from the devil who
   is the author of trouble and despair. "If I had made myself," you say,
   "I would have done it in such a way that---" Oh! what are you saying
   here? One must never wish to be other than what God wills. Do you not
   know that to be able to bear one's miseries, weaknesses, caprices,
   spiritual defects, follies, and extravagancies of the imagination, is
   the effect of heroic virtue? What treasures have not these same
   miseries enabled a crowd of saints of both sexes to acquire! In using
   them as subjects and matter for interior combats they have served for
   victories and for the final triumph of grace. You say again, "Of what
   use can it be to me for my heart to be emptied of one object if it
   becomes filled by another, and God has no place in it?" Know, daughter,
   that the heart is so full that it cannot be emptied all at once. It is
   a work of time, and as the space is enlarged God fills it gradually;
   but we shall not experience what St. Paul calls the plenitude of God
   until we are completely empty of all else. This will take a long time,
   and will require many trials to accomplish the work. Be patient and
   faithful. Have confidence and you will see the gift of God, and will
   experience His mercy.

  Letter IV.--Different Temptations.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On different temptations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I see clearly by your letter, my dear Sister, that in the midst of your
   interior troubles and trials, you have made unknowingly very solid
   progress.

   1st. To understand the value of the interior life, and of peace of
   mind, and to endeavour to acquire them through all your perplexities
   and drawbacks, is a good step in advance, the rest will follow in time
   and will be the result of your gentleness towards yourself and others.
   Let us accustom ourselves to accept everything in a right spirit from
   the hand of divine Providence, and to bless Him in all things, and for
   all things, whatever they may be. If we do this we shall find that what
   causes us most grief will, in the end, be most advantageous to us. Let
   us trust God and never be wanting in confidence; if necessary let us
   make more sacrifices, and thus we shall obtain continually fresh graces
   from Him, and shall increase our riches in Heaven.

   2nd. Thoughts and feelings against our neighbour, if not consented to
   interiorly, nor shown outwardly, are matter for merit, and are not
   sinful. Guard carefully the virtue of charity and gradually all this
   will subside and come to an end. If some interior or exterior fault
   should escape you, be content to humble yourself before God without
   trouble, but peacefully, and generously repair whatever pain you may
   have caused, or bad example you may have given. You will gain more by
   this apology than you have lost by the fault.

   3rd. Hardness and want of feeling in the reception of the Sacraments is
   certainly very painful; bear it with patience and humility; do what is
   in pour power gently in the spirit of pure faith; it is the greatest
   penance that God allots to any soul to purify it from self-seeking and
   the satisfactions of self-love.

   4th. Try during the day to make of everything a help for raising the
   heart to God, but without effort or eagerness. Observe the most filial
   submission to the different arrangements of divine Providence about
   everything; you will gain more by doing so than by all the spiritual
   exercises that you perform to please yourself. Above all make your
   perfection consist in willing exactly what pleases God, and in the way
   it pleases Him. His good pleasure is, in fact, the rule of all good
   will, and the principle of all perfection whether in Heaven or on
   earth.

  Letter V.--The Fear of Being Wanting in Submission.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureus (1734). On the
   fear of being wanting in submission to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   God grant me sufficient grace, I do not say, to cure you, but to help
   you to make your trouble salutary; and may He give me the necessary
   light to properly understand it. This trouble is not a fresh one, and I
   do not perceive any particular change in the state of your soul. Also I
   have no new remedy to give you. All that I can do is to repeat in a
   different way what I have said to you before. I have reduced my advice
   to rules and practices, and I beg of you in the name of Jesus Christ to
   read this letter, from time to time, in the presence of God and in a
   spirit of recollection. The most suitable time for reading it will be
   when you are a prey to darkness and mental agitation; for, during the
   time when the storm rages, no other reading can be of any use. An angel
   from Heaven himself could not succeed in giving you either light or
   consolation. There is no intelligence nor power in the world capable of
   wresting from the hand of God a soul He has seized in the rigour of His
   mercy to purify it by suffering.

   First rule. Be convinced that all the trials that God sends us in this
   life are sent in mercy more than in justice; this is why the prophet
   says that God remembers His mercy even when He is angry with us.

   Second rule. Even as God, for the conversion and sanctification of
   people in the world often sends them purely temporal afflictions such
   as illness, loss of goods, reverses of fortune, etc., so, likewise, for
   the purification and sanctification of the souls that belong to Him
   more entirely, especially in the Religious life, He sends spiritual
   trials and purely interior afflictions. It is thus that He acts with
   regard to you, for, although you are suffering from a bodily illness,
   your principal sufferings arise from the tortures of your mind which
   react on your body, and redouble and augment your illness, rendering it
   more painful.

   Third rule. As we help people in the world to sanctify themselves in
   temporal adversities by preaching patience, submission, and continual
   resignation, so also to souls in pain and interiorly crucified we
   preach nothing else but abandonment into the hands of God.

   Fourth rule. It is a certain and known fact that when one no longer
   commits either mortal or deliberate venial sin one makes more progress
   in the ways of God by suffering than by action; from which I conclude
   that all you need do to ensure your salvation, and even to attain
   perfection is to endure as patiently as you can, and with peace and
   interior resignation, the painful state in which you are, imploring the
   aid of divine grace with an unshaken confidence in the merits of Jesus
   Christ. This is your principal difficulty, you say. I admit it, but I
   have no doubt that this practice will become easy enough in time if you
   try to accustom yourself to it, and follow the rules I will give you.

   1st. To take, as you already do, the word "fiat" for your favourite
   act, and constant exercise.

   2nd. To despise and treat as nothing the continual rebellions you feel
   in your heart during your troubles, and not to attempt to resist them
   directly but to content yourself with pronouncing the word "fiat"; or,
   better still, simply to form an interior act. "But," you will say to
   me, "how can I despise or count as nothing these rebellions of the
   heart which prove to me that my submission to the will of God is
   neither interior nor real?" Listen to me, I beg of you, to the end. I
   feel that God inspires me for your good, and possibly for your
   consolation. You deceive yourself, Sister, and it is, no doubt, the
   most cruel of your trials to think that because of these violent, and
   to all appearances, voluntary rebellions of the heart, your submission
   is not real. In this respect you are by the divine permission rather
   like persons in the world with violent temptations to impurity, hatred,
   aversion, vengeance, or any other unruly impulse, that makes a strong
   impression but is indeliberate and involuntary. In these poor souls
   temptation is sometimes so violent, the accursed pleasure which is
   called precedent and involuntary seizes them so strongly, the tempter
   raises such a disturbance and causes so much trouble in the sensitive
   and inferior part, that it becomes impossible for them to discern if
   they have consented or not in the superior part. Only the confessor can
   know and discern by certain signs that they have not consented. In the
   same way God, for your greater trial does not allow you to distinguish
   that true submission which resides almost unknown to yourself, in the
   higher part of the soul as in a hiding place. But, thank God, I
   recognise, see, and feel that you have this true submission which is
   purely intellectual, spiritual, and well-nigh imperceptible. "But," you
   say, "how can you recognise, see, and feel in the depths of my soul
   what I cannot perceive in the slightest degree myself?" I will tell
   you, but possibly God may not allow you to understand it, or else only
   for a single moment so that the knowledge of it may not diminish in any
   way the pain by which He wishes to purify you by crucifying you.

   Let us return to the comparison of the other temptations. A person will
   tell me of the great interior trouble that these temptations to hatred,
   impurity, etc., cause her, and will add that the fear of having given
   way to them makes her feel troubled, saddened, and downcast. Here, I
   say to myself, is proof positive of a great fear of God, of a great
   horror of sin, and of a great wish to resist. Besides, theology as well
   as a knowledge of the human heart teaches me that a soul in this
   interior condition could not give a free, whole, entire and what is
   called deliberate consent; that if it did, it would immediately lose
   that interior state and habitual condition in which it is, and which I
   recognise in it. At the same time it might happen that on account of
   the violence and frequency of the temptations there may have been some
   negligence, some momentary surprise. For example: some slight desire
   for revenge begins, some feeling of pleasure half voluntary, as
   theology teaches, but, in this condition of the soul, full, entire and
   deliberate consent is not possible. Also we find by experience that
   those who really consent to sin are very far from feeling these pains
   and troubles, this despondency and fear; they feel no uneasiness
   whatever. You have only to apply this reasoning to your own state and
   you will see, as I do, when your soul has regained its calm, that the
   more you fear and are in trouble about your want of interior submission
   the more certain it is that you possess it in the depths of your soul.
   But God does not allow you to see it as I do, because the assurance of
   this submission, by consoling you and delivering you from your greatest
   trouble, would put an end to the state of trial in which God wishes you
   to remain for a certain time, the better to purify your soul in the
   crucible of affliction. From this I deduce a third rule; you must say
   the same "fiat" about the apparent absence of this submission that you
   so much desire, as you do about your other trials, because it is
   probably the most useful of all. You have perhaps some reason to fear
   lest this keen desire may be a seeking of self-love, which would find
   consolation for feeling convinced of having endured them well. Do not
   be surprised then that God, wishing to purify your soul from all the
   ingenuities of self-love, refuses you this consolation; and doubt not
   that by so doing He confers upon you a great grace. Therefore when you
   feel the greatest sadness on account of your supposed want of
   submission or the greatest terror at the idea of the judgments of God,
   the only thing to do is to say "Lord, You do not even wish me to know
   in what state I am, whether I have the submission I ought to have or am
   deprived of it. As You will, fiat, I submit to this also." You can
   then, with the intention of regaining interior peace, and to encourage
   yourself, say, "At least I feel that by the grace of my God I desire
   this submission with a desire that is, perhaps, only too great and too
   strong since the fear of not possessing it throws me into a state of
   agitation and despondency, and distresses me more than anything else.
   Therefore, as I have a sincere desire for it, I must have all the
   effect and the fruit of it, because a sincere desire is of equal value
   to the thing desired and makes the merit or demerit of our good works."

   When nature and the inferior part are thus distressed and despair of
   any remedy, or of any consolation for its interior miseries, then it is
   that self-love is in its agony and on the point of expiring. Ah! let it
   die, then, this wretched love of self, let it be crucified! this
   domestic enemy of our poor souls, this enemy of God and of all good! I
   add some advice which will form the fourth rule. Practise a blind
   submission to those who guide you, and beware in future of omitting a
   single communion you have been ordered to make. "But," say you, "what
   about this frightful indifference towards God?" This, Sister, is only
   superficial and in the inferior part. The superior part desires God,
   and He is satisfied, but does not wish you to know it. An evident sign
   that I am right is that you acknowledge to being upset and saddened
   during all your exercises to feel that you do not love God, and that
   you can only pity yourself and tell Him, "My God, I do not love You!"
   Oh! how violent must be that profoundly interior desire if you are so
   deeply afflicted at the mere idea of not loving Him! This is a sure
   sign that in the midst of your apparent coldness, insensibility and
   indifference God has enkindled in your soul the fire of a great love
   which will go on increasing and becoming stronger and more fervent even
   by the fears themselves of not loving Him. "But," you say, "why does He
   remain so hidden that I can neither feel His presence, nor know that He
   is there." This, Sister, is the simple effect of God's goodness to
   purify you and to make you merit a more perfect love. If you understand
   it at present you would be so satisfied with your love of God as to
   think more of this love than of God Himself Who ought to be its
   sovereign and sole object. It would happen to you to the injury of this
   love what Fénélon said about the sensible presence of God, that often
   by its sweetness it makes us forget God Himself; that is to say that we
   attach ourselves to the sweetness and enjoyment more than to God until
   we actually forget the object of it, which is, God realised by faith.
   You cry out and exclaim, "What, must I then abstain from asking for
   this love?" Your heart asks for it without your knowledge; your fears,
   troubles and alarms about it are petitions and prayers most powerful
   with God Who beholds to what these fears and your most secret desires
   tend, and even sees the most hidden recesses of your heart. Remain,
   therefore, in peace and fear nothing. If you are in need of a director
   God Himself will direct you, or will find you a suitable person.
   Sacrifice, abandonment, peace and confidence in all things! In the
   meanwhile leave everything to God. He will care for and provide for
   all. Amen! Amen!

  Letter VI.--Fear Caused by Self-Love.

   To Sister Marie-Henriette de Mahuet (1731). How the fear of displeasing
   God may be caused by self-love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   On re-reading your letter to which I have not been able to reply
   sooner, I remarked two things in it: many graces of God, and many very
   evident marks of self-love. Your pain and distress are, you say, made
   worse by your uneasiness. Pain and distress are graces from God which
   serve to purify and to elevate the soul; uneasiness is an effect of
   self-love which is agitated and complaining under this interior cross
   by which God desires to put an end to it in order that you may live a
   new life in Him. You experience a miserable inability to make your mind
   act, so that all reasoning and reflexion are a weariness to you.
   Another sign that God would have you feel that He wishes to do away
   with your own petty and miserable operations and to substitute the
   divine operation without which your progress would be very slow and
   painful. But, at the same time you are very much afraid of wasting
   time. Another effect of self-love always seeking for certainty on which
   to place reliance, while God wills you to rely entirely upon Him. Books
   and directors say enough to reassure you completely as concerns those
   foolish fears of wasting time, suggested by self-love or the devil, in
   the position you hold. You always feel confused and in a state of
   abstraction that makes you seem stupid, and on account of this you
   believe yourself to be under an illusion. God grant that it may not be
   a mistake to believe that you are in that state of abstraction which is
   one of the greatest graces that God could bestow on a soul. If you are
   actually, as you say, in this state I congratulate you; far from being
   an illusion, what you call abstraction can be nothing else but a
   profound recollection leading to everything good by the constant
   feeling of the presence of God, and by an intimate union already
   formed, or about to be formed in your soul. You are in great peace:
   another grace; but you do not dare to think so: another effect of
   self-love. Do you not know that the solid peace established by God in a
   soul subject to trials, is always without sensible sweetness? and
   besides, does not God necessarily deprive a soul of sensible sweetness
   when it would only make use of it to nourish its self-love? Could He do
   us a greater favour than to kill this domestic enemy by depriving it of
   its most essential sustenance, such as sensible spiritual sweetness. It
   would indeed be very unjust to complain of this God of infinite mercy,
   Who alone knows how to purify your soul, a thing you would never have
   been able to do yourself. Your very complaints prove that you would
   never have had the courage to put an end to your self-love which alone
   impedes the reign of divine love in your heart. Bless our Lord then for
   sparing you the trouble and because He only asks you to allow Him a
   free hand to accomplish this work in you. You fear, you say, that your
   past unfaithfulness may prevent the operations of God in your soul. No,
   my dear Sister, neither your past infidelities, nor yet your present
   miseries, darkness, and weakness ought to terrify you. The only
   obstacles to the divine operations are your want of submission and your
   voluntary annoyance in times of spiritual poverty, obscurity and
   weakness. Poverty, darkness and weakness patiently endured without
   anxiety would, on the contrary, only facilitate the divine action. You
   have nothing to fear but your own fears. However, if you wish to know
   how you ought to act during these interior trials I will tell you. You
   ought to keep an attitude of peaceful silent waiting, submissive, and
   entirely abandoned to the divine will, as one would wait under shelter
   until the storm had passed, leaving to God the task of calming the
   elements let loose. The difference between outward and inward storms is
   that patience in the former case could not prevent the greatest
   disasters resulting, while in the latter case it would produce the
   greatest good in the soul.

   Your excessive fears about your past confessions are another result of
   self-love which desires certainty about everything. God, on the
   contrary, wills that we should be deprived of the absolute certitude so
   pleasing to our self-love. We must then make a sacrifice of it to our
   sovereign Master Who has willed it so to keep us in humiliation and
   complete dependence. When you do violence to yourself you imagine that
   it does not please God on account of the imperfection of your interior
   dispositions. Another very dangerous illusion of the devil by which he
   hopes either to prevent you from doing good, or else to throw you into
   a state of uneasiness and trouble after having done so. In the one
   case, as in the other, he would deprive you of a great deal of your
   merit. Do not, I beg of you, be trapped in such a palpable snare.

   What causes me pleasure is, that in spite of mistakes caused by your
   inexperience I find in your soul, by the grace of God, the two
   dispositions most essential to the divine operations, namely, a firm
   resolution to belong to God without reserve whatever it may cost you,
   and a firm and constant will to avoid the smallest deliberate fault.
   Persevere in these dispositions, keep more on your guard than you have
   done hitherto against the secret seekings of self-love, and you will
   find that the reign of God will be re-established within you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VII.--The Want of Good-Will.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil (1738). On the fear of being
   deficient in good-will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yes, my dear Sister, in spite of the fears which haunt you and cause
   you ceaseless agitation you should apply yourself with all the energy
   of which you are capable to the practice of an entire and filial
   abandonment into the hands of God.

   1st. Your greatest mistake as well as your deepest affliction is the
   conviction that you are wanting in that good-will which is the
   essential condition of the friendship of God. Yes, doubtless you are
   wanting in a good-will that you can feel and know that you possess; but
   there is a certain settled will that God preserves in the centre of
   your soul, and which I clearly perceive in you in spite of your
   contrary opinion. Therefore let my decision tranquillize you. Return
   thanks to God that in depriving you of those gifts which are sensible,
   and which would only serve as food for self-love, He preserves in you,
   by a singular effect of His grace the far more precious gifts of the
   Spirit. Your abandonment in the midst of the apparent absence of
   good-will should serve in a powerful way to purify and to augment this
   imperceptible good-will which is in your soul. This is quite certain.
   Keep firmly to this belief and in the end you will be convinced of its
   truth by your own experience.

   2nd. What I have just said about the absence of good-will I say also
   about the lack of power which forms the other subject of your fears.
   What is this want of power about? It prevents you from making
   recognized acts in turning towards God. These acts would give you
   pleasure; but, from the moment that God does not require them you would
   do wrong to force yourself to make them. This is an infidelity for
   which you pay dearly by a great increase of lassitude and desolation.
   What then is to be done? What you can do, and for which you will never
   lack power. This is to form a simple desire of good, for God sees all
   the actions you would wish to perform in this sincere disposition to
   act rightly. Cease then to distress yourself and to lament over your
   weakness. Rather say "Fiat, fiat." This will be of infinitely more
   value than anything that you could say or do according to your own
   ideas, or to please yourself. I allow you, however, on account of your
   weakness, to say to yourself from time to time, "I know that usually I
   must wish to turn to God, but I am not able to do so. I know also that
   God sees this desire, and that this desire is all that He requires of
   me even though it be at once arrested, and as it were, stifled. I ought
   then to remain in peace and to depend on His love." "But," I hear you
   say to me, "sometimes it seems as if I had lost this desire," and my
   answer to this is, "why do you experience so much anxiety about this
   supposed deficiency?" The privation of an object causes pain only in
   proportion to the affection you entertain for it; if you had no desire
   for it you would experience no pain at being deprived of it. Are you in
   great distress about the want of riches, honours, beauty, etc.? No,
   because these things do not affect you, and you simply do not think
   about them. It would be the same about the desire for God if the desire
   itself were, in truth, absent from your mind. If then this apparent
   absence afflicts you it shows plainly that it is not a real absence.
   You are only suffering from this dearth of strength and grace because
   at present God requires no more from you; but you do not experience any
   want of good desires, since you feel so much sorrow at being unable to
   form them. Remain therefore in peace in your great spiritual poverty.
   It is a real treasure if you know how to accept it for the love of God.
   I see plainly that you have never understood in what true poverty and
   the nudity of the spirit consists, by which God succeeds in detaching
   us from ourselves and from our own operations to purify us more
   completely, and to simplify us. This complete deprivation which reduces
   us to acts of bare faith and of pure love alone, is the final
   disposition necessary for perfect union. It is a true death to self; a
   death very inward, very crucifying, very difficult to bear, but it is
   soon rewarded by a resurrection, after which one lives only for God and
   of God through and with Jesus Christ. Understand then your blindness in
   grieving for what is the surest guarantee of your spiritual progress.
   After the soul has mounted the first steps in the ladder of perfection,
   it can scarcely make any progress except by the way of privation and
   nudity of spirit, of annihilation and death of all created things, even
   of those that are spiritual. Only on this condition can it be perfectly
   united to God Who can neither be felt, known or seen. Oh! daughter of
   little faith, of little intelligence, and of little courage, who
   afflict yourself and are in despair about what ought to console and
   rejoice you! Despise your self-love, tell it that it may despair as
   much as if it found itself struck to the heart, but that your soul will
   rejoice in God over its despair, even should it be torn with vexation.

   3rd. As to the violent desire you sometimes feel to belong entirely to
   God, and as to what you feel directly after, as though you were being
   repulsed by an invisible hand, assuredly you have no reason to conclude
   from this that you are cast away. These spiritual vicissitudes ought to
   inspire you with an absolutely contrary conviction because this
   two-fold feeling is an infallible sign of the action of the Holy Spirit
   who works in us by this inward crucifixion the death of self. But what
   am I saying! if God allowed you to understand it as I do this would
   cease to be a trial, but would be changed into an ineffable joy. Happy
   daughter that you are without knowing it, cease to increase your
   distress by reflexions quite contrary to the truth of God.

   4th. But what can be done you ask when you can no longer make an act of
   abandonment? Abandon then even this abandonment by a simple "fiat"
   which then becomes the most perfect abandonment. Oh! grand idea! how it
   will charm the heart of God, and what an act of the most perfect love
   it contains! Earthly lovers sometimes come to this through the excess
   of their insane love. It is your state of privation and sacrifice which
   has gradually led you to this holy excess of despairing love, and is
   precisely what God intends to effect by these privations, sufferings
   and interior weaknesses.

   5th. God almost always allows a soul to imagine that this sort of
   affliction will never end. Why? In order to give occasion for a more
   complete abandonment without end, without limit, without measure; it is
   in this that pure and perfect love consists.

   6th. Once more; you are only powerless to do those things that God does
   not wish you to do and that it would not be expedient for you to do if
   you were able. God effects then within you something so excellent that
   if you could understand it you would fall prostrate in thanksgiving.
   Fortunate weakness which prevents you interfering by your wretched and
   petty operations with those which the Holy Spirit effects in you almost
   invisibly, but which I can plainly perceive, and for which I return
   thanks to God for you, poor blind creature that you are.

   7th. It is quite unnecessary to explain your troubles and doubts; they
   are not sins, but simply spiritual crosses, which it is only necessary
   to bear with unlimited submission. It is on this account that God has
   made it impossible for you to speak about them, or even to have
   distinct ideas about them because nothing sanctifies pain so much as
   silence both exterior and interior. What a great sacrifice the "fiat"
   becomes then, especially if it is hidden in a simple desire that can
   scarcely be discerned! God, however, sees all the greatness and extent
   of this sacrifice. This desire tells Him all that we wish Him to know
   without allowing us to enjoy the least consolation, nor giving us any
   certainty. From this there results a terrible agony which drives
   self-love to despair and assures in us at the same time the triumph of
   divine charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VIII.--The Love of Creatures and of God.

   To the same Sister. On the fear of loving creatures more than God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am delighted, my dear Sister, that God has made use of my letter to
   reassure you and to make you understand the reason of the difference
   between the love that we have for God and that which we feel for
   creatures, about which you have been so terrified. It is true that if
   we were more holy our love for God would be more ardent, and more
   tender. The want of this sensible tenderness is well calculated to
   humiliate us but ought not to trouble us. It is another misery in
   addition to so many others which will become for us a source of grace
   and merit when we understand how to endure it in peace without any
   vexed feelings of self-love and pride. For, to regard all these
   miseries in peace and humility, trying all the time to diminish them
   with the help of God's grace by perpetual vigilance and tranquil prayer
   is, so to say, no longer to have them, in the sight of God. Allow
   yourself to become thoroughly imbued with this truth, as certain as it
   is but little known. But I add, this coldness we feel towards God ought
   not to trouble us, because it by no means proves that we are deficient
   in real love. Recall the words of our Lord to St. Catherine of Siena:
   "My daughter, I leave to you and all creatures the love which is tender
   and sensible, and reserve for myself the love of preference which is
   purely spiritual." This love resides in the apex of the soul; that
   impregnable citadel, the key of which is held by free will which
   governs the whole. As long as charity has not been driven from this
   citadel, even if the greatest indifference invades the feelings,
   nothing is yet lost; and should this sensible coldness be only a
   painful trial and not an effect of your own negligence, it will help to
   increase the merit of this genuine love. As an instance a Christian
   mother would weep and be inconsolable at the death of her beloved
   children; but how great soever her sorrow she would not have them
   return to life at the price of one single venial sin; do you not see
   that for this mother the horror of sin is the more heroic in being in
   opposition to a love that is more sensibly felt? It is the same with
   contrition, and all acts of the love of God. These acts are produced in
   the higher faculties of the soul, and are spiritually accomplished as
   if without our knowledge, and it is a great advantage to us that it
   should be so. During this life we are such miserable creatures that
   every gift that we recognize is changed into poison by our self-love.
   This is what in a measure compels God to hide the graces He bestows
   upon us. If we understood our own interests properly we should look
   upon this salutary blindness as the most precious of all graces, and
   like holy job we should never kiss His hand more lovingly than when it
   seems to weigh most heavily upon us.

  Letter IX.--The Love of Creatures and of God.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet. On the fear of displeasing God,
   and deceiving others.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Madame and very dear Sister,

   I can only bless God for prolonging your trial, and for renewing those
   interior sufferings that you experienced in prayer because I find you
   are acquiring so much profit therefrom and practising so well the
   virtues I recommended to you, namely, the complete sacrifice of
   everything, and a total abandonment to the good pleasure of God.

   Far from wishing to see you lose these occasions of amassing invaluable
   merit, I can only congratulate you and exhort you to persevere. Prayer
   made under such circumstances is indeed very painful, but at the same
   time it is the most fruitful and meritorious. If this great fear of
   displeasing God were anything else but a trial I could very easily
   dispel it. It will suffice to ask you from whence comes this fear, as
   your conscience is free from any serious matter, and as you feel and
   even know that usually to please God you would not hesitate to
   undertake things that are hardest to nature. You clearly perceive that
   your terrors are nothing but idle imaginations. Therefore if God does
   not wish you to be entirely delivered from them, you have nothing to do
   but to drop them like a stone in the water. Take no more notice of them
   than flies that pass backwards and forwards buzzing in your ears.
   Despise them and have patience. It is very surprising that after all I
   have said to you, and all that you have read you still recur to the
   interior changes and vicissitudes that you experience. It is just as if
   you imagined yourself obliged to note down all the variations of the
   atmosphere, and to make known to me that after a few fine days the
   weather had become stormy and that a hard winter had followed a very
   beautiful autumn. It is the rule established by God, and these are
   merely the vicissitudes of a life in which nothing is stable; it is
   what all the saints have experienced. In fine weather you must prepare
   for bad times, and when they come as they infallibly will, you must
   bear them patiently and let the storms blow over and wait for the
   return of better weather. Instead of all the violent and forced acts
   you compel yourself to make it would be much better, as I have already
   told you, to keep yourself in the presence of God in an interior
   silence of respect, humility, submission, and abandonment. But
   self-love is always anxious to feel and to enjoy; this cannot be,
   however, God does not wish it, so you must give in with a good grace.
   It occurs to your mind, I am aware, that you are deceiving everybody,
   but you know perfectly well yourself that you do not intend to deceive,
   and that ought to be enough for you. If it came into your head to kill
   yourself or to throw yourself from a height you would say at once,
   "What folly! I know well that I shall not do it." Put a stop then in
   the same way to the follies and absurdities of the human mind and
   particularly of the imagination. These thoughts are like tiresome
   flies; put up with them patiently. When these have gone others will
   come and must be endured in the same spirit of patience and
   resignation.

   I bless God for the holy interior dispositions of sacrifice,
   abandonment, death to self, and complete annihilation with which He
   inspires you. How can you for one moment imagine that God, Who is so
   good, would abandon you, when by such a singular change He accomplishes
   in you such wonderful operations, and favours you as He favours the
   saints? Indeed, what could He give you more in conformity with the holy
   Gospel, more sanctifying, or in any way better. Ecstasies and
   revelations are nothing compared to these interior dispositions of
   abjection, because it is precisely in these that sanctity and
   perfection consist. I can only urge you to let nothing be lost of these
   precious gifts by contrary acts, but when God is pleased to deprive
   you, apparently, of them, in taking away all these feelings, allow Him
   to do it. Let Him give, take away, and give again. Is He not Master of
   His gifts? His holy name be always equally praised.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter X.--Fear of Making No Progress.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On the fear of making no progress,
   and of not doing enough penance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Do not be astonished, my dear Sister, at making apparently so little
   progress. One does not ever advance in spiritual as one does in visible
   works. The business of our sanctification and perfection ought to be
   the work of our whole life-time. I notice that your natural vivacity
   and eagerness intrude into everything, and from this proceed anxieties,
   discouragement, and troubles which lead you astray in causing you
   distress. Here is the remedy! As long as you feel a sincere good-will
   to belong to God, a practical appreciation for everything that leads
   you to God, and a certain amount of courage to rise after your little
   falls, you are doing well in the sight of God. Have patience with
   yourself then; learn to bear with your own weaknesses and miseries
   gently, as you have to put up with those of your neighbour. Be
   satisfied to humble yourself quietly before God, and do not expect to
   make any progress except through Him. This hope will not be
   disappointed, but God will realise probably by a hidden operation which
   will take place in the centre of your soul, and this will cause it to
   make considerable progress without your knowledge.

   You are uneasy about your penance. Oh! my dear daughter, how could you
   perform a better penance, and one in which there is less of your own
   will than to bear patiently the crosses that come from God? Besides,
   all our crosses come certainly from Him when they are the necessary,
   natural, and inevitable consequences of the state in which divine
   Providence permits us to be settled. These are the heaviest crosses,
   but also the most sanctifying because they all come from God. Crosses
   from our heavenly Father, crosses from divine Providence, how much
   easier to bear they are than those we fashion for ourselves, and
   embrace voluntarily. Then love yours, my dear Sister, since they have
   been prepared for you by God alone for each day. Let Him do this; He
   alone knows what is suitable for each one of us. If we remain firm in
   this, submissive and humbled under all the crosses sent by God, we
   shall find in them, at last, rest for our souls. Thus we shall enjoy an
   unshaken peace when, by our submission, we shall have merited from God
   to be made to feel that divine unction which belongs to, and is a part
   of the cross since Jesus Christ died upon it for us. But you ask how
   the spiritual life can be compatible with this state of trouble and
   darkness. Ah! my dear daughter, how many are mistaken about this! Do
   not you share their delusion. The spiritual life, gentle, and tranquil
   as I have always described it to you to inspire you with a taste for
   it, is only to be found in two sorts of persons; first, in those who
   are entirely separated from the world and have nothing to do with its
   affairs; secondly, sometimes, but more rarely, in persons living in the
   world, when by dint of having overcome themselves, and detached
   themselves from everything, they live in the world, but are not of it;
   that is to say they belong to it outwardly, but not in mind and heart.
   But this absence of business and of care if far from constituting the
   essential part of the spiritual life, or from forming its merit. There
   is another sort of interior life, which, devoid of sweetness, is on
   this account all the more meritorious, and it is to this that you must
   conform yourself; the other may follow later. This interior life may
   also be divided under two heads, first, the generous fulfilment of the
   divine will whenever manifested to us either by the precepts it has
   itself laid down for us, or by our Rule, or by the commands or desires
   of our Superiors; secondly, to receive everything as coming from the
   hand of God, whether business affairs, adversity, illness,
   difficulties, or annoyances. Sometimes, however, one forgets oneself.
   You must expect this to happen. What is to be done then? You know what,
   return quietly to yourself, regain your tranquillity with
   submissiveness, humble yourself gently before God, never be discouraged
   nor disheartened, and above all take good care, according to the
   teaching of St. Francis of Sales, not to be grieved at having been
   grieved, nor to be angry at having been angry, nor worried at having
   been worried, because this would be to go from bad to worse, and would
   augment still more the interior trouble. This is the rock ahead of
   lively persons.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XI.--On Fears About Confession.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I can only repeat to-day, my dear Sister, what I have so often told you
   before. God wishes to make you do penance and to sanctify you by the
   endurance of personal offences that wound you, by interior crosses, and
   more especially by troubles of conscience. I only ask you in all these
   trials for a little submission and resignation such as you practice in
   the different circumstances of life, such as losses, illnesses,
   infirmities, etc. I forbid you to dwell voluntarily on the uneasiness
   that torments you with regard to your confessions. Be at peace. Blind
   obedience can never deceive you. As for contrition which is the only
   thing that you might have some reason to fear about; if you mention in
   each confession a sin of your past life without going into details you
   will have absolutely nothing to fear. The best sign of having true
   contrition is to fall no more into grave sins, and to do your best to
   get rid of those that are lighter. Therefore remain in peace on this
   point, enduring patiently the different returns of these troubles. As
   you are infirm these troubles will do instead of fasting or taking the
   discipline, or wearing a hair shirt, but with this difference, that
   whereas in these latter penitential exercises self-love can be met with
   again and satisfied, in the former penances sent by our heavenly Father
   to men and women for whose salvation He has a special desire, there is
   only the pure will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XII.--Rules to Free Oneself from these Fears.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It depends on yourself, my dear Sister, to free yourself once and for
   all from the fears which torment you on the subject of your
   confessions. It only requires a grain of faith and of docility in
   following the perfectly safe rules that I will outline for you.

   1st. Never ask to be freed from this trouble, because God has made it
   perfectly clear to you why He permits it. It is because He wishes to be
   your only support, your sole consolation, and to have your complete
   confidence so that no other sensible motive may interfere to spoil the
   singleness of your love. Finding that you had not the courage to attain
   to this purity of love by making heroic sacrifices like the saints, He
   leads you gradually to it by less painful means. Return thanks to Him
   for so much condescension, and compel yourself to submit to His
   merciful designs.

   2nd. Prepare for your confessions in the following manner. After a
   quarter of an hour at the very utmost for the examen, and without
   taking too much trouble but doing it as you best can, you will say to
   yourself, "By the mercy of God I live in a state of habitual contrition
   since I would not commit a mortal sin for anything this world could
   give me. I even feel a horror of venial sin, although, unhappily, I
   have not yet left off committing it; therefore I only have to make an
   act of contrition as best I can, and as He has put it into my heart by
   His grace." That will not take long, a few minutes will suffice, and
   the best way to make acts of contrition is to pray that God will
   Himself produce them in you.

   3rd. "But what if it should be impossible to remember any distinct
   fault?" This is what you must say: "Father, I have not light enough to
   see my ordinary faults but I accuse myself in general of all the sins
   of my past life, and particularly of such and such a sin of which I ask
   pardon of God from the bottom of my heart." After that accept
   tranquilly the penance that your confessor gives you, and do not have
   any doubt whatever that the absolution he pronounces confers on you all
   the graces attached to this sacrament.

   What on earth, I ask you, could be easier or more consoling? If you
   adopt this method you will be delivered from all the anxieties that
   have so much harassed you up to now. I should like this little rule to
   be known and practised by most of the members of your community who
   experience the same difficulty as yourself, and who, like you, could so
   easily be set right.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIII.--On Fears About Contrition.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You desire the impossible, my dear Sister, you want to feel what is not
   perceptible by the senses, and to enjoy a certainty that we cannot
   possess during this life. True contrition which remits sin is, of its
   nature, entirely spiritual and consequently above the senses. It is
   true that with certain persons and on certain occasions it becomes
   sometimes sensible, and then it is much more consoling to self-love,
   but is not on that account either more efficacious, or more
   meritorious. This tenderness of feeling does not in any way depend upon
   us, neither is it by any means essential for obtaining the remission of
   our sins. A great number of souls truly devoted to God hardly ever
   experience this tenderness, and the fear inspired in them by this
   deprivation is the best proof that they are not responsible for it. The
   coldness they feel, far from depriving them of true repentance is, on
   the contrary, one of the best penances they could offer to God. What I
   now say on the subject of contrition in general, I say in particular
   about the sovereignty of this sorrow, a quality that is usually the one
   least felt. It must be asked of God and you must wait till He produces
   it Himself in your heart by His grace. To persist in tormenting
   yourself after this would be to allow yourself to fall into the devil's
   trap. Nothing should astonish us less than to be sometimes touched and
   affected, and at others to find ourselves callous and insensible to
   everything. This is one of the inevitable vicissitudes of the spiritual
   life. Fiat! fiat! resignation is the only remedy. It is certain that
   God always gives what is necessary to those souls who fear Him. The
   gifts He bestows on them are not always the most apparent to the
   senses, nor the most agreeable, nor the most sought after, but the most
   necessary and solid; all the more so, usually, in being less felt and
   more mortifying to self-love; for that which helps us most powerfully
   to live to God is what best enables us to die to self.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIV.--On General Confession.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet. On general confession.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Your fears have no reasonable foundation, and you ought to reject them
   as dangerous temptations. When, in the course of one's life one has
   made a general confession in good faith; all the ideas and anxieties
   that follow are so many idle scruples which the enemy makes use of to
   trouble the peace of the soul, to make one lose time, and to weaken and
   diminish one's confidence in God. Do not let us foolishly fall into
   this trap; let us abandon all the past to the infinite mercy of God,
   all the future to His fatherly Providence, and think only of profiting
   by the present. The "fiat" formed in the mind by repeated acts and
   gradually reduced to an habitual disposition, leads to all that
   perfection which ignorant and mistaken people seek far and wide in all
   sorts of ways. For the rest, do not imagine that you tire me by
   speaking of your miseries. By dint of seeing nothing but poverty and
   misery in oneself, one is not surprised at finding the same in others.
   But if, in peace and humility they annihilate themselves before God and
   ask for grace, working with His assistance to diminish their faults and
   to overcome themselves, they may be considered, in a way, not to have
   these faults. This is what Fénélon thought. May it sink deeply into
   your heart as well as this sentence which I find in the same author,
   and which I copy for you because I think it is exactly what will
   console and encourage you. "We are obliged to live and to die in the
   deepest uncertainty, not only as to the judgments of God about us, but
   also as to our own dispositions." "We must," says St. Augustine, "have
   nothing of our own to present to God but our own miseries, but then we
   have His very great mercy which is our only title to His love, through
   the merits of Jesus Christ." Often reflect on these beautiful sayings
   in which you will find peace for your mind, abandonment, confidence,
   and the greatest certainty in the very midst of doubt.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XV.--Different Fears.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On the same subject--Different
   fears.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   As neither my advice nor my efforts can deliver you from your fears
   about your confessions I can see nothing for you but to resign yourself
   to them. Regard these troubles as a penance sent you by your heavenly
   Father, but never stop to think about them voluntarily because I am
   convinced that in your general confession you mentioned everything; or,
   at any rate, you had a sincere desire to say everything; that is
   enough. I do not hesitate to assure you, before God, that in this
   confession no omission of any importance could have been made,
   therefore remain in peace about it.

   You are still distressed that certain sublime states that you admire in
   others, you can neither dare to ask for, nor even to desire for
   yourself. Here are two remedies to alleviate your trouble and to make
   you derive advantages from your weakness. Firstly, to humble yourself,
   and to lament interiorly, but without vexation, at beholding yourself
   so far from such holy dispositions. Secondly to desire interiorly to
   have the wish for them. This desire to desire is the first degree from
   which one passes gradually to a real desire, and this in its turn by
   dint of being renewed and of dwelling in the heart gets stronger and
   finally takes root. Try to recall often to your mind this great rule:
   God has placed me in this world only to know, love and serve Him, and
   could not have created me for any other purpose, therefore I will
   attain this end to the best of my power. For the rest He may do with me
   what best pleases Him, I abandon myself entirely to His holy will which
   can only will my salvation and eternal happiness in the life to come.
   It is for this only that He makes me endure so many interior and
   exterior afflictions. May he be blessed for ever!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVI.--Hatred of Sin.

   On the same subject. Different fears.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   In all that forms the subject of your letter I see no reason for alarm.
   You are not pleased, you say, about your want of submission and of
   patience during suffering. Provided that this discontent does not turn
   to vexation, trouble, or discouragement, it will inspire you with a
   sincere interior humility, a profound self-contempt which will please
   God better and enable you to make more progress than a patience and
   submission that you felt that you possessed, which would perhaps have
   only served to feed self-love by almost imperceptible satisfactions.
   You cannot yet, you say, make known to me anything else but miseries. I
   can well believe it, since as long as we are in this life we cannot
   find anything in ourselves but what is imperfect and miserable. Do you
   want a remedy for all these miseries? It is this: While detesting the
   sins that are the cause of them, love, or at least accept their
   consequences which are the feeling of abjection and a contempt for
   yourself; but do so without trouble, vexation, uneasiness or
   discouragement. Remember that God, without willing sin, has made of it
   a very useful instrument for keeping us always in a state of abjection
   and self-contempt. Without this bitter remedy we should succumb to the
   enticements of self-love. Believe me, you must always keep cheerful,
   steadfast and tranquil in the midst of your miseries, making at the
   same time efforts to diminish them; as you advance further you will
   constantly discover fresh ones. It was this clear knowledge of their
   own weakness and nothingness, which, becoming ever more distinct,
   increased the humility of the saints; but this humility by God's grace
   is always joyful and peaceful. It goes so far as to make them love
   spiritual poverty which in this way becomes a real treasure. Learn that
   under this heap of refuse God hides the gifts He bestows on us to
   conceal them from the satisfactions of self-love and foolish esteem. I
   do not blame your tears but I wish that while you are shedding them
   over your pains you would do so before God and for His sake. In this
   way instead of feeling their bitterness you would discover in them a
   hidden sweetness which would tend to increase interior peace by
   producing an entire submission to the divine will.

   As for the supposed want of contrition which distresses you, you need
   see in it only a trap laid for you by the devil to destroy your peace.
   Do you not know that an apparently bitter contrition accompanied by
   torrents of tears is not the best, and that God by no means exacts such
   from you? With all these beautiful signs true contrition may be
   wanting; and, on the contrary, without any feelings of the sort one can
   have the contrition that justifies. This consists in the will to hate
   and to avoid sin, and resides in the superior faculties of the soul and
   consequently is not to be felt as it is purely spiritual. Remain then
   in peace and do not attend to your self-love which wants to feel and to
   enjoy this contrition so as to be certain of possessing it. God does
   not desire this for several reasons, but above all to keep us always in
   holy humility, and in a certain fear which helps towards our salvation.
   Enter into His designs, and when you feel no regret for your sins
   humble yourself profoundly. Offer to God in a spirit of penance this
   keen dread of not possessing the requisite sorrow; make a sacrifice of
   this trouble of mind to God, and abandon yourself entirely to His
   mercy; He intends to lead you by the way of obscurity and fear, to
   Heaven. The greatest saints themselves have no exemption from this law
   but, more faithful than we, they abandoned themselves entirely to God
   and, by placing their whole confidence in Him kept themselves always in
   peace. As for the review of conscience that souls careful of their
   state are in the habit of making at least every year, one must remember
   that it is not a matter of obligation but a work of devotion and
   humility. Each person gives to this examination as long a time as he
   desires, with the advice of the confessor, and one can always be
   certain of saying more than is necessary. At the hour of death there is
   no necessity to make a general confession. One can accuse oneself of
   the graver sins in a general way out of compunction, or in a spirit of
   penance, but without too much introspection. It is much better to
   occupy the time in making more meritorious acts of religion, of faith,
   hope, contrition and love of God, of resignation, abandonment, and
   confidence in the merits of Jesus Christ, and of union with Him.
   Finally the most solid preparation for death is that which we make
   every day, by a regular life, a spirit of recollection, of
   annihilation, of abnegation, patience, charity, and union with our
   Lord.

   I do not like to find you attaching so much importance to the little
   comforts that are given you in your illnesses, such as getting up a
   little later, having your bed warmed, eating a little more at the
   collation. Follow in all this, with the greatest simplicity, discretion
   and obedience and without thinking too much about yourself, what you
   feel and judge to be necessary. Provided also that the interior
   passions are thoroughly overcome, and that you are not wanting in
   patience, submission and a total abandonment to God, in gentleness and
   humble forbearance with your neighbour, for these are the most
   essential virtues and more sanctifying than any exterior
   mortifications. People who are rather pious are not wanting in outward
   practices; usually, their great mistake is to make their whole sanctity
   consist in external works, leaving the enemy, namely, self-love and the
   passions, alone. They make a great to-do about having eaten a few
   mouthfuls extra on a feast-day but will not attend to these essential
   things. Such piety is like that of the Jews who had a scruple about
   entering Pilate's house because he was a pagan, yet thought nothing of
   putting Jesus to death. Would to God that these deplorable illusions
   were never found among Religious. At any rate do you, my dear Sister,
   avoid them, and without neglecting what is external, give your
   principal attention to the interior.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVII.--Remorse and Rebellion.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen. On remorse of conscience and the
   rebellion of the passions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Do all you can to calm your soul on the subject about which you have
   consulted me, first because the motives which you believe you have to
   make you uneasy have no foundation in fact. The only danger lies in the
   uneasiness itself.

   When the reproaches of your conscience, however well merited they may
   be, throw you into a state of trouble and depression; when they
   discourage and upset you, it is certain that they come from the devil
   who only fishes in troubled waters, says St. Francis of Sales. The
   first care of a soul experiencing these troubles ought to be to prevent
   them, to stifle them, or better still to despise them. Let it say with
   St. Teresa, "What my weakness finds impossible, will become easy with
   the help of the grace of God, and this He will give me in His own good
   time. For the rest, I desire neither perfection, nor to lead a
   spiritual life, except as far as it should please God to give them to
   me and at the time He has appointed to do so." You must try to acquire
   a habit of making these two acts by a constant repetition of them in
   your heart. The second will contribute marvellously to reproduce entire
   abandonment, which is the special attraction of souls desiring to
   belong unreservedly to God.

   2nd. The rebellion of the passions, and that excessive sensitiveness
   which causes one to be put out beyond measure on the slightest
   provocation ought not to disquiet, nor to discourage anyone suffering
   from them, nor to make her think that her desire of sanctification is
   not sincere. This mistake and the discouragement it occasions are more
   harmful than all the other temptations. To get rid of them, or to
   overcome them we must be well persuaded that these rebellions, and this
   extreme sensitiveness are sent to us by God to be the ground of our
   combats and victories; and that these little falls are permitted to
   help us to practise humility. Looked upon in this light our falls will
   be incomparably more useful to us than victories spoilt by vain
   self-complacency. This is a very certain and a very encouraging truth.
   We must be convinced, thoroughly convinced that our miseries are the
   cause of all the weakness we experience, and that God, in His mercy,
   allows them for our good. Without them we should never be cured of a
   secret presumption and a proud confidence in ourselves. Never should we
   be able to rightly understand that all that is bad is ours, and that
   all that is good is from God alone. To acquire a habit of thinking thus
   it is necessary to pass through a great number of personal experiences,
   and there is a greater necessity for this the more deeply rooted these
   vices are, and the greater the hold they have on the soul.

   3rd. You must never feel surprised at finding that a day of great
   recollection is followed by one full of dissipation; this is the usual
   condition in this present life. These changes are necessary, even in
   spiritual things, to keep us in humility, and a state of dependence on
   God. The saints themselves have passed through these alternations, and
   others still more troublesome. Only try not to give rise to them
   yourself; but should this, unfortunately, happen, then humble yourself
   peacefully and without vexation, which would be a worse evil than the
   original one; then endeavour to regain self-control, and to return to
   God; doing so quietly without over-eagerness, and by means of a total
   holy abandonment to God's ways.

   4th. Your present method of prayer is good; continue to practise it.
   The humble feelings of the heart, the submissive attitude of the soul
   before God are worth more than a multitude of formal acts constantly
   reiterated; they are acts straight from the heart, stronger and more
   efficacious with God although not always so sensibly felt, nor as
   clearly perceived, nor as consoling as the former. God takes from us
   this multiplicity to give us instead something better, more simple and
   better calculated to unite us to Him.

   5th. The person of whom you speak is not wanting in the love of God.
   She has as much as is necessary, but God has deprived her of the
   knowledge of it for fear that she should pride herself on it, and in
   order to prevent her preferring the sensible pleasure of it, to Him who
   ought to be its sole object. Let her be consoled about this, while at
   the same time she should always desire to love Him more without wishing
   to know it, or to be able to be certain of it.

   6th. The opposition and perpetual contradiction between your thoughts
   and feelings is nothing else than that inner strife spoken of by the
   Apostle when he says, "the spirit wars against the flesh, and the flesh
   against the spirit." None of the saints have been exempt from this
   rule. It is true that this interior war is more violent with some
   people, and about some things more than others, and also at a certain
   age, or time or occasion, but whether more or less violent, no harm is
   done to a soul that fights with a determination never to be beaten nor
   discouraged. On the other hand, the greater the violence of the attacks
   the more serious are the combats, and consequently, the more glorious
   the victories. The greater the merit, the higher the sanctity, and the
   grander the recompense. These happy results are all the more certain
   the less they are felt, and especially if a more profound humiliation
   is experienced.

   Oh! if only this interior abjection were accepted, loved and valued, no
   one would consent to be without it, because it brings the soul nearer
   to God. This great God has, in fact, declared that He draws near to
   those who humble themselves and who love to be humiliated. If it is
   good for us to be humbled in the sight of others it is no less useful
   to be annihilated in our own eyes, in our pride and self-love which are
   put an end to in this way. It is thus, in fact, that they are gradually
   extinguished in us, and for this purpose does God permit so many
   different subjects for interior humiliation. It only remains to know
   how to profit by them, by following the advice of St. Francis of Sales,
   and practising acts of true humility, gently and peacefully; and this
   will drive out false humility which is always in a state of vexation
   and spite. Vexation and spite under humiliation are so many acts of
   pride, just as worry and irritation during suffering are so many acts
   of impatience. Let us not forget this, and let us take good care not to
   look upon the want of feeling we experience for the things of God as
   callousness; it is simply dryness, and a trial as inevitable and
   ordinary as distractions. If it is constant it is a still better sign,
   because it is in this way that God prepares the soul to proceed by pure
   faith, the most sure and meritorious way.

   One should repeat continually to anyone in this state, "Peace, peace,
   remain in peace, and keep retired within your soul." Preserve a
   constant desire of the interior life. This single attraction ought to
   suffice to make you live within yourself, and in constant communication
   with God. The results will follow in their own time. Guard above all
   against anything likely to withdraw you from this good disposition;
   avoid all occasions of losing it; humble yourself when you have failed
   about it, but do not ever worry yourself, nor distress yourself about
   anything whatever, nothing could harm you more than that.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XVIII.--God Alone can Remove These Trials.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. God alone can remove these trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. To alleviate your troubles and regrets, my dear Sister, I have
   only two things to say to you. Everything comes from God, and, on our
   part, all merit consists in acquiescing in the will of God. Whether
   willingly or by compulsion it will always be accomplished; let us unite
   ourselves to it with all the strength of our own will, and thus we
   shall have nothing to fear. Anguish of the heart, and involuntary
   rebellion only augment the merit of submission. If you fear lest you do
   not possess this virtue, ask God to grant it to you, saying to Him
   interiorly, "Lord, I desire and will to have this entire submission and
   I offer you the anguish by which I am tormented in union with the agony
   of Jesus Christ Your beloved Son in the garden."

   2nd. Try to avoid all useless reflexions which only embitter the heart.
   When, in spite of yourself, you feel irritated, bear this trouble
   patiently, and when you feel impatient, then is the time to make
   greater efforts to have patience in enduring this impatience itself,
   and to resign yourself to the want of resignation.

   3rd. Read in the book of the "Holy Ways of the Cross," the chapters
   which bear upon your present state. You will find therein all the
   instruction, support, and consolation which you can possibly require,
   but do not expect to find in them what no one on earth can possibly
   give you. God alone can remove this trial from you, wait His time with
   patience. You have always counted too much on human help; God has taken
   it away from you to compel you no longer to depend on anyone but Him
   alone, by abandoning yourself entirely to His paternal care. The more
   painful and violent your trial is, the more certain do I become about
   your salvation and perfection. You will be able to understand this
   later just as I do.

   4th. As Jesus Christ crucified is our only model, and as He wishes to
   save us by making us like to Himself, He strews crosses in the path of
   each one of us in order to keep us in the way of salvation. If we are
   faithful the reverses that cross our lives will form our riches. And
   see how great is the mercy of our loving Saviour; after having passed
   through the most severe trials, and accomplished the most painful
   sacrifices, what is left seems hardly to count, and the heaviest
   crosses begin to seem quite light. Oh! happy experience, as sweet in
   its effects as, at first, is appeared difficult to nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIX.--On Relapses.

   To the same Sister. On the same subject and on relapses.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   The recital you have given me of your troubles, and, above all of your
   faults and interior revolts, has inspired me with the most lively
   compassion; but, as to a remedy I really know of no other than that
   which I have so often pointed out to you; each time you have a fresh
   proof of your misery to humble yourself, to offer all to God, and to
   have patience. If you fall again do not be any the more disquieted or
   troubled the second time than the first, but humble yourself yet more
   profoundly and do not fail to offer especially to God the interior
   suffering and confusion caused by the revolts and faults to which your
   weakness has given rise. Even if fresh occasions occur, return each
   time to God with an equal confidence, and endure as patiently as
   possible the renewed remorse of conscience and these interior trials
   and rebellions, and continue to act in this way. If you always do so
   you must understand that you will hardly lose anything, there will be
   much even gained in these involuntary interior rebellions from which
   you are suffering. Whatever faults occur, provided you endeavour always
   to return to God and also to yourself in the manner I have just
   explained, it is impossible that you should not make great progress.
   Oh! how little are solid virtue and true interior abnegation known! If
   once for all you would learn to humble yourself sincerely for your
   least faults, and would rise directly by confidence in God with peace
   and sweetness, that would prove to you a good and certain remedy for
   the past, and a powerful help, and efficacious protection for the
   future.

   I greatly approve of your keeping away from discussions and arguments,
   and of your dislike of them. There certainly is, as a rule, a great
   amount of petty illusions and self-love about such things, for this
   wretched self-love, says St. Francis of Sales, mixes with everything,
   intrudes everywhere, spoils everything. This is the effect of human
   misery to which we are all more or less subject. When we recognise it
   in others there are two things we have to do; first we must find
   excuses for those whom we notice to have been led away by it, and
   secondly to fear for ourselves and watch over our own conduct so that
   we may not in our turn be subjects of scandal to our neighbour.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XX.--Depression under Trials.

   To the same Sister (1738). On depression during trials, distractions
   and resentment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. You would be mistaken, my dear Sister, to reproach yourself too
   much for your want of resignation, because I do not consider it at all
   voluntary. Great afflictions are inevitably followed by a certain
   depression; but those souls that are faithful to God rise again quietly
   by their confidence and filial abandonment to divine Providence. It
   seems, sometimes, as if it were impossible to do this, or at any rate
   to do it properly, but one must not be discouraged on this account.
   Better indeed to make of this weakness itself a subject for renewed
   acts of resignation to the divine goodness and to remain peacefully and
   patiently in one's own nothingness. Thus we shall fulfil the designs of
   God who permits us to fall into this state of depression and weakness
   to make us better understand and feel our misery. He wills that there
   should not be in us the least atom of confidence in ourselves, but that
   we should rely solely on His all-powerful grace.

   2nd. I ought to tell you that for a long time past I have remarked in
   you a great grace to which you pay no attention. You seem to me to
   become ever more deeply convinced of your miseries and imperfections.
   Now that happens only in proportion to our nearness to God, and to the
   light in which we live and walk, without any consideration of our own.
   This divine light as it shines more brightly makes us see better and
   feel more keenly the abyss of misery and corruption within us, and this
   knowledge is one of the surest signs of progress in the ways of God and
   of the spiritual life. You ought to think rather more of this, not to
   pride yourself on it, but to be grateful for it. Nothing more is
   necessary at present but to strive to love holy abjection, poverty, and
   horror of yourself which begins in this deep knowledge experienced by
   you. When you have attained this you will have taken a fresh step still
   more decided towards your spiritual advancement. See then how great is
   the goodness of God! He makes use of the sight that you have of your
   poverty to enrich you. This poverty becomes a treasure to those who
   understand, accept, and love it, because it is the will of God. This
   joyful acquiescence in our misery does not exclude, however, the desire
   of finding a remedy for it, because, if we ought to love the abjection
   which is the result of our defects, we ought at the same time to hate
   the defects themselves, and to make use of the most energetic means of
   getting rid of them.

   3rd. Urgent occupations and the interruptions of worldly business are,
   in the sight of divine Providence who wills and permits them, of equal
   value as quiet recollection and silence. Instead of the prayer of quiet
   you then make a prayer of patience, of suffering and of resignation.
   "But one sometimes loses patience"; well, this is the distraction of
   this prayer, and you must try to regain it, and to get calm with the
   thought that God wills or permits what upsets you, and causes you pain;
   but above all take great care not to lose your temper at feeling
   impatient, or to get worried at being upset. By humbling yourself
   quietly you will gain more than you have lost.

   4th. I need not enter into minute details as regards the keen pain you
   describe. I understand all the different distressing thoughts that fill
   your mind and all the heart-ache they cause, but here again, my dear
   daughter, is an excellent prayer more sanctifying than any ecstasies,
   if you know how to make use of it. How can you do so? In this way. (1)
   Often pray for the person who is the cause of your trouble. (2) Keep
   perfectly silent, do not speak about it to anyone to relieve your pain.
   (3) Do not voluntarily think about it but turn your thoughts to other
   subjects that are holy and useful. (4) Watch over your heart that you
   may not give way in the very least bit to bitterness, spite,
   complaints, or voluntary rebellion. (5) Try to speak well of the
   person, cost what it may, to regard her favourably, to act about her as
   if nothing had happened. I realise, however, that you will find it
   difficult in future to treat her with the same confidence without being
   a saint, which you are not yet. (6) But at least do not fail to render
   her a service when occasion arises and to wish her all possible good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXI.--On Humble Silence and Patience During Trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Take courage, my dear Sister, and do not imagine that you are far from
   God; on the contrary you have never been so near Him. Recall to your
   mind the agony of our Lord in the Garden of Olives, and you will
   understand that bitterness of feeling and violent anguish are not
   incompatible with perfect submission. They are the groanings of
   suffering nature and signs of the hardness of the sacrifice. To do
   nothing at such a time contrary to the order of God, to utter no word
   of complaint or of distress, is indeed perfect submission which
   proceeds from love, and love of the purest description. Oh! if you only
   knew how in these circumstances to do nothing, to say nothing, to
   remain in humble silence full of respect, of faith, of adoration, of
   submission, abandonment and sacrifice, you would have discovered the
   great secret of sanctifying all your sufferings, and even of lessening
   them considerably. You must practise this and acquire the habit of it
   quietly, taking great care not to give way to trouble and
   discouragement should you fail, but at once return to complete silence
   with a peaceful and tranquil humility. For the rest, depend with
   unshaken confidence on the help of grace, which will not be refused to
   you. When God sends us great crosses and finds that we sincerely desire
   to bear them well for the love of Him, He never fails to support us
   invisibly, and in such a way that according to the greatness of the
   cross will be the amount of resignation and interior peace, sometimes
   indeed even greater, so immense is the bounty of Jesus Christ, our
   Master, and of the spiritual graces He has merited for us. Let us
   conclude with this--that nearly everything consists in having a good
   will; and to make our spiritual progress assured God will mercifully do
   the rest. Knowing the full extent of our weakness, misery, and
   incapacity for doing anything good, He sustains and fortifies us,
   working this good in us Himself by His divine Spirit. The practice of
   accepting at each moment the present state in which God places us, can
   keep us in peace of mind and cause us to make great progress without
   undue eagerness. Besides this it is a very simple practice. We should
   adhere to it strongly but nevertheless with an entire resignation to
   whatever God requires about it.

   A great sign that we are not deceived about our love of God is:
   Firstly, when we desire all that pleases Him, and secondly when we have
   a great horror of sin, even the least, and strive never to commit any
   deliberately. Since God has given you the grace to take my favourite
   maxims to heart concerning submission, abandonment and sacrifice, be
   assured that He will enable you to practise them, however imperfectly.
   But as you are so impetuous about everything, you want to attain at one
   bound to the highest perfection in these virtues. That cannot be, you
   must attain to them gradually and even while committing many small
   faults which will serve to humble you, and to make you realise your
   great weakness before God. Interior rebellion in these circumstances
   does not prevent submission in the higher part of the soul. Read often
   the 57th letter in the third book by St. Francis of Sales. This letter
   has always charmed me. It will make clear to you the distinction
   between the two wills in the soul, the exact knowledge of which is an
   essential point in the spiritual life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXII.--To Bear With Oneself.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On the realisation of her misery
   and on exterior difficulties.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I might say to you, my dear Sister, what our Lord said to Martha! Why
   so much solicitude and trouble? How can you still confound, as you do,
   the care that God commands you to take about your salvation, with the
   uneasiness that He reproves? As you try to abandon your temporal
   affairs to divine Providence while taking care at the same time not to
   tempt God; do the same for your spiritual progress, and, without
   neglecting the care of it, leave the success to God, hoping for nothing
   except from Him. But do not ever dwell on such diabolical thoughts as:
   I am always the same, always as little recollected, as dissipated, as
   impatient, as imperfect. All this afflicts the soul, overwhelms the
   heart and casts you into sadness, distrust and discouragement. This is
   what the devil desires; by this pretended humility and regret for your
   faults he is delighted to deprive you of the strength of which you have
   need for the purpose of avoiding them in future, and of repairing the
   harm they have done you. Bitterness spoils everything and on the
   contrary gentleness and sweetness can cure everything. Bear with
   yourself therefore patiently, return quietly to God, repent tranquilly,
   without either exterior or interior impetuosity but with great peace.
   If you act thus you will gradually become calm, and this practice will
   cause you to make more progress in the ways of God than all your
   agitations could possibly effect. When one feels a little peace and
   sweetness interiorly it is a pleasure to enter into oneself and one
   does so willingly, constantly, without any trouble, almost without
   reflexion.

   Believe me, my dear Sister, and place your whole confidence in God
   through Jesus Christ; abandon yourself more and more entirely to Him,
   in all, and for all, and you will find by your own experience that He
   will always come to your assistance when you require His help. He will
   become your Master, your Guide, your Support, your Protector, your
   invincible Upholder. Then nothing will be wanting to you because,
   possessing God you possess all, and to possess Him you have but to
   apply to Him with the greatest confidence, to have recourse to Him for
   everything great and small without any reserve, and to speak to Him
   with the greatest simplicity in this way: "Lord, what shall I do on
   such an occasion? What shall I say? Speak, Lord, I am listening; I
   abandon myself entirely to You; enlighten me, lead me, uphold me, take
   possession of me."

   I am sorry for the difficulties and worries of which you tell me, but
   recollect that patience and submission to God in the midst of
   annoyances that are permitted by His providence will enable you to make
   more progress than the quietest and most recollected life. The latter
   always tends to flatter self-love; the former, on the contrary,
   afflicts and crucifies it, and thus makes us attain true peace of mind
   by union with God. When you find yourself in such utter dejection that
   you cannot make a single act of any virtue whatever, beware of
   tormenting yourself by violent efforts but keep simply in the presence
   of God in a great silence of utter misery, but with respect, humility
   and submission like a criminal before his judge who sentences him to a
   chastisement he has well merited: and understand that the interior
   silence of respect, humility and submission are worth more and purify
   better than all the acts that you, uselessly, force yourself to make,
   and which only serve to increase the trouble of the soul. The character
   of the person to whom you allude is very good, I own; but while
   praising God for all the good gifts He has bestowed upon her you ought
   not to despise the share He has given to you. On the contrary, by your
   submission to, and respect for the designs of God you must wish to be
   such as He wishes you to be, without, however, neglecting to correct
   yourself. The greatest improvement I desire to see in you is, that your
   mind may never get embittered for any reason whatever, and that you
   always treat yourself gently. Is it not true that you behave thus
   towards your neighbours? You are not always reproaching them bitterly
   and continually about their characters, but you try gently to induce
   them to reform. Do the same to yourself, and if gradually this spirit
   of gentleness should take root in your heart you would soon make
   progress in the spiritual life and without so much trouble. But if the
   heart is continually filled with feelings of harshness and bitterness,
   nothing much can be achieved and everything costs great effort. I
   insist greatly in this matter because it is an essential one for you,
   and in your place I should apply myself seriously to acquire a great
   interior and exterior gentleness in all things just as if there were no
   other virtue to practise; for this will, in your case, bring all the
   others in its train. I appeal to your own experience about it. After
   having worked at it for some time very quietly, without the
   interruption of those impetuosities and hurries which drive away all
   sweetness and prevent you gaining the victory, you should be able to
   recognise the fact, that in this way much more is gained without half
   the fatigue.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXIII.--On Past Sins.

   To the same Sister. Alby, July the 23rd, 1733.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister, and very dear daughter in our Lord.

   May the peace of Jesus Christ be always with you!

   1st. I have never said anything with the meaning that you impute to me,
   but have only written as to a poor beginner whom God is afflicting in
   His mercy, in order to purify her and to prepare her for union with
   Him. The terrible ideas you have about your past disorders are at
   present what you are called to and you must bear with them as long as
   God pleases, just as one keeps to attractions that are full of
   sweetness. This keen realisation of your poverty and darkness gives me
   pleasure, because I know it is a sure sign that divine light is
   increasing in you without your knowledge and is forming a sure
   foundation of true humility. The time will come when the sight of these
   miseries which now cause you horror, will overwhelm you with joy, and
   fill you with a profound and delightful peace. It is not till we have
   reached the bottom of the abyss of our nothingness, and are firmly
   established there that we can, as Holy Scripture says, "walk before God
   in justice and truth." Just as pride, which is founded on a lie,
   prevents God from bestowing favours on a soul that is otherwise rich in
   merit, so this happy condition of humiliation willingly accepted, and
   of annihilation truly appreciated, draws down divine graces on even the
   most wretched of souls. Therefore do not desire any other condition
   either during life or at the hour of death. It is in this state of
   voluntary annihilation that you should have taken refuge, to escape the
   fears that assailed you during your recent illness. Do not fail to do
   so if Satan ever tries to catch you in the same trap. Self-love desires
   to have, at the last hours, some sensible support in the recollection
   of past good works; let us, however, desire no other support than that
   given us by pure faith in the mercy of God and in the merits of Jesus
   Christ. From the moment that we wish to belong entirely to God this
   support will be enough for us, all the rest is nothing but vanity.

   2nd. I approve, for the rest, of your interior and exterior conduct
   during your illness. I perceive that God, in His wisdom, hid what
   little good He enabled you to gain from it because unless He had done
   so, a thousand vain thoughts of self-complacency would have spoilt all.
   I know better than you all that took place and I bless God for it. He
   supported you well in your weakness; you have only to thank Him for
   doing so without reflecting so much as to whether everything has really
   been supernatural. Leave that to God; only try to forget yourself and
   to think only of Him.

   3rd. What business have you to find so many excuses for your melancholy
   disposition? Let everyone think what he likes about it, you have only
   to please God and whatever He permits others to think or to say about
   you is of no moment to you; therefore do not indulge in reflexions on
   the subject. All that sort of thing only serves to increase self-love
   and vanity.

   4th. I am charmed that you find peace where you would least expect it;
   it is a sign that God wills you to enjoy peace only in the
   accomplishment of His holy will, which is a very great grace. If I have
   not been able to pity you in your illness it is because I do not look
   upon the sufferings of the body as real evils since they procure so
   many blessings for the soul.

   5th. You are convinced that you do nothing, that you merit nothing; and
   thus you are sunk in your nothingness. Oh! how well off you are!
   because from the moment you are convinced of your own nothingness you
   become united to God Who is all in all. Oh! what a treasure you have
   found in your nothingness! It is a state you must necessarily pass
   through before God can fill your soul; for our souls must be emptied of
   all created things before they can be filled with the Holy Spirit of
   God; so that what troubles you and makes you uneasy is the very thing
   that ought to pacify you and fill you with a holy joy in God.

   6th. Accepting everything without reserve, both present and future, is
   one of the most perfect sacrifices we could offer to God. This habitual
   act alone is worth all else that you could possibly do, therefore your
   best and only practice must be to adhere constantly to all the
   imaginable arrangements of Providence, whether exterior, or interior.
   Do nothing but this, and God will, gradually, operate all the rest in
   your soul. This is a most simple practice, and exactly in accordance
   with your attraction.

   7th. I am not much affected about the reserved manners of your
   companion. You must also make this sacrifice to God. She was not so
   much to blame as you in what put you out so much; God has permitted
   this to humble you by making you understand what you really are when He
   leaves you to your own devices. Humble yourself without vexation or
   worry. You know what St. Francis of Sales says about such
   circumstances.

   8th. God requires of us the fulfilment of our duties, but He does not
   require us to find out if there has been any merit in this or not. You
   think too much about yourself, and under the pious pretext of advancing
   in the ways of God you are too much occupied about yourself. Forget
   yourself to think only of Him and abandon yourself to the commands of
   divine Providence, and then He will Himself lead you on, purify you and
   safely raise you, when and as it pleases Him, to the degree of sanctity
   He wills for you. What have we to do except to please Him, and to
   desire in all things and everywhere what He wills? We search far and
   wide after perfection, and yet it is almost within our grasp. It is to
   unite our will in all things to the will of God and never to follow our
   own inclinations. But to arrive at this we must renounce ourselves and
   sacrifice, if needs be, our dearest interests. This is what we have no
   wish to do; we want God to sanctify and make us perfect according to
   our own ideas and tastes. What folly! What pitiable blindness!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XXIV.--Results of Imprudence.

   To the same Sister. On the vexatious results of imprudence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have already told you very often, my dear Sister, that nothing should
   trouble you, not even your faults, and certainly far less should you
   allow yourself to be cast down by those trying consequences of acts
   which are not sins, although they imply some imprudence on your part.
   There is hardly any trial more mortifying to self-love, and
   consequently hardly any more sanctifying than this. It does not cost
   nearly so much to accept humiliations that come to us from without and
   that we have not had any hand in drawing upon ourselves. One can resign
   oneself much more easily to the confusion caused by faults very much
   graver in themselves provided they do not appear outside. But one
   simple imprudence that entails annoying results that everyone can see;
   this is decidedly of all humiliations the very worst; and therefore, as
   a natural consequence, an excellent occasion for the mortification of
   self-love. Then it is that we can say over and over again the "fiat" of
   perfect abandonment; we must even go further and make an act of
   thanksgiving, adding for this purpose "Gloria Patri" to our "fiat."

   One single trial, accepted thus, causes a soul to make more progress
   than any number of acts of virtue. I hope I have made this clear to you
   and that you will no longer distress yourself about the consequences
   that are likely to follow the mistake of which you have been the
   innocent cause. Remain in peace with the intention of taking what steps
   are necessary at a convenient time to bring about peace, and a union of
   hearts; then abandon to God all the success, whatever it may be. It is
   well to get accustomed to act in this way in all the troublesome events
   of this miserable life; thus we shall enjoy peace, and shall have made
   merit in the sight of divine Providence. Without this submission and
   total abandonment we can expect no rest during the course of our sad
   pilgrimage. Think only of pleasing God, of satisfying God, of
   sacrificing all to God. Let all the rest go, and keep nothing back.
   Provided that God dwells within you, you will never lose anything. Take
   good courage and all will go well; do not be so uneasy, nor so
   surprised at these rebellions of your nature: I assure you that they
   will be no impediment to the submission of your higher faculties, and
   that God only hides this submission for your own good. In the most
   violent attacks try just to say these few words, "It is but just that a
   creature should be submissive to her Creator, therefore I desire and
   pray to become so." Read the chapter on "Progress" in the "Interior
   Life" by Fr. Guilloré; it is an inspired chapter, and I hope you will
   derive great benefit from it.

   For God's sake do not sadden yourself, and try to preserve peace during
   even the most terrible tempests. If you do this all will go well. In
   fact I see nothing but good in everything that you have confided to me,
   but a good that would cease to be so if you saw it as plainly as I do.

   When a number of different thoughts enter my head which makes the least
   thing assume monstrous proportions, I recall to mind the advice I have
   given to others in similar circumstances. I abandon myself to divine
   Providence in all things and about all things. When the worst comes to
   the worst, I defy it like St. Paul, to separate me from the charity of
   Jesus Christ. I know that without the grace of this divine Saviour I
   could do nothing; but I know also that with His grace I can do all
   things; I beg Him therefore to keep me in all my temptations from all
   sin, from all that could displease Him; but as for the bitterness of
   soul, the interior crucifixion, the holy abjection and even the
   confusion before others, I accept them with all their consequences for
   as long as it pleases His sovereign Majesty. I desire the
   accomplishment of His holy will, and not my own in all things, and I
   implore Him not to allow me either to say or to do anything that might
   place any obstacle to the least thing that He wills. And if, through
   weakness, error, or malice I should undertake anything of the kind, I
   implore Him not to allow it to succeed.

   I recognise the fact that His holy will is, in all things, not only
   holy and adorable, but infinitely salutary and beneficent towards those
   who are humbly submissive; and that mine, on the contrary, is always
   either blind or ill-regulated. Therefore I subscribe to all that the
   eternal Father decrees, and would do so a hundred times no matter at
   what cost to myself. This dear and good Father has commanded it, that
   is enough, and what have I to fear? From this, two conclusions can be
   drawn, firstly that during these tempests and storms often raised by
   trifles I retain such a profound peace that I am surprised at it
   myself. Secondly that I consider myself very fortunate to have to
   endure these interior tortures, temptations and trials. Then I say to
   myself, this is worth more than all my own miserable arrangements. I
   feel my soul becoming stronger by this abandonment to divine
   Providence, so much so, that all my personal desires and attachment to
   my own will are consumed and annihilated.

  Letter XXV.--Interior Suffering.

   To Sister Marie-Anne Thérèse de Rosen. Rules to follow during trials.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You know as well as I do, my dear Sister, that in order to raise souls
   to a state of perfection God is wont to make them bear all kinds of
   crosses and interior pains to prove their fidelity, to purify them, and
   to detach them from all created things. The most grievous of these
   crosses are those in which we may have been to blame ourselves, and
   where the poor soul severely reprimanded by others, and even more
   severely by itself, does not hear either outwardly or inwardly anything
   but a sentence of death. The person of whom you speak is in this state,
   therefore there is nothing to fear about her; all that you tell me
   proves on the contrary that God has particular designs with regard to
   her. When you write to her speak of nothing but patience, submission to
   God, and total abandonment to divine Providence, as one does to people
   in the world who are afflicted with temporal necessities. Above all
   make her try, by means of the most filial confidence in God, to repulse
   energetically all trouble and voluntary uneasiness. I repeat,
   voluntarily, because the poor souls to whom God sends this trial cannot
   master the troubles and anxieties by which they are obsessed. This is
   the subject of their greatest pain, and the most afflicting part of
   that state of humiliation in which for a certain time God retains them.
   Therefore they have nothing else to do but to submit to God about these
   paroxysms of interior suffering as well as about all the rest. Say to
   this poor soul that her best prayer will be to remain always in silence
   at the foot of the cross of Jesus Christ, repeating like Him, and with
   Him, "Fiat." "Oh heavenly Father, may Your will, not mine, be done in
   all things. It is You who arrange all our afflictions for the good of
   our souls. You would not act thus unless it were for my greater good
   and eternal salvation. Do with me what You will; I adore and submit." I
   think that your friend does quite right not to examine her thoughts; an
   examination of that kind would only confuse her mind still more. She
   must leave all to God and despise these thoughts and the pretended
   cries of her conscience, and go forward without taking any notice of
   them, directly there is nothing absolutely bad in the act she wishes to
   perform. These vain scruples are a device of the devil to deprive her
   of peace, and thus to prevent her making progress in virtue; for
   trouble is to the soul a most dangerous malady which makes it too
   languid for the practice of virtue, as a sick person who is weak and
   languid is incapable of bodily exertion.

   If she succeeds in preserving peace of mind she will gradually recover,
   just as an infirm and languid person recovers health by taking rest and
   good nourishment. I will give three methods by which to hasten her
   recovery.

   1st. To repulse quietly from her mind all that troubles her and makes
   her anxious, looking upon this sort of thought as coming from the
   devil; because all that comes from God is peaceful and sweet, and helps
   to establish confidence in Him. It is in peace that He dwells and that
   He infuses those different virtues that bring souls to perfection.

   2nd. Frequently to raise the mind and heart to God, with acts of
   submission, abandonment, and confidence in His paternal goodness, which
   only afflicts her at present to sanctify her.

   3rd. To choose for her reading those books most likely to contribute to
   calming her mind and to inspiring her with confidence in God; such as
   "The Treaty," by Mgr. Languet, the book on "Christian Hope," the
   "Letters" of St. Francis of Sales. For the rest let her go on as usual
   without making any change in her conduct, making her confessions and
   communions as she is accustomed to, because the devil, to deceive her,
   and to weaken her still more, will very likely use every artifice to
   inspire her with dislike and an excessive fear of confession, of
   communion, and of all other spiritual exercises. She ought not to lend
   an ear to these evil inspirations but always to follow the light of
   faith and the holy practices of the Christian religion like a true and
   good daughter of holy Church. Amen.

  Letter XXVI.--On Different States of Resignation.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On the same subject. Alby, 1733.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear Sister,

   1st. I cannot do otherwise than congratulate you on the efforts you are
   making to keep always in a state of perfect resignation and of entire
   abandonment to the will of God. In this, for you, consists all
   perfection. But on this point as on all others you must learn how to
   distinguish between the appearance and the reality, the feeling of
   consent and the working of the will. There are two kinds of
   resignation; one that can be felt and that is accompanied by sensible
   pleasure and a quiet repose; the other unfelt, dry, without pleasure,
   even accompanied by feelings of repugnance, and by interior revolt. It
   is this latter that I understand you to possess. The first is good,
   very agreeable to nature, and for this reason rather dangerous, because
   it is natural to become strongly attached to that which one enjoys. The
   second, which to self-love seems absolutely painful and unpleasant, is
   more perfect, more meritorious, and less dangerous since there is no
   pleasure to be found in it except through bare faith and perfect love.
   Compel yourself to act with these solid motives. When you have
   succeeded in doing so your union with God will be proof against every
   vicissitude, but if you accustom yourself only to act according to
   sensible attractions you will do nothing when these come to an end.
   Besides, we cannot prevent them from often failing us, while the
   motives of faith never fail. It is only in order to induce us to act,
   gradually, from these spiritual motives that God so often takes away
   sensible devotion and pleasure. If He were not to act thus we should
   always remain in a state of spiritual infancy. You should not therefore
   be surprised at the weariness and the revolts of which you speak; God
   permits them for your good. Nevertheless, if you fear that human
   motives are mixed with the mortifications you inflict on yourself say
   these two things to yourself (1) "I am not at present in a fit state to
   judge but will reflect about it when I feel peaceful and calm. (2) If
   there is still some human element in it, God allows it that He may help
   my weakness. When it shall have pleased Him to render me less imperfect
   I shall be able to act in a more perfect manner." On this matter be
   calm, and do not indulge in the least voluntary trouble.

   2nd. I can easily understand how your dislike of your duty should
   materially add to your trials; but consider how the martyrs won their
   crowns by enduring much worse tribulations than yours.

   3rd. In this state it is usual to feel an inclination for a solitary
   life, but a life of obedience is of greater value, it is a continual
   sacrifice, and even if there is more cause for being bored, there are
   also many subjects for meriting. Continue as you are with great
   fortitude and even scruple to utter a word against your state, or that
   could detach you from the cross of Jesus Christ.

   4th. The best way of bearing these disagreeables is to look upon them
   as crosses sent by God, just as you do illness and other misfortunes of
   life. If God were to send you exterior afflictions that you could feel,
   you would bear them patiently; bear then with equal patience your
   interior trials.

   5th. Look upon all these miseries of our earthly existence as so much
   treasure for the spiritual life, since they afford you such powerful
   means of acquiring humility and self-contempt. With this aim in view
   love every humiliation, and its consequent abjection, as St. Francis of
   Sales counsels. You ask me if it would not be better to hide your
   miseries for fear of causing disedification. With all my heart. Try
   simply and very quietly to manage so that these feelings may not appear
   externally, but if they should appear and you are not greatly to blame
   for it, try to accept this little humiliation pleasantly. Even should
   it occur by your own fault, then embrace the abjection which it brings
   you. In this way you will mortify your self-love very meritoriously,
   for this seeks to avoid outward faults, not because they are an offence
   against God, but on account of the humiliation they entail. Do not
   dwell on the pain that the difficulty you experience in concentrating
   your thoughts causes you. Remind yourself that the habitual desire of
   recollection alone will serve equally well, and that all that is
   necessary is to desire unceasingly to think of God, to please God, to
   obey God, in order to please and to obey Him in reality.

   6th. You say that the more you desire to learn to pray the less you
   know how to do so. This may very possibly be because your desire is not
   accompanied by a sufficient submission and purity of intention. Always
   have the intention of pleasing God when you pray, and not of enjoying
   sensible devotion. Pray in a spirit of sacrifice and accept all that
   God pleases to send you during your prayer; and I must tell you that
   the prayer of recollection is one of those things, that leaves you if
   you are eager to retain it, and remains if you learn how to keep
   yourself in a state of indifference about it; this is the doctrine of
   St. Francis of Sales.

   7th. Often recall to mind this great rule, that spiritual poverty
   recognised, felt, and loved on account of its abjection, is one of the
   greatest treasures that a soul can possess here below; because this
   feeling keeps it in a state of profound humility; but to imagine
   yourself lost because you do not find in yourself lively enough
   feelings of faith and charity, and to be distressed, uneasy, or
   discouraged about it, is a dangerous illusion of self-love which always
   wants to see things plainly, and to take pleasure in itself. When you
   experience this temptation you must say to yourself, "I have been, I
   am, and I shall be whatever God pleases, but according to my reason and
   the higher faculties of my soul I desire to belong to Him and to serve
   Him no matter what happens to me in this world and the next."

   8th. You cannot describe to me what you are suffering; but I will tell
   you what it is; it is for one thing all kinds of rebellions, pains, and
   temptations in the inferior part of your nature, and a perpetual
   confusion of feelings excited by the devil and your own self-love. On
   the other hand, in the superior part, a little ray of light and of
   faith that is almost imperceptible on account of the tumultous emotions
   in the inferior part. And with only this slender support you are
   immovable, because the finest thread in the hands of God is as strong
   as a cable, and a mere hair is stronger than an iron chain.

   9th. It is a temptation and a false humility to keep away from the
   sacraments. What others do ought never to affect you who know nothing
   about their ideas nor motives, nor the cause of their keeping away.

   10th. You say that God often deprives you of the feeling of being in a
   state of grace. To whom among His dearest friends has He given
   continually this sensible support? Do you aspire by any chance to be so
   highly privileged than so many saints whom He has deprived of it for a
   much longer time than you? What had they to depend upon then save only
   the light of faith, and of a faith the same as ours which seems like
   darkness? And amidst the darkness of their temptations and the tumult
   of their passions they knew no more than we do whether God was
   satisfied with them. Faith teaches us that, unless by particular
   revelation, the saints themselves were not able to be perfectly certain
   about it; and you complain because you do not possess this certainty.
   See how far this unhappy self-love goes. To satisfy it God would have
   to work miracles. Of all the miseries that humble you so much this is
   certainly the greatest, and the best calculated to humiliate you.

   11th. To wish to be occupied with God and not with yourself, and then
   to fall back continually on yourself is, I must own, a temptation as
   troublesome as the flies in autumn; but then you must drive away this
   temptation as you have continually to drive away the flies, without
   ever leaving off this work; quietly however, without distress or
   annoyance, humbling yourself before God as you do in other miseries. It
   is we, ourselves, who compel God to overwhelm us with miseries to make
   us humble and to increase our self-contempt. If, in spite of this, we
   have so little humility and so much self-esteem, what would it be if we
   found ourselves free from these trials? Believe me, you have appeared
   to be for some time past so penetrated with the knowledge of your
   miseries that I believe this feeling alone is one of the greatest
   graces that God could bestow upon you. Love then everything that helps
   to preserve it.

   I remain yours in our Lord.

   I feel very tired of so much writing and before reading to the end of
   your letter I had the same idea as you, to divide my answers. I do not,
   however, regret having now placed you in a condition to understand at a
   single glance the general drift of the direction you ought to follow in
   order to gather all the fruit of the trial to which God is subjecting
   you.

    THE LAST TRIALS. AGONY AND MYSTICAL DEATH. THE FRUIT THEREOF.

  Letter I.--Temptation to Despair.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux. On spiritual
   nakedness. Annihilation. Temptations to despair. Alby, 1732.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear daughter in our Lord. The peace of Jesus Christ be always
   with you.

   Of all your letters the last is the one that has given me most
   consolation before God. You understand nothing about how you are
   circumstanced. I, however, by the grace of God, see it as clearly as
   daylight.

   1st. The state of stupidity and dullness that you depict, the chaotic
   mass of misery and weakness, what else can this be but the gift of God,
   and this is what has gradually produced in your soul different
   spiritual operations of grace. It would be in vain to attempt to
   explain them to you, because God would not enable you to understand
   them in the state to which He has brought you, and the knowledge you
   might gain from reading my letter would vanish at once. But I can, at
   least, give you an assurance which ought to satisfy you.

   I acknowledge that, at first, I was somewhat astonished that God should
   treat you like one advanced in the spiritual life, because this state
   is usually the fruit of long years of combat and effort. The soul finds
   itself entering it when God, satisfied with the diligence with which it
   has laboured to die to all things, sets His own hand to the work to
   make it pass through that death to which the total privation of all
   things created leads. He strips it thus of all pleasure, even to that
   which is spiritual, of all inclination, of all light, to the end that,
   thus, it may become freed from the senses, dull, and as though
   annihilated. When God bestows this grace on a soul, it has hardly
   anything else to do than endure in peace this harsh operation, and to
   bear this gift of God in the profound interior silence of respect,
   adoration and submission. This is your task; in one sense a very easy
   one, since it means nothing more than to act as a sick person confined
   to his bed, and in the hands of his doctor and surgeon. He will suffer
   quite patiently in the expectation of a complete cure. You are in the
   same kind of position, in the hands of the great and charitable
   Physician of our souls, and with a better founded certainty of a cure.

   2nd. The violent and almost continual assault of all your passions is
   the result of the same mortifying and vivifying operation. On the one
   hand, it causes all these movements to give occasion to repel them and
   to acquire the opposite virtues; and, on the other hand, by means of
   these same attacks it lays a solid foundation of perfection which
   comprises the most profound humility, contempt, and hatred of self.

   3rd. Temptations to discouragement and despair are another consequence
   of the same state, and possess still greater power of purifying us. I
   know that there is never any consent because I see that all your
   voluntary intentions are the exact contrary to those of a soul that
   would offend God. No, my dear Sister, you do not offend Him at these
   painful times; your soul, on the contrary, is then like gold that boils
   in the crucible; it is purified, and shines with an added lustre. Never
   are you upheld in a more fatherly way by the hand of God, and if you
   were able to see your state as it really is, far from being afflicted
   about it, you would return thanks to the God of mercy for His ineffable
   gift.

   4th. Your method of prayer is good and will always be so as long as you
   continue it peacefully in an entire abandonment, and, as St. Francis of
   Sales expresses it, in a simple peaceful waiting quite resigned to the
   will of God.

   5th. As each ought to follow his attraction in prayer and at other
   times, do not be afraid to keep yourself always in this great
   destitution which you find within your soul. Remain therein without any
   formed thought, quite dull and insensible to all things. Love this
   state, because with regard to you it is the gift of God, and the
   beginning of all good. I have never come across any chosen souls whom
   God has not made to pass through these dry deserts before arriving at
   the promised land which is the terrestrial paradise of perfection.

   6th. Interior reproaches about the slightest faults are an evident sign
   of the especial care taken by the Holy Spirit for your advancement.
   With certain souls He allows nothing to escape notice, and about them
   He has a most fastidious jealousy; and it is a sure truth that souls
   which are the objects of this jealousy, cannot, without infidelity,
   allow themselves to do what other persons can do without imperfection.
   The fastidiousness and jealousy of divine love are more or less great
   according to the degree of its predilection. Consider if you have any
   occasion to pity yourself about the merciful rigour it uses towards
   you.

   7th. You are right to have no particular desire to make a Retreat; you
   are no longer in a position to desire, but rather in that of having to
   abandon yourself unreservedly to all that the Holy Spirit wishes to
   effect in you. It is for Him to determine the time, the duration, the
   manner, and the results of His operations, and for you to endure with
   submission, love and gratitude. Some of these results are extremely
   severe; but the most humiliating, the most bitter, are always the most
   sanctifying. Keep yourself, therefore, very quiet, and allow this good
   physician who has undertaken your cure to act as seems best to Him.

   8th. You can apply to yourself all that I wrote last year to Sister
   Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet, and derive profit for your own needs; but
   you must not be surprised that while you are suffering from this
   spiritual upsetting neither my letters nor any books will be of any
   use. God wills it otherwise; at present He extinguishes all light, all
   feeling, to operate alone in the depths of your soul whatever He
   pleases. Now I ask you, is not what God does of infinitely more value
   than all you could effect by your own industry? Beg Him to treat you
   like a beast of burden that allows itself to be led without resistance;
   or like a stone which receives the blows of the hammer, and takes what
   form the architect desires.

   9th. The loss of hope causes you more grief than any other trial. I can
   well understand this, for, as during your life you find yourself
   deprived of everything that could give you the least help, so you
   imagine that at the hour of your death you will be in a state of
   fearful destitution. Ah! this is indeed a misery, and for this I pity
   you far more than for your other sufferings. Allow me, with the help of
   God's grace, to endeavour to set this trouble in its true light and so
   to cure you. What you want, my dear Sister, is to find support and
   comfort in yourself and your good works. Well, this is precisely what
   God does not wish, and what He cannot endure in souls aspiring after
   perfection. What! lean upon yourself? count on your works? Could
   self-love, pride, and perversity have a more miserable fruit? It is to
   deliver them from this that God makes all chosen souls pass through a
   fearful time of poverty, misery and nothingness. He desires to destroy
   in them gradually all the help and confidence they derive from
   themselves, to take away every expedient so that He may be their sole
   support, their confidence, their hope, their only resource. Oh! what an
   accursed hope it is, that without reflexion you seek in yourself. How
   pleased I am that God destroys, confounds and annihilates this accursed
   hope by means of this state of poverty and misery. Oh! happy poverty!
   blessed despoilment! which formed the delight of all the saints and
   especially of St. Francis of Sales! Let us love it as they loved it,
   and when by virtue of this love all confidence and hope, all earthly
   and created support has been removed, we shall find neither hope nor
   support in anything but God, and this is the holy hope and confidence
   of the saints which is founded solely on the mercy of God and the
   merits of Jesus Christ. But you will only attain to this hope when God
   shall have completely destroyed your self-confidence, root and branch;
   and this cannot be effected without retaining you for some time in the
   utmost spiritual poverty.

   10th. "But," you will argue, "of what use are our good works if they
   may not be for us some ground for confidence?" They are useful in
   attaining for us the grace of a complete distrust of ourselves and of a
   greater confidence in God. This is all the use that the saints made of
   them. What, in fact, are our good works? They are frequently so spoilt
   and corrupted by our self-love that if God judged us rigorously we
   should deserve chastisements for them rather than rewards. Think no
   more, then, of your good works as of something to tranquillize you at
   the hour of death, do not reflect on anything but the mercy of God, the
   merits of Jesus Christ, the intercession of the saints, and the prayers
   of holy souls, but on nothing, absolutely nothing that might give
   occasion to reliance on yourself, nor to placing the least degree of
   confidence in your works.

   11th. That which you say to others, or rather what God gives you to say
   for their consolation while you yourself are in a state of extreme
   dryness, does not, in the least, surprise me. God acts thus, often
   enough, when He wishes to console others, and at the same time to keep
   oneself in a state of desolation and abandonment. You then say what God
   inspires you to say without any feeling yourself, but with much
   sympathy for others; I do not see any sign of hypocrisy in this.

   12th. To avoid relaxation during the fulfilment of the duties you have
   undertaken through obedience, it is only necessary to do everything
   quietly, without either anxiety or eagerness, and to do them in this
   way you have but to do them for the love of God and to obey Him, as St.
   Francis advises. "Therefore," continues the same saint, "as this love
   is gentle and sweet, all that it inspires shares the same spirit." But
   when self-love interferes with the wish to succeed and to be satisfied,
   which always accompanies it, it first introduces natural activities and
   excitements and their anxieties and troubles. "Whatever these duties
   are," you tell me, "I feel sure that they prevent me making any
   progress." My dear Sister, when one loves God, one does not wish to
   make greater progress than God wills, and one abandons one's spiritual
   progress to divine Providence, just as wealthy people in the world
   abandon to Him all the success of their temporal affairs. But the great
   misfortune is that self-love thrusts itself everywhere, meddles with
   everything and spoils all. It is because of this that even our desire
   of advancing is food for self-love, a source of trouble, and
   consequently an obstacle to our prayers.

   13th. Another foolish terror! "You fear," you say, "that your want of
   feeling is the principle of your peace." Yes, certainly this is true,
   and it is for this reason that I look upon it as a gift of God. I hope
   that the operations of the Holy Spirit will lead to a still greater
   insensibility so as to render you with regard to all created things
   like a block of wood, or the trunk of a tree. This is what I have
   already told you, and you ridiculed the idea. We are getting to it, by
   degrees, God be praised! Without this kind of insensibility we should
   have neither the strength, nor the courage necessary in many
   circumstances to keep peaceful. We should require the virtue of blessed
   Margaret Mary Alacoque of whom it was related with admiration that in
   the midst of all her tenderness she was always mistress of herself. As
   for your taste for solitude among all your occupations, I will say to
   you what St. Ignatius said to Fr. Laynez in similar circumstances:
   "Father, if at court where obedience retains you, you feel this great
   desire for solitude, it shows that you are in safety; if this desire
   should vanish and you should come even to love your distracting duties
   it would be a bad sign." Preserve, therefore, this love and desire of
   solitude, but as long as God keeps you in the midst of the cares and
   distractions of your occupations, try to love them for the sake of
   obedience.

  Letter II.--Good Symptoms.

   To the same Sister. Alby, 1732.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister and very dear daughter in our Lord.

   The peace of Jesus Christ be always with you. Your letter reminded me
   of a saying of Fénélon: "One does not begin to know and to feel one's
   spiritual miseries until they begin to be cured." It is, therefore, a
   very good symptom to feel overwhelmed with miseries, provided that this
   feeling be exempt from voluntary uneasiness, and joined to a complete
   interior resignation.

   1st. During this state of obscurity, dryness, coldness, and spiritual
   destitution, retain in your soul a firm and sincere will to be all for
   God; this is all that you can do under such circumstances. Then be
   comforted and remain in peace in the higher part of your soul.

   2nd. It is true that this state of which I spoke to you in my last
   letter is a great gift of God, and that usually it is kept for chosen
   souls who have been tried for a long time in the inferior degrees of
   the spiritual life; but it is also occasionally accorded, out of pure
   goodness, to imperfect souls, because God is in no way subject to laws.
   He bestows such graces as He pleases and to whomsoever He pleases. This
   is your case I can assure you. You only have, therefore, on your side,
   to keep yourself continually submissive to the interior dispositions
   that you experience at each moment, only willing what God wills, and
   for as long as He wills it. If you are faithful in bearing this trial
   to the end, you will see in time what will be the result. I rejoice
   beforehand at the good fruit of which I guarantee you before God.

   You are suffering and without merit, without real fidelity. You believe
   this and it is good for you to think so since God permits it. Remain as
   long as you like in this belief, but let it be subject to the will of
   God, and I will answer for you.

   3rd. You can see nothing in your present state and still less since you
   received my last letter than you did before. All the better! I hope
   that your darkness will increase day by day, for, by the grace of God I
   see clearly through this darkness, and that ought to be enough for you.
   Go on therefore through this dark night by the light of blind
   obedience. This is a safe guide which has never led anyone astray and
   which conducts with more certainty and more quickly than even acts of
   the most perfect abandonment.

   4th. These acts, however, are excellent, but it may sometimes happen
   that you find it impossible to make them, and then you will be able to
   put yourself into a still more perfect condition, which consists in
   keeping an interior silence of respect, adoration and submission, about
   which I have so often spoken. This silence says more to God than all
   your formal acts, and that without reverting to self-complacency
   without sensible consolation. This is the true mystical death which
   ought necessarily to precede the supernatural life of grace. You would
   never arrive at that entirely spiritual and interior life to which you
   aspire with so much ardour, if God did not find in you this second
   death; death to spiritual consolations. These consolations are, in
   fact, so delightful, that if God did not detach us from them by severe
   trials we should become more attached to them than to any worldly
   pleasures, and that would be an insurmountable obstacle to perfect
   union.

   5th. In this state God knows about what you are occupied, and I know
   also; let that be sufficient for you. It is good for you to believe
   yourself reduced to complete destitution. Apparently you will never
   arrive at the happy state of one servant of God who could no longer
   hold any intercourse with men as he had forgotten the common language.
   Learn for your support in this trial that what forms your great pain
   and martyrdom to-day will one day become your greatest delight. When
   will this happy time arrive? Only God knows! it will be when He
   pleases.

   6th. The slight distraction and diminution of peace that you
   experienced directly you left this state of stupidity for a short time
   ought to have shown you what occupied you without your knowledge in
   your apparent want of occupation, and what it is that fills this
   fearful void.

   7th. Do not expect to be able to explain this matter to yourself more
   clearly. With God's grace I see it as plainly as mid-day. You,
   yourself, feel at certain moments the fortunate effects of this kind of
   stupidity. No! No! it is neither melancholia, nor eccentricity, it is
   the operation of the Holy Spirit.

   8th. There are times when everything irritates and wearies you; so they
   should. Saint Teresa even said that at these times she did not feel
   that she had strength enough to crush an ant for the love of God. Never
   could anyone attain to an entire distrust of self and to a perfect
   confidence in God unless he had passed through these different states
   of complete insensibility, and absolute powerlessness. Happy state
   which produces such marvellous effects.

   9th. That which you experienced in Retreat was a slight increase of
   your ordinary state, resembling the paroxysms of a fever. This increase
   of trouble cannot but have been very salutary for you from the moment
   you accepted it, as you say you did. Keep quiet; God leads you, His
   grace works in you, although in a severe and crucifying manner, as is
   experienced in all violent remedies. Your spiritual maladies had need
   of remedies such as these; let your good Physician act as He best knows
   how; He will proportion the strength of the remedy to the power of the
   malady. Oh! how ill you were formerly without being aware of it! It was
   then that you ought to have taken the alarm, and not now that your
   convalescence is secured.

   10th. What you experience at prayer is a very good thing although very
   bitter. Do nothing more, however, than keep firmly an entire
   resignation in the higher faculties of your soul, as St. Francis of
   Sales advises.

   11th. In the way you made your retreat formerly there was infinitely
   more sensible devotion, and consequently, more satisfaction for
   self-love; but your present want of feeling is of incomparably more
   value, and you will have felt this already by its effects; for you are
   very different now to what you used to be after those delightful
   retreats. If you do not recognise this fact I do so instead of you. If
   you were able to reflect a little you would, yourself, notice how
   little foundation there is for your fears. How can you explain without
   a particular operation of grace, that although you passed the whole
   time of retreat so sadly, yet, nevertheless, the time passed very
   rapidly and without weariness? Ought you not to find in this a manifest
   proof that you were very well occupied, while it lasted, without
   knowing it?

   12th. The terror caused by your past sins is the most hurtful and
   dangerous of your temptations, therefore I command you to dismiss all
   these diabolical artifices, in the same way as you would drive away
   temptations to blasphemy, or impurity. Think only of the present time
   in order to conform your thoughts to the holy will of God alone. Leave
   all the rest to His providence and mercy. No! your stupidity and want
   of feeling are, by no means, a punishment for some hidden sin, as the
   devil would like to make you imagine, to disturb the peace of your
   soul. They are real graces; bitter, it is true, but which have had and
   will continue to have very good effects. Who tells you this? It is I
   who assure you of it by the authority of God.

   13th. I should have been very sorry to have had the foolish
   satisfaction of hearing your general confession; it would have been to
   allow you to be caught in the devil's trap. What ought you to do then
   to free yourself from these fears? To obey simply and blindly him who
   speaks to you on the part of God who sent him; and think no more,
   voluntarily, about it.

   14th. Your callousness and indifference towards everything that
   hitherto gave you the greatest pleasure, is, in truth, one of the
   greatest graces that God could bestow upon you. But how can this be? By
   this frightful void, by this lasting state of stupidity and callousness
   which seems so bitter to you. Yes, indeed, this remedy is painful, but
   what fortunate effects are produced by it when you accept it lovingly
   from the hand of the kind Physician of your soul. Here in a few words
   is an abridgment of the whole of this letter. Your only spiritual
   practice will be to continue, as now, in the hands of God like a rough
   stone to be shaped, cut, and polished, with heavy blows of the hammer
   and chisel, waiting patiently until the sovereign Architect arranges in
   what part of the building you are to be placed after you have been cut
   and shaped by His hand.

   Yours always in the Lord.

   P.S.--That which you relate to me about the Duke of Hamilton is really
   wonderful, but does not surprise me at all. We are accustomed to see
   similar effects of the power and mercy of God. That little conversation
   was a grace for you. Never forget it.

  Letter III.--Interior Oppression.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   For the crushing and overwhelming weight which remains ever on your
   spirit, I have but one remedy; a simple acquiescence, a humble "fiat,"
   which you will perhaps say without feeling it, but which God will hear
   distinctly, and which will be sufficient to sanctify you and to make of
   you a martyr of Providence. Besides this, you would never be able to
   believe how many excellent acts are comprised in the feeling of
   oppression that this heaviness of heart occasions. It is a much greater
   grace for you than you can imagine. You will find it a most efficacious
   means of acquiring a true spirit of penance; that compunction so much
   valued by all the saints, and of which God has frequently made you feel
   the need. Take up your cross, then, and with submission and gratitude,
   repeat often to God that even in your most holy desires, and those that
   are most salutary, you wish to take His adorable will for rule and
   measure, desiring only that degree of virtue and eternal happiness
   which He intends you to have. Communicate as frequently as you are
   permitted, and endure with peace and submission all the trials that the
   reception of this Sacrament will occasion you. Your humility and
   interior abasement will supply for all the dispositions that you lack;
   and the privation of all sensible fruit will be amply compensated for
   by the courage and abandonment with which you bear yourself in the ways
   by which God leads you. Your illness and the rule of life it compels
   you to follow are the best penance you could have. You are afraid of
   pleasing yourself in this state of suffering by not fasting? Foolish
   fear! rather be afraid of being wanting in interior abnegation while
   following your own ideas. Obey your doctor blindly: God requires this
   of you, whereas He certainly does not ask you to fast. Offer Him, as
   often as you are able, your illness, its consequences, and your fears;
   but only in your heart, quietly; recollecting that you must will all
   that God wills. Just a thought of, a look at our Lord will be enough.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter IV.--Purification of the Heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   From the bottom of my heart I bless God, my dear Sister, for carrying
   on His work in you. The crushing weight that you feel on your heart is
   one of the most salutary operations of that crucifying love which does
   in your heart what fire does to green wood. Before the flame can make
   its way the wood crackles, smokes, and gives out all the damp with
   which it is saturated; but when it is perfectly dry it burns quietly,
   diffusing all round it a brilliant light. This will be the case with
   you after your heart has been purified by many crosses, and
   particularly by these crucifying spiritual operations. You must
   therefore endure these operations with courage, with sweetness,
   avoiding as much as possible worrying, or distressing yourself
   interiorly. This is the good and sufficient penance that God requires
   of you. It is of more value than any corporal austerities, although
   everyone ought to practice the latter according to his strength and
   health. In what you add I see an evident sign of the good effect
   produced by your present trial. It seems to you, you say, that you are
   always waiting for something that is wanting to you. This is because
   your heart, tired of creatures; and unable to exist without joy and
   love, feels more keenly than ever a longing for that sovereign good
   which can alone satisfy it. The greater the void left in the heart by
   its withdrawal from all earthly affections, the greater is the ardour
   with which it sighs after the enjoyment of God, and of His holy love.
   This it is for which you are waiting; and it is precisely by this
   waiting and these secret sighs that at last you will obtain this divine
   love. The waters of life are given to those who thirst for them. Ardent
   desires are the money with which to buy this sublime and exquisite
   enjoyment of God; that heavenly food which alone can appease the hunger
   and thirst of the soul; whereas the love for, and even the possession
   of all created goods does nothing but inflame and irritate, without
   ever satisfying them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter V.--On Emptiness of Heart.

   On Emptiness of heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I greatly approve, my dear Sister, of the patience with which you
   endure the great emptiness you experience in your soul. By this you
   will make more progress in one month than you would in several years of
   sweetness and consolation. About this I can only exhort you to go on in
   the same way. It is necessary to traverse this desert to reach during
   this life the promised land. I am not at all surprised that this great
   emptiness seems like a support to you. This is what, in fact, it is,
   because God is present therein, but in an almost imperceptible manner,
   just as He was in your trials. Look upon this distaste for all things,
   and apparent want of feeling towards all that is not God, as a great
   grace to be carefully guarded and preserved. God will come at the time
   fixed by His grace to fill the void which He has made in your heart,
   and the ineffable sweetness of His presence will create a fresh
   distaste for the miserable pleasures of this world. From this time,
   therefore, bid a general and final farewell to all creatures; and
   rejoice when they forsake you of their own accord; God permits this as
   a help to your weakness. As for me, I am delighted at what has
   happened, and that you have been treated with so little consideration.
   This conduct has certainly been as salutary for you as it was
   humiliating. Oh! if you could gradually become accustomed to love this
   abjection what progress would you not make!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VI.--Fresh Suffering.

   To Sister Marie-Thérèse de Vioménil. On the same subject and the
   renewal of pain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   Since you find my letters consoling and useful, I promise you that,
   wherever I may be, to the last moment of my life, I will continue to
   reply to yours faithfully.

   1st. The imperfections and even the faults we may commit contrary to
   entire submission to the will of God, do not prevent that submission
   from dwelling in the heart, and do not destroy the merit of it. To make
   up for the harm these faults occasion us, it is sufficient to humble
   ourselves about them, and to return as quickly as possible to a filial
   abandonment into the hands of God.

   2nd. I understand better than you imagine your anguish of heart and the
   weight that seems to crush it. For several years I was in the same
   state and about something, in itself very insignificant, that hurt my
   pride. I committed many faults, but I tried at once to recover the
   ground I had lost. Some time elapsed before I recognised the advantages
   I had derived from this trial. They appeared, eventually, so great and
   so numerous that I continue to thank God daily for having thus struck
   me in His mercy by making me pass through this spiritual cleansing. I
   feel convinced that in due time God will grant you very nearly the same
   ideas, and that then you will never tire of returning thanks to Him for
   that which so much afflicts you at present. I have also had similar
   experiences on innumerable occasions of the increase of trouble about
   which you speak; exactly like the paroxysms of a fever.

   3rd. At such times, as in severe illness, you can only try to remain as
   much as possible in silence and peace; because, as regards express
   acts, and especially such as are sensible and consoling, one is not
   then in a fit state to make them. However, God sees the submission that
   has its foundation in the heart, and that is enough for gaining merit.
   In this state the less the consolation you enjoy so much the more the
   spiritual profit you will derive from it.

   4th. It is not forbidden to ask God to take away these troubles,
   especially if they violently afflict the heart. Jesus Christ acted thus
   in the Garden of Olives; but you must add as He did and in union with
   Him, "Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done," and although you may
   feel very great repugnance to adding these words and do so with much
   interior rebellion, it does not matter. It is the lower nature that
   resists and is afflicted. This resistance does not, however, destroy
   the resignation of the superior part; on the contrary, it does but
   increase the merit and hasten the progress of the soul in the paths of
   solid virtue.

   5th. They are doing quite right in making you frequent the sacraments;
   you would commit a serious fault if you were to stay away, and nothing
   could be more dangerous for you. Neither depression, nor
   discouragement, nor trouble, nor confusion, nor any interior difficulty
   should ever prevent you going to Holy Communion. Such painful
   conditions, endured and accepted for God, are worth more than fervour
   and sensible consolation. The latter often only serve to feed and
   encourage spiritual self-love, the most subtle and evasive of all the
   forms of self-love, while the other dispositions tend to its gradual
   extinction. It is in this destruction of self-love that all true piety
   and all spiritual progress consist, while for want of real abnegation
   most devout people have only the appearance of piety. In the unsettled
   state of your health you should find only another subject for daily
   sacrifice that is very meritorious. You must submit to all the remedies
   and even resign yourself to give up fasting, even for a single day.
   Your worries and scruples about this matter have no foundation. You
   must make a sacrifice, for the sake of obedience, of these troubles and
   disinclinations however spiritual they seem to be. If you do otherwise
   it will be a real illusion which your own good sense should lead you to
   avoid, but to which I have seen many people, even Religious, give in.

  Letter VII.--Supernatural Fears.

   To Sister de Lesen of the Annunciation. Supernatural fears and pain.
   (1736)
     __________________________________________________________________

   In spite of the great natural compassion, and the great affection in
   our Lord that I feel towards the afflicted person of whom you speak, I
   cannot feel either alarmed at her state, or even pity her very much
   about it. I have frequently told her that, after the signal favours she
   has received from God, I was astonished at one thing only, which was,
   that having received a high degree of the gift of simple recollection
   she has not been sooner submitted to the usual trials of that state. It
   will suffice to inform you that when I became aware of the beginning of
   this trial I could feel neither surprise nor annoyance. Now that I
   perceive a fresh access of suffering I can but repeat what she already
   knows, and what God has given her grace to put in practice, in fact,
   what you yourself have told her. This you know as well as I do. As long
   as God keeps her in this suffering state an angel from Heaven could not
   draw her out of it, nor impart to her the slightest consolation.
   Nevertheless I will, for your satisfaction, willingly explain a few
   little details.

   1st. That which enables me to judge that the state of this dear soul
   is, at one and the same time, a trial and an effect of her progress in
   the supernatural life is, first, that this sad condition is the outcome
   of a sense of faith, of a lively fear of the judgments of God, of
   death, of eternity, etc. Secondly, that she has been much consoled for
   a long time by abandoning herself into the hands of God, and uniting
   herself to Jesus crucified. Thirdly, that this painful access of
   suffering has come upon her now without any sensible or apparent cause,
   and without being preceded by any reflexion. Fourthly, even if her
   natural temperament, character, disposition, and other causes have
   contributed to produce it, as sometimes happens, the pain, in the end,
   is none the less supernatural; because it is beyond nature to produce
   such an effect without sensible or apparent cause. Therefore have no
   fears on her account for she is certainly in the state that mystical
   authors call "suffering the crucifying gift of God." As for the fear
   she has of losing her reason, she is not the only one who has been
   tormented by such fears. I have known numbers of people who have been
   impelled to make this great and last sacrifice with an entire
   abandonment, and full confidence. She will have the whole merit of it
   without its realisation, I hope, being required of her by God. These
   are the ways of God with souls. He only asks in innumerable similar
   cases, the sacrifice of the heart without its completion, as He acted
   formerly with regard to Abraham. Therefore let her hope against all
   hope. Every trial, borne well, will turn out for her very advantageous;
   be consoled and in peace about her. As for the Retreat, I am inclined
   to think it would be well to defer it. But if, however, she wishes to
   continue it she has only to do what you have advised her; her only
   meditation to be on confidence in God; her only reading such as will
   nourish her soul with the essence of pure recollection, almost without
   thought or reasoning, at any rate none that requires effort.

   2nd. She should reflect as little as possible about her suffering and
   interior distress. Such reflections while detracting from the merit
   only tend to embitter and increase the evil. Let her try to forget
   herself and to think only of God, but gently and simply without any
   violent effort. She should not speak of her afflictions any more, not
   even to God in prayer. Let her intercourse with Him be on quite
   different subjects as much as possible.

   3rd. If solitude has the effect of plunging her more deeply into
   anguish in spite of herself, then I advise her to converse about holy
   things with you, or any of the other Sisters. The Rev. Mother is right
   to cut off the annual confession. I forbid it on the part of God, and
   prohibit the mere thought of it.

   4th. As you, very rightly, remark, it is certain that this state of
   suffering has already produced very good results in this soul. Nothing
   ever has, nor ever could do her so much good. Even when the extreme
   pain should have altogether ceased, I foretell that there will remain
   for a long time a certain impression of interior humiliation which will
   continue to produce marvellous after-effects. The fear that this
   miserable state will return will make her depend on God with a profound
   and continual confidence, which will prove for her a very great
   blessing.

   5th. For the rest, if these supernatural troubles find no human remedy,
   nothing is more easy than to point out a way to derive great profit
   from them, and to soften them considerably. Submission, abandonment,
   peace, patience, confidence in God, and to allow God to act without
   interruption by too frequent interior acts; in a word, there should
   only be a humble and simple interior disposition produced in the soul
   by the grace of Jesus Christ, with which it co-operates somehow, but
   more passively than actively, or to speak correctly, by making its
   activity submissive to the action of God. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter VIII.--Violent Temptations.

   To Sister de Lesen. (1736)
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. My dear Sister. Each ought to make her prayer, her spiritual
   exercises, and consequently, her Retreat, according to her attraction,
   and her needs. Take therefore a spiritual book which suits the
   attraction which grace gives you at the moment; and in all your
   interior occupations let your soul tend above all to a total
   abandonment to God. Rest an unlimited confidence in the divine mercy,
   and be strengthened in this feeling with the more energy the more
   subjects for fear you believe yourself to have. What most delights the
   heart of God is that you should hope against all hope; that is to say,
   against the apparent impossibility of seeing what you hope for
   realised.

   2nd. As to the horrible temptation you have spoken about in your letter
   to me, I declare that it would be difficult to imagine any more
   fearful, whether in itself, or in its circumstances. Be very careful
   not to allow yourself to be overcome by it. To begin with you must know
   that these trials, which are more grievous than any others, are those
   which God usually makes those souls whom He most loves undergo. At this
   time I have under my direction some who, in this respect, are in an
   indescribable state, the mere account of which would horrify you. The
   entire interior nature is encompassed with darkness, and buried in mud.
   God retains and upholds the free will, that higher faculty of the soul,
   without affording it the slightest feeling of support. He enlightens it
   with the entirely spiritual light of pure faith in which the senses
   have no part; and the poor soul, abandoned, as it appears, to its
   misery, delivered over as a prey to the malice of devils, is reduced to
   a most frightful desolation, and endures a real martyrdom. On this
   subject read that Chapter in Guilloré where he speaks of very great
   temptations. It is true that we should always fear, but without being
   anxious or depressed, and always with a tendency to confidence. Never
   forget that the Almighty who has His plans in these hidden matters,
   takes possession in the depths of the soul, and sustains it divinely,
   without allowing it any perception of His presence. In this state God
   bestows on you a grace that He often refuses to many others; that of
   feeling, or at least of knowing and discerning, that you would prefer
   to be torn in pieces rather than give the least consent.

   3rd. Do not be embarrassed as to the way you ought to confess the
   thoughts and suggestions of the enemy. You must never mention them at
   all. As to the manner of resisting them, the best, the easiest, and the
   most efficacious for persons following your way, is that which you have
   adopted already; I mean a simple look of the soul at its God; an
   interior movement by which without agitation or anxiety, it turns away
   from creatures and from itself to turn to its Creator. It is a true
   conversion of the soul to God. Make use of it always and for
   everything, whenever in His goodness He gives you this grace. However,
   you can occasionally form a deliberate act of resistance, but without
   feeling yourself obliged to do so, and without violent effort. "My God
   preserve me from all voluntary consent; may I rather die than consent
   freely to offend You in any way whatever. Yes, death rather than sin,
   Oh my God! But as for the pain, anguish of heart, spiritual desolation,
   humiliation, and abjection, I accept them for as long a time as You
   please."

   4th. The terrifying idea of the justice of God, the anguish and
   interior bitterness which ensue are evidently another trial sent you by
   God. It is not less evident that the peace and tranquillity which
   accompany these dreadful feelings arise from the submission that God
   establishes in the depths of your soul. This peace, with the interior
   conviction that everything you do is useless for gaining Heaven, is not
   so difficult to understand as you imagine; not, at any rate, to
   directors who have had some experience. The peace comes from God, it
   dwells in the recesses of the soul, or according to St. Francis of
   Sales in the highest point of the mind. This alarming conviction is
   nothing else than a vivid impression which the devil is allowed to
   produce in the lower nature, or, as it were, in the exterior and
   sensitive part of your soul. It is this diabolical impression which
   makes a martyr of your soul, and it is the submission which God gives
   it that produces the peace which is above all feeling. This is certain,
   I assure you. If you could see it as plainly as I do it would no longer
   be a trial to you. Be satisfied therefore with the almost imperceptible
   sight of it which God allows you, and with what I must call some sort
   of confused feeling which keeps you in peace. For the rest, even if
   this feeling is lacking obedience ought to suffice you; obedience and
   abandonment. Repeat without ceasing by a firm, actual disposition of
   your will: "May God do with me whatever He pleases, but, meanwhile, I
   wish to love and to serve Him to the best of my power, and to hope in
   Him. I should continue to hope in Him even if I found myself at the
   gates of hell." It is of faith that God never abandons anyone who gives
   himself to Him, and who places all his confidence in Him. Say then, "He
   is the God of my salvation, never could my salvation be more assured
   than when placed in His hands, and when confided entirely to His
   infinite goodness. If left to myself I could do nothing but spoil
   everything and lose my soul."

   5th. The torment of the lower nature during these attacks would not be
   able to destroy your peace of mind if your submission to God were
   perfect. This is called having a solid and not an imaginary peace. With
   regard to troublesome thoughts, foolish imaginations, and other
   temptations you must first, as soon as possible, let them fall like a
   stone in the water. Secondly, if you cannot succeed in doing this, as
   frequently happens in times of trial, you must allow yourself to suffer
   as God pleases the maladies of the soul, just as you would those of the
   body; in patience, peace, submission, confidence, and a total
   abandonment, willing only to do the will of God in union with Jesus
   Christ.

   6th. Your "fiat," with regard to things of which you disapprove, taking
   care not to show what you feel, out of charity, is all that God asks of
   you. Oh! my dear Sister, how happy would be many souls that I know, if
   God were to give them all the consoling advantages He bestows upon you.

   7th. A profound desire for recollection is a very real recollection in
   itself, although unaccompanied by pleasure. If less consoling than
   sensible recollection, it is all the more disinterested, and
   consequently more meritorious. In such a state one appropriates nothing
   to oneself because one seems to possess nothing at all.

   8th. The impatience caused by the feeling of your own nothingness, is
   only a slight vexation of pride and self-love, and would be a serious
   imperfection if consented to, because we ought to deplore our misery
   with a tranquil humility. "Learn," says St. Francis of Sales, "to bear
   your own miseries as you ought to bear those of your neighbour."

   9th. I am not surprised at the increase of your trials and temptations
   since your Retreat. If you understood, as I do, the good effects they
   ought to produce in purifying the most secret recesses of your heart,
   you would bless God for them without ceasing; for this is a great
   grace, and one that God reserves for those souls whom He wishes to lead
   to pure love, by detachment from all created things, and especially
   from themselves.

   10th. It is a good thing to do some exterior penance, provided it be
   done with discretion, but you must not do too much. As long as your
   present trial lasts you should first of all make your renunciation
   consist in accepting it with perfect submission. You still have a great
   deal to do to reach this perfect abandonment, and I should be sorry if
   you were to lose sight of this kind of mortification to practice others
   much less necessary. Your spiritual troubles will only subside when you
   abandon yourself to all that God wills for you without reserve, without
   limit, and for ever. God be praised for all and in all. Amen.

  Letter IX.--Death of Self-Love.

   To Sister Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Rosen. Annihilation and spiritual
   agony.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   1st. Such a lively impression of your nothingness in the sight of God
   is one of the most salutary operations of the grace of the Holy Spirit.
   I know how much suffering this operation entails. The poor soul feels
   as if it would become utterly annihilated, but for all that, it is only
   nearer the true life. In fact the more we realise our nothingness the
   nearer we are to truth, since we were made from nothing, and drawn out
   of it by the pure goodness of our Lord. We ought therefore to remember
   this continually, in order to render by our voluntary annihilation a
   continual homage to the greatness and infinity of our Creator. Nothing
   is more pleasing to God than this homage, nothing could make us more
   certain of His friendship, while at the same time nothing so much
   wounds our self-love. It is a holocaust in which it is completely
   consumed by the fire of divine love. You must not then be surprised at
   the violent resistance it offers, especially when the soul experiences
   mortal anguish in receiving the death-blow to this self-love. The
   suffering one feels then is like that of a person in agony, and it is
   only through this painful agony and by the spiritual death which
   follows it that one can arrive at the fulness of divine life and an
   intimate union with God. What else can be done when this painful but
   blessed hour arrives, but imitate Jesus Christ on the Cross; commend
   one's soul to God, abandoning oneself more and more utterly to all that
   this sovereign Master pleases to do to His poor creature, and to endure
   this agony for as long as He pleases.

   2nd. For the time that these crucifying operations continue, the
   understanding, the memory and the will are in a fearful void, in
   nothingness. Love this immense void since God deigns to fill it; love
   this nothingness since the infinitude of God is there. Take good
   courage, my dear daughter, and agree to everything with that holy
   abasement of spirit of Jesus crucified. It is from Him that we should
   look for all our strength. When these agonies begin, accustom yourself
   to repeat, "Yes, Lord, I desire to do Your holy will in all things, in
   union with Jesus Christ." What is there to fear in such company? In the
   midst of the strongest temptations, cast yourself simply at the feet of
   your Saviour-God, and your troubles will cease; He will render you
   victorious, and aided by His strength your weakness will triumph over
   all the artifices of the tempter.

   3rd. The revolt of the passions without any occasion being given them
   by you, the interior excitement and involuntary trouble this and a
   hundred other miseries cause in you, are permitted for two reasons.
   First, to humble you in an extraordinary degree, to make you realise
   what a heap of misery, what an abyss of corruption is yours, in
   allowing you to see what would become of you without the great mercy of
   God. Secondly, in order that by the interior supervention of fresh
   operations all these germs of death, hitherto hidden in your own soul,
   can be uprooted like noxious weeds, which only appear above ground that
   they may be more easily taken up by the skilled hand of the gardener.
   It is only after having completely cleared the ground that he can
   cultivate wholesome plants, sweet smelling flowers, and choice fruits.
   Let Him do this, give up to Him entirely the task of cultivating this
   rough ground, which left to itself could bring forth nothing but
   thistles and thorns. Do not be anxious. Be content to feel yourself
   greatly humbled and much confounded, remain profoundly abased in this
   heap of mire, like Job on his dung-hill; it is your right place; wait
   for God to draw you out of it, and meanwhile allow yourself to be
   purified by Him. What does it signify so long as you are pleasing to
   Him? Sometimes princes take pleasure in splashing their favourites with
   water, then the favourite is happy to be thus treated since it gives
   his prince pleasure.

   4th. When you feel pusillanimous and filled with fears, humble
   yourself, and say to yourself, "My weakness is so extreme that left to
   myself I could do nothing, but with the grace of Jesus Christ
   everything becomes possible and easy. In him alone will I hope, He will
   give me all that is good for me."

   5th. But what is most trying, but most in conformity with the rules by
   which privileged souls are guided, is the piercing thought that God
   rejects you, that He abandons you as for ever unworthy of His favours.
   Oh! my dear Sister, you would be only too happy now if you could
   understand as I do what is even in this, the kind conduct of God in
   your regard. All that I can say to you about it, and I say it without
   knowing whether in your state of trial, it will please God to make you
   understand it, is that never have you loved God so purely as now, and
   that never have you been so much loved by Him. But this love is so
   hidden away in the midst of your torments and apparent miseries that
   your director has need of a certain amount of experience to be able to
   recognise it. But have patience, this fearful darkness will be
   succeeded by a clear light, the brilliance of which will delight you.
   Yes, my dear Sister, you can believe me, even though at present you may
   not be able to understand, because I do not tell you anything of which
   God has not given me a certitude. The bitterest part of your trials,
   those ideas of being separated from God, which plunges you into a kind
   of hell, is the most divine of all the operations of divine love in
   you; but the operation is completely hidden beneath altogether contrary
   appearances. It is the fire which seems to destroy the soul while
   purifying it of all self-love, as gold is refined in the crucible. Oh!
   how happy you are, without knowing it! how dear you are without
   understanding it, what great things God effects in your soul in a
   manner so much the more certain the more it is hidden and unrecognized.
   It is our weakness, oh my God, it is our wretched self-love, it is our
   pride that prevent You giving us great graces without hiding them from
   us, or, in other words, without our knowledge, for fear that we should
   corrupt Your gifts by appropriating them to ourselves in foolish,
   secret, and imperceptible self-satisfaction. This, my dear Sister, is
   the whole mystery of the obscure dealings of God in your regard. In
   brief, my dear Sister, fear nothing, keep firm, take courage; God is
   with you and in you, you have nothing to fear even if you were in hell
   in the midst of unchained devils. Nothing can happen to you save by the
   permission of God, and He will permit nothing that will not turn to
   your advantage; therefore you are perfectly safe as long as you confide
   in the goodness of so faithful a friend, so tender a Father, so
   powerful a protector, so passionate a lover and spouse. For these
   tender and loving titles are those which He deigns to give Himself in
   Holy Scripture, and the significance of which He so perfectly fulfils
   in your regard.

  Letter X.--On Mystical Death.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux. Lunéville, 1733.
   On mystical death. Its use.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My very dear daughter,

   I well understand that the state in which it pleases God to place you
   is very painful to nature, but am rather surprised that you should not
   yet comprehend that in this way God desires to effect in you a death
   that will make you live henceforth a life wholly supernatural and
   divine. You have asked Him a hundred times for this mystical death, and
   now that He has answered you, the more your apparent misery increases,
   the more certain you may be that God is effecting that nudity and
   poverty of spirit of which mystics speak. I recommend to you the works
   of Guilloré in which you will find your present state very well
   explained. But you are going to ask me what you should do. Nothing,
   nothing, my daughter, but to let God act, and to be careful not to
   obstruct by an inopportune activity the operation of God; to abstain
   even from sensible acts of resignation, except when you feel that God
   requires them of you. Remain then like a block of wood, and you will
   see later the marvels that God will have worked during that silent
   night of inaction. Self-love, however, cannot endure to behold itself
   thus completely despoiled, and reduced to nothing. Read and read again
   what Guilloré says about this nothing, and you will bless God for
   putting you in possession of treasure. As for me, I also bless Him for
   it, and consider yours an enviable lot, for you must know that there
   are very few whom God gives the grace of passing through a state of
   such great deprivation. The fear of aridity, of which you tell me, is
   the ordinary consequence of this extreme nudity. God upholds you
   insensibly as you experience yourself; and it is proved that this state
   is from God because of the peace that you possess in it apart from the
   senses, and because you would be vexed to be deprived of it. You only
   require patience, resignation, and abandonment, but these dispositions
   should not be felt. Remember that God sees in the depths of your heart
   all your most secret desires. This assurance should be sufficient for
   you; a cry hidden is of the same value as a cry uttered, says the
   Bishop of Meaux. Leave off these reflexions and continual
   self-examinations about what you do, or leave undone; you have
   abandoned yourself entirely to God, and given yourself to Him over and
   over again; you must not take back your offering. Leave the care of
   everything to Him. The comparison you make is very just; God ties your
   hands and feet to be able to carry on His work without interference;
   and you do nothing but struggle, and make every effort, but in vain, to
   break these sacred bonds, and to work yourself according to your own
   inclination. What infidelity! God requires no other work of you but to
   remain peacefully in your chains and weakness. As for your duties, do
   outwardly as well as you can, and I will answer for the interior, for
   God is there in an imperceptible manner to draw you from all that can
   be perceived by the senses. Just the feeling of your own misery and
   corruption demonstrates the presence of God, but of God hiding Himself
   to remain more truly present, and withdrawing Himself to give Himself
   more completely. About this read Guilloré again. God has permitted your
   preliminary imprudence to allow you, without your thinking of it, a
   necessary consolation, and at the same time to mortify and humiliate
   your self-love. Oh! happy imprudence! God, no doubt, permitted the
   second to take you from your occupation. Since you neither spoke, nor
   acted with this intention, have no scruple about it, and think of it no
   more, but allow divine Providence to act. Is it not on His side a truly
   fatherly care which has arranged for you to escape from a false
   position, with the result that you have been at one and the same time
   consoled and humiliated, and left to the satisfaction of the thought
   that you have not contributed in any way to your relief?

   Allow your terror of death and of judgment to increase as much as God
   pleases; do nothing positively either to encourage, or to deliver
   yourself from it; in a word put yourself in God's hands as if you were
   a dead body that can be handled, turned, and moved as He pleases.

   Finally I see nothing more simple, nor more easy than what you should
   do at present, since it consists in letting God do everything, and
   remaining passive yourself. It must be owned, however, that this state
   of inaction is the most cruel torment for our accursed nature which,
   living only for itself, fears the loss of its activities as much as
   death and annihilation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XI.--For the Time of Retreat.

   To the same Sister. Before the Retreat. Nancy, 1734.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The way in which you should make your Retreat is most simple, but
   cannot fail to be painful on account of the interior state in which God
   is pleased to keep your soul at present.

   1st. Do not forget, my dear Sister, that after having passed through
   the first degrees of the spiritual life our further progress is
   affected entirely by the way of losses, destruction, and annihilation.
   To arrive at a spiritual life it is necessary, by the grace of God, to
   die to all created things, to all things sensible and human.
   Consequently you must expect during this Retreat not to enjoy either
   sensible lights, or spiritual pleasures, or an increased desire for
   God, and for divine things; but, on the contrary, to fall into a state
   of greater darkness, an increased distaste, and a more complete apathy.
   Do not then occupy yourself in any other duty than that of receiving
   whatever your sovereign Lord and Master chooses to give you; since,
   after having abandoned yourself entirely to Him, you should regard your
   soul as ground that no longer belongs to you but to Him alone in which
   to sow whatever seed He pleases; light or darkness, pleasure or
   disgust, in a word, all that He pleases; or nothing at all if such
   should be His will. Oh! how terrible to self-love is this nothing! but
   how good and profitable for the soul is this grace, and the life of
   faith. God does not complete His work in us perfectly, unless we become
   firmly established, by our will, in the conviction of our own
   nothingness, because the measure of our resistance, and the impediments
   we place to the divine operations, is the measure also of the
   acquiescence of our will in this state.

   2nd. In this state of despoilment you should never force your
   inclination by means, or about subjects that do not suit you. Simply
   meditate, as far as you are able, on the life and mysteries of Jesus
   Christ. Read the works of St. Francis of Sales, and a few of St. Jane
   de Chantal's letters; those which treat of states of suffering and
   privation. Read especially some of the lives of saints of both sexes
   that are to the point, or an account of the virtues of your holy Rev.
   Mother or Sisters. You will derive instruction and consolation from
   such reading.

   3rd. During the day keep yourself spiritually united to God, receiving
   and accepting from His fatherly Providence all the different
   circumstances that occur with an entire abandonment and total surrender
   of yourself. In this way you will practise true recollection in which
   there is no fear of slothfulness.

   When you feel more attraction or facility in forming acts or colloquies
   with God or our Lord, quietly follow these impressions of grace, but
   without effort or eagerness. Follow the advice of St. Francis of Sales,
   who desires that these acts should flow, or be as though distilled by
   the higher faculties of the soul. The moment it becomes necessary to
   make some effort to continue these acts leave them off at once and
   humbly resume your former state.

   Keep yourself in repose in the depths of your heart, detached from all
   thoughts of exterior things, as Fénélon advises; I mean voluntary
   thoughts; as for those that pass through the mind, take no notice of
   them; however, if you find that you are obsessed by them in spite of
   yourself, then have patience, be at peace, and abandon yourself.

   Unquestionably you must be very faithful and particular in
   accomplishing the exercises marked out for the time of Retreat.

   If you observe these rules you need not fear wasting your time; fear
   only that miserable terror which is the outcome solely of self-love. Do
   not allow yourself to be distracted from simple recollection by this
   trouble, but guard and preserve it as a precious treasure however
   slight, dry, and barren it may be. For with regard to you nothing could
   be more important than this recollection in God, without which it would
   be impossible for Him to accomplish in you His divine work. If you keep
   yourself united to Him you may be assured that He will act in you,
   although it may be in an imperceptible manner, and the result of His
   action should be, at this time, to impoverish and despoil you more and
   more, rather than to enrich and replenish you. When you become, by
   grace, insupportable to yourself, and find not the least satisfaction
   in your good works, nothing remains but to put up with yourself and to
   use towards yourself the same kindness and charity that you employ
   towards your neighbour; it is St. Francis of Sales who gives us this
   advice. Happy is he who by dint of having destroyed self-love, which is
   the false love of oneself, no longer retains any estimation of himself,
   nor any love except that of pure charity, the same that he has for his
   neighbour, or even his enemies, in spite of a sort of contempt and
   horror that he feels towards himself. Many more trials will be
   necessary before arriving at that degree of perfection in which
   self-love ceases to exist, and is replaced by the real love of pure
   charity. I pray God with all my heart to give you this grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XII.--After the Retreat.

   To the same Sister. After the Retreat. November 4th, 1734.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1st. I must begin by telling you frankly that, although naturally
   compassionate, I cannot pity you, but even rejoiced interiorly in God
   while perusing your letter. What I had the temerity to predict when you
   began your Retreat has come to pass.

   2nd. You know what I think about a keen feeling of your weakness and
   powerlessness. Fénélon says that this is a grace to make us despair of
   ourselves in order that we may hope only in God. It is then, he adds,
   that God begins to work marvels in a soul. But usually He performs His
   work in a hidden manner and without the soul's knowledge, to preserve
   it from the snares of self-love.

   3rd. The way in which God made you pass the feast of All Saints was
   very hard to nature, but by grace very wholesome. Blind that we are! we
   must let God act. If He allowed us to follow our own desires and ideas,
   even those that are, apparently, very holy, instead of making progress
   we only go back.

   4th. You feel as if you had neither faith, hope, nor charity; this is
   because God has deprived you of all perception of these virtues, and
   retained them in the highest part of the soul. He thus affords you an
   opportunity of making a complete sacrifice of all satisfaction, and
   this is better than anything. Of what then do you complain? It is
   disconsolate nature which grieves because it feels nothing but
   troubles, dryness, and spiritual anguish. These are its death, a
   necessary death in order to receive the new life of grace, a life
   altogether holy and divine. I am acquainted with some whose souls
   frequently pass through the most terrible agonies, so that it seems to
   them, as to you, as if every moment would be their last; just as a
   criminal on the rack expects the finishing stroke which, while
   depriving him of the miserable remnant of his life, will put an end to
   his torments. Courage, patience, abandonment, and confidence in God;
   these are the virtues you must practice. He accords you a great grace,
   a signal favour, in allowing you from time to time some slight
   perception of His help. The different shocks this good Master allows
   you to experience, the vivid recollection of your sins and miseries,
   are divine operations, very crucifying, and intended to purify you like
   gold in the crucible. Why then should I pity you? I have far more
   reason to congratulate you, as the holy martyrs in ancient times were
   congratulated, who considered themselves happy in the midst of their
   torments and cruel tortures.

   5th. The regret that you are tempted to feel as regards the
   consolations you enjoyed in previous Retreats is only an illusion which
   you must carefully guard against. Never have you, with God's grace,
   made such a useful Retreat. This He has made you feel by giving you
   strength sufficient to enable you to sacrifice sensible pleasure and
   consolation. "But," you add, "God has rejected this sacrifice." Here
   again is temptation and illusion. God permits it in order to try you in
   every way. Fiat! Fiat! If God takes away your peace of mind, very well,
   let it go with the rest; God remains always, and when nothing else is
   left to you, you will be able to love Him with greater purity. He alone
   it is, then, who works in a divine way at our perfection through these
   spiritual deprivations which are so abhorrent to nature, for they are
   its death, its annihilation, and final destruction. Have patience.
   Fiat! Fiat! You cannot follow the path of perfection in reality except
   through losses, abnegation, despoilment, death to all things, complete
   annihilation, and unreserved abandonment. We need not be astonished
   when we experience afflictions, when even our reason totters, that poor
   reason so blind in the ways of faith; for it is a strange blindness
   which leads us to aspire after perfection by the way of illumination,
   of spiritual joy and consolation, the infallible result of which would
   be to revive ever more and more our self-love and to enable it to spoil
   everything.

   6th. Just the keen feeling of your own frailty has been one of your
   greatest helps, because by making you realise that you are exposed to
   the danger of falling at every step it inspires you with an absolute
   self-distrust, and makes you practise a blind confidence in God; in
   this sense the Apostle says, "When I feel myself weakest, then it is
   that I am strongest, because the keen feeling of my weakness invests
   me, through a more perfect confidence, with all the power of Jesus
   Christ."

   7th. There is nothing more simple than the conduct you ought to follow
   in order to derive great profit from your painful and crucifying state;
   an habitual consent from your heart, a humble "fiat," a complete
   abandonment, and perfect confidence, that is all. From morning to night
   you have nothing else to do. It will appear to you that you are doing
   nothing, but all will be done; and so much the better, the more
   profound the humility with which you remain without the help of those
   miserable satisfactions which do not satisfy God, but your self-love,
   as our very dear father, St. Francis of Sales, repeats.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Letter XIII.--The Fear of Reprobation.

   On the purification of the soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   While reading your letter I had no sooner arrived at the part where you
   depicted your suffering state than an involuntary impulse led me to
   cast myself interiorly at the feet of Jesus Christ to thank Him for it.
   A thousand experiences convince me more thoroughly every day that
   interior trials purify a soul, in its very essence, and penetrate to
   its most hidden recesses, and sanctify it more efficaciously than any
   exterior crosses, mortifications, or penances. I can but bless God,
   therefore, for the great goodness He shows you, and encourage you to
   correspond faithfully thereto. For this purpose you have only to
   observe the following points.

   1st. Neither in the present circumstances, nor during the whole time
   that your trial lasts must you expect to receive any other consolation
   than it pleases God to give you; for not even an angel from Heaven
   could draw a soul out of the crucible in which God keeps it, to purify
   it more and more.

   2nd. Moreover, it is certain that the interior crucifixion is so much
   the greater the greater the degree of love and union with him to which
   God intends to raise the soul.

   3rd. The fear of being lost does not seem to me at all extraordinary,
   in fact it is common enough with those good souls whom God designs to
   raise to a state of perfection.

   4th. In this matter God seems to me to give in to your weakness by
   giving you an abandonment and confidence in Him which He even renders
   perceptible to you occasionally. How many souls in this state are
   deprived of such a consolation!

   5th. In this matter, as in all others, God teaches you by the spiritual
   impressions of His grace, that He brings you to practise, exactly, and
   continually, all that He requires of you, so that I can content myself
   with saying just two things; first, your present state seems to me the
   best that you have ever been in during your whole life, and the
   greatest grace that you have hitherto received. Secondly, God teaches
   you all that is necessary about it; go on, and be at peace.

   However, let us see if, in re-reading your letter God will enable me to
   clear up, by some explanation, the already perfectly sufficient
   direction that I am giving you in His name. First, all those thoughts
   by which God is represented as having ceased to extend to you that
   infinite mercy which is His attribute, are but the groundwork of your
   trial. They are the distinctive features of that deep fear of
   reprobation that God wills you to endure. This suffering is your
   martyrdom, and these different suggestions of the enemy are the
   different arrows that he lets fly by the divine permission. Instead of
   wounding your body they pierce your heart and your soul, and are none
   the less meritorious on that account. Secondly, that idea and
   conviction that the measure of your sins is filled up is decidedly
   inspired by the father of lies, and not by the Holy Spirit; however,
   although God is not the author, He nevertheless permits you to be
   tormented by it, and permits it for your good. Besides this trial being
   very humiliating, the suffering it causes is like a fire, which cannot
   fail to purify you the more completely the more intense are its flames,
   and the more frequently your soul is plunged into the crucible.
   Thirdly, your supposed lukewarmness, your dryness, and want of feeling,
   are the results and effects of this unhappy persuasion impressed on
   your mind; these are the flames which are intended--not to consume, but
   to purify the victim in order to render it more capable of being
   consumed by the fire of divine love. Fourthly, I say the same of those
   efforts of your heart to rush towards God; those efforts to which God
   seems to make no other reply than to repulse you. These are, in some
   souls, so violent and painful that they produce what Bossuet calls
   despairing love--or the despair of love. This movement which is only
   despairing in appearance is, in reality, the most vehement form of
   love. This, says this great Bishop, is the way that grace sometimes
   imitates the effect of the profane love of creatures on those who are
   carried away by it. Fifthly, it is an additional grace to be able to
   make the heroic act of St. Francis of Sales, and to say, "If I must be
   separated from my God for all eternity, at any rate while I live I will
   love Him and serve Him." This is a help of which many souls are
   deprived; make use of it then, but do not depend upon it, because God
   may take it away from you, or prevent you being aware of it.

   6th. It is very wise to multiply your communions in a state in which
   this support is most necessary. You ought to consider yourself very
   fortunate in being able to avail yourself of this help.

   7th. Faith, abandonment, confidence, hope, against hope; these are the
   most powerful aids you can have. However if God should deprive you of
   the consolation of feeling these virtues, nothing remains but to
   abandon yourself entirely, without limitation, and even without any
   help that you can feel or perceive. Then will God sustain you in the
   depths of your soul in an incomprehensible manner; but the poor soul,
   being unable to feel any kind of support, and imagining itself
   completely forsaken, experiences a kind of grief that makes this state
   a kind of hell. You, however, are, as yet, only in purgatory, but this
   Purgatory is so purifying, and so filled with treasures of grace, that
   I pray God not to take you out of it until He has enriched you with
   treasures for eternity, and rendered you as pure and right in His sight
   as so many saintly souls have become by virtue of these same trials.

   8th. The peace that you enjoy in suffering is the true peace of God,
   without fear of any admixture of illusion. Instead of fidelity,
   courage, strength, and fervour in prayer, you find in yourself nothing
   but infidelity, weakness, tepidity, and indevotion. This must be. It is
   what will effect your annihilation before God. Oh! happy state of
   annihilation! A holy person told me some days ago that she would be
   afraid to be taken out of a certain fearful state. "Why so?" I asked
   her, "Because, Father," she replied, "I am afraid that I might lose my
   state of nothingness before God, which is, to me, more delightful than
   those other sensible, sweet and consoling graces." Here are a few words
   for your dear Sister, for I notice that with regard to both of you God
   leaves little for the director to do; from which I conclude, by the
   way, that neither of you requires to consult him often. To do so would
   be a sort of infidelity to the great spiritual Master who wishes to
   lead you both entirely Himself. To return to the point.

   1st. It seems to me that God has, hitherto, made the most of the
   weakness of this dear Sister. Darkness and aridity are trials in a less
   painful sense, and yet they are very fruitful because the soul, being
   unable to perceive anything, has no power to spoil anything, and
   consequently is led to a more perfect abandonment. Hers increases, she
   says, in an astonishing manner. This is the acme of grace, because all
   perfection is to be found in the most perfect abandonment in which our
   will is lost in the will of God. Love practised like this is the most
   pure, and is sheltered from all illusion and from all vain recourse to
   self-love.

   2nd. The ineffable consolations experienced by this good Sister before
   she fell into this state of obscurity and dryness, was only a merciful
   kindness of grace, intended to gain the foundation and centre of the
   soul in which God wished to establish His dwelling and from thence to
   work insensibly. These consolations were a great grace, but the present
   want of feeling is a much greater one.

   3rd. The good Sister should therefore remain as well as she can, in
   this state of simple surrender, or simple waiting, and not leave it
   except under the impulse of a movement of interior grace, and only so
   far as this movement allows: for one must never either forestall
   attractions, or go beyond them.

  Letter XIV.--Explanations and Direction.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux. Explanation of
   certain trials. Direction. Nancy, 1734.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   As long as you continue abandoning yourself to God as you are doing at
   present, I assure you in His name that He will never abandon you. The
   experiences of the past and the present are your guarantee for the
   future. I acknowledge that the path by which our Lord conducts you is
   very hard to nature; but, besides the fact that He is the Master, He
   allows you to reflect from time to time on the advantages and security
   of this way, also to consider its necessity. It is the usual way by
   which God conducts His chosen spouses to the perfection He destines
   them to attain; and I have known very few whom He has not judged it
   necessary to guide along this path when they give themselves up
   entirely to Him. Why then are there such painful states? Why this
   heaviness of heart which takes the pleasure out of everything? and this
   depression which makes life insupportable? Why? It is to destroy, in
   those souls destined to a perfect union with God, a certain base of
   hidden presumption; to attack pride in its last retreat; to overwhelm
   with bitterness that cursed self-love which is only content with what
   gives it pleasure; until at last, not knowing where to turn, it dies
   for want of food and attention, as a fire goes out for want of fuel to
   feed it. This death, however, is not the work of a moment; a great
   quantity of water is required to extinguish a great conflagration.

   Self-love is like a many-headed hydra, and its heads have to be cut off
   successively. It has many lives that have to be destroyed one after the
   other if one wishes to be completely delivered. You have, doubtless,
   obtained a great advantage by making it die to nature and the senses;
   but do not dream that you are entirely set free from its obsessions. It
   recovers from this first defeat and renews its attacks on another
   ground. More subtle in future, it begins again on that which is
   sensible in devotion; and it is to be feared that this second attempt,
   apparently much less crude, and more justifiable than its predecessor,
   is also much more powerful. Nevertheless, pure love cannot put up with
   the one any more than with the other. God cannot suffer sensible
   consolations to share a heart that belongs to Him. What then will
   happen? If less privileged souls are in question, for whom God has not
   such a jealous love, He allows them a peaceful enjoyment of these holy
   pleasures, and contents Himself with the sacrifice they have made of
   the pleasures of sense. This is, in fact, the ordinary course with
   devout persons, whose piety is somewhat mixed with a certain amount of
   self-seeking. Assuredly God does not approve of their defects; but, as
   they have received fewer graces, He is less exacting in the matter of
   perfection. These are the ordinary spouses of an inferior rank, whose
   beauty needs not to be so irreproachable, for they have not the power
   to wound His divine heart so keenly; but He has far other requirements,
   as He has quite other designs with regard to His chosen spouses. The
   jealousy of His love equals its tenderness. Desiring to give Himself
   entirely to them, He wishes also to possess their whole heart without
   division. Therefore He would not be satisfied with the exterior crosses
   and pains which detach from creatures but desires to detach them from
   themselves, and to destroy in them to the last fibre that self-love
   which is rooted in feelings of devotion, is supported and nourished by
   them, and finds its satisfaction in them. To effect this second death
   He withdraws all consolation, all pleasure, all interior help, insomuch
   that the poor soul finds itself as though suspended between Heaven and
   earth, without the consolations of the one, nor the comforts of the
   other. For a human being who cannot exist without pleasure and without
   love, this seems a sort of annihilation. Nothing then remains for him
   but to attach himself--not with the heart which no longer feels
   anything, but with the essence of the soul--to God alone, whom he knows
   and perceives by bare faith in an obscure manner. Oh! it is then that
   the soul, perfectly purified by this two-fold death, enters into a
   spiritual alliance with God, and possesses Him in the pure delights of
   purified love; which never could have been the case if its spiritual
   taste had not been doubly purified.

   But this carries me too far. Let us return to your letter.

   What a number of false steps! you say. But do you not know the remedy?
   To humble yourself gently, rise again, and to take courage. "But," you
   add, "I do this with so much repugnance, trouble, weariness, and
   sadness." This is precisely what increases the merit, and makes you
   acquire solid virtue, because it is only by gaining it at the point of
   the sword that it is so, says St. Francis of Sales. "Our surroundings
   are very depressing." I understand that perfectly, and it is precisely
   on this account that God attacks your heart in its weakest point.
   "Indeed, my daughter," said St. Francis of Sales, "this is to gain it
   all for Himself, this poor heart." Well then, give it to Him, at first,
   perhaps, against your inclination, but later more amiably, when that
   grace that He has taken away, which was so sweet and alluring, returns
   again but without being felt. "But I am not sure that I do love, all
   that I know is that I try to love." Well, that is all that God requires
   of you. It is a received axiom in theology that God never refuses grace
   to him who does all that is in his power to acquire it. Try then to
   love Him, and if these efforts are not the fruit of love, they will
   obtain for you the grace of charity. God already gives you a great
   favour in inspiring you with the desire to love Him. Some day, I hope,
   He will lead you further, and satisfy this desire. Say to yourself, "I
   should be consoled, even overwhelmed with consolation if I felt towards
   God what I try to feel, but at present God wishes to take from me all
   interior consolation, to make me die the second death which should
   precede that completely supernatural and divine life of His Holy
   Spirit, of His grace and pure love."

   Now I come to a beautiful part of your letter which rejoices my heart
   before God. You say; "I should like, very humbly, to remonstrate, but
   instead I will remain on my cross through obedience even if I have to
   die there." Here indeed the good God gives and inspires you with a
   great courage. He holds you, therefore, always in His hand; what have
   you to fear? No, you will not die of it, my dear daughter, except only
   by a spiritual death more precious than any earthly life. "Yes," you
   add, "but all the same I should be very glad and much relieved if God
   would take me out of this state, or these circumstances." The saints in
   a thousand similar cases would say the same, but the more one would
   like to be relieved of a position or duty, the more merit there is in
   being willing to remain in it if such is the will of God. Be consoled,
   therefore, put your mind at rest and remain in peace. God is with you
   and a God all goodness, who bears with the weakness, miseries, and
   frailties of His good friends with a tender compassion even to the
   extent of forbidding them to distress themselves; and why? Because He
   wishes all whom He loves to enjoy an unalterable peace. Frequent acts
   of the love of God, or even of a holy desire to love Him, are an
   excellent remedy for the fear of divine judgments, and for the terrors
   about predestination. I am not at all surprised at the happy results of
   this remedy. I much approve, also, of the reply you made to the person
   who told you that she did not love God with sufficient
   disinterestedness. This is a visible illusion of the devil, who, under
   pretext of I know not what self-love, wants to keep this soul back, and
   to retard itself progress. Tell her that self-love (I allude to
   spiritual self-love which, although not sinful, tarnishes the perfect
   purity of divine love) is only found in those souls who make of the
   gifts of God, or of His rewards, a motive to love Him for their sakes.
   To love God for Himself, and because He is God, and inasmuch as He is
   our own God, our great reward, our sovereign good, infinitely good to
   us, is the pure and practical love of the saints; for to love one's
   supreme happiness, which is God Himself, is to love God alone. These
   two terms express the same thing, and it is impossible to love God
   otherwise than as He is in Himself. Besides, in Himself He is our
   supreme good, our last end, and our eternal happiness. But, some will
   say, supposing that God were not our eternal happiness, ought we not to
   love Him just the same, for Himself? Oh! what a strange and pitiable
   supposition! It is as much as to say: If God were not God. Do not let
   us split hairs so much, but go on in a direct and simple manner,
   broadmindedly, as St. Francis of Sales advises. Let us love God with
   simplicity and as well as we can, and He will raise and purify our love
   ever more and more according to His own good pleasure. As for you, keep
   to the spiritual condition in which God has been pleased to place you.
   The fear of death and terrors about the judgments of God and about
   eternity, were endured by St. Jerome for a longer time and much more
   severely than by you. Let us be willing to retain these strong
   impressions for as long as God pleases. Our own will should be ready to
   die, to be extinguished, and happily lost in that of God, which is
   always equally loving, perfect and adorable.

  Letter XV.--Perfect Detachment.

   To Sister Marie-Antoinette de Mahuet. Nancy, 1735.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   In sending you what is necessary to prosecute the work of charity which
   I recommended to you, the thought occurred to me to lay before you some
   of the certain and very consoling truths concerning souls who give
   themselves up to an interior life.

   First Principle. Union with God, the source of all purity, can only be
   attained according to the degree in which the soul is detached from all
   things created, which are the source of continual corruption and
   impurity.

   Second Principle. This detachment, which, when it has attained
   perfection, is called mystical death, has two objects; the exterior,
   that is to say, creatures other than ourselves; and interior, that is
   to say, our own ideas, satisfactions, and interests--in one
   word--ourselves. The proof and sign of the death of all that is
   external is a sort of indifference, or rather of insensibility with
   regard to exterior goods, pleasures, reputation, relations, friends,
   etc. This insensibility becomes, by the help of grace, so complete and
   so profound that one is tempted to imagine it purely natural; and God
   permits this to prevent the artifices of self-complacency, and to make
   us in all things, walk in the obscurity of faith, and in a great
   abandonment.

   Third Principle: Interior privation, or death to self, is the most
   difficult renunciation of all; it is as though we were torn away from
   ourselves, or were flayed alive. The excruciating pain experienced by
   self-love, and the cries it utters, are an index to the power of the
   links which attach us to the creature, and to the necessity of this
   renunciation; for, the deeper the knife of the surgeon penetrates to
   the quick, the keener is the pain; and the greater the vitality one
   has, the stronger is the resistance to this death. The soul, therefore,
   cannot arrive at this happy death and perfect detachment except by way
   of privations and interior renunciation. It requires a proved and
   heroic virtue to acquire a stripping of the heart in the midst of
   abundance; and renunciation in the midst of pleasures. It is therefore,
   on the part of God, a favour and mercy to strip us of all sensible
   gifts and favours; just as it is an effect of His mercy to despoil
   worldly people of temporal goods to detach their hearts from them. What
   is to be done then while God is effecting this denuding? This--to allow
   oneself to be deprived of everything without any resistance, as if one
   were a statue. But what about interior rebellion? It must be put up
   with and no attention paid to it. But if one feels that one is not
   bearing this state of deprivation properly? This additional trial must
   be endured like that of despoilment, peacefully without voluntary
   trouble. But what if you are not certain that this deprivation comes
   from God? As it is now a question of cutting off self-love, which for
   its own consolation seeks impossible certitude in everything, this is
   the answer that should be given.

   Fourth Principle. 1st, It is certain that without a special revelation
   God does not let us have any assurance about that which concerns our
   eternal salvation. Why so? To make us walk in darkness, and thus to
   render our faith more meritorious on account of the obscurity in which
   it leaves the reason. 2nd, To keep us always in a state of the deepest
   humiliation as a counter-poise to the natural and strong inclination to
   pride. 3rd, To exercise over us His sovereign dominion, and to keep us
   in the most absolute dependence and the most complete abandonment to
   His will, not only with regard to our temporal existence, but also as
   regards our eternal destiny. This is what makes religion apparently
   most terrible, but it has another aspect that is sweet and consoling:
   no sooner do we submit, while trembling, to the sovereign dominion of
   God, and to His incomprehensible judgments, than we experience the
   greatest consolation. This is because in His mercy He gives us, instead
   of certainty, a firm hope which is of equal value, without depriving us
   of the merit of abandonment, so glorious to God, and for us deserving
   of so great a reward. On what then is this firm hope founded? On the
   treasures of the infinite mercy and infinite and merits of Jesus
   Christ; on all the graces that have hitherto been heaped upon us; on
   the judgment of the directors whose office it is to judge of our state
   and disposition; on the clear light of faith which cannot deceive, and
   which we follow in our conduct; at any rate, in what is essential, such
   as overcoming sin, and practising virtue. We see, in fact, that by the
   grace of God we habitually practise these virtues, and that if we do so
   very imperfectly we at least desire to practise them better. But in
   spite of all this there is always some fear remaining. If it is that
   fear which is called chaste, peaceful, and free from anxiety, then it
   is the true fear of God which must always be retained. Where there is
   no fear, there will assuredly be an illusion of the devil; but should
   this fear be uneasy and wild, it must then be caused by self-love, and
   for this we must lament and humble ourselves.

   But when one has accomplished this total destitution, what then?

   Remain in simplicity and in peace, like Job on his dung-hill, often
   repeating "Blessed are the poor in spirit, he who has nothing, in
   possessing God possesses all things." "Leave all, strip yourself of
   all," said the celebrated Gerson, and you will find all in God. God,
   felt, enjoyed, and giving pleasure, is truly God; but He bestows gifts
   for which the soul flatters itself; but God in darkness, in privations,
   in destitution, in unconsciousness, is God alone, and as it were,
   naked. This, however, is a little hard on self-love, that enemy of God,
   of our own souls, and of all good; and it is by the force of these
   blows that it is finally put to death in us. Shall we fear a death that
   produces within us the life of grace, that divine life? But it is very
   hard to have to pass one's life in this way! What does it matter? A
   little more or less of sweetness during the short moments of life? It
   is indeed a small matter for one who has before his eyes an eternal
   kingdom. But I suffer all this destitution so imperfectly, so feebly!
   Another unfelt grace; God preserve you from suffering with great
   courage, and a strength that can be realised. What an amount of secret
   complacency, of idle reflexions about yourself, would result to spoil
   the work of God! An invisible hand supports you enough to render you
   victorious, and the keen sense of your weakness makes you humble even
   in victory. Oh! how advantageous it is to endure feebly and patiently
   rather than to suffer grandly, powerfully, and courageously. We are
   humiliated and feel our weakness and littleness in these sort of
   victories, while in the other kind we feel that we ate behaving
   grandly, strongly, and courageously, and without perceiving it we
   become inflated with vanity, presumption, and self-satisfaction. Let us
   admire the wisdom and the goodness of God, who so well knows how to mix
   and proportion all things for our profit and advantage; whereas if He
   arranged matters to our liking all would be spoiled, corrupted and,
   possibly, lost.

  Letter XVI.--Explanation of Apparent Despair.

   To Mother Louise-Françoise de Rosen (1735). Explanation of apparent
   despair.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   One must never take the extreme expressions made use of by orthodox
   writers quite rigidly, but enter into the meaning and thought of the
   authors. One ought, without doubt, to prevent good souls from making
   use of expressions, coolly and with premeditation, which seem to savour
   of despair; but it would be unjust to condemn those who, driven almost
   out of their senses by the violence of their trials, speak and act as
   if they had no hope of eternal happiness. It does not do to feel
   scandalised at their language, nor to imagine it actuated by a real
   despair. It is really rather a feeling of confidence hidden in the
   depths of the soul which makes them speak thus; just as criminals have
   been sometimes known to present themselves before their sovereign with
   a rope round their neck saying that they gave themselves up to all the
   severity of his justice. Do you imagine that it was despair that made
   them speak in this way? or was it not rather an excess of confidence in
   the prince's goodness? And, as a rule, they obtain their pardon by the
   excess of their sorrow, repentance, and confidence. Will God then be
   less good with regard to souls who abandon themselves to Him for time
   and for eternity? Will He take literally expressions which, in the
   main, only signify transports of abandonment and confidence? It is for
   want of a just appreciation of these ideas that you thought it
   necessary to erase similar expressions in the book "Interior
   Christian." For my part when I find such expressions in good authors'
   books, far from being scandalised, I feel much edified. I admire the
   strength of abandonment and discover an excess of confidence, so much
   the more meritorious as it is less perceptible, in a soul which utters
   these sentiments in a moment of excitement. These extraordinary states
   are, in the order of grace, what miracles are in the order of nature.
   They raise the soul above ordinary laws, but without destroying them.
   Far from appearing to me contrary to the wisdom of God, they make me
   admire His power.

  Letter XVII.--Abandonment in Trials.

   To Sister Charlotte-Elizabeth Bourcier de Monthureux. On the practice
   of abandonment in the midst of trials. Nancy, 1734.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My dear Sister,

   I must thank you for the charming letter of which you have been so good
   as to send me a copy. I have read and re-read it frequently with great
   edification. My experience regarding yourself is something that has
   hardly ever occurred to me before; it is, that after having read your
   letter several times and implored the help of God, I cannot remember
   either what you have said, or what I have written to you in reply.
   About this, three considerations have presented themselves to me.
   Firstly, if God wishes to withdraw from a soul all sensible support, He
   does not permit it to find any, even in its director, unless in a very
   passing way. Thus He reduces it to find help in this thought alone; my
   state is a good one, since the guide appointed for me by God finds it
   so. Secondly, what does God find it necessary for me to say after the
   letter which I judged before God to suit you perfectly, and to fully
   suffice? Thirdly, in spite of your darkness, want of feeling, and
   stupidity, your faith does not lack an immovable, although unfelt,
   support; since, following the example of Jesus Christ, you have a great
   desire to abandon yourself to the very One by whom you believe yourself
   to be abandoned and forsaken. This is an evident sign that in the midst
   of your supposed destitution and apparent abandonment, you recognise by
   pure faith interiorly that you have never been, in the main, less
   forsaken, nor less friendless than now. Does not the spiritual
   affliction which the fear of not being able to abandon yourself in all
   things, nor as well as you desire, occasions you, prove the deep and
   hidden intention which is rooted in your heart, of practising this
   total abandonment and abnegation that are so meritorious? Does not God
   behold these desires, so deep and so hidden, and do they not speak for
   you to God more powerfully than any words you could utter? Yes,
   certainly, these desires are acts, and better acts than any others, for
   if you were allowed to practise abandonment in a manner that you could
   feel, you would find consolation, but would lose, at least somewhat,
   the salutary feeling of your misery, and would be again exposed to the
   imperceptible snares of self-love, and to its fatal satisfactions.
   Remain therefore in peace and wait for our Lord. This peaceful and
   humble expectation ought to keep you recollected, serve as subject for
   meditation, and occupy you quietly during your exercises of piety.

  Letter XVIII.--Fruit of Death to Self.

   To Mother Marie-Anne-Sophie de Rottenbourg. On the fruit of complete
   death to self. 1739.
     __________________________________________________________________

   May God be praised, Reverend Mother, for the signal graces He has been
   pleased to bestow upon you! Henceforth your principal care should be to
   guard with a vigilant humility these precious gifts.

   1st. Your rest in God during prayer comes, without any doubt, from the
   Holy Spirit. Be careful not to forsake, by any inopportune multiplicity
   of acts, this simplicity, which is the more fruitful the more closely
   it resembles the infinite simplicity of God. This way of uniting
   yourself to Him by a total seif-abnegation is based on the great
   principle that God, who is Almighty and goodness itself, gives to His
   children on all occasions and always what He knows will be best for
   them; and that all perfection consists in a constant adhesion of the
   heart to His adorable will. By this simple and humble behaviour all our
   desires are gradually absorbed by the will of God into which it becomes
   completely transformed. When we have reached this point we shall have
   attained perfection.

   2nd. If God does not permit you to derive any other fruit from your
   illness than the recognition of the continual loss of grace sustained
   by a soul which pays but scant attention to its interior movements, I
   should still cry, "Oh! happy, thrice happy illness!"

   3rd. Speak then to your dear daughters without ceasing of the great
   duties imposed upon them by the divine love, and of the priceless
   advantages of the spiritual life. Oh! how few there are who understand
   this, and fewer still who practise it. Nowadays hardly any exercises
   are understood and valued but those that are exterior, yet God is a
   pure spirit whom we must adore, as Jesus Christ teaches, in spirit and
   in truth. Where then, Oh my God, are to be found those who fulfil this
   precept?

   4th. To feel no surprise at one's miseries is a good beginning for a
   humility founded on self-knowledge; but to feel no trouble at the keen
   and habitual recollection of them is a very great grace, and the source
   of a complete distrust of self, and of a true and perfect confidence in
   God.

   5th. Your devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ, and the
   practices you have adopted with regard to it, are a real spiritual
   treasure which will serve to enrich yourself, and your dear daughters.
   The more you draw on this treasure the more there is left for your
   enrichment, for it is inexhaustible.

   6th. What you have learnt from the venerable Fr. de Condran about the
   spirit of sacrifice is indeed a most excellent practice; but it cannot
   be continual, nor constant, except in the spiritual life, which alone
   enables us to attend to, and to be faithful in everything.

   7th. The humbling of the heart and soul concerning all faults, known
   and unknown, appeases God, and draws down fresh light and renewed
   strength, so that the whole subject resolves itself into knowing how,
   thoroughly, to humble oneself, that is to say, how to remain before God
   always in a state of spiritual humiliation, with a contrite heart, and
   sorrow for sin. Then it is that we walk before God in truth and
   justice, according to the holy Scriptures. In any other state we should
   be in error and falsehood, and, consequently, far from God who is the
   sovereign truth.

   8th. It is a beautiful gift of heaven to be able to govern in a spirit
   of meekness and moderation; this will prove more efficacious and
   salutary both for yourself and others, and make you avoid those faults
   into which a bitter, indiscreet, and too active zeal would make you
   fall. When you have to direct the aged, your conduct ought to be full
   of wisdom and humble charity; and with young Religious of good will,
   but still rather weak and not sufficiently courageous, you should be
   doubly gentle and condescending, and act with moderation and prudence.

   I end where I began, by blessing God for the graces He has bestowed
   upon you, and by begging Him to continue them to you. On no account,
   Reverend Mother, leave off this total self-forgetfulness to which I
   have so often exhorted you, and which the divine goodness has effected
   in you. In fact, why should one be so much engrossed in oneself? The
   true self is God, since He is more completely the life of the soul than
   the soul is the life of the body. God created us for Himself alone; let
   us think then of Him, and He will think of us, and provide for us much
   better than we can for ourselves. When we fall, let us humble
   ourselves, and rise again, and go on our way in peace, and think always
   of our true self which is God, in whom we should lose ourselves and be
   engulfed, in the way in which we shall find ourselves absorbed and
   engulfed in Heaven during the infinite duration of the great day of
   eternity. Amen! Amen!
