                             AN ESTIMATE OF MANTON.

BY THE REV. J. C. RYLE.

   THE publication of a complete and uniform edition of Manton's works is
   a great boon to the readers of English theology. Many of his best
   writings have been hitherto inaccessible to all who have not long
   purses and large libraries. The few who know him would gladly testify,
   I am sure, that Thomas Manton was one of the best authors of his day,
   and that his works richly deserve reprinting.

   The republication of this great divine's writings in their present form
   appears to demand a few prefatory remarks. What are Manton's special
   merits? What claim has a man of the seventeenth century on the
   attention of 1871? What good thing is there about him that we should
   buy him and read him? These are reasonable questions, to which I
   propose to supply an answer in the following brief essay. A cairn
   examination of Manton's real worth appears a suitable accompaniment to
   a new edition of Manton's works.

   The inquiry, it must be admitted, is not an easy one. The materials for
   forming a judgment are singularly few and scanty. Two hundred years
   have passed away since Manton was laid in the grave. He died in an age
   when his principles and his party were very unpopular, and few cared to
   be known as his friends and admirers. Except the long and exhaustive
   biography of him by Harris, which has been wisely reprinted in this
   edition, we possess little information about him. All other impressions
   about him must be based on a patient analysis of his voluminous
   posthumous works. Considerable familiarity with these works forms my
   principal claim on the reader's attention in sending forth this essay.

   Let me clear the way by considering an objection which is frequently
   brought against Manton and other divines of his school That objection
   is that he was "a Puritan." I admit the fact, and do not deny it for a
   moment. A friend and associate of Baxter, Calamy, Owen, and Bates--a
   leading man in all the fruitless conferences between Puritans and
   Churchmen in the early part of Charles II.'s reign--ejected from St
   Paul's, Covent Garden, by the disgraceful Act of Uniformity--a sufferer
   even unto bonds on account of his Nonconformist opinions,--if ever
   there was an English divine who must be classed as a Puritan, that man
   is Dr Manton. But what of it, if he was a Puritan? It does not prove
   that he was not a valuable theologian, an admirable writer, and an
   excellent man. Let me once for all make a few plain statements about
   the school to which Manton belonged--the school of the English
   Puritans. It is one of those points in the ecclesiastical history of
   our country about which the ignorance of most Englishmen is deep and
   astounding. There are more baseless and false ideas current about them
   than about any class of men in British history. The impressions of most
   people are so ridiculously incorrect, that one could laugh if the
   subject were not so serious. To hear them talk about Puritans is simply
   ludicrous. They make assertions which prove either that they know
   nothing at all of what they are talking about, or that they have
   forgotten the ninth commandment. For Dr Manton's sake, and for the
   honour of a cruelly misrepresented body of men, let me try to explain
   to the reader what the Puritans really were. He that supposes they were
   ignorant, fanatical sectaries, haters of the Crown and Church of
   England--men alike destitute of learning, holiness, or loyalty--has got
   a great deal to learn. Let him hear some plain facts, which I will
   venture to copy from a work written by myself in 1868 ("Bishops and
   Clergy of other Days").

   "The Puritans were not enemies to the monarchy. It is simply false to
   say that they were. The great majority of them protested strongly
   against the execution of Charles I., and were active agents in bringing
   back Charles II. to England, and placing the crown on his head after
   Oliver Cromwell's death. The base ingratitude with which they were
   afterwards treated, in 1662, by the very monarch whom they helped to
   restore, is one of the most shameful pages in the history of the
   Stuarts.

   "The Puritans were not enemies to the Church of England. They would
   gladly have had her government and ceremonial improved, and more
   liberty allowed in the conduct of public worship. And they were quite
   right! The very things which they desired to see, but never saw, are
   actually recommended at this day as worthy of adoption by Churchmen in
   every part of the land! The great majority of them were originally
   ordained by bishops, and had no abstract objection to Episcopacy. The
   great majority of them had no special dislike to liturgies, but only to
   certain details in the Book of Common Prayer. Baxter, one of their
   leaders, expressly testifies that a very few concessions in 1662 would
   have retained in the Church of England at least sixteen hundred of the
   two thousand who were driven out by the Act of Uniformity on
   Bartholomew's Day.

   "The Puritans were not unlearned and ignorant men. The great majority
   of them were Oxford and Cambridge graduates--many of them fellows of
   colleges, and some of them heads or principals of the best colleges in
   the two Universities. In knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in
   power as preachers, expositors, writers, and critics, the Puritans in
   their day were second to none. Their works still speak for them on the
   shelves of every well-furnished theological library. Their
   commentaries, their expositions, their treatises on practical,
   casuistical, and experimental divinity, are immeasurably superior to
   those of their adversaries in the seventeenth century. In short, those
   who hold up the Puritans to scorn as shallow, illiterate men, are only
   exposing their own lamentable shallowness, their own ignorance of
   historical facts, and the extremely superficial character of their own
   reading.

   "The Puritans, as a body, have done more to elevate the national
   character than any class of Englishmen that ever lived. Ardent lovers
   of civil liberty, and ready to die in its defence--mighty at the
   council board, and no less mighty in the battlefield--feared abroad
   throughout Europe, and invincible at home while united--great with
   their pens, and no less great with their swords--fearing God very much,
   and fearing man very little,--they were a generation of men who have
   never received from their country the honour that they deserve. The
   body of which Milton, Selden, Blake, Cromwell, Owen, Baxter, and
   Charnock were members, is a body of which no well-informed Englishman
   ought ever to speak with disrespect. He may dislike their principles,
   if he will, but he has no right to despise them. Lord Macaulay, no mean
   authority in matters of English history, might well say, in his famous
   essay on Milton, We do not hesitate to pronounce the Puritans a brave,
   a wise, an honest, and a useful body.'--Unhappily, when they passed
   away, they were followed by a generation of profligates, triflers, and
   sceptics; and their reputation has suffered accordingly in passing
   through prejudiced hands. But, judged with righteous judgment,' they
   will be found men of whom the world was not worthy. The more they are
   really known, the more they will be esteemed."

   Such was the school to which Manton undeniably belonged. Such is the
   truth about the Puritans. That they were not perfect and faultless, I
   freely admit. They said, did, and wrote many things which cannot be
   commended. Some of them, no doubt, were violent, fierce, narrow-minded
   sectarians; some were half-crazy fanatics and enthusiasts. Yet, even
   then, great allowance ought to be made for the trying circumstances in
   which they were often placed, and the incessant, irritating persecution
   to which they were exposed. And where is the great school of religious
   thought which is not often disgraced by some weaker members? With all
   their faults, the leaders of the party were great and good men. With
   all their defects, the Puritans, as a body, were not the men that some
   authors and writers in the present day are fond of representing them to
   have been. Those who disparage Manton because he was a Puritan, would
   do well to reconsider the ground they are taking up. They will find it
   utterly untenable. Facts, stern facts, are dead against them. They may
   not admire Puritanism in the abstract, but they will never give any
   proof that we ought not to admire, value, and study the writings of
   Puritan divines.

   I will now proceed to offer a brief estimate of Manton s merits. For
   convenience sake, we will examine him in four points of view--as a man,
   a writer, a theologian, and an expositor of Scripture. Under each of
   these heads the reader shall have my opinion of the man whose works are
   at length about to be put within reach of the public in a cheap and
   accessible form. I ask him to remember that I am no more infallible
   than the Pope; but I can truly say that my opinion is the result of an
   acquaintance with Manton's writings of at least twenty years' standing.

   1. As a man, I am disposed to assign a very high place to the author of
   these volumes. He strikes me as having been, not merely an ordinary
   "good" man, but one of singularly great grace and consistency of
   Christian character.

   He lived in an age when party spirit ran very high, and the faults of
   an adversary were carefully noted and relentlessly exposed. None,
   perhaps, found that out to their cost so thoroughly as the Puritans,
   after Charles II. returned to England, and the Commonwealth was
   overthrown. To blacken the reputation of a Puritan, and vilify him
   before the public, was too often the way to get promotion; and woe to
   the unhappy man whose life had given even a semblance of a handle to
   his opponents!

   In an age like this, Manton occupied for several years a very prominent
   position. He was not a country parson, living scores of miles from
   London, and absorbed in unobtrusive pastoral labours among a rural
   population. On the contrary, he was a standard-bearer in the fore-front
   of the battle--a city set upon a hill that could not be hid--a man who
   could neither say, nor do, nor write anything without being observed.
   Did Oliver Cromwell require a minister to offer up prayer at the public
   ceremony of his undertaking the Protectorship? Manton was the
   minister.--Did the Long Parliament want a special sermon preached
   before its members on that great public event? Manton was frequently
   ordered to be the preacher.--Did the famous Westminster Assembly want a
   commendatory preface written to their Confession and Catechisms of
   world-wide reputation? They commit the execution of it to the pen of
   Thomas Manton.--Was a Committee of Triers appointed to examine persons
   who were to be admitted into the ministry, or inducted into livings?
   Manton was a leading member of this committee.--Was a movement made by
   the Presbyterian divines, after Cromwell's death, to restore the
   monarchy and bring back Charles II.? Manton was a leader in the
   movement.--Was an effort made after the Restoration to bring about a
   reconciliation between the Episcopal Church and the Nonconformists?
   Manton was one of the commissioners to act in the matter in the unhappy
   Savoy Conference.--In short, if there was one name which more than
   another was incessantly before the public for several years about the
   period of the Restoration, that name was Manton's. If there was one
   divine who, willingly or unwillingly, was constantly standing under the
   full gaze of friends and foes in London, that divine was the Rector of
   St Paul's, Covent Garden, Thomas Manton.

   Now, remembering all this, I ask the reader to observe, that through
   out this fiery ordeal Manton preserved a spotless reputation. I am
   struck with the fact, that the most violent writers of that violent day
   can lay nothing to his charge of the slightest importance. The most
   foul-mouthed and rancorous assailants of the Puritans seem unable to
   lay hold on any weak point in his character. No weapon forged against
   him seems to prosper, and no dirt sticks to his name. Even Antony à
   Wood, the prejudiced author of "Athenae Oxonienses," can find nothing
   to allege against Manton, and is obliged to content himself with
   contemptible sneers and insinuations.

   Some one may perhaps imagine that Manton was a prudent, "canny" man,
   who avoided doing anything to give offence, and had a keen eye to his
   own interests. There is not an atom of foundation for such a theory.
   When it was first proposed to bring to trial and execute Charles I.,
   Manton was one of fifty-seven divines who signed and published a bold
   protest against the design. When Christopher Love was beheaded by
   Oliver Cromwell on a charge of treason, Manton accompanied him to the
   scaffold, and afterwards preached his funeral sermon at St Lawrence
   Jewry, though the soldiers threatened to shoot him. As to minding his
   own interests, no man perhaps ever thought less of them than Manton.
   The mere fact that he refused the Deanery of Rochester, when offered to
   him by Charles II., and afterwards resigned St Paul's, Covent Garden,
   for conscience sake, is plain evidence that he never shrank from giving
   offence if Christ's truth, in his judgment, seemed to make it
   necessary.

   With all these facts before us, I cannot avoid the conclusion that
   Manton must have been a man of uncommon graces and singular consistency
   of character. In no other way can I account for the comparative absence
   of material faults in his life, even his enemies themselves being
   judges. A man who went down to the grave at fifty-seven, with so fair a
   reputation, after spending the prime of his life in London, and
   mingling incessantly in public affairs, must surely have been no common
   Christian. It can never be said of him that his lines fell "in pleasant
   places," and that his grace was never tried and tested! Few modern
   divines perhaps ever passed through such a fiery ordeal as he did, and
   surely few ever came out of such with so untarnished a name. He must
   have been a rare combination of wisdom, tact, boldness, courtesy,
   firmness, sound judgment, and charity. As a godly man, I do not
   hesitate to place him in the foremost rank of Puritan divines; and I
   ask the student of his writings to remember, as they read them, that
   they are reading the works of one who was eminently a "good man, and
   full of the Holy Ghost."

   2. As a writer, I consider that Manton holds a somewhat peculiar place
   among the Puritan divines. He has pre-eminently a style of his own, and
   a style very unlike that of most of his school. I will try to explain
   what I mean.

   I do not regard him as a writer of striking power and brilliancy,
   compared to some of his cotemporaries. He never carries you by storm,
   and excites enthusiasm by passages of profound thought expressed in
   majestic language, such as you will find frequently in Charnock, and
   occasionally in Howe. He never rouses your inmost feelings, thrills
   your conscience, or stirs your heart of hearts, like Baxter. Such
   rhetoric as this was not Manton's gift, and the reader who expects to
   find it in his writings will be disappointed.

   I do not regard him as a writer of such genial imagination, and such
   talent for illustration and similitude, as several divines of his day.
   In this respect he is not to be compared with Brooks, and Watson, and
   Swinnock, and Adams. The pages of those worthy men are often like
   picture-galleries, in which the pictures are so thickly hung that you
   can hardly see the walls. Talent of this sort was certainly not in
   Manton's line. He paints his pictures and exhibits them, and they are
   always well sketched; but their number is comparatively small.

   Learning again does not stand out as conspicuously in Manton's writings
   as in the works of some of the Puritans. Judging by the list of
   quotations and references, you would say, that he had not so many
   authors at his fingers' end as Owen, or Caryl, or Jenkyns, or
   Arrowsmith, or Thomas Hall. Yet it is only fair to remember, that
   nearly all we possess of his works consists of sermons, and that a
   popular sermon is not the proper vehicle for an exhibition of learning.
   The great preacher will assimilate and digest the thoughts of other
   men, and make them his own, without incessantly confusing his hearers
   by reference to books. My own impression is that this was the case with
   Manton. I believe he was a great reader, and a very learned man, but
   that he had few opportunities of exhibiting his store of knowledge. In
   fact, reason and common sense point out that he could never have held
   the position he undoubtedly occupied as a London divine, and had such
   weight attached to his opinions, if he had not been a man of a
   well-furnished mind.

   Manton's chief excellence as a writer, in my judgment, consists in the
   ease, perspicuousness, and clearness of his style. He sees his subject
   clearly, expresses himself clearly, and seldom fails in making you see
   clearly what he means. He has a happy faculty of simplifying the point
   he handles. He never worries you with acres of long, ponderous,
   involved sentences, like Goodwin or Owen. His books, if not striking,
   are generally easy and pleasant reading, and destitute of anything
   harsh, cramped, obscure, and requiring a second glance to be
   understood. For my own part, I find it easier to read fifty pages of
   Manton's than ten of some of his brethren's; and after reading, I feel
   that I carry more away.

   Let no one, moreover, suppose that because Manton's style is easy, his
   writings show any lack of matter and thought. Nothing of the kind. The
   fertility of his mind seems to have been truly astonishing. Every page
   in his books contains many ideas, and gives you plenty to think about.
   No one, perhaps, but himself could have written such an immense book as
   he wrote on the 119th Psalm, and yet repeated himself so little, and
   preserved a freshness of tone to the end. The words of Dr Bates, no
   mean judge, are worth quoting on this point:--"I cannot but admire the
   fecundity and variety of his thoughts; that though the same things so
   often occur in the verses of this psalm, yet, by a judicious observing
   the different arguments and motives whereby the Psalmist expresses the
   same request, or some other circumstance, every sermon contains new
   conceptions proper to the text." This witness is true. If Manton never
   soars so high as some writers, he is, at any rate, never trifling,
   never shallow, never wearisome, and never dull. It was a striking
   remark of one of his cotemporaries, that "he had heard the greatest men
   of their day sometimes preach a mean sermon, but he had never heard Dr
   Manton do so on any occasion."

   I close this part of my essay by reminding the reader that Manton's
   writings, with few exceptions, were originally published under very
   great disadvantages. Most of them never saw the light till after his
   death, and were printed without receiving the author's last touches and
   corrections. This is a fact which ought not to be forgotten. None but
   an author knows what a vast difference there is between a work in
   manuscript and a work in type, and how many emendations and corrections
   are made in the best of literary productions, when the writer sees them
   in the shape of proofs. For my own part, when I take up a book of
   Manton's, and remind myself that it never received the author's final
   corrections, I am amazed that his writings contain so few blunders, and
   admire him more and more every time that I read him.

   3. As a theologian, I regard Manton as a divine of singularly
   well-balanced, well-proportioned, and scriptural views. He lived in a
   day when vague, indistinct, and indefinite statements of doctrine were
   not tolerated. The Christian Church was not regarded by any school as a
   kind of Pantheon, in which a man might believe and teach anything,
   everything, or nothing, so long as he was a clever and earnest man.
   Such views were reserved for our modern times. In the seventeenth
   century they were scorned and repudiated by every Church and sect in
   Christendom. In the seventeenth century, every divine who would achieve
   a reputation and obtain influence, was obliged to hold distinct and
   sharply-cut opinions. Earnestness alone was not thought sufficient to
   make a creed. Whether Episcopalian or Presbyterian, whether Conformist
   or Nonconformist, whether an admirer of Luther, or Calvin, or Arminius,
   every divine held certain distinct theological views. A vague,
   colourless, boneless, undogmatic Christianity, sup plying no clear
   comfort in life, and no clear hope in death, was a Christianity which
   found favour with none.

   Now, Manton was a Calvinist in his theology. He held the very doctrine
   which is so admirably set forth in the seventeenth Article of the
   Church of England. He held the same views which were held by
   nine-tenths of the English Reformers, and four-fifths of all the
   leading divines of the Church of England down to the accession of James
   I. He maintained and taught personal election, the perseverance of the
   saints, the absolute necessity of a regeneration evidenced by its
   fruits, as well as salvation by free grace, justification by faith
   alone, and the uselessness of ceremonial observances without true and
   vital religion. In all this there was nothing remarkable. He was only
   one among hundreds of good men in England who all taught these truths.
   But in Manton's Calvinism there was a curiously happy attention to the
   proportion of truth. He never exalts one doctrine at the expense of
   another. He gives to each doctrine that place and rank given to it in
   Scripture, neither more nor less, with a wisdom and felicity which I
   miss in some of the Puritan divines.

   Manton held strongly the doctrine of election. But that did not prevent
   him teaching that God loves all, and that His tender mercies are over
   all His works. He that wishes to see this truth set forth should read
   his sermon on the words, "God so loved the world that He gave His
   only-begotten Son" (John iii. 16), and mark how he speaks of the world.

   Manton held strongly the need of preventing and calling grace. But that
   did not hinder him from inviting all men to repent, believe, and be
   saved.

   Manton held strongly that faith alone lays hold on Christ, and
   appropriates justification. But that did not prevent him urging upon
   all the absolute necessity of repentance and turning from sin.

   Manton held strongly the perseverance of God's elect. But that did not
   hinder him from teaching that holiness is the grand distinguishing mark
   of God's people, and that he who talks of "never perishing," while he
   continues in wilful sin, is a hypocrite and a self-deceiver.

   In all this, I frankly confess, I see much to admire. I admire the
   scriptural wisdom of a man who, in a day of hard-and-fast systems could
   dare to be apparently inconsistent, in order to "declare all the
   counsel of God." I firmly believe that this is the test of theology,
   which does good in the Church of Christ. The man who is not tied hand
   and foot by systems, and does not pretend to reconcile what our
   imperfect eyesight cannot reconcile in this dispensation, he is the man
   whom God will bless. Manton was such a man; and because he was such a
   man, I think his works, like the "Pilgrim's Progress," deserve the
   attention of all true Christians.

   4. As an expositor of Scripture, I regard Manton with unmingled
   admiration. Here, at any rate, he is "facile princeps" among the
   divines of the Puritan school.

   The value of expository preaching is continually pressed on ministers
   in the present day, and not without reason. The end of all preaching is
   to bring men under the influence of God's Word; and nothing seems so
   likely to make men understand and value the Word as lectures in which
   the Word is explained. It was so in Chrysostom's days; it ought to be
   so again. The idea, no doubt, like every good theory, may be easily
   ridden to death; and I believe that with ignorant, semi-heathen
   congregations, a short pithy text often does more good than a long
   passage expounded. But I have no doubt of the immense value of
   expository preaching, when people will bring their Bibles to the
   service, and accompany the preacher as he travels on, or go home to
   their Bibles after the service, and compare what they have heard with
   the written Word.

   The readers of Manton's works will find in them a very large supply of
   expository sermons. Few, probably, are aware of the enormous quantity
   of exposition which his writings contain. They will find full and
   complete sets of sermons on Psalm cxix., on Isaiah liii., on Matthew
   xxv., on John xvii., on Romans vi., on Romans viii., and on 2
   Corinthians v.; besides regular commentaries on James and Jude. In all
   these works they will find every verse and every sentence explained,
   expounded, and enforced, plainly, clearly, and usefully, and far more
   fully than in most commentaries. Indeed, I defy any one to preach a
   sermon on any text in the above-mentioned chapters, and not to find
   some useful thoughts in Manton, if he will take the trouble to consult
   him.

   The value of these expository sermons, in my judgment, is very great
   indeed; and it is much to be regretted that hitherto they have been so
   little known. Of course they are not all of equal merit. Sometimes our
   author digresses, and wastes his time in discussing questions not
   necessarily belonging to the text. But, taking them for all in all, I
   unhesitatingly say that Manton's expository sermons are most valuable,
   and the re-publication of them in a portable form will prove a great
   blessing to the Church.

   The excellence of Manton's expository sermons, I think, lies in the
   following points. He generally sticks to the subject of each verse, and
   does not launch off into everything that may be said about each word.
   He generally gets over the ground with reasonable brevity, and does not
   weary the reader with an interminable flow of thought upon each
   expression. As an instance of what I mean, one single folio volume
   contains all his sermons on Matthew xxv., John xvii., Romans vi.,
   Romans viii., and 2 Corinthians v. In striking contrast with this,
   Jacomb on Romans viii. 1-4, occupies 622 4to pages; Hildersam on Psalm
   li. 1-7, fills 720 folio pages with 150 lectures; and Hardy on the 1st
   and 2d chapters of the 1st Epistle of John, takes up two 4to volumes
   and 1100 pages! Flesh and blood of ordinary mould cannot stand such
   lengthy work as this. I hold it to be a prime excellence of Manton's
   expository sermons that, while they are very full, they are never too
   long.

   For my own part, I am painfully struck with the general neglect with
   which these expository works of Manton's have been treated of late.
   Modern commentators who are very familiar with German commentaries seem
   hardly to know of the existence of Manton's expositions. Yet I venture
   boldly to say, that no student of the chapters I have named will ever
   fail to find new light thrown on their meaning by Manton. I rejoice to
   think that now at length these valuable works are about to become
   accessible to the general public. They have been too long buried, and
   it is high time they should be brought to light. I value their author
   most highly as a man, a writer, and a theologian; but if I must speak
   out all I think, there is no part in which I value him more than as a
   homiletical expositor of Scripture.

   It only remains for me to express my earnest hope that this new edition
   of Manton's works may prove acceptable to the public, and meet with
   many purchasers and readers. If any one wants to buy a good specimen of
   a Puritan divine, my advice unhesitatingly is, "Let him buy Manton."

   We have fallen upon evil days both for thinking and reading. Sermons
   which contain thought and matter are increasingly rare. The
   inexpressible shallownesss, thinness, and superficiality of many
   popular sermons in this day is something lamentable and appalling.
   Headers of real books appear to become fewer and fewer every year.
   Newspapers, and magazines, and periodicals seem to absorb the whole
   reading powers of the rising generation. What it will all end in God
   only knows. The prospect before us is sorrowful and humiliating.

   In days like these, I am thankful that the publishers of Manton's Works
   have boldly come forward to offer some real literary gold to the
   reading public. I earnestly trust that they will meet with the success
   which they deserve. If any recommendation of mine can help them in
   bringing out the writings of this admirable Puritan in a new form, I
   give it cheerfully and with all my heart.

   Vicar of Stradbroke, Suffolk.

THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

   To the Right Honourable ARTHUR, Earl of Anglesey.

   MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR,--In the learned ages of the world, it hath
   ever been somewhat difficult to suit books to the patronage of the
   learned, judicious, and impartial, such as they know you are who know
   you. And when such pieces are prepared, and ready to be sent abroad, it
   is not easy to make choice of a patron worthy of such a treatise. This
   presented to your lordship, worthy of a good, hath found out the best,
   patron; and like the incomparable History of Thuanus,' happy in its
   author and manner of writing, and in its patron to whom dedicated,
   fails only in the pen that dedicates it. The things it treateth of
   express much of your honour's sentiments, wishes, value, and endeavours
   to keep the root of Christianity flourishing, that Christians may
   answer their ancient character, vivimus, non loquimur, magna. It
   savoureth of that moderation which adorns the Christian; it does with
   candour represent things in which many now dissent, that it would be
   happy for the Church of Christ if all would, on such terms, forbear
   each other, bear one another's infirmities, and show that they believe
   the Lord is at hand.' Here, I think, is rightly stated what are the
   lesser, what are the weightier things of the law; and here are
   directions which, if followed, would keep peace and love among
   brethren, and perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. The author
   enjoys that sight which holiness and peace, here recommended, did lead
   him, and will lead others unto. He is en makari'tois, and reaps the
   fruit of those and other his labours, which were designed to help
   others to happiness also. Be pleased to give the publisher leave to
   send this into the world, countenanced with your honour's name and

THE PREFERENCE OF DUTIES:

MORALS BEFORE RITUALS.

   But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice.--Mat. IX. 13.

   THESE words are part of Christ's plea for his converse with publicans
   and sinners, at which the pharisees took offence.

   Three answers he maketh:--

   1. From their necessity, represented in a proverbial speech: The whole
   need not a physician, but they that are sick.'

   2. From the end of his commission: I came not,' as the doctor of the
   church, to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.'

   3. Here is a third, suggested in the words read to you, by a saying of
   the prophet Hosea, chap. vi. 6, where a general reason is intimated,
   that a ceremony of the Levitical law must not hinder a necessary duty
   of the moral law. Therefore his conversing with them for their
   edification was not unlawful nor uncomely, for all rituals must give
   way to morals; and so those laws of not accompanying with a heathen, or
   an unclean person, were never intended to be a bar to an act of mercy
   or charity, especially spiritual mercy and charity. And therefore,
   though they held the publicans profane, and unworthy their conversation
   (therein also stretching the law), yet Christ, without any breach of
   decorum, might converse with them for their good; for if acts of mercy
   and charity are to be preferred before the ceremonies of the worship of
   God, this act of rescuing and saving a soul is to be preferred before
   all these ritual restraints of conversation with those who were
   supposed to be unworthy or legally unclean. And it is notable, these
   words are brought, not only to vindicate this fact of Christ, but
   secretly to tax the pharisaical hypocrisy of those who place religion
   in rituals more than morals. Elsewhere you find Christ at this argument
   again on another occasion, but to the same end and purpose: Mat. xii.
   7. When the pharisees frowned because the disciples plucked ears of
   corn for their necessity on the Sabbath-day: If you had known what this
   meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have
   condemned the guiltless.' So that this one sentence is notably useful
   to condemn pharisaism, or, which is all one, close hypocrisy, and
   withal to set us right in the true religion.

   In the words observe:--

   1. Christ's preface.

   2. The words of the prophet quoted.

   Christ's preface is to be regarded: Go ye, learn what that meaneth.'
   And in the other place, If you had known what this meaneth.' This
   showeth that it is a point which deserveth well to be studied by us
   this saying of the Lord by the prophet, I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice.'

   Where observe:--

   1. The form is negative, but in the sense it is to be understood
   comparatively: I will have mercy rather than sacrifice.' So when Paul
   saith, 1 Cor. i. 17, Christ sent me, not to baptize, but to preach the
   gospel'--not chiefly to baptize, but rather to preach the gospel; so
   here it is not a simple negation, but a comparative, that he approved
   of moral duties more than sacrifice.

   2. Observe the two things compared--mercy and sacrifice. In the prophet
   Hosea there is another word, I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and the
   knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.' Mercy comprehendeth the
   duties of the second table, as the knowledge of God the duties of the
   first table. Now this piety towards God, and charity towards our
   neighbour, was more acceptable service towards God than all the rites
   of their external worship.

   Doct. There is much to be learned from God's expressing himself in his
   word that he liketh mercy to them that stand in need of it, better than
   the offering of the richest sacrifice.

   I frame the point so as it may comply with Christ's scope and purpose.

   Three things especially we learn in it:--

   I. The respective value and preference of duties.

   II. The guise of hypocrites, as our Saviour pincheth and taxeth the
   pharisees often by this point.

   III. The excellency of mercy.

   I. I shall speak to the respective value and preference of duties, and
   there I shall lay down these propositions.

   1. All that God commandeth must be respected, and obedience
   endeavoured, partly because his laws are all holy, just, and good: Rom.
   vii. 12, The law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and
   good'--viz., that law by which he was convinced, and which had brought
   such trouble in his heart; holy, as being the copy and draught of God's
   holiness; just, as doing no wrong, no infringement of our just freedom;
   good, as profitable to direct and perfect our operations--nothing
   therein is in vain or useless. And partly because they are all ratified
   by the same authority: Exod. xx. 1, God spake all these words,' not
   these words, but all these words: He that said, Thou shalt not commit
   adultery, said also, Thou shalt not steal;' as the apostle improveth
   the observation: James ii. 11, For he that said, Do not commit
   adultery, said also, Do not kill,' God hath expressed his will in one
   thing as well as another. And partly because in conversion we have
   grace given to obey all: Eph. iv. 24, The new man is created after God
   in righteousness and true holiness.' It is not only fitted for
   righteousness, but holiness; not only for holiness, but righteousness.
   As the sun is placed in heaven, that he may shed abroad his influence
   everywhere, and nothing is hidden from his heat and light, so is grace
   planted in the heart, that it may diffuse itself in a uniform
   obedience, and that we may be holy: 1 Pet. i. 15, As he that hath
   called us is holy, in all manner of conversation.' The heart is framed
   to resist every sin, and to observe all the commands of God. The new
   creature never cometh maimed out of the birth, or wanting any part.
   Well, then, holiness and righteousness must ever go together, and the
   obedience to both tables be inseparable. We must serve him in holiness
   and righteousness all our days,' Luke i.. 75; not in holiness only, or
   in righteousness only, but in both.

   2. Though all are to be respected, yet all duties are not equal, nor
   all sins equal. A vain thought is not so heinous a crime as the killing
   of a man; and to blaspheme and curse God is a greater sin than an idle
   word, and idolatry than stealing of a shilling. Though all God's laws
   stand by the same authority, yet the matter of all is not of a like
   moment and consequence. And therefore the sins and duties are greater
   and lesser, according to the importance of the law: Mat. v. 19,
   Whosoever shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall
   teach men so to do, shall be least in the kingdom of heaven.' There are
   commandments which may be called the least, and there are others which
   may be called the greatest--De ordine modum, the order showeth the
   weight. The fundamental article of the covenant is to have God for our
   God, and to prefer natural worship before instituted, the means stated
   before manner and time, God before man, parents before others.

   3. Simple duties of the first table are greater than duties of the
   second. Christ himself saith, Mat xxii. 38, that this is the first and
   great commandment.' They must needs be the greatest, because the object
   of them is greatest: God is greater than man,' as it is said, Job
   xxxiii. 12. To oppose a prince in person is more than to oppose his
   mean officer. He that sinneth against his neighbour sinneth against
   God, but not so immediately, 1 Cor. viii. 12. And 2dly, because this is
   the great bond on the heart to enforce the duty of the second, the
   conscience of our duty to God: because I love, or fear, or would honour
   God, therefore I perform my duty to man for the Lord's sake. And so we
   turn second table duties into first table duties; and so alms is a
   sacrifice, Heb. xiii. 16; and so obedience to masters is obedience to
   God, Eph. vi. 6. And as they enforce, so they regulate; for we are to
   obey them in the Lord, and so as will stand with a higher duty we owe
   to God: Acts iv. 19, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken
   unto you more than unto God, judge ye.' So that these are the greatest
   duties. But yet this must be understood so as the comparison be rightly
   made; the chief of the first table with the chief of the second, the
   middle with the middle, the least with the least, externals with
   externals; otherwise not. Disobedience to parents is more than an
   irreverent speech of God; adultery a greater sin than coldness in
   worship; stealing than not giving. The people made many prayers, but
   their hands were full of blood, Isa. i. 15. And therefore the order
   must be rightly conceived: first, love to God, then love to men; first,
   the worship of God, and then duty to men in our several relations;
   first, acts of outward worship, then acts of outward respects to men
   duties of piety, and also justice and charity. Thus the circumstantial
   and ceremonial duties of the first table must give place to the
   necessary and moral duties of the second. But when the comparison is
   duly made in the same rank, those laws which do simply and directly
   respect God are to be preferred before those duties which concern men;
   and sins of the highest degree against the first table are greater than
   sins of the highest degree against the second; and in duties, the love
   of our neighbour must give place to the love of God; as the love of
   father and mother, wife, children, friends, brethren: Luke xiv. 26, If
   any man hate not father and mother,' &c., he cannot be my disciple,'
   God is chief, and most worthy of respect.

   4. Moral and substantial duties should chiefly be made conscience of,
   and ought to take place of ceremonial observances, though belonging to
   the first table; for so in the text is mercy preferred before
   sacrifices. Which is to be regarded to a double end; partly, that we
   may not rest in them as the better part of our duty. If men submit
   never so much to external institutions about religion and worship, and
   think to satisfy their consciences therewith, yet they will not at all
   be accepted and approved of God. No. He looketh more to moral obedience
   than positive commands concerning the externals of religion. And
   therefore you have morals of the first table, or the second, often
   compared with, and preferred above the externals of religion; as 1 Sam.
   xv. 22, Hath the Lord any delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices? To
   obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
   Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness as idolatry.'
   It was spoken upon the occasion of Saul's sparing Agag, and the fat of
   the cattle for sacrifice, when he was to destroy man and beast. At
   other times it is compared with duties of the second table. The moral
   duties of the second table are better than the ceremonial duties of the
   first. If we be scanty in the one and abound in the other, it is a note
   of a hypocrite: Rom. xiv. 17, 18, The kingdom of God standeth not in
   meats and drinks, but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
   Ghost.' If a man do these things, he shall be accepted of the Lord, and
   approved of men. There are two expositions of that place, both equally
   probable; the one more general, that righteousness is taken for all new
   obedience, and peace for peace of conscience, resulting from the
   rectitude of our actions, and joy in the Holy Ghost for supernatural
   comfort, which the Holy Ghost puts into our hearts, by reflecting on
   our privileges by Christ, and the hopes of the world to come. Now,
   Christianity lieth not in outward observances, but in solid godliness.
   The other exposition is in a more limited sense; that by righteousness,
   is meant just dealing; by peace, a peaceable, harmless, inoffensive
   sort of living; by joy in the Holy Ghost, a delight to do good to one
   another, not dividing from, or hating, censuring, excommunicating one
   another for mere rituals, but pleasing one another to edification.
   These morals are more acceptable to God, and approved of men, than a
   furious zeal for lesser things, which belong to the ritual part, or
   external order of religion. It is an argument of a better spirit to be
   more zealous for morals and substantials than rituals; certainly
   without them we shall be of no account with God. And partly to [1]
   that, when moral duties come in competition with ceremonial, the moral
   duties at that time must take place of the other, and all positive
   commands concerning the externals of religion give way to them. The
   Lord never appointed the ceremonies of the first table to hinder works
   of mercy prescribed in the second; therefore the mercy must be done,
   and the sacrifice left undone: as the Sabbath is both broken and kept
   when there is an evident necessity of preserving the creature. When
   David fainted, it was a moral duty to relieve him, though there were no
   bread at hand but the shew-bread: 1 Sam. xxi. 4, There is no common
   bread under my hands.' And Christ urgeth that, Mat. xii. 3, 4, Have ye
   not read what David did when he was an hungered; how he entered into
   the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread, which was not lawful for
   him to eat, nor for them which were with him, but only for the
   priests?' In an extraordinary case of necessity, the shew-bread is as
   common bread. Now the reason is plain, because positives bind only in
   certain cases, but we are everlastingly obliged to things moral.
   Therefore externals must give way both to obedience and mercy. Internal
   acts of worship are never dispensed with.

   5. Sacrifices come under a double consideration, as they relate to
   Christ, the substance of them all, or as external performances rested
   in by that people.

   [1.] In the first consideration, their gospel lay much in sacrifices,
   and the main duties of godliness were exercised about them, as
   brokenness of heart: Ps. li. 17, The sacrifices of God are a broken
   spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, God, thou wilt not despise.' And
   faith in Christ, Heb. ix. 13, 14, For if the blood of bulls and goats,
   and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
   purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who
   through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge
   your consciences from dead works, to serve the living God?' And
   covenanting with God, Ps. 1. 5, Gather my saints together unto me,
   those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice;' and Rom. xii. 1,
   I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
   bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
   reasonable service.'

   [2.] In the second consideration, the outward bare offering, considered
   in itself, without faith and repentance, so God disclaimeth it: Isa. i.
   11, Bring no more vain oblations;' and Isa. lxvi. 2, 3, He that killeth
   an ox, is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut
   off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered
   swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol.'
   Their great confidence was in their sacrifices. God, therefore, showeth
   how loathsome these things were to him, without that disposition of
   soul which should accompany them; being such persons as those were, he
   would take no offering at their hands. The Lord in all ages is uniform
   and like himself, in approving and enjoining duty, and in disliking
   sin. Morals are always prized by him before externals, and an impartial
   respect to necessary duties was more to him than the greatest pomp of
   outward worship. It was so then, and it is so now. Pride, and malice,
   and envy, are greater evils than ceremonial uncleanness, and to fear
   God and work righteousness a greater duty than the best sacrifices. The
   performance of external duties is not, and never was, a sufficient
   testimony of true piety; nay, without the love of God and men, and a
   uniform obedience to his holy will, is mere hypocrisy.

   6. When the breach of a ceremonial precept bringeth with it the
   transgression of a moral precept, and is (without any absolute
   necessity) imposed in neglect and contempt of the law of God, then we
   are to run all hazards, rather than to transgress in the smallest
   externals; because though the matter enjoined be but small, yet the
   contempt of God is a great sin, and our sincerity and obedience to God
   is a great matter. As for instance, when Antiochus pressed the Jews to
   eat swine's flesh, which in case of great extremity no question they
   might do, yet when he pressed them out of contempt of the law, they
   chose rather to be tortured to death than to yield to it. And for this
   they are registered martyrs: Heb. xi. 35, They were tortured, not
   accepting deliverance, that they might receive a better resurrection.'
   There is a plain allusion to the story in the book of the Maccabees,
   concerning Eleazar, and the woman with her seven sons, so cruelly
   tortured. But these commands were contrary to the laws of God. Should
   they have said, God will have mercy, and not sacrifice'? No; in such a
   case God will have sacrifice, and not mercy. Though often advised to
   yield, they would not abate a jot of their zeal. For though the case be
   but in externals, yet there is a renunciation of our relation and
   obedience to God's law. So Daniel opening his windows, and praying
   three times a day, as he was wont to do, Dan. vi. 10. That circumstance
   might have been forborne, you will think, in a case of such imminent
   peril of life. No; he would neither forbear praying nor opening his
   windows; he had wont to do so before, and without dishonouring God and
   renouncing his profession, he could not forbear to do so now. The
   promise of audience, made to Solomon at the dedication of the temple,
   required this ceremony as an effect of faith: 1 Kings viii, 42, 43,
   When they shall pray towards this house, then hear thou in heaven.' And
   David saith, Ps. v. 7, In thy fear I will worship towards thy holy
   temple.' The temple did shadow forth the body of our Lord Christ, the
   mediator, in whom only our prayers and services are accepted with the
   Father, which Solomon respected in looking towards the temple. But the
   chief reason is, the necessity of profession, and open profession too,
   against this impious law, contrived by the malice of his enemies to
   make him afraid. Now, to show he was not frighted from his duty, he
   openeth his windows, and would not forego any circumstance of his duty
   to God. I might instance in circumcision (as urged by the false
   apostles), as necessary to our justification: Gal. v. 2-4, Behold, I
   Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
   nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
   is a debtor to do the whole law: Christ is become of none effect unto
   you. Whosoever of you are justified by the law, you are fallen from
   grace.' Such is the difference when God calleth us to the profession of
   a lesser truth. Therefore the case may be such that externals may bear
   great weight.

   7. If the externals of God's worship instituted by himself must give
   place to mercy, then externals of human institution ought much more to
   give place to mercy. Sacrifices were of God's institution, and a way of
   expressing their obedience and thankfulness in his worship; yet God
   saith, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.' And twice is this applied
   by Christ--to mercy towards the souls of men in the text, and mercy
   concerning the bodies of men, Mat. xii., to defend the disciples
   rubbing the ears of corn, because they fainted for hunger. Then by like
   reason, where the urging of externals may cross mercy to the souls of
   men, by depriving them of the means of edification, and the gifts of a
   lively ministry, or crossing mercy to the bodies of men, by depriving
   them and their families of their necessary support and maintenance, in
   such a case they should learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice.' And the peace and edification of the church is more
   valuable than that of a private man. In all external positive
   institutions, the apostles often urge charity to the souls of men, for
   which Christ died, that we neither wound them with sorrow or sin, as
   the sure rule to guide us, either in practising or forbearing our
   liberty: Rom. xiv. 15, Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ
   died.' So 1 Cor. viii. 11, And through thy knowledge shall the weak
   brother perish, for whom Christ died;' that is, the scandalous abuse of
   this knowledge. In short, if any great damage to the souls or bodies,
   scandal or inconvenience, should come upon urging these externals,
   surely they should be forborne; for if it be the will and pleasure of
   the King of kings and Lord of lords that matters commanded by his
   affirmative precepts should be forborne for charity's sake, men should
   be persuaded to remit of the rigour of their impositions in this kind,
   though the things imposed were indifferent, and the practice of them in
   some cases a duty; yet if it would destroy charity, we are to leave our
   prayers, public and private, forsake a sermon to save the life of our
   neighbour;. nay, to quench the fire burning his house; nay, to help his
   cattle out of the ditch. But I will prosecute this no further.

   Let me now make some use of what hath been said.

   1. Let us take heed that we be not of the number of them that are
   serious and zealous in some things, but not in all. Partial zeal hath
   always been the note of hypocrites; as the pharisees were earnest for
   externals, but neglected justice and charity. Saul is an instance of
   partial zeal in destroying the Gibeonites and sparing the Amalekites: 2
   Sam. xxi. 2, Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of
   Israel and Judah.' He was expressly commanded to root out the
   Amalekites, but he spared Agag out of seeming pity; but useth barbarous
   cruelty in seeking to root out the Gibeonites, who were to be preserved
   by oath and covenant; and this he is said to do in his zeal. Not a true
   zeal, surely, as aiming at God's glory; for it tended much to his
   dishonour to have them destroyed, who were new proselytes, and
   professing religion, and had put themselves under God's protection; but
   a preposterous hypocritical zeal, of aiming, as he pretended, at the
   welfare of the commonwealth of Israel: his main intent was popular
   applause, and to gratify them who envied the Gentiles should be
   incorporated into God's people. An hypocrite's conscience is not
   uniform, but brought upon the stage for a turn. I shall give you
   another instance in Jehu, mighty zealous in destroying the idolatry of
   Baal, which was the idolatry of the house of Ahab; but not only cold
   and indifferent, but resolute against the destroying the calves of Dan
   and Bethel, which was the idolatry of Jeroboam: 2 Kings x. 28, 29, Thus
   Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. Howbeit, from the sins of Jeroboam,
   wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from them, to wit,
   the golden calves in Dan and Bethel.' Reasons of state persuaded the
   one, and dissuaded the other. His interest lay in ruining the house of
   Ahab, and in taking care that the tribes might not revert to the house
   of David. Thus you see men zealous in some things may grievously sin in
   others. Therefore, my beloved, be you careful to regard all God's
   commands in their place; piety in its place, justice in its place,
   mercy in its place. The Jews, after they had smarted in Babylon, were
   zealous against idols, but robbed God of his dues, never took care to
   restore the riches of the temple. Therefore the apostle taxeth this
   partiality of zeal: Rom. ii. 22, Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou
   commit sacrilege?' The latter prophets tax them much for that crime.
   The Jewish form still is hatred of idolatry, insomuch that they think
   that all the plagues that come upon them is for the idolatry of their
   fathers, especially in the sin of the golden calf in the wilderness;
   and translate the scene of their repentance far enough from themselves,
   that they may not see their present sins, both in breaking the moral
   law and despising Christ. And every party is observed to have their
   form; one special commandment which they stick unto, which they are
   zealous for, whilst they neglect the rest. The reproaches of our
   enemies, saith the pharisee, are only for the fourth commandment, [2]
   but neglect the rest; zealous for the Sabbath, but unconscionable all
   the week after. Oh, let there be no occasion for this! Others seem to
   make little reckoning of other commandments, and insist only upon the
   fifth, obedience to superiors. The charge is sometimes carried between
   the third and sixth [3] commandment; they will not swear, but will lie,
   and slander their neighbours. I mention these things to show what need
   we have to be uniform in our obedience unto God.

   I will mention but one motive. They that do not obey all, will not long
   obey any, but where their interest or inclinations require it, will
   break all: as Herod did many things, but one command stuck with
   him--his Herodias, and that bringeth him to murder God's prophet, Mark
   vi. 20. One sin keepeth possession for Satan, and that one lust and
   corruption may undo all. A bird tied by the leg may make some show of
   escape; so do many think themselves at liberty, but the fowler hath
   them fast enough.

   2. Let us not rest in outward duties of worship, and place our zeal
   there, for that is an ill spirit that doth so, it is the badge of
   pharisaism: they keep a fair correspondence with God in the outward
   duties of his worship, but in other things deny then: subjection to
   him; the main reason is, because externals of worship are more easy
   than the denial of lusts. The sensual nature of man is such, that it is
   loth to be crossed, which produceth profaneness. Wherefore do men
   ingulf themselves in all manner of sensuality, but because they are
   loth to deny their natural appetites and desires, and to row against
   the stream of flesh and blood, and so to walk in the way of his own
   heart, and the sight of his eyes? Eccles. xi. 9. If nature must be
   crossed, it shall be crossed only for a little, and in some slight
   manner; they will give God some outward thing, which lieth remote from
   the subjection of the heart to him, therefore be zealous for externals;
   and this produceth hypocrisy, gross hypocrisy, and dissembling, whereby
   we deceive others, and get a good name among others, by a zeal and
   fervency for God's outward institutions. And this close hypocrisy or
   partiality of obedience, is that whereby we deceive ourselves,
   exceeding in external actions and duties, while we neglect those
   substantials wherein the heart and life of religion most lieth: such
   are the love of God, contempt of the world, mortification of the flesh,
   the heavenly mind and holy constitution of the soul, firmly set to
   please God in all things.

   Once more; that this deceit may be more strong, men are apt to exceed
   in outward observances, or by-laws of their own; and this produceth
   superstition, either negative, in condemning some outward things which
   God never condemned, as those ordinances of men which the apostle
   speaketh of, Col. ii. 21, Touch not, taste not, handle not;' or
   positive, in doing many things as duties, and crying them up as special
   acts and helps of religion, which God never instituted to that end and
   purpose: Mark vii. 7, 8, Teaching for doctrines the commandments of
   men.' The spirit and genius of superstition lieth in this--neglecting
   many things which God commandeth, but multi plying bonds and chains of
   their own making. Sacrifices enough! God shall have anything for the
   sin of their souls, Micah vi. 6, 7. Thus these three great evils,
   profaneness, hypocrisy, and superstition, do all grow upon the same
   stem and root. First, men must have an easy religion, where the flesh
   is not crossed, but no mortifying of lusts, no exercising ourselves to
   godliness. They can deny themselves in parting with a sacrifice, but
   the weighty things of piety, justice, and mercy are neglected. God
   shall have prayers enough, hearing enough, if the humour and temper of
   the body will suit with it. They can fast and gash themselves like
   Baal's priests; whip their bodies, but spare their sins; but the heart
   is not subdued to God. They can part with anything better than their
   lusts, and disturb the present ease of the body, by attending on long
   and tedious duties, rather than any solid and serious piety.

   II. The next lesson which we learn is, the guise of hypocrites; for our
   Lord intimateth that these pharisees had great need to learn the
   importance of that truth, as being extremely faulty: I will have mercy,
   and not sacrifice.'

   1. The first thing notable in hypocrites is a partial zeal; they have
   not an uniform conscience; are very exact in some things, but
   exceedingly defective and faulty in others. The good conscience is
   entire and universal: Heb. xiii. 18, We trust that we have a good
   conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.' The sincere
   purpose and intention of his heart was to direct his life according to
   the will of God in all things. Though every one hath his failings, yet
   the will and constant endeavour of a sincere heart is to govern himself
   universally according to the will of God in all points of duty, whether
   they concern God or man: as it is said of Zachary and Elizabeth, Luke
   i. 6, That they walked in all the ordinances and commandments of the
   Lord blameless.' The renewed conscience doth approve all; and the
   renewed will, which is the imperial power in the soul, the first mover
   and principle of all moral actions, is bent and inclined to obey all;
   and the new life is spent in striving to comply with all. But it is not
   so with hypocrites. They pick and choose out the easiest part in
   religion, and lay out all their zeal there, but let other things go: in
   some duties that are of easy digestion, and nourish their disease
   rather than cure their soul, none so zealous as they, none so partial
   as they. Now, a partial zeal for small things, with a plain neglect of
   the rest, is direct pharisaism; all for sacrifice, nothing for mercy.
   Therefore every one of us should take heed of halving and dividing with
   God: if we make conscience of piety, let us also make conscience of
   justice; if of justice, let us also make conscience of mercy. It is
   harder to renounce one sin wherein we delight, than a greater which we
   do not equally affect. A man is wedded to some special lusts, and is
   loth to hear of a divorce from them. We have our tender and sore places
   in the conscience, which we are loth should be touched. But if we be
   sincere with God we will keep ourselves from all, even from our own
   iniquity, Ps. xviii. 23; such as is most incident to us by temper, or
   custom of life, or course of our interests. To baulk or break with God,
   out of private reasons of pleasure, honour, or profit, or any corrupt
   interest, is to prefer these things before God, and to set up another
   chief good in our hearts, and to prefer it before his favour. Thus in
   general.

   2. They place all their godliness and righteousness in outward
   observances or external discipline, and so their religion is more in
   the flesh and in the letter than in heart and spirit; as the pharisees
   rested in outward worship only, or some external rules, without the
   inward and real duties either of the first or second table. Mat. xxiii.
   25, they cleanse the outside of the cup and platter, but within they
   are full of extortion and excess;' and ver. 28, Ye appear outwardly
   righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.'
   And everywhere they are represented as painted tombs without, but had
   much hidden uncleanness and corruption within. There was an outward
   formality and show of religion, when they denied the power thereof.
   They should join obedience to God and love to their neighbour with
   their outward sacrifices; but these things were of little value and
   esteem with them. Now, what sacrifices were to them, that external
   ordinances are to us; and what their rituals were, the same is the mode
   and garb of profession among us. And, therefore, external profession,
   or the performance of external duties according to our way, is not a
   sufficient testimony of true godliness. For .Christ saith, Mat. v. 20,
   Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
   pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Their
   righteousness was an outside righteousness, without that inward
   constitution of soul which doth belong to a renewed heart, and yet
   carried on in such a way, and applauded by men, that the Jews had a
   saying, That if but two men out of all the world went to heaven, the
   one should be a scribe and the other a pharisee. O Christians! it is
   one thing to approve ourselves to God, who searcheth the heart, and
   another thing to approve ourselves to men, who look only to the outside
   and fair appearance without. A renewed heart, that is unfeignedly set
   to please God in all things, is more than all the pomp of external
   duties. And, therefore, we should study to give evidence of this by
   making conscience of obedience, as well inwardly as outwardly, growing
   in holiness all the days of our lives. This will be comfortable to us,
   and this will be approved of God hereafter, even such an holiness as is
   manifested in all the parts of our conversation, in outward carriage
   and secret practice, common affairs, and religious duties; in the
   worship of God, and charity and justice to men: Phil. iii. 3, We are
   the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and have no
   confidence in the flesh.' When there is a serious bent, and the true
   spiritual affections of a renewed heart towards God and man, and we do
   not rest in outward duties, but are still growing in internal grace,
   faith, hope, and love, and are still purifying the heart and life, that
   we may constantly glorify God, and do good to men, this is that which
   is over and above the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees: our
   duty is to serve God in the spirit, and to bring the inward man in
   subjection to him, without which externals are of little worth.

   3. They were more in love with ceremonies than with substance.
   Sacrifices, which belonged to the ceremonies of the law, were in high
   esteem with them; but godliness, justice, and mercy were of little
   regard. And as outward things were preferred before inward, so the
   lesser things before the weighty: as to their duties, tithing mint, and
   anise, and cummin; but they have omitted the weightier matters of the
   law, justice, mercy, faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to
   leave the other undone,' Mat. xxiii. 23. Formality and hypocrisy maketh
   men wise about that which is least to purpose. They make a business
   about ceremonies, but neglect the substance of religion. They enlarged
   their phylacteries, which were scrolls of parchment on which the law
   was written, but took no care of having the law of God written upon
   their hearts. Hypocrisy is an odd, trifling zeal, which runneth out
   upon little things. So for avoiding sin, Mat. xxiii. 24, They strain at
   a gnat, and swallow a camel.' More scrupulous in a little sin than a
   great; in small sins very scrupulous, in greater matters very
   adventurous. And because this is one of the main things here intended,
   I shall give you instances and reasons.

   [1.] Instances to prove that hypocrites have such an odd conscience
   that straineth greatly at a small thing. We have them every where out
   of the word of God. Herod's making conscience of his oath, but not of
   shedding innocent blood: The king was sorry: nevertheless, for his
   oath's sake,' &c., Mat. xiv. 9, he caused John the Baptist to be
   beheaded. A sinner is holden in bonds which he might lawfully break;
   rather than Herod will break his rash oath John shall lose his head. Of
   such an odd complexion is the conscience of carnal men. So the Jews,
   when Judas laid down the hire of his treason, and cast the money at
   their feet, Mat. xxvii. 6, 7, It is not lawful,' said they, to put it
   into the treasury, because it is the price of blood;' pretending to be
   afraid to offend in the least things, when they had offended in the
   greater. They boggled not at betraying innocent blood, and yet they
   would not meddle with the gain when it was thrown back to them. Another
   instance of the like conscience is John xviii. 28, Then led they Jesus
   from Caiaphas unto the judgment-hall, and it was early; and they
   themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be
   defiled, but that they might eat the passover.' They were careful to
   avoid legal pollution, and yet they were at the same time seeking the
   life of the Lord of glory. Just such another fit of conscience cometh
   upon them a little after: John xix. 31, They went to Pilate, and
   desired that the bodies might not hang upon the cross on the
   Sabbath-day, lest their great feast should be defiled. And thus you see
   that through formality and custom men may be strictly bound in
   conscience to perform the duties of ceremonial or external worship,
   whose consciences notwithstanding never scruple to violate the most
   weighty precepts of the law. Just of this nature was that solemn case
   of conscience, Zech. vii. 1, 2, about the keeping of their fasts, when
   the prophet telleth them they had higher matters to mind, the executing
   of judgment and showing mercy, and breaking off their oppressions, ver.
   10. The Lord would not answer their cases about the fasts, some of
   which were needless and superfluous; but would have them break off
   their known sins. Hitherto may be reduced the harlot in the Proverbs,
   that enticed the young man to adultery, and yet she had her
   peace-offerings: I have peace-offerings with me this day,' Prov. vii.
   14, with the 18th; made conscience of her sacrifices, but not of her
   honesty and chastity. Yea, also, we may reckon to this rank of
   conscience the instance of Bathsheba. Even the children of God have
   much hypocrisy, and an odd kind of conscience, when they give way to
   wilful and heinous sin. The passage is, 2 Sam. xi. 4, David took her,
   and committed adultery with her, for she was purified from her
   uncleanness.' That uncleanness was ceremonial only; but in the meantime
   she was committing a moral uncleanness, from which she was not so
   careful to keep herself. Well, then, the consciences of men being of
   such a make, well might God say, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice;'
   substance, and not ceremony. And we have all need to take heed to
   ourselves that we do not boggle and startle at a shadow, when in the
   meantime we are stupid and senseless in sins of another nature and
   deeper dye, and preserve a tenderness in lesser things, when we give
   way to injustice and oppression.

   [2.] The reasons why hypocrites never find their consciences awake so
   much as in matters ceremonial. I shall give these two:--

   First, Because these are of easiest digestion, and will sooner satisfy
   the conscience. Slight duties suit best with a heart that is unwilling
   to come under the power of religion. Conscience is like the stomach,
   which naturally desireth to fill itself; and when it cannot digest
   solid food, it sucketh nothing but wind. They that place their
   confidence in their own righteousness, presently fly to their external
   shows. The right stating of the duties of the law, according to their
   due weight, would convince them of their mistake. Therefore, that the
   ell may be no longer than the cloth, they confine their obedience to
   external observations, and so make their religion as commodious for
   themselves as they can. Adultery is nothing to eating flesh in Lent, or
   breaking some external rule. The apostle saith, Going about to
   establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the
   righteousness of God,' Rom. x. 3. Not to the way of solid righteousness
   and broken-hearted acceptance of Christ, but an external appearance of
   duty is most for their interest.

   Secondly, To put the better pretence upon their vile practices,
   therefore they must have some external ceremonies to countenance them.
   Thus the pharisees, to countenance their oppressions, for a pretence
   make long prayers,' Mat. xxiii. 14. That made them be trusted by the
   destitute widows, whom they deceived. As Jezebel would have the
   formality of a fast, for the better colour of her impiety in destroying
   Naboth. In days of fasts, they were wont to inquire after heinous
   offenders, to execute the law upon them, as you may see Num. xv. 7, 8,
   and Ps. cvi. 30, so to stop God's wrath. So some expound that, Joel i.
   14, Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders;' that
   is, call a court who may inquire into offenders, that they may be
   punished and reformed. So Jezebel calls a fast, for the better pretence
   of a court to take cognisance of Naboth's sin.

   4. They make conscience, not only of externals instituted by God, but
   mostly of those that are devised by themselves. This very abstinence
   from converse with publicans was a thing not forbidden by the law, but
   an institution of their own; because of their frequent converse with
   heathens, they looked upon them as a polluted sort of men, and unworthy
   of their converse. So that this helpeth us to another character of
   hypocrites; they are zealous for human traditions, but transgressors of
   divine commands; God's precepts are little regarded; and so prefer
   their own institutions before the laws of God. So Mat. xv. 3, By your
   traditions ye transgress the commands of God;' namely, by holding that
   if a man had devoted his estate to God, he might choose whether he
   would relieve his parents. Men are mightily in love with their own
   customs, and place much religion in man's injunctions, and care not how
   they loosen or weaken the obligation of God's law by their impositions.
   The pharisees' great fault was, they would outdo the law in externals;
   and then, when they had set their post by God's post, they were more
   zealous for man's inventions than for God's ordinances; and this zeal
   is shown either by imposing upon themselves or others imposing upon
   their own consciences when they lie in chains of their own making; on
   others when they make their own practice the rule of others: Mat. ix.
   14, The pharisees fast, John's disciples fast, thy disciples fast not.'
   To this head we may reduce Saul's rash restraining the people by his
   injunction and oath, 1 Sam. xiv. 32, with ver. 38. The people had
   gotten a great victory, and Saul, out of his hypocritical zeal,
   commandeth them to fast till evening. Now what was the issue? The
   people, through faintness, could not pursue the enemy; Jonathan, that
   heard nothing of this curse and oath, was in danger of his life; and
   the people, being hunger-starved, for greediness did eat the flesh and
   the blood together, contrary to God's law, Gen. ix. 4; Lev. xvii. 13,
   14. Mark there: though hunger could not force to transgress Saul's
   commandment for fear of death, yet it forced them to break God's
   express commandment in eating the blood, which was so expressly
   forbidden. And at night, when God answered him not, Saul thought
   somewhat was in the matter; he goeth to cast lots, and the lot had
   found out Jonathan. Saul never thinketh of the breach of God's
   law--first by himself, in imposing a rash and sinful oath; or of the
   people's sin, in eating the blood with the flesh; and presumeth it must
   needs be the breach of that oath which he had imposed; and so, like a
   hypocrite, preferreth his own groundless command before the law of God,
   and of punishing this with rigour when the other is never spoken of. I
   have brought this story to show you how zealous men are for their own
   impositions on themselves and others, and how easily they can dispense
   with God's laws to comply with their own; and how drunkenness,
   whoredom, and fornication do not seem such odious crimes as violating
   man's customs and institutions and private rules of their own.

   5. Hypocrites have a conceit of their own righteousness, and a disdain
   of others. This was the very case in the text; they were angry because
   Christ entered into the house of Matthew, a publican, and did eat meat
   there, though he had converted him. And elsewhere it is made the
   characteristic note of the pharisees Luke xviii. 9, They trusted in
   themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.' Men that fly
   to externals are soon puffed up, and nothing humbleth so much as a
   sound sense of religion; and a solemn exercising ourselves to godliness
   maketh us see and loathe ourselves and pity others. I find the
   pharisees enemies ever to the freeness of God's grace to sinners and
   the work of repentance, and that the bringing of poor sinners to
   salvation was the great eyesore. They call Christ a wine-bibber and a
   friend of publicans and sinners, because of his social and free, but
   sanctified, converse with all sorts of men, Mat. xi. 18. He would not
   take such a strict form as John did, because he would not seem to
   justify their pharisaical rigours. So again, Luke xv. 2, This man
   receiveth sinners, and eateth with them;' because he went to them as a
   physician to heal their souls. Christ refused not familiarity with the
   poorest and worst, as was needful for their cure, and would not observe
   the humour of proud pharisaical separation, by the parables of the lost
   sheep and the lost groat, but confuteth it; showeth that this is the
   spirit of the elder brother who envied the prodigal's return; and
   telleth them in another place that Publicans and harlots enter into the
   kingdom of heaven before them,' Mat. xxi. 31; pleadeth the cause of the
   woman against Simon the pharisee, Luke vii. 39. If this man had been a
   prophet, he would have known who and what manner of woman this is that
   touched him,' Luke vii. 47: Christ telleth him, She had much for given
   her, for she loved much.' Well, then, a penitent, broken hearted sense
   of our own being indebted to grace, and tender compassion towards
   others that yet go astray, discovereth the true spirit of the gospel.
   But to stand aloof from others by a foolish singularity, Isa. lxv. 5,
   which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than
   thou.' Some, though impure and profane, counted all others unholy and
   unclean but themselves. This inclosing spirit is the spirit of
   pharisaism; an outside strictness, without that faith, love, charity,
   meekness, usefulness, and humility, which is the very soul and life of
   Christianity. Usually gifts and outward strictness puff up men with a
   vain conceit of their own righteousness, and a censuring and despising
   others. This one text showeth us both the spirit of pharisaism and the
   spirit of Christianity. The pharisees, who abounded in external
   observances, censured Christ for his free converse, disdained these
   penitent people whom he invited to a better life. But now true religion
   maketh men humble and lowly in their own eyes, by acquainting them with
   the desert of sin and their own misery, and maketh men pitiful and
   compassionate towards others, more ready to help than to censure them,
   and to use all ways and means to do them good. But when men would shine
   alone in the repute of holiness, they are envious to those who
   penitently return to their duty, as those servants who had wrought all
   the day envied those that came in at the last hour, Mat. xx. 12, or as
   the elder brother envied the prodigal, or Simon the pharisee repined at
   Mary Magdalene's [4] observance of Christ. They esteem much of their
   own works, merits, sufferings, and righteousness. Oh, take heed of this
   spirit!

   [1.] The use of this branch is to press us to regard internals more
   than externals, and the substantial s more than the ceremonials of
   worship, and a broken-hearted, thankful sense of our Redeemer's love
   before a legal righteousness. Inward worship is love, fear, and trust;
   outward worship is prayer, praise, hearing, reading. Outward worship is
   not a duty at all times, but inward worship is a duty at all times; for
   we should always love God, and delight in God, and trust in God.
   Outward worship may be omitted for a work of mercy, and in case of
   invincible necessities; but inward worship may never be omitted, never
   dispensed with. We always owe love and renewed obedience to God, and
   must depend upon him and delight in him. Outward worship may be
   counterfeited; and external worship, without holiness, is highly
   displeasing to God, and never pleasing but when it is in conjunction
   with it. Hypocrites may abound in externals, but hypocrites will not
   delight themselves in the Lord, nor heartily devote themselves to him,
   so as to serve, please, and glorify him: the inward graces cannot be
   counterfeited, but the outward expression may.

   [2.] Be more careful of the substantiate than of the ceremonials of
   religion, and to mind the power of godliness more than the form. The
   substantiate of religion are the love of God and our neighbour. The
   circumstantiate are those ways of worship which God hath appointed,
   whereby we are visibly to express our love to him. Now, our main care
   should be, in the first place, to be entirely devoted and subject to
   God. That was Job's character, one that feared God and eschewed evil,'
   Job i. 11. To do that we do out of love to him; obeying his laws as our
   rule, and depending upon his rewards as our happiness. And as to men,
   let us be faithful, and walk holily in our places, callings, and
   relations, being just and kind unto all, but having an exceeding dear
   love for our fellow-saints and everlasting companions. This is more
   pleasing to God than the costliest sacrifices, than all our flocks and
   herds, or any outward thing that we do for him. I take notice of those
   words of God to Solomon, when he was building him a magnificent temple,
   1 Kings vi. 11, 12, And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
   Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my
   statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
   walk in them, then will I perform my word to thee, which I spake to
   David thy father.' God hath more respect to Solomon's faithful
   obedience than to that glorious building. So far do morals exceed
   ceremonials in religion.

   [3.] That you prefer a broken-hearted, thankful sense of our Redeemer's
   love, before legal and conceited righteousness of our own. Christ's
   love to sinners is that which the pharisees mainly stumbled at. An
   external show and fair pretence of a good life, which had no bottom of
   regeneration, was the superficial righteousness of the pharisees.
   Nicodemus, who had been of that sect, wondered when that was pressed
   upon him, John iii. 4, 5. An outward conformity, which was more in show
   than in substance, in form and fashion than in power, was their
   religion; abstaining from gross sins, as murder and adultery, but not
   purifying the heart from lusts. Murder they made conscience of, but not
   of envy, malice, and hatred; theft, but not covetousness and close
   extortion; adultery, but not wantonness or looking upon a woman to lust
   after her, as you may see at large, Mat. v. Thus Christ presseth us to
   exceed the pharisees, who turned all obedience into an empty formality,
   wherein they puffed up themselves as mere men, and so had never been at
   the market of free grace. All their wares were their own, and their
   righteousness of their own spinning, and therein stood upon their own
   bottom, without seeking the reconciling and renewing grace of the
   Redeemer: Luke xviii., The proud pharisee pleadeth his own merits
   rather than God's grace, but the publican pleaded mercy. It was long
   ere Paul was brought to count all but dung and dross for the excellency
   of the knowledge of Christ, Phil. iii. 7-9. But on the other side, a
   Christian, though he maketh progress in holiness, yet, from first to
   last, cherisheth a broken-hearted sense of his own wants, and a
   thankful remembrance of his Redeemer's love, who is all in all with
   him, both for justification and sanctification. Before pardon, the
   sinner is weakened and humbled with a sense of his lost condition, and
   then there is a constant watchfulness, with repentance and brokenness
   of heart, which followeth pardon; loving much, because much is
   forgiven,' Luke vii. 47; and loathing himself, in his own sight, be
   cause of his vileness and sinfulness, after God is reconciled to him,
   Ezek. xvi. 63. This is the frame of heart which suiteth with the gospel
   state.

   III. I come to the third thing--the value of mercy. I shall not speak
   of it at large, but only with respect to this scripture.

   1. It is better than sacrifice. To sacrifice is to serve God, but to
   show mercy is to be like God: Luke vi. 36, Be ye therefore merciful, as
   your heavenly Father is merciful.' Now, conformity to God is more noble
   than subjection to God; it hath more of perfection and blessedness in
   it especially, than a particular external mode and way of subjection to
   God.

   2. As it is preferred before sacrifice, so it is preferred before the
   external observation of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is the great
   institution conducing to the enlivening of other duties; mercy, not
   only to the souls of men as here, or bodies of men, but mercy to the
   bodies of the beasts: to help a beast out of a pit is a Sabbath-day's
   work, Mat. xii. 11, 12.

   3. It is more than gospel externals of worship. The apostle had spoken
   of being not hearers of the word only, but doers also,' James i. 22.
   Then saith, verse 27, Pure religion, and undefiled before God, is this,
   to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and keep
   himself unspotted from the world.' Is this religion, to come to church,
   to hear the strictest preachers? Doth the apostle reckon this another
   part of religion? No; but to visit the fatherless and widows.' They who
   are truly religious have such a deep sense of God's mercy to them that
   they are changed into the divine nature, that they cannot but pity the
   miserable and afflicted. Now, the ordinances of the gospel are
   rational, not so carnal and servile as the ordinances under the law.

   4. It is more excellent than all the gifts of the gospel. The gifts of
   the gospel were glorious things--gifts of tongues, gifts of healing,
   gifts of knowledge and utterance: 1 Cor. xii. 31, Covet earnestly the
   best gifts; and yet I show you a more excellent way.' What is that?
   Love, charity, mercy. Though abilities are excellent things, to be able
   to edify and instruct others, yet no way to be compared with the grace
   of charity, and the performing all our duties to our brethren out of
   love to God.

   5. I cannot say it is above the graces of the gospel--faith and love to
   God; yet this I can say, that those graces are not real unless
   accompanied with charity: 1 John iv. 20, If a man say he loveth God,
   and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for if a man hateth his brother
   whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' He
   speaketh there of love to Christ, ver. 19, We love him because he loved
   us first.' There may be a great deal of hypocrisy in professing and
   pretending love to Christ; and so he doth, certainly, who doth malign
   and persecute Christians, or not show mercy to them in their
   distresses. We daily converse with men, meet with objects of charity,
   whom we should pity; but if we do not this, which is the more easy, we
   will not do that which is more difficult.

   6. It is the qualification of finding mercy: Mat. v. 7, Blessed are the
   merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' Compassion to other men's
   bodies and souls gives this hope and confidence of finding mercy with
   the Lord, and that is all our hope.

   It will be inquired into at the day of judgment: Mat. xxv. 35-41, For I
   was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
   drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I
   was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then
   shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
   hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we
   thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked and clothed thee? Or when
   saw we thee sick or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall
   answer and say unto them, Verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have
   done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
   unto me. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
   me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
   angels.'

   Oh, then, let us make conscience of this duty more than ever we have
   done.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUE CIRCUMCISION.

   For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
   rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.--Phil.
   III. 3.

   AMONG those that entertain thoughts of religion there ever have been
   and will be many contests who are the true church and people of God.
   The lazy place their plea and claim in external observations; the
   serious look to the vitals and heart of religion, and cannot satisfy
   themselves in an outward form without the life and power. This was the
   very difference between the true Christians and a certain sort of
   persons who took upon them to be the circumcision. The Jews are often
   called the circumcision,' therefore Christ is said to be a minister of
   the circumcision,' as being sent to the people that were to be
   circumcised, Rom. xv. 8. And Peter is called the apostle of the
   circumcision,' Gal. ii. 7, 8, as being appointed to deal with that
   people. Now these Judaizing Christians, who had a zeal for the
   ceremonies of the law, did falsely boast themselves to be the only
   people of God and the true circumcision. This was the difference
   between them: who were to be accounted the true circumcision, the
   Jewish zealots, who placed their justification in the ceremonies of the
   law, or those who adhered to Christ only, and looked for the mercy of
   God through him? We are the circumcision' say they, excluding the other
   and better sort of Christians. The one had the form, and the other the
   effect and power; the one were circumcised outwardly, the other
   spiritually. The apostle judgeth for the latter; the former were
   katatome`, the concision,' who, instead of circumcising themselves, did
   cut asunder the church of God; but the sound believers were peritome`,
   the circumcision' indeed, as being circumcised by the circumcision made
   without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by
   Christ, Col. ii. 11. They were the true children of Abraham, who did
   indeed perform that for which circumcision was intended, for we are the
   circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ
   Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.'

   In the words we have a threefold description of the true circumcision:
   how they stand affected to God, Christ, self.

   I. They worship God in the spirit.

   II. They rejoice in Christ Jesus.

   III. They have no confidence in the flesh.

   I. They worship God in the spirit. This clause may be interpreted:--

   1. In opposition to the legal ordinances. So it is taken, John iv. 23,
   24, But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
   worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such
   to worship him. God is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship
   him in spirit and in truth.' The Jewish worship is in a sense called
   carnal, the Christian spiritual: Heb. vii. 16, A carnal commandment;'
   Heb. ix. 10, Carnal ordinances imposed on them till the time of
   reformation;' and shadows,' Heb. x. 1. Now the Lord would have a
   spiritual worship, and the truth of what was in these shadows, these
   external forms, he allowed (instituted in the infancy of the church),
   so that they worship God in the spirit' is, they have embraced the true
   worship of the gospel, and serve God, not by the carnal rites of the
   law, but by the pure rational worship of the gospel. This is part of
   the sense.

   2. It implieth worshipping God with the inward and spiritual affections
   of a renewed heart: Heb. xii. 28, Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom
   which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God
   acceptably with reverence and godly fear.' Worship flowing from grace,
   engaging the heart in God's service, is that which God prizeth;
   therefore a Christian should not rest in an external form: God is nay
   witness, whom I serve with my spirit,' Rom. i. 9.

   3. It doth also imply the assistance and continual influence of the
   Holy Spirit: Eph. vi. 18, Praying always with all prayer and
   supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
   perseverance and supplication for all saints;' and Jude, ver. 20,
   Praying in the Holy Ghost.'

   The doctrine is this: That a true Christian is known by his worship, or
   is one that doth worship God in the spirit.

   Here I shall show you:--

   1. What is worship.

   2. Why a true Christian--(1.) doth worship; (2.) why in the spirit.

   1. What is worship? It is either internal or external. The internal
   consisteth in the love and reverence we owe to God; the external in
   those offices and duties by which our honour and respect to God is
   signified and expressed.

   [1.] Internal. The soul and life of our worship lieth in faith, and
   reverence, and delight in God above all other things: Ps. ii. 11, Serve
   the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling;' such a delight as will
   become the greatness and goodness of God. Worship hath its rise and
   foundation in the heart of the worshipper; there it must begin. In our
   high thoughts and esteem of God especially two things--love and trust.

   (1.) Love: Deut. vi. 5, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.' We worship God when
   we give him such a love as is superlative and transcendental, far above
   the love that we give to any other thing, that so our respect to other
   things may stoop and give way to our respect to God.

   (2.) The other affection whereby we express our esteem of God is trust,
   which is the other foundation of worship: Ps. lxii. 8, Trust in the
   Lord at all times, pour out your hearts before him.' Delightful
   adhesion to God, and an entire dependence upon him; if either fail or
   be intermitted, our worship faileth. If delight: Job xxvii. 10, Will he
   delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?' Isa.
   xliii. 22, But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast
   been weary of me, O Israel.' They that love God and delight in him
   cannot be long out of his company; they take all opportunities and
   occasions of being with God. So dependence and trust: Heb. iii. 12,
   Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
   unbelief, in departing from the living God;' James i. 6, 7, Let him ask
   in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the
   sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that
   he shall receive anything of the Lord.' Dependence begets observance:
   they that distrust God's promises will not long keep his precepts. If
   we look for all from him, we will often come to him and take all out of
   his hands, be careful that we do not offend him and displease him.

   [2.] External. In those offices and duties by which our honour and
   respect to God is signified and expressed--as by invocation,
   thanksgiving, praise, obedience. God will be owned both in heart and
   life, in all these prescribed duties by which our affections towards
   him are acted. If God did not call for outward worship, why did he
   appoint the ordinances of preaching, praying, singing psalms, baptism,
   and the Lord's Supper? God, that made the whole man, body and soul,
   must be worshipped of the whole man; therefore, besides the inward
   affections, there must be external actions; in short, we are said to
   worship God either with respect to the duties which are more directly
   to be performed to God, or in our whole conversation.

   (1.) With respect to the duties which imply our solemn converse with
   God, and are more directly to be performed towards him--such as the
   word, prayer, praise, thanksgiving, and sacraments--surely these must
   be attended upon, because they are special acts of love to God and
   trust in him. And these duties are the ways wherein God hath promised
   to meet with his people, and appointed us to expect his grace: Exod.
   xx. 24, In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and
   bless thee;' and Mark iv. 24, it is a rule of commerce between us and
   God, With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto
   you that hear shall more be given.'

   (2.) In our whole conversation: Luke i. 74, 75, That we should serve
   him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the
   days of our lives.' A Christian's life is a constant hymn to God, or a
   continued act of worship; ever behaving himself as in the sight of God,
   and directing all things as to his glory. He turneth second table
   duties into first: James i. 27, Pure religion, and undefiled before God
   and the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
   affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world;' Heb. xiii.
   16, To do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices
   God is well pleased;' Eph. v. 21, 22, Submitting yourselves one to
   another in the fear of God.' Now a true Christian maketh conscience of
   all this; as of internal worship, so external; as of solemn and sacred
   acts, so of a constant awfulness of God.

   2. Secondly, The reasons.

   1st, Why a true Christian doth worship God.

   2dly, Why in the spirit.

   1st, For the worship itself.

   [1.] Because they have a deep sense of his being and excellency
   impressed upon their hearts.

   (1.) His being. These two notions live and die together: that God is,
   and that he ought to be worshipped and served, Heb. xi. 6; the one
   immediately floweth from the other. The first commandment is, Thou
   shalt have no other gods before me;' the second, Thou shalt not worship
   a graven image.' If God be, worship is certainly due to him: they that
   have no worship are as if they had no God. The psalmist proveth atheism
   by that: Ps. xiv. 1, The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God;'
   and ver. 4, They call not upon God.'

   (2.) His excellency. They have a clearer sight of God than others have,
   and are more acquainted with him than others are; and, therefore, are
   more prone to worship. When God had proclaimed his name, and manifested
   himself to Moses, Exod. xxxiv. 8, He made haste, and bowed himself to
   the earth, and worshipped.' None so ready and forward: Ps. ix. 10, They
   that know thy name will put their trust in thee.'

   [2.] Because they have a principle within them which inclineth them to
   God: their hearts are carried to him, as light bodies are carried
   upward. There is such a grace as godliness, 2 Pet. i. 6, and distinct
   in the notion from righteousness and holiness: 1 Tim. vi. 11, Follow
   after righteousness, godliness;' 2 Pet. iii. 11, What manner of persons
   ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness?' What is the
   notion then of it? It is tendentia mentis in Deum--an impression left
   upon their hearts, which causeth a bent and tendency towards God, as
   the fountain of their mercies, the joy of their souls, and the centre
   of their rest. There is such an inclination--in some stronger, in
   others more remiss; but in all that are made partakers of a divine
   nature in some good degree, so as ordinarily to prevail over the
   inclinations of the flesh. As holiness noteth purity of life, so
   godliness an inclination to God.

   [3.] Because of their relations to God, which they own. God pleadeth
   his right: Mal. i. 6, If I be a father, where is mine honour? if I be a
   master, where is my fear?' A father must have honour, and a master must
   have fear; and God, who is the common parent and absolute master of
   all, must have both. A worship and honour in which reverence and fear
   is mixed with love and joy; or, as the owning of a king implieth
   submission to his government, so the owning of a God adoration and
   worship.

   2dly, Why in the spirit?

   [1.] Because worship without the spirit is like a body without the
   soul; it is but the carcase of a duty. The heart must be the principal
   and chief agent in this business: Mat. xv. 8, This people draweth nigh
   to me with their mouths, and honoureth me with their lips, but their
   hearts are far from me.' There is no love to God, rather an habitual
   aversion from him.

   [2.] External worship is but a means to the internal; as prayer,
   hearing, reading, receiving, tend to promote love, trust,
   heavenly-mindedness, self-denial, mortification, purity of life and
   conversation. Now, as the means are only valuable with respect to their
   end, so are these duties of hearing, reading, singing. Diligence in the
   use of means is good, but those acts that are conversant about the end
   are better,--such as the love of God, and delight and trust in God; for
   finis est nobilior mediis. Nay, amongst the internal acts, as they are
   means to one another, so the nearer respect they have to the last end,
   the more noble they are; as faith is more noble than bare knowledge,
   because knowledge tendeth to faith, Ps. ix. 10; love than faith, be
   cause faith tendeth to love, Gal. v. 6; 1 Cor. xiii. 13. Faith causeth
   love, and serveth as the bellows to enkindle this holy fire; and in
   love, desire maketh way for delight, as its noblest act. And
   accordingly must all things be valued as they suit the great end, which
   is the enjoying of God.

   [3.] A man doth not partake of the gospel blessing till he doth serve
   God in the spirit; that is, till he be made partaker of the
   regenerating grace and actual influence of the Holy Spirit.

   (1.) Of his regenerating grace: Rom. vii. 6, That we should serve in
   newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.' New life is
   the principle of evangelical obedience; and when we are renewed by the
   Holy Ghost, we walk in newness of conversation. The gospel is a
   ministry of the Spirit, 2 Cor. iii. 8. It not only requireth duty, but
   giveth power to perform it. The letter of the law requireth, but giveth
   no principle or inclination to do it; that is from regenerating grace,
   or the law written upon our hearts: John iii. 6, That which is born of
   Spirit, is spirit;' that is, suited, inclined, disposed, fitted for a
   spiritual life.

   (2.) Actual influence. He still worketh in us what is pleasing in God's
   sight; helpeth to mortify corruption: Rom. viii. 13, If ye through the
   Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.' To perfect
   holiness, Heb. xiii. 21, that so we may serve God in all purity of
   life. We cannot get, nor keep, nor act, nor increase grace of
   ourselves, if forsaken by the Spirit of grace; the foulest sins would
   be come our pleasure, and the most unquestionable duties our burden. If
   he withdraw his quickening influences, you can do nothing.

   Use 1. It reproveth those that either do not worship God, or by halves,
   or not worship him in the Spirit.

   1. It disproveth their confidence that do not worship God. There are an
   irreligious sort of men that neither call upon him in public or in
   private, in the family or in the closet, but wholly forget the God that
   made them, and at whose expense they are maintained and kept.

   [1.] Let me reason with you as men. Wherefore had you reason able
   souls, but to praise, and honour, and glorify your Creator and
   Preserver? If you believe there is a God, why do you not call upon him?
   The neglect of his worship argueth a doubting of his being. If there be
   such a supreme Lord, to whom you must one day give an account, how dare
   you live without him in the world? All the creatures glorify him, Ps.
   cxlv. 10; they passively, but you have a heart and a tongue to glorify
   him actually. Man is the mouth of the creation, to return to God the
   praise of all that wisdom, glory, and power which is seen in the things
   that are made. Now, you should make one among the worshippers of God.

   [2.] Let me reason with you as Christians. Are you a Christian, and
   have such advantages to know more of God, and will you be dumb and
   tongue-tied in his praise? Have you the discovery of the wonders of his
   love in your redemption by Christ, and do you see no cause to own and
   acknowledge him? Have you no necessities to bring to the throne of
   grace? In Christianity, you know his particular providence and
   redemption by Christ, and should you eat, and drink, and trade, and
   sleep, and never think of God? Have you no pardon to sue out, no grace
   that you stand in need of, that you should live like a brute beast, go
   on in the circle of trade, business, comforts, and never think of God?
   You profess you know him, but in your works you deny him, and sin
   doubly, both against the light of reason and Christianity. All that are
   not avowed atheists must have some worship.

   2. It cutteth off their confidence that worship him by halves. They are
   of many sorts.

   [1.] Some worship him in public, but never in private and secret;
   though Christ hath given us direction to enter into our closets, Mat.
   vi. 6. And surely every Christian should make conscience of secret
   duties. There are many disputes about praying in families, though those
   that take their daily bread should seek God together; but there can be
   no dispute about praying in secret, for the precept that requireth
   prayer first falleth upon single persons before it falleth upon
   families and churches: 1 Thes. v. 17, Pray without ceasing.' This
   cannot concern families and churches; they are done at stated times,
   when they can conveniently meet; but every man in secret is to be often
   with God. Christ was often alone: Mark i. 35, He went out into a
   solitary place, and there prayed.' Surely Christ had not such need to
   pray as we have, nor such need of retirement, his love to God being
   always fervent, and so in no danger of distraction. God poured out the
   Spirit that we might go apart and mourn over soul-distempers, Zech.
   xii. 10-14. Now, God's precious gifts are not given in vain. So, Acts
   x. 2, Cornelius prayed to God alway.' Therefore, certainly, secret
   prayer is a necessary duty of God's worship, to be observed by all that
   acknowledge God to be God, and the world to be ruled by his providence,
   or themselves to have any need of his grace and pardon, or hope for
   anything from him in the world to come. Therefore, if you have any
   sense of religion, or think you have any need of particular commerce
   with God, you should make conscience of secret prayer.

   [2.] Others that make conscience of external worship, prayer, hearing,
   reading, singing of psalms, but not of internal worship, faith, love,
   and hope. The external forms were appointed for the acting or
   increasing of internal grace; and so they superficially are conversant
   about the means, and never mind the end. External worship is sensible
   and easily done, but internal worship is difficult. External worship
   may procure us esteem with men; but internal, acceptance with God.
   External worship satisfieth blind conscience, but doth not better the
   heart. External worship may puff us up with a vain confidence, but
   internal worship maketh us lament spiritual defects. We have not that
   purity of heart, that deep sense of the world to come, that absolute
   dependence upon God, which may quiet our souls in all exigencies.
   Surely they are better Christians that have the effect of the
   ordinances than they that have only the formality of them. The external
   duty may procure us toil and wearisomeness to the flesh, but the
   internal worship bringeth us comfort and peace. The more faith in
   Christ, and love to God, and lively hope of eternal life, the more is
   the soul comforted. Therefore, if you will always lick the glass, and
   never taste the honey, go on in a track of duties, but you will have no
   comfort in them. In short, they that go on in external duties may be
   said in some sense to serve God, but they do not seek after him. In
   pretence they make God the object of their worship, for they do not
   worship an idol; but they do not make him the end of their worship. A
   man maketh God the end of his worship when he will not go away from God
   without God; when he looketh to this, that his delight in God be
   quickened, his dependence upon God strengthened, his hatred of sin
   increased, and by every address to God is made more like God.

   [3.] It reproveth and disproveth those that put on a garb of devotion
   when ministering before the Lord, but are slight and vain in their
   ordinary conversation. A man should be in some measure such out of duty
   as he giveth out himself to be in duty; for his whole life should be,
   as it were, a continued act of worship: Prov. xxiii. 17, Let not thy
   heart envy sinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day
   long.' We should still live in a dependence upon God, and in subjection
   to him: Ps. xvi. 8, I have set the Lord always before me: he is at my
   right hand, I shall not be moved.' In point of reverence, and in point
   of dependence, because we are in danger to miscarry, both by the
   delights of sense and the terrors of sense. If a reverence of and a
   dependence on the great God do still possess our hearts, we shall carry
   ourselves more soberly as to the comforts of the world, and not be
   easily discouraged and daunted with the fears of the world. This is our
   preservative, and maketh us true and faithful to our great end.

   3. Those that do not serve God in the spirit. You should worship God so
   as it may look like worship and service performed to God, and due to
   God. It is spiritual worship God requireth, and is ever pleased withal.
   He seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth,'
   John iv. 23; and this is most agreeable to his nature: John iv. 24, God
   is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
   in truth.' When hearts wander, when affections do not answer
   expressions, is this like service and worship done to an all-seeing and
   all-knowing spirit? Is there any stamp of God upon the duty, of his
   majesty, goodness, and great power?

   Use 2. For the comfort of good Christians. Here is their carriage
   towards God briefly set down--they worship God in the spirit.' A
   Christian is described by his proper act, worship; and by the proper
   object thereof, God; and by the proper part and seat thereof, in the
   spirit. Do you worship him with reverence, and with delight and
   affection, with a trust, hope, and confidence?

   1. With reverence. Considering God's majesty and our own vileness. The
   majesty of God: Mal. i. 14, For I am a great king, saith the Lord of
   hosts.' Slight worship argueth lessening thoughts of God. Do you know
   to whom you speak? It is a contempt of God if you think anything will
   serve the turn; you have mean thoughts of him, and do not consider him
   as you ought to do. So our vileness: Gen. xviii. 27, Who am I, that am
   but dust and ashes, that I should speak unto God?'--dust as to the
   baseness of his original, and ashes by the desert of sin. In our nearer
   approaches to God, thus should we think of ourselves.

   2. With delight and affection, as our reconciled father in Christ. So
   he is to us as the well-spring of all grace and goodness. The great
   work of the gospel is to bring us to God as a father, Gal. iv. 6. God
   as a judge, by the spirit of bondage, driveth us to Christ; but Christ,
   by the spirit of adoption, bringeth us back again to God as a father.
   This is the evangelical way of worshipping, that in a child-like manner
   we may come to God.

   3. With trust, hope, and confidence. He knoweth all our wants, can
   relieve all our necessities: Ps. lvii. 2, I will cry unto God most
   high, who performeth all things for me.' Worship would be a cold
   formality if we had to do with one that knew us not, or had not
   sufficiency and power to help us, But God is omniscient and
   all-sufficient, and hath promised to hear and help us in our straits;
   he knoweth our necessities when we know them not.

   II. We come now to the second character: And rejoice in Christ Jesus.

   Thence observe:--

   Doct. That the great work of a Christian is a rejoicing in Christ
   Jesus, or a thankful sense of our Redeemer's mercy.

   In opening this point I shall use this method:--

   1st, Show you what is this rejoicing in Christ.

   2dly, I shall prove that Christ is matter of true rejoicing in his
   person, offices, benefits.

   3dly, That Christians are not sound and sincere in their profession,
   unless they do keep up this rejoicing in Christ.

   First, What is this rejoicing?--(kau cho'menoi en Christo Iesou). The
   original word implieth such a degree of joy as amounts to glorification
   or boasting, or such an exultation of mind as breaketh out into some
   sensible expression of it. There are in it three things:--

   1. An apprehension of the good and benefit which we have by Christ; for
   otherwise how can we rejoice and glory in him? 1 Cor. i. 30, 31, But of
   him ye are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and
   righteousness, and sanctification and redemption; that according as it
   is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.' Christ is
   all: that our whole rejoicing may be in him, who hath enlightened us
   with the knowledge of the gospel, and showed us the way of salvation,
   and is the author of our justification and sanctification, and of our
   deliverance from all calamities, and from death itself. These benefits
   are the cause of our rejoicing--namely, the promises of the gospel,
   sealed by his death, and the graces conveyed to us by his Spirit. We
   rejoice and glory in him, as the only and all-sufficient Saviour. They
   that gloried in circumcision gloried in their entrance into the legal
   covenant; they became debtors to the law, but Christ hath ratified it
   in the new covenant by his blood; therefore here is more abundant cause
   of rejoicing.

   2. Due affections of contentment, joy, love, exultation of heart, that
   followeth thereupon. A blessing ourselves in our portion, that this
   great happiness is fallen to our share, offered to us, at least, if not
   possessed by us. The very knowledge of Christianity breedeth joy: Acts
   viii. 8, And there was great joy in that city,' that is, upon the
   tendering of the gospel; much more when we believe in Christ, and
   embrace his religion, and resolve to become his disciples. They
   received his word gladly, Acts ii. 41. His doctrine must be welcomed
   with the heart, with all love and thankfulness. It is said of the
   jailor, Acts xvi. 34, that he rejoiced, believing in God, and all his
   house.' He was but newly recovered out of the suburbs of hell, ready to
   kill himself but just before; so that a man would think it were easier
   to fetch water out of a flint, or a spark of fire out of the bottom of
   the sea, than to expect or find joy in such a heart; yea, though still
   in danger of life for treating those as guests whom he should have kept
   as prisoners, yet he rejoiced when acquainted with salvation by Christ.
   More especially should we rejoice when the comfort is sealed up to our
   consciences: Rom. v. 11, Not only so, but we also joy in God, through
   our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.' The
   eunuch, when he was baptized, he went on his way rejoicing,' Acts viii.
   39.

   3. An expression of it, by an open profession of Christ's name, both in
   word and deed, whatever it costs us. They are said to rejoice in Christ
   Jesus who in those times could profess his name, though with hazard and
   self-denial. As the Thessalonians, who received the word with much
   affliction, and much assurance and joy in the Holy Ghost, 1 Thes. i. 6.
   And it is expressed by the parable of the man that found the true
   treasure, and for joy thereof sold all that he had to buy the field,
   Mat. xiii. 44. They are willing to lose all other contentments and
   satisfactions for this; Christ is enough. They needed this joy to
   encourage them against the trials which they then under went for
   Christ's sake and the gospel's sake.

   Secondly, That Christ is matter of true rejoicing, for they are fools
   that rejoice in baubles and trifles. A Christian's joy may be owned and
   justified. When Christ's birth was celebrated by angels, it is said,
   Luke ii. 10, Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy.' Here is
   joy, and great joy in salvation by Christ. And Mary: Luke i. 46, 47, My
   soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my
   Saviour.' Surely there is no cause of joy wanting in God, and in God
   coming as a Saviour. In short, in Christianity, all is fitted to fill
   our hearts with delight and joy.

   1. The wonderful mysteries of our redemption by Christ. Thereby,

   [1.] A way is found out for our reconciliation with God, and how that
   dreadful controversy may be taken up, and heaven and earth may kiss
   each other, 2 Cor. v. 19. Surely this is glad tidings of great joy to
   self-condemned sinners, who stood always in fear of the wrath of God
   and the flames of hell. What joy is it to a condemned man, that is
   ready every day to be taken away to execution, to hear that his peace
   is made, that pardon may be had, if he will seek it and sue it out!

   [2.] A distinct relation of a defeat of the great enemies of our
   salvation death, hell, the devil, and the world. He hath not only made
   our peace with the Father, by the blood of his cross, but vanquished
   our spiritual enemies, and triumphed over them, Col. ii. 14, 15. Long
   enough might we have lain in prison before the utmost farthing had been
   paid, or done anything to procure our deliverance, if our compassionate
   Redeemer had not taken the work in hand: had he turned us to any
   creature, we had been helpless. It was he purchased grace to overcome
   the devil, the world, and the flesh; that quickened you when you were
   dead in sin; that put Satan out of office, and delivered us from the
   present evil world,' Gal. i. 4. And is not this matter of rejoicing to
   us?

   [3.] That hereby he hath not only abolished death, but brought life and
   resurrection to light, 2 Tim. i. 10. By entering into that other world,
   after his sufferings, he hath given us a visible demonstration of the
   reality of the world to come, and in his gospel discovered a
   blessedness to us, which satiateth the heart of man and salveth the
   great sore of the whole creation. If God had made nothing richer than
   the world, the heart of man would have been as leviathan in a little
   pool.

   2. In the promises of Christ there is matter of joy. In the general,
   God is your God, and that is more than to have all the world to be
   yours: compare Gen. xvii. 7, I will establish my covenant between me
   and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an
   everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy seed after thee,'
   with Ps. cxliv. 15, Happy is that people whose God is the Lord.' We
   have an eternal and all-sufficient God to live upon, and from whom to
   derive our joy and comfort; a God infinite in power, wisdom, and
   goodness to be our portion. And where is matter of joy and comfort, if
   not in God? Behold the difference between carnal men and the children
   of God; the world is their portion, and God is ours; and who is better
   provided for? More especially we are told, 1 Tim. iv. 8, that Godliness
   hath the promises of this life, and that which is to come.' Heaven and
   earth are laid at the feet of godliness; what would you more? Surely we
   have full consolation offered to us in the promises of the gospel; he
   can want nothing to his comfort who hath an interest in them. To
   instance, in the lowest blessings, those which concern this life: God
   is our God, that can cure all diseases, overcome all enemies, supply
   all wants, deliver in all dangers, and will do it so far as is for our
   good; and desires of anything beyond this are not to be satisfied, but
   mortified, Ps. lxxxiv. 11. But then for the more excel lent promises of
   the new covenant, which concern another world, such as the pardoning of
   our sins, the healing our natures, and the glorifying of our persons: 2
   Pet. i. 4, Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
   promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,
   having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.' The
   pardon of all our sins, which are the great trouble and burden of the
   creatures. Who will rejoice like the pardoned sinner, who is discharged
   of his debt, eased of his burthen, and hath his filth covered? Ps.
   xxxii. 1, Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
   is covered.' Oh, the blessedness of the man! He is like one fetched
   back from execution. Then the taking away of the stony heart, and the
   giving of an holy and heavenly heart. Oh, what matter of joy is this,
   to have all things necessary to life and godliness! What is the trouble
   of a gracious heart, but the relics of corruption? Rom. vii. 24. Paul
   groaneth sorely, but yet blesseth God for his hopes by Christ, ver. 25.
   Renewing grace is dearly bought, and plentifully bestowed, Titus iii.
   5, 6; and graciously offered to those that will seek after it: Prov. i.
   23, Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto
   you.' And this promise to be fulfilled by a divine power, 2 Peter i. 3.
   Oh, what a comfort is the Redeemer's grace to a soul that hath been
   long exercised in subduing sin! It is true it groans while it is
   a-doing, yet the very groans of the sick show that life and health is
   sweet. Healing, renewing grace maketh other things sweet; as your whole
   duty to God, it maketh it become your delight. But the great promise is
   eternal life: 1 John ii. 25, And this is the promise that he hath
   promised us, even eternal life.' That is a matter of joy indeed. What!
   to live for ever with God! the forethought of it reviveth us; the
   foretaste of it is a kind of heaven upon earth, 1 Peter i. 8. The
   certain hope of it will swallow up all grief and sorrow, Rom. v. 2, 3.
   So that there is no question but that in the promises of Christ there
   is matter of great joy.

   3. The enjoyments of Christianity are very pleasing. I add this to show
   you, that it is not all in expectation, if we consider not only what we
   shall be, but what we are. For the present:--

   [1.] We have peace of conscience, Rom. v. 1; Mat. xi. 29; Phil, iv. 7.
   Rest for our souls is anxiously sought after in other things, but only
   found in Christ's religion, and living according to the precepts and
   institutions thereof. As Noah's dove found not a place whereon to rest
   the sole of her foot, so we flutter up and down, but never have any
   firm peace of heart and conscience, till we submit to Christ, and take
   his counsel.

   [2.] A sense of the love of God: Rom. v. 5, Because the love of God is
   shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto us;' and 1
   Peter ii. 3, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.'

   [3.] God's presence with us, and our communion with him: 1 John i. 3,
   4, And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ, that your joy may be full;' and John viii. 29.

   [4.] Access to God, with assurance of welcome and audience: John xvi.
   24, Whatsoever ye ask in my name, ye shall receive, that your joy may
   be full.'

   [5.] The foretastes of the life to come, Rom. viii. 23, and 2 Cor. iii.
   5. So that all is to stir up this delight and joy in the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   4. The precepts of Christ show that we have matter of rejoicing in him.
   What are the great duties required? To love God! Now what pain is it to
   delight in the Lord as our all-sufficient portion? To be mindful of
   him, and meditate of his excellencies and benefits: Ps. civ. 34, My
   meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the Lord.' Is it
   any toilsome thing to come in a childlike manner and unbosom .ourselves
   to him, and beg the renewed testimonies of his love to us, especially
   when set awork by the Holy Ghost? Gal. iv. (5. To believe in Christ is
   difficult, but pleasant; to consider the Lord Jesus as the suitable
   remedy for the lapsed estate of mankind, both as to his work with God
   and us, Heb. iii. 1. He came to destroy sin and misery. Whenever we
   reflect upon Christ, what do we find but ample grounds of joy? John
   xiv. 2, Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God, believe
   also in me;' that is, to get off our trouble, consider we have an
   all-sufficient God, and an all-sufficient mediator: Rom. xv. 13, Now
   the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye
   may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.' Repentance
   requireth sorrow for sin, only as it tendeth to joy and comfort, Mat.
   v. 5. It is a tormenting, but a curing sorrow. The word of God taketh
   care that a penitent, who hath foully miscarried, should not be
   swallowed up of over-much grief, 2 Cor. ii. 7. In the general,
   repentance and mortification are our physic to expel the noxious
   humours that would bring us, not only to death, but to damnation, and
   to keep the soul in due plight and health. And then, for
   self-government, we are to bridle our passions and appetites: Gal. v.
   24, They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the
   affections and lusts.' The bridling our passions, it is but forbidding
   us to be miserable, and throw out everything that would disquiet the
   soul. Christ's great care was that the reasonable creature might live
   in peace and holy security, therefore hath discharged our cares, and
   sorrows, and fears: our cares, that they might not distract our minds:
   Phil. iv. 6, Be careful for nothing;' and 1 Peter v. 7, Cast all your
   care upon the Lord.' These prohibitions show you the goodness of
   Christ. He hath made it unlawful for you to be troubled, and to perplex
   your minds with anxious and distrustful thoughts. Oh! what pleasant
   lives we might live if we could entirely cast ourselves into the arms
   of God, and refer all things to the wisdom and powerful conduct of his
   providence! The scripture is as plentiful also in for bidding sorrow: 1
   Thes. iv. 13, Sorrow not as those that are without hope.' Dejection and
   anguish of spirit is your sin. So for fear: Isa. xli. 10, Fear not, for
   I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God;' Heb. xiii. 6, So
   that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man
   can do unto me.' What should a Christian fear? Dangers by the way?--God
   is his helper. To be cast into hell when he goeth out of the
   world?--Christ hath showed him how to flee from wrath to come; he
   feareth it with a fear of caution, so as to shun it, but not with a
   fear of perplexity, so as to disquiet and perplex his soul, for Jesus
   hath delivered him from wrath to come, 1 Thes. i. 10. Christianity is
   as contrary to sadness and misery, as life to death, and light to
   darkness. For the other, the crucifying and bridling of our lusts,
   which carry us to the good things of this world, why, that is
   troublesome, to be debarred of the delights which nature affects; but
   here are no rigorous exactions, but such as are agreeable to the reason
   able nature. Christ hath forbidden us no pleasure but what may be a sin
   or a snare to us; he would not have man to degenerate and turn beast.
   All Christ's restraints are but necessary cautions for our safety. Is
   it burdensome to a man to keep out of danger's way, and to avoid such
   things as are destructive to his soul? If a friend will take out of our
   hands the knife with which we would not only cut our fingers but our
   throats, is he to be blamed? or is he your enemy who forbiddeth you to
   drink poison? Forbidden fruit costs dear in the issue.

   5. For those duties which concern our neighbour. To love all men, to do
   good to all men, it is a blessed and godlike thing to be giving rather
   than receiving, Acts xx. 35. The delight of doing good is much more
   than the cost; it is to be as earthly gods among our neighbours. This
   work rewardeth itself, because it is such a contentment and
   satisfaction to our minds. For justice: To do as we would be done to;
   what more pleasant? We would have others bound by these laws, why not
   ourselves? It is horrible to require one measure of dealing from them
   to us, and use a quite contrary ourselves. Would men hate, defraud,
   oppress others, and expect nothing but kind and righteous dealing from
   them? this is a gross partiality. Therefore, as our interest calleth
   for justice, so doth our conscience, and it would be a trouble and an
   affront to reason not to do it. So for fidelity in our relations. These
   things maintain order of families, and conduce to our safety and
   private peace, as well as they belong to our duty to God; so that on
   which side soever we look, we see what matter of joy there is in
   Christ.

   I come now to show you:--

   Thirdly, The reasons why Christians are not sound and sincere in their
   profession unless they keep up this rejoicing in Christ.

   1. We do not else give Christ his due honour, if we do not esteem him
   who is so excellent in himself and so beneficial to us, even to a
   degree of rejoicing. The magnifying of Christ was intended by God in
   the whole business of our redemption and deliverance, that we might
   esteem him, delight in him, count all things dung and dross that we
   might gain him. Now we do not comply with this end, but have mean
   thoughts of his grace, if we be not affected with joy at it.

   It argueth a double defect:--

   [1.] That we are not sensible of our great misery without him; nor

   [2.] Affected with the great love he hath showed in our deliverance,
   and the felicity accruing to us thereby.

   [1.] We are not duly sensible of our great misery without him. Alas!
   what could we have done without his passion and intercession? If he had
   not died for sinners, what had you to answer to the terrors of the law,
   the accusations of your consciences, the fears of hell, and approaching
   damnation? How could you look God in the face, or think one comfortable
   thought of him? Had we wept out our eyes, and prayed out our hearts,
   and never committed sin again, this would not have made God
   satisfaction for sin past: paying new debts doth not quit old scores:
   long enough might we have lain in our blood ere we could have found out
   a ransom which God would accept; besides him there is no Saviour. And
   then for his intercession: If he did not hide your nakedness and
   procure you a daily pardon, you would not be an hour longer out of
   hell. If he did not bring you to God, you could have no comfortable
   access to him; your prayers would be cast back as dung in your faces,
   if the merit of his sacrifice did not make them accepted. And shall all
   this be told you, and owned by you for truth, and will you not rejoice
   that God hath found a ransom and provided an intercessor for you?
   Surely it cannot be imagined that you are sensible of your case if you
   be not thankful for your remedy.

   [2.] You are not affected with the great love which Christ hath showed
   in your deliverance, nor the felicity accruing to you thereby. It is
   said, Eph. iii. 19, That you may know the love of God, which passeth
   knowledge.' Before he had pressed them to make it their study to
   comprehend the height, length, and breadth; and when they have all
   done, the love of Christ passeth knowledge. Christ would pose men and
   angels with an heap of wonders in delivering us from misery and sin.
   Now should not we rejoice and make our boast of this? Surely we vilify
   and bring down the price of these wonders of love, if we entertain them
   with cold thoughts, and without some considerable acts of joy and
   thankfulness. Shall angels wonder, and we, the parties interested, not
   rejoice? Certainly we are not affected with the great felicity accruing
   to us. Felicity cannot be sought after without the highest affections
   and endeavours. Now, if we can rejoice in trifles, and not rejoice in
   the love of God, how can we be said to mind these things?

   2. A man's joy distinguished him. There is a seeking joy and a
   complacential joy: Ps. cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way of thy
   testimonies, as much as in all riches.' It is good to observe what it
   is that putteth gladness into our hearts: the love of God, and his
   goodness in Christ. Every man is discovered by his complacency or
   displacency: Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put gladness into my heart, more than
   in the time that their corn and their wine increased;' Rom. viii. 5,
   They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they
   that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.' To rejoice in the
   creatures, as accommodating or pleasing the flesh, is the joy of the
   carnal; to rejoice in outward ordinances and privileges, without other
   things, is the joy of the hypocrite and common professors. Let us carry
   it a little farther. The devils and damned are out of all hope and
   possibility of joy; the angels and glorified saints rejoice in the full
   fruition of God: there is gaudium viæ and gaudium patriæ; there is the
   joy of the way, and the joy of our home at our journey's end. The
   latter is set forth, Ps. xvi. 11, In thy presence is fulness of joy; at
   thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.' The other is in Christ, and
   the use of his healing and recovering methods, and the desires and
   hopes of the glory to come. This is the joy, or well-pleasedness of
   mind, which is proper to us in our journey: 1 Pet. i. 8, In whom
   believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.' The
   comfort of travellers differeth from that which a man hath in heaven:
   it is a joy that he hath as he is going home; and therefore how should
   the serious Christian be described, but by his rejoicing in Christ
   Jesus?

   Use 1. To reprove those that cannot keep up their rejoicing in Christ
   Jesus as soon as they are mated with any calamity or affliction in the
   world. Is not grace better than any natural comfort taken from us? Heb.
   xii. 11. No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
   grievous: nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. Surely, when we
   have such cause of rejoicing in Christ, to be dejected with every
   little adversity showeth weak faith. Have you peace with God and
   communion with him at every turn, and shall a blasting of the creature
   destroy all your comfort? Have you hope of glory, and can not you bear
   a disappointment in the world? Are you assured of the care of your
   heavenly Father, and his particular providence over you, and yet so
   full of grudging and repining thoughts when he retrencheth you a little
   and blasteth your worldly probabilities? Surely it argueth too much
   addictedness to present comforts and love of the ease of the flesh.
   Have you a due sense of the world to come, and that better and enduring
   substance, and yet complain so bitterly of worldly losses? Have you a
   God in covenant with you who hath engaged all his love, wisdom, and
   power, to help you, and to turn all things to your good? Rom. viii. 28.
   What though the trial of your faith and patience be very sore? Did you
   capitulate with God and bargain with him how much you would suffer the
   flesh to be crossed, and that in such sharp afflictions you would be
   excused, that your gourd should not be altogether smitten and dried up?
   You can bear any other cross but this; but was this excepted out of
   your resignation?

   2. It reproveth those that cherish a carnal rejoicing. A believer
   should rejoice in Christ Jesus: Luke x. 19, 20, Behold, I give unto you
   power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
   enemy, &c. Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not that the spirits are
   subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in
   heaven,' Rejoice not in this, that you are in dignity and honour; this
   is not your felicity, nor the direct way to your felicity. The higher
   you climb, your station is the more dangerous: they are safer that
   stand on the ground, than those that are on a pinnacle. Rejoice not in
   that you have abundance of earthly riches, but that, you have a taste
   of higher and better things. Be not affected so deeply with lower
   mercies as to overlook the special mercies that accompany salvation.
   Rejoice not in this, that you have convenient habitations in this
   world, but in that you have a building of God, an house not made with
   hands, eternal in the heavens; in that you have comely bodies, but that
   you have hopes of a better resurrection, when this mortal shall put on
   immortality; not in the nobility of your birth, but that you are born
   of the Spirit: John i. 12, 13, To as many as received him, to them gave
   he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
   of the will of man, but of God.' Rejoice not in that you have great
   friends to stand by you, but that in the new covenant you are made a
   friend of God, as Abraham was. Not in that you have costly
   accommodations to please the flesh: no, this may be the bane of your
   souls: Rom. viii. 13, They that live after the flesh shall die;' and
   Luke xvi. 25, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy
   good things.' (Dives fared deliciously every day, and Lazarus was full
   of sores, and desirous to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
   rich man's table.) Thou hast received thy good things, and Lazarus evil
   things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.'

   Use 2. Is to encourage you to rejoice in Christ Jesus. Now, because we
   are helpers of your joy, 2 Cor. i. 24, and God is best pleased with
   this frame of spirit, 1 Thes. v. 16, I shall resume the main discourse;
   and

   I. Handle the nature of it.

   II. Show you whether this joy may be without assurance.

   III. Show you the spiritual profit of it.

   IV. The helps or means by which it is raised in us.

   I. For the nature of it. It is an act of love, begotten in us by the
   sense of the love of Christ, revealed in the word, and shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost, whereby the soul is more affected with
   delight in the grace of the Redeemer than with all other things
   whatsoever.

   In which description observe:--

   1. It is an act of love. The acts of love are two--desire and delight.
   They both agree in this: that they are conversant about good, and are
   founded in esteem. We think it good. They differ, because desire is the
   motion and exercise of love, and delight the quiet and repose of it.
   Desire is expressed in that speech, Ps. lxiii. 8, My soul followeth
   hard after thee.' A believer cannot forbear to seek after God. Desire
   of union keepeth us up in the pursuit of him. Delight is expressed in
   that form of speech, Ps. xvi. 5, 6, The Lord is the portion of my
   inheritance and my cup. The lines are fallen unto me in a pleasant
   place; yea, I have a goodly heritage.' He hath all his joy, and
   pleasure, and contentment in God. Desire supposeth some want or absence
   of the valued object; delight, some kind of enjoyment. Either he is
   ours, or might be ours if we would ourselves; for the offer is cause of
   joy, as well as the enjoyment. If our desires have reached the lovely
   object, it is cause of joy, or if it be within our reach; as when
   Christ and his benefits are offered to us, and left upon our choice.
   And therefore it is said, Jonah ii. 8, They that observe lying
   vanities, forsake their own mercies.' Their own, though not possessed
   by them, yet they are offered to them: they might have been their own,
   if they did not exclude themselves. The object is in a sort present,
   and brought home to us in the offers of the gospel.

   2. It is an act of love begotten in us by the sense of the love of
   Christ. For love only begetteth love: 1 John iv. 19, We love him,
   because he loved us first.' The object of love is goodness. Now, we
   loved God in Christ, for the goodness that is in him, the goodness that
   floweth from him, and the goodness we expect from him; all these
   attract our love.

   [1.] The goodness that is in him, moral and beneficial. Moral, which is
   his holiness: Ps. cxix. 140, Thy word is very pure, therefore thy
   servant loveth it.' If we love his law for the purity thereof, then
   certainly we must love God. How else can we study to imitate him? for
   we imitate only that which we love and delight in as good. Then for his
   beneficial goodness, Ps. c. 5, For the Lord is good; his mercy is
   everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations;' and Ps. cxix.
   68, Thou art good, and doest good.'

   [2.] The goodness that floweth from him; not only in our creation, but
   our redemption by Christ, which is the stupendous instance of his
   goodness to man: Titus iii. 4, After the kindness and love of God our
   Saviour towards man appeared,' &c. (In the creation there was
   philangeli'a; in redemption, philanthropi'a.) That God found a ransom
   for us, and so great as his only-begotten Son, this was love and
   goodness indeed.

   [3.] The goodness we expect from him, both in this world and the next.
   Here reconciliation and remission of sins, which is a blessing that
   doth much draw the heart of man to delight in Christ; for she loved
   much to whom much was forgiven, Luke vii. 47. We keep off from a
   condemning God, but draw nigh to a pardoning God. Therefore the apostle
   saith, Heb. vii. 19, The bringing in of this better hope by the gospel
   doth cause us to draw nigh to God. Being at peace with God, and
   reconciled to him, we may have access with confidence and boldness to
   the throne of grace; are no more at distance with God, looking upon him
   as a consuming fire. The gospel giveth us liberty to come to him, and
   expect the mercy and bounty of God, through Jesus Christ. So in the
   next world eternal life and glory, which is our great reward, merited
   by Christ: Mat. v. 12, Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is
   your reward in heaven.' This is a solid, lasting, satisfying,
   substantial good. Worldly joys are but seeming, they appear and vanish
   in a moment, every blast of temptation scattereth them. Well, then,
   offers of pardon and life by Christ are the matters of this joy, as
   they free us from the greatest miseries, and bring us to the enjoyment
   of the truest happiness. If you ask me, then, Why is a Christian
   described rather by rejoicing in Christ than by rejoicing in the pardon
   of sins and eternal blessedness? I answer, Because Christ is the author
   and procurer of these things to us; and by our joy we express not only
   our esteem of these benefits, but our gratitude and thankfulness for
   the mercy and bounty of God, and the great love of our Redeemer.

   3. The description showeth how the sense of this goodness is begotten
   in us. The love of Christ is revealed in the word and shed abroad in
   our' hearts by the Holy Ghost; and I add, believed by faith, and
   improved by meditation.

   [1.] It is revealed in the gospel, or word of salvation which is sent
   to us. Therefore it is said, Acts xiii. 48, When the Gentiles heard
   this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God; and as many as
   were ordained to eternal life believed.' Surely the mind of man, which
   is naturally discomforted and weakened, and strangely haunted with
   doubts and fears about the pardon of sin and eternal life, is mightily
   revived and encouraged with these glad tidings of this salvation
   dispensed to us by a sure covenant, Heb. vi. 18. And if the Gentiles
   that heard these things were glad, proportionably we should be glad,
   for the gospel should never be as stale news to sinners, or as a jest
   often told. Our necessities are as deep as theirs, and the covenant
   standeth as firm to us as it did to them; therefore if we have the
   heart of a guilty man, it should be as welcome to us.

   [2.] It is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. So much is
   asserted by the apostle: Rom. v. 5, The love of God is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.' Our dry reason
   cannot give such a lively sense of these comforts as the revelation of
   the Holy Ghost. And this is the difference between a believing by
   tradition and believing by inspiration. Believing by tradition giveth
   us but cold thoughts of these mysteries, but believing by inspiration
   warmeth the heart, and reviveth it with an unspeakable joy, and is
   called tasting the good word,' which is the privilege of those who are
   enlightened by the Spirit, Heb. vi. 4; and a tasting that the Lord is
   gracious, 1 Peter ii. 3; which much differeth from the common
   reflection upon those things which flesh and blood may give us, or the
   bare reports of men stir up in us. The Spirit's light is lovely, and
   ravisheth and transporteth the soul; and where it is permanent and
   rooted, it effectually changeth the soul. Some are altogether careless,
   not affected at all with these things, as the habituated worldly
   sinner, 1 Cor. ii. 14. They are folly to him; for spiritual things must
   be spiritually discerned. Some are to a degree affected by the common
   work of the Spirit, Heb. vi. 4-6; but it is not rooted, it is not
   predominate [5] , so as to control other affections and delights; they
   have a rejoicing in the offers of pardon and life, but it is a joy that
   leaveth some darling sin still predominant. But there is a third sort
   that have such a taste of these things that they are renewed and
   changed by it, Heb. iii. 6. Now, then, if you would have this rejoicing
   in Christ Jesus, you must apply yourselves to Christ, in the use of the
   appointed means, for the renewing of your natures; for love and delight
   are never forced, nor will be drawn forth by bare commands and
   threatenings, yea, and not by the proposal of promises, though the
   enjoyments be never so great and glorious. This may a little stir us,
   and this is the matter of joy, but not the cause of joy. But this joy
   proceedeth partly from the inclination when the heart is suited, and
   partly from the attractive goodness of the object; and both are
   powerfully done by the Holy Spirit as the heart is renewed, and the
   object is most effectually represented by him, Eph. i. 17, 18. And this
   we must wait for.

   [3.] It is received and believed by faith. This is often told us in the
   Scripture: 1 Peter i. 18, In whom believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable, and full of glory;' and Rom. xv. 13, The God of hope fill
   you with joy and peace in believing.' We cannot be affected with the
   great things Christ hath done and purchased for us till we believe
   them. There is in faith three things--assent, consent, and affiance.

   (1.) Assent, or a firm and certain belief of the truth of the gospel
   concerning Christ as the only sufficient Saviour, by whom alone God
   will give us the pardon of sins and eternal life: John iv. 42, We have
   heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
   Saviour of the world;' and John vi. 69, We believe and are sure that
   thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.' When we are verily
   persuaded of this, as we are of anything that appeareth true to us,
   this stirreth up joy. Others have but a hearsay knowledge, not a
   believing assent. Surely Christ is a delectable object; what hindereth,
   then, but that we rejoice in him? Nothing but want of faith; for if
   this be true, we so necessitous, and he so all-sufficient a remedy, why
   are we not so affected with these things as the worth of them doth
   deserve? Nothing can be rationally said but that we are not soundly
   persuaded of the truth of it.

   (2.) A consent. This grace is dispensed by a covenant which bindeth
   mutually, assureth us of happiness, and requireth duty from us.
   Therefore an unfeigned consent, or a readiness to fulfil those terms
   expressed in the promise, is required of us, or a resolution to repent
   and obey the gospel. Christ hath offices and relations that imply our
   comfort, and other offices and relations which imply our duty; or
   rather, the same do both. He is our teacher and king, as well as our
   priest; and we must submit to be ruled and taught by him, as well as
   depend upon the merit of his sacrifice and inter cession: Heb. v. 9,
   And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to
   all them that obey him.' And they are so taught the truth that is in
   Jesus, that they put off the old man, and put on the new, Eph. iv. 20,
   21. True believers must be scholars, daily learning somewhat from
   Christ; yea, his priesthood implieth duty, dependence, humble
   addresses; a broken-hearted coming to God by him; as his kingship and
   prophetical office implieth privilege also. His defending and teaching
   us by his Spirit.

   (3.) There is affiance, which is a reposing of our hearts, or a relying
   upon God promising remission of sins and eternal life for Christ's sake
   alone--that he will be as good as his word, while we diligently use the
   means ordained to this end, Rom. ii. 7. And this confidence hath an
   influence upon this joy, Heb. iii. 6, or a delightful sense of our
   Redeemer's grace.

   [4.] It is improved by meditation; for the greatest things do not work
   unless we think of them, and work them into our hearts. The natural way
   of operation is, that objects stir up thoughts, and thoughts stir up
   affections: Ps. civ. 34, My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be
   glad in the Lord.' The more frequent and serious thoughts we have of
   the love of God in Christ, and the more deep and ponderous they are,
   the more do they blow up this holy fire into a flame. Now, for this end
   was the Lord's Supper instituted, where the whole gospel is applied and
   sealed to us, that this delight might be afresh acted and stirred in us
   at the Lord's Table, while our minds are taken up in considering Christ
   the great apostle and high priest of our confession, Heb. iii. 1.
   Surely it should not be an idle and fruitless contemplation; it should
   stir up love, and what stirreth up love stirreth up delight. I come now
   to the last part of the description.

   [5.] The particular affection caused by this sense is mentioned: We
   delight in the grace of the Redeemer more than in all other things
   whatsoever.

   Where--(1.) Take notice of the affection itself.

   Then--(2.) The degree of it.

   (1.) The affection itself, which is delight, or a well-pleasedness of
   mind, in the grace that is brought to us by the knowledge of Christ.
   This enlargeth the heart, and filleth it with a sweetness and
   contentment; and the vent of it is praise, for the heart being
   enlarged, can not hold and contain itself: Ps. ix. 14, I will show
   forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Sion; I will
   rejoice in thy salvation.' Joy cannot be kept within doors; it will
   break out in all suitable ways of expression. The heart doth first
   rejoice, and then the tongue doth overflow. The heart is filled with
   joy, and then the tongue with thanksgiving. So Ps. xxxv. 9, My soul
   shall be joyful in the Lord; it shall rejoice in his salvation.'
   Nothing disposeth the heart to praise so much as this holy joy. There
   is no true thanksgiving if this be not at the bottom of it.

   (2.) For the degree: The heart doth delight in Christ above all other
   things. As to the sensitive expression in the lively stirring of joy,
   we may to appearance be more affected with outward benefits, because
   fleshly objects do more work upon our fleshly senses, as carrying a
   greater suitableness to them. Religion is a grave, severe thing, not
   seen so much in actual transports, as in the habitual complacency and
   well-pleasedness of the mind: yet in solemn duties there may be as
   great ravishment of soul: Ps. lxiii. 5, My soul shall be ravished as
   with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
   lips.' When they feel the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, they
   are in effect transported with it, more than with all the delicates and
   banquets of the world, and cannot hold from praising God. But generally
   it must be measured by our solid complacency and judicious esteem. What
   we prize most, and would least want, and would not forego for all other
   things; so the saints rejoice in God and Christ more than in any
   worldly matter whatsoever: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but
   thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee;' Ps.
   cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in
   all riches;' Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many that say, Who will show us any
   good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us; thou hast
   put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and
   their wine increased;' Ps. lxiii. 3, Because thy loving-kindness is
   better than life, my lips shall praise thee.' This is that which they
   love most, and keep best, and are most loth to want. This is that which
   giveth a value to life itself; and without which that which is most
   precious and desirable is little or nothing worth; and giveth them more
   comfort than what is most comfortable in this world; and is the most
   cheerful employment for their thoughts to think upon. This is delight
   in Christ.

   II. Whether this may be had without assurance? And can those who are
   dark in their interest in Christ, and know not whether they have any
   grace or no, rejoice in him? To this I answer, Yes, certainly; for
   there are general grounds of rejoicing, for the gospel bringeth glad
   tidings to sinners, as it offereth to them a way how to escape out of
   their misery, and enter into the peace of God.

   But more distinctly:--

   1. The scripture speaketh of a twofold rejoicing in Christ--before
   faith and after faith. Before faith is full-grown and is but in the
   making, as those, Acts xiii. 48, When they heard this, they were glad,'
   &c.; and he that had found the true treasure, for joy thereof sold all
   that he had, Mat. xiii. 44. There was joy before the thorough
   consent--though introductive of it, yet antecedent to it. And the
   reason is, because God hath showed them the way how to free themselves
   from misery, and to enjoy true felicity and happiness. Now, if there
   may be a joy before faith, certainly before assurance. The very offer
   of a remedy is comfortable when in misery. And then there is a joy
   after faith, as joy and peace in believing, when they take the course
   to get this liberty and deliverance by Christ; yet this is faith, not
   assurance. As a sick man, when he heareth of an able physician who hath
   cured many of the same disease wherewith he is oppressed, he rejoiceth,
   and conceiveth some hope that he maybe cured also. When he hath lighted
   upon this physician, and beginneth to make use of his healing
   medicines, he is more glad, and expecteth the cure. But when he is
   perfectly recovered, and feeleth it, then he is glad indeed. So when a
   broken-hearted creature heareth the glad tidings of the gospel, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, he rejoiceth that God
   hath found out such a Saviour to recover the lapsed estate of mankind.
   But when he submitteth to Christ's healing methods, and trusts himself
   with his skill and fidelity, he is more comforted, and doth more
   intimately feel the benefit of this course in his own soul; but as he
   groweth more assured of his health and salvation, his comfort still
   increaseth, and his joy is more unspeakable and glorious. So that this
   joy may be without assurance, for the causes of it at first are
   knowledge and faith.

   2. There is a joy that accompanieth seeking, even before we attain what
   we seek after: Ps. cv. 3, Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the
   Lord.' There is a great deal of contentment in this course, though that
   complacential joy which is our full reward be yet reserved for us. Yet
   there is a joy in seeking; better be a seeker than a wanderer. This
   blessed Saviour am I waiting upon! Though we have attained to little
   communion with him, yet it is a comfort that we are seeking farther
   measure. Delight and joy keepeth up our endeavours.

   3. When our right is cleared, then we have more abundant joy: 2 Pet. i.
   10, 11, Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
   calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, you shall never
   fall. For so an entrance shall be administered to you abundantly into
   the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.' Some are
   afar off, others not far from the kingdom of God; others make a hard
   shift to go to heaven through many doubts and fears, some sail into the
   haven of glory with full sails, with much joy and peace of soul

   III. I shall show you the spiritual profit of this joy.

   1. It is such a joy as doth enlarge our heart in duty, and strengthens
   us in. the way of God: Neh. viii. 10, The joy of the Lord is your
   strength.' There is a natural deadness and dulness in holy duties,
   which we often find in ourselves, which cometh to pass partly from the
   back-bias of corruption, weakening our delight in God, and partly from
   the remissness of our will towards spiritual and heavenly things. Now,
   the most proper and kindly cure of it is this delight and rejoicing in
   Christ; for a man will readily do those things which he delighteth in,
   though toilsome and difficult. Let the heart be but affected with the
   grace of Christ, and our joy will soon vent itself in a thankful and
   delightful obedience: 1 John v. 3, For this is the love of God, that we
   keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous;' Ps.
   cxix. 14, I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
   all riches;' Ps. xl. 8, I delight to do thy will, my God; yea, thy law
   is within my heart.' The hardest services are pleasant to one that
   delighteth in Christ; they are sweetened by his love, and quickened and
   enlivened by the sense and esteem that we have of the benefits he
   procureth for us. Shall we refuse to do anything for such a
   compassionate Saviour, who died for us to reconcile us to God, and
   bring us to the everlasting fruition of him? So that the life of all
   obedience dependeth on this joy.

   2. It is our cordial to fortify us against all the calamities and
   infelicities of the present world, and maketh every bitter thing sweet
   to us, whether they be the common afflictions incident to man, or
   persecutions for righteousness' sake.

   [1.] For the common afflictions. A Christian is never in a right frame
   till he hath learned contentment in all estates; that he doth not
   overjoy in worldly comforts, nor overgrieve for worldly losses, 1 Cor,
   vii. 30, but carrieth himself as one that is above the hopes and fears
   of the world. Now, there are many means to be used that we may get this
   humble and composed frame of heart; but the most constant and effectual
   cure of worldly sorrow is to keep our rejoicing in Jesus Christ, and to
   be satisfied with the fruits of his redemption. This, like the wood
   that was cast in at Marah to make the bitter waters sweet, doth sweeten
   our troubles, and supply our wants, and swallow up our griefs and
   infelicities; for we have that in Christ which is better than the
   natural comfort taken from us: Hab. iii. 17, 18, Although the fig-tree
   shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of
   the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock
   shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
   stalls; yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
   salvation.' He supposeth not only some want, but an utter destitution
   and desolation of all things, and yet his heart was kept up by joy in
   God. So elsewhere, Rom. xii. 12, Rejoicing in hope, patient in
   tribulation, continuing instant in prayer.' The comfort of
   reconciliation with God, and the hopes of heaven, do most breed
   patience in afflictions. And, certainly, joy is the best cure of
   sorrow; contraria contrariis curantur. Now, the joy that must be
   opposed to worldly sorrow is not worldly, but either spiritual or
   heavenly joy. Spiritual in the present fruits of Christ's death: Heb.
   xii. 11, Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
   grievous; nevertheless, afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.' Heavenly; surely
   eternal joys will best vanquish temporal sorrows: Heb. xii. 2, Looking
   unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that
   was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set
   down at the right hand of the throne of God.' This will enable us
   patiently and cheerfully to bear all things.

   [2.] Persecutions. We need to be fortified against this, that we may
   boldly profess our faith in Christ, without any fear of sufferings, and
   may not faint under them, but bear them with courage and constancy Now,
   this is the fruit of this rejoicing in Christ; witness these
   scriptures: Acts v. 41, They went away rejoicing that they were counted
   worthy to suffer shame for his name;' Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the
   spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a
   better and an enduring substance.' So Mat. v. 12, Rejoice, and be
   exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted
   they the prophets which were before you;' and in many other places; and
   1 Peter iv. 13, Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
   sufferings; that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also
   with an exceeding joy;' and James i. 2, Count it all joy, when ye fall
   into divers trials.' Surely, Christ and heaven are worth something, and
   such. trials do in part show how much we esteem him, and value him
   above any interest of ours.

   3. It doth draw off the heart from the delights of the flesh. Not only
   contraria contrariis curantur, but similia similibus. Carnal pleasures
   put the soul out of relish with better things, and draw off the heart
   from God. A fleshly mind is easily blinded and enchanted with worldly
   vanities; therefore, it concerneth us to check our inclination to
   sense-pleasing and flesh-pleasing, which is so natural to us. How shall
   it be cured but by seeking our delight elsewhere? Every man must have
   some oblectation, for love cannot lie idle in the soul; either his love
   is taken up with the joys of sense or the joys of faith--with vain
   pleasures or with chaste and spiritual delights. The one spoileth the
   taste of the other. A spiritual mind, that is feasted with higher
   delights, cannot relish the garlick, and onions, and flesh-pots of
   Egypt: Cant. i. 4, We will remember thy loves more than wine.' And a
   brutish heart, that is wholly lost and sunk in these dreggy
   contentments which gratify sense, valueth not the favour of God,
   thinketh it canting to talk of communion with him, and the joys of hope
   to be fantastical expressions. They love pleasures more than God, 2
   Tim. iii. 4. Now, if we would restrain and check this inclination, we
   should rejoice in Christ, and delight our minds and hearts in the
   remembrance of his love and benefits. Whatever pleasure a man doth find
   or imagine to find in sensual, fleshly courses, that and much more is
   to be had in Christ, where we rejoice at a surer and more sincere rate:
   Eph. v. 4, Not jesting, but rather giving of thanks.' Carnal mirth doth
   not so cheer worldlings as the remembrance of the favours and blessings
   we have by Christ. Keep the heart thankful and sensible of God's
   goodness and Christ's love, and you will not need vain delights. So
   Eph. v. 18, Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled
   with the Spirit.' These are motives and marks also, for by these three
   things you may know whether you have this joy, yea or no.

   IV. The helps or means by which this joy is raised in us.

   1. A sense of sin and misery. This maketh you more sensible of the
   mercy of the deliverance, and to be more affected with it, as the
   grievousness of a disease maketh the recovery more delightful. The law
   condemned you, his ransom must absolve you; sin made you dead, his
   grace quickeneth and puts life into you. Always as our sense of misery
   is, so is the sense of the recovery; if one be bitter, the other is
   sweet. None prize and esteem Christ so much as the broken-hearted and
   burdened.

   2. An entire confidence in Christ: for so it followeth, Have no
   confidence in the flesh.' If we have no confidence in the flesh, and
   look for all from the mercy and bounty of God through Christ, we shall
   prize him: 1 Peter ii. 7, Unto you therefore which believe, he is
   precious;' Phil. iii. 8, Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but
   loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.'

   3. A constant use of the means whereby this joy may be fed and in
   creased in us; as the word, sacraments, and prayer, The word: Ps. cxix.
   102, I have not departed from thy judgments, for thou hast taught me.'
   Then prayer, suing out of our right: John xvi. 24, Ask, and ye shall
   receive, that your joy may be full.' So for the sacraments; baptism:
   Acts viii. 39, When they were come up out of the water, the Spirit
   caught away Philip, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on
   his way rejoicing.' The Lord's Supper; it is our spiritual refection.

   4. Sincerity of obedience: 1 Cor. v. 8, Therefore let us keep the
   feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and
   wickedness; but with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth.'
   Practical delight is the chiefest, above that of contemplation, a more
   intimate sense.

   We come now to the last part of a Christian's character: And have no
   confidence in the flesh. To understand it, consider there are two
   things called flesh in scripture.

   1. External privileges belonging to the worldly life; such as wealth,
   greatness, and worldly honour. Now to glory in these is to glory in the
   flesh, and to trust in these is to trust in the flesh, which should be
   far from Christians: Jer. ix. 23, 24, Let not the wise man glory in his
   wisdom, nor the mighty man glory in his might. Let not the rich man
   glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
   knoweth me, that I am the Lord,' &c. Where the prophet laboureth to
   beat them off from their vain confidences, that they might not rely
   upon their power, policy, and wealth, but a saving knowledge of and
   interest in God, whose goodness and faithfulness could only secure them
   against all evils, and procure them all manner of blessings.

   2. The outward duties and performances of religion, especially the
   ceremonies of Moses. Those, consisting in external observances, are
   called flesh; and to have confidence in the flesh is to place our
   confidence in external privileges and duties. For the apostle
   explaineth himself, ver. 4, Though I might also have confidence in the
   flesh: if any other man thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I
   more.' He was not any whit inferior to any of the Judaizing brethren in
   outward privileges and duties; yea, had greater cause of glorying in
   the flesh than any of the pretenders among them. And then instances, in
   his Jewish privileges, circumcision, his family, his sect--a pharisee;
   his partial obedience or external righteousness--as to the law
   blameless.' To rest on these things, then, for our acceptance with God
   is to have confidence in the flesh. And elsewhere he saith, Gal. iii.
   3, Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh?'
   when they reverted to the ceremonies of the law. This is called flesh,
   because they consist in outward things. Corrupt nature is pleased with
   such things, and doth plead and stand for them.

   Doct. That a good Christian doth not place his hope and confidence of
   acceptance with God in external privileges and performances.

   In the first character, a Christian is described by his worship; in the
   second, by his joy; in the third, by his confidence.

   In handling this point, I shall show you:--

   I. What are these externals which are apt to tempt men to a vain
   confidence.

   II. That naturally men are for a mere external way of serving God, and
   place their whole confidence therein.

   III. Why a good Christian should have no confidence in this external
   conformity to God's law.

   I. What are these externals in religion which are apt to tempt men to a
   vain confidence? They may be referred to two heads: they are either
   commanded by God or invented by man--God's externals or man's
   externals.

   1. God's externals: such as he hath instituted and appointed, either in
   the law of Moses or in the law of Christ. In the law of Moses, such as
   circumcision, with all the appendent rites. These are called, Heb. ix.
   10, Carnal ordinances, imposed on them till the time of reformation.'
   These were to be observed while the institution of them was in force
   and stood unrepealed, which was done at the coming of Christ: John iv.
   23, 24, The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
   worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such
   to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship
   him in spirit and in truth.' These made great trouble in the infancy of
   the church, for the Jews and Judaizing Christians were loth to depart
   from the rituals under which they were bred and brought up, though
   Christ fully evidenced his commission from heaven to repeal those laws,
   and his apostles strongly pleaded the ancient prophecies which foretold
   it But these are of no more concernment to us, except to direct us how
   to behave ourselves in like cases.

   2. There are externals in the law of Christ, such as the
   sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper; hearing of the word,
   external prayer, and the like. Now the rule is that they must be used,
   but the outward act not rested in as a sufficient ground of our
   acceptance with God. Used they must be in faith and obedience, because
   God hath instituted them under great penalties. As circumcision, while
   the command was in force: Gen. xvii. 14, The man-child whose flesh is
   not circumcised shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my
   covenant;' so baptism: Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth and is baptized
   shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' Not want,
   but neglect or contempt. Therefore, all these duties must be used as
   means of salvation, and as expressions of the inward truth of our faith
   in God and obedience to him. We must not cast off ordinances, but yet
   they must not be rested in as sufficient grounds of our acceptance with
   God. While circumcision was in force, they relied on it, as it
   distinguished them from other nations as the genuine seed of Abraham,
   and so reckoned to be within the covenant. But the servants of God did
   always disprove [6] this vain confidence: Rom. ii. 28, 29, He is not a
   Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is
   outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and
   circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter,
   whose praise is not of men but of God.' They rejoiced in a shadow when
   they wanted the thing signified, if there were no mortification of sin,
   or putting off the body of the sins of the flesh. But not only the
   apostle, but the prophet long before disproveth [7] their vain
   confidence: Jer. ix. 25, 26, Behold, the days come when I will punish
   them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; Egypt and Edom, with
   the children of Ammon and Moab, are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the
   house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart,' God would proceed against
   wicked persons and people, circumcised as well as uncircumcised. Were
   those things spoken to them only, and not to us also? Surely all may
   learn from hence that by a bare submission to outward rites we are not
   approved of God, without minding the true reformation of heart and
   life, and expecting the pardon of our sins by Jesus Christ. You are
   baptized, but are you washed from your sins? You hear the word, but is
   it the power of God to your salvation? You frequent sacraments, but is
   the conscience of the bond of the holy oath into which you are entered
   upon your hearts? There is more required in Christianity than outward
   profession, whether in word or deed--namely, the conscience of your
   dedication to God--or else the work doth not go deep enough: 1 Cor.
   xiii. 3, Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
   give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
   nothing.' You content yourselves with your tale and number of duties,
   praying morning and evening, and reading so many chapters; but where is
   the spirit and the fruit of all that you do? They that are given to
   fasting think themselves very devout if they fast often, be their
   hearts never so full of rancour. Many huddle over many prayers, but
   they do not go from their heavenly Father with a heavenly mind. They
   give alms, but live loosely. As Michal laid a statue in David's bed,
   and covering it with David's apparel, made Saul's messengers believe it
   was David himself sick in bed; so many persons cover themselves with
   certain external actions belonging to religion, and the world believeth
   them truly sanctified and spiritual, whenas, indeed, they are but
   statues and apparitions of devotion to God. But this is but a vain
   show, a placing the means instead of the end--the subordinate instead
   of the ultimate end.

   2. Man's externals, invented by themselves, by laws of their own, and
   outward observances of their own devising. Men's whole religion running
   out into externals, they are not contented with the forms of worship
   instituted by God, but add somewhat of their own, and love to bind
   themselves in chains of their own making: as the Jews, not being
   perfect as appertaining to the conscience, by the use of the instituted
   ceremonies of Moses, invented other things to make them more perfect.

   Now, as to this, I shall only observe:--

   [1.] That as the outside of worship is most minded by a carnal
   Christian, so the inside by a renewed Christian: Mat. xv. 8, This
   people draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their
   lips; but their heart is far from me.' Their hearts are averse from
   God. The carnal Christian is all for uncovering the head, and bowing
   the knee, but taketh no care of the heart: Isa. lviii. 5, Is it such a
   fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to
   bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under
   him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day unto the Lord?'
   The pharisees were zealous for washing before meat, as if it were an
   holy religious act, because it was one of their own traditions, Mat.
   xv. 2, but took no notice of inward defilement.

   [2.] They are more zealous for human inventions than moral and
   commanded duties, Mat. xv. 3, 4--for the rudiments of the world, as the
   apostle calleth them, Col. ii. 8, than the unquestionable ordinances of
   Christ; for a worldly religion must be supported by worldly means.

   [3.] I observe, that the more external pomp there is of man's devising,
   the less spiritual truth; for it gratifieth the natural corruption,
   which is all for the outside. Some few externals God intended for an
   help, but when men will be adding, they become a burden and an
   impediment. God did not abrogate his own ceremonies for men to appoint
   theirs.

   II. That naturally men are merely for an external way of serving God,
   and place their confidence therein.

   Here I shall show you:--

   1. That their hearts are set upon external worship.

   2. That therein they place all their confidence.

   1. That naturally men's hearts are chiefly set upon external services;
   and that--

   [1.] Out of laziness; externals being more easy than worship ping God
   in the spirit: Mat. xxiii. 23, They tithe mint, and anise, and cummin,
   but omit the weightier things of the law, ta` baru'tera tou no'mou,
   judgment, mercy, faith.' Conscience is like the stomach, which
   naturally desireth to fill itself, and when it cannot digest solid
   food, filleth itself only with wind. So here, outward things are more
   easy, but mortifying sin, and solid godliness, is more difficult; this
   the natural man cannot digest, and therefore culleth out the easier and
   cheaper sort of religion, which puts him to no great trouble or
   self-denial.

   [2.] Out of their indulgence to the flesh. A man can spare anything
   better than his lusts, his estate, the present ease of the body, their
   children, anything for the sin of their souls, Micah vi. 6-8. The
   question is not how to satisfy justice, but how to appease conscience,
   while they retain their sins. They would buy out their peace with vast
   sums of money, mangle their flesh, like the priests of Baal, to spare
   the sin of their souls, do anything, endure anything, but the subduing
   the heart to God. The sensual nature of man is such, that he is loth to
   be crossed; if he must be crossed, only a little, and but for a while;
   and therefore affects an easy religion, where the flesh is not crossed,
   or but a little crossed. Now, slight duties performed now and then do
   not much trouble the flesh, where there is no mortifying of lusts, no
   serious godliness.

   [3.] Out of pride. Man is a proud creature, and would fain establish
   his own righteousness, and have somewhat wherein to glory in himself,
   Rom. x. 3. A russet coat of our own is better than a silken garment
   that is borrowed of another: Luke xviii. 9, Christ spake this parable
   against those who trusted in themselves that they were righteous.'
   There is such a disposition in men, that if by any means they can hold
   up a pretence of righteousness of their own, will not pray, and wait,
   and consecrate, and devote themselves to God, that they may attain his
   righteousness, if they have anything to plead, if they have a partial
   righteousness, if they be not to be numbered among the worst of men:
   Luke xviii. 11, The pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I
   thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
   adulterers, or even as this publican.' If they have an external
   righteousness, they will plead that, I fast twice in the week, I give
   tithe of all that I possess,' &c. A legal spirit is natural to us.
   Though men dare not pretend to a universal conformity to the law in a
   strict sense, yet, if they can make a shift to get any external
   conformity to the law, they are confident of divine acceptance. Yea, so
   sottish is their conscience, that they will catch hold of anything:
   Judges xvii. 13, Now I know God will bless me, because I have a Levite
   to my priest,' giving him meat and drink, and about fifty shillings per
   annum! So willing are we to justify ourselves, by some thing in
   ourselves, or done by ourselves. Therefore, that the ell may be no
   broader than the cloth, they devise a short exposition of the law, that
   they may entertain a large opinion of their own righteousness.

   [4.] There is another reason--interest. External forms of religion draw
   an interest after them, therefore the apostle saith, Rom. ii. 29, Whose
   praise is not of men, but of God;' and Gal. i. 10, If I yet please men,
   I were not the servant of Christ.' And rudiments of the world,' Col.
   ii. 8. It maketh a man to be applauded and countenanced by the world.
   Let a man betake himself to such a religion, there are those which will
   back him and stand by him, and their disfavour and displeasure he shall
   incur if he forsake it. And where the false worshippers are the
   prevailing party, he runneth great hazard by contradicting such form
   and opinions. Therefore the heart of that man that is set on externals
   takes up with the religion of his country, whether true or false.

   2. They place their confidence therein. Every man that hath a
   conscience must have something to trust unto. Now, what feedeth his
   confidence but the religion which he hath chosen? There are two things
   which detain men from God and Christ: some false imaginary happiness,
   and some counterfeit righteousness, wherein they please themselves. The
   false happiness is as their God, and the counterfeit righteousness is
   as their Christ and mediator, and so they are secure and senseless;
   and, until God open their eyes, they neither seek after another
   righteousness, nor trouble themselves about the way whereby they may
   attain it. That men set a false happiness is evident, for ever since
   man fell from God he ran to the creature, Jer. ii. 13, left the
   fountain for the cistern; and if we can make a shift to patch up a
   sorry happiness apart from God, we never care for him, or will not come
   at him, Jer. ii. 31. Our pleasure, our profit, our honour, that is our
   God. And if we can enjoy these things without any rubs and checks, we
   look no farther, and will not seek our happiness in an invisible God,
   nor wait to enjoy it in an invisible world. But the second error is,
   that there is something instead of Christ to us, to keep the conscience
   quiet Our happiness is to satisfy our desires, our righteousness to
   allay our fears. Now here we run to a superficial religion, or
   something external, which is diversified according to men's
   education--pagans to the e'rgon no'mou, Rom. ii. 15, Jews to the
   observances of the law, Christians to baptism, outward profession, or
   some strict form without the power, under which we shelter ourselves,
   and by which we bolster up our confidence, till God convince us of our
   mistakes. And so Christ and his renewing and reconciling grace is
   neglected and disregarded, certainly not cordially accepted as our
   Redeemer and Saviour.

   I come now to show:--

   III. Why a good Christian should have no confidence in the flesh.

   1. Because till we are dead to the law we cannot live to God. Now, to
   be dead to the law is nothing else but to have our confidence in the
   flesh, or external righteousness, mortified. You hear often of being
   dead to sin, and dead to the world; you must be also dead to the law,
   or otherwise you cannot live in Christ, and bring forth fruit unto God:
   Gal. ii. 19, For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live
   unto God;' and Rom. vii. 4, By the body of Christ ye are become dead to
   the law; that ye may be married to another, even to him who is raised
   from the dead.' We grow dead to the law, when thereby we understand our
   sinful miserable estate without Christ, and how unable we are to help
   ourselves. By the convincing power of the law we know our sins; by the
   condemning power of the law we know the misery and curse we are subject
   unto; by the irritating power of the law we find that the righteousness
   which the law requireth is not in us, nor can it be found in us. Now in
   one of those places we are said by the law to be dead to the law, and
   in the other, by the body of Christ. By the law itself we are said to
   be dead to the law, as it maketh us to despair of righteousness by that
   covenant. By the body of Christ (that is, by the crucified body, or
   death of Christ), so we are dead to the law, as we are invited to a
   better hope or covenant, which Christ hath established by bearing our
   sins on his body on the tree, or enduring the curse of the law for us.
   Be it by the one, or the other, or both, none will value the grace of
   Christ till they be dead to the law. Men will shift as long as they can
   patch up a sorry righteousness of their own, mingle covenants, turn one
   into another, make one of both, chop, change, mangle, and cut short the
   law of God; do anything rather than come upon their knees and beg terms
   of grace in a serious and broken hearted manner. None can partake of
   Christ but those that have their legal confidence mortified, who are
   first driven, then drawn to him. None but they who are convinced of sin
   fly to Christ for righteousness; none but they who are left obnoxious
   to wrath and the curse prize his delivering us from wrath to come; none
   but those who are made sensible of their impotency will seek after his
   renewing grace, but will still keep to their base shifts, mingling and
   blending covenants, resting in a little superficial righteousness, or
   half-covenant of works, or mingling a little grace with it; are not
   brought in a humble, penitent, and broken-hearted manner, to sue out
   their pardon in the name of Christ, and so regularly to pass from
   covenant to covenant.

   2. The superficial righteousness doth not only keep men from Christ,
   but set them against Christ, his way, his servants, and true interest
   in the world. These were dogs, evil-workers, to whom the apostle
   opposeth the true Christians. Usually they that are for the form,
   oppose the power: Gal. iv. 29, He that was born after the flesh,
   persecuted him that was born after the Spirit.' They that have but the
   form and shadow of godliness, no more than the power of nature carrieth
   them unto, will persecute those that have the reality and truth,--that
   is, the renewing and reconciling grace of Jesus Christ; partly, because
   the true spiritual worshippers, by their serious godliness, disgrace
   and condemn those that lazily rest in an empty form; and therefore they
   cannot endure them. At the bottom of their hearts they have an enmity
   and hatred against God, and vent it on his people: 1 John iii. 12, Not
   as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother; and
   wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his
   brother's righteous.' Partly, because there is in them a spirit of envy
   and emulation; both are rivals for the favour of God. The spiritual
   worshippers take the right way, and the formalists the wrong way to
   obtain it; the first are received, the latter rejected. And they being
   at such great pains and costs in their wrong way, cannot endure that
   any should be preferred before them; witness Cain and Abel. Where
   carnal confidence is, there is bitterness of spirit against sincerity.

   3. Because they have so much to do with God. They that look to men, may
   rest in an outward appearance; but one whose business lieth mainly with
   God, must look to the frame of his heart, that it be right set towards
   holiness. Now this is the course of a thorough Christian. It is God's
   wrath that he feareth, God's favour that is his life and happiness,
   God's presence into which he often cometh, God's mercy from whom he
   expecteth his reward, and with God he hopeth to live for ever. Now,
   bare externals are of no account or worth with God: John iv. 24, God is
   a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in
   truth;' 1 Sam. xvi. 7, But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not on his
   countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I have refused
   him; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man looketh on the
   outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart;' Prov. xvi. 2,
   All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth
   the spirit.' Men judge after the outward appearance, but God weigheth
   the spirits.

   4. Because of the nature of gospel worship, which is simple, spiritual,
   and substantial; therefore called spirit, often in opposition to the
   ceremonies of the law, and the ministration of the spirit unto life, 2
   Cor. iii. 8. The law is called letter, and the gospel spirit. Now, for
   a Christian to turn the ordinances of Christ into flesh, which were
   appointed to be the ministration of the Spirit, this is to alter the
   nature of things, and turn the gospel, by which is all our claim and
   hope, into a dead letter.

   5. This confidence should not be cherished by a Christian, because it
   can bring no solid peace to the conscience, for the present external
   justiciaries are uncertain. The man that kept all these things from his
   youth, saith, What lack I yet?' Mat. xix. 20. He asketh as a man
   unsatisfied; for our bondage doth not wear off with external duties,
   but is increased rather till we are justified in the name of Christ,
   and sanctified by his Spirit. But suppose it satisfieth blind
   conscience for the present, yet afterwards, men whose hearts are not
   found in God's statutes, fall into sad complaints, and are involved in
   a maze and labyrinth of doubts and troubles, whence they know not how
   to extricate themselves. They have so much sense of religion as to
   understand their duty, and yet are so little brought under the power of
   it, as not to be able to make out their claim. But if this be not the
   case of all, when the hour of death cometh, we shall find all is but
   froth, 1 Cor. v. 5, 6. If we have not minded the Redeemer's grace, his
   whole grace, the imputation of his righteousness, and the regeneration
   of his Spirit, and lived in obedience to his sanctifying motions, then
   we shall be filled with horror and amazement.

   The first use is caution. Take heed of having confidence in the flesh,
   of placing religion, and valuing your interest in God, by external
   observances; but look to this, that your hearts be upright with God in
   the new covenant. To this end:--

   1. Take heed of a false happiness. The wisdom of the flesh, which is
   natural to us, doth incline us to it, James iii. 15, doth only prompt
   us to pleasure, profit, and honour. We set our hearts on vain delights,
   and are wholly carried to them, value our happiness by them. Whilst we
   indulge this sensual inclination, the soul careth not for God, other
   things are set up instead of God. The belly is god: Phil. iii. 19,
   Whose God is their belly,' Mammon is their god, Mat. vi. 24. And honour
   and worldly greatness is another idol which men set up, while they
   value the praise of men more than the praise of God, John xii. 43.
   Carnal self-love maketh idols, and sets up other gods instead of the
   true God. Now therefore make it your first work to return to God as
   your rightful lord and chief happiness, as your sovereign lord. If you
   make it your business and purpose to worship God in the spirit, you
   will rejoice in Christ, and have no confidence in the flesh. Spiritual
   worship convinceth us of defects, and you will see a need of Christ's
   renewing and reconciling grace. Our treasure and happiness is our god.
   Now therefore do you value your happiness by the favour of God, and not
   by worldly things?

   2. In the next place, take heed of a superficial righteousness; for
   this is plain confidence in the flesh. This maketh you senseless and
   ignorant of your danger, and careless of the means of your recovery,
   and so your conviction and conversion is more difficult. And therefore
   Christ saith, that publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of God
   before pharisees and self-justiciaries, Mat. xxi. 31. No condition is
   more dangerous than to be poor and proud; corrupt, and yet conceited
   and confident. The most vicious are sooner wrought upon than those that
   please themselves in external observances, without real internal
   holiness or change of heart.

   This is twofold:--

   1. Outward ordinances.

   2. Partial morality.

   1. Outward ordinances: to rest in your attendance upon and use of
   these. Consider how displeased God was with those that submitted to
   sacraments without reformation: 1 Cor. x. 1-5, With many of them God
   was not well pleased, but they were overthrown in the wilderness.'
   Spiritual meat and spiritual drink could not keep them from destruction
   when they murmured, when they fell from Christ to idolatry, when they
   lusted after quails, when they tempted Christ; and will he be more
   favourable to you? Oh, rest not then in the outward use of the
   ordinances of Christ! God may vouchsafe you this favour, and yet not be
   well pleased with you. Many that have eaten and drunk in his presence,
   yet are finally rejected for their sins, Luke xiii. 26. Many prize the
   seal, yet tear the bond; that is, break the covenant, yet seem to value
   the seal of the covenant, that they may have confidence in the flesh,
   in the bare external performance.

   2. Partial morality: those that live fairly and plausibly, but want the
   true principle, the spirit of Christ; the true rule, the word of God;
   the true end, the glory of God; that are in with one duty and out with
   another; fail in their duties to God or men; are much in worship, but
   defective in common righteousness; love friends, but cannot forgive
   enemies; it may be they will forgive wrongs, but make no conscience of
   paying debts. Now there are two arguments against these: these neither
   understand the law nor the gospel; not the law, its strictness, purity,
   and spiritual exactness; nor the gospel, which offereth a remedy only
   to the penitent, those who are deeply affected with the pollution of
   their natures, the sins of their lives, and the consequent misery; but
   those that are puffed up with a vain conceit of the goodness of their
   estate, without any brokenness of heart.

   [1.] They are injurious to the law, as they curtail it and reduce it to
   the external work, Gal. iv. 20. Ye that desire to be under the law,
   hear what the law saith; if you will stand to that covenant, do you
   know what it is? The duty is impossible, Rom. viii. 3. The penalty is
   intolerable, for the law worketh wrath;' and it is a law of sin and
   death to the fallen creature, Rom. viii. 2. The curse is very dreadful
   and terrible. Nothing more opposite to the law than this partial
   righteousness. The law, well understood, would humble them.

   [2.] This resting in a partial external righteousness is also opposite
   to the gospel, which inviteth us in a broken-hearted manner to accept
   Christ. He came to call sinners, not those who are righteous in their
   own eyes, Mat. ix. 13. It is a remedy for lost sinners, not for them
   that need no repentance: Luke xv. 7, I say unto you, that likewise joy
   shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
   ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance.' Nothing is more
   opposite to the gospel than this confidence in the flesh. The woman
   that was a sinner was preferred before Simon a pharisee, Luke vii. 44;
   and the self-condemning publican before the self-justifying pharisee,
   Luke xviii. 13; the penitent adulteress before her accusers, John viii.
   The most despised sinners, repenting and believing in Christ, find more
   grace and place with him than those that satisfy themselves with some
   external conformities.

   A second use is by way of examination. Are you of this temper, that you
   have no confidence in the flesh?

   If you are:--

   1. You are still kept humble and thankful; humble, with a sense of sin
   and deserved wrath; confessing and forsaking your sins, and glorying in
   Christ only, you are kept vile in your own eyes, and in a humble
   admiration of grace: Luke vii. 47, Wherefore I say unto you, her sins,
   which are many, are forgiven her, for she loved much,' &c. She loved
   much, because much was forgiven. When God is pacified, yet you loathe
   yourselves: Ezek. xvi. 63, That thou mayest remember and be confounded,
   and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am
   pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord
   God.' And you ascribe all to the mercy of God and the merit of Christ;
   blessing God for him and imploring pardon for your best duties, our
   righteousness being but as filthy rags.

   2. A partial outside obedience will not satisfy you. A heart that
   findeth rest in empty formal services certainly places confidence in
   the flesh. They neither look after the change of their natures, nor
   their reconciliation with God by Christ. They challenge God: Isa.
   lviii. 3, Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
   wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?'
   and Luke xviii. 12, I fast twice in the week, and I give tithe of all
   that I possess.'

   3. Thankfulness or gratitude sets you awork for God, rather than a
   legal conscience. Duties are performed as a thank-offering rather than
   a sin-offering, out of love to God rather than fear.

WHAT KIND OF PERFECTION IS ATTAINABLE IN THIS LIFE?

   Let, therefore, as many as be perfect be thus minded; and if in any
   thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
   you.--Phil. III. 15.

   THESE words are inferred out of the foregoing context, as the illative
   particle therefore showeth.

   In the words are two things:--

   1. His exhortation to the strong and grown Christian: Let us therefore,
   as many as be perfect, be thus minded.

   2. His condescension to the weak: And if in anything ye be otherwise
   minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

   In the former branch we have:--

   1. The term by which the strong Christian is expressed: As many as be
   perfect.' He had said before of himself that he was not yet perfect,
   ver. 12. Yet now he supposeth it both of himself and others: Let us
   therefore, as many as be perfect.' Therefore perfection must be taken
   in a limited sense, to avoid the seeming contradiction.

   2. The advice or counsel given, Be thus minded;' what is that? touto
   phroneite, Think the same thing with me.' What that is must be known by
   the foregoing context, and may be gathered from the third verse. He had
   spoken of some false teachers and Judaizing brethren, who gave out
   themselves to be patrons and defenders of the circumcision, and other
   ceremonies of the law, as if these things did commend them to God. Now
   the apostle reproveth them, and saith they were not peritome`, the
   circumcision,' but katatome`, the concision,' destroyers and renders of
   the church, not the true people of God, who were sometimes noted by the
   term circumcision. They are the concision, the cutters and dividers of
   the church; but we are peritome`, the true circumcision, who serve God
   in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in
   the flesh;' that is, who have no confidence in any superficial
   righteousness, but seek our justification before God, and the
   renovation of our natures from Christ alone; and serve God by
   exercising this grace in faith, love, and hope; or who seek to Christ
   alone for his renewing and reconciling grace, that we may serve God in
   a spiritual manner, and so at length attain the promised glory. Now
   this he proveth by his own instance, who had as much cause to glory in
   the flesh as any of them, but suffered the loss of all things, and
   counted all things wherein they gloried, and he might have gloried, but
   loss and dung, that he might obtain this grace from Christ Jesus, and
   at length, after a diligent, self-denying course of service and
   obedience, be brought home to God. Now, saith he, As many as be
   perfect, touto phroneite, mind this,' take care of this, and do you,
   with the loss of all things, press to this.

   3. His condescension to the weak, who were not satisfied with the
   abrogation of the ceremonies of the law, though they had embraced other
   parts and points of Christianity: And if in anything ye be otherwise
   minded, God shall reveal even this to you.' Here--

   [1.] Something is supposed, that they should not be cut off from the
   rest of Christians, either by the harsh censures or rigorous dealing of
   the strong, or the pertinacious obstinacy of the weak. The perfect,
   that have the truth of their side, must not condemn others; nor the
   weak must not condemn and censure them.

   [2.] Something expressed, or the reason of this mutual condescension
   and forbearance. If they be sincere and humble, God will at length show
   them the truth.

   I begin with his counsel to the strong and grown Christian; and there I
   shall speak, first, of the term by which they are expressed: Let as
   many of us as be perfect.'

   Doct. That there is a kind of perfection attainable in this life.

   I shall, first, explain the point by several distinctions.

   Secondly, prove that all Christians should endeavour to be perfect.

   For the first, there is a double perfection: perfectio termini et
   præmii, and perfectio viæ seu cognitionis et sanctitatis--a perfection
   of the reward, and a perfection of grace.

   1. Of the reward which the saints shall have in heaven, where they are
   freed from all sinful weakness: 1 Cor. xiii. 10, When that which is
   perfect shall come, then that which is in part shall be done away.' In
   heaven there is perfect felicity and exact holiness; then the saints
   are glorious saints indeed, when they have neither spot, nor wrinkle,
   nor blemish, nor any such thing, Eph. v. 27; when presented faultless
   before the presence of his glory,' Jude 24. Now this we have not in the
   world; but because this we expect in the other world, we are to labour
   after the highest perfection in holiness here, because allowed
   imperfection is a disesteem of blessedness. Do we count immaculate
   purity and perfection in holiness to be our blessedness hereafter? and
   shall we shun it, and fly from it, or at least neglect it, as if it
   were our burden now? No surely! He that hath this hope in him purifieth
   himself, as Christ is pure,' 1 John iii. 3. He that looketh not for a
   Turkish paradise, but a sinless estate, will endeavour it now, get as
   much as he can of it now. When you cease to grow in holiness you cease
   to go on any farther to salvation; you seem to be out of love with
   heaven and blessedness when your desires and endeavours are slaked.

   2. The perfection of grace and holiness is such as the saints may
   attain unto in this life: Col. iv. 12, That ye may stand perfect and
   complete in all the will of God.' So we are perfect when we want none
   of those things which are necessary to salvation, when we study to
   avoid all known sin, and address ourselves to the practice of all known
   duty, serving God universally and entirely.

   Secondly, There is perfection legal and evangelical. Legal is unsinning
   obedience; evangelical is sincere obedience: the one is where there is
   no sin; the other no guile, no allowed guile. The one standeth in an
   exact conformity to God's law, the other in a sincere endeavour to
   fulfil it; the one will endure the balance, the other can only endure
   the touchstone.

   1. The legal perfection is described Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is every one
   that continueth not in all the words of this law to do them.' A
   personal, perpetual perfect obedience. It supposeth a man innocent; it
   requireth that he should continue so; for the least offence, according
   to that covenant, layeth us open to a curse; as the angels, for one
   sin, once committed, were turned out of heaven, and Adam out of
   paradise. The omitting of aught we are to perform, the commit ting
   aught we are forbidden, yea, the least warping, as well as swerving, by
   an obliquity of heart and spirit, maketh us guilty before God. Now this
   is become impossible through the weakness of our flesh. Rom. viii. 3.
   Man is fallen already, and hath mixed principles in him, and cannot be
   thus exact with God.

   2. Evangelical: when the heart is faithful with God, fixedly bent and
   set to please him in all things: 2 Kings xx. 3, Remember, Lord, I have
   walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.' This may be
   pleaded in subordination to Christ's righteousness; this perfection is
   consistent with weakness: 2 Chron. xv. 17, Nevertheless, the heart of
   Asa was perfect all his days;' and yet he is taxed with several
   infirmities. This perfection all must have: 1 Chron. xxviii. 9, And
   thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him
   with a perfect heart and a willing mind.' What is done for God, as it
   must be done willingly, readily, not by constraint, but the native
   inclination of the soul; so perfectly, that is, with all exactness
   possible. As some may do many things which are good, but their hearts
   are not perfect with God: 2 Chron. xxv. 2, He did that which is right
   in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.' Not a sincere
   bent of soul towards God alone. When the heart is divided between God
   and other things, Hosea x. 2, Their heart is divided;' James i. 8, A
   double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.' A heart against a
   heart; in point of faith, between God and other confidences; in point
   of love, between God and the vanities of the world; and God's interest
   is not chief, nor do we love him above all things; in point of
   obedience, between pleasing God and pleasing men, and pleasing God and
   our own vain fancies and appetites, honouring God and promoting our
   worldly ends; you set up a rival and partner with God. Now this
   perfection we must have, or else not in a state of salvation.

   Thirdly, There is a perfection absolute and comparative.

   1. That is absolutely perfect to which nothing is wanting. This is in
   our Lord Christ, who had the Spirit without measure; this is in our
   rule, but not in them that follow the rule: Ps. xviii. 30, As for God,
   his way is perfect.' But that absolute perfection is not in any of the
   saints here upon earth, I prove by these arguments:--

   [1.] Where there are many relics of flesh or carnal nature left, there
   a man cannot be absolutely perfect; but so it is with all the godly,
   there is a double-warring working principle in them: Gal. v. 17, For
   the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,
   and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the
   things that ye would.' And it is actually confirmed in Paul, witness
   his groans, Rom. vii. 24, Oh wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
   me from the body of this death?' Mark there, the apostle speaketh of
   himself, not of another; of himself, in his present renewed estate, not
   of his past and unconverted estate, when a pharisee. His past estate he
   had spoken of, ver. 9, Sin revived, and I died;' but, ver. 14, I am
   carnal;' and ver. 15, That which I do, I allow not;' and ver. 18, How
   to perform that which is good, I find not.' Many things there said
   cannot agree to a carnal man. As, for instance, not allowing sin, ver.
   15; hating sin, in the same verse: What I hate, that do I;' so delight
   in the law of God, ver. 22. Again, there is a double man distinguished,
   ver. 17, It is no more I, but sin that dwelleth in me.' Again, he
   distinguisheth between him and his flesh, ver. 18; so between an
   outward and inward man, ver. 22, 23. Lastly, He giveth thanks for
   deliverance by Christ, all which are competent only to the regenerate.
   Now, these things being so, surely God's best servants are not
   absolutely perfect.

   [2.] There are none but sometimes sin: 1 Kings viii. 46, For there is
   no man that sinneth not;' and Eccles. vii. 20, There is not a just man
   upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not;' and James iii. 2, In
   many things we offend all;' 1 John i. 8, If we say we have no sin, we
   deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.' Therefore, no man so
   perfect as to be without all sin.

   [3.] There is none but need the mercy of God, and ought to pray for
   this mercy for the pardon of their daily sins, Mat. vi. 13, as we pray
   for daily bread. This petition our Lord directeth us to put up, not for
   the sins of others, but our own. Now these arguments prove that no man
   hath a righteousness that is perfect, without defects. The best of
   God's children have innumerable frailties, which may humble them, and
   which should be seriously laid to heart, and watched over, every step
   of our way to heaven.

   2. There is a comparative perfection, and that is twofold:

   [1.] When those who live under the law of Christianity are compared
   with other institutions.

   [2.] When the professors of Christianity are compared among themselves.

   [1.] When the professors of Christianity are compared with those that
   live under other institutions. They that submit to Christ's terms are
   said to be perfect, because Christianity itself is a perfection. For
   instance, take that one place (and the rather, that I may wrest it out
   of the hands of the Papists, who distinguish between evangelical
   precepts of necessary duty, and counsels of perfection, to establish
   monkery and voluntary poverty, as a more perfect state of life than
   that which the common sort of Christians live). Their most colourable
   place is Mat. xix. 21, Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go
   sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
   treasure in heaven, and come and follow me.' Is not this a counsel of
   perfection? Doth not Christ call it so? Or is every one bound to give
   all his goods to the poor, and turn monks or anchorites? No; the
   meaning of the word, If thou wilt be perfect, is no more but this, if
   thou wilt ascend to that higher pitch and rule of living, to which I
   come to raise men, if thou wilt be a Christian. The perfection here
   spoken of is Christianity itself, not a heroic eminent degree of it;
   and the condition here required is matter of command, not counsel; only
   such as if we will not submit to, we are not Christians; for a man that
   would have the privileges of the gospel, he must submit to the duties
   of the gospel, or the conditions required by Christ, that is to be a
   perfect, thorough Christian. You will say, Must we sell all and give to
   the poor, in contemplation of the heavenly reward?

   Ans. 1. Every man is bound to bestow goods, land, and life as God shall
   direct, and part with all the wealth in the world whensoever it is
   required of him. Now, it may be required of us directly or by
   consequence. Directly, by an expressed command, such as this young man
   had from Christ; and actually to sell our estates, and give to the
   poor, obligeth none, unless we have such a like command from Christ
   himself as this young rich man had. By consequence, when we cannot obey
   any particular precept of Christ without danger of being undone by it.
   And so it obligeth all Christ's disciples to part with all, rather than
   to break with Christ; for no man is a Christian unless he selleth all
   for the pearl of price, Mat. xiii. 46. And our Lord telleth us, that he
   that loveth anything more than him, is not worthy of him, Mat. x. 37;
   that is, is no Christian; so that if it be impossible to preserve our
   fidelity and obedience without parting with our wealth, we must
   impartially perform it, though it be with loss of estate and life
   itself; and if we do not resolve and undertake to do so, we are no
   Christians, and cannot be saved. In baptism, we vow to forsake the
   world and follow Christ, when the world cometh in competition with him.
   If, in a time of trial, we do not perform it, we forfeit the privileges
   of Christianity, and all title to blessedness. Therefore this
   perfection is necessary for all Christians. You esteem, prefer, choose
   Christ above all, resolving, whatever it cost you, to be faithful to
   him; it is not a high and arbitrary point in Christianity, but a
   necessary duty. You will say, What can the strongest Christian do more
   than sell all, than part with all?--Answer, They can do it with far
   greater love, readiness, and joy, than the weak Christian can do. The
   difference between Christians is not in the thing done, but the manner
   of doing. Well, then, this is to be perfect, thus must you all be
   perfect; for this perfection is necessarily constitutive of sincerity;
   you are not true Christians without it.

   [2.] When compared with others of the same profession, believers are
   distinguished into perfect and imperfect. Though none can attain to
   absolute perfection of holiness, yet there are several degrees of
   grace, and diversities of growth among Christians, and the strong are
   said to be perfect in comparison of those weak ones who are raw in
   knowledge, or feeble and impotent in the resistance of sin. Thus the
   perfect are opposed to the babes in Christ; as, when he had spoken of
   our growing into a perfect man in Christ Jesus,' he presently addeth,
   That henceforth we be no more children,' Eph. iv. 13, 14. And
   elsewhere, when he had spoken of the perfect,' 1 Cor. ii. 6, who are
   skilful in spiritual things, he presently opposeth to them the babes in
   Christ,' chap. iii. 1. The same you may observe in Heb. v. 13, 14, He
   that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness, for he is a
   babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,'
   telei'oi, perfect,' as in the margin. See also 1 Cor. xiv. 20,
   Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit, in malice be ye
   children, but in understanding be men,' perfect, or ripe of age.'
   These, and many other places, show the notion of perfect: it is not
   absolutely taken, but comparatively. Those who well and thoroughly
   understand Christian doctrine, and are habituated to a course of
   godliness, and have a confirmed faith and love to God, and this in
   opposition to novices and inexperienced Christians newly entered into
   Christ's school. Now thus we must be perfect, not always children. It
   is a monstrous thing, after many years' growth to be a babe still, and
   an infant still. This sense is of chief regard here.

   3. There is a perfection of parts, and a perfection of degrees; that is
   growth.

   [1.] Perfection of parts is when we have all things that belong to a
   sincere Christian, or to a state of salvation; as living creatures are
   perfect as soon as they are brought forth, for they have all things
   belonging to that creature; it is not maimed or defective in any part:
   thus an infant is perfect the first day of his birth, as well as a man
   of riper age. Thus a Christian must have the perfection of integrity,
   all the parts which belong to a new creature; grace to enlighten the
   mind, bend and incline the heart to God, govern the affections, rule
   the appetite; one grace added to another, that the Christian may be
   entire and perfect, and in no point lacking, James i. 4. What is
   defective in parts cannot be supplied by any after-growth. A Christian
   cannot be perfect in degrees unless he be perfect in parts; leave out
   one necessary grace and the new creature is maimed; some leave out
   temperance, others patience, others love, 1 Peter ii. 5, 6, 7.

   [2.] There is a perfection of degrees, that is, when a thing is
   absolute and complete, and to which nothing is wanting, and hath
   attained its akme` and highest pitch. So we are only perfect in heaven,
   Heb. xii. 23, The spirits of just men made perfect;' those spirits who
   are unclothed and divested of the body; in their mortal life only they
   were upright, [8] but in their heavenly life perfect. Here they walked
   with God, and endeavoured an universal obedience to him, and so made
   capable; but now live with God, and are admitted into a nearer
   communion with him than we mortals are; they are freed from all sin and
   temptation, they are beyond growth: corn doth not grow in the garner,
   but in the field. Well, then, though we be not perfect in degrees, yet
   we must all be perfect as to parts, we must entirely resign ourselves
   to God's use, without allowing any part or corner of our hearts to be
   possessed by any other.

   4. Perfection is to be considered with respect--(1.) to our growth, or
   (2.) our consummation; here it is only in fieri, there in facto esse.
   Things are said to be done when they are begun to be done, 2 Cor. v.
   17. And so they are said to be perfect who are in the way of
   perfection; he that is in his growing estate, increasing more unto
   grace and righteousness; 2 Cor. iii. 18, Beholding as in a glass the
   glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image;' 2 Cor. iv. 16,
   Though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
   day.' They do seriously set upon the work. Thus perfection is taken:--

   [1.] As to means. The ministry was appointed for the perfecting of the
   saints,' Eph. iv. 12. That they may be more enlightened and more
   sanctified; more brought to the knowledge of God and obedience of his
   will. There are means appointed by God for the perfecting of grace, as
   well as the first working of it in us: 1 Thes. iii. 10, That I may
   perfect what is lacking to your faith.'

   [2.] As to the improvement of means: 2 Cor. vii. 1, Perfecting holiness
   in the fear of God,' making progress in the way of grace towards
   perfection, when the habit is more increased: 2 Peter i. 8, For if
   these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither
   be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ.' And Christian
   practice is more uniform: 1 Thes. iv. 1, That as ye have received of us
   how ye ought to walk and please God, so that ye would abound more and
   more.' It is not enough to have grace, but we must grow in grace;
   progress is always necessary, though exact perfection be not attained,
   so that then the heart is perfect with God, when you make it not a
   slight purpose only, but your constant endeavour to come up to your
   pattern and rule, continually striving against sin, and aiming at a
   higher degree of holiness.

   (2.) Consummate. When after all the hazards of the present life, when
   at length we shall be presented to Christ, and by Christ to God.
   Presented to Christ: Col. i. 28, That we may present every man perfect
   in Christ Jesus;' that is, fully complete, according to that holiness
   required and exemplified by Christ. And by Christ to God: Col. i. 22,
   To present you holy, and unblamable, and irreprovable in his sight.'

   I now come to the reasons.

   Secondly, The reasons why we must be perfect, that is, not only
   sincere, having all parts of a Christian, but endeavour after the
   highest perfection, and for the present, want nothing conducible nor
   necessary to salvation.

   1. We have a perfect God: Mat. v. 43, Be ye perfect, as your heavenly
   Father is perfect,' God's perfection is our copy, and that is exact,
   and we are required to imitate him; and, therefore, we must not set
   bounds to our holiness, and say, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no
   further;' when we are come never so far, yet this is not like God. The
   force of this rule is not taken off, because it is limited to one
   perfection in the divine nature in the Evangelist Luke, for he readeth,
   instead of being perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect, Be ye
   merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful,' Luke vi. 36--that is a
   special way of Christian perfection; but God's children must aim at the
   perfection of all virtues, not only love to enemies. As mercy is one of
   the divine perfections which we ought to imitate, so is holiness,
   veracity, and wisdom, 1 Peter i. 15, 16. Surely this direction was
   given in the gospel to some purpose or not: if not, then Christ spoke
   words in vain; if to some purpose, we are obliged to perfection; though
   we cannot fully obtain it in this life, we must still aim at more, and
   come more near to it. And having God for our pattern, we should always
   set him before our eyes, as he is represented to us in his word, and
   his Son Jesus Christ, the express image of his person, to be imitated
   by us.

   2. We have a perfect rule: Ps. xix. 7, The law of God is perfect;' and
   2 Tim. iii. 17, The word of God is able to make the man of God perfect,
   thoroughly furnished to every good work,' The strictness of the law as
   a rule is adopted into the covenant of grace, into the very frame and
   constitution of it, and so far bindeth as to allow no weaknesses and
   imperfections, but that we must still bewail failings, and strive after
   the utmost conformity to it in all things. As we have a perfect
   pattern, so we have a law still, that is the perfect rule of all
   righteousness, and therefore we should endeavour to conform to it more
   and more.

   3. We have a perfect Redeemer: Col. ii. 10, Ye are complete in him.' We
   have all things from him, and in him, necessary to salvation. In
   ourselves we are empty, destitute of everything which might commend us
   to God, but there is a fulness in Christ to be communicated to all who,
   being sensible of their own emptiness, do seriously apply themselves to
   him; a perfect wisdom, a perfect righteousness, perfect sanctification,
   and supplies for our perfect glory and blessedness. He beginneth by his
   Spirit to renew our natures, and this grace is still of the growing
   hand, till all be crowned in glory; there is a complete fulness in our
   Mediator.

   4. There is a perfect reward, or a perfect state of glory, in which
   there is nothing wanting, either to holiness or happiness. The
   scripture describeth it by our growing up into a perfect man in Christ
   Jesus, Eph. iv. 13. We have our infancy at our first conversion, when
   liable to childish ignorance and many infirmities; we have our youth
   and growing age, when making progress in the way of grace towards
   perfection; and lastly, we have our perfect manly age when we are come
   to our full pitch, when grace is fully perfected in glory. In scripture
   there is nothing said of the fading and declining time of old age. Oh!
   blessed will that time be, when we shall be holy and undefiled, above
   the reach of temptations; when believers receive all immediately from
   the fountain of holiness, and are filled with the fulness of all
   perfections. And shall we that have such hopes be lazy and negligent?
   No; we must press towards the mark, if we expect it as our felicity, we
   must prize it, and seek after it, and get more of it every day.

   Use 1. Is to press and exhort you to labour after Christian perfection.

   1. Motives. What you lost in Adam must be recovered in Christ, or else
   you dishonour your Redeemer. Now we lost in Adam innocency and perfect
   holiness, therefore you must seek to recover it by Christ, for
   certainly Christ is more able to save than Adam to destroy, Rom. v. 17.
   The abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness came by Jesus
   Christ. It is true, Christ doth his work by degrees; but if we mind it
   not, and lazily expect that he should make us perfect, how will it ever
   be? for God will not save us without us; and as far as we hope for
   anything, we must endeavour after it, for Christian hope is not a
   devout sloth, but an encouragement to diligence.

   2. We pray for perfection, and therefore we must endeavour after it,
   otherwise our prayers are a mockery. We pray, Mat. vi. 8, and 1 Thes.
   v. 23, The God of peace sanctify you throughout, even your whole body,
   soul, and spirit.' We pray for complete sanctification in hope to
   obtain it. Prayer is not for God's sake, but ours--a solemn binding
   ourselves to use the means, that we may obtain the blessings that we
   ask.

   3. In our making covenant, we purpose to do the whole will of God; now
   where there is a purpose, there must be an endeavour and a progress,
   for otherwise it is not made with a true heart, Heb. x. 22. A man may
   purpose duty in a pang, which afterward he retracts in his conversation
   and practice; he may wish for perfection, like it in the general, not
   considering it as exclusive of his beloved lusts, but there he will be
   excused. Yea, he may sincerely purpose it, yet be faint and slack in
   his endeavours. Therefore, we need to be exhorted continually to be
   more earnest and diligent in holiness, to avoid all appearance of
   evil,' 1 Thes. v. 22. Not to allow ourselves in the omission of any
   known duty, James iv. 13, or the commission of any known sin, though
   never so near and dear to us: Ps. xviii. 23, I was upright before thee,
   and kept myself from mine iniquity.' Therefore, unless we comply with
   these exhortations, and set ourselves sincerely to do the whole will of
   God, the challenge will be brought against us which was brought against
   the church of Sardis. I have not found thy works perfect before God,'
   Rev. iii. 2. Your vows were good, but your practice is not answerable.

   4. Consider the comfort and peace of that man who doth more and more
   press towards perfection: Ps. xxxvii. 37, Mark the perfect man, behold
   the upright, for the end of that man is peace.' They have a sweet life,
   and a happy close, a tolerable passage through the world, and a
   comfortable passage out of the world.

   For means:--

   1. See that the work be begun, for there must be converting grace
   before there can be confirming grace, life before there be strength and
   growth, as .there must be fire before it can be blown up; for what good
   will it do to blow a dead coal, to. seek strength before we have life?
   It is as if we should give food or physic to a dead man. The secure and
   impenitent are not to be confirmed and strengthened, but humbled and
   changed. We must first choose God for our portion before we can be
   exhorted to cleave to God, Acts xi. 23. First, the perfection of
   sincerity before the perfection of growth and progress, the measures
   and degrees following the real being of grace in the soul.

   2. If you would be perfect, the radical graces must be strengthened,
   which are faith, hope, and love; strong faith, fervent love, lively
   hope. Such a faith as realiseth the unseen glory, and giveth such a
   deep sense of the world to come, as that you are willing to venture all
   upon the hopes of it; such a hope as sets the heart upon glory to come,
   as present things do not greatly move us; such a love as levelleth all
   our actions to God's glory, and our eternal enjoyment of him, Jude 20,
   21.

   3. Use the means with all seriousness and good conscience. These
   conduce to perfect what is lacking to your faith, to root you, ground
   you in love, confirm you in hope, that the thoughts of heaven may be
   more affecting and engaging. Now the principal means are the word, and
   sacraments, and prayer.

   [1.] In the word you have principles of faith, obligations to love, and
   arguments of hope; therefore it is said, God buildeth us up by the word
   of his grace, Acts xx. 32.

   [2.] The sacraments strengthen faith, hope, and love, as signs and
   seals of the love of God, through Jesus Christ, in the new covenant,
   that so our consolation may be more strong. They strengthen our faith
   and hope, as a bond or a vow: so they excite and engage our love and
   obedience: we bind ourselves to God anew, to pursue our everlasting
   hopes, whatever they cost us. Our great diseases are proneness to evil
   and backwardness to good: we check the one and cherish the other.

   [3.] Prayer; for it is God that perfects us, 1 Peter v. 10. He must be
   sought to; his blessing maketh the means effectual.

   4. Think much and often of your perfect blessedness, which you expect
   according to promise, which will quicken and excite you to more
   diligence. There is a time coming when the mind shall be filled with as
   much light, and the heart with as much love and joy, as the capacity of
   it is able to contain. There will be:--

   [1.] A complete vision of God and Christ, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. No desire of
   the mind shall be unfilled or unsatisfied with the knowledge of God in
   Christ.

   [2.] A complete possession and fruition of God. Here we are in a
   waiting, expecting, longing posture, but there is a plenary fruition;
   we are filled up with all the fulness of God, Eph. iii. 19, and 1 Cor.
   i. 30. God is all in all.

   [3.] A complete similitude and transformation into the image of Christ,
   1 John iii. 2; Ps. xvii. 15. Here grace is mingled with corruption; we
   are like God by the first-fruits of the Spirit, but unlike him by the
   remainders of corruption; but in heaven we shall be wholly like him.
   Here we resemble Christ, but we also resemble Adam, yea, and often show
   forth more of Adam than Jesus; but there we only show forth the
   holiness and purity of Christ, his image shineth in us without spot and
   blemish.

   [4.] A complete delectation arising from all the rest, the vision,
   fruition, and likeness of God, Ps. xvi. 11. Those delights are full and
   perpetual: our great business will be to love what we see, and our
   great happiness to have what we love. This is our never-failing
   delight; we enter into our Master's joy, Mat. xxv. and 1 Peter iv. 13,
   That when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad with an exceeding
   joy.' The Lord hath reserved the fulness of his people's joy until that
   time when sorrow will be no more.

   Use 2. Are we perfect, that is, grown Christians in the way to
   perfection?

   The notes of it are:--

   1. When there is such a base esteem of worldly things, that our
   affections are weakened to them every day. One half of religion is
   dying to the world, as the other half is living to God, the mortifying
   of self-love, and the strengthening and increasing our love to God.
   Self-love is gratified by the pleasures, honours, and profits of the
   world; so love to God aimeth at the enjoyment of God, when we get above
   the hopes and fears of the world, and the delights of sense. I am
   crucified to the world,' Gal. vi. 14, when everything is loss and dung
   for Christ's sake.

   2. When more unsatisfied with present degrees of holiness, with a
   constant endeavour to grow better. Our maimed and defective ser vice is
   a real trouble to us; we bewail our wants and imperfections; I cannot
   do what I would: O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
   the body of this death?' It is the grief and shame of your hearts that
   you serve God no better; you are still groaning, longing, striving
   after greater perfection: but when you allow your selves in your
   imperfections, and digest failings without remorse, you are weaklings
   in Christianity. A true Christian desireth the highest degree of
   holiness, and to be freed from everything that is sin, cannot sit down
   contented with any low degree of grace; it is a trouble to him that he
   knoweth and loveth God no more, and serveth him no better; his smallest
   sins are a greater burden to him than the greatest bodily wants and
   sufferings, Rom. vii. 23, 24.

   3. Such are more swayed by love than fear. Weak Christians are most
   obedient when most in fear of hell; but the more we love the Lord our
   God with all our hearts, the more we advance towards our final estate.
   At first our pride and sensuality beareth sway and rule in us, and have
   no resistance, but now and then some frightenings and ineffectual
   checks from the fears of hell. Such they [9] are not converted yet. And
   if the sense of religion do more prevail upon us, yet our condition is
   more troublous than comfortable, and all our business is to escape the
   everlasting misery which we fear; and so we may forsake the practice of
   those grosser sins which breed our fears, or perform some duties that
   may best fortify us against them. But this religion is animated by fear
   alone, without the love of God and holiness, that is only preparative
   to religion, near the kingdom of God; but when really converted, we
   have the Spirit of his Son inclining us to God as a Father, Gal. iv. 6.
   But as yet the spirit of adoption produceth but weak effects; we differ
   little from a servant; it is perfect love casteth out fear,' 1 John iv.
   18. When the soul loveth God, mindeth God, and is inclined to the ways
   of God, delighteth in them as they lead to God, then we are in a better
   progress, and more prepared for our final estate: his great motive is
   love, his great end is perfect love. For the present he would serve him
   better, because he delighteth in his ways. Oh, how I love thy law!' Ps.
   cxix. 97, and ver. 140, Thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant
   loveth it.' They are willing and ready for God; these are thoroughly
   settled in a Christian course.

   4. The grown Christian is more humble, he seeth more of his defects
   than others do. Weak Christians are more liable to be puffed up than
   the wiser and stronger; for the more men increase in grace, whether
   knowledge or holiness, the more they know their emptiness,
   unmortifiedness, and manifold sins and failings, the more they know of
   the jealousy of God's holiness, of the evil of sin, of the strictness
   of the covenant, have a deeper sense of their obligations to God, and
   have more experience of their own slippery hearts: sin is more a burden
   to them than ever they see; they have more [10] difficulties to grapple
   with, and all this keepeth them humble and low in their own eyes. All
   this is spoken to press you to look to this growth and progress which
   is our perfection. By the way, he that thinketh he hath grace enough to
   be saved, and careth for no more, dealeth more niggardly with God than
   he would do in the world; if a man hath bread enough to keep him from
   starving, would he be content?' There is no truth where no care of
   growth; if our condition be safe, it is not sure to us.

A PERSUASIVE TO UNITY IN THINGS INDIFFERENT.

   As many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in anything ye be
   otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.--Phil. III. 15.

   I NOW come to the other part of the text:

   1. As many as be perfect, be thus minded: touto phroneite, think the
   same thing with me--that is, forsaking all other confidences, cleave to
   Christ alone, whatever it cost you. Mind this, take care of this, be
   thus affected; let us actually perform that to which circumcision was
   designed; let us worship God in a spiritual manner, trusting Christ as
   the substance of all these ceremonial shadows, depending upon him for
   his renewing and reconciling grace, and adhering to pure Christianity,
   without mingling with it the rudiments of Moses.

   2. If in anything ye be otherwise minded, know not the abolition of the
   ceremonies through weakness of faith, or an affected ignorance; yet
   having knowledge of so many saving truths, we hope in time God will
   reclaim you from your error. Well then--

   [1.] Here is a difference or dissent supposed: thus minded,' and
   otherwise minded.'

   [2.] Lenity expressed towards the dissenters: If in anything ye be
   otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.'

   Doct. That when God's people are divided in opinion, all lenity and
   mutual forbearance should be used to prevent things from coming to an
   open rupture.

   So sweet and mild was the discipline in the apostle's days, that he
   would not compel men to do whatever he or others did conceive to be
   good, or to forbear what they did conceive to be evil, but, without
   force, leave them to God's direction and illumination.

   Here let me show you:--

   1. What lenity and forbearance should be used.

   2. The reasons why lenity and forbearance should be used.

   1. What lenity and forbearance should be used. Let us state it in these
   considerations:--

   [1.] There may be, and often are, differences of opinion about lesser
   things in the church; partly because of the different degrees of light.
   All barks that sail to heaven draw not a like depth of water. And
   partly because of the remainders of corruption in all. Inordinate
   self-love is not in all alike broken and mortified, and so their
   particular interests have an influence upon their opinions. And partly
   because of the accidental prejudices of education and converse, &c.

   [2.] When these differences arise, we should take care they come not to
   a rupture and open breach. This is the course the apostle taketh here;
   he doth not by and by despair of the dissenters, and reject them as
   heretics, but beareth with them, hoping in charity God will at length
   reveal their error to them by the ministry of his servants, through the
   powerful operation of his Spirit, and not suffer them to run on in
   dividing courses from the rest of his people. So should we do in like
   cases. Partly because when these differences of opinion breed division
   and separations, the church is destroyed: Gal. v. 15, For if ye bite
   and devour one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of another.'
   Backbitings, revilings, and reproaches make way for a total vastation
   of the whole church, a ruin to both parties. Partly because the whole
   [11] is scandalised: John xvii. 21, That they may all be one, that the
   world may believe that thou has sent me.' Divisions in the church breed
   atheism in the world. Partly because there are enemies which watch for
   our halting, and by our divisions we are laid open to them. Our Lord
   and Master hath told us with his own mouth, that a kingdom divided
   against itself cannot stand,' Mat. xii. 25. Never was it so well with
   the people of God, but besides their divisions among themselves, they
   had common enemies; and Nazianzen calls them Common Reconcilers,'
   because they should engage God's people to a unanimous opposition to
   the kingdom of Satan in the world. And partly because then mutual means
   of edification are hindered. As long as charity and mutual forbearance
   remaineth, there is hope of doing good to one another; but when men
   break out into opposite parties, they are prejudiced against all that
   light that they should receive one from another, suspecting every point
   as counsel from an enemy: Gal. iv. 16, Am I therefore become your
   enemy, because I tell you the truth?' When men are once engaged in a
   way of error, whosoever is an enemy to their error is counted an enemy
   to themselves; yea, they can hardly bear that sound doctrine which doth
   directly cross their opinions, but are apt to cavil at all that is said
   by a dissenter. And partly because when men give themselves up to
   separating and narrow principles, the power of godliness is lost, and
   all their zeal is laid out upon their petty and private opinions, and
   so religion is turned into a disputacity. That is the reason why the
   apostle doth so often tell them, Gal. vi. 15, For in Christ Jesus
   neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new
   creature;' and Gal. v. 6, For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
   availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love;'
   and 1 Cor. vii. 19, Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is
   nothing, but the keeping the commandments of God.' Observe it where you
   will, and you shall find that separation and distance from the rest of
   believers, doth not befriend godliness, but undermine it A regiment
   fighting apart from the rest of the army of Christ, is always lost
   through their own peevishness; at least, they lose great advantages of
   promoting the kingdom of Christ.

   [3.] To prevent this open rupture, there must be all lenity used and
   mutual forbearance. We must not rigorously obtrude our conceits upon
   others, either by church-power, or private censure. It may be done
   either way; sometimes by church-power, especially when it is possessed
   or invaded by the more self-seeking sort of Christians; as we read in
   the Revelations of the beast that pushed with the horns of a lamb--that
   is, used church-power, and under a pretence of church-constitution
   destroyed them that were truly the church of Christ. And our Lord
   telleth us, John xvi. 2, They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea,
   the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, shall think that he doth
   God good service.' Putting them out of the synagogues was an abuse of
   ecclesiastical power: it may be so, the builders may refuse the
   corner-stone. On the other side, private censures may as much break the
   law of forbearance as public censures, when inferiors promote their
   differences with turbulency, heat, and animosity, and rend and tear all
   things, yea, themselves, from the body of Christ, and sober Christians,
   censuring all that dissent from them as no Christians. There is such a
   sin under the gospel as the gainsaying of Korah, Jude 11. The sin of
   Korah is and may be committed in the New Testament. The sin of Korah
   was invading an office that no way belonged to him, and censured his
   superiors, as if they took too much upon them, because all the Lord's
   people were holy, and erected another ministry in their stead. He,
   being a Levite, would do the office of a priest as well as Aaron; and
   when summoned to appear before Moses, said, We will not come,' Num.
   xvi. 11, 12. Now the apostle saith, in the perishing of Korah their own
   doom was foretold. Again, ver. 19, These are they that separate
   themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit.' Whence it is clear that
   private men, in their sphere, may rend the church. And the factions at
   Corinth proved it: 1 Cor. i. 12, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos, and
   I am of Cephas, and I am of Christ,'--as impailing and impropriating
   the common salvation to themselves. Much milder was the apostle: 1 Cor.
   i. 2, Jesus Christ, theirs and ours.' Now what remedy is there but
   lenity and mutual forbearance? This I shall state:--

   1. As to the matter of the strife. It must be considered that we must
   dispense this forbearance as the matter will bear. There are great
   disputes about toleration; only let me tell you now, that we speak not
   of the toleration of the magistrate, but of the church, what things are
   within the latitude of allowable differences within the church. The
   magistrate's concessions may be larger; for in supernatural things,
   such as matters of religion are, he may bear with that which the church
   ought not to bear with in them that have submitted to a higher
   institution, or in its own members, or rather private Christians one
   with another. But in this limited forbearance there are extremes, and
   for want of right stating of things, men fight with their friends in
   the dark; some think all things should be suffered; some nothing
   wherein to bear with our brethren. The one sort of Christians is for
   imposing on their brethren all things that have gotten the vogue and
   the favour of authority, and that not only on their practice, but their
   judgments too; and this in matters not fundamental or destructive to
   faith or worship, but in things controversial or doubtful among godly
   and peaceable men. But if it should not go so high, contending about
   every difference of opinion, and urging our brethren with everything we
   conceive to be right, is a breach of Christian love, and destroyeth the
   use of those differing gifts which Christ hath given to the church, and
   crosseth his mind in the frame of the scriptures, which are clear in
   soul-saving matters; in other things, especially matters of discipline
   and order, more dark and obscure. It is also contrary to the mild and
   gentle government of the apostles, who press in lesser matters a
   forbearance; as Paul, Rom. xiv. 1, The weak in faith receive, but not
   to doubtful disputations;' receive him, own him, but do not cast him
   out of the church, nor trouble him for doubtful things, but let him
   come to himself, for men will sooner be led than drawn.

   The other extreme is of them that will have all things to be tolerated,
   even blasphemy and fundamental errors, as if the scriptures were
   uncertain in all things. No; in things absolutely necessary to
   salvation, it is clear, open, and plain: The law is a lamp, and a
   light,' Prov. vi. 23, and Ps. cxix. 105. And in such a case we are not
   to bid him God-speed,' 2 Epist. John 10. In such cases of damnable
   heresy, the law of Christian lenity holdeth not; but if we agree in the
   principal articles of faith, let us embrace one another with mutual
   love, though we differ from one another in variety of rites and
   ceremonies and discipline ecclesiastical. If we agree in the
   substantial of worship, let us go by the same rule, do the same thing:
   though in circumstantials there be a difference, these are matters of
   lesser moment than separation, or the other [12] division of the
   church.

   2. As to the persons contending, there is a difference. The apostle,
   when he persuadeth this lenity and mutual forbearance, excepts those
   that raise troubles in the church, and distinguisheth between erring
   Christians and their factious guides: Phil. iii. 2, Beware of dogs,
   beware of evil-workers, beware of the concision.' The poor seduced
   Christians he would have to be pitied, but the renders and cutters of
   the church, he would have them beware of such.

   3. The forbearance itself. It is not a forbearance out of necessity,
   because we dare do no otherwise, but voluntary choice out of Christian
   pity and compassion, knowing that we need as much forbearance from God
   and others, for we all have our mistakes and failings; not a
   forbearance out of policy, till we get opportunity to suppress others:
   the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for us. God often layeth that
   restraint upon us by his providence; and it is well he doth: but it
   should be the restraint of grace, not a respect to our own ease, lest
   we create trouble to ourselves, but upon Christian reasons. No; the
   apostle showeth you whence this forbearance should come: Eph. iv. 2, 3,
   With all lowliness and meekness and long-suffering, forbearing one
   another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
   bond of peace.'

   There are four graces enforce it:--

   [1.] Lowliness, which is a grace and virtue, whereby a man, from the
   sense of his own infirmities, doth esteem but meanly and soberly of
   himself, and all that is his.

   [2.] Meekness, whereby we are rendered tractable, gentle, affable, and
   easy to be entreated and conversed withal, James iii. 17.

   [3.] Long-suffering, which is nothing but meekness extended or
   continued, and not interrupted by length of time, or multiplication of
   offences.

   [4.] Love to our Christian brother or neighbour, whereby our hearts are
   inclined or well-disposed towards them for their good. Love covereth a
   multitude of sins,' 1 Peter iv. 8. Maketh us bear with many things in
   the person loved, 1 Cor. xiii. 4, Charity suffereth long, and is kind;'
   and ver. 7, Beareth all things, hopeth all things.' This is the
   forbearance we press, a forbearance out of meekness and humility and
   love for Christ's sake.

   4. In this forbearance, both strong and weak have their part, and are
   much concerned, as having either of them much to do herein. Which, that
   we may clear to you, let us consider:--

   First, What they are not to do.

   1. Not to leave the truth, or to do anything against it. No; the
   apostle saith, Let as many as be perfect be thus minded;' not change
   truth for error. Strings in tune must not be brought down to strings
   out of tune, but they brought up to them.

   2. Not to connive at their sin or error, for that is not love but
   hatred: Lev. xix. 17, Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart;
   thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon
   him.' To let him go unconvinced is to harden him: 2 Thes. iii. 15, Yet
   count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.' The sins of
   others must not be let alone under the pretence of forbearance; and
   there must be no neglect of means to reclaim them from their sin, but
   meekly we are to hold our light to them, and use all holy means of
   convincing and satisfying their judgments.

   Secondly, What they are to do.

   1. The strong are not to deal rigorously with the weak, nor insult over
   them, nor pursue them with censures, but wait till God declare the
   truth unto them, and must promote their conviction with all gentleness
   and condescension. We are to feed Christ's lambs as well as his sheep,
   and for both we need love, John xxi. 15, 16. Among the flock of Christ
   there are variety of tempers and degrees of strength, both lambs and
   sheep. We must imitate our Lord: Isa. xl. 11, He shall feed his flock
   like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry
   them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.' We
   should condescend to the weak and feeble ones, as well as consider what
   the strong and confirmed can bear. Though we cannot love their
   weakness, yet we must love the weak, and bear with the infirmities of
   the weak, not break the bruised reed. Infants must not be turned out of
   the family because they cry, and are unquiet and troublesome; though
   they be peevish and froward, yet we must bear it with gentleness and
   patience, as we do the frowardness of the sick; if they revile, we must
   not revile again, but must seek gently to reduce them, notwithstanding
   all their censures; to entertain them with contempt is to prejudice
   them quite against all instruction. Job would not despise the cause of
   his man-servant or maid-servant when they contended with him, Job xxxi.
   13.

   2. The weak. But who will own this title and appellation? Because in
   controversies of religion, all seem to stand upon the same level, and
   another differeth from me as much as I do from him; their opinion is as
   far from mine, as mine from theirs; who then shall be accounted weak?

   I answer:--

   1. Our rule is plain; and as it distinguisheth error from truth, so
   weakness and partial Christianity from that which is more perfect and
   thorough. Besides, it is clear some have not the gifts of knowledge and
   experience that others have, nor such advantages of education and
   study, and helps of knowing the truth; and though they are not to
   captivate their understandings to the dictates of others, yet they
   should search and search again and again, and have double light, when
   they are by the seeming evidence of truth forced to differ.

   2. Christianity teacheth us to think meanly of ourselves, and not to be
   wise in our own conceits: Phil. ii. 3, In lowliness of mind, let each
   esteem others better than themselves;' at least, we should have such a
   sense of our imperfections as to make us tractable and teachable.

   3. If you will not own yourselves weak, do the part of the strong
   meekly, hold forth your light, produce your reasons to convince others;
   but if you have nothing to produce but your obstinacy and ignorance,
   surely you are not only a weak, but a perverse brother. But what are
   the weak to do? Not to rend and cut off themselves from the rest of
   Christians, or be strange to them upon every lesser dissent, nor to
   raise troubles by your censures, but to be humble, teachable, diligent
   in the use of means, to lay aside obstinate prejudices, to examine how
   it cometh to pass that the rest of the godly and you differ; to leave
   room still for the discovery of God's mind where your grounds are not
   clear and certain, and to count it no shame to retract that former
   practice which a future conviction disproveth.

   II. The reasons.

   1. From the necessity, excellency, and utility of union. What more
   clear in the scriptures than that Christians should endeavour to be
   united? Christ prayed for it: John xvii. 21-23, That they all may be
   one, that they may be one as we are one, that they may be perfect in
   one.' And the apostle enforceth it by the most vehement intreaties that
   can be used: Phil. ii. 1,2, If therefore there be any consolation in
   Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
   bowels of mercy, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the
   same love, being of one accord and of one mind.' Who can withstand such
   an adjuration and powerful beseechings as these, that if ever they
   found any comfort by his ministry, and ever had any hope by Christ,
   ever any influence of the Spirit, ever any pity and compassion over
   souls, that they would look after unity in judgment, love, and
   affection, and lay aside their differences, and carnal emulations?
   Again, they caution us against those that cause divisions: Rom. xvi.
   17, 18, Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
   and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
   them; for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their
   own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
   the simple.' They press unity upon us by very cogent arguments, that
   carry the highest reason with them: Eph. iv. 4-6, There is one body,
   and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one
   Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above
   all, and through all, and in you all.'

   Seven uniting considerations are there heaped up together:--

   [1.] There is one body of Christ, whereof all are members. The whole
   church maketh but one body, knit by faith to Christ, their head, and by
   the bond of love among themselves; and the meanest Christian is a
   member in this body. Now it is unnatural if the members of the same
   body should tear and destroy one another, and that the body of Christ
   should be rent and torn; and woe be to them by whom it is so!

   [2.] This body is animated by one Spirit; that if any be a member of
   this body, it is necessary that he have the Spirit of God abiding in
   him, to renew and quicken him. Now, this one and the self-same Spirit,
   as the apostle calleth him, 1 Cor. xii. 11, worketh in all the saints.
   If his gifts be various, they proceed from the same author, and they
   are variously dispensed, to preserve society and communion, that one
   may not say to another, I have no need of thee.' However, there is but
   one new nature in all the sanctified.

   [3.] One hope of glory. We are all joint-heirs of the same kingdom, we
   all expect one end and happiness, where we shall meet and live together
   for ever. Now those that shall meet and live together in glory
   hereafter, should live together in peace and concord here.

   [4.] There is one Lord,' one Mediator and blessed Saviour. Now, shall
   the servants of one Master fall at odds with themselves, neglect their
   Master's work committed to them, beat their fellow-servants, and eat
   and drink with the drunken?

   [5.] One faith,' fides quæ creditur: he meaneth the doctrine of faith
   in the gospel. We agree in the same fundamental truths of the gospel as
   the only object of saving faith, and shall we strive about things of
   less importance and moment? There is but one gospel, which is the seed
   of our new birth, the rule of our faith and lives, the foundation of
   our hope, the food of our souls.

   [6.] One baptism.' that is, the same new covenant sealed and confirmed
   by baptism; and when our Father's testament is clear, do we quarrel
   about petty and mean things?

   [7.] One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and
   in you all.' We have one common God and Father, whose eminency is above
   all creatures, whose presence and powerful providence runneth through
   all creatures; but his special presence, by the gracious operations of
   his Holy Spirit, is in the regenerate. Surely this is a strong bond of
   union, to be one in God. He is the common Father of all believers,
   through Jesus Christ. Some are weak, some strong, some rich, some poor,
   but they have all an equal interest in God. Now, for us, who are so
   many ways one, to be rent in pieces, how sad is that! All these places,
   and many more, show how every Christian should, as far as it is
   possible, be an esteemer and promoter of unity among brethren, and not
   only make conscience of purity, but of unity also, which, next to
   purity, is the great badge of Christianity.

   2. From the consideration of our mutual frailties, who have all in part
   a corrupt will, guided by a blind mind. Now, as the apostle saith of
   the high priest, who is taken from men, Heb. v. 2, that he is one that
   can have compassion of the ignorant, and them that are out of the way,
   for that he is compassed about with infirmities;' this should be
   verified in every one of us. One sinner ought to have compassion of
   another. The word is metriopathein duna'menos, can reason ably bear
   with the ignorance of brethren, because of the common relation: Gal.
   vi. 1, Ye which are spiritual, restore him with meekness;' so him that
   is weak, receive,' Rom. xiv. 1. The apostles, being immediately
   inspired, were more infallible than we are.

   [1.] Oh, do but consider what we were, and what we are: For we
   ourselves were sometimes foolish and disobedient,' Titus iii. 3. Did
   not we all sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death? Were we not all
   ignorant of the ways of God, and the things which belong to our peace?
   Hath God merely by his grace brought us to the knowledge of his truth?
   and shall we contemn and disdain our weak brother, or insult over him,
   and determine and judge rashly of him? Who maketh thee to differ?' 1
   Cor. iv. 7.

   [2.] What we are--weak creatures, not infallible. Now after we are
   light in the Lord, we have our errors in knowledge and practice, some
   more, some less, according to the degree of our growth, Ps. xix. 12.
   God revealeth to his saints all necessary truth, but not every
   particular truth, out of wise dispensation.

   3. From the consideration of the probability of divine illumination.

   [1.] This illumination cometh from God only. It is he that power fully
   revealeth it, and settleth the heart in the belief of it: Acts xvi. 4,
   and 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7, I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the
   increase.' The best means may be disappointed, till God cooperate with
   them. Let us, then, with patience, use the means, and refer the issue
   to God: 2 Tim. ii. 25, In meekness instructing those that oppose
   themselves, if, peradventure, God will give them repentance unto life.'
   If we seek to force men to our opinion, before men are convinced, that
   is a tyranny which will do little good; it may make hypocrites, but it
   will never make real converts.

   [2.] This illumination is given by God by degrees. The apostle prayeth
   for the converted Ephesians, that God would give them the spirit of
   wisdom and revelation,' Eph. i. 17. They had it before, but he meaneth
   a greater measure. Therefore, weak Christians are not to be discouraged
   though they see not as far as others. Some see more, some less,
   according to the state and condition wherein God will employ them. Some
   need more light than others, as ministers more than people, governors
   more than inferiors; but all have sufficient. Some at first see men
   walking like trees, Mark viii. 24, 25, but after wards the light
   groweth more clear and more distinct. In short, he doth not reveal his
   mind to his children all alike, nor all at once, but here a little and
   there a little, as narrow-mouthed vessels can take it in.

   [3.] Those who are not for the present, may be afterwards instructed in
   the truth. The apostle proceedeth in the hopes of that:--

   (1.) Upon the supposition that they were already converted to the
   Christian faith, and were sincere in the belief and profession of it.
   Those that belong to God will one time or other be enlightened in the
   knowledge of all necessary truths: For God that hath begun a good work,
   will perfect it,' Phil. i. 6. If the saints at first conversion, when
   they were called from darkness to light, did not hinder illumination
   then, and the knowledge of those many soul-saving truths which God
   revealed to them then, so as to recover them from a partial error, we
   may presume that God will give them a further understanding of the way
   of salvation, though now under some error; as Aquila and Priscilla
   expounded to Apollos the way of God more perfectly, Acts xviii. 26.

   (2.) Upon the supposition that they were humble and tractable: Ps. xxv.
   9, The meek he will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way.'
   They lie open to information; but if men be puffed up with
   self-conceits, there is more hopes of a carnal fool than of them, that
   is, a sensual and brutish man.

   (3.) That they will not neglect any means of study and prayer.
   Study--for we must dig for knowledge as for silver (Prov. ii. 4)--not
   only cry for it, but dig for it in the mines of knowledge; common and
   obvious apprehensions lead us into error. And then prayer: Ps. cxix.
   18, Lord open mine eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of thy
   law,' God must take away the veil. Now, then, upon prayer to God, and
   applying themselves to the use of holy means, God will show them they
   are deceived. If you study and not pray, it is just with God to leave
   you to your prejudices; if you pray and neglect means, you must not
   think that God will extraordinarily inspire you, for he revealeth truth
   by his blessing on ordinary means.

   (4.) Upon suspicion that they continue in the communion of the church:
   Eph. iv. 15, Speaking the truth in love.' While we keep unity and keep
   love, others have greater hopes to convince, they to be convinced; and
   so both, while they divide not, by this mutual condescension, may the
   better wait for this illumination; but in their separation, their
   errors are confirmed while they hear but one side, nothing to undeceive
   them, but all to root them in their errors.

   (5.) He supposeth that they walked orderly according to their light.
   Now if God hath begun to enlighten them in other things, he will
   discover more truths to them, John vii. 17; upon the whole, deal
   tenderly with them and tolerate them, till they be taught of God.

   (6.) As to the nature of his confidence, God shall reveal.' There is a
   twofold confidence, a confidence of faith grounded on a promise, and a
   confidence of charity grounded on appearance and probability, 1 Cor.
   xiii. 7. We hope the best, though the event doth not always follow; the
   former is on the forementioned grounds, the latter on appearance. The
   appearance of them; so Gal. v. 10, I have confidence in you through the
   Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded; for he that troubleth you
   shall bear his judgment whoever he be.' This confidence was grounded on
   charity, that through the Lord's grace they should be reclaimed from
   their error, and brought to embrace the truth. We are not to despair of
   the recovery of any, but in charity to hope the best of all men, as
   long as they are curable. Thus for the third reason.

   4. Fourth reason , from the temper of those that are perfect. A
   grounded Christian beareth with the infirmities he seeth in others, and
   pitieth and helpeth them, and prayeth for them more than the weak, who
   are usually most censorious and addicted to the interest of their party
   and faction in the world, and make a bustle about opinions rather than
   solid godliness; but the grown Christian is most under the power of
   love and a heavenly mind, and so loveth God and his neighbour, is most
   sensible of his own frailty, hath a greater zeal for the welfare of his
   church and interest in the world, and seeth farther than others do.

   Use is to press us to this lenity and forbearance to one another.

   To this end take these considerations:--

   1. Consider in how many things we agree, and in how few we differ.
   There is a threefold unity; in mind, and heart, and scope.

   In mind: Rom. xv. 5, 6, Now the God of patience and consolation grant
   that you be like-minded one towards another, that ye may with one mind
   and one mouth glorify God.'

   In heart: Acts iv. 32, And the multitude of them that believed were of
   one heart and of one soul.'

   As to the scope, Rom. xv. 5-7. Now as to the way, it is either the
   general way of faith and holiness, for all that shall be saved are of
   one mind as to the substantials of faith and worship: Jer. xxxii. 39, I
   will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever.'
   But there may be a different practice as to some lesser things; should
   we for these break with one another?

   2. Take more notice of their graces than of their infirmities. Is there
   no good thing found in them? Rev. ii. 6, But this thou hast, that thou
   hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans.' See also ver. 2 and 5. He
   beginneth and endeth with their commendation, though in the middle of
   the epistle he reproveth them for their decay; he taketh more notice of
   what is right than what is wrong. We reflect upon the evil of every
   party, but do not consider the good.

   3. Remember how open the enforcements to love and unity are, and how
   much the grounds of separation lie in the dark, and are in a doubtful
   case, but union is the safest part.

   4. Think of God's love and forbearance towards us before we received
   the light of his truth, and were brought to the obedience of his will;
   as God dealt with the Israelites, so with every one of us: Acts xiii.
   18, He suffered their manners in the wilderness.' If we had been dealt
   with rigorously, we had been cut off from the number of God's people,
   had such stumbling-blocks and prejudices laid in our way, that we
   should never have been converted to God.

   5. This forbearance cannot in reason be expected from others to
   ourselves, if we be not ready to repay it to others. There is no man
   which hath not infirmities of his own which call for forbearance, James
   iii. 2. In the general, every man is obliged to do as he would be done
   unto, Mat. vii. 12. So in particular, he is reproved when he had his
   own debt forgiven him, yet took his fellow-servant by the throat and
   showed him no mercy, Mat. xviii. 28. We have all our failings and
   mistakes; usually God punisheth censures with censures, Mat. vii. 1,
   injuries with injuries. Paul, that stoned Stephen, was himself stoned
   at Lystra. So he punisheth separations with separations; they are
   endless, as circles in the water beget one another.

   6. Consider how dangerous it is to reject any whom Christ will own for
   his. Will Christ admit him to heaven, and will you think him unfit for
   your communion here upon earth? Despise not the weak brother, for God
   hath received him, Rom. xiv. 3. The Gentile believer must not despise
   the scrupulous Jewish believer, and cast out of his communion the
   Gentile Christian; if God hath admitted him into his family, shall we
   exclude him? So Mat. xviii. 6, Whosoever shall offend one of these
   little ones which believe in me, it were better that a millstone were
   hanged about his neck, and that he were cast into the sea.' Now what
   greater offence than to cast them off from the privileges of the
   Christian church, either by public or private censures which are
   causeless or unwarrantable, at least no way grounded on necessary
   things?

   7. As we must not on our part give offence or occasion the divisions,
   so we must not take offence when it is given by others; for charity, as
   it provoketh not, so it is not easily provoked,' 1 Cor. xiii. 5. So
   likewise if a rent be made by others, we must do what we can to heal
   it. If an angry brother call us bastard, yet let us own him as a
   brother and a child of the family: for Blessed are the peacemakers,'
   Mat. v. 9. The world censureth us for compliers and daubers, but God
   counteth us his genuine and true children.

   8. Our endeavours after unity among the professors of Christianity
   ought to be earnest and constant: Eph. iv. 3, Endeavouring to keep the
   unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' I add this partly because
   many make fair pretences of peace and union, which their practice
   contradicteth; all cry out of the divisions, but every one keepeth them
   up; and partly, because when it is endeavoured we shall find
   difficulties and disappointments, but we must not rest in some careless
   endeavours, nor grow weary though we meet not with present success; and
   partly because the instruments of so great a good are usually
   sacrificed to the wrath of both parties. We must be content to digest
   affronts, reproaches, censures, and injuries, and love them that hate
   us: 2 Cor. xii. 15, Though the more abundantly I love you, the less I
   am beloved of you.'

NOT TO BE OFFENDED IN CHRIST, THE READY WAY TO BLESSEDNESS.

   And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me.--Mat. XI. 6.

   THESE words are the conclusion of Christ's answer to John's disciples,
   who were sent from him in prison to inquire if Christ were the true
   Messiah, or they must look for another. This message was not sent for
   his own satisfaction, but theirs; not his own, for he had before openly
   owned Christ as such, John i. 29, but theirs: they are offended in
   Christ out of respect to their master. For answer Christ referreth them
   to his works, whether they were not such as the prophets foretold were
   to be performed by the Messiah.

   Two things he urgeth:--

   First, His miracles.

   Secondly, His preaching the gospel.

   First, His miracles. The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the
   lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and
   the poor have the gospel preached to them.' This was foretold: Isa.
   xxxv. 5, 6, Then the eyes of the blind shall be open, and the ears of
   the deaf shall be unstopped: then shall the lame leap as an hart, and
   the tongue of the dumb shall sing.' And then for his setting afoot the
   gospel, compare Isa. lxi. 1, with Luke iv. 18. Isa. lxi. 1, The Spirit
   of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach
   good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken
   hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening the
   prison to them that are bound.' Luke iv. 18, The Spirit of the Lord is
   upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor:
   he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to
   the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty
   them that are bruised; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.' And
   Luke iv. 21, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.' This
   is here expressed, The poor have the gospel preached to
   them'--(ptochoi` euangeli'zontai) The poor are evangelised'--have not
   only the promises of the gospel offered to them, but the impression and
   power of it is left upon their hearts. By the poor may be meant the
   humble-minded, or persons of the meanest and lowest condition--the
   humble-minded, or such as were affected with their sin and misery. The
   proud resist and stand out against the gospel, but the broken-hearted
   thankfully accepted glad tidings of this salvation. The Messiah was to
   preach to the poor,' Luke iv. 18. But in Isa. lxi. 1, it is the meek.'
   The gospel doth affect the poor needy soul, so as to put a stamp of
   grace upon it. They that are sensible of their sin and misery are the
   proper objects of this dispensation; or else it may be meant of persons
   of the meanest and lowest condition. The Christian church was made up
   of such at first: James ii. 5, Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not
   God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the
   kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?' and 1 Cor. i.
   26, For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after
   the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.' Christ did not
   then call the eminent and great, but the obscure and despised of the
   world, lest religion should seem to owe its growth and progress rather
   to the power of the world than to the evidence of the truth. Now these
   are said to be evangelised, that is, to have a good share in the
   blessed message, they above others being wrought upon and affected with
   it. To be evangelised implieth grace on God's part, and on theirs a
   willing reception of the impression of it, so as to be changed by it.
   The poor are all to be gospelled; those whose poverty is sanctified to
   make way for brokenness of heart, which is not said to exclude the rich
   from all benefit; some were called then, though not many. Grace, where
   it prevails in the heart, puts rich and poor on the same level. It
   humbleth the rich, and exalteth the poor, James i. 9, 10. It teacheth
   the one to abound, the other to be abased, Phil. iv. 12. Poverty and
   riches do as they are used. Now, saith Christ, tell John the things
   that ye hear and see; let him expound the characters of the Messiah as
   they lie in the Old Testament; and if they be verified in me, see what
   application and inference you ought to make. Therefore he dismisseth
   them with this conclusion: And blessed is he whosoever shall not be
   offended in me.'

   In which words observe:--

   1. The privilege: And blessed is he: it is meant of our supreme
   blessedness.

   2. The qualification: Whosoever is not offended in me. Where
   observe--1. It is negatively expressed: not offended. 2. There is a
   universal negative: whosoever is not. But are all those who are not
   offended at Christ saved? I answer, No; you must look upon this
   conclusion as annexed to the last clause of the former verse,--The poor
   have the gospel preached unto them: and blessed is he whosoever shall
   not be offended in me.' To be offended is to be scandalised, or kept
   from owning Christ as the true Messiah: all are happy and blessed so
   far as they are evangelised, and miserable so far as scandalised. When
   the kingdom of heaven is brought to us, nothing can bar us from
   entering into it but our being offended in Christ. But if we be not
   scandalised so as to hinder our being evangelised, then we are in a
   happy and blessed condition; that is, blessed so far as the impediment
   of our blessedness is removed; and indeed, that is all the blessedness
   we can attain unto in this life. Thus blessedness is ascribed to pardon
   of sins, Ps. xxxii. 1, because that taketh away the legal impediment.
   Blessedness is ascribed to sanctification, Ps. cxix. 1, Blessed are the
   undefiled in the way,' because that removeth the moral incapacity, and
   so is a forerunner of eternal happiness: and here it is ascribed to not
   being offended in Christ when he is sufficiently revealed to us, as it
   removeth the impediment of our faith, which is always some offence and
   dislike that we take at Christ and the ways of God.

   The point that I shall insist on is this:--

   That whosoever, being invited to embrace the gospel, is not offended in
   Christ, is in the ready way to true blessedness.

   In the prosecution of this point I shall use this method:--

   First, To show you what it is to be offended in Christ.

   Secondly, Upon what occasions men were then offended.

   Thirdly, Whether this sin were proper to that age only, or we may now
   be guilty.

   Fourthly, I shall show you the kinds of this sin.

   Fifthly, How it is true that those which escape this sin are in the
   ready way to salvation.

   First, What it is to be offended in Christ.

   I answer--To be offended in Christ is to be offended because of Christ;
   something in him which we dislike, which is a hindrance to our
   receiving and owning him in that quality wherein he appeared in the
   world, and offereth himself to us--namely, as our Lord and Saviour.
   Ska`ndalon, in the natural sense of it, signifieth either any obstacle
   or hindrance laid in a man's way, by which the passenger is detained or
   stopped: peculiarly it is put for those sharp stakes which they were
   wont to stick in the ground in the ancient way of warring, to wound the
   feet and legs of their enemies in their pursuit of them, against which
   they used greaves of brass: most usually ska`ndalon signifieth a stone
   or block in the way, at which a man is apt to stumble and fall. So 1
   Peter ii. 8, Unto them which believe, Christ is precious; but a stone
   of stumbling, and a rock of offence to them that stumble thereat.' A
   rock with respect to those that travel by sea, a stone of stumbling
   with respect to those that travel by land. So it is used here, Who are
   not scandalised at Christ.' In this expression there is something
   expressed and something supposed.

   1. It supposeth some offer and revelation made to us, that grace is
   brought home to us, and salvation offered to us. Jews and professing
   Christians are more properly said to be offended in Christ than
   heathens who never heard nor sought after him, 1 Cor. i. 23: We preach
   Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, to the Greeks
   foolishness.' They stumble who, being invited to come to him, dislike
   and are displeased with something in him; or being on their way, are
   upon some occasion and temptations laid aside and prejudiced, and
   either stumble or fall in the way undertaken by them, or have no heart
   to go forward, but either directly retire or faint.

   2. It expresseth or implieth such an offence, that either they are kept
   off from Christ, or else drawn away from him.

   [1.] Some are kept off by their carnal prejudices, or offence they take
   at somewhat of Christ, and so continue in their unbelief; thus Christ
   is said to be a rock of offence to the disobedient,' 1 Peter ii. 8,
   that is, the impenitent and unbelieving world, who, out of indulgence
   to their lusts, slight an offered Saviour.

   [2.] Others are drawn from him, as those that had carnal expectation
   when they were disappointed: John vi. 66, From that time many of his
   disciples went back, and walked no more with him.' This is the offence,
   when we are either discouraged from, or in the ways of godliness.

   I now come to show you:--

   Secondly, Upon what occasions were men then offended in Christ. They
   were displeased with his person, sufferings, doctrine.

   1. His person. They were somewhat alarmed with his miracles, and the
   wisdom of his gracious speeches, but how to reconcile this with the
   meanness of his person they were at a loss. Sometimes his birth and
   breeding were a distaste to them: Mat. xiii. 55, 56, Is not this the
   carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,
   James, Joses, Simon, Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?
   Whence then hath this man all these things? And they were offended in
   him.' So Mark vi. 3, Is not this the carpenter, brought up in the same
   trade with Joseph?' Thus upon the consideration of his mean and known
   beginning they forsook him. Sometimes they quarrelled at his country,
   not where he was born, but bred. He was born in Bethlehem, but bred in
   Nazareth, which was in Galilee, and Galilee, as they conceived, was
   looked upon by God as a mean and despicable place: John vii. 52, Art
   thou of Galilee? (speaking to Nicodemus), search and look, for out of
   Galilee ariseth no prophet.' This was the common conceit, for Jonah was
   of that country. So John vii. 41, when some said, This is the Christ,'
   others said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?' That country was under
   a reproach. Nay, a good man was possessed with this prejudice: John i.
   46, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? And Philip saith, Come and
   see.' Trial would make him of another mind. But many good people are
   led away with common prejudice, and so overlook things and persons of
   the chiefest regard, &c. Sometimes they were offended at the meanness
   of his followers: John vii. 48, Have any of the rulers and pharisees
   believed in him? But this people, that knoweth not the law, are
   cursed;' that is, the rabble are ready to follow any false teacher, and
   such ones follow him.

   2. They were offended at his doctrine, the mysteriousness of it, as
   when he had spoken of eating his flesh and drinking his blood, they
   could not tell what to make of it. If it signified anything, it
   signified his death, and that was a point not to be touched upon in the
   hearing of them that expected a glorious, pompous Messiah, that should
   subjugate other nations to them. Therefore Christ saith, Doth this
   offend you?' John vi. 61. Yea, the offence was so great, that many of
   his disciples went backward, and walked no more with him,' ver. 66.
   Sometimes they were offended at the holiness of it, as when he pressed
   the pharisees, who were altogether for external observances, to look
   after an inward cleansing: Mat. xv. 12, Knowest thou not that the
   pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?' This was a great
   distaste to them to hear that a man is defiled by sin, and not at all
   by meats, and that the washing of the heart is the chief thing.

   3. The great stumbling-block of all was his sufferings. This offended
   good and bad. The good: Mat. xxvi. 31, All of you shall be offended
   because of me this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
   and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. And Peter saith,
   Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be
   offended,' ver. 33. The bad: This was the great stumbling-block to the
   Jews: 1 Cor. i. 23, We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
   stumbling-block.' By this they fed their obstinacy and prejudice. They
   could not believe that he that was crucified as a malefactor was the
   Son of God and the Saviour of the world.

   Thirdly, Was it not proper to that age only? I answer, No; we also may
   be prejudiced, and guilty of this sin of being offended in Christ. You
   will say, What danger is there of that now, since Christ is publicly
   owned, and Christianity in fashion r and the world run into the church?

   I shall show you:--

   1. That there is danger still.

   2. What is likely to offend since Christ's exaltation.

   1. There is danger still:--

   [1.] Because though the name of Christ be had in honour, yet the
   stricter profession and practice of godliness is under reproach, and
   the nominal hateth the serious Christian, though both own the same
   Bible, believe the same creed, and are baptized with one and the same
   baptism into the same profession. Those that are false to their
   religion will malign and scorn those that are true to it, and live up
   to the power of it. As there is no commerce between the living and the
   dead, so no true friendship between the carnal and the heavenly. Among
   the outside Christians, it will be matter of reproach to be serious and
   diligent; and they that are so, will be accounted more precise and nice
   than wise. No wonder if they slight you, who first slight God, and
   Christ, and their own salvation.

   [2.] It may happen that the stricter sort of Christians are the poorer
   sort; and such as carry no great port and appearance in the world; and
   so, though they be precious in the eyes of God, yet they may be
   despised by men. Strictness of religion is many times looked upon by
   some as too mean a thing for persons of their rank and quality; and so
   whilst the poor receive the gospel, they, to keep up their greatness,
   go the broad way to hell; these are offended in Christ. In Salvian's
   time, Quantus in Christiana populo honor Christi est, ubi religio
   ignobilem facit; Coguntur esse mali ne viles habeantur,--religion makes
   them base, and men are compelled to be evil, that they may not be
   scorned and disgraced. Now we should resolve to be more vile for God, 2
   Sam. vi. 22.

   [3.] Though men be not distasted against Christianity in whole, yet in
   part; though they be not offended in Christ altogether, yet they take
   offence at some of his ways, wherein his glory and interest is
   concerned. In the age that we live in, many of those things that fall
   within the conscience and compass of our duty may be under a cloud and
   disesteem. Now they that have received light about these things should
   not be offended though the generality of the world decry and oppose
   them. Christ gets up by degrees; and where the main of religion is
   received, yet all the parts and branches of it are not received, which
   must be required in their place; and though we are not always bound to
   the positive profession of lesser things, yet we are bound negatively;
   we must do nothing against the truth, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. We must not
   renounce a truth because it is run down by a vulgar prejudice, but in
   all meekness of wisdom own the better way. Such constancy of mind is
   expected from a good man, who consults with conscience rather than
   interest.

   [4.] The world may not be able to bear the owning of these truths; and
   therefore, those who set them afoot may be disgraced, afflicted, and
   reproachfully used; but the knowledge of a hated truth is a greater
   argument of God's favour than the prosperity of the world: Prov. iii.
   32, Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways; for the
   froward is an abomination unto the Lord, but his secret is with the
   righteous.'

   [5.] There is no man in the world but, if he run up his refusal of
   Christ, or his impenitency and unbelief, to its proper principle, he
   will find it to be some offence or dislike, either because of the
   inward constitution of his mind, or the external state of religion in
   the world. Either he cannot bring his heart to suit with the
   strictness, purity, and self-denial of Christ's religion, or Christ's
   religion to suit with his heart. As the young man, Mark x. 22, He was
   sad at that saying, and went away grieved, for he had great
   possessions.' Or else, if both suit, the world liketh not the match; so
   that it cometh to this point, that he must be an enemy to God or the
   world: James iv. 4, Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that
   the friendship of the world is enmity with God! Whosoever, therefore,
   will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.'

   2. What is likely to offend, since Christ's exaltation of his person in
   heaven, and his religion in the world?

   [1.] The many calamities which attend the profession of it. John, who
   was his forerunner, was now in prison when Christ spake these words;
   and Christ foretelleth grievous troubles and afflictions: Mat. xxiv.
   10, And then many shall be offended.' And he foretelleth us that we may
   not be offended: John xvi. 1, These things have I spoken unto you, that
   ye should not be offended;' that is, scandalised by the hazards which
   attend Christ's service, or take occasion to alien ate themselves from
   him. Yet all will not do: Mat. xiii. 21, When persecution ariseth for
   the word, by and by he is offended.' A man is offended when he findeth
   that which he did not look for. Many promise themselves ease and peace
   in Christianity; and when it falleth out otherwise, they dislike what
   they formerly seemed to prize.

   [2.] They may take offence at Christ's doctrine, at the purity, the
   self-denial, the simplicity, the mysteriousness of it.

   (1.) The purity of it. To holy men this is an argument of love: Ps.
   cxix. 140, Thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.' But
   to the carnal of dislike and offence: John iii. 20, Every one that
   doeth evil hateth the light; neither cometh he to the light, lest his
   deeds should be reproved,' They have somewhat to conceal, some what
   which they are loth to part with. And so, lest they should be found
   faulty, and engaged to reform themselves, they cannot endure the light
   of the gospel, and are offended at Christ's strict doctrine, as sore
   eyes are at the brightness of the sun. This light is not only shining,
   but scorching.

   (2.) The mortification and self-denial of it. Mortification respects
   our lusts, and self-denial our interest. Our worldly interests are the
   baits of our carnal desires or lusts. Now, to crucify the flesh or deny
   the world are both distasteful to flesh and blood; and, therefore, they
   are apt to say, This is an hard saying;' and What strange doctrine is
   this?' 1 Peter iv, 4, They think it strange that you run not with them
   to the same excess of riot.' It is matter of great admiration that
   others should abandon their course of life. The sweetness of Christ's
   service is wholly hidden from them; therefore they hate that religion
   which they do profess, and all that are serious in it. They think
   strange God should plant desires in them which he would not have to be
   satisfied. But they do not distinguish between what nature craveth and
   corruption lusteth after. That the inordinancy is from themselves, and
   therefore have a secret dislike of Christ in their souls, because they
   would do what they list, not what they ought. They would not be
   fettered by any of his laws, or look upon that fruit as forbidden which
   corrupt nature hath a longing unto, as if all necessary restraint were
   a kind of prison to them.

   (3.) The simplicity and plainness of the gospel, void of human wisdom
   and excellency of words. It is a plain thing teaching the way how
   sinners may return to God and blessedness. This doctrine is clad in the
   simple attire of a vulgar style; and this was the offence of the
   Gentiles, who would be gratified with eloquence and profound knowledge:
   1 Cor. i. 22, The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
   wisdom;' that is, the Jews, who were trained up in extra ordinary
   dispensations, they would have miracles and prodigies from heaven. The
   Gentiles look for profound philosophy in the gospel, and scorn it
   because they find it not there. Their offence was be cause they found
   not matter of dispute, but practice; for they were altogether bred up
   in the uncertain debates of their philosophers. But little did these
   mind that there was a sublimity of wisdom in this plain doctrine (1
   Cor. ii. 6, We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the
   wisdom of this world,' &c.), as discovering the true way of easing the
   conscience, and the nature of true happiness, which were the two things
   about which the wisest and profoundest of them spent all their thoughts
   and speculations. Nor did they mind this: that laws would lose their
   authority, if not delivered in a plain style; nor would our duty so
   clearly be stated by man's reason as by God's authority. When it is to
   be found out by man's reason it is left more to the uncertainty of
   dispute. Bare nature is a hard book to study in, nor are the lessons of
   it so easily found out. While the wise men of the world were debating
   about felicity and happiness, practical godliness died upon their
   hands, and men strove rather to be witty than good, and so delivered
   things more coldly, and not with that life and power and authority for
   the reclaiming and reducing man to his duty to God; like the curious
   wits of our age, who delight to speak finely, father than successfully,
   in the matters of religion.

   (4.) The mysteriousness of it above all natural reason. The devil
   playeth on all hands; sometimes the doctrine of the gospel is too
   plain, sometimes too mystical. It cannot enter into their hearts to
   conceive how God should be distinguished into three persons, how God
   should become man, and the like; and therefore scoffing atheists, such
   as are rife in the latter days, question all; and having lost the light
   of their reason, yet retain the pride of their reason, and are
   objecting all the difficulties they can think of against the truth of
   the word of God, and are apt to say, as Nicodemus, John iii. 9, How can
   these things be?' Till they see a reason for everything they will not
   own it. Indeed, we must see a reason why we believe everything, and
   that is, divine revelation contained in the word of God; but we cannot
   always see a reason of everything which we do believe, for many things
   are mysteries, and we receive them as we do pills, not chew, but
   swallow them; we take them upon the credit of the revealer: to chew
   produceth a loathsome ejection; to swallow, a wholesome remedy.
   Believing in the common notion of it is a receiving a truth upon the
   trust of another; so it differeth from knowing, for then we reason of
   ourselves; and divine faith is a receiving such things as God hath
   revealed, because he hath revealed them. Then our first inquiry is,
   Whether these things be so or so? not how they can be so? Therefore we
   begin at the wrong end if we inquire first, How can this be? In many
   cases, constat de re, the thing is evident in scripture; but, non
   constat de modo, how it can be is beyond our reach. Now, when we should
   believe, we dispute and cavil, rather than inquire. If any thing be not
   plainly revealed by God, you may reject it without sin; but if it be,
   you must not contradict all that you cannot comprehend the Trinity of
   the persons in the unity of the divine essence, or how a virgin should
   conceive, or how a God can become man. It is sufficient that all this
   is revealed in scripture, which carrieth its own evidence in its
   forehead, and shineth by its own light, and hath the seal and stamp of
   God upon it. In short, to believe is not to receive a thing in its own
   evidence, but upon the credit of the testifier. If you will not credit
   it unless the thing be evident in itself, you do not believe Christ,
   but your own reason; and instead of being thankful for the revelation,
   you quarrel with his truth, because it is somewhat above your capacity.
   You should captivate your understandings to the obedience of Christ, 2
   Cor. x. 5.

   I now come to show you:--

   Fourthly, The kinds of this sin of being offended in Christ. Three
   distinctions I shall give you:

   1. There is an offence with contempt, and an offence with
   discouragement.

   [1.] The offence with contempt is when we are prejudiced against, or
   turn from the faith; either never embrace it, or quite forsake it.
   Contempt produceth unbelief and disobedience. They are so given over to
   their sinful courses that they cannot be persuaded to relinquish them:
   John iii. 19, This is the condemnation, that light is come into the
   world, and that men love darkness rather than light, because their
   deeds are evil.' Nothing will gain them to submit to Christ's healing
   methods; they think he seeketh their loss and hurt rather than their
   benefit, because he would reclaim them from their lusts. These reject
   all admonitions, and remain obstinate and impenitent in their sins.

   [2.] The offence with discouragement: when men are staggered in their
   hope and obedience. Troubles are distasteful to the flesh, which
   seeketh its own ease. Some are discouraged in a greater, some in a
   lesser degree: Heb. xii. 3, Lest ye wax weary, and faint in your
   minds.' Weariness is a lesser degree of deficiency, faintness a
   greater. These terms are translated from the body to the mind.

   2. There is an offence of ignorance and an offence of malice and
   opposition.

   [1.] The offence of ignorance and weakness: when men are carried with a
   blind zeal. I verily thought that I ought to do many things against
   Jesus of Nazareth,' saith Paul, Acts xxvi. 9. Men of a superstitious
   conscience are like a blind horse, full of mettle, but ever and anon
   stumbling. But this is more pardonable: 1 Tim. i. 13, Who was before a
   blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy,
   because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.'

   [2.] There is the offence of malice and opposition, when men err, not
   only in their minds, but in their hearts; do not know, and do not
   desire to know; they would not know what they know, and are willingly
   ignorant; nolentes audire, quod auditum damnare non possunt, &c.
   (Tertul. in Apol.) They have not a mind to know that which they have
   not a mind to do. They would not know the truth because they have a
   mind to hate it. This is spoken of, Acts xiii. 45, They were filled
   with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
   contradicting and blaspheming.' This is malice; men first hate, then
   persecute and oppose the truth. Conviction choked with prejudices
   breaketh out into rage against that way they were convinced of, or the
   light of which they cannot rationally withstand. Herod taketh offence
   against John the Baptist, whom he formerly liked, and then beheadeth
   him. Light resisted, or not kindly used, maketh a man turn devil, that
   he may the more deface all feelings of conscience. This is the
   malignity of revolters, Hosea v. 5; they will hear nothing to the
   contrary .

   3. There is a total and there is a partial offence. The total offence
   is when men will give Christ no place in their hearts, but remain in
   their infidelity: John viii. 24, Because ye believe not that I am he,
   ye shall die in your sins.' When they will take no warning, they shall
   perish for despising the remedy. The partial offence is, when they do
   not receive all of Christ, though they may be sound in the main; these
   are those that the apostle speaks of, that they are saved as by fire,'
   1 Cor. iii 15. Some doctrine or practice, wherein they allow
   themselves, may prove false and unchristian; yet the man may be
   mercifully dealt with by Christ, and freed from having his portion with
   unbelievers; yet it goeth hard with him, as one involved in a common
   fire hardly escapeth out of it; their salvation is more difficult. In
   short, every one is more happy, as he is less apt to be offended in
   Christ; but they are most unhappy that are most offended in him.

   I now come to show you--

   Fifthly, How it is true that those that escape this sin are in the
   ready way to salvation.

   To this I answer--

   1. The negative includeth the positive, and must be thus explained: He
   that is not offended, but evangelised, hath the power and virtue of the
   gospel stamped upon his heart: Blessed is he.' Among them that are
   offended, some forsake and fall off from Christ, others never come at
   him. But these believe so as to be changed and converted. Nothing
   hindereth them when Christ hath gained their liking and esteem; for
   this esteem that we speak of now is not a simple speculative
   approbation (for that may be, and no change follow: Rom. ii. 18, Thou
   approvest the things that are excellent'), but a practical comparative
   approbation: all things considered, Christ is best for their turns.
   Always a change followeth this esteem: Phil. iii. 8, I count all things
   but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.'
   And till we have this esteem, there is some secret offence that we take
   at Christ, either at his person, doctrine, precepts, or the bad
   entertainment they have in the world; and for the contrariety of our
   affections, Christ and we do not close with full complacency and
   delight.

   2. This esteem produceth a uniform obedience; for they that thus esteem
   Christ will study to please him. Delight in our master breedeth delight
   in our work: Col. i. 10, That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
   pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
   knowledge of God;' and 1 Thes. ii. 12, That ye would walk worthy of
   God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.' The only way to
   know whether we be more or less offended in Christ, is to compare our
   conversation and practice with his precepts. His benefits commend
   themselves to our affections, his precepts to our consciences; the one
   sweeten the other. We have such a good master, we can never do enough
   for him. If we like Christ, nothing will be grievous that he giveth us
   in charge: 1 John v. 3, His commandments are not grievous.'

   3. When we are not offended in Christ we are the better fortified
   against temptations to apostasy. They are of three sorts--errors,
   scandals, persecutions.

   [1.] Errors. Many are drawn away with vain pretences, But we have an
   unction from the holy one, and know all things,' I John ii. 20. But
   they are an offence, not only of seduction, but contristation: Rom.
   xvi. 17, Mark them which cause errors and offences contrary to the
   doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.' These are wens of
   Christ's mystical body, not parts. Errors in the church breed atheism
   in the world. Many question the ways of God, and give over all
   religion; because there are so many differences and sects, therefore
   they think nothing certain. Certainly God saw this discipline to be
   fittest for his people; he hath told us there must be errors; he would
   not have us to take up religion upon trust, without the pains of study
   and prayer. Lazy men would fain give laws to heaven, and teach God now
   to govern the affairs of the world; they would have all things clear
   and plain, that there should be no doubt about it. But the Lord, in his
   wise providence, seeth it fit to permit these things, That they which
   are approved may be made manifest.' To excuse the trouble of a search,
   study, and prayer, men would have all things agreed, else they take
   offence at religion, and that is one means to draw them off, even after
   profession. The canonists say, Non fuisset discretus Dominus Deus, nisi
   unum constituerit universalem judicem. This was their blasphemy, that
   God was not discreet and wise, unless he had appointed one universal
   and infallible interpreter. This is men's natural thoughts; the Jews
   say that Christ was not the true Messiah. Why? Because if he had been,
   he would not have come in such a way as to leave any of his countrymen
   in doubt, but would so plainly have discovered himself that all might
   know him. So many think, religion is but a fancy, and so fall off to
   atheism and scepticism at last, and irresolution in religion, because
   there are so many sects and divisions, and all upholding it with
   plausible pretences. And to excuse laziness or prejudice, men pretend
   want of certainty; but God's word is plain to all that will do his
   will, John vii. 17.

   [2.] The scandalous and evil practices of professors. These do not only
   infect but offend many, and cause them to stumble at religion, or fall
   into a dislike of the way of salvation. Scandal is far more dangerous
   than persecution. In persecution, though many be discouraged, yet
   others are gained to a liking of religion. There are many that have
   been gained by the patience, courage, and constancy of the martyrs, but
   never any were gained by the scandalous falls of professors.
   Persecutions do only work upon our heart, which may be allayed by
   proposal of the crown of life; but by scandalous actions, how many
   settle into a resolved hardness of heart! In crosses and persecutions
   many men may have a secret liking of the truth, and a purpose to own it
   in better times; but by this kind of scandal, men grow into an open and
   professed dislike thereof. In persecutions there is not a dislike of
   religion itself, but of the hard terms upon which it must be received;
   but by scandals men dislike religion itself, and nourish a base and
   vile opinion thereof in their hearts, and so they grow loose and fall
   off. And this mischief doth not only prevail with the lighter sort of
   Christians, but many times those which have had some taste, it makes
   them fly off exceedingly: Mat. xviii. 7, There will be offences, but
   woe unto them by whom they come.' Christ hath told us all will not walk
   up to the religion they own; but a man that is not offended in Christ
   will not be offended at the disorders of those that profess his way: 1
   John ii. 10, He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there
   is no occasion of stumbling in him.' All things that offend will not be
   taken away till the reapers come: Mat. xiii. 41, The Son of man shall
   send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all
   things that offend, and them which do iniquity.' In the meantime he
   that loveth Christ, and loveth his brother, dareth not reason from some
   to all, from persons to. the religion; for religion is not to be judged
   by the persons that profess it, but the persons by the religion. These
   things must ever be distinguished: the rule and the practice, the form
   and the power. The form, manner, or model of truth may be complete,
   though the virtue of this religion doth not prevail over all those that
   come under the profession of it. It is against all reason that the
   excellency of Christ should stand to the courtesy of man's obedience.
   The art is not to be judged by the bungling of the artist; and then for
   the other, the love of the brethren will not permit them that they
   should judge of all the rest by a few, and those the worser part. This
   is, as if a man should judge of a street by the sink or kennel, or
   throw away the whole cluster or bunch of grapes for one or two rotten
   ones. Shall the apostles be judged of by Judas? or the good angels by
   the bad? or Abraham's family by Ishmael? If some make shipwreck of a
   good conscience, others keep up the honour and majesty of religion, as
   well as they disgrace it.

   [3.] The troublesome poverty and mean outside of those that profess the
   gospel, and their many troubles and calamities; as in Christ's time the
   grandees and learned rabbis did not own Christ. Have any of the
   pharisees or rulers believed in him?' that is, persons of eminence and
   place. Celsus, the heathen, maketh the objection, Should a few mariners
   (meaning fishermen) prescribe to the world? But God never intended that
   truth should be known by pomp, nor condemned or disallowed for troubles
   that accompany it. The drift of Christianity is to take us off from the
   hopes and fears of the present world; therefore he that liketh Christ
   and his promises is not likely to be separated from him by persecution,
   Rom. viii. 37. He is held to him, not only by the head, but by the
   heart.

   Now the use that we should make of this is caution. Take heed of being
   offended in Christ. I shall show you:--

   1. Who are in danger of it.

   2. The heinousness of it.

   3. What we should do to avoid it.

   1. Who are in danger of it? I answer--

   [1.] All such as are hardened in malice and opposition against those
   that profess godliness, and have a male talent [13] against strictness,
   and are glad when it meeteth with any trouble or disgrace. The clearest
   evidence will not convince these men. Such were the froward obstinate
   Jews, who were hardened and believed not, but spake evil of that way,
   Acts xix. 9. Again, there are some that are more moderate, but are
   discouraged in their first attempts of a godly life, and so give over
   through despondency. The bullock is most unruly at the first yoking;
   the fire at first kindling casts forth most smoke. This they can not
   bear, therefore give it over as hopeless. And then partly the
   insincere, whose league with their lusts was never dissolved. And
   again, weak Christians, who are not fortified and rooted in the love of
   God, and the faith and hope of the gospel.

   2. I shall show you the heinousness of it.

   [1.] It is unreasonable. Whatsoever hindereth any man from coming to
   Christ or embracing the gospel, it is an offence not given but taken.
   There is nothing in Christ to make us stumble and be offended at him:
   Jer. ii. 5, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are
   gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?'
   but everything that may draw our desire or delight towards him; yet by
   men's blindness and ignorance it is very frequent: Luke xix. 42, They
   do not know the things which belong to their peace in this their day.'

   [2.] It is very natural. We are apt to set stumbling-blocks in our own
   way, and matter of offence before our own feet; and take up every
   obvious pretence to excuse ourselves to ourselves from hearkening to
   the offers of the gospel. Flesh and blood will stumble in God's
   plainest ways: Hosea xiv. 9, The ways of the Lord are right; the just
   shall walk therein, but the transgressors shall fall in them.' They
   will count every molehill a mountain, and be offended at everything
   which concerneth God, and their duty and obedience to him.

   [3.] A prejudicate opinion and malice is always apt to pick quarrels at
   truth and goodness: Acts xvii. 5, 6, The Jews which believed not, moved
   with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and
   gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted
   the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. And
   when they found them not, they drew Jason, and certain brethren unto
   the rulers of the city, crying, These which have turned the world
   upside down are come hither also.' So chap. xviii. 6, They opposed
   themselves and blasphemed.'

   [4.] It is a dangerous sin. If we continue to be offended in Christ,
   Christ will be offended at us at the last day. We get nothing by
   dashing against the corner-stone; we hurt not Christ but ourselves:
   Mat. xxi. 44, Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but
   on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.'

   3. What shall we do to avoid it?

   [1.] Get a clear understanding, or a zeal according to knowledge: Rom.
   x. 2, and John ix. 39, For judgment I am come into the world, that they
   which see not might see, and they which see might be made blind.' This
   will be the effect of my coming, that the ignorant will be enlightened,
   and learned men will not see the things before their eyes; they were
   hardened and left to their own prejudices.

   [2.] Get a good measure to mete things withal. The Jews were offended
   in Christ, because they were leavened with a notion of a pompous
   Messiah; and so judged of all things concerning Christ as they suited
   with that conceit. So John vii. 24, Judge not according to appearance,
   but judge righteous judgment.' We judge according to appearance, but
   judge not righteous judgment. This is no good measure, but an idol of
   our hearts. Many are in an evil way, but yet want not their pretences.
   As the tradition of the elders, Mat. xix. 2; and succession, John viii.
   33; the novelty of Christ's doctrine: Mark i. 27, What new doctrine is
   this?' The vile abject condition of Christ and his disciples. They
   never enter into the merits of the cause, but determine it by
   prejudicate opinions. A good measure, therefore, is necessary. There is
   mensura mensurans, and mensura mensurata, a measure measuring, and the
   measure that is measured. The measure that is measured is an upright
   unbiased mind.

   [3.] Labour to get a mortified heart. They are most apt to be
   scandalised that have a carnal bias upon their hearts, a contrariety of
   affections to the gospel, Luke xvi. 14; John v. 44; xii. 42, 43; who
   are leavened with covetousness, jealousy of reputation, fear of
   disgrace, and the like.

   [4.] Get a fervent love: Ps. cxix. 165, Great peace have they which
   love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.' It is want of a true and
   hearty love that maketh us so easy and apt to take offence.

   A second use that we make of it is this,--Be sure to take heed of
   prejudices against practical godliness.

   1. Some take prejudice against the necessity of regeneration. But
   surely there is a necessity of fitting us anew to the use and end for
   which we were made. For the use see Eph. ii. 10, and for the end John
   iii. from the 3d to the 5th verse.

   2. Another prejudice is the difficulty of a godly life: Mat. xix. 25,
   With men it is impossible, but with God all things are possible.' Use
   will make it easy; at first it is most hard and tedious.

   3. Another prejudice is the persecutions which attend it. God will have
   his servants and graces tried. They that go to sea must look for wind
   and waves, but in the haven we shall have rest. In heaven we shall
   enjoy full and eternal rest.

WISDOM IS JUSTIFIED OF HER CHILDREN.

   For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a
   devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Beheld a
   man gluttonous, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is
   justified of her children.--Mat. XI. 18, 19.

   IN this context Christ had likened the people of the generation in
   which he lived to boys playing in the streets, and personating (as
   children are given to imitate what they have seen in elder persons)
   sometimes festivities, acting the part of a musician, but their fellows
   danced not; sometimes funerals, acting the part of the mourning women
   who were to weep for the dead, cry, Ah, my brother! but they upbraided
   their fellows, that they would do nothing as they should, neither
   follow them in their mirth nor sadness. So the people of that
   generation, whatsoever messages God sent unto them, they accepted them
   not and obeyed them not. Some great exceptions they had still to the
   messengers employed. One kind of exception they have to John, and the
   quite contrary to Jesus; and so they are not pleased, neither full nor
   fasting, as we say. Their censure of John was that he was an
   hypochondriac, or a frantic fellow; the devil was in him that he was so
   austere. But Christ, that was gentle and affable, they censure him as a
   loose person, or favourer of such. For John came neither eating and
   drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of man came eating and
   drinking, and they say, A man gluttonous, and a friend of publicans and
   sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.'

   In the words three things are observable:--

   1. The different form and course of life wherein John and Christ
   appeared.

   2. Their censures both of John and Jesus.

   3. The receiving of the gospel by the unprejudiced.

   1. The different course of life wherein John and Christ appeared. John
   came neither eating nor drinking;' that is, lived in a strict austere
   course of life, not after the ordinary diet of men; for we read he had
   his raiment of camels' hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and
   his meat was locusts and wild honey. But the Son of man came eating and
   drinking; that is, using the ordinary diet of men, and eating
   promiscuously with all company, in a more free use of the creatures,
   taking the fare as he found it, and conversing with all sorts of men in
   a familiar course of life; sometimes with publicans, as Zaccheus;
   sometimes with pharisees, as Simon, Luke vii. He observed no such
   abstinency, but ate meats indifferently. Sometimes he had nothing but
   barley-bread and water; sometimes he was at feasts, and using wine, and
   conversed with men indifferently.

   2. Their censures both of John and Jesus. John hath a devil;' that is,
   he is a person possessed, out of his wits: for the Jews ascribed all
   distempers to the devil. And of Christ their censure was that he was a
   glutton, and a friend of publicans and sinners.'

   3. The receiving of the gospel by the unprejudiced, but wisdom is
   justified of her children.' This last clause needeth opening, that we
   may know what is wisdom, who are her children, and how they justify it.

   [1.] By wisdom is meant the doctrine of the gospel, called elsewhere,
   The counsel of God,' as appeareth by the parallel place, Luke vii. 29,
   30, And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified
   God, being baptized with the baptism of John. But the pharisees and
   lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves.' The gospel is
   called wisdom, because it is the result of God's eternal wisdom. The
   doctrine of Christ crucified is called, the wisdom of God,' 1 Cor. i.
   24; and again, 1 Cor. ii. 7, the wisdom of God in a mystery.'

   [2.] The children of wisdom are the professors of it. It is an
   Hebraism; as children of wrath,' children of light,' children of this
   world,' &c.--the professors and followers of the gospel. Wisdom hath
   her children: all are not alike indisposed; some are begotten to God by
   the doctrine of grace.

   [3.] Justified. As this is opposed to crimination, so to justify is the
   work of an advocate. As it is opposed to condemnation, so it is the
   work of a judge. Wisdom's children will bear witness to their faith, or
   the doctrine of God, by their profession and godly life and ready
   obedience, and exalt it as much as others decry it, and every way
   manifest that they hold it for good and right.

   Many points might be observed hence, as--

   1. That God sendeth forth his servants with divers dispositions; some
   more austere in life, others more social in their carriage; some sad
   and mournful, others cheerful and pleasant; some more thundering in
   doctrine, others more gently inducing people to repentance. Since God
   maketh use of variety of gifts and tempers, let us observe this wisdom,
   not bring all to the law of some admired instance and example. As there
   is a difference of stomachs, some for meats baked or roasted, others
   for boiled, so God fits his servants severally to do good, as the
   persons they are to treat with need.

   2. That men are qualified according to the dispensation wherein God
   useth them. John, as a preacher of repentance, was austere; Christ, as
   a giver of pardon, mild and affable. John was to come in the spirit and
   power of Elias, and therefore to imitate him in his course of life. He
   was sent forth to raise and awaken a sleepy world besotted in security.
   But Christ, who was to come with the glad tidings of salvation, and to
   call sinners to grace and pardon, chose to appear in a meek, sweet, and
   social way of converse, that his benignity in drawing the most grievous
   sinners to himself might thereby be manifested.

   3. That men are apt to complain, quarrel, and except against what is
   done by God, and whatsoever methods are used to reduce them to a sense
   of their duty. Both John and Jesus were sent by God, but men have ever
   somewhat to say: John is too rough and austere, and Christ too sociable
   and familiar with sinners. They dislike the severity of the one, and
   the free converse of the other. So in other cases, old men, they say,
   dote, young men are too rash; some they find fault with be cause they
   are so facile and easy; with others, because they are obscure and deep.
   People are always unsatisfied.

   4. That neither the severity of the law, nor the glad tidings of
   salvation, will of themselves work upon men, unless God set in by his
   Spirit: for both the dispensation of John and Jesus was without its
   effect.

   5. Though some obstinately refuse the gospel, yet others accept of it,
   and live accordingly. Wisdom hath her children, who justify and defend
   her ways as much as others impugn and oppose them, Acts xvii. 34. God
   seldom lighteth a candle but he hath some lost groat to seek.

   All these points might be profitably insisted on, but I shall make use
   of this text to give you this observation:--

   That Jesus Christ, when he came to set up the gospel, did not tie
   himself to a wilderness-life of austerity in total abstinence from
   common meat and wine, as John the Baptist did, and as they thought that
   he that professed extraordinary sanctity should have done.

   In the prosecution of this point I shall use this method:--

   1. I shall show you that the censures of the two things disliked in
   Christ were not just.

   2. Give you the reasons why he lived and chose this form and sort of
   life.

   3. The profitable observations that we may build thereon.

   1. That the censures of the two things disliked in Christ were not
   just. The two things disliked in Christ were:--

   [1.] His diet.

   [2.] His company.

   [1.] His diet. He came eating and drinking:' he did eat and drink as
   other men, but with great piety, and with great temperance and
   sobriety. His piety was remarkable: John vi. 11, And Jesus took the
   loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed them among the
   disciples;' and ver. 23, Nigh unto the place where they had eaten
   bread, after the Lord gave thanks.' All our refreshments should be
   sanctified; they are great mercies, though ordinary. They come down
   from heaven, and direct us to seek the blessing thence, from whence we
   have the comforts themselves. Though we have but slender provisions, we
   should be thankful; Christ gave thanks for five barley-loaves and two
   fishes. Mark, here he doth not mention the miracle, but the
   thanksgiving. Christ had expressed himself in such a way as made deep
   impression on the standers-by, and would fully convince us that the
   blessing of all enjoyments is in God's hand.

   His temperance and sobriety is observable; five barley-loaves and two
   fishes were carried about, as the standing provision for himself and
   family, Luke ix. 13. Christ's provision is such as may teach sobriety
   and contentment with a mean condition unto all. At another time he
   beggeth a draught of water to quench his thirst, John iv. 7. And
   therefore the exceptions against his diet were not just.

   [2.] Against his company. They accused him of eating with publicans and
   sinners in the text. So Luke xv. 2, This man receiveth sinners, and
   eateth with them;' because He went to them as a physician to heal their
   souls, Luke v. 30. He conversed with the meanest, and refused not
   familiarity with the poorest and worst, as was needful for their cure.
   The pharisees thought it to be against all decorum that he would speak
   and converse with all sorts of people, publicans and harlots not
   excepted; but Christ coming to save all sorts of people, it was
   necessary that he should converse with all sorts of people.

   2. The reasons why he lived and chose this sort of life.

   [1.] Because he would not place religion in outward austerities and
   observances. Men superstitiously appoint to themselves unnecessary
   tasks, and forbid themselves many lawful things, and this they call by
   the name of holiness. When Satan, who is usually a libertine,
   pretendeth to be a saint, he will be stricter than Christ himself; as
   the pharisees were in the choice of their company and outward
   observances. Christ foresaw this spirit would be working in the world:
   Touch not, taste not, handle not, after the commandments and doctrines
   of men,' Col. ii. 21, 22. That men were apt to place religion in a
   simple abstinence from the common comforts of life, under a pretence of
   more than ordinary mortification: neither eat, nor taste, nor touch.
   Over-doing in externals is usually an undoing in religion: the quaker's
   spirit and the monkish spirit is an apocryphal and bastard sort of
   holiness, a spirit that suiteth not with the temper of the gospel and
   the example of Christ.

   [2.] Christ would live a strict, but sociable and charitable life, and
   did not observe the laws of proud pharisaical separation, but spent his
   time in doing good, and healing all manner of bodily diseases, and
   instructing the souls of men upon all occasions. There is a disposition
   in men, by a foolish singularity, to stand aloof from others. The
   prophet toucheth it, Isa. lxv. 5, They said, stand by thyself, come not
   near me, for I am holier than thou.' Some then, though impure and
   profane, would seem holier than others, and counted all unclean and
   polluted beside themselves. This spirit rested in the pharisees in
   Christ's time: Luke v. 30, The scribes and pharisees murmured against
   his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and
   sinners?' So Luke vii. 39, If this man had been a prophet, he would
   have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, for
   she is a sinner.' And afterwards the whole people of the Jews were
   possessed with this spirit, and would not endure that any should
   converse with the Gentiles, as fearing to be defiled by them. Now Jesus
   Christ would not countenance this inclosing spirit; coming to do good
   to all, he would converse with all.

   3. Jesus Christ coming into the world, as to redeem us to God, so to
   set us an example, would take up that course of life which was most
   imitable by all sorts of persons, and calculated, as for the honour of
   God, so for the benefit of human society. He intended his religion not
   only for recluses and votaries, but for men of all conditions,
   professions, and employments, and therefore would not fright us from
   religion by affected austerities, but invite us to it by a sanctified
   converse with all kind of companies; and no man now can excuse himself,
   saying that he cannot imitate the form of Christ's living, since it is
   competent to all kind of persons, even those who are not shut up, but
   whose callings engage them to be abroad in the world; for it is
   religion that puts us upon the discharge of all duties to God and man.
   The sum of it is comprised in the love of God above all, and our
   neighbour as ourselves. We love all, even enemies, with that common
   love which is due to humanity, and all that fear God with a special
   love. Now this may be exercised in the shop better than in the cloister
   and solitudes, and wherever we go we may go about doing good; and this
   may be done by all sorts of persons, princes and peasants, noblemen or
   tradesmen, as well as ministers and people of a more retired life.

   [4.] Coming into the world, to set up the kingdom of God, it was fit
   his form of life should suit with the nature of that kingdom. John
   Baptist telleth them, The kingdom of God is at hand;' and Christ
   himself, that the kingdom of God was come, and was among them. Now what
   is the nature of this kingdom of God? The apostle telleth you that The
   kingdom of God standeth not in meat and drink, but in righteousness,
   and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,' Rom. xiv. 17. There are two
   expositions of that place, and both equally probable; the one more
   general, the other more limited and restrained to the context: more
   general, that righteousness is taken for all new obedience, and peace
   for peace of conscience, resulting from the rectitude of our actions;
   and joy in the Holy Ghost, for that supernatural comfort which the Holy
   Ghost puts into our hearts, by reflecting upon our privileges in
   Christ, and the hopes of the world to come. Now Christianity consists
   not in eating, or not eating such or such meats, or such kind of
   observances, but in solid godliness, or in the practice of Christian
   graces and virtues. The more limited sense is, that by righteousness is
   meant just dealings; by peace, a peaceable, harmless, inoffensive sort
   of living; by joy in the Holy Ghost, a delight to do good to one
   another; to advance and build up one another in godliness, not
   dividing, hating, excommunicating, censuring one another for lesser
   things and mere rituals, but pleasing our neighbour to edification:
   Rom. xv. 2, and 1 Cor. x. 31-33, Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever
   ye do, do all to the glory of God: give no offence, neither to Jews nor
   Gentiles, nor to the church of God; even as I please all men in all
   things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they
   may be saved.' This meek, holy, charitable converse to the glory of
   God, without offence and scandal, is that which promoteth God's
   kingdom; and this would Christ teach us in his own form and course of
   life, conversing in a sanctified manner with all sorts of persons to
   their profit and benefit.

   [5.] Because Christ would not gratify human wisdom: as he would not
   gratify sense by choosing a pompous life, so he would not gratify human
   wisdom by choosing an austere life. There are two sorts of men in the
   world who are not of God--the men of the world and the saints of this
   world. The men of the world are brutish sensualists, who are all for
   pomp and glory. Christ would not gratify these, but came meek and poor,
   to teach us humility, self-denial, and contentation: Mat. xi. 29, Learn
   of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.' He did not bustle in the
   world for respect and honour; his complaints of his enemies, and his
   answers to them, were full of meekness, and stood not to abase himself
   for the Father's glory and men's good: so he did not gratify the men of
   the world. The saints of this world are such as are strict in outward
   observances, in eating or not eating, in marrying or not marrying, in
   forbearing such company, in such a number and tale of devotions, in
   abstaining from such lawful things; these things the apostle saith have
   a show of wisdom,' Col. ii. 23. The world is mightily taken with bodily
   exercise and outward strictness. As the men of the world love to pamper
   the body, so the saints of this world needlessly afflict and dishonour
   the body; this hath a show, and nothing but a show: but Christ would
   not gratify these neither. He used a free, but a holy life, and so was
   censured and traduced as a wine-bibber and a glutton, to teach his
   followers to be contented to be judged according to men in the flesh,
   and live to God in the spirit,' 1 Peter iv. 6. He came to preach, and
   to give inward regeneration and renovation. To show the proper way of
   mortification, which is not by a severity of life, but by deadening the
   mind to the esteem of the world. That kind of life which consists in
   outward rigours hath some honour and reputation in the world, and
   maketh a fair show in the flesh; but he would teach us the life which
   consists in faith, holiness, sobriety, humility of mind, charity,
   obedience to God, joy in the spirit, and comfort of the promises, which
   the world liketh not so well. Outward and rigorous observances are more
   plausible, but the power of godliness, and a true sense of the world to
   come, the world hateth.

   [6.] To show us the true nature of mortification, which consists not in
   a bare abstinence and shameful retreat from temptations, but in a
   spirit fortified against them; not in a monkish discontent with the
   world, but a holy contempt of it when we most freely use it; and in
   bridling and governing the appetite and desire, rather than in
   scrupulous refraining from the object itself; in a using of the world,
   but not abusing of it, 1 Cor. vii. 31; not so much scrupling the
   comforts of the present life, as a valuing and esteeming the comforts
   of a better life; prizing more the Christian vow than any by-laws of
   our own. The apostle telleth us, 1 Tim. iv. 8, that bodily exercise
   profiteth little, but godliness is profitable to all things.'
   Abstinence from daily meats, wines, marriage, is an act of self-denial,
   but a very small one; for all the good it doth is to tame the members
   of the body, and its external motions and actions, without sanctifying
   the heart and inward part, as a lively faith, fear, and love of God
   doth. The profit of bodily exercise is little in comparison of inward
   piety, which is necessary to a comfortable life here, and a blessed
   hereafter.

   Thirdly, The observations which we may build thereon.

   1. We may observe the humanity, goodness, and kindness of that religion
   which we profess, both with respect to ourselves and others.

   [1.] Ourselves. Man consists of a body and a soul, and hath respects
   for either, else he were unnatural. The body, indeed, we are apt to
   overprize, and therefore we need not a spur but a bridle for our
   affections to the bodily life; and therefore religion, in the precepts
   of it, interposeth by way of restraint rather than exhortation: Titus
   ii. 12, That we should live soberly,' &c.; and Rom. xiii. 14, Make no
   provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.' Do not cherish
   carnal desires. The apostle telleth you, No man ever yet hated his own
   flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,' Eph. v. 29. Our usual fault
   is an excessive pampering of the flesh. Some have hated their own
   souls, at least, by consequence and interpretation; therefore we dare
   not let loose the reins, and give either encouragement or allowance to
   men to indulge their carnal desires; yet, to avoid prejudice, we must
   grant what may be granted, for men are apt to think that religion is a
   sour thing, and abridges them of all the comforts of their lives. No;
   besides the rich comforts it provideth for the soul, it alloweth and
   forbiddeth not so much sensitive pleasure as tendeth to the holiness of
   the soul, and furthereth us in God's service. It rebuketh and
   forbiddeth nothing but what really may be a snare to us; it considereth
   all things, meats, drinks, marriage, wealth, honours, and dignities of
   the present world, as they have respect to God and a better world, and
   as they help and hinder us in the pleasing God and seeking immortality.

   [2.] With respect to others. The spirit of our religion may be known by
   the example of our dearest Lord. It is not a proud, disdainful spirit,
   that refuseth the company of the meanest and worst, so we may do them
   good. He came to save sinners, and conversed with sinners. He came to
   redress the miseries of mankind, and went up and down doing good;
   though his familiarities were with the most godly, yet he disdained not
   the company of others. And surely his religion, where it prevaileth in
   the hearts of any, it causes them not only to deal justly with all, but
   to love all r all mankind, with a love of benevolence; it maketh us to
   long for the good of their souls, and desirous also to do good to the
   bodies of those that are in need. It is said, indeed, Prov. xxix. 27,
   An unjust man is an. abomination to the just; and he that is upright in
   the way is an abomination to the wicked.' But we must distinguish of
   the hatred of abomination, and the hatred of enmity. We hate our sinful
   neighbour, as we must ourselves much more, in opposition to the love of
   complacency, but not in opposition to the love of benevolence; so we
   must neither hate ourselves, nor our neighbour, no, nor our enemy. The
   business of your lives must be, to do good to all, especially to the
   household of faith. God's natural image is on all men, his spiritual
   image on his saints; and we must love God in: all his creatures,
   especially in. his children. This is true religion, consecrated by our
   Lord's example,

   2. We may observe, that an external holiness, which consisteth in an
   outside strictness, without that faith, love, charity, hope,
   usefulness, and activity which is the very soul and life of
   Christianity, usually puffeth up men with a vain conceit of their own
   righteousness, and a censuring and a despising of others. This text
   showeth us both the spirit of pharisaism and the spirit of
   Christianity. The pharisees, who abounded in outward observances,
   censured Christ for his free converses, and disdained those sinners
   whom he invited to a better life, Luke xviii. 9-12; and they were
   ignorant of true wisdom, which is justified, embraced, and received by
   all her children. Learn, then, that an unruly, fierce, censorious
   spirit, which is only borne up by external advantages, is not the right
   spirit of the gospel. True religion maketh men humble and low in their
   own eyes, acquainteth them with their desert, sin, and misery, and
   maketh them pitiful and compassionate to others, and more ready to help
   them than to censure them, and to use all ways and means to do them
   good.

   3. The main observation is this,--That a free life, guided by a holy
   wisdom, is the most sanctified life, and bringeth most honour to God,
   and is most useful to others.

   Here I shall show you;--

   1. Wherein lieth this free life, guided by holy wisdom.

   2. How it is the most sanctified life.

   1. Wherein lieth this free life, guided by holy wisdom. It is said of
   Enoch, Gen. v. 22, That he walked with God, and begat sons and
   daughters;' that is, dedicated himself to God's service, and lived in
   most strict holiness, And there you see the use of a conjugal life in
   its purity may stand with the strictest rules of holiness. So for
   worldly affairs, when the course of our calling engageth us in them, it
   is not using of the world, but over-using is the fault, 1 Cor. vii. 31.
   So for the comforts of this life: Ps. lxii. 10, If riches increase, set
   not your heart upon them.' The business is not to withdraw them away,
   but to withdraw the affection. So for the lawful delights, there are
   two extremes,--clogging and retrenching our liberty with outward burden
   some observances, or abusing our liberty to wantonness: Gal. v. 13, Ye
   are called to liberty, only use not your liberty as an occasion to the
   flesh,' Corrupt nature venteth itself both ways; either by
   superstitious rigours, or by breaking all bonds, and enlarging itself
   according to the licentiousness of the flesh. Meat, drink, apparel, are
   in their own nature indifferent; neither must superstition work upon
   them, nor profaneness; and in the mean between both lieth godliness.

   2. How it is the most sanctified life.

   [1.] Partly because it suiteth with the example of Christ. He came, as
   to expiate our offences, so to give us an example: 1 Peter ii. 21,
   Leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps;' and 1 John ii.
   6, Walk as he walked.' It is high presumption to aim at an imitation of
   Christ in those acts of his which he did for satisfying the Father's
   justice or proving his deity; yea, it is impossible to imitate him in
   those. Yet in actions moral we are bound to imitate him, and in actions
   indifferent, not to suffer our liberty to be straitened, but to govern
   circumstances according to that holy wisdom. Christ retired not from
   the society of men, but used the greatest freedom in a holy way.

   [2.] Because there is more true grace in being dead to the temptation,
   than to retreat from the temptation. A Christian is not to go out of
   the world, neither by a voluntary death, John xvii. 15, nor by an
   unnecessary sequestration of ourselves from business and the affairs
   which God calleth us to, 1 Cor. vii. 20, Let every man abide in the
   same calling wherein he was called;' but to be crucified to the world,
   Gal. vi. 14,--that is, grace to withdraw our hearts from the world,
   while we converse in it and with it. Many real Christians, when they
   hear us press mortification and deadness to the world, think they must
   leave their callings, or abate of their necessary activity in their
   callings. Alas! in the shop, a man may keep himself unspotted from the
   world, as well as in the closet; in a court, as well as in a cell. We
   read of saints in Nero's household, Phil, iv, 22. He was a great
   persecutor, yet some saints could live there, within his gates: there
   were some professors of the gospel. So Rev. ii, 13, I know thy works,
   and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou boldest
   fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein
   Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan
   dwelleth.' In the sorest and thickest of temptations a Christian may
   maintain his integrity. In short, our way to heaven lieth through the
   world; and though, if I be left to my choice, I should choose that
   course of life in which there are least temptations, yet when God, by
   the posture of our temporal interest, or the course of our education,
   or the nature of my employment and usefulness, hath determined me to a
   life more incident to a throng of temptations, I may the better venture
   upon them, and must not leave my service for supposed snares.
   Affectation of privacy may be a slothful retreat from public business,
   and it is more glorious to beat an enemy than to fly from him; and
   grace is seen in overcoming rather than in shunning difficulties.

   Well, then, learn from the whole, that true mortification consists in a
   change of the frame of heart; in a resolution against the baits' of
   sense, rather than removing our presence from them; in being not of the
   world, though we are in the world; not in casting away our enjoyments,
   but in an equal mind in all conditions, James i. 9, 10: that to be poor
   in abundance, humble in high places, temperate and godly in the freest
   course of life, is to imitate the life of Christ: that then we are
   properly mortified, when our esteem, value, and affection is mortified:
   that grace showeth itself more in choice than in necessity; in an
   abstinence from the delights of the flesh when we have them, rather
   than when we want them: that we may follow our business and yet be
   godly: that the overcharging of the heart is the great evil that we
   should beware of; that we may use company, but not to partake of their
   sins; yea, to make them better, and to purify them by our example.

   I now proceed to the last clause: But wisdom is justified of her
   children.

   We have observed:--

   1. The different form and course of life wherein John and Jesus
   appeared.

   2. Their censures of both.

   3. The receiving of the gospel by the unprejudiced.

   In this last observe:--

   [1.] The exceptive particle, but. Though undeserved censures are cast
   upon the ways of God, yet at length there is a wisdom found in them.
   Ignorant men mistake them, carnal men slight them, the profane snuff at
   them, few or none entertain them with that respect they ought to do,
   yet this wisdom will not want advocates.

   [2.] The thing spoken of, wisdom. By wisdom is meant the doctrine of
   the gospel, called elsewhere the counsel of God, as appeareth by the
   parallel place, Luke vii. 29, 30, And all the people that heard him
   justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. But the
   pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves.'
   The gospel method of salvation is there called the counsel of God, be
   cause it is the counsel he giveth men for their good; as here wisdom,
   because it is the result of God's eternal wisdom and decrees. And
   elsewhere the doctrine of Christ crucified is called the wisdom of
   God;' and again, 1 Cor. ii. 7, the wisdom of God in a mystery.'

   [3.] What is said of it, or how it is used; it is justified.
   Justification is a relative word: as it is opposed to crimination, so
   to justify is the work of an advocate; as to condemnation, so it is the
   work of a judge. The children of wisdom discharge both parts, chiefly
   the first; they bear witness to their faith, or the doctrine of God
   concerning salvation by Christ, by .their profession and godly life and
   ready obedience, and exalt it so much as others .decry it, and every
   way manifest they hold it for good and right; .only, this pleading is
   real, not by word but deed: Sapientia non quaerit vocis, testimonium
   sed operum, saith Hierom. Divine wisdom is justified more by works than
   by a verbal plea. Wisdom's children hear her instructions, follow her
   directions and institutes, and with diligence observe the way of
   salvation prescribed by God, though others slight it; and so justify it
   against the exceptions and reproaches of the carnal world.

   [4.] Of whom: of her children. The children of wisdom are the
   professors of it; those who are begotten by God by the word of truth,
   James i. 18, and are willing to attain the end by the ways and means
   wherein God affordeth it. These are Wisdom's children, begotten, bred
   up, and instructed by her; it is an Hebraism, as children of wrath,'
   children of light,' children of this world,' and the like; the
   professors and followers of the gospel.

   The point that I shall insist on is this:--

   That the wisdom of God, leading men to salvation, in the ways and means
   pointed out in the gospel, is and should be justified of all the
   sincere professors of it.

   In managing this point, I shall show you:--

   First, What is the wisdom of God in the way of salvation prescribed by
   the gospel.

   Secondly, That this wisdom is despised, slighted, and contradicted by
   the carnal world, and why.

   Thirdly, How and why it must be justified by the sincere professors of
   the gospel.

   First, What is the wisdom of God in the way of salvation prescribed by
   the gospel? The sum of the gospel is this: that all those who, by true
   repentance and faith, do forsake the flesh, the world, and the devil,
   and give themselves up to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as
   their creator, redeemer, and sanctifier, shall find God as a father,
   taking them for his reconciled children, and for Christ's sake
   pardoning their sins, and by his Spirit giving them his grace; and, if
   they persevere in this course, will finally glorify them, and bestow
   upon them everlasting happiness; but will condemn the unbelievers,
   impenitent, and ungodly to everlasting punishment. That this is the sum
   of the gospel appeareth by Mark xvi. 15, 16: Go, preach the gospel to
   every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but
   he that believeth not shall be damned;' where you have all the
   Christian religion laid before you in one short view and prospect. It
   concerneth either the end or the means.

   1. The end. The apostle telleth you that God hath brought life and
   immortality to light in the gospel,' 2 Tim. i. 10; or clearly
   discovered a happiness and a misery in the world to come.

   2. .The means. He hath pointed out a sure way for obtaining the one and
   avoiding the other. As to the means, Christian religion is
   considerable, either as to the entrance or the progress of it. Our Lord
   telleth us, Mat. vii. 14, Strait is the gate and narrow is the way
   which leadeth unto life.' He speaketh of a gate and a way. The gate
   noteth the entrance; the way, the progress therein. In other scriptures
   we read of making covenant with God, and keeping covenant with God: the
   covenant must not only be made, but kept. So again we read of
   dedication and use; of devotedness to God, and faithfulness to him; of
   our purpose and progress, choice and course; all which expressions tend
   to the same effect.

   [1.] As to the way of entering into covenant with God, there is
   required:--

   (1.) True repentance and faith: Repentance towards God, and faith in
   our Lord Jesus Christ,' Acts xx. 21. Repentance respects God as our
   end, and faith respects Christ as Mediator, as the only way of
   returning to God, from whom we have strayed by our own folly and sin.

   (2.) In the exercise of this repentance and faith, there must be a
   forsaking the devil, the world, and the flesh, and a giving up
   ourselves to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as our creator,
   redeemer, and sanctifier. For the former, there are three great enemies
   to God and us--the devil, the world, and the flesh; reckoned up, Eph.
   ii. 2, 3, In time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
   after the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh
   in the children of disobedience: among whom also we all had our
   conversation in times past, in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the
   desires of the flesh and of the mind.' There all your enemies appear
   abreast: the devil as the grand deceiver and principle of all
   wickedness; the world with its pleasures, honours, and profits, as the
   bait by which the devil would deceive us, and steal away our hearts
   from God, and divert us from looking after the one thing necessary; the
   flesh, as the corrupt inclination in us, which entertaineth and closeth
   with these temptations, to the neglect of God, and wrong of our own
   souls. This is importunate to be pleased, and is the proper internal
   cause of all our mischief; for every man is enticed and drawn away by
   his own lusts. Now these must be renounced before we can return to God
   by Jesus Christ; for, as Joshua told the Israelites, so must we say to
   all of you: Josh. xxiv. 23, Put away the strange gods which are among
   you, and incline your heart to the Lord God of Israel.'

   First, There must be a renouncing of our idols before our hearts can
   incline unto the true God. We must be turned from. Satan to God, Acts
   xx. 18. And the world must be renounced, Titus ii. 12: Denying all
   ungodliness and worldly lusts.' And we must not look upon ourselves as
   debtors to the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, Rom. viii. 10. God
   will have no copartners and competitors in our hearts.

   And then the second part, in exercising of our faith and repentance, is
   giving up ourselves to God the Father, Son, and Spirit, as our creator,
   redeemer, and sanctifier. And therefore in baptism, which is our first
   entrance and initiation into the Christian religion, we are baptized in
   the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Mat. xxviii. 19, which
   implieth a dedication and giving up ourselves to them, according to
   their personal relations. To the Father, as our creator, to love him,
   obey him, and depend upon him, and be happy in his love as dear
   children. To Christ as our Redeemer, to free us from the guilt of sin
   and the wrath of God. To the Holy Ghost, to guide and sanctify us, and
   comfort us with the sense of our present interest in God's love, and
   the hopes of future glory.

   [2.] As to our progress and perseverance, which is our walking in the
   narrow way, three things are required; and that--

   (1.) As to the enemies of God and our souls. As there is a renouncing
   required at first, so at length there is requisite an overcoming the
   devil, the world, and the flesh: Rev. ii. 7, To him that overcometh
   will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
   paradise of God.' We overcome the devil when we keep up our resistance,
   and stand out against his batteries and assaults: 1 Peter v. 8, 9, Be
   sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
   lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast
   in the faith.' We overcome the world when the terrors and allurements
   of it have less force and influence upon us: 1 John v. 4, 5, Whatsoever
   is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that over
   cometh the world, even our faith: who is he that overcometh the world,
   but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?' and Gal. vi. 14,
   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.'
   We overcome and subdue the flesh when we have crucified the flesh with
   the affections and lusts,' Gal. v 24; when we get the mastery over the
   passions and affections thereof; and though we be sometimes foiled, yet
   the drift and bent of our lives is for God and our salvation.

   (2.) As to God, to whom we have devoted ourselves. We must love him
   above all, and not put him off with what the flesh can spare, or the
   world will allow, or the devil will suffer us to go on contentedly
   with; but we must serve him sincerely, in holiness and righteousness
   all our days,' Luke i. 75. The love and patient service of our Creator
   is our great and daily work.

   (3.) As to our end. We must live in the nope of the coming of Christ
   and our everlasting glory: Titus ii. 13, Looking for that blessed hope,
   and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ,' and Jude, ver. 21, Keep yourselves in the love of God. looking
   for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.' Well, then,
   as we did at first thankfully accept of our recovery by Christ, and did
   at first renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and consented to
   follow his direction, and use his means in order to our final
   happiness, so we must still persevere in this mind and resolution, till
   our glory come in hand. This is God's wisdom.

   Secondly, Let us now see how this counsel of God is entertained by the
   carnal world. It is there despised, slighted, and contradicted. The
   world is a distracted world; some neglect God's counsel and never lay
   it to heart: Heb. ii. 3, How shall we escape if we neglect so great
   salvation?' and Mat. xxii. 5, But they made light of it, and went their
   ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.' Some laugh at these
   things, and make a holy and heavenly life the matter of their scorn and
   derision: Luke xvi. 14, The pharisees also, who were covetous, heard
   all these things, and they derided him;' and Acts xvii. 32, Some
   mocked, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter;
   howbeit, certain men clave unto him and believed.' There are others who
   fasten odious reproaches on the godly. And though the Christian
   religion be so holy and innocent in its design, so agreeable to the
   nature of God and man, so well contrived to remedy our miseries, and to
   secure our true and proper happiness, yet the strictness of it is
   distasted by the world. By the profane, who have nothing to excuse
   their wickedness, it is counted hypocrisy: As deceivers, yet true,' 2
   Cor. vi. 8; because they cannot condemn the life, they judge the heart.
   By them who affect the vanities of the world, and have a passionate
   love for the pleasures and honours thereof; because the generality of
   the world are of that mind, they brand it with the imputation of
   foolish singularity. And the carnal politicians, because it was never
   yet so well with the world, but some things which God requireth are
   discountenanced, they tax it of disobedience, and they counted Paul as
   a mover of sedition, Acts xxv. 5; and because the operations of grace
   are above the line of nature, others tax it of fanaticism and
   enthusiasm. Atheists, .who are all for demonstrations of sense, sight,
   and present things, because Christianity mainly inviteth to things
   spiritual and heavenly, and to live upon the hopes of an unseen world
   that is yet to come, they judge it to be a foppery, or mere imposture,
   or needless superstition. Though both the hopes and precepts of
   religion carry a marvellous compliance with right reason, yet none of
   these things move them. Lastly, There are others that malign, oppose,
   and oppugn holiness. There is an everlasting enmity between the two
   seeds, as between the wolf and the lamb, the raven and the dove; the
   world will love its own, and hate those that go a contrary course, John
   xv. 19; And as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was
   born after the spirit, even so it is now,' Gal. iv. 29; and so it will
   be to the end of the world. When the powers of the world give any rest,
   yet the carnal seed will be mocking and scoffing, and bringing God's
   holy ways into contempt, branding them with censures and calumnies. The
   reasons of this are partly because men are drunk with the delusions of
   the flesh, and so cannot judge of spiritual things; partly to excuse
   themselves. Men will be quarrelling at religion when they have no mind
   to practise it, and dispute away duties when they are unwilling to
   perform them; partly, they take occasion from the failings of God's
   people, though there is no reason why they should do so. An art should
   not be condemned for the workman's want of skill; but they do so. If
   Christians be serious to any degree of sadness, then religion is
   counted an uncomfortable thing, it mopeth them. If there be any
   differences among God's people, because of their several degrees of
   light, oh, then there are so many sects, and factions, and
   controversies about religion, they suspect all, and are true to none.
   If any creep into the holy profession, and pollute it with their,
   scandals, then all strictness in religion is but a pretence and
   imposture. If men be strict, and would avoid every ordinary failing
   incident to mankind, then they are more nice than wise, and this is
   preciseness and indiscretion. It were end less to rake in this puddle,
   and to reckon up all the cavils and exceptions which naughty men
   commence against the ways of God.

   Thirdly, How and why it must be justified by the sincere professors of
   the gospel.

   1. How?

   I answer--Three ways:--

   [1.] It must be approved and received by themselves. It is wisdom's
   children that can only justify wisdom; they that have entertained it,
   felt the power and force of it in their own hearts; yea, their very
   receiving is a justifying; they show the clamourings of the world do
   not move them: therefore it must be approved by us before it can be
   recommended to others, and approved, not speculatively only, but
   practically, so as to resolve to follow after salvation in this way.
   {Speculatively, they may approve it that have butmo'rphosin tes
   gno'seos, Rom. ii. 18, 20; a form of knowledge, and dishonour it in
   their practices, as ver. 23, 24. Men may justify religion in word, by a
   bare naked approbation, and soundly vindicate it from the cavils and
   exceptions of men; but godly men have eyes to see the beauty and
   excellence of it, and have sincerely accepted it: Acts ii. 41, They
   received the word gladly.' It is good news to a poor guilty conscience
   to hear of a pardoning God and a merciful and faithful Redeemer, the
   promise of eternal life, and a sure way how to come to it. They are
   said to justify God that accepted his counsel, Luke vii. 29, 30. The
   hearts of God's children are thoroughly possessed with the reality,
   excellency, and blessedness of this religion; they know and believe the
   infinite consequence of these things; their faith is a kind of
   justifying: John iii. 33, He that hath received his testimony, hath set
   to his seal that God is true.'

   [2.] It must be professed and owned when it is vilified and in contempt
   and disgrace in the world. We must stand to Christ and his ways, though
   we stand alone, as Elijah, 1 Kings xix. 10, and not be ashamed of
   holiness, notwithstanding trouble and contradiction. Christ will be
   confessed before men, and will be ashamed before God and angels of them
   who are ashamed of him in the world, and refuse to own him and his ways
   and truths, only because they are despised and contradicted and
   discountenanced in the world. Pleading for religion is one of the
   professing acts: 2 Cor. iv. 13, We having the same spirit of faith,
   according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we
   also believe, and therefore speak.' As David, when sore afflicted, did
   confess and avow his confidence in God, so we, heartily believing and
   approving the gospel, must make a bold profession of it. The sacraments
   were ordained for this purpose, for badges of profession. Baptism is a
   visible entering into covenant with God: Mark xvi. 16, He that
   believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; and he that believeth not
   shall be damned;' where not only belief is required, but open
   profession. Baptism is a badge and a bond; a badge to distinguish the
   worshippers of Christ from others, and a bond to bind us to open
   profession of the name of Christ. The Lord's Supper it is a profession
   of communion: 1 Cor. x. 16, The cup of blessing which we bless, is it
   not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is
   it not the communion of the body of Christ?' and ver. 18, Are not they
   which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?' They that did any
   part of the sacrifices did eat and drink with God at the altar; and
   ver. 20, 21, I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. Ye
   cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye cannot be
   partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils,' Professing
   communicating with Christ is not consistent with professing
   communicating with devils. So prayer and praise is a part of
   confessing: Rom. x. 10, With the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.'
   The first is proved ver. 11, For the scripture saith, Whosoever
   believeth on him shall not be ashamed;' the second, ver. 13, For
   whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.' Calling
   upon the name of the Lord in prayer and praise, it is an open
   professing act, by which we own God in Christ for our God. So the
   assembling ourselves together for public worship is a part of this
   profession, and must not be omitted for fear: Heb. x. 23, with 25, Let
   us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering.' How? ver.
   25, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner
   of some is.' These assemblies were instituted for public converse with
   God, testifying their union and agreement in the same faith and
   worship. Indeed, in lesser truths, that fall within the latitude of
   allowable differences in the church, profession is not always a duty,
   for in some cases we may have faith to ourselves; but a denying of God,
   or being ashamed of him, is always a sin. When called to give an
   account, we are with boldness to own our profession: Acts iv. 10, Be it
   known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name
   of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from
   the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole;' and
   Dan. iii. 17, 18, If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to
   deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out
   of thy hand, O king; but if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we
   will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
   set up.'

   [3.] This profession must be honoured, and recommended to others, by a
   holy conversation. But now, what kind of conversation honoureth
   religion?

   (1.) Such as is carried on with diligence and seriousness. As Noah,
   Heb. xi. 7, By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as
   yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by
   the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
   which is by faith.' They behaved themselves as those that in earnest
   believed a flood, when they made such thorough preparation, which was a
   just reproof to the security and incredulity of the carnal world: when
   we do as we say, in good earnest make preparation for another world,
   otherwise religion is but suspected as a vain pretence and empty talk.
   Then we look after heaven indeed, then we believe it when we do the
   things that belief bindeth us unto. A carnal man that is all talk and
   no practice, he doth not religion so much honour in his words as he
   doth dishonour it in his works. He liveth down his profession, while he
   seemeth to cry it up: Titus i. 16, They profess that they know God, but
   in works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto
   every good work reprobate.' Contrary motions are an implicit denial of
   the faith, 1 Tim. v. 8; but laziness and negligence do also foment and
   breed atheism; and we carry on the life of godliness coldly and
   faintly, and so our conversations, which should be a confirmation of
   the gospel, prove a confutation rather. Those that are disciples in
   name only, the word of God cometh to them in word only. The careless
   practiser is as bad as he that is haunted with actual doubts about the
   truth of Christianity. The troubled doubter mindeth his business, but
   these never regard it, and do in effect say that Christ and his
   salvation is not worth the looking after. As it is said of the
   Israelites, Ps. cvi. 24, They despised the good land, they believed not
   his word.' Those that resolved to give over the pursuit of Canaan are
   said to doubt of his promise. So they that neglect salvation do not
   believe the truth of it, Heb. ii. 3, 4; and though they talk high, they
   secretly propagate their infidelity. The strength of our faith should
   appear by the diligence of our lives, the seriousness of our
   endeavours, and the fervour of our duties. Practices do more express
   the image of our minds than words. The faith that issueth out into
   works doth most commend itself to others: 2 Thes. i. 11, 12, That you
   may fulfil the work of faith with power; that Christ Jesus may be
   glorified in you, and you in him.' Then is Christ glorified, when you
   live answerably to your profession, and do by the power of God carry on
   a holy life upon the encouragements of the promises of the gospel.

   (2.) Such as is governed by the respects of the other world. When we
   are patient and joyful under the cross, and full of hope and comfort in
   great straits, and delight in our work, which the world hateth and
   discountenanceth, and hope against hope, and live in the promises: Ps.
   cxix. 111, Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for
   they are the rejoicing of my heart.' Then we justify wisdom, and
   commend our faith to others. God was angry with Moses and Aaron: Num.
   xx. 12, Because ye believed not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the
   children of Israel.' We are not only firmly to believe ourselves, but
   to sanctify him in the eyes of others; and that is done by the labour
   of our faith, the patience of our hope, our joyfulness and delight in
   God. when we have but little in hand, and the readiness of our
   obedience even under deep sufferings. When the Thessalonians had
   received the word in much assurance and much affliction, and much joy
   in the Holy Ghost, the apostle telleth, 1 Thes. i. 5-7, They were
   ensamples to all that believed in Achaia and Macedonia,' and from them
   sounded out the word of God to other places.' Thus we propagate our
   faith, and commend the truth of God to others. The life of faith is a
   glorious thing, but the life of sense or reason hath no glory in it, or
   a life carried on merely upon external probabilities. When we can
   contemn this world, both the good and evil things of it, in hopes of a
   better, and part with all that is dear to us in this world upon the
   conscience of our duty, then we justify wisdom.

   (3.) By an exact purity and holiness, or a full conformity to all God's
   precepts and institutes, and by a faithful discharging all duties to
   God and men. Every true Christian should be a transcript of his
   religion: 2 Cor. iii. 3, Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle
   of Christ, written not with ink, but with the Spirit.' An epistle is
   that wherein a man hath written his mind; our conversations should be
   religion exemplified, a real sermon: Phil. ii. 16, Holding forth the
   word of life.' The wax hath an impression and stamp left upon it
   according to what is engraven upon the seal. Then we honour religion
   when the impression and print of it is left upon our hearts and lives,
   and we are cast into this mould. More particularly, duties of
   relations, which are visible and easily observed, justify and honour
   religion: Titus ii. 10, and 1 Peter ii. 15, So is the will of God, that
   with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.'
   These conduce to the good of human societies, are most regarded, and
   make the ways of God amiable. Thus how wisdom is to be justified.

   I now come to show you--

   2. Why.

   [1.] Because of the charge that is put upon us to testify for God, and
   justify his ways: Isa. xliii. 10, Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord.'
   They that are most acquainted with God can most witness for him. So
   wisdom's children can most justify her. They are acquainted with her
   promises and precepts, and have experience of the virtue and power of
   them in comforting and changing the heart. A report of a report is a
   cold thing; they that have felt somewhat in their hearts, that which
   they have seen and felt they can speak of. The world needeth some
   witnesses for God, some testimony and preparative inducement to invite
   them to embrace the ways of God. Miracles served for that use
   heretofore: Acts v. 32, And we are his witnesses of those things, and
   so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.'
   And in the place of miracles, there succeeded good conversation, or the
   wonderful effects of his Spirit. Grace in the heart and lives of his
   children, this is apt to beget wonder, as miracles did, 1 Peter iv. 4.
   When they can renounce the lusts which most are mastered by, and grow
   dead to worldly interests, live in the world above the world, in the
   flesh contrary to the flesh. A miracle strikes a little wonderment at
   first, but this sinketh and soaketh to the heart. When men are so
   strictly holy, so ravishingly heavenly, and bear up upon the hopes and
   encouragements of the other world, and are so conscientious in all
   duties to God and man, you show that religion is not a notion or an
   imagination.

   [2.] Wisdom deserveth to be justified by us. What is there in all the
   Christian religion but what is justifiable, or that we should be
   ashamed of? Is it the hopes of it? The hopes of it are such as are fit
   to be propounded to man, sought after by all the world, but nowhere
   discovered with such certainty and distinctness as in the gospel
   Nothing doth refine and ennoble the heart so much as these hopes. The
   heavenly spirit, that can support itself with the hopes of an unseen
   glory, is the only true sublime spirit; an earthly spirit is a base
   spirit, so a sensual, the dregs of mankind. Amongst men, the ambitious,
   who aspire to crowns and kingdoms, and aim at perpetual fame by their
   heroic virtues and exploits, are judged persons of far greater
   gallantry than covetous muckworms or brutish epicures; yet they are
   poor, base-spirited people in their highest thoughts and designs to
   that noble and divine spirit which worketh in the breast of those who
   sincerely and heartily seek heavenly things. For what is the honour of
   the world to approbation with God, temporal trifles to an everlasting
   kingdom? Is it the way and means, the first, the terms of settling our
   souls in the way of faith end repentance? What more rational? Should we
   return to our creator's service without acknowledging our offence in
   straying, or humbling ourselves for our errors, and purposing for the
   future to live in his love and obedience? Or can we expect mercy
   without returning? Reason will say our case is not compassionable. Or
   should God quit his law without satisfaction? Or should we not own our
   benefactor, the person satisfying? Certainly there is nothing more
   reasonable. So also for new obedience. Therefore wisdom deserveth to be
   justified by us.

   [3.] Those that condemn wisdom, yet do in some measure at the same time
   justify it. They condemn it with their tongues, but justify it with
   their consciences: they hate and fear strictness: Mark vi. 20, Herod
   feared John, because he was a just man and a holy, and observed him.'
   They scoff at it with their tongues, but have a fear of it in their
   consciences: they revile at it while they live, but what mind are they
   of when they come to die? Then all will speak well of a holy life, and
   the strictest obedience to the laws of God: Num. xxiii. 10, Let me die
   the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his;' and Mat.
   xxv. 8, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.' Oh that they
   had a little of that holiness and strictness which they scoffed at,
   whilst they were pursuing their lusts! How will they desire to die? As
   carnal and careless sinners, or as mortified saints? They approve it in
   thesi, and condemn it in hypothesi. All the opposers and scoffers at
   godliness, within the pale of the visible church, have the same Bible,
   baptism, creed, and pretend to believe in the same God and Christ,
   which they own with those whom they oppose. All the difference is, the
   one are real Christians, the other are nominal; some profess at large,
   others practise what they profess; the one have a religion to talk of,
   the other to live by; they approve it in the form, but hate it in the
   power. A picture of Christ that is drawn by a painter they like, and
   the forbidden image of God made by a carver they will reverence and
   honour, and be zealous for; but the image of God framed by the Spirit
   in the hearts of the faithful, and described in the lives of the
   heavenly and the sanctified, this they scorn and scoff at.

   [4.] If we do not justify religion, we justify the world. It must needs
   be so, for these two are opposites, the carnal world and wisdom: the
   carnal world must be condemned, and religion justified, or religion
   will be condemned and the world justified. Some condemn the world: Heb.
   xi. 7, By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
   moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by the
   which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
   which is by faith.' Some justify the world, as Israel justified Sodom:
   Ezek. xvi. 51, But thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than
   they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which
   thou hast done.' Their sin seemeth more excusable; you either upbraid
   their security and carelessness, or countenance it by your own
   practice; your seriousness is a real rebuke to the carnal world; your
   working out your salvation in fear and trembling upbraideth their
   security and carelessness; your rejoicing in God condemneth their
   carnal delight. When you are troubled about a vain thought, and are
   watchful against a light word, you condemn them for their looseness and
   wallowing in all filthiness: but if not, you justify the world, and
   harden the wicked in their prejudices, and cause them to hold up their
   course with the greater pretence. When you are wrathful, proud,
   sensual, turbulent, self-seeking, you are an occasion of stumbling unto
   them. Cyprian, in his book De Duplici Martyrio, bringeth in the
   heathens thus speaking: Ecce qui jactant se redemptos à tyrannide
   Sathanae, qui praedicant se mortuos mundo, nihilo minus vincuntur à
   cupiditatibus suis, quam nos quos dicunt teneri sub regno Sathanae.
   Quid prodest illis baptismus, quid prodest Spiritus Sanctus, cujus
   arbitrio dicunt se temperari? &c.--Behold those that boast themselves
   to be redeemed from the tyranny of the devil, to be dead to the world,
   to have crucified the flesh: they are overcome by their base and
   brutish lusts, even as we are, whom they account to be still under the
   kingdom of the devil. What doth their baptism profit them? what the
   Holy Ghost, whose direction they profess to live by? Why should we
   trouble ourselves about changing our course, which is as good as
   theirs?' So in Salvian's time, the heathens were wont to upbraid the
   Christians thus: Ubi est Catholica lex quam credunt? Ubi sunt pietatis,
   et castitatis exempla quae discunt? Evangelia legunt et impudici sunt.
   Apostolos audiunt, et inebriantur, Christum sequuntur, et capiunt,
   &c.--They talk of a holy Christ, and yet are unjust, unclean, wrathful,
   covetous; of a meek patient Christ, and yet are rapacious and violent;
   of holy apostles, and yet are impure in their conversations.' Our
   author goeth on thus: Sancta à Christianis fierent, si Sancta Christus
   docuisset; aestimari à cultoribus potest iste qui colitur, quomodo
   bonus magister, cujus tam malos esse videmus discipulos?--If their
   Christ were a holy, meek Christ, they would be better,' &c. And as
   carnal men now speak, For all their godliness and religion that they
   talk of, our life, and course, and dealings are as good, and honest,
   and justifiable as theirs.' Thus the wicked are justified in their way.

   [5.] Christ will one day justify all his sincere followers before men,
   and angels, and devils: Luke xii. 8, Whosoever shall confess me, him
   shall the Son of man confess before the angels of God.' Let us justify
   his ways, and he will justify us, and our faith at length shall be
   found to praise, and glory, and honour. Christ will then wipe off all
   the aspersions which be cast upon the children of wisdom for
   godliness-sake, as faction, pride, singularity, hypocrisy; and that
   which was branded with such ignominious titles, will then be found to
   be the very wisdom of God.

   [6.] Because of the necessity of justifying wisdom in the times we live
   in. It is said, 2 Peter iii. 3, In the last time there shall come
   scoffers and mockers, walking after their own lusts.' The last days
   shall be full of these profane scoffers. While truths were new, and the
   exercises of the Christian religion lovely, there was great concord and
   seriousness amongst the professors of the gospel, and then profane
   scoffers were rare and unfrequent. Before men's senses were benumbed
   with the customary use of religious duties, the notions of God were
   fresh and lively upon their hearts; but afterwards, when the profession
   of Christianity grew into a form and national interest, and men were
   rather made Christians by the chance of their birth than choice and
   rational convictions, then the church was much pestered with this kind
   of cattle. Especially now are they rife among us, who live in the dregs
   of Christianity, when men are grown weary of the name of Christ, and
   the ancient severity and strictness is much lost, and the memory of
   those miracles and wonderful effects by which our religion was
   confirmed is almost worn out, or else questioned by men of subtle wits
   and a prostituted conscience. Therefore now mockers and men of
   atheistical spirits swarm everywhere, and it concerneth wisdom's
   children to justify it, and to maintain its former vigour and power.

   The use that we may make is double:--

   1. To the enemies of wisdom. Judge not of a holy life, and those that
   profess it, at a distance and by hearsay, but try. We are not afraid to
   come to the bar with our enemies: John vii. 24, Judge not according to
   appearance, but judge righteous judgment.' If men would not be blinded
   with visible appearance, and the mask of passion, prejudice, and
   interest, and condemn the people of God as they are represented in a
   false mirror; judge and spare not, and where you find the true spirit
   of Christianity, take all leave, we desire no other trial; but speak
   not against things you know not. Try, and judge as you find, where is
   the deepest sense of the other world, where the most careful
   preparation to get thither, the joy of faith, the love of holiness. If
   Christianity will allow that worldly pomp, that vanity and liberty,
   which others take, then judge the servants of the Lord as guilty of a
   foolish niceness, preciseness, and singularity; but if we be baptized
   into these things, and unquestionably and indispensably bound to them,
   either renounce your baptism, or forbear your censures, or rather
   choose this clear and pure way to everlasting glory. If you will not
   stand to God's word, stand to your own sober moods. We will make you
   yourselves judges, when you are serious and best able to judge of
   things, not in your passion, when lusts are stirring. When you are
   entering the confines of eternity, when conscience is likely to speak
   truth to you, you will wish then you were one of those poor godly men
   whom now you count proud, humorous, and factious.

   2. To the children of wisdom. Do not scandalise the holy ways of God,
   but justify them; be neither ashamed of them, nor a shame to them; till
   the ancient strictness be revived, wisdom will never be justified.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST MUST
EXPECT TROUBLES IN THIS WORLD.

   And it came to pass, that as they went in the way, a certain man said
   unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus
   said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but
   the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. And he said unto
   another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury
   my father. Jesus said unto them, Let the dead bury their dead; but go
   thou and preach the kingdom of God. And another also said, Lord, I will
   follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at
   my house. And Jesus said unto him, No man having put his hand to the
   plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.--Luke IX.
   57-62.

   HERE are three stories put together by the evangelist, to teach us in
   what manner we should address ourselves to follow Christ.

   The first is of a scribe that came uncalled, but his heart was not
   right with God, having a temporal bias upon it.

   The second is of one called, Luke 9:59. Christ saith, Follow me.' But
   he would first cherish, then bury, his dying father. But Christ would
   have no delays, but presently sets him about his ministry and service
   in the gospel. This, upon the authority of Clemens Alexandrinus, who
   received it upon ancient tradition, is supposed to be Philip.

   A third offereth himself to follow Christ; but first he would take his
   farewell at home, and compose matters in his family. But when we set
   our faces Godward, there is no looking back; there must be no more
   consulting with flesh and blood; the divine instinct must be obeyed
   speedily, and wholly, and Christ followed without reserves and
   conditions.

   Of these in their order.

   I begin with the first: And it came to pass, as they went on the way, a
   certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
   goest,' &c.

   In which words observe:--

   1. The time: It came to pass, as they went on the way, a certain man
   said to him.'

   2. A resolution professed: Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
   goest.

   3. Christ's reply: And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and the
   birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay
   his head.

   1. The time. In Mat. viii. 19, it is when Christ had a mind to retire,
   and had declared his purpose to go into the desert; in Luke, when he
   steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. Both may agree; the one
   more immediately, the other more remotely; first to the desert, then to
   Jerusalem. About that time, a certain man, seeing Christ about to
   remove from the place where he then was, offereth himself to be one of
   his disciples. This certain man is by St Matthew said to be a scribe.
   Men of that rank and order had usually a male talent [14] against the
   gospel, and are frequently coupled with the pharisees, men covetous and
   of a bitter spirit. This man seeing Christ did great miracles, and
   hoping that he would set up a temporal kingdom, he puts in for a place
   betimes that he might share in the honours of it.

   2. Here is a resolution professed: Lord, I will follow thee
   whithersoever thou goest.' Where take notice--

   [1.] Of the ready forwardness of the scribe. He was not called by
   Christ, but offered himself of his own accord.

   [2.] Observe the largeness of the offer, and unboundedness of it,
   whithersoever;' as indeed it is our duty to follow Christ through thick
   and thin. In the Revelation, Christ's undefiled company are described
   to be such as follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth,' Rev. xiv. 4;
   that is, obeyed him, though to their great peril and loss. Well, then,
   here is readiness, here is largeness; it is well if all be sincere.
   Therefore let us see--

   3. Christ's answer and reply: And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have
   holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not
   where to lay his head.' By the tenor of Christ's answer, you may know
   what ails him, and on what foot he limped; for this is spoken either by
   way of preparation to enable him to keep his resolution, or rather by
   way of probation, to try the truth and strength of it; whether it were
   sincere and sound; yea or nay: as the young man was tried, Mark x. 21,
   One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
   to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, and take
   up thy cross, and follow me. But he went away sad at that saying.' So
   here, we hear no more of this scribe; our Lord knew how to discover
   hypocrites. Two things were defective in this resolution:--

   [1.] It was sudden and rash, not weighing the difficulties. They that
   rashly leap into a profession, usually fall back at the first trial.
   Therefore we must sit down and count the charges, Luke xiv. 28.

   [2.] There was a carnal aim in it. He minded his own profit and honour;
   therefore Christ in effect telleth him, You had best consider what you
   do, for following of me will be far from advancing any temporal
   interest of yours. The scribe was leavened with a conceit of a worldly
   kingdom, and had an eye to some temporal advantage; therefore Christ
   telleth him plainly, There was no worldly ease and riches to be
   expected from him; and so, Non repulit volentem; sed fingentem
   prodidit--He did not discourage a willing follower, but discover a
   worldly hypocrite,' saith Chrysologus.

   The doctrine we learn from hence is this:--

   They that will sincerely follow Christ, must not look for any great
   matters in the world, but rather prepare themselves to run all hazards
   with him.

   This is evident:--

   1. From Christ's own example; and the same mind should be in all his
   followers: John xvii. 16, They are not of the world, even as I am not
   of the world.' Our estranging of our hearts from the world is an
   evidence of our conformity to Christ. Christ passed through the world
   to sanctify it as a place of service; but his constant residence was
   not here, to fix it as a place of rest: and all that are Christ's are
   alike affected. We pass through as strangers, but are not at home as
   inhabitants or dwellers; and if we have little of the world's favour,
   it is enough if any degree of service for God.

   2. From the nature of his kingdom. His kingdom is not of this world,
   John xviii. 3, 6. It is not a kingdom of pomp, but a kingdom of
   patience. Here we suffer with Christ, hereafter we reign with him. The
   comforts are not earthly, or the good things of this world, but
   heavenly--the good things of the world to come. This was the scribe's
   mistake.

   3. From the spirit of Christ. His spirit is given us to draw us off
   from this world to that which is to come: 1 Cor. ii. 12, Now we have
   not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God,
   that we may know the things which are given us of God.' The spirit of
   the world is that which possesseth and governeth worldly men, and
   inclineth them to a worldly happiness; this is in all men naturally.
   Corrupt nature doth sufficiently prompt and incline men to look after
   the honours, and pleasures, and profits of this world. James iii. 15,
   the apostle, when he would describe the wisdom which is not from above,
   he saith, that it is earthly, sensual, devilish; this wisdom cometh not
   from above.' Present things are known by sense, and known easily, and
   known by all. But there is a divine Spirit put into Christians, which
   inclineth them to things to come, and worketh graces suitable: some of
   which give us a sight of the truth of those things, as faith; some, a
   taste or an esteem of them, as love; some an earnest desire, as hope.
   This Spirit cometh from God and Christ, Eph. i. 17, 18. And without
   these graces we can have no sight nor desire of heavenly things: 1 Cor.
   ii. 14, The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
   for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because
   they are spiritually discerned.' They think it is folly to hazard
   present conveniencies for future rewards, and the truest wisdom to live
   in ease, plenty, and honour. On the contrary, the divine Spirit
   convinceth us that there is no such business of importance as looking
   after eternal life; that all the gay things of sense are but so many
   May-games to heaven's happiness; the terrible things of the world are
   but as a flea-biting to hell torments; and the pudder and business of
   the world but as a little childish sport in comparison of working out
   our salvation with fear and trembling. This Spirit helpeth us to
   overcome the world, and grow dead to the world, that we may be alive to
   God; to look for no great things here, but in the world to come. This
   Spirit is that which we should all labour after.

   4. From the covenant of Christ. It is one thing implied in the gospel
   covenant, when our Lord Jesus sets down the terms: Mat. xvi. 24, he
   saith, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up
   his cross and follow me;' that is, we must so believe in Christ, and be
   persuaded of the truth of his heavenly doctrine, that we are willing to
   deny our wit and will, natural interests and affections, and to lose
   all rather than lose our souls, or miss of the happiness he offereth
   us. Nay, taking up the cross is so considerable a part of our
   resignation to Christ and trust in him, that in Luke it is said, chap.
   ix. 23, let him take up his cross daily.' How daily? There are fair
   days as well as foul, and the face of heaven doth not always look sad
   and lowering. What is the meaning, then, of that, Let him take up his
   cross daily'? I answer first, it must be meant of daily expectation.
   The first day that we begin to think of being serious Christians we
   must reckon of the cross, we know not how soon it may come. If God
   seeth fit to spare you, yet you must be prepared for it; stand ready,
   as porters in the streets, to take up the burden which you must carry.
   Daily inure your thoughts to the cross, that the grievousness and
   bitterness of it may be somewhat allayed. St Paul saith, Acts xxi. 13,
   I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the
   name of the Lord Jesus;' and Eph. vi. 15, one great piece of the
   spiritual armour is, the preparation of the gospel of peace;' and 1
   Peter iii. 15, Be ready always to give an answer to every man that
   asketh a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear:' be
   ready in point of courage. Now this is necessary, because we are so apt
   to promise great things to ourselves, and indulge the security of the
   flesh by putting off the thoughts of the cross; but evils familiarised
   are the less burdensome, and by renewing our resolution daily, we are
   the more fortified. Secondly, to show the continuance of our conflicts,
   as if every day there were some new exercise for our faith and
   patience. We are not to prescribe to God how long he shall afflict us,
   nor with how much affliction he shall exercise us; no, though it were
   all the days of our lives, we must be content; it is but a moment to
   eternity. We must take up our cross till God remove it. Some promise
   fair to be contented with a naked Christ though they run all hazards,
   because they hope God will not take them at their words; but as soon as
   the cross cometh, wriggle, shift, and distinguish themselves out of
   their duty; or else, if it be long and frequently return, quite tire
   and are faint. So that Take it up daily,' is as much as Let patience
   have its perfect work,' James i. 4. If day after day we must be
   troubled, we must be content to be troubled. If God send it daily, we
   must take it up daily. Well, then, in the new covenant we undertook
   this; the new covenant doth comprise this as a clear branch and part of
   it. Christ telleth us the worst at first; the devil showeth us the bait
   but hideth the hook. The world useth to invite its followers with
   promises of honour and riches, but Christ telleth us of the cross, and
   that partly to discourage hypocrites, who cheapen and taste, but will
   not buy, and also to prepare sound believers for the nature and temper
   of his kingdom, which lieth in another world. But here by the way we
   are to undergo several trials, and therefore we should be armed with a
   mind to endure them, whether they come or no. God never intended Isaac
   should be sacrificed, but yet he will have Abraham tried.

   Use 1. Is information. With what thoughts we should take up the
   stricter profession of Christianity--namely, with expectations of the
   cross. Christ will try us, and the world will hate us; therefore let us
   not flatter ourselves with an easy passage to heaven. Many think they
   may be good Christians, yet live a life of pomp, and ease, and
   pleasure, free from all trouble and molestation. This is all one as if
   a soldier going to the wars should promise himself a continual peace or
   truce with the enemy, or as a mariner undertaking a long voyage should
   only think of fair weather and a calm sea, without waves and storms; so
   irrational is it for a Christian to look for nothing but rest and peace
   here upon earth. No; a Christian had need think of this to a double
   end, that he may be a mortified and a resolute man. If he be not
   mortified and dead to the world, he can never undergo the variety of
   conditions which his religion will expose him unto, and say with the
   apostle, Phil. iv. 13, 14, I can do all things through Christ which
   strengthened me; notwithstanding, ye have well done that ye did
   communicate with my affliction.' And there is usually in us a
   propensity and inclination either to honours, riches, or pleasures, and
   the devil will work upon that weakness, Heb. xii. 13. That which is
   lame is soon turned out of the way. If we have any weak part in our
   souls, there the assault will be most strong and fierce. A garrison
   that looketh to be besieged, will take care to fortify the weak places
   where there is any suspicion of an attack; so should a Christian
   mortify every corrupt inclination lest it betray him, be it love of
   honour, pleasure, or profit. He had need be also a well resolved man,
   well shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, or else in hard
   way he will soon founder and halt. If you be Christians indeed, you
   will soon see the necessity of it. Pure nature itself is against
   bearing the cross. Christ showed the innocent affections of human
   nature in his own person; it recoiled a little at the thought of the
   dreadful cup: Heb. v. 7, Who in the days of his flesh, when he had
   offered up prayers and supplication, with strong crying and tears, unto
   him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
   feared.' And to us it is much more grievous to suffer: Heb. xii. 11,
   Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous;
   nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.' But corrupt
   nature will certainly draw back, unless we be armed with great
   resolution; for after we have launched out into the deep with Christ,
   we shall be ready to run ashore again upon every storm, unless we be
   resolved; therefore you need to think of the cross to breed this
   resolution. If Christians be not mortified, they trip up their own
   heels; if they be not resolved and prepared for all weathers, they take
   up religion rather as a walk for recreation than as a journey or
   serious passage to heaven. Therefore we must all of us prepare for
   sufferings in this world, looking for no great matters here. We must
   expect persecutions, crosses, losses, wants, defamation, injuries; and
   we must get that furniture of heart and mind which may support and
   comfort us in such a day of trial.

   2. It informeth us what fools they are that take up religion upon a
   carnal design of ease and plenty, and will follow Christ to grow rich
   in the world; as this scribe thought to make a market of the gospel, as
   Simon Magus did, Acts viii. 19, 20; he thought to make a gain by the
   power of miracles. There are conveniences which religion affordeth in
   peaceable times, but the very profession at other times will engage us
   in great troubles; and therefore men do but make way for the shame of a
   change and other mischiefs, that hope for temporal commodities by the
   profession of the gospel. There are few that are willing to follow a
   naked Christ upon unseen encouragements, but this must be; for they
   that aim to seek the world in and by their religion are disclaimed by
   our Lord as unfit to be his servants, and indeed sorry servants they
   are who cannot live without honour, ease, and plenty; therefore turn
   and wind to shift the cross, put many a fallacy upon their own souls:
   Gal. vi. 12, As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, compel
   you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the
   cross of Christ.' If that be their only motive, they are apt to desert
   or pervert Christ's cause. Again, the apostle telleth us of some who
   are enemies to the cross of Christ, whose god is their belly, who mind
   earthly things,' Phil. iii. 18, 19. Men that have no love to God, but
   only serve their fleshly appetites, and look no higher than honours,
   riches, pleasures, and applause with men, will never be faithful to
   Christ. They are such as study to save themselves not from sin, tout
   from danger, and accordingly accommodate themselves to every interest.
   As the men of Keilah dealt with David,--entertained him for a while,
   but when Saul pursued him were resolved to betray him; they would come
   into no danger for David's sake. So they deal with Christ and religion.
   They profess Christ's name, but will surfer nothing for him. If they
   may enjoy him and his ways with peace, and quietness, and conveniency,
   and commodity to themselves, well and good; but if troubles arise for
   the gospel's sake, immediately they fall off; not only these
   summer-friends of the gospel, but the most, yea, the best, have a
   secret lothness and unwillingness to condescend to a condition of
   trouble or distress. This is a point of hard digestion, and most
   stomachs will not bear it.

   3. It informs us what an unlikely design they have in hand who would
   bring the world and Christ fairly to agree, or reconcile their worldly
   advantages and the profession of the gospel. And when they cannot frame
   the world and their conveniences to the gospel, do fashion the gospel
   to the world, and the carnal courses of it. It is pity these men had
   not been of the Lord's council when he first contrived and preached the
   gospel, that they might have helped him to some discreet and middle
   courses, that might have served turn for heaven and earth too. But do
   they what they will or can, the way is narrow that leadeth to life, and
   they must take Christ's yoke upon them if they would find rest for
   their souls. They will find that pure and strict religion will be
   unpleasing to the ungodly and the carnal; that the enmity between the
   two seeds will remain, and the flesh and the world must not always be
   pleased; that there is more danger of the world smiling than frowning.
   As to the church in general (in Constantine's time), Ecclesia facta est
   opibus major, virtutibus minor; so to believers in particular, that the
   heart is corrupted by the love of the world, and men never grow so dull
   and careless of their souls as when they have most of the world at
   will; and that we are more awakened, and have a more lively sense of
   eternal life, when under the cross, than when we live in the greatest
   ease and pomp; that Christ permitteth troubles, not for want of love to
   his people, or want of power to secure their peace, but for holy and
   wise ends to promote their good.

   Use 2. Is instruction. When you come to enter into covenant with
   Christ, consider--

   1. Christ knoweth what motives do induce you: John ii. 25, He needeth
   not that any should testify of man, for he knoweth what is in man.'
   Some believed, but Jesus committed not himself unto them; he knoweth
   whether there be a real bent or carnal bias upon the heart.

   2. If the heart be false in making the covenant, it will never hold
   good. An error in the first concoction will never be mended in the
   second: Deut. v. 29, Oh that there were such an heart in them, that
   they would fear me, and keep my commandments always, that it might be
   well with them, and with their children for ever.' So Matt. xiii. 21;
   The stony ground received the word with joy, Yet hath he not root in
   himself, but dureth but for a while; for when tribulation or
   persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.'
   Some temporal thing sitteth too near and close to the heart; you are
   never upright with God till a relation to God and a right to heaven do
   incomparably weigh down all temporal troubles, and you can rejoice more
   in the testimonies of God, fatherly love, and right to eternal life,
   than in outward things: Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many that say, Who will
   show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
   us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
   their corn and their wine increased.' David speaks in his own name, and
   in the name of all those that were alike minded with himself. And Luke
   x. 20, Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
   subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in
   heaven.'

   3. That Christ cannot but take it ill that we are so delicate and
   tender of our interests, and so impatient under the cross, when he
   endured so willingly such great things for our sakes. We cannot lose
   for him so much as he hath done for us; and if he had been unwilling to
   suffer for us, what had been our state and condition to all eternity?
   We should have suffered eternal misery. If you would not have Christ of
   another mind, why will you be of another mind? 1 Peter iv. 1, Forasmuch
   then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves
   likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh
   hath ceased from sin.'

   4. If you be not dead to the things of the world, you are not
   acquainted with the virtue and power of Christ's cross, and have not a
   true sense of Christianity, cannot glory in it as the most excellent
   profession in the world: Gal. vi. 14, God forbid that I should glory,
   save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
   crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' You are in a dangerous
   temptation to atheism.

   5. We are gainers by Christ if we part with all the world for his sake,
   Mark x. 29, 30; therefore no loss should seem too great in obeying his
   will. Certainly a man cannot be a loser by God.

   6. All worldly things were confiscated by the fall, and we can have no
   spiritual right to them till we receive a new grant by Jesus Christ,
   who is the heir of all things. Dominium politicum fundatur in
   providentia, evangelicum in gratia: 1 Cor. iii. 23, All things are
   yours, because you are Christ's, and Christ is God's;' and 1 Tim. iv.
   3, God hath made them to be received with thanksgiving of them which
   believe and know the truth.' So that what we enjoy is by the mere
   favour of the Redeemer, and should be parted with again when he calleth
   for it.

   Thus much for the first point.

   A second doctrine or point here offered is:--

   The great poverty of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Beasts and fowls have places to shelter themselves in, but Christ had
   no certain place of residence or dwelling wherein to rest. He doth not
   say kings have palaces, but I have none; rich men have houses and
   lands, but I have none. But he saith, Foxes have holes, and the birds
   of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
   head.'

   The reasons of this are these following:--

   1. To increase the value and merit of his satisfaction. Our sins did
   deserve this, his whole humiliation, and every degree of it; and Christ
   was content to suffer it for the ransom of our souls. It is clear this,
   that all his condescension conduced to make up the remedy more full;
   and it is evident by the apostle that it giveth us a right to a larger
   allowance of grace: 2 Cor. viii. 9, For ye know the grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he become
   poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.'

   2. Christ came to offer the kingdom of heaven, and the good things of
   the other world, and to draw men's minds and hearts thither. And,
   therefore, that he might appear a fit teacher of the world, by his own
   example, he taught us contempt of outward things. If he had preached up
   heavenly-mindedness, and lived himself in pomp and fulness, the people
   would not have regarded his words. Alexander, when his army grew
   sluggish, because laden with the spoils of their enemies; to free them
   from this incumbrance, commanded all his own carriages to be set on
   fire; that when they saw the king himself devote his rich treasures to
   the flame, they might not murmur if their mite and pittance were
   consumed also.' So if Christ had taught us contempt of the world, and
   had not given us an instance of it in his person, his doctrine had been
   less powerful and effectual.

   3. To season and sanctify a mean estate and degree of life, when we are
   called to it by God's providence. Christ's own poverty teacheth us to
   bear a mean condition well: Mat. x. 25, It is enough for a disciple
   that he be as his master, and a servant as his lord.' Uriah would not
   give way to any softness, while Joab his general was in the field: 2
   Sam. xi. 11, The ark and Israel are in tents, and my lord Joab and the
   servants of my lord are in the open fields; shall I go into my house
   and eat and drink?' &c. We must be contented to fare as Christ did; we
   cannot be poorer than Christ, as poor as we are; for the poorest have
   some place of shelter, but he had none whereon to lay his head.

   1. Let this, then, enforce the former lesson, and teach us contempt of
   the world, and the riches and greatness thereof. It is some argument
   that the vilest are capable thereof, as well as the most generous and
   best deserving, and oftener it happeneth to be so. But this is the
   argument of arguments,--That the Lord Jesus, when he came to instruct
   the world by his example, he was not one of the rich and voluptuous,
   but chose a mean estate, as most conducible to his ends.

   2. If you be rich, yet be poor in spirit: Mat. v. 3, Blessed are the
   poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' Let us possess
   all things as if we possessed them not, 1 Cor. vii. 31. And so James i.
   9, 10, Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted; but
   the rich, in that he is made low, because as the flower of the grass he
   shall pass away.' We should be as having nothing, sitting loose from
   earthly things, considering that shortly we shall be as poor as the
   poorest, for we can carry nothing away with us.

   3. Let us prepare ourselves to entertain poverty; and if it be already
   come upon us, and God hath reduced us to a mean inferior life, let us
   have our hearts reconciled and suited to a low estate, so it may be a
   help to heaven, so we may have the true riches, and may learn to live
   by faith, though God feedeth us from hand to mouth; so we may imitate
   Christ and follow him into glory, it is enough for us.

NO EXCUSE AGAINST A SPEEDY OBEYING CHRIST'S CALL.

   WE have done with the first instance, of a scribe that came uncalled;
   we come now to another. This man offereth not himself, but is called by
   Christ. And he said unto another, Follow me,' &c. He was already a
   disciple at large; for in Matthew it is said, chap. viii. 21, Another
   of his disciples said unto him, Suffer me first to go and bury my
   father.' He was now called to a nearer and constant attendance on
   Christ. Clemens Alexandrinus, from an ancient tradition, telleth us
   this was Philip. But before he complied with this call, he desireth a
   little delay and respite, until his aged father were dead and buried.
   Whether his father were already dead, and he would do this last office
   to see him decently interred, or whether his father were yet living,
   but not likely long to continue, and he would attend him till his death
   and funeral, and then follow Christ, as Theophilact thinketh, it is not
   much material. Clear it is he putteth off the matter with an excuse.
   Even the elect do not at first so readily obey the heavenly calling;
   some of them may put off Christ, but when he intendeth to have them,
   lie will not be put off so, the importunity of his grace overcoming
   their unwillingness.

   But what was Christ's answer? Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou
   and preach the kingdom of God;' that is, leave that office to others
   who are not designed for this divine and holy employment It seemeth
   hard to many that Christ should deny him to do this little office of
   love to his father, and they know not the meaning of that expression,
   Let the dead bury their dead.' Therefore--

   1. Let us open the expression.

   2. Show you what Christ teacheth us by this refusal.

   1. For the expression. It may be used either proverbially or
   allusively. Proverbially; let one dead man bury another--that is, let
   them lie unburied rather than my service be neglected; or, there will
   not want others that will remove the dead out of their sight: and it is
   our wisdom to let go things unnecessary, and mind the main. Or else it
   is used allusively to the law of the Nazarites and the priests of the
   Old Testament. The law of the Nazarites is in Num. vi. 6-8, All the
   days that he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall come at no dead
   body. He shall not make himself unclean for his father or his mother,
   for his brother or his sister, when they die: because the consecration
   of his God is upon his head. All the days of his separation he is holy
   unto the Lord;' that is, he must rather follow his vow in honouring the
   Lord, than to follow natural duty in honouring his dead parents. Now,
   those whom Christ called especially to follow him were consecrated to
   that service, as the Nazarite unto the Lord during the days of his
   separation. And as they might not meddle even with the interment of
   their parents, so this excuse was frivolous. Or else the allusion might
   be to the high priests, of whom we read, Deut. xxxiii. 9, Who said to
   his father and his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he
   acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children.' Some think this
   hath reference to the Levites' fact, who, being commanded by Moses,
   killed every man his brother, neighbour, friend, and son, that had
   sinned in making or worshipping the golden calf, Exod. xxxii. 26-29.
   Bather it is meant of the priest's continual duty, who, by the law, if
   his father, mother, brother, or child did die, he might not mourn for
   them, but carry himself as if he did not respect or know them; for God
   would have them more regard their function or duty in his service than
   any natural affection whatsoever. The law is, Lev. xxi. 11, 12, He
   shall not go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or
   his mother; neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
   sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is
   upon him.' Now Christ alludeth to the law to show the urgency of this
   present service and employment to which he was consecrated, and the
   burial of the dead might be left to persons less sacred or more at
   leisure.

   2. The reasons of Christ's refusal. Christ would show hereby--(1.) That
   all human offices and duties must give place to the duty we owe to God.
   Duty to parents must be observed, but duty to God must be preferred
   before that or anything whatsoever. A truth justified by Christ's own
   example. He began betimes, at twelve years old, when he was disputing
   with the doctors, and his parents sought for him: Luke ii. 49, He said
   unto them, How is it that you sought me? Wist you not that I must be
   about my Father's business?' So Mat. xii. 47, 48, when his mother and
   kindred waited for him, desiring to speak with him, He answered and
   said unto him that told him, Who is my mother, and who are my
   brethren?' Obedience to God, and declaring his Father's will, was
   dearer to him than all relations. Natural and secular respects swayed
   not with him in comparison of gaining proselytes to heaven; his
   mother's conference with him was nothing to his Father's service, and
   teaching the people a more acceptable work than paying a civility to
   his natural relations. So John ii. 4, Woman, what have I to do with
   thee? mine hour is not yet come.' His office to which he was sent by
   God was a matter in which she, though his earthly parent, was not to
   interpose; God's work must be done in God's own way, time, and method:
   God hath greater authority over you than all the men in the world. (2.)
   He would teach us hereby that the ministry requires the whole man, even
   sometimes the omission of necessary works, much more superfluous: Give
   thyself wholly to these things,' 1 Tim. iv. 15.

   The words are now explained; the practical notes are these two:--

   First, That nothing in the world is a matter of such great weight as to
   be a sufficient excuse for not following of Christ.

   Secondly, That those who are called to follow Christ should follow him
   speedily, without interposing any delays.

   For the first point, that nothing in the world is a matter of such
   great weight as to be a sufficient excuse for not following of Christ,
   I will illustrate it by these considerations:--

   1. There are two sorts of men. Some understand not their Lord's will,
   others have no mind to do it, Luke xii. 47, 48. Some understand not the
   terms of the gospel; they think to have Christ, and the pleasures of
   the flesh and the world too. But there are others who under stand
   Christ's terms, but are loth to become Christ's disciples; they know
   their master's will, but they do not prepare themselves to do it; that
   is, they do not presently set upon the work, but make so many delays
   that it plainly appeareth that they are loth to yield to Christ's
   terms; that is, to turn their backs upon the vanities of the world, and
   renounce their most pleasing sins, and to take the word for their rule,
   the Spirit for their guide, and eternal life for their felicity and
   happiness: to such we now speak.

   2. They that have no mind to follow Christ put off the matter with
   dilatory shifts and excuses. To refuse altogether is more heinous, and
   therefore they shift it off for a time. Non vacat is the pretence--I am
   not at leisure. Non placet, I like it not, is the real interpretation,
   disposition, and inclination of their hearts, for excuses are always a
   sign of an unwilling and backward heart. When they should serve God
   there is still something in the way, some danger, or some difficulty
   which they are loth to encounter with. As Prov. xxvi. 13, The slothful
   man saith, There is a lion in the way, there is a lion in the streets,'
   Palestine was a land infested with lions, because of the many deserts
   and thickets that were in it, but being well peopled, they did rarely
   appear. Now the sluggard taketh this pretence from thence. If his
   business lay in the fields, there was a lion in the way; if his
   business lay in the towns and cities, there is a lion in the streets,
   as sometimes, though but rarely, they came into places inhabited and of
   great resort. Now, if he should go about his business too early, he
   might meet with a lion in his range and walk before they were retired
   into their dens. Thus do men alarm themselves with their own foolish
   fears to excuse their idleness and negligence. So again Prov. xv. 19,
   The way of the slothful is as an hedge of thorns, but the way of the
   righteous is made plain.' They imagine difficulties and intolerable
   hardships in a course of godliness: but it is their cowardice and
   pusillanimous negligence which maketh the ways of God seem hard: they
   are all comfortable, plain, and easy to the pure and upright heart and
   willing mind. Come we to the New Testament: Luke xiv. 18-20, They all
   with one consent began to make excuse. The first said, I have bought me
   a piece of ground, and I must go to see it; I pray thee have me
   excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
   prove them; I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have
   married a wife, and cannot come.' The meaning is, many were invited to
   everlasting happiness, but they preferred their designs of worldly
   advantages. Mark, they do not absolutely deny, but make excuse. Excuses
   are the fruit of the quarrel between conviction and corruption. They
   are convinced of better things, but being prepossessed and biassed with
   worldly inclinations, they dare not fully yield nor flatly deny,
   therefore they choose a middle course, to make excuses. Doing is safe,
   or preparing ourselves to do, but excusing is but a patch upon a filthy
   sore, or a poor covering of fig-leaves for a naughty heart.

   3. The usual excuses which sinners may, and usually do allege, are
   these four:--The difficulty of religion, the danger that attendeth it,
   want of time, and that they have no power or strength to do good.

   [1.] For the first. It is troublesome and tedious to flesh and blood to
   be held to so much duty, and to wean our hearts from things we so
   dearly love; and the world thinketh that we are too nice and precise to
   urge men to such a strict and holy and heavenly life, and less ado will
   serve the turn.

   To this I answer:--

   (1.) Diligence is certainly necessary to all that will be saved: Phil,
   ii. 12, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;' 2 Peter
   iii. 14, Be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, with out
   spot and blameless.' And, therefore, if you cannot deny the ease and
   sloth of the flesh, you are wholly unfit for the work of godliness.

   (2.) This diligence is no more than needeth, whatever the carnal world
   thinketh, who leave the boat to the stream, and hope to be accepted
   with God for a few cold and drowsy devotions, or some superficial
   righteousness. A painter-stainer will think a painter-limner too
   curious, because his own work is but a little daubing. The broad way
   pleaseth the world best, but the narrow way leadeth to life.

   (3.) This diligence may be well afforded, considering that eternal life
   and death is in the case. Life! will you stop a journey for your lives
   because it is a little tedious, or there is dirt in the way, or the
   wind bloweth on you, and the like? Since it is for God and heaven, we
   should not grudge at a little labour: 1 Cor. xv. 58, Therefore be ye
   steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord;
   forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.'
   There is also death in the case. Now, which is better, to take a little
   profitable pains in godliness, or to endure everlasting torments? To
   save a little labour or diligence in the holy life, and run the hazard
   of being miserable for ever. Which is worst? The trouble of physic, or
   the danger of a mortal disease?

   [2.] Another excuse is the danger which attendeth it. It may expose you
   to great troubles to own God and religion heartily; and if there be
   peace abroad, and magistrates countenance religion, yet many times at
   home a man's greatest foes may be those of his own household, Mat. x.
   36. But for the pleasing or displeasing of your relations you must not
   neglect your duty to God; as Jerom to Heliodorus, per calcatum perge
   patrem--if thy father lie in the way, tread upon his bowels rather than
   not come unto Christ. Our Lord hath expressly told us, Mat. x. 37, He
   that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.'
   Neither favour nor disfavour of our friends is a just let or impediment
   to our duty. The advantages we can or are likely to receive from
   parents are not worthy to be compared with those we expect from God,
   nor is their authority over us so great as God's is: Luke xiv. 26, If
   any man come to me, and hate not his father or mother, and wife, and
   children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he
   cannot be my disciple.' Though Christianity doth not discharge us from
   obedience to parents, yet the higher duty must be preferred, namely,
   obedience to Christ, and loving less is hating.

   [3.] Another excuse is, I have no time to mind soul affairs. My
   distractions in the world are so great, and my course of life is such,
   that I have no leisure. I answer--Will you neglect God and salvation be
   cause you have worldly things to mind? Whatever your business be, you
   have a time to eat, and drink, and sleep; and have you no time to be
   saved? Better encroach upon other things than that religion should be
   cast to the walls or jostled out of your thoughts. David was a king,
   and he had more distracting cares than most of us have or can have, yet
   he saith, Ps. cxix. 147, 148, I prevented the dawning of the morning;
   and cried; I hoped in thy word. Mine eyes prevent the night-watches,
   that I may meditate in thy word;' and ver. 164, Seven times a day do I
   praise thee, because of thy righteous judgments.' Do you spend no time
   in idleness, vain talking, and carnal sports? and might not this be
   better employed about heavenly things? Eph. v. 15, 16, See then that ye
   walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time,
   because the days are evil.' Vitam non accepimus brevem, sed fecimus,
   nec inopes temporis, sed prodigi sumus. God hath not set you about work
   that he alloweth you no time for, but we waste our time, and then God
   is straitened. Many poorer than you have time, because they have a
   heart and will to improve it.

   [4.] I have no power or strength to do good. And what will you have us
   do? This is the excuse of the idle and naughty servant: Mat. xxv. 24, I
   knew that thou wert a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
   gathering where thou hast not strawed,' God sets you about work, but
   giveth you no strength, is your excuse; but certainly you can do more
   than you do, but you will not make trial. God may be more ready with
   the assistances of his grace than you can imagine. The tired man may
   complain of the length of the way, but not the lazy, who will not stir
   a foot. If you did make trial, you would not complain of God, but
   yourselves, and beg grace more feelingly. In short, you are not able,
   because you are not willing. And your impotency is increased by evil
   habits contracted, and long custom in sin.

   I now proceed to the fourth consideration.

   4. None of these excuses are sufficient for not following of Christ.
   And that--

   [1.] Because of his authority. Who requireth this duty from us, or
   imposeth it on us? It is the Lord Jesus Christ, to whose sentence we
   must stand or fall. When he biddeth us follow him, and follow him
   speedily, to excuse ourselves is to countermand and contradict his
   authority: it is flat disobedience, though we do not deny the duty, but
   only shift off and excuse our present compliance; for he is as
   peremptory for the time and season as for the duty. Now while it is
   called to-day, harden not your hearts,' Heb. iii. 7, 8. God standeth
   upon his authority, and will have a present answer. If he say, To-day,
   it is flat disobedience for us to say, To-morrow; or Suffer me first to
   do this and that business.

   [2.] It appeareth from his charge to his messengers. Nothing can take
   off a minister of the gospel from seeking the conversion and salvation
   of souls. We cannot plead anything to exempt us from this work. To
   plead that the people's hearts are hard, and that the work is difficult
   and full of danger, will not serve the turn. No; Their blood will I
   require at thy hands.' Therefore, all excuses set aside, we must
   address ourselves to our work. Acts xx. 23, 24: Paul went bound in the
   spirit, and the Holy Ghost had told him that in every city bonds and
   afflictions did abide and wait for him; but, saith he, None of these
   things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so as I may
   finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of my
   Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.' He was willing
   and ready to endure what should befall him at Jerusalem, and reckoned
   nothing of it, nor of loss of life, if he might successfully preach the
   gospel, and serve Christ faithfully in the office of the ministry. If
   nothing be an excuse to us, can anything be an excuse to you? Should
   your souls be nearer and dearer to us than to yourselves?

   [3.] It appeareth from the matter of the duty imposed on you, if you
   consider the excellency and the necessity of it.

   To begin first: The excellency. All excuses against obedience to God's
   call are drawn from the world and the things that are in the world. Now
   there is no comparison between the things of the world and following
   Christ's counsel, that we may be everlastingly happy. The question will
   soon be reduced to this, Which is most to be regarded, God or the
   creature, the body or the soul, eternity or time? The excuses are for
   the body, for time, for the creature; but the in junctions of duty are
   for God, for the soul, and for eternity. Sense saith, Favour the flesh:
   faith saith, Save thy soul; the one is of everlasting consequence, and
   conduceth to a happiness that hath no end; the other only for a time: 2
   Cor. iv. 18, While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
   things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal,
   but the things which are not seen are eternal.' One turn of the hand of
   God separateth the neglected soul from the pampered body, and then
   whose are all these things?

   The necessity: that we may please God and enjoy him for ever. We can
   never plead for a necessity of sinning; for a man is never driven to
   those straits, whether he shall sin more or less; but some times duties
   come in competition--duty to a father, and a special in junction of
   Christ's to follow him; one must be subordinated to the other, and the
   most necessary must take place; the less give place to the greater.
   Now, this is much more true of those things which are usually pleaded
   by way of hesitancy, or as a bar to our duty, as our worldly and carnal
   satisfactions. But you will say, we must avoid poverty and shame. But
   it is more necessary to avoid damnation; not to preserve our temporal
   interests, but to seek after eternal life: Luke x. 42, One thing is
   necessary.'

   [4.] It appeareth from the nature of the work. To follow Christ is not
   to give to him as much as the flesh can spare, but wholly to devote
   yourselves to his service, to sell all for the pearl of great price,
   Mat. xiii. 46. And you are obliged to walk so, that all may give way to
   the glory of God, and the service of your redeemer. If He will employ
   us thus and thus, we must not contradict it, or plead anything by way
   of excuse.

   Use. Do not neglect your duty for vain excuses. The excusing humour is
   very rife and very prejudicial to us, for the sluggard hath a high
   conceit of his own allegations: Prov. xxvi. 16, The sluggard is wiser
   in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.' In the
   Eastern countries their council usually consisted of seven, as we read
   of the seven princes of Media and Persia, Esther i. 14. Therefore let
   us a little disprove this vain conceit. The sluggard thinketh himself
   so wise that all others are but giddy and crazy-brained people, that
   are too nice and scrupulous, and make more ado with religion than
   needeth. But can a man do too much for God and heaven? 1 Thes. ii. 12.
   The sluggard thinketh it is a venture, and he may venture on one side
   as well as the other; but it is a thousand to one against him in the
   eye of reason, put aside faith: in doubtful cases, the surest way is to
   be taken. But to draw it to a more certain determination.

   1. Nothing is a reasonable excuse which God's word disproveth, for the
   scriptures were penned to discover the vain sophisms which are in the
   hearts of men: Heb. iv. 12, For the word of God is quick and powerful,
   and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing
   asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
   discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;' to discover the
   affections of a sensual heart, however palliated with the pretences of
   a crafty understanding. Certainly, our private conceits must not be
   lifted up against the wisdom of God, nor can a creature be justified in
   going against his maker's will. Nothing can be reason which the God of
   wisdom contradicts and calleth folly: Jer. viii. 9, Lo, they have
   rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?'

   2. Nothing can be pleaded as a reasonable excuse which your consciences
   are not satisfied is reason. Men consult with their affections rather
   than with their consciences. Conscience would draw other conclusions,
   therefore our excuses are usually our aggravations: Luke xix. 22, Out
   of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant.' The master
   expected increase, therefore he should have done what he could: Job xv.
   6, Thine own mouth condemneth thee; yea, thine own lips testify against
   thee.' That is the strongest conviction which ariseth from a man's own
   bosom; that is the reason why there are so many appeals to conscience
   in scripture: 1 Cor. x. 15, I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I
   say.' Your own hearts tell you ye ought to be better, to mind God more,
   and the world less, to be more serious in preparing for your eternal
   estate.

   3. Nothing can be a reasonable excuse which reflects upon God, as if he
   had made a hard law which none can keep, especially if urged against
   the law of grace; this is to say, the ways of God are not equal,
   therefore there can be no excuse for the total omission of necessary
   duties.

   4. No excuse can be reasonable, but what you dare plead at the bar of
   Christ; for that is reason which will go for reason at last. Then the
   weight of all pleas will be considered, and all negligent persons that
   have not improved the light of nature, or have not obeyed the gospel,
   will be left without excuse. What doth it avail prisoners to set up a
   mock sessions among themselves to acquit one and condemn another? He is
   in a good condition that shall be excused in the last judgment, and in
   a bad condition that shall be condemned then.

   1 now proceed to the second point.

   Secondly, That those who are called to follow Christ, should follow him
   speedily, without interposing any delays.

   Consider--

   1. Ready obedience is a good evidence of a sound impression of grace
   left upon our hearts. There is a slighter conviction which breedeth a
   sense of our duty, but doth not so strongly urge us to the performance
   of it. And there is a more sound conviction, which is accompanied with
   a prevailing efficacy, and then all excuses and delays are laid aside,
   and men kindly comply with God's call: Cant. i. 4, Draw me, I will run
   after thee.' Run; it noteth an earnest and speedy motion; the fruit of
   the powerful attraction of the Spirit: Mat. iv. 20, They straightway
   left their nets and followed him.' The scoffing atheistical world
   thinketh it easiness and fond credulity, but it argueth a sound
   impression. The impulsions of the Holy Spirit work in an instant, for
   they carry their own evidence with them: Gal. i. 16, Immediately I
   consulted not with flesh and blood.' In divinis, non est deliberandum.
   When our call is clear, there needeth no debate or demurring upon the
   matter.

   2. The work goeth on the more kindly when we speedily obey the
   sanctifying motions of the Spirit, and the present influence and
   impulsion of his grace. You have not such an advantage of a warm
   conviction afterward: when the waters are stirred then we must put in
   for a cure, John v. 4. To adjourn and put it off, as Felix did, Acts
   xxiv. 25, doth damp and cool the work--you quench this holy fire; or to
   stand hucking with God, as Pharaoh did, the work dieth on your hand.

   3. There is hazard in delaying and putting off such a business of
   concernment as conversion to God. Certainly this is a business of the
   greatest concernment, and the greatest work should be first thought of:
   Mat. vi. 33, Seek first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness
   thereof;' and most thought of:' Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired
   of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of
   the Lord.' Now, if we delay, it is left upon great hazards. Life is
   uncertain, for you know not what a day may bring forth: Prov. xxvii. 1,
   Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
   bring forth.' If God had given leave (as princes sometimes in a
   proclamation, for all to come in within a certain day); so if God had
   said, Whosoever doth not repent till thirty or forty years be out,
   there were no great hazard till the time were expired, we might
   entertain sin a little while longer. But we know not the day of our
   death, therefore we should get God to bless us ere we die. A new call
   is uncertain, 2 Cor. vi. 1, 2. It may be he will treat with us no more
   in such a warm and affectionate manner. If he call, yet not vouchsafe
   such assistances of his grace, if, peradventure, God will give them
   repentance unto life,' 2 Tim. ii. 25. It is a hazard or uncertain if
   the Spirit of God will put another thought of turning into your hearts,
   when former grace is despised: Isa. lv. 6, Call upon the Lord while he
   is near, and seek him while he may be found.'

   4. Consider the mischiefs of delaying. Every day we contract a greater
   indisposition of embracing God's call. We complain now it is hard; if
   it be hard to-day, it will be harder to-morrow, when God is more
   provoked, and sin more strengthened, Jer. xiii. 23. Yea, it may be, our
   natural faculties are decayed, the vigour of our youth exhausted. When
   the tackling is spoiled and the ship rotten, it is an ill time to put
   to sea: Eccles. xii. 1, Remember now thy creator in the days of thy
   youth.' And besides, consider the suspicion that is upon a late
   repentance. The most profane would have God for their portion at last.

   5. The reasons for delay are inconsiderable. Suppose it be our
   satisfaction in our present estate. The pleasures of sin are sweet, and
   we are loth to forego them; but those pleasures must one day be
   renounced, or you are for ever miserable. Why not now? Sin will be as
   sweet to the carnal appetite hereafter as now it is; and salvation is
   dispensed upon the same terms. You cannot be saved hereafter with less
   ado, or bring down Christ and heaven to a lower rate. If this be a
   reason now, it will for ever lie as a reason against Christ, and
   against conversion. The laws of Christianity are unalterable, always
   the same, and your hearts not like to be better. Or is it that you are
   willing now, but you have no leisure? when such encumbrances are over,
   you shall get your hearts into better posture. Oh no; it is hypocrisy
   to think you are willing when you delay. Nothing now hindereth but a
   want of will; and when God treateth with thee about thine eternal
   peace, it is the best time; but God always cometh to the sinner
   unseasonably in his own account. But consider, it was the devil that
   said, Mat. viii. 29, Art thou come hither to torment us before the
   time?'

   The use is, to reprove that dallying with God in the work of
   conversion, which is so common and so natural to us.

   The causes of it are:--

   1. Unbelief, or want of a due sense and sight of things to come. If men
   were persuaded of eternal life and eternal death, they would not stand
   hovering between heaven and hell, but presently engage their hearts to
   draw nigh to God. But we cannot see afar off: 2 Peter i. 9, He that
   lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off.'

   2. Another cause is security. They do not take these things into their
   serious thoughts. Faith showeth it is sure, and consideration bringeth
   it near: Amos vi. 3, Ye put far away the evil day.' Things at a
   distance do not move us. We should pray, and preach, and practise as if
   death were at our backs, and remember that all our security dependeth
   upon the slender thread of a frail life.

   3. Another cause is averseness of heart; they have no mind to these
   things: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God.' The heart
   is inclined to worldly vanities, set against God and godliness. Now let
   us consider the heinousness of this sin. It is ingratitude and
   unthankfulness for God's eternal love: Ps. ciii. 17, The mercy of the
   Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.' It is
   also disingenuity; we would be heard presently: Ps. cii. 2, Lord, hear
   me speedily.' To-day is the season of mercy, to-morrow of duty. We are
   always in haste, would have the Lord to tarry for our sinful leisure,
   when we will not tarry his holy leisure. It is also base self-love; we
   can be content to dishonour God longer, provided at length we may be
   saved. Lastly, it is great injustice to keep God out of his right; he
   hath been long enough kept out of his right already: 1 Peter iv. 3, The
   time past of our life may suffice to have wrought the will of the
   Gentiles.' Therefore, let us no longer delay, but speedily address
   ourselves to entertain the motions of the Holy Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

LOOKING BACK ILL BECOMES THOSE THAT HAVE SET THEIR FACE HEAVENWARD.

   WE are now come to the third instance, wherein we are instructed how to
   avoid miscarriages in following Christ.

   The first instance teaches us to beware of hasty and hypocritical
   profession, which is the fruit of resolution without deliberation, or
   sitting down and counting the charges; this was the fault of the
   scribe.

   The second instance cautioneth us against dilatory shifts and excuses.
   The most necessary business must not be put off upon any pretence
   whatsoever.

   The third instance forbiddeth all thoughts of compounding, or hopes to
   have Christ and the world too; as this man hoped first to secure his
   worldly interest, and then to follow Christ at .leisure. Whether this
   man were called, or uncalled, it appeareth not. It is only said in the
   text, Another also said:' the middle person was only called by Christ;
   the other two offered themselves. The first was forward, upon a
   mistaken ground, to share the honours of the kingdom of the Messiah,
   which he supposed to be temporal. This last offereth himself, but his
   heart was not sufficiently loosened from the world. From both we see
   that it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but God
   that showeth mercy,' Rom. ix. 16; for neither of those that offered
   themselves are accepted.

   In the words you may observe:--

   1. His request.

   2. Christ's answer.

   1. His request. This third offereth himself to be a disciple of Christ,
   but with an exception--that he might take his farewell at home, and
   dispose of his estate there, and so secure his worldly interests: I
   will follow thee, but let me bid those farewell which are at home in my
   house.' You will say, What harm in this request? Elijah granted it to
   Elisha, 1 Kings xix. 21. When he had laid his mantle on him, thereby
   investing him in the office of a prophet, Elisha said, Let me, I pray
   thee, go and kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow
   thee:' which the prophet granteth, and gave way to Elisha to go home
   and salute his friends.

   I answer--

   [1.] The evangelical ministry exceedeth the prophetical, both as to
   excellency and necessity, and must be gone about speedily without any
   delay. The harvest was great, and such an extraordinary work was not to
   be delayed nor interrupted.

   [2.] If two men do the same thing, it followeth not that they do it
   with the same mind. Things may be the same as to the substance or
   matter of the action, yet circumstances may be different. Christ knew
   this man's heart, and could interpret the meaning of his desire to go
   home first. He might make it a pretence to depart clean away from
   Christ. We cannot distinguish between the look of Abraham and the look
   of Lot. One is allowed, the other forbidden. Abraham is allowed to look
   towards Sodom: Gen. xix. 28, And Abraham got up early in the morning,
   and looked towards Sodom, and behold the smoke of the country went up
   as the smoke of a furnace.' Yet Lot and his family are forbidden to
   look that way: Gen. xix. 17, Look not behind thee.' We cannot
   distinguish between the laughter of Abraham and the laughter of Sarah:
   Gen. xvii. 17, And Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in
   his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old?
   and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?' Now compare Gen.
   xviii. 12; it is said, And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After
   I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old?' Yet she
   is reproved, For the Lord said, Wherefore did Sarah laugh?' The one was
   joy and reverence, the other unbelief and contempt. We cannot
   distinguish between the Virgin Mary's question, Luke i. 34, How can
   this be?' and the question of Zachary, John's father, Luke i. 18, How
   shall I know this, for I am an old man?' Mary was not reproved, but he
   was struck dumb for that speech. But though we cannot distinguish, God,
   that knoweth the secrets of all hearts, can distinguish.

   [3.] Those that followed Christ on these extraordinary calls were to
   leave all things they had, without any further care about them: Mat.
   xix. 21, Sell all that thou hast, and follow me, and thou shalt have
   treasure in heaven.' So Mat. iv. 19, 20, He saith unto them, Follow me,
   and I will make you fishers of men: and they straightway left their
   nets and followed him.' So Mat. ix. 9, As Jesus passed forth from
   thence, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom:
   and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.'
   Therefore it was preposterous for this man to desire to go home to
   order and dispose of his estate and family, before he complied with his
   call.

   [4.] In resolution, estimation, and vow, the same is required of all
   Christians, when Christ's work calleth for it: Luke xiv. 33, So
   likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath,
   he cannot be nay disciple.'

   2. Christ's answer, which consists of a similitude, and its
   interpretation joined together.

   [1.] The metaphor or similitude. Taken from ploughmen, who cannot make
   straight furrows if they look back. So, to look back, after we have
   undertaken Christ's yoke and service, rendereth us unfit for the
   kingdom of God. Putting our hands to the plough is to undertake
   Christ's work, or to resolve to be his disciples. Looking back, noteth
   an hankering of mind after the world, and also a return to the worldly
   life. For, first, we look back, and then we go back. First, we have an
   overvaluing of the world, and then we return to the worldly life.

   Doct. That looking back will not become those who have set their faces
   heavenward.

   We have an instance in the text of a man which pretended to follow
   Christ, which is to set our faces heavenward (for we follow Christ,
   first in labour and patience, and then into glory). But he would look
   back, and had many thoughts of what he had left at home. And he is
   pronounced unfit for the kingdom of God, that is, to be a disciple of
   Christ. And we have another instance, recommended to our observation by
   our Lord himself: Luke xvii. 32, Remember Lot's wife;' that is,
   remember her sin, and remember her punishment. Both are taken notice
   of, Gen. xix. 26, But his wife looked back from behind him, and she
   became a pillar of salt.' There was a hankering of mind after what she
   had left in Sodom. She looked back, because she had left her heart
   behind her; there were her kindred, her friends, and her country, and
   pleasant place of abode. That look was a kind of repenting that she had
   come out of Sodom, And what was her punishment? She that looked back
   perished as well as they that never came out. Yea, she is set up as a
   monument or spectacle of public shame and dishonour, to warn the rest
   of the world to obey God, and trust themselves with his providence.

   In handling this point I shall show you:--

   1. Upon what occasions we may be said to look back.

   2. How ill this becomes those that have put their hands to the plough.

   1. Upon what occasions we may be said to look back. A double pair I
   shall mention.

   The first sort of those:--

   [1.] That pretend to follow Christ, and yet their hearts hanker after
   the world, the cares, pleasures, and vain pomp thereof. Certainly all
   that would follow Christ must renounce their worldly affections and
   inclinations, or else they can make no work of Christianity. I prove it
   from the nature of conversion, which is a turning from the creature to
   God, from self to Christ, and from sin to holiness. The first is proper
   to our case. As our degeneration was a falling from God to the
   creature, Jer. ii. 13, so our regeneration is a turning from the
   creature to God. If we leave the world unwillingly, our dedication will
   soon come to nothing, for then our hearts are false with God in the
   very making of the covenant. If we engaged ourselves to God before the
   fleshly mind and interest were never well conquered, as we were not
   well loosened from the world, so not firmly engaged to God, and
   therefore, when our interest requires it, we shall soon forsake God.

   [2.] When men are discouraged in his service by troubles and
   difficulties, and so, after a forward profession, all cometh to
   nothing: Heb. x. 38, If any man draw back, my soul shall have no
   pleasure in him.' The former is looking back, and this is drawing back.
   The one ariseth out of the other: all their former zeal and courage is
   lost, they are affrighted and driven out of their profession r and
   relapse into the errors they have escaped. This is the first pair. Once
   more, the other pair is this:--

   There is a looking back with respect to mortification, and a looking
   back with respect to vivification.

   (1.) With respect to mortification , which is the first part of
   conversion. So we must not look back, or mind anything behind us, which
   may turn us back, and stop us in our course. The world and the flesh
   are the things behind us; we turned our back upon them in conversion,
   when we turned to God. Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly
   lusts.' Titus ii. 12. It is the world that doth call back our thoughts,
   and corrupt our affections--the world, that is an enemy to God, and our
   religion, James iv. 4. Therefore, the world must be renounced, and we
   must grow dead to the world, that we may be alive to God. There is no
   halting between both.

   (2.) With respect to vivification, or progress in the duties of the
   holy and heavenly life. So the apostle telleth us, Phil. iii. 13, But
   this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
   reaching forth unto those things which are before,' &c. Farther
   progress in holiness is the one thing that we should mind, and that
   above all other things. This is the unum necessarium, Luke x. 42; the
   primum or principium, the one thing, that is, the main thing: Ps.
   xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
   after.' But how should we mind it? Not looking to the things which are
   behind, but looking to the things which are before. The things behind
   are our imperfect beginnings, or so much of the race as we have over
   come and got through. It is the sluggard's trick to consider how much
   of the journey is past, or how far the rest of the racers are behind
   him. But he that sets heartily to his business considers how much is
   before, that he may get through the remainder of his race, and so
   obtain the prize. The things which are before us are God and heaven,
   and the remaining duties of the holy life. These we should mind, and
   not look back, as satisfying ourselves with what we have attained to
   already.

   2. How ill it becometh those that have put their hands to the spiritual
   plough.

   [1.] In respect of the covenant into which they enter, or the manner of
   entrance into it, which is by a fixed unbounded resignation of
   themselves unto God. Till this be done, we are but half Christians. As
   suppose we desire privileges, would have God to be our God, but neglect
   duties, and are loth to become his people; or suppose we see a
   necessity of that, and so are in some measure willing to give up
   ourselves to him, yet if our resolution be not fixed, or be not
   unbounded, without reserves, and against all reserves, the covenant is
   not condescended unto. We do nothing unless we do that which is further
   required of us.

   (1.) If it be not fixed, but wavering, we do but treat; we do not
   conclude, and come to a full agreement with God: Acts xi. 23, He
   exhorted them all, that, with full purpose of heart, they would cleave
   unto the Lord.' It implieth such a resolution as carrieth the force of
   a principle. Agrippa was almost a Christian, had some enamouring and
   uncertain inclinations: Acts xxvi. 28, Almost thou persuadest me to be
   a Christian.' Christ is resolved to stick to his servants, and
   therefore he expects that they should be resolved to stick to him.

   (2.) If it be not unbounded, reserving nothing, but leaving all to
   Christ, to be disposed of at his will. Except but one thing, and the
   covenant is not fully concluded; it sticketh at that article; it is but
   hucking with God, not agreeing with God. Resolving with reserves is no
   resolution at all. It is but dealing like Ananias and Sapphire, giving
   something, and keeping back the rest, Acts v. Christ will have no
   disciples which will not part with all. Nothing must be reserved,
   neither credit, nor life, nor estate, Luke xiv. 28. Now, none of this
   can be as long as you look back, or allow that that will tempt you to
   look back; that is, till you be thoroughly loosened from the world; for
   whilst the heart cleaveth to any earthly thing, your resolution is
   unfixed. They that only take Christ upon liking, will soon be tempted
   to mislike him and his ways; and your resolution is not unbounded,
   whilst you set upon the profession of religion, and yet keep the,
   world, or something of the world: your heart will ever and anon be
   seeking occasions to withdraw; for you were false at heart at your
   first setting out, and treacherous in the very making of your covenant.

   [2.] With respect to the duties of Christianity, or that part of the
   kingdom of God which concerneth your obedience to him, you are never
   fit for these while the heart cleaveth to earthly things, and you are
   still hankering after the world.

   A threefold defect there will be in our duties:--

   (1.) They will be unpleasant.

   (2.) They will be inconstant

   (3.) Imperfect in such a degree as to want sincerity.

   (1.) Your duty will be unpleasant to you, so far as you are worldly and
   carnal, so that you can never yield cheerful and ready obedience to
   God. Certain it is that we must serve God, and serve him with delight.
   His commandments should be kept, and they should not be grievous to us,
   1 John v. 3. Now, what is the great impediment? Worldly lusts are not
   thoroughly purged out of the heart; for presently he addeth this
   reason, For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.' It is a
   hard heart maketh our work hard; and the heart is hard and
   unpersuadable when our affections are engaged elsewhere. The readiness
   of our obedience dependeth on the fervency of our love; the fervency of
   our love on our victory over the world; our victory over the world on
   the strength of our faith; the strength of our faith on the certainty
   we have of the principal object of our faith; the principal object of
   our faith is, that Jesus is the Son of God, whose counsel we must take,
   if we will be happy. And the evidence of that principle is the double
   testimony or attestation given to him from heaven, or in the heart of a
   believer. Once settle in that, that you can entirely trust yourselves
   and all your interests in the hands of Christ, and all duties will be
   easy.

   (2.) You will be inconstant in it, and apt to be ensnared again, when
   you meet with occasions and temptations that suit with your heart's
   lusts. As the Israelites were drawn out of Egypt against their wills,
   the flesh-pots of Egypt were still in their minds, and, therefore, were
   ready to make themselves a captain and return again, Num. xiv. 4; and
   James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable in his ways.' Nothing will
   hold an unwilling heart. Demas had not quitted this hankering mind
   after the world, and therefore it prevented him doing his duty: 2 Tim.
   iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.' He
   left the work of the gospel to mind his own private affairs. The love
   of riches, pleasure, ease, and safety, if they be not thoroughly
   renounced, will tempt us to a like revolt and neglect of God.
   Therefore, to prevent it, when we first put our hands to the plough, we
   must resolve to renounce the world: Ps. xlv. 10, Forget also thine own
   people, and thy father's house.' Look back no more. As long as we are
   entangled in our lusts and enticements of the world, we are unmeet to
   serve God. Paul counted those things that were gain to him to be loss
   for Christ: Phil. iii. 7, 8, Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but
   loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
   whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but dung,
   that I may win Christ.' Paul repented not of his choice, but showeth
   his perseverance in the contempt of the world,--I have counted, and do
   count. He seeth no cause to recede from his choice. Many affect
   novelties, are transported at their first change, but repent at
   leisure.

   (3.) We are imperfect in it; I mean, to such a degree as to want
   sincerity, for they bring nothing to perfection, Luke viii. 14. Their
   fruit never groweth ripe or sound, for religion is an underling. Some
   good inclinations they have to heavenly things, but their worldly
   affections are greater, and overtop them so, that though they do not
   plainly revolt from their profession, yet their duties want that life
   and power which is necessary, so that they bring little honour to
   Christ by being Christians.

   [3.] In respect of the hurt that cometh from their looking back, both
   to themselves and to religion.

   (1.) To themselves: 2 Peter ii. 20, 21, For if after they have escaped
   the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, their latter
   end is worse with them than their beginning. For it had been better for
   them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have
   known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.' Many
   have so much of the knowledge of Christ as to cleanse their external
   conversation; but sin and the world were never so effectually cast out
   but they are in secret league with them still; and, therefore, they are
   first entangled, and then overcome; first enticed by some pleasure or
   profit, and then carried away with the temptation. But what cometh of
   this? Their latter end is worse than their beginning.' Their sin is
   greater, since they sin against light and taste; their judgment is
   greater, both spiritual and eternal; as God giveth them over to brutish
   lusts, and to the power of Satan. And this will be a cutting thought to
   them to all eternity, to remember how they lost their acquaintance
   with, and benefit by, Christ, by looking back to the world, and
   deserting that good way wherein they found so much sweetness in Christ.

   (2.) The mischief which is done to religion. They wonderfully dishonour
   God, and bring contempt upon the ways of godliness, when, after they
   have made trial of it, they prefer sin before it, as if God had wearied
   them, Micah vi. 3. Therefore it is just with God to vindicate his
   honour. And Satan, after he seemeth to be for a while rejected, taketh
   a more durable possession of them, Luke xi. 26. Oh, think of this
   often!--to look back after we seemed to escape doth involve us in the
   greater sin and misery. Better never to have yielded to God so far,
   than to retract at last, partly because their sins are sins against
   knowledge: Luke xii. 47, That servant which knew his Lord's will, and
   prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be
   beaten with many stripes,' Partly because they are unthankful for so
   much deliverance, by the knowledge of Christ, as they received, and
   that is an heinous aggravation of their offence. Partly because their
   sin is treachery and breach of vows, for they turned the back upon the
   world and all the allurements thereof, when they consented to the
   covenant, and resolved to follow Christ in all conditions, till he
   should bring them into a place of rest and safety. Partly because they
   sin against experience, after they have had some relish and taste of
   better things, Heb. vi. 4. Partly because their conversion again is the
   more difficult, the devil having a greater hold of them, Mat. xii. 44.

   [4.] With respect to the disproportion that is between the things that
   tempt us to look back, and those things that are set before us.

   (1.) The things that tempt us to look back are the pleasures of sin and
   the profits of the world. Both are but a temporary enjoyment: Heb. xi.
   25, The pleasures of sin, which are but for a season.' The pleasures of
   sin are base and brutish, which captivate and bring a slavery on the
   soul, Titus iii. 3. The enjoyments of the world cannot last long; your
   gust and relish of them, within a little while will be gone, 1 John ii.
   17; yet these are the things that tempt you to forget and draw you off
   from God. And will you marry your souls again to those sins from which
   they were once divorced, and for such paltry vanities repent of your
   obedience to God, even after you have made trial of him? Are these
   things grown better, or God grown worse, that you should turn your
   hearts from him to them?

   (2.) The things that are before you are God and heaven; reconciliation
   with God, and the everlasting fruition of him in glory.

   Reconciliation with God, with the consequent benefits; communion with
   God now, peace of conscience, the gift of the Spirit, and the hopes of
   glory. If there were no more than these, shall we look back? Can we
   find better things in the world? Alas! there is nothing here but fears
   and snares, a vexatious uncertainty, and polluting enjoyments, such as
   may easily make us worse, but cannot make us better. What is this but
   to forsake the cold flowing waters for a dirty puddle? Jer. xviii. 14,
   our own mercies for lying vanities, Jonah ii. 8.

   The everlasting fruition of him in glory. Shall we look back that are
   striving for a crown of endless glory, as if we were weary of the
   pursuit, and give it over as a hopeless or fruitless business? If
   Christ will lead us to this glory, let us follow him, and go on in what
   is well begun without looking back. Never let us leave a crown of glory
   for a crown of thorns.

   Use. Is for instruction, to teach us what to do if we would set about
   the strict practice of religion.

   1. See that your worldly love be well mortified, for till you be dead
   to the world God cannot recover his interest in your souls, nor the
   divine nature be set up there with any life and power, 2 Peter i. 4;
   see also 1 John ii. 15, and 1 John v. 4. Till this be done, God and
   glory cannot be your ultimate end, nor the main design of your life;
   for the world will turn your hearts another way, and will have the
   principal ruling and disposing of your lives: the world will have that
   love, trust, care, and service that belongeth to God, and be a great
   hindrance to you in the way to heaven, and you will never have peace.
   The world doth first delude you, and then disquiet you, and if you
   cleave to it as your portion, you must look for no more. Well, then,
   mortified it must be; for how can you renounce the world as an enemy if
   your hearts be not weaned from it so far that it is a more indifferent
   thing to you to have it or want it, and that you be not so eager for
   it, or so careful about it?

   2. Let not the world steal into your hearts again, nor seem so sweet to
   you, for then you are under a temptation. It is our remaining folly and
   backsliding nature that is ever looking to the world which we have
   forsaken. Now, when you find this, whenever the world hath insinuated
   into your affections, and chilled and cooled them to God and heaven,
   see that the distemper be presently expelled. Pray, as David, Ps. cxix.
   36, Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not unto covetousness.'
   Be sure to be more fruitful in good works: Luke xi. 41, Give alms of
   such things as you have, and behold all things are clean unto you.' We
   renounced the world in our baptismal vow, we overcame the world in our
   whole after course. It is not so got out of any but that we still need
   an holy jealousy and watchfulness over ourselves. Now, that we may do
   both of these, I shall give you some directions.

   [1.] Fix your end and scope, which is to be everlastingly happy in the
   enjoyment of God. The more you do so, the less in danger you will be of
   looking back. We are often pressed to lay up treasures in heaven, Mat.
   vi. 20; and, as those that are risen with Christ,' to seek the things
   which are above,' Col. iii. 1. Our Lord himself saith to the young man,
   Mark x. 21, Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
   shalt have treasures in heaven.' If your life and business be for
   heaven, and your mind be kept intent on the greater matters of
   everlasting life, nothing will divert you therefrom; you will almost be
   ready to forget earth, because you have higher and better things to
   mind. It is not barely thinking of the troubles of the world, or
   confessing its vanities, will cure your distempers, but the true sight
   of a better happiness. A little in hand is better, you will think, than
   uncertain hopes; but a sound belief, which is the substance of things
   hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,' that openeth heaven to
   you, and will soon make you of another mind.

   [2.] Entirely trust yourself, and all your concernments, in the hand of
   God. Christ expected from all those whom he called in an extraordinary
   manner, that they should leave all without any thought or solicitude
   about it, trusting in him not only for their eternal reward, but for
   their provision and protection by the way during their service. And the
   same in effect is required of all Christians; not to leave our estates
   or neglect our calling, but renouncing the world, and resolving to take
   such a lot in good part as he shall carve out to them. All that enter
   into covenant with God must believe him to be God all-sufficient,' Gen.
   xvii. 1. The apostle, when he dissuadeth from worldliness, he produceth
   a promise of God's not forsaking us and leaving us utterly destitute:
   Heb. xiii. 5, Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be
   content with such things as you have. For he hath said, I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee.' On the other side, certainly, it is
   unbelief that is the cause of apostasy, or falling back from God: Heb.
   iii. 12, Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
   of unbelief in departing from the living God.' Certainly, when we have
   resigned up ourselves to Christ to do his work, we may trust him
   boldly, and serve him cheerfully; we need not look back to shift for
   ourselves. If you are willing to be his people, he will be your God and
   your Saviour, and then you may conclude that God, even our God, shall
   bless us,' Ps. lxvii. 6. He will not be wanting to those that
   unreservedly yield up themselves to his obedience.

   [3.] Consider that they are deluded hypocrites that will meddle no
   farther with religion than they can reconcile it with their worldly
   happiness. Whatever glorious notions they have of God, or pretences of
   admiring free grace, it is self-denial that Christ calleth for; and
   taking up our cross is the first lesson in his school. And true
   conversion is a turning from the creature to God, and beginneth in
   mortification; and baptism implieth a renunciation of the devil, the
   world, and the flesh. Therefore those that will save their worldly
   state, and launch out no further in the cause of religion than they may
   easily get ashore again when a storm cometh, and love and serve God no
   further than will stand with the contentment of the flesh, and divide
   their hearts between God and the world, give God but half, and the
   worst half; surely these were never sincere with God. It is an
   impossible design they drive on, to serve two masters, Mat. vi. 24. You
   must let go Christ and glory, if you be so earnest after the world, and
   so indulgent to the flesh.

   [4.] Consider how much it is your business to observe what maketh you
   fit or unfit for the kingdom of God. The aptitude or inaptitude of
   means is to be judged with respect to the end, as they help or hinder
   the attainment of your great end; for finis est mensura mediorum: Mat.
   vi. 22, The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
   single, thy whole body shall be full of light.' Now our great end is to
   enjoy God for ever. And what fitteth you for this,--looking back, or
   keeping the heart in heaven? Experience will show. The ob servant and
   watchful Christian will soon find where his great hinderance lieth. How
   much he findeth his heart down by minding the world, and how he needeth
   to wind it up again by faith and love: Ps. xxv. 1, Unto thee, O Lord,
   do I lift up my soul.' The world is the great impediment that keepeth
   him from God, and indisposeth him for his service, dampeth his love,
   and quencheth his zeal, and abateth his diligence; he will soon find
   how much more he might do for God if he could draw off his heart more
   from those inferior objects. This is the weight that presseth us down,
   and maketh us so cold and cursory in God's service.

   [5.] Consider, in the text, here is the kingdom of God, which is
   double--the kingdom of grace, and the kingdom of glory. The one is
   called, The kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,' Rev. i. 9; the other
   is called, His kingdom and glory,' 1 Thes. ii. 12. By the first we are
   prepared for the second; and the second is the great encouragement. Now
   they that look back are unfit for either the duties of Christians or
   the reward of Christians; he flincheth from his duty here, and shall be
   shut out of heaven at last: 2 Thes. i. 5, That ye may be counted worthy
   of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer.' They are only counted
   worthy who constantly and patiently look for it, and venture something
   on it.

   [6.] Consider the great loss you will incur by looking back after you
   have put your hand to the plough. You will lose all that you have
   wrought, and all that you have suffered.

   What you have wrought: 2 John 8, Look to yourselves, that ye lose not
   the things which ye have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.'
   You forfeit the reward of your good beginnings. A partial reward they
   may have in this life, while they continue their well-doing (for no man
   is a loser by God), but . not a complete and full reward till the life
   to come. Some overflowings of God's temporal bounty they may have, but
   not the crown of life and glory. So Ezek. xviii. 24, All his
   righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.' All is
   obliterated and forgotten and made void, as to any interest in the
   great reward. This was represented in the type of the Nazarite: Num.
   vi. 12, The days that were before shall be lost, because his separation
   was defiled.' He was to begin all anew. All that you have suffered, as
   a man may make some petty losses for Jesus Christ: Gal. iii. 4, Have ye
   suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.' This maketh all
   the cost and expense that you have been at to be to no purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE EXCELLENCY OF SAVING FAITH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that
   believe to the saving of the soul.--Heb. X. 39.

   IN the verse immediately preceding there is a dreadful doom pronounced
   on apostates, that God will take no pleasure in them. Now lest they
   should be much affrighted with the terror of it, and suppose that he
   had too hard an opinion of them, he showeth, that though he did warn
   them, he did not suspect them, presuming other things of them,
   according to their profession: But we are not of them that draw back
   unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

   In the words two things are observable:--

   1. The denial of the suspicion of their apostasy.

   2. An assertion of the truth and constancy of their faith.

   That clause I shall insist upon, ek pisteos eis peripoiesin psuches.
   Where, first, take notice of their faith, ek pisteos; secondly, their
   perseverance, eis peripoiesin psuches. The word signifieth their
   purchasing, acquiring, obtaining, finding the soul; meaning thereby,
   that though they lost other things, they did not lose their souls.

   Doct. That a true and sound faith will cause us to save the soul,
   though with the loss of other things.

   1 Peter i. 5, Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto
   salvation.' It is the power of God indeed that keepeth. He that
   reserveth heaven for us reserveth and keepeth us for heaven. But by
   what instrument or means? By faith. To depend upon an invisible God for
   a happiness that lieth in an invisible world, when in the meantime he
   permitteth us to be harassed with difficulties and troubles, requireth
   faith; and by faith alone can the heart be upheld, till we obtain this
   salvation. So ver. 9, Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of
   your souls.' It is faith maketh us row against the stream of flesh and
   blood, and deny its cravings, that we may obtain eternal salvation at
   length. The flesh is for sparing and favouring the body; but faith is
   for saving the soul. That is the end and aim of faith.

   To make this evident to you:--

   1. I shall prove that all other things must be hazarded for the saving
   of the soul.

   2. That nothing will make us hazard all things for the purchasing or
   acquiring the salvation of the soul but only faith.

   1. That all other things must be hazarded for the saving of the soul:
   Mat. x. 39, He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth
   his life for my sake shall find it.' So it is repeated again upon the
   occasion of the doctrine of self-denial, Mat. xvi. 25, 26. The saving
   of the soul is more than the getting and keeping or having of all the
   world; for the world concerneth only the body and bodily life, but the
   saving of the soul concerneth eternal life. If life be lost temporally,
   it is secured to eternity, when we shall have a life which no man can
   take from us. And the case standeth thus: that either we must bring
   eternal perdition upon ourselves, or else obtain eternal salvation.
   They that are thirsty of life bodily, and the comforts and interests of
   it, are certainly prodigal of their salvation. But on the other side,
   if we are willing to venture life temporal, and all the interests
   thereof, for the saving of the soul, we make a good bargain: that which
   is left for a while is preserved to us for ever. In short, so much as
   God is to be preferred before the creature, heaven before the world,
   the soul before the body, eternity before time, so much doth it concern
   us to have the better part safe. And as men in a great fire and general
   conflagration will hazard their lumber to preserve their treasure,
   their money, or their jewels, so should we take care, that if we must
   lose one or other, that the better part be out of hazard; and whatever
   we lose by the way, we may be sure to come well to the end of our
   journey.

   2. That nothing will make us hazard all things for the purchasing or
   acquiring the salvation of the soul, but only faith. The flesh is
   importunate to be pleased. Sense saith to us, Favour thyself, that is,
   spare the flesh; but faith saith, Save thy soul. Faith, which
   apprehendeth things future and invisible, will teach us to value all
   things according to their worth, and to lose some present satisfaction
   for that future and eternal gain which the promises of God do offer to
   us. Now faith doth this two ways:, by convincing us of the worth and of
   the truth of things promised by God through Christ. The apostle, when
   he bloweth his trumpet, and summoneth our reverence and attentive
   regard to the gospel, in that preface, 1 Tim. i. 15, he saith, This is
   a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners.' Salvation by Christ is worthy to
   be regarded above all things; and if it be true, all things should give
   place unto it. Now faith convinceth us of the worth and truth, and
   maketh us to take the thing promised for all our treasure and
   happiness, and the promise itself, or the word of God, for our whole
   security.

   (1.) It maketh us to take the thing promised for all our treasure and
   happiness: Mat. vi. 19-21, Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
   earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
   through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where
   neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and
   steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.' It
   highly concerneth us to consider what we make our treasure. Worldly
   things are subject to many accidents, and deserve not our love nor
   esteem. Only heavenly things deserve to be our treasure. If our hearts
   be set upon these things, it is a sign we value what Christ hath
   offered. So 2 Cor. iv. 18, While we look not at the things which are
   seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are
   seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.' We
   make these things our end, and scope, and happiness. It is easy to
   prove the worth of these things in the general, as it is easy to prove
   that eternity is better than time; that things incorruptible are better
   than those which are subject to corruption; that things exempted from
   casualty are better than those things which are liable to casualty, and
   are not out of the reach of robbery and violence. But to creatures
   wedded to sense and present enjoyment, it is difficult and hard to
   cause them to set their hearts on another world, and to lay up their
   hopes in heaven, and to part with all things which they see and love
   and find comfortable to their senses, for that God and glory which they
   never saw. This is the business of faith, or the work of the Spirit of
   illumination changing their hearts and minds. This general truth all
   will determine, as that things eternal are better than things temporal.
   But We under value these gracious promises, whose accomplishment must
   with patience be expected, whilst their future goodness cometh in
   actual competition with these bodily delights which we must forego, and
   those grievous bodily afflictions which we must endure, out of sincere
   respect to Christ and his ways. Therefore, before there can be any true
   self-denial, faith must incline us to this offered benefit, as our true
   treasure and happiness, whatever we forego or undergo to attain it.

   (2.) For the truth of it the word of God must be our whole security, as
   being enough to support our hearts in waiting for it, however God cover
   himself with frowns and an appearance of anger in those afflictions
   which befal us in the way thither. The word of God is all in all to his
   people: Thy testimonies have I taken as my heritage for ever; they are
   the rejoicing of my soul,' Ps. cxix. 111. If a man hath little ready
   money, yet if he have a heritage to live upon, or sure bonds, he is
   well paid. So is a believer rich in promises, which being the promises
   of the almighty and immutable God, and built upon the everlasting merit
   of Christ, are as good to him as performances, and therefore cause joy
   in some proportion as if the things were in hand: Heb. xi. 13, These
   all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen
   them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them;' and Ps.
   lvi. 4, In God will I praise his word, in God have I put my trust; I
   will not fear what man can do unto me.' Faith resteth upon God's word,
   who is able to save to the uttermost all that come to him by Christ.

   Use 1. Is information concerning a weighty truth, namely, what the
   faith is by which the just do live. It is such a trust or confidence in
   God's promises of eternal life through Jesus Christ as that we forsake
   all other hopes and happiness whatsoever that we may obtain it.

   To make good this description to you, let me observe:--

   1. That faith looketh mainly to heaven, or the saving of the soul, as
   the prime benefit offered to us by Jesus Christ. For all attend to
   this: 1 Tim. i. 16, For a pattern to them who should hereafter believe
   on him to life everlasting.' This was that they chiefly aimed at, and
   therefore called the end of our faith.' 1 Peter i. 9. For this end were
   the scriptures written: John xx. 31, These things are written that ye
   might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that
   believing ye might have life through his name.' The scriptures are
   written to direct us to know Christ aright, who is the kernel and
   marrow of all the scriptures, who is the great subject of the gospel;
   and that the chief benefit we have by him is eternal life, by which all
   our pains and losses for Christ are recompensed, and from whence we
   fetch our comfort all along during the course of our pilgrimage, and
   upon the hopes of which the life of grace is carried on, and the
   temptations of sense are defeated, so that this is the main blessing
   which faith aimeth at.

   2. That the sure grounds which faith goeth upon is God's promise
   through Jesus Christ; and so it implieth:--

   [1.] That there is a God, who is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek him;' for the apostle, pursuing this discourse, telleth us, Heb.
   xi. 6, that a man must believe God's being and bounty before he can do
   anything to the purpose for him.

   [2.] That this God hath revealed himself in Jesus Christ as willing to
   accept poor creatures who refuse not his new covenant and remedying
   grace, to pardon and life; for the guilty creature would stand at a
   distance, and not receive his offers with any comfort and satisfaction,
   had not God been in Christ reconciling the world to himself,' 2 Cor. v.
   19. But now they may be invited to come to him with hope, ver. 20. And
   his gracious promises, standing upon such a bottom and foundation, are
   the sooner believed: 2 Cor. i. 20, For the promises of God are in him,
   yea, and in him, amen, to the glory of God by us;' that is, the
   promises of God propounded in Christ's name are undoubtedly true; they
   are not yea and nay, but yea and amen. They do not say yea to-day, and
   nay to-morrow; but always yea, so it is, and amen, so it shall be,
   because they stand upon an immutable foundation, the everlasting merit
   and redemption of Christ.

   [3.] It implieth that the scriptures which contain these offers and
   promises are the word of God. For though God's veracity be
   unquestionable, how shall we know that we have his word? It is laid at
   pledge with us in the scriptures, which are the declaration of the mind
   of the eternal God. The promises are a part of those sacred scriptures
   which were written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and sealed
   with a multitude of miracles, and bear the very image and
   superscription of God (as everything which hath passed his hand hath
   his signature upon it, even to a gnat or pile of grass), and have been
   received and preserved by the church as the certain oracles of God, and
   blessed by him throughout all generations and successions of ages, to
   the convincing, converting, sanctifying, and comforting of many souls,
   and carry their own light, evidence, and recommendation to the
   consciences of all those who are not strangely perverted by their
   brutish lusts, and blinded by their worldly affections. For the apostle
   saith, By the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every
   man's conscience. For if our gospel be hid, it is hid to those who are
   lost: the god of this world having blinded their eyes, lest the light
   of the glorious gospel should shine unto them,' 2 Cor. iv. 2-4. Upon
   these grounds doth faith proceed, which I have mentioned the more
   distinctly that you might know how to excite faith; for besides praying
   for the Spirit of wisdom and illumination to open our eyes, we must use
   the means both as rational creatures and new creatures. And what means
   are more effectual than those mentioned?

   Is there not a God? If there be not a God, how did we come to be? Thou
   wert not made by chance; and when thou wert not, thou couldst not make
   thyself. Look upon thy body, so curiously framed, whose workmanship
   could this be but of a wise God? Upon thy soul, whose image and
   superscription doth it bear? Give unto Caesar the things which are
   Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.' Nay, look upward,
   downward, within thee, without thee, what dost thou see, hear, and
   feel, but the products and effects of an eternal power, wisdom, and
   goodness? Thou canst not open thine eyes, but the heavens are ready to
   say to thy conscience, Man, there is a God, an infinite eternal being,
   who made us and all things else.

   Now for the second: Hath not this God revealed himself gracious in
   Christ? Nature declareth there is a God, and scripture that there is a
   Christ. As there is one God, the first cause of all, infinitely
   powerful, wise, and good, therefore it is but reasonable that he should
   be served, and according to his own will. But we have faulted in our
   duty to our creator, and therefore are in dread of his justice.
   Certainly reasonable creatures have immortal souls, and so die not as
   the beasts; therefore there is no true happiness in these things
   wherein men ordinarily seek it. Is it not then a blessed discovery that
   God hath brought life and immortality to light by Jesus Christ; that he
   sent him into the world to be a propitiation, and to satisfy his
   justice, and to redeem us from our guilty fears? And shall we neglect
   this great salvation brought to us by Jesus Christ, or coldly seek
   after it? Surely God is willing to be reconciled to man, or else he
   would presently have plunged us into our eternal state, as he did the
   angels upon their first sinning. But he waiteth, and beareth with many
   in conveniences; he beseecheth us, and prayeth us to be reconciled. And
   how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which was first
   spoken by the Lord, and then confirmed unto us by them that heard him;
   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers
   miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?' Heb.
   2-4. Would holy men cheat the world with an imposture, or would God be
   accessory in lending his power to .do such marvellous things? It cannot
   be.

   And then for the third: Is not this a part of the word of God, which
   holy men have written to consign it to the use of the church in all
   ages? 1 John ii. 25, This is the promise which he hath promised us,
   eternal life.' Is not this God's promise? And will not God be mindful
   and regardful of his word? He was wont to be tender of it: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 2, Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name;' above
   all that is named, or famed, or spoken and believed of God. His truth
   and trustiness is most conspicuous. In the new covenant he hath given
   his solemn oath, as well as his word, that the heirs of promise might
   have strong consolation,' Heb. vi. 18. What is the matter that my
   belief of these things is so cold and ineffectual? If this be God's
   promise, and he hath put in no exception against me to exclude me from
   the benefit of this promise, what is the reason why I can no more
   encourage myself in the Lord to seek after this salvation, but am
   disturbed so often by distracting fears and cares, and so easily misled
   by vain delights? Thus should we excite our faith.

   But I digress too long.

   3. The nature of this faith I express by a trust and confidence. There
   is in faith an assent, which is sufficient when the object requireth no
   more. As there are some speculative principles which are merely to be
   believed, as they lead on to other things, Heb. xi. 3, there an
   intellectual assent sufficeth. But there are other things which are
   propounded, not only as true, but good. There, not only an intellectual
   assent is required, but a practical assent, or such as is joined with
   consent and affiance; as suppose when Christ promiseth eternal life to
   the serious Christian or mortified believer; there must be not only an
   assent, or a believing that this proposal and offer is Christ's, and
   that it is true; but there must be a consent to choose it for my
   portion and happiness, and then a confidence and dependence upon Christ
   for it, though it lie out of sight, and in the meantime I be exercised
   with sundry difficulties and temptations. Trust is not a bare opinion
   of Christ's fidelity, but a dependence upon his word. I do believe
   there is a God, and that there is a Christ, I do well. I do believe
   that this God in Christ hath brought life and immortality to light, I
   do well still; but I must do more. I believe that he hath assured his
   disciples and followers, that if they continue faithful with him, they
   shall have eternal life: John v. 24, Verily, verily, I say unto you, he
   that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation.' I know that
   Christ hath fidelity and sufficiency enough to make good his word. This
   is well, but I must go farther; that is to say, I must choose this
   eternal life that is offered to me for my felicity and portion; this is
   consent: and I must continue with patience in well doing, depending
   upon his faithful word whilst I am in the pursuit of it; this is trust
   or confidence. As this world is vanity, and hath nothing in it worthy
   to be compared with the hopes which Christ hath given me of a better
   life, so I choose it for my happiness. But as I judge him faithful that
   hath promised, and depend upon him that he will make good his word,
   though this happiness be future, and lieth in another, an unseen, an
   unknown world, to which there is no coming but by faith, this is the
   trust, and by that name it is often expressed in scripture. It is
   nothing else but a sure and comfortable dependence upon God through
   Jesus Christ, in the way of well-doing, for the gift of eternal life:
   Ps. cxii. 7, His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.' So Isa. xxvi.
   3, Thou keepest him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee,
   because he trusteth in thee.' The New Testament also useth this term, 2
   Cor. iii. 4, Such trust have we through Christ to Godward;' and 1 Tim.
   iv. 10, For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
   trust in the living God.' Well, then, this trust is more than an assent
   or bare persuasion of the mind that the promises are true; yea, it is
   more than a motion of the will towards them as good and satisfying; for
   it noteth a quiet repose of the heart on the fidelity and mercy of God
   in Christ, that he will give this blessedness, if we do in the first
   place seek after it. The more we cherish this confidence, the more sure
   we are of our interest, both in Christ and the promise: Heb. iii. 6,
   Whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence, and rejoicing of
   hope firm unto the end;' and ver. 14, We are made partakers of Christ,
   if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;' and
   Heb. x. 35, a little before the text, Cast not away your confidence,
   which hath great recompense of reward.' In all which places confidence
   noteth our resolute engaging in the heavenly life, because we depend
   upon Christ's rewards in another world. In our passage to heaven we
   meet with manifold temptations; we are assaulted both on the right hand
   and on the left with the terrors of sense, which are a discouragement
   to us, and the delights of sense, which are a snare to us. Confidence
   or trust fortifieth us against both these temptations, the
   difficulties, dangers, and sufferings which we meet with in our passage
   to heaven, yea, though it should be death itself; for faith seeth the
   end glorious, and that the salvation of our souls is sure and near if
   we continue faithful with Christ. On the other side, affiance or trust
   draweth the heart to better things, and we can easily want or miss the
   contentments of the flesh, the pomp, and ease, and pleasure of the
   present life, because our hearts are in heaven, and we have more
   excellent things in view and pursuit. .This breedeth a weanedness from
   the baits of the flesh, and a rejection and contempt of what would take
   us off from the pursuit of eternal life: 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27, I run not
   as one that is uncertain;' as if he had said, I am confident, therefore
   I am mortified to the world.

   4. The immediate fruit and effect of it is a forsaking all other hopes
   and happiness for Christ's sake, and for the blessedness which he
   offereth. That forsaking all belongeth to this affiance and trust is
   plain, because I can neither trust God nor be true to him till I can
   venture all my happiness upon this security; and if God calleth me to
   it, actually forsake all upon these hopes. This will appear to you by
   these arguments:--

   [1.] By the doctrinal descriptions of the gospel-faith. Our Lord hath
   told us that the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman: Mat. xiii.
   45, 46, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly
   pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
   all that he had, and bought it.' And certainly he knew the nature of
   that faith better than we do. Many cheapen the pearl of price, but they
   do not go through with the bargain, because they do not sell all to
   purchase it. No; you must have such a sense of the excellency and truth
   of salvation by Christ, that you must choose it, and let go all that is
   inconsistent with this choice and trust. You must be resolved to let go
   all your sinful pleasures, profit, and reputation, and your life
   itself, rather than forfeit these hopes. So Luke xiv. 26, If any man
   come unto me, and hate not father and mother, and wife and children,
   and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life, he cannot be my
   disciple.' So ver. 33, Whosoever he be that forsaketh not all that he
   hath, cannot be my disciple.' After such express declarations of the
   will of Christ, why should we think of going to heaven at a cheaper
   rate, and that the covenant will be modelled and brought down to our
   humours? Christ's service will bring trouble with it. All that is
   precious in the world must be renounced, or else we shall not be able
   to hold out. The same is inferred out of the doctrine of self-denial,
   Mat. xvi. 24. It is the immediate fruit, yea, the principal act of our
   trust; for if God be trusted as our felicity, he must be loved above
   all, and all things must give way to God. The same is inferred out of
   the baptismal covenant, which is a renouncing the devil, the world, and
   the flesh, and a giving up ourselves to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as
   our God. This renouncing implieth a venturing of all, that we may
   obtain this blessedness, or eternal life.

   [2.] By all the extraordinary calls and trials that are propounded as a
   pattern to us. Faith was ever a venturing all, and a forsaking all,
   upon the belief of God's veracity. Let us see Noah's faith: Heb. xi. 7,
   By faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet,
   prepared an ark for the saving of his house.' That warning that God
   gave him of the flood was extraordinary, but they were of things not
   seen as yet;' whilst these things were in the mind of God, no man or
   angel could know them; and after God revealed them, there was nothing
   but his bare word for it. But Noah believed, and what then? At God's
   prescription, with vast expense, he prepareth an ark, and that was
   selling all. He was of a vast estate, or else he could not have
   prepared such a fabric, so many years in building, and so furnished;
   but this was the prescribed means to save his household. In the next
   place, let us consider Abraham's trial, who was the father of the
   faithful.' His first trial was, Heb. xi. 8, By faith Abraham, when he
   was called to go out to a place which he should afterwards receive for
   an inheritance, obeyed, not knowing whither he went.' Here was trusting
   and venturing all upon God's call. He forsook his kindred, and father's
   house, and all, to seek an abode he knew not where. Therefore we must
   forsake the world, and all things therein, yea, life itself, having our
   thoughts and affections fixed on heaven. There must be a total
   resignation of heart and will to God. We owe God blind obedience. To
   forsake our country, kindred, friends, inheritance, is a sore trial;
   yet this was done by him, and must be done by all that will be saved:
   we must deny ourselves, take up our cross, and forsake father and
   mother, wife and children, all relations. All this he did for a land
   which he neither knew where it was nor the way to it. Our God hath told
   us, he will bring us into the heavenly Canaan. His second trial you
   have recorded, ver. 17, By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up
   Isaac; and he that received the promises offered up his only son,' God
   would try Abraham, that he might be an example of faith to all future
   generations, whether Abraham loved God or his son Isaac more. But he
   did not shrink upon trial; he offered him up; that is, in his heart he
   had parted with him and given him wholly unto God, and made all ready
   for the offering, being assured of God's fidelity; even Isaac, upon
   whom the promises were settled, must be offered. Children, dear
   children, everything must be given up to God. In the next place,
   consider we the Israelites in the Red Sea; Heb. xi. 29, By faith they
   passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land,' God commands Moses, when
   in straits, to strike the sea with his rod, and Israel to pass forward,
   and expect the salvation of God, promising to deliver them. They did
   so, and the sea was divided, and the waters stood like walls and
   mountains, as if they had been congealed and turned to ice, and the
   bottom, which never saw sun before, is made like firm ground, without
   mud and quicksands. Thus entirely will God be trusted by his people,
   and they must put their all into his hands. If God will have it so,
   faith must find a way through the great deep. No dangers so great that
   we must decline. Come we now to the New Testament; Christ's trial of
   the young man: Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, sell all that thou
   hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,'
   Mark x. 21. But he could not venture on Christ's command, and went away
   sad. The promise of eternal life and treasure in heaven could not part
   the young man and his great estate, and therefore he continued
   incapable of eternal bliss. This young man is set forth in the Gospel
   as a warning to others. So in Peter's trial, Mat. xiv. 29, 30. If
   Christ bid Peter come to him upon the waters, Peter must come, though
   the storm continueth, and he be ready to sink at every step.

   [3.] By all the instances of faith in the ordinary and common case of
   salvation. Moses had faith, therefore he forsook all honours,
   pleasures, and treasures, for he trusted God, and waited for the
   recompense of reward, Heb. xi. 24-26. It is endless in instancing in
   all: take these, Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your
   goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have a better and more enduring
   substance.' They were not discouraged, but took this rapine joyfully,
   which argued a lively faith in Christ, and a sincere love to him. It
   goeth near to the hearts of worldlings to part with these things; but
   they valued Christ as infinitely more precious than all the wealth of
   the world. If they lost their goods, yet if they lost not Christ, they
   were happy enough; for then they still kept the title to the enduring
   substance. Thus you see what is faith; such a trusting in God for
   eternal life as maketh us willing to forsake all, rather than be
   unfaithful to Christ. Others may delude you, enchant your souls asleep
   with fine strains of ill-understood and abused grace. But if you would
   not be deceived, take the faith and Christianity of Christ's
   recommendation, which is the faith now described. Are we in the place
   of God, that we can make heaven narrower or broader for you? Surely it
   is grace, rich grace, that God will pardon us, and call us to eternal
   life by Jesus Christ. Now, if you will have it, you must believe to the
   salvation of the soul, so believe, as to quit all other things to
   obtain it.

   Use 2. Is for examination. Let us examine our spiritual condition,
   whether it be good or bad, whether our faith be sincere, our profession
   real, whether we tend to perdition or to salvation, whether we believe
   to the saving of the soul; that is, if we care not what we lose, so we
   may obtain the heavenly inheritance. Have you such a trust as that you
   can venture the loss of something which is dear to you for this trust;
   yea, not only something, but all things? Certainly we have not a true
   belief of the promise of eternal life if we can venture nothing upon
   it, hazard nothing for it. Now we venture things upon the account of
   God's promise four ways:--

   [1.] In a way of mortification.

   [2.] In a way of self-denial.

   [3.] In a way of charity.

   [4.] In a way of submission to providence.

   [1.] In a way of mortification. Denying ourselves the sinful pleasures
   of the senses. Our sins were never worth the keeping; these must always
   be parted with, other things but at times; therefore I can venture but
   little upon the security of eternal life, if I cannot deny my fleshly
   and worldly lusts, and a little vain pleasure, for that fulness of joy
   which is at God's right hand for evermore. I have God's word for it,
   that if I mortify the deeds of the body I shall live, Rom. viii. 13. It
   is yet hard to abjure accustomed delights; and to hearts pleasantly
   set, the strictness of a holy life seemeth grim and severe; but a
   believer, that hath a prospect into eternity, knoweth that it is better
   to deny the flesh than to displease God--to take a little pains in
   rectifying our disordered hearts and distempered souls, than to endure
   pains for evermore; and that a little momentary delight is bought too
   dear, if it be bought with the loss of eternal joys. No; let me lose my
   lusts rather than lose my soul, saith he. Every man's heart cleaveth to
   those things which he judgeth best, and the more it cleaveth to better
   things, the more it is withdrawn from other things. Therefore faith,
   showing us the truth and worth of heavenly things, and taking God's
   word for its security, it mastereth our desires and carnal affections.
   It is the stranger and pilgrim' (whose mind is persuaded of things to
   come, and whose heart is set upon them) that abstaineth from fleshly
   lusts,' 1 Peter ii. 11. Upon the assurance of God's word he is taking
   his journey into another world. Though the flesh will rebel, yet he
   counterbalanceth the good and evil which the flesh proposeth, with the
   good and evil of the other world which the word of God proposeth, and
   so learneth more and more to contemn the pleasures of sin and curb his
   unruly passions. Mortify your members upon earth, for your life is hid
   with Christ in God,' Col. iii. 3-5. And they that look for a life of
   glory hereafter will choose a life of purity here upon earth. It is the
   unbeliever findeth such an impotency in resisting present temptations;
   he hath not any sense, or not a deep sense, of the world to come.

   [2.] In a way of self-denial. What! can you venture and forego that way
   upon the security of God's promise? Mortification concerneth our lusts,
   and self-denial our interests. What interest can you venture upon the
   warrant of the promise? Christ saith, He that denieth me before men, I
   will deny him before my Father in heaven,' Luke xii. 9; and again,
   Whosoever will save his life shall lose it,' &c., Luke ix. 24; and once
   more, ver. 26, Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him
   shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in his glory.' Now urge
   the soul with the promises. Am I willing to hazard my temporal
   conveniences for the enduring substance? to incur shame and blame with
   men, that I may be faithful with God, and own his interest in the
   world? and do I so when it actually cometh to a trial? The heart is
   deceitful, and a temptation in conceit and imagination is nothing to a
   temptation in act and deed. Therefore, when your resolutions are
   assaulted by temptations of any considerable strength, do you acquit
   yourself with good fidelity? Can you trust God when he trieth your
   trust in some necessary point of confession, which may expose you to
   some loss, shame, and hazard in the world?

   [3.] In a way of charity and doing good with your estates. That
   religion is worth nothing that costs nothing; and when all is laid out
   upon pomp and pleasure and worldly ends, as the advancing of your
   families and relations, and little or nothing for God upon the security
   of his promise, or only so much as the flesh can spare, to hide your
   self-pleasing and self-seeking in other things. Can you practise upon
   that promise, and try your faith: Luke xii. 33, Sell that you have, and
   give alms; provide yourselves bags that wax not old, a treasure in the
   heavens that faileth not.' What have you ventured in this kind? Do you
   believe that he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord'? and that
   he will be your paymaster? Do you look upon no estate so sure as that
   which is trusted in Christ's hands? And are you content to be at some
   considerable cost for eternal life? Most men love a cheap gospel, and
   the flesh engrosseth all. Faith gets little from them to be laid out
   for God. Do not these men run a fearful hazard? And while they are so
   over-careful to preserve their estates to themselves and families, do
   they believe to the saving of their souls? Or if they do not preserve
   their estates, but waste them, and are at great costs for their lusts,
   they do nothing considerably or proportionably for God. This is saving
   to the flesh, and they shall of the flesh reap corruption.'

   [4.] In a way of submission to providence. Whether you will or no, you
   are at God's disposal, and cannot shift yourselves out of his hands,
   either here or hereafter. But yet it is a part of your duty voluntarily
   to surrender yourselves to be disposed of and ordered by God according
   to his pleasure: to be content to be what he will have you to be, and
   to do what he will have you to do and suffer, is included in selling
   all. You must submit to be at God's finding, which is that poverty of
   spirit spoken of Mat. v. 3, Blessed are the poor in spirit;' such whose
   minds and spirits are subdued, and brought under obedience to God. You
   must be content to enjoy what God will have you to enjoy, and to want
   what he will have you want, and to lose what he will have you lose: 2
   Sam. xv. 26, 27, and Job i. 21, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
   away; blessed be the name of the Lord.' Many seem to resign all--goods,
   life, and all--to the will of God. But it is because they secretly
   think in their hearts that God will never put them to the trial, or
   take from them what they resign to him; but they are not prepared for a
   submission to all events. Like those that make large promises to
   others, when they think they will not take them at their words. So
   their hearts secretly except, and reserve much of that they resign to
   God. But this is false-dealing, and is shown in part in murmuring when
   God taketh anything from us.

THE EXCELLENCY OF SAVING FAITH.

   Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.--1
   Pet. I. 9.

   THE apostle here giveth a reason why believers rejoice in the midst of
   afflictions; they are qualified thereby to receive salvation, yea, in
   part have it already, Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of
   your souls.'

   In which words observe:--

   1. The benefit: the salvation of our souls.

   2. The grace which qualifieth us for that benefit: faith.

   3. The respect between the benefit and the grace; it is te'los, the
   end, or reward.

   1. The benefit, which may be considered as consummated, or as begun;
   and accordingly the word Komizo'menoi must be interpreted. If you
   consider it as to consummation and actual possession, so we receive it
   at death, when our self-denying obedience is ended; and for the present
   we are said to receive it, because we are sure to receive it at the
   close of our days. We believe now that we shall at length have it, and
   therefore rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. (2.) If you
   consider it with respect to inchoation or begun possession, we have ah
   undoubted right now, and some beginnings of it in the consolations of
   the Spirit. Now we receive it in the promises; we receive it in the
   first-fruits, which are some forerunning beams of the day light of
   eternal glory.

   2. The grace which qualifieth and giveth us a title to this benefit is
   faith. The word faith is taken in scripture sometimes for fides quae
   creditur; sometimes for fides quâ creditur, for the doctrine or grace
   of faith. The first acceptation will make a good sense here, namely,
   that the whole tenor of Christian doctrine leadeth us to the
   expectation of, and diligent pursuit after, eternal salvation. It is
   the whole drift of the Christian religion. But I take it rather for the
   grace. This is the prime benefit which faith aimeth at, as I shall show
   you by and by.

   3. The respect between faith and salvation. It is te'los, the end; or
   the word signifieth the fruit and the reward. As te'los is taken for an
   end and scope, the scripture favoureth that notion: kata skopo`n
   dio'ko, I press towards the mark or scope, Phil. iii. 14. And 2 Cor.
   iv. 18, skopountes, the salvation of our souls is the prime benefit
   which faith is not only allowed, but required to aim at. A believer
   levelleth and directeth all his actions to this end, that at length he
   may obtain eternal life. Sometimes it is put for the fruit or reward:
   Rom. vi. 22, Being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
   have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.' The issue
   of all, the final result, was your salvation.

   The point that I shall insist on is this:--

   Doct. That the end and reward of faith is the salvation of our souls.

   I shall open the point by explicating three questions:--

   1. What is this salvation of our souls?

   2. What right the believer hath to it?

   3. What is that saving faith which giveth us a title to it? The last is
   most important.

   1. What is the salvation of the soul? It is not meant of temporal
   deliverance, or an escape from danger, as some would affix that sense
   upon it, but of eternal life, or our happy estate in heaven. This
   .belongeth to our whole man, the body as well as the soul; but the soul
   is the chief part of man, and that which is first glorified. When men
   come first into the world, first the body is framed, and then the soul
   cometh after; as we see in the creation of Adam, first his body was
   organised, and then God breathed into him the spirit of life. And we
   see it in common generation, when the body is first framed in the womb,
   then it is quickened by a living soul. This lower region of the world
   is properly the place of bodies, therefore reason requires that the
   body, which is a citizen of the world, should first be framed, that it
   may be a receptacle for the soul, which is a stranger, and cometh from
   the region of spirits that is above. But when we must remove into these
   heavenly habitations, then it is quite otherwise; for then the soul, as
   a native of that place, is presently admitted, but the body, as a
   stranger, is forced to reside in the grave till the day of judgment;
   and then, for the sake of the soul, our bodies also are admitted into
   heaven. This is the ordinary law for all private persons. Christ,
   indeed, who is the head of the church, and the prince of this world and
   that which is to come, his body as well as his human spirit was made a
   denizen of heaven as soon as he ascended. He entered into heaven not as
   a private citizen, but as king and lord of the heavenly Jerusalem, and
   therefore carried both body and soul along with him. But as to us,
   first the soul goeth there, as into his ancient seat and proper
   habitation, and afterwards the body followeth.

   Well, then--[1.] At death our souls go to Christ, and enter into a
   state of happiness: Phil. i. 23, I desire to be dissolved, and to be
   with Christ.' The soul is not annihilated after death, nor doth it
   sleep till the resurrection, nor is it detained by the way from
   immediate passing into glory; but if it be the soul of a believer, as
   soon as it is loosed from the body it is with Christ: Luke xxiii. 43,
   Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.' He
   asked to be remembered when Christ came into his kingdom; and Christ
   assureth him of a reception there that day, as soon as he should
   expire.

   [2.] In due time the body is raised and united to the soul, and then
   Christ will be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that
   believe,' 2 Thes. i. 10. Such glory and honour will be put upon those
   who are but newly crept out of dust and rottenness; the saints
   themselves, and all the spectators, shall wonder at it.

   [3.] There is another period in this happiness, our everlasting
   habitation in heaven, near unto the throne of God, and in the presence
   of his glory: John xiv. 2, In my Father's house are many mansions.'
   There we shall also have the company of angels and blessed spirits, and
   make up one society with them: Heb. xii. 23, To the general assembly
   and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God
   the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.' This is
   the sum of the salvation which we expect, or our everlasting happiness
   with God in heaven.

   2. What is the right of believers, or the interest of faith in this
   great benefit?

   I answer--

   [1.] It doth not merit this reward, for it is not a reward of due debt
   by virtue of any intrinsic righteousness in, us, or any thing that we
   can do and suffer, but of mere grace and favour: Eph. ii. 8, For by
   grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the
   gift of God.' The apostle is very tender of the honour of grace, and
   the interest of grace in our salvation. From the first step to the last
   period, all is of grace; and this glory of his free grace God must not
   be robbed of, neither in whole nor in part. We have all from his
   elective love, we have all from the merit and righteousness of Christ,
   and all from the almighty operation of the sanctifying Spirit. Faith
   itself is a gift and fruit of God's grace in us: To you it is given to
   believe,'' Phil. i. 29. Therefore surely it is God's free grace,
   favour, and good-will which doth freely bestow that salvation on the
   elect, which Christ by his merit hath purchased; and that very faith by
   which we apply and make out our actual claim and title is wrought in us
   by the Spirit; so that there is nothing in the persons to whom all this
   is given to induce God to confer so great benefit on us.

   [2.] Though it be an undeserved favour, upon which our works have no
   meritorious, influence, yet believers have an undoubted right by the
   grant and promise of God, wherein they may comfort themselves, and
   which they may plead before God: John iii. 16, God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
   should not parish, but have life everlastingly;' and John v. 2-i,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and believeth
   in him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
   condemnation, but is passed from death to life.' And in many places
   where the believer is qualified as the heir of glory. He that
   entertaineth Christ's doctrine, and receiveth and owneth him as the
   true Messiah and Saviour of the world, and dependeth upon him, and
   obeyeth him, this man hath a full right and new-covenant title to
   eternal life.

   [3.] He hath not oily a new-covenant right, but a begun possession. We
   have some small beginnings, earnests, and foretastes of it in this
   life; partly in the graces, partly in the comforts of the Spirit.

   (1.) In the graces of the Holy Spirit. For salvation is begun in our
   new birth, Titus iii. 5; and therefore sanctifying grace is called
   immortal,' or incorruptible seed,' 1 Peter i. 23. There is an eternal
   principle put into them which carrieth them to eternal ends. The life
   is begun in all that shall be saved, and it is still working towards
   its final perfection. The apostle telleth us, that he that hateth his
   brother hath not eternal life abiding in him,' 1 John iii. 15; whereby
   he implieth that he that loveth his brother, or hath any saving grace,
   he hath eternal life begun in him.

   (2.) As to comforts, so they have some foretastes of that sweetness
   which is in heaven by the life and exercise of faith, which is followed
   with peace and joy, Rom. xv. 13; or in their approaches to God in the
   word and prayer, where God most familiarly manifests himself unto his
   people, 1 Peter i. 3; or upon some apprehensions of his favour, or the
   exercise of hope and love, 2 Peter i. 8. By these or the like ways, the
   Spirit of God giveth us the foretaste. Surely such an author, such an
   object, must needs put ravishing and heavenly joy into the heart of a
   believer.

   (3.) They are also made meet to partake of the heavenly inheritance,
   Col. i. 12. There is jus haereditarium, and jus aptitudinale. The
   difference is as between an heir grown and in his nonage, when a child
   in the cradle. As their natures are more renewed and purified, and
   their souls weaned from the delights of sense, they are changed into
   the divine nature.

   3. What is that saving faith which giveth us a title to it? This
   deserveth to be cleared, that we may not deceive ourselves with a false
   claim.

   Saving faith is such a believing in Christ, for reconciliation with
   God, and the everlasting fruition of him in glory, as maketh us to
   forsake all things in the world, and give up ourselves to the conduct
   of the word and Spirit for the obtaining of it.

   [1.] The general nature of it I express by believing. There is in it
   assent, consent, and affiance.

   (1.) Assent. That leadeth on the rest, when we believe the truth of
   God's word, Acts xxiv. 14, 15, especially those practical truths which
   do most nearly concern our recovery to God; as concerning man's sin and
   misery, that we have broken his laws, and are obnoxious to his justice,
   and have deserved punishment for our sins, Rom. iii. 23. And concerning
   Christ, his person and office, that he is the Son of God, and that he
   came from God, to bring home sinners to God, and what he hath done to
   reconcile us to him: 1 Peter iii. 18, For Christ also hath once
   suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us
   to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.'
   And also concerning your duty and happiness, the end and the way. There
   is no other end and happiness but God, no other way but the Mediator,
   and the means appointed by him, John xiv. 6. Now these and such like
   truths must be believed--that is, in the sense we are now upon,
   assented unto as faithful sayings, and worthy of all acceptation and
   regard.

   (2.) There is a consent in faith, whether you apply it to the word or
   Christ. If Christ be propounded as the object of it, it is called a
   receiving: John i. 12, But as many as received him, to them gave he
   power to become the sons of God.' So the word: Acts ii. 41, They gladly
   received his word;' that is, embraced the gospel covenant, being really
   affected with what he had spoken concerning their sin and their duty.
   Without this, the assent is but intellectual and speculative, not
   practical; an opinion, not an act or motion of the new nature. I am to
   receive the Christ offered, to embrace the covenant propounded, to
   accept of the blessings offered for my happiness, and to resolve upon
   the duties required as my work. This is consent, or a hearty accepting
   of Christ, or the covenant of grace offered to us in his name.

   (3.) There is affiance, trust, dependence, or confidence, which is a
   quiet repose of heart in the mercy of God or fidelity of Christ, that
   he will give me pardon and life, if I seek after it in the way that he
   hath appointed. This cometh in upon the former; for when I consent to
   seek my happiness in God, through Christ, I depend upon the security of
   his word, that so doing I shall obtain it. This entitleth us to the
   reward: Heb. iii. 6, Whose house we are, if we hold fast the
   confidence, and rejoicing of hope firm unto the end;' and ver. 14, For
   we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
   confidence steadfast unto the end;' and Heb. x. 35, Cast not away your
   confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.' The happiness which
   Christ promiseth us is spiritual, and for the most part future, and
   lieth in an unseen and unknown world; but whilst we are engaged in the
   pursuit of it, we must depend upon his faithful word. That must be
   security enough to us, to engage us to continue with patience in the
   midst of manifold temptations, till we obtain what he offereth to us.
   These three must be often renewed--assent, consent, and affiance.

   [2.] It is a believing in Christ. I make Christ the special object of
   this belief, not as exclusive of the Father or the Spirit, but because
   of the peculiar reference which this grace hath to the Mediator in this
   new and gospel dispensation, which was appointed for the remedy of the
   collapsed estate of mankind. So Acts xx. 21, Repentance towards God,
   and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.' He speaks of repentance as
   respecting God, and faith as respecting Christ. These are the two
   recovering graces: repentance is necessary because of the duty we owe
   to our Creator and supreme Lord; and faith respects our Redeemer, who
   principally undertook our recovery to God. Christ is believed in, in
   order to the salvation of our souls.

   (1.) Because he purchased and procured this salvation for us as
   mediator of the new testament: Heb. ix. 15, He is the mediator of the
   new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the
   transgressions that were under the first covenant, they which are
   called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.' By the
   intervention of his death sins are expiated, that penitent believers
   might have everlasting life.

   (2.) Because it is by him promised, or in his name: 1 John ii. 25, This
   is the promise which he hath promised us, even eternal life.' Christ's
   great business as a prophet is to discover with certainty and clearness
   such a blessed estate that it may be commodious for our acceptance,
   laid at our doors; if we will take it, well and good. He is Amen, the
   faithful witness,' Rev. iii. 14, who came with a commission from heaven
   to assure the world of it; and to confirm his message, he wrought
   miracles, died, and rose again, and entered into that happiness which
   he spake of, that our faith and hope might be in God,' 1 Peter i. 21.
   Guilty man is fallen under the power and fear of death, and strangely
   haunted with doubts about the other world. Now, he that came to save us
   and heal us, did himself in our nature rise from the dead, and ascend
   into heaven, that he might give a visible demonstration, both of the
   resurrection and life to come, which he hath promised to us. And when
   he sent abroad messengers in his name to assure the world of it, their
   testimony was accompanied with divers signs and wonders, and gifts of
   the Holy Ghost, Heb. ii. 3, 4, that the stupid world might be alarmed
   to regard the offer, and by this evidence be assured of the truth of
   it; therefore still it is a believing in Christ.

   (3.) Because as king he doth administer and dispense the blessings of
   the new covenant; and among them, as the chief and principal, this
   salvation unto all those who are qualified. And therefore it is said,
   Heb. v. 9, Being made perfect through sufferings, he is become the
   author of eternal salvation to all that obey him.' Every effect must
   have some cause; and this noble and glorious effect of eternal
   salvation could have no other cause but Christ; and he, as perfected
   and consecrated, is the author and efficient cause of it. For as king,
   he sendeth down the Holy Ghost to reveal the gospel, and work faith in
   the hearts of men, to qualify them for pardon and salvation; and all
   those that sue for pardon and salvation in his name, by the plea of his
   blood before the throne of God, and promise obedience to his laws and
   institutes, he actually bestoweth pardon and eternal salvation upon
   them. There be many other ministerial and adjutant causes, which
   conduce to this effect. But he is the principal; and the word ai'tops,
   which signifieth a cause in general, is fitly by our translation termed
   the author of eternal salvation. So that still you see a new reason why
   saving faith should be described to be a believing in Christ.

   [3.] The prime benefits which faith respecteth I make to be
   two--reconciliation with God, and the everlasting fruition of him in
   glory.

   (1.) Reconciliation is necessarily eyed and regarded by the guilty
   soul.

   First, Because there hath been a breach by which we have lost God's
   favour and happiness. We have to do with a God whose nature engageth
   him to hate sin, and whose justice engageth him to punish it. And
   before we can be induced to treat with him, such a reconciliation is
   necessary for all mankind as that he should be willing to deal with
   them upon the term of a new covenant, wherein pardon and life might be
   offered to penitent believers. This reconciliation is spoken of, 2 Cor.
   v. 19, God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not
   imputing their trespasses: and hath committed unto us the word of
   reconciliation;' that is, upon the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice,
   ransom, and satisfaction, there was so much done towards an actual
   reconciliation with God, that he offered a conditional covenant to as
   many as were willing to enter into his peace. He provided a sufficient
   remedy for the pardon of sin, if men would as heartily accept of it as
   it was freely given them; and the office of ambassadors was appointed
   to beseech men so to do. And unless this had been done, a guilty soul
   could never be brought to love a holy, sin-hating God, engaged by
   justice to damn the sinner. But it must be a loving, reconciled God,
   that is willing to forgive, that can be propounded as an object of
   faith and love, or as an amiable God to us: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is
   forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.'

   Secondly, Reconciliation is necessarily eyed by the penitent believer,
   because this reconciliation and recovery by Christ consists both in the
   pardon of sin and the gift of the sanctifying Spirit.

   1st, One branch of the actual restitution of God's favour to us is the
   pardon of sin, without which we are not capable of life and happiness,
   Eph. i. 7. The possible conditional reconciliation consists in the
   offer of pardon, and the actual reconciliation in the actual pardon and
   forgiveness of our transgressions, and then the man beginneth to be in
   a blessed estate, Ps. xxxii. 1, 2.

   2dly, The other branch is the gift of the sanctifying Spirit, which is
   the great testimony and pledge of his love; then is our pardon
   executed, or actually applied to us, and we receive the atonement, Rom.
   v. 11; and 2 Cor. v. 18, All things are of God, who hath reconciled us
   to himself by Jesus Christ;' that is, all things which belong to the
   new creature, ver. 17. And that is the reason why God is said to
   sanctify as a God of peace, that is, as reconciled to us in Christ: see
   1 Thes. v. 23, And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly;' and Heb.
   xiii. 20, 21, Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
   our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of
   the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his
   will,' &c. And in all God's internal government with the saints, he
   showeth his pleasure or displeasure with the saints by giving or
   withholding and withdrawing the Spirit, as it were easy to prove to
   you. Well, then, you see the reasons why, in believing in Christ, we
   reflect the eye of our faith on reconciliation, as the prime initial
   benefit.

   (2.) The next great consummating benefit is the everlasting fruition of
   God in glory; for Christ's office is to recover us to God, and bring us
   to God, which is never fully and completely done till we come to
   heaven. Therefore the saving of the soul is the prime benefit offered
   to us by Jesus Christ, to which all other tend, as justification and
   sanctification, and by which all our pains and losses for Christ are
   recompensed, and from which we fetch our comfort all along the course
   of our pilgrimage, and upon the hopes of which the life of grace is
   carried on, and the temptations of sense are defeated. So that this is
   the main blessing which faith aimeth at: see the scriptures, 1 Tim. i.
   16, For a pattern to them who should hereafter believe on him to
   everlasting life.' Wherefore do men believe in Christ, but for this
   end, that they may obtain everlasting life? Wherefore were the
   scriptures written? John xx. 31, These things are written that ye might
   believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing,
   ye might have life through his name.' The scriptures are written that
   we might know Christ aright, who is the kernel and mar row of them; and
   the chief benefit we have by him is life, or the salvation of our
   souls; and therefore well may it be called in the text the end of our
   faith.'

   [4.] In the next place, I add the immediate acts and effects of it:--

   (1.) Such as maketh us to forsake all things in this world; and--

   (2.) Give up ourselves to the conduct of the word and Spirit, for the
   obtaining this happiness.

   (1.) To forsake all things in this world. As soon as we address
   ourselves seriously to believe, we turn our backs upon them--namely,
   upon the pleasures, and honours, and profits of this world. We forsake
   them in vow and resolution when we are converted and begin to believe,
   for conversion is a turning from the creature to God. As soon as we
   firmly believe, and hope for the fruition of God in glory, as purchased
   and promised by Christ, our hearts are weaned and withdrawn from the
   false happiness, not perfectly, but yet sincerely. And we actually
   renounce and forsake them at the call of God's providence, when they
   are inconsistent with our fidelity to Christ, and the hopes of that
   happiness which his promises offer to us. Now that our faith must be
   expressed by forsaking all, yea, that it is essential to faith, and
   nothing else is saving faith but this, as appeareth--

   First, By the doctrinal descriptions of it in the gospel (which I shall
   describe to you according to my usual method). Our Lord hath told us,
   Mat. xiii. 45, 46, that the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman
   seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price,
   he went and sold all that he had and bought it.' And surely he knew the
   nature of faith better than we do. Many cheapen the pearl of price, but
   they do not go through with the bargain, be cause they do not sell all
   to purchase it. Faith implieth such a sense of the excellency and truth
   of salvation by Christ that you must choose it, and let go all which is
   inconsistent with this choice and trust. All your sinful pleasures,
   profit, reputation, and life itself, rather than forfeit these hopes:
   Luke xiv. 26, If any man come to me, and hate not father and mother,
   and brother and sisters, yea, and his own life, he cannot be my
   disciple;' and ver. 33, Whosoever he be that forsaketh not all that he
   hath, he cannot be my disciple.' After such express declarations of the
   will of Christ, why should we think of going to heaven at a cheaper
   rate? Christ must be preferred above all that is nearest or dearest, or
   else he will not be for our turn, nor we for his. The same is inferred
   out of the doc trine of self-denial: Mat. xvi. 24, If any man will come
   after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.'
   For self-denial hath a greater relation to faith, and is nearer of kin
   to faith, than the world imagineth; it is the immediate fruit of our
   trust. If God be trusted as our supreme felicity, he must be loved
   above all things, and all things must give way to God. If Christ be
   trusted as the way to the Father, all things must be counted dung and
   loss that we may gain Christ, Phil. iii. 8. The same is inferred out of
   the baptismal covenant, which is a renouncing the devil, the world, and
   the flesh, and a choosing Father, Son, and Holy Ghost for our God. If
   there be a choosing, there must be a renouncing. The devil by the world
   tempts our flesh from the Christian hope; therefore idols must be
   renounced before we can have the true God for our God: Josh, xxiv. 23,
   Put away the strange gods which are among you, and in cline your heart
   to the Lord God of Israel.' Naturally our god is our belly while
   carnal, Phil. iii. 19. Mammon is our god, Mat. vi. 24. The devil is our
   god, Col. i. 13; and Eph. ii. 2, 3, Wherein in times past ye walked
   according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the
   power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of
   disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times
   past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
   and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
   others.' Besides the nature of the thing, baptism implieth this
   renunciation, 1 Peter iii. 21; and this renunciation is nothing else
   but a forsaking all that we may have eternal life by Christ

   Secondly, It appeareth by reasons:--

   First, For faith cannot be without this forsaking.

   Secondly, Nor this forsaking without faith.

   First, Faith cannot be without this forsaking; for faith implieth a
   sight of the truth and worth of those blessed things which are to come,
   and so to take the thing promised for our happiness, and the promise
   for our security. (1.) There is no true sound faith till we take the
   everlasting fruition of God in glory for our whole felicity; till our
   hearts be set upon it, and we do desire it, intend it, wait for it, as
   the chief good and blessedness. The upright heart is known by its
   treasure: Mat. vi. 20, 21, Lay up treasure in heaven; for where your
   treasure is, there your heart will be also.' Now, if this be so, other
   things will be lessened; all other hopes and happiness is nothing
   worth, and will appear so if compared with this better part, with what
   we account our treasure; you will see all this world is vanity, and
   hath nothing in it worthy to be compared with the salvation of our
   souls. (2.) There is no true faith where the word and promise of God is
   not taken for our security, so as our trust in his word may quiet and
   embolden us against temptations, and give us stronger consolation than
   all the visible things on earth, Ps. cxix. 111, and Heb. vi. 18. We
   should do more and go farther upon such a promise, than for all that
   man can give unto us. Earthly pleasures and possessions should be small
   things in regard to the promise of God. This should make us row against
   the stream of the flesh, and cross its desires and appetites, and deny
   the conveniences of the world, and all because we have God's promise of
   better things.

   Secondly, This forsaking cannot be without faith; because the flesh is
   importunate to be pleased with present satisfactions, and loth to part
   with things which we see and love for that God and glory which we never
   saw, to quit what is present for. what is future, and with patience to
   be expected. The flesh is for pleasing the body, but faith is for
   saving the soul: Heb. x. 39, ek pisteos eis peripoiesin psuches:
   purchasing the soul with the loss of other things. So that this is
   faith, nothing but faith, and other faith is not true and sound.

   (2.) It maketh us to give up ourselves to the conduct of the word and
   Spirit for obtaining this happiness. I add this, because the word is
   our rule, Gal. vi. 16; and the Spirit our guide, Rom. viii. 14. And
   faith is not only an apprehension of privileges, but a consent of
   subjection. And the sound believer devoteth himself to the love, fear,
   service, and obedience of God, 2 Cor. viii. 5: They first gave up
   themselves to the Lord, and to as by the will of God;' that is, to the
   apostles as Christ's messengers, to be directed in the way to heaven:
   Ps. cxix. 38, Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
   fear.' This now is saving faith.

   The use is, to exhort you to believe to the saving of the soul.

   To this end:--

   1. Because faith is the gift of God, beg the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation, that your eyes may be opened, that you may see what is the
   hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his in
   heritance in the saints,' &c., Eph. i. 17, 18. That you may be
   convinced of the truth and worth of the blessedness promised, and know
   and see it, not by a traditional report, but in the lively light of the
   Spirit, such as may affect and engage your hearts. Naturally we are
   purblind, 2 Peter i. 9; have no acute discerning, but in back and belly
   concernments. We know what is noxious or comfortable to the present
   life, pleasing or displeasing to the flesh; but are little affected
   with the danger of perishing for ever, the need of Christ, or the worth
   of salvation. And till God make a change, how slight and sensual are
   we!

   2. Think often and seriously how much the saving of the soul is better
   than the saving, or getting, or keeping all the world: Mat. xvi. 26,
   What will it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose
   his own soul?' So much as God is to be preferred before the creature,
   heaven before the world, eternity before time, the soul before the
   body; so much must this business of saving the soul have the
   preeminence, and be preferred before the interests of the body and the
   bodily life. But, alas! what poor things divert us from this happiness;
   the satisfying of the flesh, the pleasures of sin for a season; a
   little ease, or profit, or vainglory--this is all for which we slight
   heaven and our own salvation.

   3. Put yourselves into the way of salvation, by seeking reconciliation
   with God by Christ. You are invited in the universal conditional offer,
   John iii. 16. It is offered to all that will repent and believe, and
   there is no exception put in against you to exclude you; why then will
   you exclude yourself? Therefore, come forward in the way of faith, and
   God will help you.

   4. Mind often the genuine effect of the true faith. It makes you
   forsake all, that you may be obedient to Christ, and resolved upon it.

   Therefore consider--(1.) The necessity of it. You can neither trust God
   nor be true to him till your heart be loosened from the pleasures and
   profits and honours in the world, and you can venture all upon the
   security of his promise. Other hopes and happiness will divert us from
   the true happiness, and the good seed will be choked by the cares of
   this world and voluptuous living, that you can bring nothing to
   perfection. Either you will turn aside by open defection or apostasy,
   or else be a dwarf and cripple in religion all your days. Either in
   mortification, in denying the sinful pleasures of the senses, you will
   slight the fulness of joy at God's right hand for a little vain
   pleasure, which, when it is gone, it as is a thing of nought--(it is
   the pilgrim abstaineth from fleshly lusts--he that runneth not as
   uncertain, that keepeth down his body, 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27)--or in a way
   of self-denial, run few hazards for Christ. It may be they may make
   some petty losses, but do not sell all for the pearl of great price;
   or, in a way of charity. How else can you lend to the Lord upon his
   bond, or the security of his promise? Prov. xix. 17, He that hath pity
   on the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given will he
   pay him again.'

   (2.) Consider the profit. Whatever a believer loseth by the way, he is
   sure to have it at the end of his journey: Mat. xix. 28, Jesus said
   unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me in the
   regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory,
   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel.' You will be no losers by God at the last.

A WEDDING SERMON.

   And brought her unto the man.--Gen. II. 22.

   THE words belong to the story of the first marriage that ever was
   celebrated in the world, between the first man and the first woman; a
   marriage made by God himself in paradise, who, when he built the rib
   taken from Adam into a woman, from a builder becometh her bringer: He
   brought her unto the man, saith the text.

   God's bringing Eve to Adam implieth five things:--

   1. His permission, allowance, and grant; for that Adam might thankfully
   acknowledge the benefit as coming from God, God himself brought her;
   whether in a visible shape, as prefiguring Christ's incarnation, and
   with what ceremony he brought her--since the Holy Ghost hath not
   expressed it, I shall not now inquire; it is enough that God brought
   her to give her to him as his inseparable companion and meet-helper.
   This bringing was the full bestowing her upon him, that they should
   live together as man and wife.

   2. His institution and appointment of marriage as the means of
   propagating mankind. God's adduxit is, by our Saviour's interpretation,
   conjunxit: Mat. xix. 6, Those whom God hath joined together,' &c.
   Otherwise what need this bringing, for she was created just by him in
   paradise, when Adam was fallen into a deep sleep; not in another place;
   which showeth that marriage is an honourable estate. God was the first
   author of it; his act hath the force of an institution.

   3. For the greater solemnity and comely order of marriage. Adam did not
   take her of his own head, but God brought her to him. When we dispose
   of ourselves at our own wills and pleasures, being led there unto by
   our own choice, without consulting with God, or upon carnal reasons,
   without the conduct of God's providence, we transgress the order which
   God hath set in the first precedent of marriage, and cannot expect that
   our coming together should be comfortable. Much more doth it condemn
   the unnatural filthiness of whoredom, whereby men and women join and
   mingle themselves together without God, the devil and their inordinate
   lusts leading them. God would not put Adam and Eve together without
   some regard, as he did the brutish and unreasonable creatures; but doth
   solemnly, as it were, bring the manness by the hand to the man, and
   deliver her into his hands, having a more honourable regard and care of
   them. God cannot abide that brutish coming together as the horses do,
   neighing, in the rage of unbridled lusts, upon their mates, Jer. v. 8.
   No; Adam stayeth till she is brought to him. This honour and special
   favour God vouchsafeth mankind above all other creatures; he himself,
   in his own person, maketh the match, and bringeth them together.

   4. To dispense his blessing to them. The woman was created on the sixth
   day, as appeareth Gen. i.; and it is said that when he had created them
   male and female, he blessed them,' ver. 28. He doth enlarge things
   here, and explaineth what there he had touched briefly. When he had
   made the woman, he brought her to the man, and blessed them both
   together; showing thereby that when any enter into this estate, they
   should take God's blessing along with them, upon whose favour the
   comfort of this relation doth wholly depend. Those whom God bringeth
   into it are likely to fare best, and they that resign themselves up
   into his hands, to be disposed of by him, surely take the readiest way
   to obtain the happiness they expect.

   5. For a pattern of providence in all after-times. It is worth the
   observing, that Christ reasoning against polygamy, from ver. 24,
   compared with Mat. xix. God having abundance of the spirit, as the
   prophet speaks, Mal. ii. 15, brought the woman to one man, though there
   was more cause of giving Adam many wives for the speedier peopling of
   the world, than there could be to any of his posterity. As Christ
   observeth the number, so we may observe the thing itself. It is God's
   work still to give every one his marriage companion; he bringeth the
   woman to the husband, and every husband to his wife, that meet as they
   ought to do. His providence doth mightily and evidently govern all
   circumstances that concern this affair, as we shall show you by and by.

   The point which I shall insist on is this:--

   Doct. That marriages are then holily entered into, when the parties
   take one another out of God's hands.

   I. I will show you in what sense they are said to take one another out
   of God's hands.

   II. Why this is so necessary to be observed.

   I. For the first, they take one another out of God's hands two ways.

   1. When his directions are observed.

   2. When his providence is owned and acknowledged.

   1. When his directions in his word are observed; and so--

   [1.] As to the choice of parties. When a man seeketh out a help meet
   for himself, he should in the first place seek out a helpmeet for
   himself in the best things; for in all our deliberate and serious
   consultations, religion must have the first place: Mat. vi. 33, Seek ye
   first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof,' &c. A man's
   chief end should be discovered in all his actions, as it must guide me
   in my meat, and drink, and recreations, and the ordinary refreshments
   of the natural life, or else I do not act as a Christian. So much more
   in my most important and serious affairs, such as marriage is, and upon
   which my content and welfare so much dependeth. Certainly, he that
   would take God's blessing along with him, should make choice, in God's
   family, of one with whom he may converse as an heir with him of the
   grace of life. A Christian, saith the apostle, is at liberty to many,
   alla` monon en kurio, but only in the Lord,' 1 Cor. vii. 39; he is at
   liberty to rejoice, but in the Lord; to eat, and drink and trade, but
   in the Lord; so to marry, but in the Lord. Religion must appear
   uppermost in all his actions, and guide him throughout. The mischiefs
   that have come by a carnal choice should be sufficient warning to
   Christians: Gen. vi. 2, The sons of God went in unto the daughters of
   men, and took them wives, because they were fair.' They were swayed by
   carnal motives (or because rich, or nobly descended, it is all one),
   and what was the issue of it? There came of them a mongrel race of
   giants, that rose up against God and his interest in the world. Many
   times, by a carnal choice, all the good that is gotten into a family is
   eaten out, and within a little while religion is cast out of doors: Ps.
   cvi. 35, They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works;'
   Neh. xiii. 25, 26, I contended with them, and made them swear by God,
   Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their
   daughters to your sons;' 2 Kings viii. 18, He walked in the ways of the
   kings of Israel; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife.' Valens, the
   emperor, married with an Arian lady, and so was ensnared so far as to
   become a persecutor of the orthodox. The wife of the bosom hath great
   advantages, either to the perverting or the converting a man's heart to
   God; or else, if they should not prevail so far, what dissonancy and
   jarrings are there in a family when people are unequally yoked, the
   wife and husband drawing several ways!

   [2.] As to consent of parents. God here in the text, as the common
   parent, taketh himself to have the greatest hand in the bestowing of
   his own children. He brought her unto the man; and ordinary parents are
   his deputies, which must bring and give us in marriage, especially when
   young, and under their power. The scripture is express for this: Exod.
   xxii. 17, If her father wholly refuse to give her unto him,' &c.; 1
   Cor. vii. 38, He that giveth her in marriage,' &c.

   [3.] As to the manner of procuring it, that they labour to gain one
   another by warrantable, yea, religious ways, that we may lay the
   foundation of this relation in the fear of God; not by stealth, or
   carnal allurements, or violent importunities, or deceitful proposals,
   but by such ways and means as will become the gravity of religion; that
   weanedness and sobriety that should be in the hearts of believers; that
   deliberation which a business of such weight calls for; and that
   reverence of God, and justice that we owe to all; that seriousness of
   spirit, and that respect to the glory of God with which all such
   actions should be undertaken: Col. iii. 17, Whatsoever ye do, in word
   or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
   and the Father by him.' When this is observed, we are said to take one
   another out of God's hands.

   [4.] Especially clearing up our right and title by Christ. Meats,
   drinks, marriage, they are all sanctified by the word and prayer, and
   appointed to be received by thanksgiving of them that believe and
   receive the truth, 1 Tim. iv. 3-5. There is a twofold right--dominium
   politicum ct evangelicum; dominium politicum fundatur in providentiâ,
   evangelicum in gratiâ--political right is founded in God's providence,
   evangelical right in grace. We have a civil right to all that cometh to
   us by honest labour, lawful purchase, or inheritance, and fair and
   comely means used; which giveth us a right not only before men, but
   before God; not by virtue of their laws, but his grant. By a
   providential right, all wicked men possess all outward things, which
   they enjoy as the fruits and gifts of his common bounty, it is their
   portion, Ps. xvii. 14. Whatever falleth to their share in the course of
   God's providence, they are not usurpers merely for possessing what they
   have, but for abusing what they have. They have not only a civil right
   to prevent the encroachments of others by the laws of men, but a
   providential right before God, and are not simply responsible for the
   possession, but the use. But then there is an evangelical or
   new-covenant right. So believers have a right to their creature
   comforts by God's special conveyance, that sweeteneth every mercy, that
   it comes wrapt in the bowels of Christ. The little which the righteous
   hath is better than the treasures of many wicked;' as the mean fare of
   a poor subject is better than the dainties of a condemned traitor. And
   this we have by Christ, as the heir of all things, and we by him, 1
   Cor. iii. latter end. So all those things do belong to them that
   believe, as gifts of his fatherly love and goodness to us in Christ. As
   we take our bread out of Christ's hands, so we must be married to
   Christ before married to one another; the marriage covenant should be
   begun and concluded between Christ and you.

   [5.] For the end. The general and last end of this, as of every action,
   must be God's glory, 1 Cor. x. 31, and Col. iii. 17. A Christian's
   second-table duties and first-table duties should have on them.
   HOLINESS TO THE LORD. All the vessels of Jerusalem must have God's
   impress. More particularly our increase in godliness, and the
   propagation of the holy seed must be aimed at. Where one person is a
   believer, much more where both, they beget sons and daughters to God;
   but now are they holy,' 1 Cor. vii. 14. But those out of the church
   beget sons and daughters to men, merely to people the world. Seth's
   children are called sons of God,' Gen. vi. 1, 2. In the careful
   education of children, the church is upheld.

   2. When his providence is owned and acknowledged. It is the duty of
   them that fear God to own him upon all occasions, especially in such a
   business. Heathens would not begin such a business with out a
   sacrifice. There is a special providence about marriages. God claimeth
   the power of match-making to himself, more than he doth of ordering any
   other affairs of men: Prov. xix. 14, Riches and honours are an
   inheritance from our fathers; but a good wife is from the Lord.'
   Inheritances pass by the laws of men, though not without the
   intervention of God's providence, who determineth to every man the time
   of his service, and the bounds of his habitation, where every man shall
   live, and what he shall enjoy. The land of Canaan was divided by lot;
   but marriage is by the special destination of his providence, either
   for a punishment to men, or for a comfort and a blessing. Here
   providence is more immediate, by its influence upon the hearts of men;
   here providence is more strange and remarkable, in casting all
   circumstances and passages that did concern it. Estates fall to us by
   more easy and obvious means, and, therefore, though nothing be exempted
   from dominion of providence, yet a good wife is especially said to be
   of the Lord. So also Prov. xviii. 22, Whoso findeth a wife, findeth a
   good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.' A wife, that is a wife
   indeed--one that deserveth that name--he that findeth her, it is a
   chance to him, but an ordered thing by God. He hath not only experience
   of God's care, but his goodness and free grace to him in that
   particular. Well, then, God must be owned, sought, glorified, in this
   particular. The husband, in the catalogue and inventory of his mercies,
   must not forget to bless God for this, and the wife for the husband.
   The Lord was gracious in providing for me a good companion; I obtained
   favour from the Lord. God is concerned in this whole affair, he brought
   the woman to the man; he giveth the portion, which is not so much the
   dowry given by the parents, which is little worth, unless his blessing
   be added with it, as all the graces and abilities by which all married
   persons are made helpful one to another. He giveth the children, Ps.
   cxxvii. 3, Lo, children are an heritage from the Lord;' their
   conception and formation in the womb is from God. Parents know not
   whether it be male or female, beautiful or deformed. They know not the
   number of the bones, and veins, and arteries. He giveth them life; a
   sentence of death waylayeth them as soon as they come into the world.
   He giveth them comfort; there is a great deal of pride, and arrogancy,
   and self-willedness in all the sons and daughters of Adam, which makes
   them uncomfortable in their relations. A wife would soon prove a
   Jezebel, and not an Abigail, and a husband a Nabal, and not a David, by
   Satan's malice and our own corruption; a help would soon become a
   snare. They that would perform the duties of this relation need
   strongly to be sup ported with the assistance of God's Spirit. Finally,
   my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,'
   Eph. vi. 10. So that, since God giveth all, surely his providence must
   be owned and acknowledged; and you ought to say, this is the wife God
   hath chosen for me, and this is the husband God hath chosen for me.

   II. Why is this so necessary a duty? It doth in a great measure appear
   from what is said already. But farther--

   1. It will be a great engagement upon us to give God all the glory of
   the comfort we have in such a relation, when you do more sensibly and
   explicitly take one another out of God's hands. We are apt to look to
   second causes; he that sendeth the present is the giver, not he that
   bringeth it to us. The Romans were wont once a year to cast gar lands
   into their fountains, by that superstition owning the benefit they had
   by them. However, it hath a good moral to us in the bosom of it, that
   we should own the fountain of our blessings, and not ascribe them to
   our own wisdom and foresight, but the grace and favour of God, who, in
   the mere lottery and chance of human affairs, was pleased to choose so
   well for us. Jacob owned his fountain when he was become two bands,
   Gen. xxxii. 10. So should we; of him, through him, to him, do mutually
   infer one another. What we have from God, must be used for God. God is
   very jealous that we will not look to the original and first cause of
   our mercies: Hosea ii. 8, She did not know that I gave her corn, and
   wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold; and therefore will I
   return, and take away my corn, and wine, and oil, and flax,' &c. It is
   the way to lose our comforts, when we do not own and acknowledge God's
   hand in them. We are drowned in sense, inured and accustomed to second
   causes, so that God's hand is invisible and little regarded, we know it
   not, or heed it not. Now that we may look up and own the first cause,
   and give him his due honour, it is good to have explicit and actual
   thoughts in the receiving of our mercies, so as to take them out of
   God's hand; to draw aside the veil and covering of the creature, that
   you may remember the giver.

   2. That we may carry ourselves more holily in our relations, it is good
   to see God's hand in them. Every relation is a new talent wherewith God
   intrusteth us to trade for his glory; and to that end we must make
   conscience to use it. In Mat. xxv., the master delivered to every one
   his goods apart, and they that had the benefit received the charge. We
   are often pressed to do things, as in and to the Lord, upon religious
   and gracious reasons. It hath been the credit of religion, Dent tales
   mercatores, tales maritos, tales exactores fisci, &c.--Let history show
   such husbands, such wives, &c. The Christian religion maketh a man
   conscientiously careful and tender of his duty to man, not from a
   natural principle, or from our own ease, peace and credit, but from the
   conscience of our duty to God. Now it must not lose this credit by you.
   God puts us into relations to see how we will glorify him in them;
   there is something more required of you than as single Christians. God
   that puts a man into the ministry, requireth that he should honour him,
   not only as a Christian, but as a minister. And God that calleth a man
   into the magistracy, requireth that he should honour him as a
   magistrate. So to be a master of a family, and a wife or husband, there
   is another talent to be accounted for. An ambassador that is sent into
   a foreign country about special business, must give an account, not
   only as a traveller, but as an ambassador, of the business he was
   intrusted with. God will have honour by you as a wife, or as a husband;
   you have a new opportunity to make religion amiable, that the
   unbelieving world may see how profitable the heavenly life is to human
   society.

   3. That we may more patiently bear the crosses incident to this state
   of life if God call us to them. They that launch forth into the world,
   sail in a troublesome and tempestuous sea, and cannot expect but to
   meet with a storm before they come to the end of their voyage. The
   married life hath its comforts, and also its encumbrances and sorrows.
   Now it will sweeten all our crosses incident to this condition, when we
   remember we did not rashly enter into it by our own choice, but were
   led by the fair directure and fair invitation of God's providence; we
   need not much be troubled at what overtaketh us in the way of our duty,
   and the relations to which we are called. That hand that sent the
   trouble will sanctify it, or he will overrule things so that they shall
   work for our good. If God call us into this estate, he will support us
   in it. It is a great satisfaction to you that you are acting that part
   in the world which God would have you act; that you can say, I am there
   where God hath set me, and therefore will bear the troubles that attend
   that state and condition of life. If a man run on his own head, and
   inconveniences arise, they are more uncomfortably borne. It is true,
   that God doth fetch off his people from the afflictions they have
   brought upon themselves by their sin and folly, such is the indulgence
   of his grace; yet those sufferings are the more uncomfortable that take
   us out of the way of our duty; and God hath undertaken only to keep us
   in all our ways, but not out of our duty, Ps. xci. 11. The promises are
   not to foster men in their running after folly, but to encourage them
   in their several callings and state of life wherein God hath set them;
   there we may abide with comfort, and expectation either of God's
   blessing or his support. We tempt God when we venture upon a state of
   life which he hath not called us to, and have not his warrant; but when
   it is not good for us to be alone, and the Lord sends an helpmate for
   us, he will not forsake us.

   4. We may with the more confidence apply ourselves to God, and depend
   on him for a blessing upon a wife of God's choosing, or a husband of
   God's choosing. We have access to the throne of grace with more hope,
   because we have given up ourselves to his direction: Prov. iii. 6, In
   all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths,' God will
   order things for the best, when we do not lead, but follow him, we
   still consult with God, and dare not undertake anything but what is
   agreeable to his will. And will God mislead us and direct us amiss, or
   turn us into a by-way or crooked path? It is said, Ps. xxxvii. 23, 24,
   The steps of a good man, are ordered by the Lord, and he (that is the
   Lord) delighteth in his way; though he fall he shall not be utterly
   cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.' It is a blessed
   thing to be under God's conduct, to be led on or led off by so wise,
   and powerful, and all-sufficient a guide; for such he delights to do
   them good, and taketh pleasure in his resolutions to prosper them.
   Sometimes they shall have a taste of the evils of the world, but they
   shall not be ruined by them. They may fall, but they shall not be
   dashed in pieces; it is an allusion to a vessel that gets a knock, but
   is not broken by the fall.

   5. It is an help to make us more ready to part with one another when
   God willeth it. All temporal things, we receive them from God, upon
   this condition, to yield them up to God again, when he calls for them.
   The law concerning all created enjoyments is, The Lord giveth, the Lord
   taketh,' Job i. 21. We make a snare for ourselves, and receive them not
   in a right notion, if we do not receive them as mortal and perishing
   comforts, which God may demand at pleasure, and so keep the soul loose,
   and in a posture of submission, if God should cross us and disappoint
   us in them. Thus must we use all outward comforts with that weanedness
   and moderation as to children, estates, and all temporal blessings,
   &c., that will become a sense of the frailty that is in them, and the
   wheelings and turnings of an uncertain world. It is the apostle's
   direction: 1 Cor. vii. 29, The time is short, it remains that those
   that have wives be as though they had none;'--not as to be defective in
   our love to them and care over them; no, there is rather to be an
   excess than a defect here: Prov. v. 19, Be thou ravished always with
   her love;'--but as to a preparation of heart to keep or lose, if God
   should see fit, to be contented to part with a dear yoke-fellow, or at
   least with an humble submission and acquiescence, when God's will is
   declared; and some what of this must be mingled with all our
   rejoicings, some thoughts of the vanity of the creature. Leavened bread
   was to be eaten with the thank-offerings in the feast of tabernacles,
   when the barns were full. Man at his best estate is vanity,' Ps. xxxix.
   5. Now, to help us to do this, it is good to consider he that hath the
   right to give hath also the right of taking away; and as you must not
   be overjoyed with the receiving, so not be over-sad with parting.

APPLICATION.

   Use 1. Let us seek God by earnest prayer when any such matter is in
   hand. Marriages, we say, are made in heaven before they are made on
   earth. Pagans, before the awe of religion was extinguished, would begin
   with their gods in any weighty enterprise. A Jove principium was an
   honest principle among the heathens. Laban consults with his teraphim;
   Balak sendeth for Balaam to give him counsel; heathens had their
   sybils, and oracles at Delphos. So far as any nation was touched with a
   sense of a divine power, they would never venture upon any weighty
   thing without asking the leave or the blessing of what they supposed to
   be God. So for God's children, it was their constant practice; they
   durst not resolve upon any course till they had asked counsel of God.
   David always ran to the oracle of the ephod: Shall I go up to Hebron?'
   Jacob in his journey would neither go to Laban nor come from him
   without a warrant. Jehoshaphat, when the business of Ramoth Gilead was
   afoot, doth not lead forth the captains of the army but he sends for
   the prophets of the Lord: 1 Kings xxii. 4, 5, Inquire, I pray thee, of
   the word of the Lord this day.' So Judges i. 1, Who shall go up and
   fight against the Canaanites?' It is a contempt of God, and a kind of
   laying him aside, when we dare undertake anything without his leave,
   counsel, and blessing; and these are the things we are to seek in
   prayer.

   1. His leave. God is the absolute Lord of all things, both in heaven
   and earth, and whatsoever is possessed by any creature is by his
   indulgence. Whatever store and plenty we have by us, our Saviour
   teacheth us to beg our allowance, or leave to use so much as is
   necessary for us, or the portion of every day: Give us, se'meron, this
   day our daily bread.' It is a piece of religious manners to acknowledge
   God's right and sovereignty. It is robbery to make use of a man's
   goods, and to waste them and consume them, without his leave. All that
   we have or use is God's, who reserveth the property of all to himself.
   In distributing to the creatures, he never intended to divest himself
   of his right; as a husbandman, by sowing his corn in the field, is not
   dispossessed of a right to it. God hath dominium; we have
   dispensationem of life, and all the comforts that belong to it. Life is
   his; man is a custos, a guardian of it for God. Gold and silver is his;
   man is a steward to improve it for God. Adam had no interest in Eve
   till God brought her to him, and bestowed her on him. Every one of us
   must get a grant of God of all that he hath; the Lord he possesseth the
   house that we dwell in, the clothes we wear, the food we eat; and so,
   in the use of all other comforts, we must have a license from God, and
   take his leave. God is said to have given David the wives that he had
   into his bosom.

   2. His counsel and direction when the case is doubtful and our thoughts
   are uncertain: Prov. iii. 5, Lean not to thy own understanding.' We
   scarce know duties, certainly we cannot foresee events; therefore a man
   that maketh his bosom his oracle, his wit his counsellor, will choose a
   mischief to himself, instead of a comfort and a blessing. Therefore we
   ought chiefly, and first of all, to consult with God, and seek his
   direction, for he seeth the heart, and foreseeth events. We can only
   look upon what is present, and there upon the outward appearance.
   Therefore God can best direct us in our choice, he knoweth the fittest
   matches and consorts for every one; who hath a prospect of all things
   in one moment of time, and by one act of the understanding, and so can
   best dispose of human affairs for the profit and comfort of the
   creature: Jer. x. 23, O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in
   himself: nor is it in the sons of men to direct their steps;' that is,
   to order their affairs so as they may have felicity and comfort in
   them. So Prov. xx. 24, Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then
   understand his own way?' We cannot foresee the event of things, what is
   expedient, what not. Man would fain work out his happiness like a
   spider, climb up by a thread of his own spinning. But alas! all our
   devices and fine contrivances are gone with the turn of a besom. He
   that will be his own carver, seldom carveth out a good portion to
   himself. They intrench upon God's prerogative, and take the work out of
   his hands; and therefore no wonder if their wisdom be turned into
   folly.

   3. We ask his blessing. God doth not only foresee the event, but order
   it; by his wisdom he foreseeth it, and by his powerful providence he
   bringeth it to pass. Therefore God, that hath the disposal of all
   events, when our direction is over, is to be sought unto for a
   blessing; for every comfort cometh the sooner when it is sought in
   prayer; and whatever God's purposes be, that is our duty: Jer. xxix.
   11, 12, I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord,
   thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then
   shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will
   hearken unto you;' Ezek. xxxvi. 37, I will for this be inquired of by
   the house of Israel, to do it for them.' So in this case we read, John
   ii. 2, when there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, both Jesus was
   called and his disciples to the marriage.' Married persons do need, and
   therefore should seek, Christ's presence to their marriage, that he
   would vouchsafe his presence and countenance. Be sure to invite him,
   and take him along with you, that he may strengthen you by his grace,
   and dispose all providences about you for your comfort. He puts the
   greatest honour upon the marriage when he doth enable you to carry
   yourselves graciously in that relation, and to God's glory; and he hath
   the power of all providences put into his hand, as well as all grace.

   Use 2. Is advice to persons that are entering into this relation.

   1. Negatively. See that God be no loser by the marriage.

   2. Positively. Be sure that God be a gainer.

   These are the two proffers I have to make to you.

   1. Negatively. Let not God be a loser; he never intended to give you
   gifts to his own wrong.

   Now that will be:--

   [1.] If he be not the only one, and the lovely one of your souls. God
   must not have an image of jealousy set up; he must still be owned as
   the chiefest good. A wife is the delight of the eyes, but not the idol
   of the heart. Still you must be sure that his place be not invaded,
   that you may say, Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
   whom do I desire on earth in comparison of thee?' Carnal complacency
   must not weaken your delight in God; it is apt to do so. The excuse of
   one of those that was invited to the marriage-feast was, I have married
   a wife, and I cannot come,' Mat. xxii. Surely Christ would teach us
   thereby that this relation may become a snare, and encroach upon the
   prerogatives of God; he may be jostled out of the heart by the
   intrusion of some earthly comfort.

   [2.] If you be diverted from the earnest pursuit of heavenly things,
   either by carnal complacency or distracting cares and worldly
   encumbrances. There will be a time when we shall neither marry nor be
   given in marriage,' Luke xx. 35. And that is our happiest time; present
   contentments must not weaken the lively expectation of it, and steal
   away the heart into a mindlessness of it. Would God bring you to one
   another, think you, to turn off your thoughts and hopes for this
   blessed time when he shall be all in all? No; your comforts by the way
   in your pilgrimage must not hinder your delight in your comforts at
   home and in your country; this would be like a great heir in travel
   that should guzzle in an alehouse, and never think of returning to his
   inheritance.

   [3.] God would be a loser if you be less resolute in owning God's truth
   than you were before. Oh, take heed of daubing in religion! We must
   hate all for Christ, Luke xiv. 26. We must be as true still to make
   good our engagement to him. Wife and children must be undervalued for
   the gospel; we may be put to the trial whether we will cleave to them
   or Christ, who is our choice husband. The bond of religion is above all
   bonds; all bonds between husband and wife, father and children, end in
   death, but the bond of Christ is eternal: your children will not lose
   by your faithfulness to God.

   2. Positively. Let God be a gainer.

   [1.] By your daily praises, and blessing God for his providence, that
   hath brought you into this relation: I obtained favour from the Lord.'

   [2.] By living to God in this relation, performing the duties thereof
   so as your converse may be some lively resemblance of the communion
   between Christ and his church: Eph. v. 25-30, Husbands, love your
   wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
   that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the
   word; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
   spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and
   without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies:
   he that loveth his wife, loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his
   own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the
   church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
   bones.'

   [3.] By being mutual helps to one another in the best things, by the
   advancement of piety and godliness. The love of Christ doth not only
   enforce the husband's duty as an argument, but points forth the right
   manner of it as a pattern. Christ's love is sanctifying love: so should
   theirs be, such a love as showeth itself by sincere and real endeavours
   to bring about one another's spiritual and eternal good. Love one
   another, as heirs together of the grace of life,' 1 Peter iii. 7.

                                TWENTY SERMONS.
     __________________________________________________________________

PREFACE.

   IT may seem a just discouragement from publishing more sermons at this
   time, when there are such numbers abroad in the hands of all; for the
   abundance of things useful is fatal to their value, and the rareness
   exceedingly enhances their price. If men were truly wise, spiritual
   treasures should be excepted from this common law, yet plenty even of
   them causeth satiety. But the following sermons have that peculiar
   excellence that will make them very valuable to all that have
   discerning minds, and such a tincture of religion as makes them capable
   of tasting the goodness of divine things.

   I shall say nothing particularly here of the intellectual endowments of
   the author, in which he appeared eminent among the first, nor of his
   graces to adorn his memory; for a saint that is ascended into heaven,
   and crowned with eternal glory by the righteous Judge, needs not the
   weak, fading testimony of praise from men. Besides, that universal
   esteem he had from those who knew his ability, diligence, and fidelity
   in the work of God, makes it unnecessary for them who were his admirers
   and friends. And for those who are unacquainted with his worth, if they
   take a view of his works formerly printed, or the present sermons, that
   deserve equal approbation, they will have the same opinion with others.
   I will give some account of the sermons themselves.

   The main design of them is to represent the inseparable connection
   between Christian duties and privileges, wherein the essence of our
   religion consists. The gospel is not a naked, unconditionate offer of
   pardon and eternal life in favour of sinners, but upon most convenient
   terms, for the glory of God and the good of men, and enforced by the
   strongest obligations upon them to receive humbly and thankfully those
   benefits. The promises are attended with commands to repent, believe,
   and persevere in the uniform practice of obedience. The Son of God came
   into the world, not to make God less holy, but to make us holy, that we
   might please and enjoy him; not to vacate our duty, and free us from
   the law as the rule of obedience, for that is both impossible and would
   be most infamous and reproachful to our Saviour. To challenge such an
   exemption in point of right, is to make ourselves gods; to usurp it in
   point of fact is to make ourselves devils. But his end was to enable
   and induce us to return to God, as our rightful Lord and proper
   felicity, from whom we rebelliously and miserably fell by our
   disobedience, in seeking for happiness out of him. Accordingly the
   gospel is called the law of faith,' as it commands those duties upon
   the motives of eternal hopes and fears, and as it will justify or
   condemn men with respect to their obedience or disobedience, which is
   the proper character of a law. These things are managed in the
   following sermons in that convincing, persuasive manner as makes them
   very necessary for these times, when some that aspired to an
   extraordinary height in religion, and esteemed themselves the
   favourites of heaven, yet woefully neglected the duties of the lower
   hemisphere, as righteousness, truth, and honesty; and when carnal
   Christians are so numerous, that despise serious godliness as solemn
   hypocrisy, and live in an open violation of Christ's precepts, yet
   presume to be saved by him. Though no age has been more enlightened
   with the knowledge of holy truths, yet none was ever more averse from
   obeying them.

   I shall only add further, that they commend to our ardent affections
   and endeavours true holiness, as distinguished from the most refined
   unregenerate morality. The doctor saw the absolute necessity of this,
   and speaks with great jealousy of those who seem in their discourses to
   make it their highest aim to improve and cultivate some moral virtues,
   as justice, temperance, benignity, &c., by philosophic helps,
   representing them as becoming the dignity of the human nature, as
   agreeable to reason, as beneficial to societies, and but transiently
   speak of the supernatural operation of the Holy Spirit, that is as
   requisite to free the soul from the chains of sin as to release the
   body at the last day from the bands of death; that seldom preach of
   evangelical graces, faith in the Redeemer, love to God for his
   admirable mercy in our salvation, zeal for his glory, humility in
   ascribing all that we can return in grateful obedience to the most free
   and powerful grace of God in Christ, which are the vital principles of
   good works, and derive the noblest forms to all virtues. Indeed, men
   may be composed and considerate in their words and actions, may abstain
   from gross enormities, and do many praiseworthy actions by the rules of
   moral prudence; yet, without the infusion of divine grace to cleanse
   their stained natures, to renew them according to the image of God
   shining in the gospel, to act them from motives superior to all that
   moral wisdom propounds, all their virtues, of what elevation soever,
   though in a heroic degree, cannot make them real saints. As the plant
   animal has a faint resemblance of the sensitive life, but remains in
   the lower rank of vegetables, so these have a shadow, an appearance of
   the life of God, but continue in the corrupt state of nature. And the
   difference is greater between sanctifying saving graces wrought by the
   special power of the Spirit, with the holy operations flowing from
   them, and the virtuous habits and actions that are the effects of moral
   counsel and constancy, than between true pearls produced by the
   celestial beams of the sun, and counterfeit ones formed by the smoky
   heat of the fire. In short, the Lord Jesus, our Saviour and Judge, who
   purchased the heavenly glory, and has sole power to give the actual
   possession of it, assures us that unless a man be born of the Spirit,
   he can never enter into the kingdom of God.' The supernatural birth
   entitles to the supernatural inheritance. Without this, how fair and
   specious soever the conversation of men appears, they must expect no
   other privilege at last but a cooler place in hell; and the coolest
   there is intolerable.

SERMON I.

   Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
   Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
   whose spirit there is no guile--Ps. XXXII. 1, 2.

   THE title of this psalm is A psalm of instruction,' and so called be
   cause David was willing to show them the way to happiness from his own
   experience. Surely no lesson is so needful to be learned as this. We
   all would be happy: the good and bad, that do so seldom agree in
   anything, yet agree in this, a desire to be happy. Now, happy we cannot
   be but in God, who is the only, immutable, eternal, and all-sufficient
   good, which satisfies and fills up all the capacities and desires of
   our souls. And we are debarred from access to him by sin, which hath
   made a breach and separation between him and us, and till that be taken
   away there can be no converse, and sin can only be taken away by God's
   pardon upon Christ's satisfaction. God's pardon is clearly asserted in
   my text, but Christ's satisfaction and righteousness must be supplied
   out of other scriptures, as that 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ
   reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to
   them.' Where the apostle clearly shows that not imputing transgressions
   is the effect of God's grace in Christ. And we do no wrong to this text
   to take it in here; for the apostle, citing this scripture Rom. iv. 6,
   7, tells us, that David describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom
   the Lord imputeth righteousness without works, when he saith, Blessed
   are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered; blessed
   is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.'

   In the words you have:--

   1. An emphatical setting forth of a great and blessed privilege; that
   is, pardon of sin.

   2. A description of the persons who shall enjoy it: in whose spirit
   there is no guile.

   The privilege is that I shall confine my thoughts to; it is set forth
   in three expressions: forgiving transgression, covering of sin, and not
   imputing iniquity. The manner of speech is warm and vehement, and it is
   repeated over again: blessed is the man.

   I shall show what these three expressions import, and why the prophet
   doth use such vehemency and emphatical inculcation in setting forth
   this privilege.

   1. Whose transgression is forgiven, or who is eased of his
   transgression; where sin is compared to a burden too heavy for us to
   bear, as also it is in other scriptures: Mat. xi. 28, Come to me, all
   ye that are weary and heavy laden.'

   2. Whose sin is covered; alluding to the covering of filth, or the
   removing of that which is offensive out of sight. As the Israelites
   were to inarch with a paddle tied to their arms, that when they went to
   ease themselves they might dig, and cover that which came from them:
   Deut. xxiii., you have the law there, and the reason of it, ver. 14,
   For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp; therefore shall
   thy camp be holy, that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away
   from thee.'

   And then the third expression is, to whom the Lord imputeth no sin;
   that is, doth not put sin to their account. Where sin is compared to a
   debt, as it is also in the Lord's Prayer: Mat. vi. 12, Forgive us our
   debts, as we also forgive our debtors.' Thus is the act set forth.

   The object of pardon about which it is conversant is set forth under
   divers expressions--iniquity, transgression, and sin; as in law many
   words of like import and signification are heaped up and put together,
   to make the deed and legal instrument more comprehensive and effectual.
   I observe it the rather because, when God proclaims his name, the same
   words are used: Exod. xxxiv. 7, Taking away iniquity, transgression,
   and sin.' Well, we have seen the meaning of the expression. Why doth
   the holy man of God use such vigour and vehemency of
   inculcation--Blessed is the man,' and again Blessed is the man'? Partly
   with respect to his own case. David knew how sweet it was to have sin
   pardoned; he had felt the bitterness of sin in his own soul, to the
   drying up of his blood, and therefore he doth express his sense of
   pardon in the most lively terms--Blessed is the man whose iniquity is
   forgiven.' And then partly too with respect to those for whose use this
   instruction was written, that they might not look upon it as a light
   and trivial thing, but be thoroughly apprehensive of the worth of so
   great a privilege. Blessed, happy, thrice happy, they who have obtained
   pardon of their sins, and justification by Jesus Christ.

   The doctrine, then, which I shall insist upon is this: That it is a
   great degree and step towards, yea, a considerable part of our
   blessedness, to obtain the pardon of our sins by Christ Jesus. I shall
   evidence it to you by these three considerations:--

   1. I shall show what necessity lies upon us to seek after this pardon.

   2. Our misery without it.

   3. I shall speak of the annexed benefits, and our happiness if once we
   attain it.

   1. The necessity that lies upon us, being all guilty before God, to
   seek after our justification, and the pardon of our sins by Christ.
   That it may sink the deeper into your minds, I shall do it in this
   scheme or method:--First, A reasonable nature implies a conscience; a
   conscience implies a law; a law implies a sanction; a sanction implies
   a judge, and a judgment-day (when all shall be called to account for
   breaking the law); and this judgment-day infers a condemnation upon all
   man kind unavoidably, unless the Lord will compromise the matter, and
   find out some way in the chancery of the gospel wherein we may be
   relieved. This way God hath found out in Christ, and being brought
   about by such a mysterious contrivance, we ought to be deeply and
   thankfully apprehensive of it, and humbly and broken-heartedly to quit
   the one covenant, and accept of the grace provided for us in the other.

   [1.] A reasonable nature implies a conscience; for man can reflect upon
   his own actions, and hath that in him to acquit or condemn him
   accordingly as he doth good or evil, 1 John iii. 20, 21. Conscience is
   nothing but the judgment a man makes upon his actions morally
   considered, the good or the evil, the rectitude or obliquity, that is
   in them with respect to rewards or punishment. As a man acts, so he is
   a party; but as he reviews and censures his actions, so he is a judge.
   Let us take notice only of the condemning part, for that is proper to
   our case. After the fact, the force of conscience is usually felt more
   than before or in the fact; because before, through the treachery of
   the senses, and the revolt of the passions, the judgment of reason is
   not so clear. I say, our passions and affections raise clouds and mists
   which darken the mind, and do incline the will by a pleasing violence;
   but after the evil action is done, when the affection ceaseth, then
   guilt flasheth in the face of conscience. As Judas, whose heart lay
   asleep all the while he was going on in his villainy, but afterwards it
   fell upon him. Thou hast sinned in betraying innocent blood.' When the
   affections are satisfied, and give place to reason, that was before
   condemned, and reason takes the throne again, it hath the more force to
   affect us with grief and fear, whilst it strikes through the heart of a
   man with a sharp sentence of reproof for obeying appetite before
   reason. Now this conscience of sin may be choked and smothered for a
   while, but the flame will break forth, and our hidden fears are easily
   revived and awakened, except we get our pardon and discharge. A
   reasonable nature implies a conscience.

   [2.] A conscience implies a law, by which good and evil are
   distinguished; for if we make conscience of anything, it must be by
   virtue of some law or obligation from God, who is our maker and
   governor, and unto whom we are accountable, and whose authority giveth
   a force and warrant to the warnings and checks of conscience, without
   which they would be weak and ineffectual, and all the hopes and fears
   they stir up in us would be vain fancies and fond surmises. I need not
   insist upon this, a conscience implies a law. The heathens had a law,
   because they had a conscience: Rom. ii. 15, Which show the work of the
   law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and
   their thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another.'
   They have a conscience doth accuse or excuse, doth require according to
   the tenor of the law. So when the apostle speaks of those stings of
   conscience that are revived in us by the approach of death, he saith, 1
   Cor. xv. 56, The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the
   law.' Those stings which men feel in a death-threatening sickness, are
   not the fruits of their disease, but, justified by the highest reason;
   they come from a sense of sin y and this sense is strengthened and
   increased in us by the law of God, from whence conscience receives all
   its force.

   [3.] A law implies a sanction, or a confirmation by penalties and
   rewards; for otherwise it is but an arbitrary rule or direction, which
   we might slight or disregard without any great loss or danger. No; the
   law is armed with a dreadful curse against all those that disobey it.
   There is no dallying with God, he hath set life and death before us;
   life and good, death and evil, Deut. xxx. 15. Now the precept, that is
   the rule of our duty, and the sanction is the rule of God's process,
   what God will do, or might do, and what we have deserved should be done
   to us. The one shows what is due from us to God, and the other what may
   justly be expected at God's hands; therefore, before the penalty be
   executed, it concerns us to get a pardon. The scripture represents God
   as angry with the wicked every day,' standing continually with his bow
   ready, with his arrow upon the string, as ready to let fly, with his
   sword not only drawn but whetted, as if he were just about to strike,
   if we turn not, Ps. vii. 11-13.

   [4.] A sanction implies a judge, who will take cognisance of the
   keeping or breaking of this law; for otherwise the sanction or penalty
   were but a vain scarecrow, if there were no person to look after it.
   God, that is our maker and governor, is our judge. Would he appoint
   penalties for the breach of his law, and never reckon with us for our
   offences, is a thought so unreasonable, so much against the sense of
   conscience, against God's daily providence, against scripture, which
   everywhere (in order to this, to quicken us to seek forgiveness of
   sins) represents God as a judge. Conscience is afraid of an invisible
   judge, who will call us to account for what we have done. The apostle
   tells us, Rom. i. 32, the heathen knew the judgment of God, and that
   they that have done such things as they have done are worthy of death.'
   And providence shows us there is such a judge that looks after the
   keeping and breaking of his law, hath owned every part of it from
   heaven by the judgments he executes: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men;' hath owned either table, by punishing sometimes the ungodliness,
   and some times the unrighteousness of the world; nay, every notable
   breach by way of omission or commission. The apostle saith, every
   transgression,' and every disobedience.' These two words signify sins
   of omission or commission: it hath been punished, and God hath owned
   his law, that it is a firm authentic rule. And the scripture also
   usually makes use of this notion or argument of a judge to quicken us
   to look after the pardon of our sins: Acts x. 42, 43, And he hath
   commanded us to preach and testify to the people, that it is he that
   was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and dead. To him give
   all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in
   him shall receive remission of sins.' So Acts iii. 19-21. Surely we
   that are to appear before the bar of an impartial judge, being so
   obnoxious to him for the breach of his holy law, what have we to do but
   to make supplication to our judge, and prevent execution by a
   submissive asking of a pardon, and accepting the grace God hath
   provided?

   [5.] A judge implies a judgment-day, or some time when his justice must
   have a solemn trial, when he will reckon with the lapsed world. He
   reckons sometimes with nations now, for ungodliness and
   unrighteousness, by wars, and pestilence, and famine. He reckons with
   particular persons at their death, and when their work is done he pays
   them their wages: Heb. ix. 27, It is appointed for all men once to die,
   and after that the judgment.' But there is a more general and final
   judgment, when his justice must have a solemn trial, which is in part
   evident in nature; for the apostles did slide in the Christian doctrine
   mostly by this means into the hearts of those to whom they preached:
   Acts xxiv. 25, He reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
   to come.' The particularity of it belongs to the gospel revelation, but
   nature hath some kind of sense of it in itself, and they are urged to
   repent, because God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the
   world in righteousness, by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he
   hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
   dead,' Acts xvii. 31. God judgeth the world in patience now, but then
   in righteousness, when all things shall be reviewed, and everything
   restored; virtue to its public honour, and vice to its due shame.

   [6.] If there be a solemn judgment-day, when every one must receive his
   final doom, this judgment certainly infers a condemnation to a fallen
   creature, unless God set up another court for his relief; for now man
   is utterly disenabled by sin to fulfil the law, and can by no means
   avoid the punishment that is due to his transgression. I shall prove
   this by three reasons:--The law to fallen man is impossible; the
   penalty is intolerable; and the punishment, for aught that yet appears,
   if God do not take another course, is unavoidable.

   (1.) The duty of the law is impossible. The apostle tells us what the
   law could not do, in that it was weak through the weakness of our
   flesh.' It could not justify us before God, it could not furnish us
   with any answer to his demands, when he shall call us to an account.
   Man is mightily addicted to the legal covenant, therefore it is one
   part of a gospel minister's work to represent the impossibility of ever
   obtaining grace or life by that covenant. Man would stick to the law as
   long as he can, and will patch up a sorry righteousness of his own,
   some few superficial things. He makes a short exposition of the law,
   that he may cherish a large opinion of his own righteousness; and
   curtails the law of God, that the ell may be no longer than the cloth,
   and brings it down to a poor contemptible thing, requiring a few
   external superficial duties of men. We read often of being dead to
   sin,' and to the world;' it is as certainly true we must be dead to the
   law.' Now how are we dead to the law? The scripture tells us in one
   place, that through the law we are dead to the law;' and in another
   place, that we are dead to the law through the body of Christ.' The
   first place is Gal. ii. 19, Through the law I am dead to the law.' Men
   are apt to stand to the legal covenant, and have their confidence in
   the flesh, to place their hopes of acceptance with God in some few
   external things, which they make their false righteousness. For the
   carnal world, as it cries up a false happiness as its God, so men have
   a false righteousness which is their Christ. Now through the law they
   are dead to it. How? The law supposeth us as innocent, and requires us
   to continue so: Cursed is every one that continues not in every thing.'
   Suppose a man should exactly fulfil it afterwards, yet the paying of
   new debts will not quit old scores. And then we are dead to the law by
   the body of Christ,' Rom. vii. 4; by the crucified body of Christ, by
   which he hath merited and purchased a better hope and grace for us.
   Well, the duty is impossible.

   (2.) The penalty is intolerable, for who can stand when God is angry?
   Ezek. xxii. 14, Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong,
   in the day that I shall deal with thee?' We that cannot endure the pain
   of the gout or stone, how shall we endure the eternal wrath of God? It
   is surely a very dreadful thing to fall into the hands of that living
   God,' that lives for ever to punish the transgressors of his law.

   (3.) The punishment is unavoidable, unless sin be pardoned, and you
   submit to God's way: for I would ask you, what hope can you have in
   Go4, whose nature engageth him to hate sin, and whose justice obligeth
   him to punish it?

   (1st.) Whose nature engageth him to hate sin and sinners: Hab. i. 13,
   He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.' I urge this for a double
   reason: partly because I have observed that all the security of
   sinners, and their neglect of seeking after pardon by Jesus Christ, it
   comes from their lessening thoughts of God's holiness; and if their
   hearts were sufficiently possessed with an awe of God's unspotted
   purity and holiness, they would more look after the terms of grace God
   hath provided: Ps. l. 21, Thou thoughtest I was altogether such an one
   as thyself.' Why do men live securely in their sins, and do not break
   off their evil course? They think God is not so severe and harsh, and
   so .all their confidence is grounded upon a mistake of God's nature,
   and such a dreadful mistake as amounts to a blasphemy: Thou thoughtest
   I was altogether such an one as thyself.' The other reason is this,
   particularly because I observe the bottom reason of all the fear that
   is in the hearts of men is God's holiness: 1 Sam. vi. 20, Who is able
   to stand before this holy God?' and Who would not fear thee? for thou
   art holy,' Rev. xv. 4. We fear his power; why? because it is .set on
   work by his wrath. We fear his wrath; why? because it is kindled by his
   justice and righteousness. We fear his righteousness, because it is
   bottomed and grounded upon his holiness, and upon the purity of his
   nature.

   (2dly.) His justice obligeth him to punish sin, that the law might not
   seem to be made in vain. It concerns the universal judge to maintain
   the reputation of his justice in reference to men, and to appear to
   them still as a righteous God: Gen. xviii. 25, Shall not the judge of
   all the earth do right?' and Rom. iii. 5, 6, Is God unrighteous to take
   vengeance? how then shall he judge the world?' These scriptures imply,
   that if there were the least blemish, if you could suppose he should
   fail in point of righteousness, this were to be denied, that God should
   be the judge of the world. Therefore God's righteousness and justice,
   which gives to every one their due, must shine in its proper place; he
   will give vengeance to whom vengeance is due, and blessing to whom
   blessing belongs. In our case punishment belongs to us, and what can we
   expect from this God but wrath and eternal destruction? Therefore if
   all this be so, if a conscience suppose a law, a law a sanction, a
   sanction a judge--a judge some time when his justice must have a solemn
   trial, and this will necessarily infer condemnation to a fallen
   creature--what then shall we do?

   [7.] From this condemnation there is no escape, unless God set up
   another court and chancery of the gospel, where condemned sinners may
   be taken to mercy, and their sins forgiven, and they justified and
   accepted unto grace and life, Upon terms that may salve God's honour
   and government over mankind. There is a great deal of difference
   between the forgiving private wrongs and injuries, and the pardoning of
   public offences; between the pardon of a magistrate, and the pardon of
   a private person. When equals fall out among themselves, they may end
   their differences in charity, and in such ways as best please
   themselves, by a mere forgiving, by acquitting the sense of the wrong
   done, or a bare submission of the party offending. But the case is
   different here: God is not reconciled to us merely as the party
   offended, but as the governor of the world; the case lies between the
   judge of the world and sinning mankind; therefore it must not be ended
   by mere compromise and agreement, but by satisfaction, that his law may
   be satisfied, and the honour of his justice secured. Therefore to make
   the pardon of man a thing convenient to the righteous and holy judge to
   bestow, without any impeachment to the honour of his justice and
   authority of his law, the Lord finds out this great mystery, God
   manifested in our flesh,' Jesus Christ is made under the law, to redeem
   them that were under the law,' Gal. iv. 5; and is become a propitiation
   to satisfy God's justice,' Rom. iii. 25, 26. And so God shows mercy to
   his creatures, and yet the awe of his government is kept up, and a full
   demonstration of his righteousness is given to the world.

   [8.] This being done conveniently to God's honour, we must sue out our
   pardon with respect to both the covenants, both that which we have
   broken, the law of nature, and that which is made in Christ, and is to
   be accepted by us as our sanctuary and sure refuge.

   (1.) We must have a broken-hearted sense of sin, and of the curse due
   to the first covenant; for it is the disease brings us to the
   physician; the curse drives us to the promise, and the tribunal of
   justice to the throne of grace; and the avenger of blood at our heels,
   that causeth us to fly to our proper city of refuge, and to take
   sanctuary at the Lord's grace, Heb. vi. 18. So that if you mince and
   extenuate sin, you seem to hold to the first covenant, and had rather
   plead innocent than guilty. No; if you would have this favour, you must
   confess your sins: 1 John i. 9, If we confess our sins, he is faithful
   and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness.' You must confess your sins, and with that remorse
   that will become offences done to so great a God. And there must not
   only be a sense of sin, but of the curse and merit of sin also; for we
   must not only accuse, but judge ourselves, that God may not judge and
   condemn us, 1 Cor. xi. 31. Self-accusing respects sin, and is acted in
   confession; self-judging respects the curse or punishment that is due
   to us for sin, and it is a person's pronouncing upon himself according
   to the tenor of the law what is his due, acknowledging his guilt, and
   this with much brokenness of heart before God, when he hath involved
   himself in God's eternal wrath and displeasure. I observe, that the
   law-covenant is in the scripture compared to a prison, wherein God hath
   shut up guilty souls, Rom. xi. 32, He hath concluded or shut them up,
   that he may have mercy upon them;' Gal. iii. 21, He hath shut them up
   under sin.' The law is God's prison, and no offenders can get out of it
   till they have God's leave; and from him they have none, till they are
   sensible of the justice and righteousness of that first dispensation,
   confess their sins with brokenness of heart, and that it may be just
   with God to condemn them for ever.

   (2.) We must thankfully accept the Lord's grace, that offers pardon to
   us. For since God is pleased to try us a second time, and set us up
   with a new stock of grace, and that brought about in such a wonderful
   way, that he may recover the lost creation to himself, surely if we
   shall despise our remedy, after we have rendered ourselves incapable of
   our duty, no condemnation is bad enough for us, John iii. 18, 19.
   Therefore we should admire the mercy of God in Christ, and have such a
   deep sense of it, that it may check our sinful self-love, which hath
   been our bane and ruin. And since God showed himself willing to be
   reconciled, we must enter into his peace, not look upon ourselves in a
   hopeless and desperate condition, but depend upon the merit, sacrifice,
   and intercession of Christ, and be encouraged by his gracious promise
   and covenant to come with boldness, that we may find grace and mercy to
   help in a time of need,' Heb. iv. 16. Thus you see the need we have to
   look after this pardon of sin.

   2. Secondly, I must show our misery without this; and this will be best
   done by considering the notions here in the text. Here is filth to be
   covered, a burden of which we must be eased; and here is a debt that
   must be cancelled: and unless this be, what a miserable condition are
   we in!

   [1.] What a heavy burden is sin, where it is not pardoned! Carnal men
   feel it not for the present: elements are not burdensome in their own
   place; but how soon may they feel it! Two sorts of consciences feel the
   burden of sin--a tender conscience, and a wounded conscience. It is
   grievous to a tender heart, that values the love of God, to lie under
   the guilt of sin, and to be obnoxious to his wrath and displeasure: Ps.
   xxxviii. 4, Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as a burden too
   heavy for me.' Broken bones are sensible of the least weight; certainly
   a broken heart cannot make light of sin. What kind of hearts are those
   that sin securely, and without remorse, and are never troubled? Go to
   wounded consciences, and ask of them what sin is: Gen. iv. 13, Mine
   iniquity is greater than I can bear;' Prov. xviii. 14, A wounded
   spirit, who can bear?' As long as the evil lies without us, it is
   tolerable, the natural courage of a man may bear up under it; but when
   the spirit itself is wounded with the sense of sin, who can bear it? If
   a spark of God's wrath light upon the conscience, how soon do men
   become a burden to themselves; and some have chosen strangling rather
   than life. Ask Cain, ask Judas, what it is to feel the burden of sin.
   Sinners are all their lifetime subject to this bondage;' it is not
   always felt, but soon awakened: it may be done by a pressing
   exhortation at a sermon; it may be done by some notable misery that
   befalls us in the world; it may be done by a scandalous sin; it may be
   done by a grievous sickness, or worldly disappointment. All these
   things and many more may easily revive it in us. There needs not much
   ado to put a sinner in the stocks of conscience. Therefore do but
   consider to be eased of this burden; oh the blessedness of it!

   [2.] It is filth to be covered, which renders us odious in the sight of
   God. It is said, Prov. xiii. 5, that a sinner is loathsome.' To whom?
   To God. Certainly he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. To good
   men. The wicked is an abomination to the righteous;' the new nature
   hath an aversion to it. Lot's righteous soul was vexed from day to day
   with the conversation of the wicked. A wicked man hates a godly man
   with a hatred of enmity and abomination; but a godly man doth not hate
   a wicked man with a hatred of enmity--that is opposite to
   good-will--but with that of abomination, which is opposite to
   complacence. It is loathsome to an indifferent man, for holiness darts
   an awe and reverence into the conscience. The righteous is more
   excellent than his neighbour,' and a wicked person is a vile person in
   the common esteem of the world: horrible profaneness will not easily
   down. Nay, it is loath some to other wicked men. I do not know whether
   I expound that scripture rightly, but it looks somewhat so, Hateful and
   hating one another.' We hate sin in another, though we will not take
   notice of it in ourselves. The sensuality and pride and vanity of one
   wicked man is hated by another; nay, he is loathsome to himself. Why?
   because he cannot endure to look into himself. We cannot endure
   ourselves when we are serious. They will not come to the light, lest
   their deeds should be reproved.' And we are shy of God's presence; we
   are sensible we have something makes us offensive to him, and we hang
   off from him when we have sinned against him; as it was David's
   experience, Ps. xxxii. 3. That was the cause of his silence: he kept
   off from God, having sinned against him, and had not a heart to go home
   and sue out his pardon. Oh, what a mercy is it, then, to have this
   filth covered, that we may be freed from this bashful inconfidence, and
   not be ashamed to look God in the face, and may come with a holy
   boldness into the presence of the blessed God! Oh, the blessedness of
   the man whose sin is covered!

   [3.] It is a debt that binds the soul to everlasting punishment; and if
   it be not pardoned, the judge will give us over to the jailer, and the
   jailer cast us into prison, till we have paid the uttermost farthing,'
   Luke xii. 59. To have so vast a debt lying upon us, what a misery is
   that! Augustus bought that man's bed who could sleep soundly when he
   was in debt so many hundred of sesterces. Certainly it is a strange
   security that possesseth the hearts of men, when we are obliged to
   suffer the vengeance of the wrath of the eternal God by our many sins,
   and yet can sleep quietly. Body and soul will be taken away in
   execution; the day of payment is set, and may come much sooner than you
   think for; you must get a discharge, or else you are undone for ever.
   Our debt comes to millions of millions; well, if the Lord will forgive
   so great a debt, oh, the blessedness of that man. Put altogether now;
   certainly if you have ever been in bondage, if you have felt the sting
   of death and curse of the law, or been scorched by the wrath of God, or
   knew the horror of those upon whom God hath exacted this debt in hell,
   certainly you would be more and more affected with this wonderful
   grace. Oh, the blessedness of the man to whom the Lord imputeth not his
   transgressions!'

   Thirdly, The consequent benefits. I will name three:--

   [1.] It restores the creature to God, and puts us in joint again, in a
   capacity to serve, and please, and glorify God: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is
   forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.' Forgiveness invites
   us to return to God, obliges us to return to God, and take it as God
   dispenseth it; it inclines us to return to God, and encourages us to
   live in a state of amity and holy friendship with God, pleasing and
   serving him in righteousness and holiness all our days. Certainly it
   invites us to return to God. Man stands aloof from a condemning God,
   but may be induced to submit to a pardoning God. And it obligeth us to
   return to God, to serve, and love, and please him who will forgive so
   great a debt, and discharge us from all our sins; for she loved much to
   whom much was forgiven. It inclines us to serve and please God; for
   where God pardons he renews, he puts a new life into us that inclines
   us to God: Col. ii. 13, He hath quickened you together with Christ,
   having forgiven all your trespasses.' And it encourages us to serve and
   please God: Heb. ix. 14, How much more shall the blood of Christ
   cleanse your consciences from dead works, that ye may serve the living
   God?' and that in a suitable manner, that you may serve God in a
   lively, cheerful manner. A poor creature bound to his law, and
   conscious of his own disobedience, and obnoxious to wrath and
   punishment, is mightily clogged, and drives on heavily; but when the
   conscience is purged from dead works, we serve the living God in a
   lively manner; and this begets a holy cheerfulness in the soul, and we
   are freed from that bondage that otherwise would clog us in our duty to
   God.

   [2.] It lays the foundation for solid comfort and peace in our own
   souls, for till sin be pardoned you have no true comfort; because the
   justice of the supreme governor of the world will still be dreadful to
   us, whose laws we have broken, whose wrath we have justly deserved, and
   whom we still apprehend as offended with us, and provoked by us. We may
   lull the soul asleep with carnal delights, but the virtue of that opium
   will be soon spent. All those joys are but stolen waters, and bread
   eaten in secret, a poor, sorry peace, that dares not come to the light
   and endure the trial,--a sorry peace, that is soon disturbed by a few
   serious and sober thoughts of God and the world to come; but when once
   sin is pardoned, then you have true joy indeed' Be of good cheer, thy
   sins be forgiven thee,' Mat. ix. 2. Then misery is plucked up by the
   roots: Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people.' Why? Her iniquity is
   forgiven,' Isa. xl. 1, 2; And we joy in God as those that have received
   the atonement,' Rom. v. 11. The Lord Jesus hath made the atonement; but
   when we have received the atonement, then we joy in God, then there is
   matter for abundant delight, when the love of God is shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.'

   [3.] When we are pardoned, then we are capable of eternal happiness.
   Pardon of sin is gratia removens prohibens, that grace that removes the
   impediment, that takes the make-bate out of the way, removes that that
   hinders our entrance into heaven. Sanctification is the beginning; but
   till we are pardoned, there can be no entrance into heaven: now this
   removes the incapacity. I observe remission of sins is but for all the
   privilege part, as repentance for the duties: Acts v. 31, Him hath God
   exalted to give repentance and remission of sins.' There are two
   initial benefits--repentance, as the foundation of the new life; and
   remission of sins, as the foundation of all our future mercies. There
   are two chief blessings offered in the new covenant, pardon and life,
   reconciliation with God, and the everlasting fruition of him in glory;
   and the one makes way for the other: Acts xxvi. 18, To open their eyes,
   and to turn them from Satan to God, that they may receive remission of
   sins, and an inheritance among the saints.' When we are pardoned, then
   we are capable to look for the blessed inheritance; the impediment is
   taken out of the way that excludes from it.

   And thus you see the blessedness of the man whose transgression is
   forgiven, whose filth is covered, and unto whom the Lord will not
   impute his sin.'

A WORD OF APPLICATION.

   1. Let us bless God for the Christian religion, where this privilege is
   discovered to us in all its glory, and that upon very commodious terms,
   fit to gain the heart of man, and to reduce him to God: Micah vii. 18,
   Who is a God like unto thee among all the gods, pardoning the
   transgressions of thine heritage?' The business of religion is to
   provide sufficiently for two things, which have much troubled the
   considering part of the world;--a suitable happiness for mankind, and
   suitable means for the expiation of sin. Happiness is our great desire,
   and sin is our great burden and trouble. Now these are fully made known
   and discovered to us by the Christian faith. The last is that we are
   upon,--the way how the grand scruple of the world may be satisfied, and
   their guilty fears appeased; and that we may see the excellency of the
   Christian religion above all religions in the world, it offers pardon
   upon such terms as are most commodious to the honour of God, and most
   satisfactory to our souls; that is, upon the account of Christ's
   satisfaction and our own repentance, without which our case is not
   compassionable. The first I will chiefly insist on. The heathens were
   mightily perplexed about the way how God could dispense with the honour
   of his justice in the pardon of sin. That man is God's creature, and
   therefore his subject; that he hath exceedingly failed and faulted in
   his duty and subjection to him, and is therefore obnoxious to God's
   just wrath and vengeance, are truths evident in the light of nature and
   common experience; and therefore the heathens had some convictions of
   this, and saw a need that God should be atoned and propitiated by some
   sacrifices of expiation; and the nearer they lived to the original of
   this tradition and institution, the more burdened and pressing were
   their conceits and apprehensions thereof. But in all their cruel
   superstitions there was no rest of soul; they knew not the true God,
   nor the proper ransom, nor had any sure way to convey pardon to them,
   but were still left to the puzzle and distraction of their own
   thoughts, and could not make God merciful without some diminution of
   his holiness and justice, nor make him just without some diminution of
   his mercy. Somewhat they conceived of the goodness of God by his
   continuing forfeited benefits so long: God left them not without a
   witness;' but yet they could not reconcile it to his justice or will to
   punish sinners; and all their apprehensions of the pardon of sin were
   but probabilities, and what was wrought to procure merit was
   ridiculous, or else barbarous and unnatural, giving their first-born
   for the sin of their soul,' Micah vi. 7. And all those notions they had
   about this apprehended expiation were too weak to change the heart or
   life of man, or to reduce him to God. Come we now to the Jews. The Jews
   had many sacrifices of God's own institution, but such as did not make
   the comers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,' Heb.
   ix. 9; and the ransom that was to be given to provoked justice was
   known but to a few. They saw much of the patience and forbearance of
   God, but little of the righteousness of God, and which was the great
   propitiation. Till God set forth Jesus Christ to be a propitiation,
   through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
   remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God; to
   declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness, that he might be just,
   and the justifier of him that believes in Jesus,' Rom. iii. 25, 26.
   Their ordinances and sacrifices were rather a bond acknowledging the
   debt, or pre-signifying the ransom that was to be paid, and their
   sacrifices did rather breed bondage; and their ordinances were called
   an handwriting of ordinances that were against them.' The redemption of
   souls was then spoken of as a great mystery, but sparingly revealed:
   Ps. xlix. 3, 4, My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and the meditation of
   my heart shall be of understanding. I will incline mine ear to a
   parable, I will open my dark sayings upon the harp.' What was that
   wisdom? What was that dark saying? The redemption of souls is precious;
   it ceaseth for ever.' As it lies upon mere man's hand, none can give a
   ransom for his brother.' Eternal redemption by Christ was a dark saying
   in those days, only they knew no mere man could do it. And in more
   early times, in Job's time, he was an interpreter, one of a thousand,'
   that could bring this message to a distressed sinner, that God had
   found out a ransom. This atonement, then, that lies at the bottom of
   pardon of sin, was a rare thing in those days. Let us bless God for the
   clear and open discovery of this truth, and free offer of grace by
   Jesus Christ.

   The second use is to quicken us to put in for a share in this blessed
   privilege. I have spent my time in presenting to you what a blessed
   thing it is to have our sins pardoned. Christians, a man that flows in
   wealth and honour, till he be pardoned, is not a happy man. A man that
   lives afflicted, contemned, not taken notice of in the world, if he be
   a pardoned sinner, oh, the blessedness of that man! They are not happy
   that have least trouble, but they that have least cause; not they that
   have a benumbed conscience, but they that have a conscience sound,
   established, and settled in the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord, and bottomed upon his holy covenant, and that peace and grace he
   offers to us; this is the happy man. By these and such like arguments I
   would have you put in for a share of this privilege. But what must be
   required? I would fain send you away with some directions.

   Let me entreat you, if this be such a blessed thing, to make it your
   daily, your earnest, your hearty prayer to God, that your sins may be
   pardoned, Mat. vi. 12. Our Lord hath taught us to pray (for we make but
   too much work for pardoning mercy every day), Every day forgive us our
   trespasses.' To-day, in one of the petitions, is common to all that
   follow; as we beg daily bread, we must beg daily pardon, daily grace
   against temptations, tinder the law, they had a lamb every morning and
   every evening offered to God for a daily sacrifice, Num. xxviii. 4-6.
   We are all invited to look to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the
   sins of the world. Surely we have as much need as they more cause than
   they; because now all is clear, and openly made known unto us. God came
   to Adam in the cool of the day; he would not let him sleep in his sins:
   before night came, he comes and rouseth his conscience, and then gives
   out the promise of the seed of the woman that should break the
   serpent's head. In reconciliation with God, let not the sun go down
   upon God's wrath, Eph. iv. 26. A man should not sleep in his anger, nor
   out of charity with man; surely we should make our peace with God every
   day. If a man, under the law, had contracted any uncleanness, he was to
   wash his clothes before evening, that he might not lie a night in his
   uncleanness. We should daily earnestly come to God with this request,
   Lord, pardon our sins. But what! must those that are already adopted
   into God's family, and taken into his grace and favour, daily pray for
   pardon of sin? Though upon our first faith our state be changed, and we
   are indeed made children of God, and heirs of eternal life by faith in
   Christ Jesus; yet he that is clean, need wash his feet. We contract a
   great deal of sinful defilement and pollution by walking up and down
   here in a dirty world; and we must 1 every day be cleansing our
   consciences before God, and begging that we may be made partakers of
   this benefit. The Lord may, for our unthankfulness, our negligence, our
   stupid security, revive the memory of old sins, and make us look into
   the debt-book (that hath been cancelled) with horror, and make us
   possess the sins of our youth.' An old bruise is felt upon every change
   of weather. When we prove unthankful, and careless, and stupid, and
   negligent, and do not keep our watch, the Lord may suffer these things
   to return upon our consciences with great amazement. Guilt raked out of
   its grave is more frightful than a ghost, or one risen from the dead.
   Few believers have, upon right terms, the assurance of their own
   sincerity; and though God may blot sins out of the book of his
   remembrance, yet he will not blot them out of our consciences. The worm
   of conscience is killed still by the application of the blood of Christ
   and the Spirit. This short exhortation I would give you, the other
   would take up too much time.

SERMON II.

   Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
   Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
   whose spirit there is no guile.--Ps. XXXII. 1, 2.

   IN this text I observed, that it is a great degree and step towards,
   yea, a considerable part of our blessedness, to obtain pardon of our
   sins upon the account of Christ's righteousness. I showed the necessity
   which lies upon men, who are all become guilty before God, to look
   after this pardon; and thereupon took occasion to represent the
   excellency of the Christian religion, that hath provided a salve for
   the great sore that runs upon all mankind, above that of the pagans,
   and also that of the Jews, to whom this mystery was but darkly
   revealed. To proceed to another use, to exhort you to put in for a
   share in this blessedness, to persuade you to it, let me use a few
   motives.

   1. Till you are pardoned you are never blessed; there is an obstacle
   and impediment in the way hinders your blessedness. What though you
   flow in wealth, ease, and plenty; yet as long as this black storm hangs
   over your head, and you know not how soon it will drop upon you, you
   cannot be accounted happy men. Do you account him a happy man who is
   condemned to die, because he hath a plentiful allowance till his
   execution? or him a happy man that makes a fair show abroad, and puts a
   good face upon his ruinous and breaking condition, but at home is
   pinched with want and misery, which is ready to come upon him like an
   armed man? or him a happy man that revels it out in all manner of
   pleasure, but is to die at night? Then those that remain in the guilt
   of their sins may be happy. But now, on the other side, a pardoned
   sinner is blessed whatever befalls him. If he be afflicted, the sting
   of his affliction is gone, that is sin; if he be prosperous, the curse
   of his blessings is taken away; the wrath of God is appeased, and so
   every condition is made tolerable or comfortable to him.

   2. Nothing less than a pardon will serve the turn. Not forbearance on
   God's side, nor forgetfulness on ours.

   [1.] It is not a forbearance of the punishment on God's part, but a
   dissolving the obligation to the punishment. God may be angry with us
   when he doth not actually strike us: as the psalmist says, Ps. vii.
   11-13, God is angry with the wicked every day. If he turn not, he will
   whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. He hath also
   prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows
   against the persecutors.' In the day of his patience he doth for a
   while spare; but God is ready to deal with them hand to hand, for he is
   sharpening his sword at a distance; he is bending his bow: the arrow is
   upon the string, and how soon God may let it fly we cannot tell;
   therefore we are never safe till we turn to God, and enter into his
   peace. Wherever there is sin there is guilt, and wherever there is
   guilt there will be punishment. If we dance about the brink of hell,
   and go merrily to execution, it argues not our sin, [15] but stupidity
   and folly.

   [2.] On our part, our senseless forgetfulness will do us no good.
   Carnal men mind not the happiness of an immortal soul, and they are not
   troubled because they consider not their condition; but they are not
   happy that feel least trouble, but those that have least cause. A
   benumbed conscience cannot challenge this blessedness; they only put
   off that which they cannot put away, which God hath neither for given
   nor covered. They do but skin the wound till it fester and rankle into
   a dangerous sore. God is the wronged party, and supreme judge, to whose
   sentence we must stand or fall. If he justifies, then who will condemn?
   We may lay ourselves asleep, and sing peace to ourselves; but it is not
   what we say, but what God saith: There is no peace, saith my God, to
   the wicked.'

   3. A pardon is surely a great blessing, if we consider, first, the
   evils we are freed from; and, secondly, the good depending upon it.

   [1.] The evils we are freed from. Guilt is the obligation to
   punishment, and pardon is the dissolving or loosing that obligation.
   Now, the punishment is exceeding great, no less than hell and
   damnation; and hell is no vain scarecrow, nor is heaven a May-game.
   Eternity makes everything truly great. Look at the loss--an eternal
   separation from the comfortable presence of God: Mat. xxv. 41, Go, ye
   cursed,' &c.; and Luke xiii. 27, Depart, ye workers of iniquity.' When
   God turned Adam out of paradise, his case was very sad, but God took
   care of him, made him coats of skins to clothe him, gave him a day of
   patience, afterwards promised the seed of the woman, who should recover
   the lapsed state of mankind, and so intimated hopes of a better
   paradise. That exile, therefore, is nothing comparable to this; for now
   man is stript of all his comfort, sent into an endless state of misery,
   where there shall be no hope of ever changing his condition. Now, to be
   delivered from this that is so great an evil, what a blessedness is it!
   For the poena sensus, the pain as well as the loss, our Lord sets it
   forth by two notions: Mark ix. 44, The worm that never dies, and the
   fire that shall never be quenched.' The scripture speaks of the soul
   with allusion to the state of the body after death. In the body worms
   breed usually, and many times they were burnt with fire. Accordingly,
   our state in the world to come is set forth by a worm and a fire. The
   worm implies the worm of conscience--a reflection upon our past folly
   and disobedience to God, and the remembrance of all the affronts we
   have put upon Christ. Here men may run from the rebukes of conscience
   by many shifts, sports, distracting their minds with a clatter of
   business; but then there is not a thought free, but the damned are
   always thinking of slighted means, abused comforts, wasted time, the
   offences done to a merciful God, and the curse wherein they have
   involved themselves by their own folly. The fire that shall never be
   quenched notes the wrath of God, or those unknown pains that shall be
   inflicted upon the body and soul; which must needs be great, because
   God himself will take the sinful creature into his own hands to punish
   him, and will show forth the glory of his wrath and power upon him.
   When God punisheth us by a creature, the creature is not a vessel
   capacious enough to convey the power of his wrath; as when a giant
   strikes with a straw, that cannot convey his strength. But when God
   falls upon us himself, It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
   the living God.' How dreadful is that! Is it not a blessedness to be
   freed from so great an evil? Then a little mitigation, a drop to cool
   your tongue, would be accounted a great mercy.

   [2.] If we consider the good depending on it. You are not capable of
   enjoying God, and being happy for evermore, till his wrath be appeased,
   and your sins forgiven; but when that is once done, then you may have
   sure hope of being admitted into his presence: Rom. v. 10, If, when we
   were enemies, we were reconciled by his death, much more being now
   reconciled shall we be saved by his life;' that is to say, it is far
   more credible that a reconciled man should be glorified, than that a
   sinner and rebel should be reconciled. If you can pass over this
   difficulty, and once get into God's peace, then what may you not expect
   from God? The first favour to such as have been rebels against him
   facilitates the belief of all acts of grace.

   Now, what must we do that we may be capable of this blessed privilege,
   that our sins may be pardoned, and our filth covered, and our debt may
   be forgiven? I shall give my answer in three branches:--

   I. I will show you what is to be done as to your first entrance into
   the evangelic state.

   II. What is to be done as to your continuance therein, and that you may
   still enjoy this privilege; and--

   III. What is to be done as to your recovery out of grievous lapses, and
   falls, and wounds, as are more troublesome to the conscience, for which
   a particular and express repentance is required.

   I. As to our first entrance into the evangelic state; that is by faith
   and repentance: both are necessary to pardon, Acts x. 43, To him give
   all the prophets witness, that through his name, whosoever believeth in
   him shall receive remission of sins.' There remission of sins is
   granted to a believer. Now repentance is full out as necessary, Acts
   ii. 38, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
   Christ, for the remission of sins;' Luke xxiv. 47, And that repentance
   and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,
   beginning at Jerusalem.' What is in another evangelist, to preach the
   gospel to every creature,' in this is, that repentance and remission of
   sins should be preached in his name.' And this is preaching the gospel;
   for the gospel is nothing else but a doctrine of repentance and
   remission of sins. So if we will not hearken to the vain fancies of men
   who have perverted the scripture, but stand to the plain gospel of our
   Lord Jesus Christ; these two duties are necessary to pardon. Christ's
   satisfaction is not imputed to us, but upon terms agreed on in the
   covenant of redemption. As to the impetration there is required the
   intervention of Christ's merit, so to the application faith and
   repentance, without which we are not pardoned. These two graces have a
   distinct reference, and it is intimated by that passage of Paul, for he
   gives this account of his ministry, Acts xx. 21, Testifying both to the
   Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards
   our Lord Jesus Christ.' Here, in short, repentance respects God, to
   whom we return, and faith Jesus Christ, by whom we return. From God we
   fell, to God we must return; we fell from him as we withdrew our
   allegiance, and sought our happiness elsewhere; and we return to him as
   our rightful Lord and our proper happiness. And then faith in Christ is
   necessary, because the Lord Jesus is the only remedy for our misery,
   who opened the way to God by his merit and satisfaction, and doth also
   bring us to walk in his ways by his renewing first, and then
   reconciling grace; and faith is that that respects him. Who will take
   physic of a physician whose art he does not trust, or go to sea with a
   pilot whose skill he questions? Who will venture his eternal interest
   in Christ's hands, if he be not persuaded of his ability and fidelity,
   as one that is able to make our peace with God, and bring us to the
   enjoyment of him? But I would not lightly mention it, but bring it to a
   distinct issue.

   1. I will show you it is for the glory of God and comfort of the
   creature that there should be a stated course of entering into God's
   peace, or applying the gospel; for we must not so look to the
   impetration, or merit and righteousness of Christ, as not to consider
   the application, and how we come to have a title to these things.

   2. I will show that these two graces and duties are faith and
   repentance, which do in many things agree, and in other respects
   differ.

   3. I will show you that they, differing in their use, are required for
   distinct reasons and ends.

   4. The use of these graces will plainly discover their nature to you,
   so that a poor Christian, that would settle his soul upon Christ's
   terms, and this blessed gospel made known to us, need not any longer
   debate what is repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   1. It is for the glory of God and the comfort of the creature that
   there should be a stated course of applying the privileges of the
   gospel, or of entering into God's peace.

   [1.] It is certainly for the glory of God. It is not meet that pardon
   and life should be prostituted to every one that will hastily challenge
   these privileges. Pardon we are upon; our case is not compassionable
   till we relent and submit to God's terms. I would appeal to your own
   consciences: surely it is more suitable to the wisdom of God that a
   penitent sinner should have pardon rather than an impenitent, or one
   that securely continues in his sins, and despiseth both the curse of
   the law and the grace of the gospel. It is not agreeable to the honour
   of God, and the wisdom of his trans actions with man, that such should
   have benefit by him. Again, for faith: it is not meet we should have
   benefit by one we know not and trust not. Whatever be God's mercy to
   infants, who are not in a capacity to know and trust him, yet, in adult
   and grown persons, it is necessary we should not have such great
   privileges settled upon us without our knowledge, or besides and
   against our wills. God will have our consent in a humble and solemn
   way, that we may come and thankfully accept what he hath provided for
   us. So this is very much for the glory of God.

   [2.] And then for our comfort, that we may make our claim, that we may
   state our interest with the greater certainty and assurance; for when
   great privileges are conditionally propounded, as they are in the new
   covenant, our right is suspended till the conditions be performed; and
   certainly our comfort is suspended till we know they be performed, till
   we know ourselves to be such as have an interest in the promises of the
   gospel. I have told you, Blessed are they whose sins are pardoned. But,
   saith the soul, if I knew my sins were pardoned I should think myself a
   blessed creature indeed. What would you reply to this anxious and
   serious soul? God hath made a promise, an offer of pardon by Christ:
   the offer of pardon is the invitation to use the means that we may be
   possessed of it. But then the serious anxious soul replies still, To
   whom is this promise made? How shall I come to know that I am thus
   blessed and accepted by God, and that my sins are pardoned? What is to
   be replied here? Look to whom the promise is made. Certainly it is made
   to some, or to all. If you say the promise is to all, you deceive the
   most; if to some, you must say, from scripture, to them that repent and
   believe--to the penitent believer. Here is the shortest way to bring
   the debate to an issue, wherein our comfort is so much concerned, to
   see we be penitent believers. For thus the application is stated, and
   the fixing these conditions is the more for the glory of God, and the
   comfort of the creature.

   2. The two graces or duties upon which it is fixed faith and
   repentance--do in many things agree, in other respects differ.

   [1.] They both agree in this, that they are both necessary to the
   fallen creature, and do concern our recovery to God, and so are proper
   to the gospel, which is provided for the restoration of lapsed man
   kind. The gospel is a healing remedy, and therefore is Christ so often
   set forth by the term of a physician. The law was a stranger to both
   these duties; it knew no such thing as repentance and faith in Christ;
   for, according to the tenor of it, once a sinner, and for ever
   miserable. But the gospel is a plank cast out after shipwreck, whereby
   we may escape and come safe to shore.

   Again, they both agree in this, that they concern our entrance and
   first recovery out of the defection and apostasy of mankind, for after
   wards there are other things required; but as to our first entrance
   into the evangelic state, both these graces are required, and the acts
   of them so interwoven, that we can hardly distinguish them.

   Again, they both agree in this, that they have a continual influence
   upon our whole new obedience. For the secondary conditions of the
   covenant do grow out of the first, and these two graces run throughout
   our whole life. Repentance, mortifying sin, is not a work of a day, but
   of our whole lives, and the like is faith.

   Again, they agree in that both are effected and wrought in us by the
   Holy Spirit; that God, who requires these things, gives them.

   Lastly, they agree in this, that the one cannot be without the other,
   neither repentance without faith, nor faith without repentance; partly,
   because there is no use of faith without repentance. Christ as mediator
   is the means; now the means are of no use without respect to the end.
   Now Christ and the whole gospel grace is the means to come to God.
   Besides, these things cannot be graces but in a concomitancy.
   Repentance without faith, what would it be? When we see our sins, and
   bewail them, despair would make us sit down and die, if there were not
   a Saviour to heal our natures and convert our souls. Neither can faith
   be without repentance; for unless there be a confession of past sins,
   with a resolution of future obedience, we continue in our obstinacy and
   stubbornness, and so we are incapable of mercy, our case is not
   compassionable.

   In short, repentance without faith would degenerate into the horror of
   the damned, and our sorrow for sin would be tormenting rather curing to
   us. And then faith would be a licentious and presumptuous confidence
   without repentance: unless it be accompanied with this hearty consent
   of living in the love, obedience, and service of God, with a
   detestation of our former ways, it would be a turning the grace of God
   into wantonness. Therefore these two always go together. Which is the
   first, I will not enter upon; but the one cannot be without the other.

   [2.] Let me show you wherein they differ: the one respects God, the
   other Christ.

   (1.) Repentance towards God. While we live in sin, we are not only out
   of our way, but out of our wits. We were sometimes foolish and
   disobedient, serving divers lusts and pleasures,' Titus iii. 3. We live
   in rebellion against him against whom we cannot make our party good;
   and withal contenting ourselves with a false transitory happiness
   instead of a solid and eternal one, we never come to our wits again
   till we think of returning to God. As the prodigal, when he came to
   himself,' he thought of returning to his father; and Ps. xxii. 27, They
   shall remember, and turn to the Lord.' So long as we lie in our sins,
   we are like men in a dream, we consider not from whence we are, nor
   whither we are going, nor what shall become of us to all eternity; but
   go on against all reason and conscience, provoking God, and destroying
   our own souls. Man is never in his true posture again, till he returns
   to God as his sovereign Lord and chief happiness: as our sovereign
   Lord, that we may perform our duty to him; and our felicity and chief
   good, that we may seek all our happiness in him. And none do repent but
   those that give up themselves to obey God and to do his will, as he is
   the sovereign Lord: 1 Peter iv. 2, That he no longer should live the
   rest of his time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the will of
   God;' and look upon him as their chief happiness, and prefer his favour
   above all the sensual pleasures of the world, that they may be able in
   truth to say, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
   earth I desire besides thee,' Ps. lxxiii. 25. This is repentance
   towards God.

   (2.) There is faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This grace is necessary,
   that we may own our Redeemer, and be thankful to him, as the author of
   our deliverance: Rom. vii. 25, wretched man that I am! But thanks be to
   God through Jesus Christ our Lord.' And also faith is necessary, that
   we may trust ourselves in his hands. We are to take Christ as our
   prophet, priest, and king; to hear him as our prophet: Mat. xvii. 5,
   This is my beloved Son, hear him.' We are to receive him as our Lord
   and King: Col. ii. 6, As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
   walk ye in him.' We are to consider him as the great high priest of our
   confession: Heb. iii. 1, Let us consider the Lord Jesus, the great
   apostle and high priest of our confession.' Hear him we must as a
   prophet, that we may form our hopes by his covenant, and frame our
   lives by his holy and pure doctrine. Receive him we must as a king,
   that we may obey him in all things. Consider him as a priest, that we
   may depend upon the merit and value of his sacrifice and intercession,
   and may the more confidently plead his covenant and promises to God.
   Now without this there can be no commerce between us and Christ. Who
   will learn of him as a prophet, whom he takes to be a deceiver? obey
   him as a king, who doth not believe his power? or depend upon him with
   any confidence or hopes of mercy, if he doth not believe the value of
   his merit and sacrifice? Herein these things differ--repentance towards
   God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; the one respects the end, God;
   the other the means, Christ. Repentance more especially respects our
   duty; faith, our comfort. Repentance, newness of life for the future,
   and returning to the primitive duty, the love of God, and obeying his
   will; faith, pardon of what is past, and hope of mercy to come. In
   short, to God we give up ourselves as our supreme Lord; to Christ as
   Mediator, who alone can bring us to God: to God, as taking his will for
   the rule of our lives and actions, and preferring his love above all
   that is dear in the world; to Christ as our Lord and Saviour, who makes
   our peace with God, and gives the Holy Spirit to change our hearts,
   that we may for ever live upon him as our life, hope, and strength.
   Thus I have briefly showed you how repentance respects God, and faith
   our Lord Jesus Christ.

   3. That these graces having their peculiar reference, are required in
   order to pardon, for distinct reasons and ends.

   First, Repentance is required for these reasons:--

   [1.] Because otherwise God cannot have his end in pardon, which is to
   recover the lost creation, that we may again live in his love and
   obedience. Surely Christ came to seek and save that which was lost.
   Now, to be lost, in the first and primitive sense, was to be lost to
   God. Take the lost sheep or groat, it was lost to the owner, the son to
   the father; and so, if Christ came to save that which was lost, he came
   to recover us to God, therefore said to redeem us to God.

   [2.] Neither can the Redeemer do his work for which God hath appointed
   him: 1 Peter iii. 18, He died, the just for the unjust, that he might
   bring us to God.' We accept him in all his offices for this end: I am
   the way, truth, and life; no man comes to the Father but by me.'
   Therefore, whole Christianity, from the beginning to the end, a short
   description of it is this,--a coming to God by Christ: Heb. vii. 25, He
   is able to save to the uttermost.' Whom?--all those that come to God by
   him.'

   [3.] Without it we should not have our happiness. It is our happiness
   to please and enjoy God. We are not in a capacity to please and enjoy
   God till we are returned to him: They that are in the flesh cannot
   please the Lord;' nor to enjoy him here, for here we see his face in
   righteousness ,' nor hereafter, for without holiness no man shall see
   God.'

   Secondly, But why is faith in our Lord Jesus Christ required, and so
   much spoken of in scripture? I will content myself but with two reasons
   at this time:--

   [1.] Faith in Christ is most fitted for the acceptance of God's free
   gift. Faith and grace do always go together, and are put as opposite to
   law and works: Rom. iv. 16, It is of faith that it may be of grace:'
   Eph. ii. 8, For by grace ye are saved through faith, and not of your
   selves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should
   boast.' Faith establishes and keeps up the interest and honour of
   grace; for it is the free grace and favour of God to condescend to the
   rebel world, so far as he hath done in the new covenant. We present
   ourselves before him as those that stand wholly to his mercy, have
   nothing to plead for ourselves but the righteousness and merit of our
   Redeemer, by virtue of which we humbly beg pardon and life to be begun
   in us by his Spirit, and perfected in glory.

   [2.] Why faith in Christ? Because the way of our recovery is so strange
   and wonderful. It can only be received by faith; sense can not convey
   it to us, reason will not, and nothing is reserved for the
   entertainment of this glorious mystery, pardon, and salvation by our
   Redeemer, but faith alone. If I should deduce this argument at large, I
   would show you nothing but faith, or the belief of God's testimony
   concerning his Son, can support us in these transactions with God. The
   comfort of the promise is so rich and glorious, sense and reason cannot
   inform us of it: Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter
   into the heart of man to conceive, the things God hath prepared for
   them that love him,' 1 Cor. ii. 9. It is not meant only of heaven, but
   of the whole preparations and rich provisions God hath made for us in
   the gospel. It is not a thing can-come to us by eye or ear, or the
   conceiving of man's heart; we only believe and entertain it by faith.
   And then, the persons upon whom it is bestowed are so unworthy, that
   certainly it cannot enter into the heart of man that God will be so
   good, and do so much good to such. Adam, when he had sinned, grew shy
   of God, and ran away from him. Besides, the way God hath taken for our
   deliverance is so supernatural: God so loved the world, that he sent
   his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life.' That God should become man, that he
   should submit to such an accursed death for our sakes, is so high and
   glorious, it can only be entertained by faith. Besides, our chief
   blessedness lies in another world: He that lacketh faith is blind, and
   cannot see afar off.' Here in this lower world, where our God is
   unseen, and our great hopes are to come, where the flesh is so
   importunate to be pleased, where our temptations and trials are so
   many, and difficulties so great, we are apt to question all, and we can
   never keep waiting upon God, were it not for faith, and a steady belief
   in the Lord Jesus Christ. For these reasons (if you look into the
   scriptures), it is why faith is so much insisted upon, that we may keep
   up the honour of God's grace, and because this grace of the Redeemer is
   so mysterious and wonderful.

   4. The use of these two graces discovers their nature. What is faith
   and repentance? Repentance towards God is a turning from sin to God.
   The terminus a quo of repentance is our begun recovery from sin, and
   therefore called, Repentance from dead works,' Heb. vi. 1. The terminus
   ad quem, to which we return, is God, and our being devoted to God in
   obedience and love. God never hath our hearts till he hath our love and
   delight, till we return to a love of his blessed majesty, and delight
   in his ways. This is called in scripture some times a turning to God,
   in many other places a seeking after God, a giving up ourselves to God:
   2 Cor. viii. 5, They gave up themselves to the Lord.' This is the
   repentance by which we enter into the gospel state. Now what is faith?
   Besides an assent to the gospel, which is at the bottom of it, it is a
   serious, thankful, broken-hearted acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ,
   that he may be to every one of us what God hath appointed him to be,
   and do for every one of us what God hath appointed him to do for poor
   sinners; it is serious and broken-hearted, done by a creature in
   misery, and thankful for such a wonderful benefit, a trusting to this
   Redeemer, that he may do the work of a redeemer in our hearts, to save
   us from the evil of, and after, sin.

   And thus I have briefly opened this necessary doctrine, as clearly laid
   in the scripture. And this is your entrance in the evangelic state.

   II. For our continuance therein; for we must not only mind our
   entrance, but our continuance. Our Lord Jesus tells us of a gate and a
   way: the gate signifies the entrance, and the way our continuance. And
   we read of making and keeping covenant with God; we read of union with
   Christ, that is our first entrance. For this faith is the closing act,
   and expressed sometimes by a being married to Christ. But there is not
   only an union with Christ, but an abiding in him: Abide in me, and I
   will abide in you.' Now as for our continuance, I would show you that
   the first works are gone over and over again, faith and repentance are
   still necessary: For the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to
   faith.' And repentance is still necessary. But I shall only press two
   things--first, new obedience; secondly, daily prayer.

   1. New obedience is required: 1 John i. 7, If we walk in the light, as
   he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood
   of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.' Holy walking is
   necessary to the continuance of our being cleansed from sin, and
   therefore mercy is promised to the forsaking of our sins: Prov. xxviii.
   13, He that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall find mercy;' Isa.
   lv. 7, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thought; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.' Our hearts were
   not sound with God in the first covenanting if we undo what was done:
   If we build again the things we have destroyed, then we are found
   transgressors,' Gal. ii. 18. Well, then, a man that seeks after pardon,
   seeks after it with the ruin and destruction of sin. Sin was the
   greatest burden that lay upon his conscience, the grievance from whence
   he sought ease, the wound pained him at heart, the disease his soul was
   sick of. And was all this anguish real? And shall a man come to delight
   in his sores again, and take up the burden he groaned under, and tear
   open the wound that was in a fair way of healing, and willingly relapse
   into the sickness he was almost recovered from with so much ado? Sure
   this shows our first consent was not real and sincere. And then Christ
   will be no advocate for them that continue in their sins. Our God is a
   God of salvation,' we cannot enough speak of his saving mercy; but he
   will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one
   as goeth on still in his trespasses,' Ps. lxviii. 20, 21.

   2. Daily prayer. [This was spoken unto at the close of the first
   sermon.] Mat. vi. 12. Our Lord hath taught us to pray (for we make but
   too much work for pardoning mercy every day), Every day forgive us our
   trespasses.' To-day in one of the petitions, is common to all that
   follow; as we beg daily bread, we must beg daily pardon, daily grace
   against temptations. Under the law they had a lamb every morning and
   every evening offered to God for a daily sacrifice, Num. xxviii. 4-6.
   We are all invited to look to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the
   sins of the world. Surely we have as much need as they--more cause than
   they, because now all is clear and openly made known unto us. God came
   to Adam in the cool of the day; he would not let him sleep in his sins:
   before night came he comes and rouseth his conscience, and then gives
   out the promise of the seed of the woman that should break the
   serpent's head. In reconciliation with God let not the sun go down upon
   God's wrath, Eph. iv. 26. A man should not sleep in his anger, nor out
   of charity with man; surely we should make our peace with God every
   day. If a man under the law had contracted any uncleanness, he was to
   wash his clothes before evening, that he might not lie a night in his
   uncleanness. We should daily, earnestly, come to God with this request,
   Lord, pardon our sins. But what! must those that are already adopted
   into God's family, and taken into his grace and favour, daily pray for
   pardon of sin? Though upon our first faith our state be changed, and we
   are indeed made children of God, and heirs of eternal life by faith in
   Christ Jesus, yet he that is clean need wash his feet. We contract a
   great deal of sinful defilement and pollution by walking up and down
   here in a dirty world, and we must every day be cleansing our
   consciences before God, and begging that we may be made partakers of
   this benefit.

   III. The third thing is our recovery out of grievous lapses and falls.
   In them there is required a particular and express repentance; and
   repentance and faith must be carried with respect to those four things
   that are in sin: culpa, the fault, reatus, the guilt, macula, the stain
   and blot, and poena, the punishment. You know the law supposeth a
   righteous nature that God gives to man, therefore in sin there is a
   stain or blot, defacing God's image. The precepts of the law require
   duty, so it is culpa, a criminal act; the sanction of the law as
   threatened makes way for guilt, as executed calls for punishment; you
   see how it ariseth.

   1. For the fault in the transgression of the law, or the criminal
   action. See that the fault be not continued; relapses are very
   dangerous. A bone often broken in the same place is hardly set again.
   God's children are in danger of this before the breach be well made up,
   or the orifice of the wound be soundly closed; as Lot doubled his
   incest, and Samson goes in again and again to Delilah. But in wicked
   men frequently, as that king sent fifty after fifty, and nothing would
   stop him. There is an express forsaking of sin required of us,
   otherwise it would abolish all the difference between the renewed and
   the carnal.

   2. The guilt continues till serious and solemn repentance, and
   humiliation before God, and suing out our pardon in Christ's name. 1
   John i. 9, he speaks of believers: If we confess our sins, he is
   faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness.' There must be a solemn humbling for the sin, and then
   God will forgive us. Suppose a man forbear the act, and never commit it
   more (as Judah forbore the act, after he had committed incest with
   Tamar, but it seems he repented not till she showed him the bracelets
   and the staff); yet with serious remorse we must beg our peace humbly
   upon the account of our Mediator. Therefore some thing must be done to
   take away the guilt.

   3. There is the blot or evil inclination to sin again. The blot of sin
   in general is the defacing of God's image, but in particular sins it is
   some weakening of the reverence of God. A man cannot venture to act a
   grievous wilful sin, but there is a violent obstruction of the fear of
   God. A brand that hath been in the fire is more apt to take fire again;
   the evil influences of the sin continue. Now the root of sin must be
   mortified, it is not enough to forbear or confess a sin, but we must
   pull out the core of the distemper before all will be well. As Jonah,
   he repented of his tergiversation and forsaking his call. The fault was
   not repeated: he goes to Nineveh and does his duty. Yet the core of the
   distemper was not taken away; for you read of him, Jonah iv. 2, Was not
   this my saying, when I was yet in my country? therefore I fled before
   unto Tarshish: for I knew thou wert a gracious God, and repentest thee
   of the evil.' On the contrary, Peter fell into a grievous sin, denying
   his Lord and Master with oaths and execrations; but afterwards, John
   xxi. 15, Christ tries him: Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Lovest thou me
   more than these?' pointing to the rest of his disciples. Peter had been
   bragging, Mat. xxvi. 33, Though all men forsake thee, yet I will not
   forsake thee.' Now when he was foiled, though he had wept bitterly for
   his fault, Christ tries if the cause be removed: Lord, saith he, thou
   knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.' But he doth not say
   now, more than these.' The root of the distemper was gone; Peter is
   grown more modest now than to make comparisons.

   4. There is the punishment. Now we must deprecate eternal punishment,
   and bless God for Jesus Christ, who hath delivered us from wrath to
   come.' But as to temporal evils, God hath reserved a liberty in the
   covenant to his wisdom and fatherly justice, to inflict temporal
   punishments as he shall see good. If they break his statutes, and keep
   not his commandments; then will he visit their transgression with the
   rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my loving-kindness I
   will not utterly take from them, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail,'
   Ps. lxxxix. 32, 33. If judgment begin at the house of God,' what shall
   become of the sinner and ungodly? The righteous are recompensed upon
   earth, partly to increase their repentance, that when they smart under
   the fruit of sin, they may best judge of the evil of it. God doth in
   effect say, Now know it is an evil and bitter thing to sin against me,'
   God doth not do it to complete their justification, but to promote
   their sanctification, and to make us warnings to others, that they may
   not displease God as we do. Now for these reasons the Lord, though he
   doth forgive the sin and release the eternal punishment, yet he
   reserves a liberty to chastise us in our persons, families, and
   relations. Therefore what is our business? Humbly deprecate this
   temporal judgment: Lord, correct me not in thine anger, nor chasten me
   in thy hot displeasure.' We should be instant with God to get it
   stopped or mitigated; but if the Lord see it fit it shall come,
   patiently submit to him, and say, as the church, I will bear the
   indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.' These
   afflictive evils, some of them belong to God's external government, and
   some to his internal. Some to his external government, as when many are
   sick, and weak, and fallen asleep: When we are judged, we are chastened
   of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.' A rod dipped
   in guilt may smart sore upon the back of God's children, if they will
   play the wantons and rebels with God. Eli broke his neck, his sons were
   killed in battle, the ark taken. But then there are some other things
   belonging to his internal government, as the withdrawing the comforts
   of his Spirit, or the lively influences of his grace; for this was the
   evil David feared when he had gone into wilful sins: Ps. li. 11, 12,
   Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not away thy Holy Spirit
   from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with
   thy free Spirit.' When God's children fall into sin, though the Lord
   doth not utterly take away his lovingkindness from them, he may abate
   the influences of his grace so far as they may never recover the like
   measure again as long as they live.

SERMON III.

   Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless
   you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.--Acts III.
   26.

   THESE words are the conclusion of the second sermon that was preached
   after the pouring out of the Spirit, and in them you may observe three
   things:--

   I. The parties concerned: unto you first.

   II. The benefit offered: God, having raised up his Son Jesus, hath sent
   him to bless you.

   III. The blessing interpreted, or what kind of blessing it is we shall
   have by the Mediator: he hath sent him to bless you, in turning every
   one of you from your iniquities.

   Let me a little open these, before I come to observe anything.

   I. For the parties concerned: unto you first. Why was the first offer
   of Christ made unto the people of the Jews? For sundry reasons.
   Partly:--

   1. Because they were the only church of God for that time, and the
   people that were in visible communion with him. And God hath so much
   respect for the church, that they shall have the refusal and the
   morning-market of the gospel. And whatsoever dispensations of grace are
   set on foot shall be first brought to them: He hath showed his statutes
   unto Jacob: he hath not dealt so with other nations,' Ps. cxlvii. 19.

   2. They were the children of the covenant: Ye are the children of the
   covenant,' therefore unto you first,' God was in covenant with their
   fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and God follows a covenant people
   with more offers of grace than he doth vouchsafe unto others, and bears
   with sin after sin till he can bear no longer. And when the branches of
   the covenant-stock run quite wild, then they are cut off, Rom. xi. 20.

   3. Christ came of them after the flesh, and was of their seed, Rom. ix.
   5; to teach us first to seek the salvation of our kindred, and
   countrymen, and near relations: those that are nearer to us lie next
   our work and service. Therefore, to you first.

   4. That he might magnify his grace and faithfulness, not only in the
   matter of the gospel, but even in the first offer of it. He doth
   magnify his faithfulness herein, for it is said, Christ is the minister
   of the circumcision to confirm the truth to their fathers,' Rom. xv. 8.
   God had promised their fathers that he would raise up a Saviour,
   therefore he must be first discovered here; and he magnifies his grace,
   for there was Christ preached where he was crucified. They had the
   first handsel of this good news, and wrath came not upon them to the
   uttermost till they had despised the gospel, as well as killed the Lord
   of glory, 1 Thes. ii. 14, 15.

   5. This was necessary too for the confirmation of the gospel: to you
   first Christ did not sneak nor steal into the world clancularly and
   privately, but he would have his law set up where it was likely to be
   most questioned. They were most concerned to inquire into the truth of
   matters of fact upon which the credit of the gospel had depended. If he
   had first gone to the Gentiles, the Jews might have objected their
   condemning Christ as a malefactor, and that his messengers and apostles
   durst not set on foot the report of his miracles, life, and death in
   their confines. But Christ would have the gospel preached there, where,
   if there were any falsehood in it, it might easily be disproved; and
   because the main of the Jewish doctrine was adopted into the Christian,
   and was confirmed by the prophecies of the Old Testament, they were the
   only competent judges to whose cognisance these things should be first
   offered. Therefore he saith, Unto you first, God, having raised up his
   Son Jesus, sent him to bless you.'

   6. That the ruin of that nation might be a fit document and proof of
   God's severity against the contemners of the new gospel, Acts xiii.
   45-47. There it is showed that they were the first people to whom it
   was offered, and they contemned it, and therefore wrath came upon them
   to the uttermost. Therefore this did authorise and confirm this
   doctrine, wherever it should be preached and offered.

   7. That the first ministers might be a pattern of obedience, to preach
   where God would have them, to preach in the very face and teeth of
   opposition. Christ appoints their station. The Jews were like to be the
   most virulent enemies against the gospel, because the rulers put Christ
   to death: Go, preach the gospel to all nations, but begin at Jerusalem,
   though there you meet with a great deal of spite and opposition. Now,
   because of these reasons, Unto you first, the Lord, having raised up
   his Son,' &c.

   II. The second thing to be explained is the benefit offered: wherein is
   set forth the great love of God unto the people to whom the gospel
   comes.

   1. In designing such a glorious person as Jesus Christ: having raised
   up his Son Jesus.

   2. In that he gave notice, and did especially direct and send him to
   them: hath sent his Son.

   3. Why he came among them in his word: it was to bless them.

   [1.] In designing the person who should do them good, God hath raised
   up his Son Jesus.' It may seem to be meant of his resurrection from the
   dead; but I think rather to raise up is to exalt, to call, to
   authorise, to appoint to some notable work; and it is used for
   installing, consecrating, as in this very chapter: ver. 22, He shall
   raise up a prophet from among you;' Acts xiii. 23, Of this man's seed
   hath God raised up to Israel a Saviour;' that is, hath put authority
   upon him, given him commission to save sinners, raised up, designed him
   to this work. But then:--

   [2.] The special direction of his providence: God having raised up his
   Son Jesus, hath sent him to bless you.' Sometimes the word is said to
   be sent to us: Acts xiii. 26, To you is this word of salvation sent.'
   He doth not say, We have brought this salvation to you, but To you it
   is sent,' God hath a great hand in directing the course of the gospel.
   And sometimes Christ is said to be sent, as here in the text; for where
   the gospel is preached to a people, Christ is sent to them as a token
   from heaven; if he be neglected, you despise the riches and bounty of
   God, and the best and choicest gift that ever could be bestowed upon
   the sons of men. Therefore he saith, God having raised his Son, hath
   sent him.' Where the gospel goes, there Christ is sent; there he conies
   that he may have work to do.

   [3.] Here is the end and purport of his coming; not to take vengeance
   of the affronts and contumelies they had put upon him, but he comes to
   bless. For the opening of this word, you must look to the preceding
   verse. He speaks of the covenant made with Abraham, In thy seed shall
   all the nations of the earth be blessed.' Now Jesus was sent unto them
   to assure this blessing. The blessing is any good that accrues and
   results to us from the covenant of grace, but chiefly those special
   blessings we have by Christ, reconciliation with God, and life eternal,
   those things which he minded to purchase for us, and hath dispensed to
   us by his gracious covenant. This is the blessing intended,--All
   nations are to be blessed in the seed of Abraham; now God having raised
   Christ of this man's seed, hath sent him to bless you.

   III. Here is the blessing interpreted and restrained, and that is
   conversion from sin: In turning every one of you from his sins.' They
   expected a pompous Messiah, that should make them an opulent and potent
   nation. But Christ came upon another errand, to convert souls unto God.
   Only mark, when the apostle speaks this, he speaks it not of the
   intention of God, but the offer of his grace; otherwise every
   particular Jew must be converted, or God missed his end. God may send
   him to bless, and yet some may contemn the offer; others God prevents
   by the special efficacy of his grace, or else all would contemn it.
   They that do contemn it are justly passed by; and they that receive it,
   owe it to his grace, and not to themselves. It was the secret purpose
   of his grace to bring in many, and this brought in three thousand men.
   There were others refused this blessing offered from the Mediator, and
   they justly perish for their unbelief.

   The point, though there be many, that I shall insist on, is:--

   Doct. That a main blessing we have by Christ is to be turned from our
   iniquities.

   I. Here I shall inquire, What it is to be turned from sin.

   II. I shall show you, That certainly this is a very blessed thing.

   III. That this is the great blessing of the Mediator that we have by
   Christ in the gospel.

   IV. In what manner Christ turneth us from our iniquities.

   I. What it is to be turned from sin. Take these considerations:--

   1. Man fallen, lay under the power and guilt of sin: he was dead in
   trespasses and sins, and liable to the wrath of God,' Eph. ii. 1-3. So
   man was both unholy and guilty.

   2. Christ came to free us from both these. The guilt: Eph. i. 7, In
   whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins;' and
   the power: Titus iii. 5, He hath saved us by the washing of
   regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost.' To be freed from guilt,
   and delivered from hell and wrath to come, is a blessing for which we
   can never be sufficiently thankful; but to be freed from sin, that is
   the greater mercy, and therefore he hath sent his Son to bless you, in
   turning every one of you from your sins.'

   3. To be turned from sin implies our whole conversion. Though one part
   only be mentioned, the term from which, yet the term to which is
   implied; that we are turned to God as well as turned from sin; to God,
   as our happiness, and our supreme Lord, that we may love him, and be
   happy in being beloved by him. Acts xxvi. 18.

   4. That remission of sins is included in our conversion to God. The
   meaning is, that he may turn you from your unbelief and impenitency,
   and so make you capable of his pardon and mercy; for so it is
   explained, ver. 19, Repent, and be converted, that your sins may be
   blotted out,' &c. Without sound repentance the Mediator's blessing will
   not be had; and when Christ came to save us from wrath, his way was to
   turn us from sin. These two must not be severed: God hath exalted him
   to be a prince and Saviour, to give repentance and remission of sins,'
   Acts v. 31. You see, then, what is meant by the blessing the Mediator
   offers,--to be turned from our sins.

   II. It is a blessed thing to be made partakers of this benefit.
   Blessedness imports two things: negatively, a removal of evil; and
   positively, a fruition or enjoyment of some great good. When we are
   turned from our sins, there is both.

   1. An immunity from, or a removal of, the great evil, and that is sin.

   [1.] The great cause of offence between God and us is taken out of the
   way: Isa. lix. 2, Your iniquities have separated between you and your
   God, and have hidden his face from you.' Sin makes the distance between
   you and God, that you cannot delight in God, nor God in you. You cannot
   delight in God, for your hearts are alienated from him. You are become
   enemies in your mind by wicked works.' Where sin reigns, man is an
   enemy to God; partly through carnal prepossession: there is something
   takes up his heart, and diverts it from God: 1 John ii. 15, If any man
   love the world, how dwelleth the love of the Father in him?' His heart
   is taken up with another love. And partly through carnal liberty: we
   cannot enjoy our lusts with that freedom and security, by reason of the
   restraints of his law, that would curb us and cut us short of our
   desires; and partly through slavish fear. We hate those whom we fear. A
   condemning God can never be loved by a guilty creature. We look upon
   him as one that will call us to an account for our sins. Now, all these
   reasons concur to show us, that till sin be taken away, we cannot love
   nor delight in God, neither can God love us and delight in us. God will
   not have communion with us while we are in our sins. Christ, when he
   came to bring us to God, he came not to make any change in God, to make
   God less holy, but to make us holy and amiable in his sight. The
   reasonable nature cannot digest this conceit, that the holy God should
   take sinners into his bosom without any change. Would it become the
   governor of the world to be indifferent to good and bad, the holy God
   to be a friend to sinners? The new nature in, us showeth the contrary;
   for that causes an abomination and abhorrence both of impurity and the
   impure; as Lot's righteous soul was vexed with the Sodomites. And we
   are told, Prov. xxix. 27, An unjust man is an abomination to the just,
   and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.' If a
   man be sanctified but in part, he cannot delight in the wicked freely
   to converse with them. He hath a hatred, not of enmity so as to seek
   their destruction, not a hatred opposite to good-will--that is contrary
   to the nature of grace, which is made up of love--but a hatred of
   abomination, which is contrary to the love of complacency; he cannot
   take any delight in him. Now, then, without a manifest reproach to the
   holy God, we cannot imagine he should admit sinners into an intimate
   communion with him: Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity,' Ps. v. 5.
   God said to the prophet, Jer. xv. 19, Let them return unto thee, but
   return not thou to them,' God will not return to us in our sins, but we
   must come off from our sins to him.

   [2.] We are freed from the great blemish of our natures. Sin defaced
   the image of God in us: Rom. iii. 23, All have sinned, and come short
   of the glory of God.' We lost not only the favour of God, but the image
   of God; the great excellency of our nature was eclipsed and defaced.
   Now the plaster will not be as broad as the sore, nor our reparation by
   Christ correspondent to our loss by Adam, if our nature be not healed,
   and the image of God restored in us. If Adam had only left us guilty,
   the pardon of sin had been enough; but he conveyed an evil nature, and
   therefore we must be turned from our sins, as well as pardoned,
   otherwise Christ would not restore all that Adam took away, Ps. lxix.
   4. Is he a good physician that takes away the pain, and leaves the
   great disease uncured? But Christ has procured the favour of God for
   us, and repaired the image of God in us, and therefore certainly put us
   into a way of blessedness again. Holiness was our primitive excellency
   and amiableness.

   [3.] We are freed from that that is the great burden of the creature,
   as well as his blemish. Whatever it be to the common sinner, that is no
   matter; he hath no right thoughts of things, and is besotted with his
   carnal choice; for sin is an evil, whether it be felt or no. But the
   awakened sinner is sensible not only of the guilt of sin, but it is his
   greatest burden that he should have a nature inclines him to grieve and
   dishonour God. Pharaoh could say, Take away this plague.' But a
   penitent, broken-hearted sinner cries, Take away all iniquity.' They
   desire a change of this state by regeneration. Therefore the promises
   of the gospel, considering a penitent soul under such a distress, are
   suited to the case: 1 John i. 9, If we confess our sins, he is faithful
   and just to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness.' If you know what sin is, and penitently bemoan
   yourselves to God, you will be troubled with the power and pollution of
   it, as well as the guilt: Micah vii. 18, 19, Who is a God like unto
   thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
   remnant of his heritage? He will turn again, he will have compassion,
   he will subdue our iniquities.' A heart truly affected doth not only
   desire pardon and ease, but power against sin. A man that hath his leg
   broken would not only desire ease of his pain, but to have his leg set
   right again. A leprous condemned malefactor desires not only to be
   freed from the sentence of condemnation, but to be cured, or his pardon
   will do him no good. Now, surely, it is a great blessing to be turned
   from our sins, to be freed from that a penitent soul finds to be so
   great a burden; and the Mediator gives us a not able proof of his love
   in it.

   [4.] Being turned from our sins, we are freed from the great bane of
   our persons and all our happiness. Sin is a cursed inmate, it fires the
   lodging where it is entertained and harboured, unless speedily cast out
   of doors; it involves us in the curse of the law, The wages of sin is
   death;' therefore Christ, that he might free us from misery, doth first
   free us from sin. If pardon of sin be a blessing, certainly to be
   turned from sin is a blessing (for the one cannot be had without the
   other); till you are turned from sin you cannot be pardoned, not
   justified till you are sanctified: Ps. xxxii. 1, 2, Blessed is the man
   whose sin is forgiven, and whose iniquity is covered, and unto whom the
   Lord will not impute his sin, in whose spirit there is no guile.' When
   God hath given us a holy sincere heart, and turned us from our sins,
   then we have the blessedness of pardon: There is no condemnation to
   them that are in Christ, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
   spirit,' Rom. viii. 1. We are freed from the condemning power of the
   law when freed from sin, and all that woe and wrath that belongs to
   every soul that doth evil.

   By all these considerations it appears how great a blessing the turning
   us from sin is in the privative notion, that is, the removal of so
   great an evil.

   2. Take blessedness in the positive notion, that is, to enjoy a great
   good; and it will appear it is a blessed thing to be turned from our
   sins.

   [1.] Because this is the matter of our serenity, comfort, and peace
   here, and the pledge and beginning of our eternal felicity hereafter.
   The soul can never be settled in a holy peace till it be turned from
   its sins; we can never find rest till we get out of Satan's yoke and
   get into Christ's blessed liberty: The fruit of righteousness is
   peace,' Isa. xxxii. 17. We are freed from those unquiet and troublesome
   thoughts wherewith others are haunted. A wicked man's soul is in a
   mutiny, one affection wars against another, and all against the
   conscience, and the conscience against all; but where the heart is
   framed to the obedience of God's will, there is peace. Pax est
   tranquillitas ordinis, when all things keep their place, as in an
   accurate orderly life they do: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according
   to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and the whole Israel of
   God.' There is peace, for there is a harmonious Accord between God and
   them, and between them and themselves: Ps. cxix. 165, Great peace have
   they that love thy law;' not only peace, but great peace, a peace that
   passeth all understanding.' Whilst we are in our sins, there is ever a
   fear of the war which is between God and us, and there is a war in
   ourselves, conscience disallowing our practices, and our practices
   disliking the conduct of conscience, so that there is no peace to the
   wicked. But when the Lord Jesus hath taken us in hand, and begun to
   cure us, and frame us aright, and show us his wonderful grace in
   turning us from our sins, here is matter provided for serenity and
   peace.

   [2.] It is the pledge of our eternal felicity hereafter; for heaven is
   the perfection of holiness, or the full fruition of God in glory. Now,
   when the Mediator begins to take away sin, he blesses you; for the life
   is then begun which shall be perfected in heaven. Unless it be begun
   here, it will never be perfected there: for without holiness no man
   shall see God,' Heb. xii. 14. But if it be begun, it will surely be
   perfected there; for Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
   God.' The vision and fruition of God is begun here, the spirit of
   holiness is the earnest of our inheritance, Eph. i. 13, 14. Oh, what
   blessedness is it then to have the new heart planted into us by Christ,
   and to live the new life! It is the beast about you that delights in
   the momentary, base, dreggy pleasures of sin. But when Christ hath
   turned you from your sins, you are blessed indeed, you are in the way
   to blessedness, and you shall be blessed for ever; he gives peace as a
   pledge of happiness and eternal glory.

   III. I shall prove that this is the Mediator's blessing.

   1. Let me lay down this, that those blessings that are most proper to
   the Mediator are spiritual blessings. We forfeited all by sin, but
   especially the grace of the Spirit, whereby we might be made service
   able to God. Other mercies run in the channel of common providence, but
   spiritual blessings are the discriminating graces and favours that are
   given us by the Mediator: Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in heavenly places.' Christ came not to distribute honours, and
   greatness, and worldly riches to his followers, but to turn away every
   one of us from our sins, to reduce us to God, that we may love him, and
   be beloved of him. He came as a spiritual Saviour, to give us grace
   rather than temporal happiness. Most men have a carnal, Jewish notion
   of Christ, they would have a temporal safety and happiness, they would
   have deliverance from affliction, rather than deliverance from sin. To
   be delivered from every evil work' is more than to be delivered from
   the mouth of the lion.' This is most proper to the Mediator, 2 Tim. iv.
   18. A sanctified use of troubles is more than an exemption from them; a
   carnal man may have exemption from them, but not a sanctified use of
   them. Poverty, lameness, blindness, are not as bad as ignorance, unruly
   lusts, and want of grace. Moral evils are worse than natural. Daniel
   was cast into a lion's den, you would think that was a misery; but it
   was a greater misery when Nebuchadnezzar was thrust out among the
   beasts, being given up to a brutish heart. Exemption from trouble may
   be hurtful to us, but deliverance from sin is never hurtful to us.

   Among the spiritual blessings we have by the Mediator, conversion from
   sin to God is the chiefest we have on this side heaven. That it was the
   main part of Christ's undertaking, I shall prove by scripture and
   reason. For scripture, the text is clear for it; for thus the apostle
   interprets the covenant-blessing, In thy seed shall all nations of the
   earth be blessed,' namely, God hath sent him to bless you.' Wherein?'
   In turning every one of you from your sins.' He shall be called Jesus,
   for he shall save his people from their sins,' Mat. i. 21; not only
   from the guilt, but the power of sin; not only from the evil after sin,
   but the evil of sin itself. Denominatio est a majori--the name is taken
   from what is chiefest. And so when he is promised to the Jews, The
   Redeemer shall come out of Sion, and he shall turn away ungodliness
   from Jacob.' There is his principal work: 1 John iii. 5, Christ came to
   take away sin, and in him is no sin.' He means not only the condemning
   power, but the power of it in the heart; for he is pleading arguments
   for holiness, why believers should not run into sin, which is a
   transgression of the law.' One is from the undertaking of Christ, he
   came to take away sin;' and from the example of Christ, in him is no
   sin.' He plainly means the power of sin.

   2. Now, to give you some reasons why this is the chief benefit, most
   eyed by Christ, and should be most regarded by us.

   [1.] Christ's undertaking was principally for the glory of God: All the
   promises are in him, yea and amen, to the glory of God;' and it should
   not be a question which should have the precedence, the glory of God or
   our good. Christ came to promote God's glory, and that must have the
   precedence of our benefit. Now, then, the abolishing the guilt of sin
   doth more directly respect our interest and good; but the abolishing
   the power of sin, or the turning and cleansing the heart from it, doth
   more immediately respect the glory of God, and our subjection to God.
   Therefore Christ would not only pacify the wrath of God, but his chief
   work, that doth mostly concern the glory of God, was to heal our evil
   natures, and prevent sin for the time to come.

   [2.] To be turned from sin is to be freed from the greatest evil; for
   pardon gives us an exemption from punishment, which is a natural evil,
   but conversion gives us freedom from our naughty hearts, which is a
   moral evil; and, certainly, vice is worse than pain, and sin than
   misery. Besides, sin is the cause of all evil, and the taking away the
   cause is more than ceasing the effect.

   [3.] This hath nearer connection with the life of glory. Pardon only
   removes the impediment, but the sanctifying and healing of our natures
   is the beginning of the life of glory, and introduction into it. Pardon
   removes our guilt, which hinders our happiness; therefore, divines say,
   justification is gratia removens prohibens, that that removes the
   impediment; but the sanctifying the heart is an introduction into our
   glorious state, and the more sanctified the more meet to be partakers
   thereof, Col. i. 12. Now that which doth positively make us capable of
   glory and happiness is a greater privilege than that which only removes
   the impediment.

   [4.] That is the greatest benefit which makes us more amiable in the
   sight of God, and is the object of his delight. Now he delights in us
   as sanctified rather than pardoned. We love him, indeed, for pardoning
   and forgiving so great a debt: She loved much, because much was
   forgiven her;' but God delighteth in holiness, and the reflection and
   impress of his own image upon us: Prov. xi. 20, The upright in the way
   are his delight.' When the Spirit hath renewed us according to the
   image and nature of God, that makes us amiable in his sight, and an
   object of divine complacency; therefore, surely this is the great
   privilege and blessing we have by the Mediator here in this world. I
   come to the fourth thing.

   IV. In what way doth Christ turn us from our iniquities?

   1. He doth purchase this grace for us; and--

   2. He works it in us.

   1. He purchaseth this grace for us that we may be turned: 1 Peter ii.
   24, He bore our sins in his own body upon the tree, that we, being dead
   unto sin, should live unto righteousness.' That was his end, not only
   to lay the obligation upon us, but to procure the grace whereby we may
   be enabled to do so. This sacrifice was a truly propitiatory sacrifice,
   whereby God was appeased, and forfeited blessings restored. The loss of
   God's image was a great part of our punishment, and it is a part of our
   deliverance that Christ hath purchased this grace as well as pardon. He
   hath given himself for us, that he might cleanse us, and sanctify us,
   and make us a pure and holy people unto God, Eph. v. 25, 26.

   2. As he hath purchased it for us, so he works it in us, partly by the
   power of his internal grace, and partly by blessing and sanctifying
   external means and helps for such an end and purpose.

   First, I say, by the power of his internal grace changing our hearts
   and minds: Titus iii. 5, 6, He saved us by the washing of regeneration,
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour;' and he acteth in us as Christ's Spirit, and
   as we are members of Christ. It is the Spirit enlightens the mind, so
   that we begin to see the evil that is in sin, the necessity to get rid
   of it: After I was instructed, I smote upon the thigh;' and also to
   overcome the obstinate heart of man and turn it to God, and to fix the
   inclination of the soul against sin. In short, by his preventing grace
   he doth convert us, by his exciting grace sanctify us, by his assisting
   grace he makes us persevere, in turning us more and more from sin to
   holiness.

   Secondly, He sanctifies and blesses external helps and means. I shall
   instance in two--ordinances and providences.

   [1.] Ordinances, such as the word and sacraments: John xvii. 19, I
   sanctified myself, that they might be sanctified by the truth,' that
   is, the preaching of the word. He gave himself for his church, that he
   might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water through the
   word.' Mark these and other places of scripture, and you will find the
   merit of Christ doth reach the ordinances, that by them grace may be
   conveyed, and sin might be mortified and subdued in us. The word calls
   us to excite our resolutions against sin, and strengthen them to avoid
   occasions to cut off the provisions of the flesh, to make it our daily
   task to war and strive against it; and none conscientiously wait upon
   the word but something by every attendance is given out for the
   weakening of sin and setting them afresh against it. And then the
   sacrament, that represents the death of Christ as the price of our
   dying to sin; and it represents him as the pattern according to which
   we must be conformed, that we may know that our old man is crucified,
   and that we may renew our covenant with God, and our resolutions, and
   bind ourselves to more serious endeavours against sin. The Lord Jesus,
   after he had procured the Spirit, and this wonderful grace to turn us
   from our sins, hath appointed congruous and fit ordinances, whereby he
   may dispense this grace to us more and more. And as he sanctifies
   ordinances, so--

   [2.] Providences; for we are threshed, that our husks may fly off.
   Wherefore doth he chasten us sometimes, and very sorely, but to make us
   out of love with sin: The fruit of all shall be to take away sin,' Isa.
   xxvii. 9; and He chastens us verily for our profit, that we may be made
   partakers of his holiness,' Heb. xii. 10. By all these means we are
   sanctified, by ordinances and providences, and by the all-powerful
   grace of this Holy Spirit.

   Thus I have opened the fourth thing, how the Lord Jesus doth turn us
   from our sins.

   The uses we may make of this point are:--

   I. Of information. It informs us:--

   1. Of the vain hopes of the carnal, and such as yet live in their sins;
   for at present they have no interest in him, and so living and dying
   will find him rather a judge than a Saviour, for the greatest part of
   their work is undone. We must be saved from the guilt and power of sin,
   and the latter is the proper sign of our recovery. We are justified in
   the name of the Lord Jesus, and sanctified also in the Spirit of our
   God.' Christ did not purchase our salvation by piecemeal, nor can we
   receive it by piecemeal; a whole Saviour we must have, or no Saviour.
   She was the true mother that pleaded against the dividing of the
   infant. They are true Christians, I am sure, who would have Christ
   undivided, who would have him wisdom, and righteousness, and
   sanctification, and redemption;' for if you take him in one respect and
   neglect him in another, especially the chief thing you should make use
   of him for, you do not take him at all. Therefore the carnal, that live
   in their sins, are at present excluded from all claim to Christ.

   2. It shows us what we should mainly seek in our prayers. Leave not the
   Redeemer till he hath blessed you with his principal blessing. Our
   prayers for temporal happiness are not so welcome to Christ as our
   prayers for sanctifying grace and power against sin. Natural sense will
   put us upon asking corn and wine and oil; but the new creature saith,
   Lord, take away iniquity. Every man hath a sense of outward evils, and
   would fain be at ease; but every man hath not a sense of sin, and an
   hunger and thirst after righteousness. Self-love will prompt us to beg
   exemption from trouble, but sin is the worst burden to a tender heart.
   When your children ask you for apples and plums, and such things as are
   pleasing to their childish appetite, they do not please you so much as
   when they desire you to teach them and instruct them in their duty,
   that they may not offend God and you. When you ask temporal things of
   God, you do not sin, for God hath given a liberty to ask daily bread;
   but when you ask grace, that you may be free from sin, that you may not
   offend God, or be a scandal to the gospel, this is most pleasing to
   God. When Solomon had asked wisdom, and not riches and honours, the
   thing pleased the Lord. These prayers are most acceptable to God, they
   will bring their answers with them; then you set your Redeemer about
   his proper work, for God sent him to bless you, in turning every one of
   you from your sins.' Nay; if you beg only for pardon, and do not mind
   the destruction of sin, you are no more willing to be saved than the
   devils are. Certainly the devils are willing to be saved from the wrath
   of God. Every creature seeks its own ease, and they would be eased of
   their torments. Every one would have eternal life: Evermore give us
   this bread.' But you are unwilling to be saved upon Christ's terms, if
   you will not let him mortify your lusts, and submit to his healing.

   3. If this be the Mediator's great blessing, to turn you from your
   sins, then it follows that those who have their corruptions most
   mortified are the best Christians. The Redeemer hath been at work in
   their hearts, and they have most of the Mediator's blessing. He is not
   the best Christian that hath the most plausible gifts, that can with
   art and parts best perform outward duties, that hath the strongest
   memory, clearest apprehension, readiest elocution; but he that hath a
   humble, mortified, holy, pure, and self-denying spirit; for this is a
   more weighty point of Christ's undertaking, to make you holy, humble,
   and meek, than to furnish you with gifts, and make you free in speech.
   Again, he is not the best Christian that hath most fanatical raptures
   of joy, or pretended admirations of grace; but he that is crucified to
   the world, and hath felt the power of Christ's death. Many who are not
   careful, watchful, and exact in their conversations, yet will pretend
   to live upon Christ, and think they need not be so scrupulous to be
   troubled about their sins. These neglect the main end of Christ's
   coming, which was to turn every one of us from our iniquities.

   4. It shows the necessity and excellency of holiness. The necessity of
   it will appear thus:--It is not only an evidence of our interest in the
   relative privileges, such as pardon, adoption, and the like; not only
   necessary by way of gratitude for salvation received, but it is
   necessary as a part of salvation itself. This is the salvation, the
   blessing of the Redeemer, this is the thing wherein he hath showed his
   free grace, in that he hath purchased the Spirit to heal our natures,
   and restore the image of God to us which was defaced by sin. Herein is
   Christ a Saviour, in saving his people from their sins, and he hath
   saved us by washing us in the laver of regeneration.' And once more, it
   is not only a main part of our salvation, but a necessary means to
   obtain the rest. No obtaining pardon without conversion, nor heaven
   till sin be quite done away. Secondly, The excellency of holiness
   appears. For this end we are redeemed by Christ, Luke i. 74, 75. And
   renewed by the Holy Ghost, Eph. iv. 24. Yea, our everlasting
   blessedness consists in the perfection of holiness, Eph. v. 27.

   It informs us how much Christians are to blame, that they improve their
   Christianity no more to get power and strength against sin. Christ,
   consider him as a prophet, priest, or king, doth still discover himself
   to be one that came to take away sin. As a prophet, he hath given us
   such a doctrine as is fit for such a use, John xvii. 17. His word is
   the best glass to see corruption. The highest motives in the world are
   propounded to purge it out His calls, promises, and threats are all to
   take away sin; and as a priest, he hath paid the price that was
   necessary to preserve the honour of God's justice, that there might be
   no stop in the way of that abundant grace, and that we may have the
   gift of the Spirit, 1 John i. 7. Because his blood was that meritorious
   price that was shed, that we might be turned from sin, and this blood
   is pleaded before God, He lives for ever to make intercession for you,'
   that in all your conflicts and temptations you may have necessary
   strength against sin. As a king, he doth powerfully by his Spirit
   maintain his interest against the devil, world, and flesh, and helps
   you to overcome sin. He is the captain of your salvation.' Yet
   lamentable it is to see what a poor cowardly spirit is in most
   Christians, how soon captivated with every slender assault and petty
   temptation, and their resolutions so soon shaken, not so much for want
   of strength, as sluggishness and cowardice, and want of care. Men spare
   their pains, and then cry out they are impotent, when there is such
   grace provided in the Redeemer. Like lazy beggars that personate and
   act diseases because they would not work, they are not able to stand
   before the slightest motions of sin, because they do not stir up
   themselves and improve the grace they have, or might have by Christ.
   Certainly idle complaints of sin will not become those that profess an
   interest in Christ, for his main great undertaking, which is by all
   methods carried on still, is the taking away sin. So much for the
   information.

   II. Take home with you this truth in your hearts, that Christ's work is
   to turn you from sin, and it is the great blessing we have from him in
   the new covenant. Then do not neglect this work, nor contemn this
   blessing. You know the fault of those, they made light of these things.
   Especially do not resist this work, nor grieve the Holy Spirit of
   Christ which would work it in you, and quench not his sanctifying
   motions; rather deliver up yourselves to all his healing methods, and
   be so far from resisting, that you should improve the power of his
   grace every day. He turns us indeed by way of efficiency, but we turn
   ourselves by submission to his blessed motions. He draws, and we run
   after him. Therefore, every time Christ offers this saving help, thou
   art put to thy choice, whether thou wilt have Christ or sin to reign
   over thee. Christ, that doeth it for thee, must do it in thee. Christ
   is the author that turns, but the sinner is the subject, and he first
   works upon you, and afterwards he works by you. He converts you to God
   by the victorious impressions of his grace, and afterwards, ye through
   the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body.' We cannot do it; Christ
   must do it, but he will do it in his own way. He hath sanctified
   ordinances to convey this to you. Now, wilt thou wait diligently till
   it be accomplished? The physician cures the disease, but the patient
   must take the appointed medicine. You must not expect he should cure
   it, and thou feel it not, as it were by spells and charms without thee,
   without putting thee to the trouble of physic. Take up a resolution to
   look after the cure of thy soul, and observe the whole progress of the
   work, and what a wound is given to sin in every ordinance: what in the
   word, what in the Lord's Supper; how thy resolution is strengthened
   against it; how the carnal nature wears off every day. The work is not
   perfect in an instant, but he is still turning; therefore when thou
   beginnest to be dead to sin, die more. Ye are dead, therefore mortify.
   Christ hath perfectly bought off all sin in every kind and degree;
   should not we strive to have all that he hath purchased? At least do
   not strengthen thy bonds, the sin thou canst not avoid hate it, and
   keep up the lively resistance still. Hear diligently, pray earnestly,
   watch narrowly, and keep thyself from thy sin: do not only pare the
   nails of it, but cut off thy very right hand, and mortify and subdue it
   yet more and more, that Christ may have his conquest in thy soul.

SERMON IV.

   Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that
   by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped
   the corruption that is in the world through lust.--2 Pet. I. 4.

   IN these words the apostle extolleth the grace of God towards us in the
   gospel. In them take notice of:--

   First, The means.

   Secondly, The end and use of them.

   Thirdly, The method and order in which this effect is wrought in us.

   First, The means whereby God conveys his grace to us, viz., the
   promises of the gospel, which are set forth:--

   1. By their excellency: exceeding great and precious promises.

   2. Their freeness: are given to us.

   1. Their excellency is set forth by two adjuncts. They are exceeding
   great and precious:' ta megista kai timia epangelmata. The one noteth
   their intrinsic worth and value; they are exceeding great.' The other,
   our esteem of them; they deserve to be precious' to us.

   [1.] Ta megista, so called from the matter of them, which are great and
   precious gifts, such as pardon, and life begun in sanctification and
   perfected in glory.

   [2.] Ta timia epangelmata, precious, deserving and challenging our
   esteem, being so suitable to our necessities and desires. Our necessity
   ariseth from the fears of misery so justly deserved. Our desires are
   after a proper happiness, which is only offered to us in the promises
   of God, not only as probable, but as certain to be ours, if duly
   qualified. Now these promises, being so great and precious, should
   attract us to all purity and holiness; for what is greater, and
   deserveth to be more esteemed by us, than remission of sins, and an
   inheritance among the sanctified?

   2. Their freeness: given, made freely, made good freely.

   Secondly, The end and use of them: that by these ye might be partakers
   of the divine nature.

   By the divine nature is not meant here the essence of God, but his
   communicable excellencies, or such divine properties as can be imparted
   to the creature, and these not considered in their absolute perfection,
   but as they are agreeable to our present state and capacity. These are
   sometimes called the image of God:' Col. iii. 10, The new man, which is
   renewed in holiness after the image of him that created him;' because
   they imply a likeness to him. And sometimes the life of God:' Eph. iv.
   18, Being alienated from the life of God,' because it is a vital
   principle. And here the divine nature,' and that for two reasons:--

   1. Because these are communicated to us by God; they are created in us
   by his divine power, and therefore the word created is so often used on
   this occasion: Eph. ii. 10, We are his workmanship, created in Christ
   Jesus;' 2 Cor. v. 17, If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.'
   Creation is proper to God. We have them by virtue of our communion with
   him. They flow from God, as the light doth from the sun.

   2. Because by these perfections we somewhat resemble God. Therefore it
   is said, 1 Peter ii. 9, We show forth his praises: ta`s areta's, his
   virtues or divine attributes, his wisdom, goodness, bounty, holiness;'
   for in these we most resemble him. If you take in his power, there is
   some resemblance of that too, as to the moral exercise in taming our
   own flesh, mastering our inordinate lusts and passions, and vanquishing
   all temptations. This is a spiritual power, and so spoken of Prov. xvi.
   32, He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
   ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.' And pa'nta ischu'o, I
   can do all things through Christ that strengthens me,' Phil. iv. 13. To
   live above the hopes and fears of the world is a great ability and
   power. And vanquishing the world is made the fruit of the new birth: 1
   John v. 4, That which is born of God overcometh the world.' And in that
   place where the spirit of a Christian is described, it is said to be a
   spirit of love, power, and of a sound mind,' 2 Tim. i. 7. We conceive
   God to be a spiritual being, of in finite wisdom, goodness, and power.
   To his wisdom answereth the spirit of a sound mind; to his goodness, a
   spirit of love; and what is the original and pattern of the spirit of
   power, the very name discovereth, namely, God's own power. So all his
   attributes leave their impress upon us.

   Thirdly, The way, method, and order how we receive this benefit of the
   divine nature. Having first escaped the corruption that is in the world
   through lust.' As we die to sin, the divine nature increaseth in us.
   There is a putting off before there can be a putting on: Eph. iv.
   22-24, We put off the old man, which is corrupt by its deceitful
   lusts.' We begin the work of sanctification with mortification in the
   first place, and then proceed to the positive duties of a new life; for
   the plants of righteousness will not thrive in an impenitent and
   unmortified heart. As the corruption of sin is driven out and expelled,
   so the divine nature succeedeth. Intus existens prohibet alienum, these
   things are not consistent, cannot be joined together. The corruption
   that is in the world and the divine nature can no more agree than
   darkness and light, Rom. xiii. 12. But let us see how this
   mortification is expressed.

   1. What is to be avoided.

   2. The manner of shunning it.

   1. What is to be avoided: The corruption that is in the world through
   lust.' Observe, sin is called corruption, as often in scripture,
   because it is a blasting of our primitive excellency and purity; Gen.
   vi. 12, All flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth;' Ps. xiv. 1,
   They are all corrupt and abominable;' that is, degenerated, fallen from
   their pristine or former purity. Observe, the seat of this corruption
   is said to be in the world, where lust and all uncleanness reigneth;
   therefore called mia'smata ko'smou, the pollutions of the world,' 2
   Peter ii. 20. The generality of men are defiled with them, corrupted in
   their faith, worship, and manners; therefore conversion is called for
   under these terms: Acts ii. 40, Save yourselves from this untoward
   generation.' Conversion to God implies a renouncing or an escaping the
   evil fashions and corruptions of the world, or having no fellowship
   with them,' with their sins, but reproving them rather.' So that the
   question is, whether we will conform ourselves to God or the world?
   whether we will have fellowship with the corruptions of the world, or
   be partakers of the divine nature? We must avoid the one to obtain the
   other. Lastly, observe, that this corruption is said to reign in the
   world through lust.' Besides the bait there is the appetite; it is our
   naughty affections that make our abode in the world unsafe and
   dangerous. If it were not for lust, neither the baits nor the examples
   of the world would pervert or hurt. Mortify the lust, and you have
   pulled up the temptations by the roots.

   2. The manner of shunning, in the word escaping. There is a flying away
   required, and that quickly, as in the plague, cito longe; or from a
   fire which hath almost burned us, or a flood that breaketh in upon us.
   We cannot soon enough escape from sin: Mat. iii. 7, Who hath warned you
   to flee from the wrath to come;' Heb. vi. 18, Who have fled for
   refuge,' &c. No motion but flight becomes us in this case.

   Doct. That the great end and effect of the promises of the gospel is,
   to make us partakers of the divine nature.

   I. Let us consider the effect or end.

   II. The means appointed to attain it.

   III. The influence of the one on the other.

   I. For the effect or end. There observe:--

   1. That it is a natural, not a transient effect. There may be such a
   sense of the goodness, wisdom, and power of God as may produce a sudden
   passion; as suppose of fear or love. It may only affect us for the
   present, but inferreth no change of heart and life. There is an
   impression we cannot deny, and an impression suitable to those
   apprehensions that we have of God; but it is not a constant principle
   of holy spiritual operation. But the promises of the gospel are to
   breed in us such a temper of heart as may be a second nature to us, a
   habit or constitution of soul that may incline us to live to God. A
   habit serveth for this use, ut quis facile, jucunde et constanter agat,
   that a man may act easily, pleasantly, and constantly. (1.) To act
   easily. There is an inclination and propensity to holiness. God created
   all things with an inclination to their proper operations, as air to
   ascend, and water to descend. So the new creature hath a tendency to
   those actions that are proper to it. Their hearts are bent to please
   God and serve him, and do whatever they do with a kind of naturalness,
   because of this bent and inclination. They act not only or barely as
   enjoined, but as inclined. The law of God is in their hearts, Heb.
   viii. 10. So act .not by constraint, but with a ready mind. (2.) To act
   pleasantly. They have not only a new bent, bias, and tendency, but it
   is a delight to do what is holy, Ps. xl. 8, as being in their element
   when they are thus employed. What is against nature is ingrate and
   harsh, but what is with nature is sweet and pleasant. It is hard, a
   kind of force, to bring them to do the contrary, 1 John iii. 9. There
   needeth some kind of violence to bring a good man to sin, as also a
   naughty man to do good. (3.) It is a constant principle of holy
   operations, so that a man doth not only obey God easily, but evenly,
   and without such frequent interruptions of the holy life. Many do that
   which is good, or forbear evil, uneasily, be cause of the restraints of
   providence or dictates of conscience, and unevenly by fits and starts:
   Ps. cvi. 3, Blessed is he that keepeth judgment, and doth righteousness
   at all times.' They are continually exercising of all duties of
   godliness, righteousness and mercy; for the operations of nature are
   constant, however impeded, obstructed, or diverted at certain times.
   This we are to look after, that the sanctifying grace we have received
   become a new nature; that the soul have a tendency and delight as to
   spiritual objects, and be constantly and easily carried to them, and
   this should be the whole frame and drift of our lives.

   2. It is a divine nature; that is, not only such as floweth from God,
   but may carry some resemblance with him or to him. It floweth from God,
   for we are partakers;' it is but a ray from his excellency, and it
   carrieth a likeness to him, or cometh nearer to the nature of God
   himself, than anything that a man is capable of. Now this is said for
   two reasons:--

   [1.] To show the dignity of it. Nothing known to man is so like God as
   a sanctified soul. The saints have their Maker's express image;
   therefore if God be excellent and holy, they are so. The image and
   picture of God and Christ is in them, not made by a painter or carver,
   but by the Holy Ghost, 2 Cor. iii. 18. This is not a forbidden image,
   which may pollute and stain our minds, or form in us ill thoughts and
   conceptions of God, but raise our hearts to him. Natural conscience
   doth homage to the image of God shining in the saints: Mark vi. 20,
   Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and a holy.' So of
   Moses it is said, Exod. xi. 3, Moses was a great man in the land of
   Egypt, and in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of all
   people.' His person and presence was awful to them, as having something
   rare in it. There is a secret sentiment of the excellency of holiness
   that draweth eyes after it, and maketh wicked and carnal men wonder at
   it, stand in awe of those in whom it is eminent, and extorteth a
   reverence from them. But especially when they come to die they have a
   sense of this excellency; all then approve a sober, righteous, and
   godly life, and disallow that which is dissolute and carnal. Then all
   things appear in their own colours, and the fumes of lust being
   dissipated, they begin more clearly to discern the happiness of those
   who are made like God. Then those that would live with the carnal would
   fain die with the righteous: Num. xxiii. 10, Let my last end be like
   his.' When entering on the confines of eternity they grow wiser.

   [2.] To show the quality and condition of it. You must have a new
   nature, and such a nature as may be a divine nature. If you have
   nothing above natural men or corrupt nature, you are strangers to the
   promises of the gospel. It is a thought that possesseth many when they
   are pressed to Christian duties, they will say, we are not saints or
   angels, and therefore cannot abstain from such sins, or attain unto a
   heavenly life. But do you mark what is said here: Christians must be
   partakers of a divine nature; and not only they are cut off from any
   privilege by Christ who corrupt themselves as brute beasts, made to be
   taken and destroyed,' Jude 10--that is, against the light of nature
   ingulf themselves in all manner of dissoluteness and sensuality; but
   also they that walk as men, only according to the rule of men, who mind
   nothing beyond the present world: 1 Cor. iii. 3, Are not ye carnal, and
   walk as men?'--that is, they are not raised above the pitch of mere
   men, and have nothing of the Spirit of God in them.

   [3.] This divine nature may be considered three ways. Either--

   (1.) As begun; when we are first renewed in the spirit of our minds,'
   and regenerated according to the image of God,' Eph. iv. 23, 24. There
   is a wonderful change wrought in sinners by reason of the divine
   qualities impressed on them; so that the creature beginneth to look
   like God himself: their nature is altered, their course of life is
   altered, and their designs and actions have something divine in them.

   (2.) As increased; when more like God in a conspicuous degree. At first
   the impression is but weak, and this glory is darkened by remaining
   imperfections; and we show forth much of Adam upon all occasions, as
   well as somewhat of Christ. But where any are sincere and diligent, the
   old nature is more suppressed and curbed, and the divine nature doth
   more eminently appear: 2 Cor. iii. 18, We are changed from glory to
   glory.' It is a work capable of spiritual progress. We should grow more
   like God, and come nearer to the nature of God every day; and it is a
   shame we are not, having been so long acquainted with the word.

   (3.) As it is perfected in heaven; for there we have the nearest
   communion with God, and so the highest conformity to him that we are
   capable of: 1 John iii. 2, We shall see God as he is, and be like him.'
   Perfectly like him; for the being of sin is then utterly abolished:
   there is not the least stain or blemish upon a glorified soul. Besides,
   then we are like him, not only in point of holiness, but in point of
   happiness and felicity; for God is a holy and happy being. Here we
   resemble God more in holiness and purity; for many times the most
   eminent and exemplary holiness may be accompanied with remarkable
   afflictions; at least, sanctifying grace doth not exempt us from them.
   But there, as our holiness is exact, our felicity is complete also.
   First we are made holy, and then immortal, and in both like God. Well,
   then, this is the effect, partakers of a divine nature;' so that when
   you come among the people of God, and you be asked what kind of men do
   you find them to be, as Gideon, in another case, asked Zeba and
   Zalmunnah concerning his brethren, who answered, Each one resembled the
   children of a king,' Judges viii. 18, they were godly [16] and
   majestical persons,--so it will be said concerning the saints, who are
   really and eminently partakers of the grace of the gospel: they are all
   children of the most high God; as like God as mortal men can be,--bear
   his image, and express resemblance of the grace of the gospel.

   II. Let us now see the means by which God doth accomplish this effect:
   To us are given great and precious promises.'

   1. It is an instance of God's love, that he will deal with us in the
   way of promises. The world is depraved by sin, and sunk into fears and
   despair of any good from God, whom we have so highly provoked.
   Therefore God invites and allures us to himself by promises; for
   promises and [17] declarations of God's will in the gospel, whereby he
   signifies what good he will freely bestow us, if we will look after it.
   These ad vantages we have by them:--(1.) A promise is more than a
   purpose; for the purpose and intention of a man is secret and hidden in
   his own bosom, but a promise is open and manifest. Thereby we get the
   knowledge of the good intended to us. If God had only purposed to
   bestow all his grace upon us, we could not have known his intention and
   purpose till it were manifested in the effect; it would have been as a
   hidden treasure or sealed fountain, of no comfort and encouragement to
   us till we had found it. But now the word is gone out of his lips, we
   may know how we shall speed, if we will hearken to his counsel. God's
   promises are, on his part, the eruption or overflow of his love. His
   heart is so big with thoughts of good to us, that his love cannot stay
   till the accomplishment of things, but he must tell us aforehand: Isa.
   xlii. 9, Before they spring forth, I tell you of them.' He might have
   done us good, and given us no notice; but that would not satisfy him.
   It is an obligation God takes upon himself, promittendo, se debitorem
   fecit. God's purposes are unchangeable, but promises are a security put
   into our hands, not only give us notice, but assurance that thus it
   shall be. We have the greater holdfast upon him, and may put his bond
   in suit: Ps. cxix. 49, Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which
   thou hast caused me to hope.' (2.) It is more than a doctrinal
   declaration. It is one thing to reveal a doctrine, another to promise a
   benefit; that maketh a thing known, this maketh a thing sure, and upon
   certain terms; that gives us notice, but this gives us interest. If
   life and immortality' had been only brought to light in the gospel,' 2
   Tim. i. 10, which was only obscurely known to the heathens, it were a
   great mercy that we were not left to blind guesses and dark
   conjectures. That eternal life is set before us, a thing real and
   excellent, is a great matter. But God hath put it into a covenant form
   and promise, 1 John ii. 25, that we may make our title and our claim.
   Surely that is matter of great comfort to us: Ps. cxix. 111, Thy
   testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever; for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart.' (3.) It is more than a prophecy or simple
   prediction. Scripture prophecies will be fulfilled because of God's
   veracity; but scripture promises will be fulfilled, not only because of
   God's veracity, but also his fidelity and justice; for by God's promise
   man cometh to have a right to the thing promised. It was his mercy and
   goodness to make the promise, but his justice and fidelity bindeth him
   to make it good: 1 John i. 9, If we confess our sins, he is faithful
   and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness;' 2 Tim. iv. 8. Divines say, of all lies, a promissory
   lie is the worst; for this is not only against truth, but right, even
   though that right entirely accrueth from your own free promise.

   2. The promises of the new covenant are of a most glorious and valuable
   nature. They are not about small things, or things of little moment,
   but about worthy and dear-bought blessings. They contain spiritual and
   eternal riches; such as the healing of our nature, the pardon of our
   sins, a safe conduct unto eternal happiness; the glorifying of our
   souls, the resurrection of our bodies, and then life everlasting, or an
   unchangeable state of happiness. These are the greatest things indeed,
   in comparison of which all the things of the world are but as a
   May-game, vain and empty, or the smallest matters, as the apostle
   calleth them, 1 Cor. vi. 2. Reconciliation with God is our privilege
   here; and is it a light thing to be at peace with the living God? to
   enjoy his amity and love? to study and fit ourselves to do his will? to
   live in constant communion with him now? to have access to him at all
   times? to obtain from him whatever in reason and righteousness we can
   ask? A Christian is never upbraided with the perpetuity of addresses,
   never denied audience, never has cause to doubt of success, has more
   familiarity with God, and a surer interest in his love, than the
   greatest favourites have in any prince or potentate upon earth. But
   then the eternal enjoyment of God hereafter: Phil. iii. 14, I press
   towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling in God in Christ
   Jesus.' It is a high prize that is set before us; then we shall have a
   larger capacity to know God, and enjoy him, and receive his benefits:
   Ps. xvii. 15, As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I
   shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.' Oh! cry out: 1 Cor.
   ii. 9, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
   heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love
   him.'

   3. They are precious promises, worthy of our esteem; for they are not
   about things that we have nothing to do with, but such wherein we are
   deeply and intimately concerned. In God's promises there is due
   provision made for the desires, necessities, and wants of mankind. Let
   me instance in pardon and life, the first inviting benefits, Acts xx
   vi. 18. Pardon answereth the fears, and life those desires of happiness
   which are so natural to us.

   [1.] The consciousness of sin, and the fear of God's wrath and
   displeasure, should make offers of pardon acceptable to us. The great
   scruple of the guilty creature is how sin shall be expiated and God
   appeased, Micah vi. 6, 7. We fear punishment from a holy and just God,
   and cannot get rid of bondage till sin be forgiven. The justice of the
   supreme governor of the world will be ever dreadful to us. The gospel
   serveth for this use, to give us the knowledge of salvation by the
   remission of sins, Luke i. 77.

   [2.] The other great privilege is eternal life. Corrupt nature is not
   against the offers of felicity. There was never a creature heard of
   that would not be happy, for there was never a creature but loved
   himself. Therefore what more powerful inducement to bring us into the
   way of holiness than this blessed hope set before us, that we may see
   God, and live for ever? Titus ii. 12, 13. It is true, we are greatly
   enchanted with false happiness, but shall not such an offer be precious
   to us? John vi. 34, Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us
   this bread.'

   4. All this is given to us wretched men without any desert of ours;
   nay, we had deserved the contrary. Without our asking or thinking, the
   covenant was framed and modelled to our hands, and in the frame and
   contexture of it we may see a constant strain of covenant grace, in the
   richness of the benefits, the graciousness of the donor, the
   seasonableness of the offer, the readiness of the help, when once we
   set ourselves to seek after God, and please and serve him; and, lastly,
   in the sureness of the reward, notwithstanding frailties and
   imperfections.

   III. The influence of the one upon the other; or, how do these promises
   promote the divine nature?

   1. From their drift, which is, to draw us from the creature to God, and
   the world to heaven; to mortify the esteem of the false happiness which
   tainteth and corrupteth our natures; and to raise us to those noble
   objects and ends which dignify and adorn the soul, and make it in a
   sort divine. It breedeth an excellent spirit in us, which is carried
   above the world, and the hopes and fears of it, 1 Cor. ii. 12. Alas!
   what a mean spirit have they that drive no higher trade than providing
   for the flesh, or accommodating a life which must shortly expire! Like
   foolish birds who, with great art and contrivance, feather a nest,
   which within a little while they leave. But how divine and god-like are
   they who look to higher things, to please God, enjoy communion with
   him, and live with him for ever!

   2. The matter of the promises. Many of which concern the change of our
   hearts, the cleansing or healing of our natures: Heb. viii. 10, I will
   put my laws in their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will
   be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;' Ezek. xxxvi. 25,
   26, Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean;
   from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A
   new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you;
   and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give
   you a heart of flesh;' Jer. xxxiii. 8, And I will cleanse them from all
   their iniquity.' All which are encouragements of prayer to God for this
   benefit. If God doth not exclude us, we should not exclude ourselves.

   3. The conditions or terms on which our right is suspended. Not pardon
   without repentance: Acts iii. 19, Repent ye therefore, and be
   converted, that your sins might be blotted out, when the times of
   refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; Acts ii. 38, 39,
   Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
   for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
   Ghost,' &c. Not heaven or eternal life without holiness: Heb. xii. 14,
   Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
   the Lord;' Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,' Mat.
   v. 8.

   4. The power with which the promises are accompanied: 2 Peter i. 3,
   According as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain
   unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called
   us to glory and virtue.' He gives us life temporal and spiritual, and
   that immutable life of felicity hereafter. The divine nature is
   communicated to us by virtue of the promises; for the Spirit is our
   sanctifier, and he works by congruous means.

   Use 1. Believe the promises, for they are most sure and certain. God's
   testimony of the good things he will bestow upon us cannot deceive us,
   or beget a vain and uncertain hope. His promise is a testimony of his
   will, and against his power nothing can stand. There shall be a
   performance of those things spoken of by the Lord,' Luke i. 45.

   2. Esteem them: Heb. xi. 13, These all died in faith, not having
   received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were
   persuaded of them, and embraced them.' We can never embrace them till
   we are persuaded of their truth. But then consider their worth. Great
   is the stupidity of those who are nothing taken with these things. If a
   great man engages himself any way, we make great reckoning of his word;
   and shall we not make great matter of the word of God, and esteem his
   promises? Esteem them so as to get them at any price, Mat. xiii. 46.
   Sell all for the pearl of price. Esteem them so as to be contented with
   a mean condition in the world. Though God keeps us low, it is enough to
   be made partakers of his holiness:' Heb. xii. 10, For they verily for a
   few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit,
   that we might be partakers of his holiness.' Esteem them so as to
   perform the duties required, Ps. cxix. 14; esteem them so as to keep up
   your rejoicing in Christ: Phil. iii. 8-10, I count all things but loss
   for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord;' and ver.
   3, We are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
   rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.'

   3. Labour to improve the belief of every promise for the increase of
   holiness, that we may be like God, pure and holy as he is: 2 Cor. vii.
   1, Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God.'

SERMON V.

   For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be
   salted with salt.--Mark IX. 49.

   IN the context you have a caution which our Lord gives against scandals
   and offences given to others, either by defection from the truth, or by
   a sinful conversation. And--

   1. He intimates the cause of these scandals, which is some beloved
   lust; and that is better mortified than satisfied. There is something
   precious, profitable, and pleasant in our opinion, estimation, and
   affection, that calls us from God, and the duties we owe to him, and
   apprehended by us as so necessary for us, that we can no more spare it
   than a right eye, a right hand, or a right foot.

   2. Our Lord compares the loss of satisfaction in such lusts with the
   danger of perishing for ever; and shows that (all things considered) it
   were better to be deprived of this profit, pleasure, or honour, than to
   lose eternal life, and run the hazard of eternal death. Either that
   pleasure or lust must be denied, or we perish for ever. The right hand
   must be cut off, or else we shall be cast into hell-fire.

   3. Our Lord shows the danger of perishing for ever, amplified by a
   notable description, Their worm never dies, and their fire shall never
   be quenched.' The scripture lisps to us in our own dialect, and speaks
   in such notions we can best understand, and therefore represents the
   state of the damned by what is terrible to sense. By the worm is meant
   the anguish of conscience, by fire the wrath of God. Memoria
   praeteritorum, sensus presentium, metus futurorum. The torment of the
   wicked arises partly from, their own consciences. There is a vexing
   remembrance of what is past, their folly in the neglect of grace; and
   there is a bitter sense of that doleful state into which they have now
   plunged themselves, and a fear of what is yet to come. Now, beside this
   remorse for their folly, there is also a fire that shall never be
   quenched,' or the sharp torments that are prepared for the wicked.

   4. Here is a collation or comparison of opposites--the pains of hell,
   with the trouble of mortification. First or last we must endure
   troubles and difficulties. Now it is much more eligible to take pains
   in the mortifying of sin, than to bear eternal pains in the punishment
   of it. This is that which is expressed in the text, For every one shall
   be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.' In
   the words--

   1. Observe, a double salting, either with fire or with salt; the one
   referring to one sort of people, and the other to the other. They agree
   in the common nature: for salt is of a fiery nature, and apt to
   consume; but they differ in the matter to be consumed, Salt consumes
   the superfluous moisture, which is apt to cause putrefaction; but the
   fire consumes the substance itself; so that to be salted with fire is
   to be given up to everlasting destruction. Fire consumeth all things;
   and God is called a consuming fire to the wicked, Heb. xii. 29.

   2. Here is also an allusion to sacrifices; for every man that lives in
   the world must be a sacrifice to God. The wicked are a sacrifice to
   God's justice; but the godly are a sacrifice dedicated and offered to
   him, that they may be capable of his mercy. The first are a sacrifice
   against their wills, but the godly are a free-will offering, a
   sacrifice not taken but offered. Now, the law of all sacrifices was,
   that they were to be salted with salt: Lev. ii. 13, And every oblation
   of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou
   suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat
   offering; with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.' Three times
   it is repeated there, to show that every sacrifice must be salted. That
   the wicked, the objects of God's vindictive justice, are accounted
   sacrifices, is evident by scripture. When the destruction of Moab is
   spoken of: Isa. xxxiv. 6, The sword of the Lord is filled with blood,
   it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, and
   with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in
   Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.' So Jer. xlvi. 10,
   God threatens there that the sword shall devour, and be made drunk with
   their blood, For the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north
   country, by the river Euphrates.' What is in these places called a
   slaughter is also called a sacrifice. So when God intended a great
   carnage of his enemies, he calls upon the fowls of heaven, Ezek. xxxix.
   17, Assemble yourselves, and come to my sacrifice;' with an allusion to
   the beasts offered in sacrifice. This may be gathered from the
   signification of the sacrifices, the burnt-offerings especially, which
   signified the guilt of the sinner; the death of Christ, which is the
   propitiation for sin; and the obedience of the sacrificer, as devoted
   to God. Now the first signification took place, and had its effect upon
   them, if they neglected the other two meanings of the sacrifices; and
   therefore they were to be looked on as salted with fire; whereas the
   other, who were accepted, were salted with salt.

   3. The third observation for the opening of this is the two references
   of these saltings, or the distinct and proper application of them.

   [1.] To the wicked: For every one shall be salted with fire;' that is,
   every one of them spoken of before, who indulged their corrupt
   affections, who did not entirely and heartily keep the covenant of God,
   and renounce their beloved lusts.

   [2.] Here is the application to the godly: Every sacrifice shall be
   salted with salt;' that is, every one that is not a sacrifice by
   constraint, but voluntarily surrenders and gives up himself to God, to
   be ordered and disposed of according to his will, he is salted, not
   with fire, but with salt, which every one that is devoted to God is
   bound to have within himself. So while some are destinated to the wrath
   of God, and salted with fire to be consumed and destroyed, others are
   salted with salt, preserved and kept savoury in the profession and
   practice of godliness. The doctrine is this:--

   Doct. The grace of mortification is very necessary for all those who
   are devoted to God.

   I shall prove three things:--

   I. That the true notion of a Christian is, that he is a sacrifice, or a
   thank-offering to God.

   II. That the grace of mortification is the true salt, whereby this
   offering and sacrifice should be seasoned.

   III. I shall show you the necessity of this salt, that we may keep
   right with God in the duties of the covenant.

   I. The true notion of a Christian is, that he is a sacrifice to God.
   This is evident by Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies
   of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, acceptable
   unto God, which is your reasonable service;' that is, the reasonable
   part, which was figured by the sacrifices and oblations of the law: and
   so Isa. lxvi. 20, They shall bring your brethren for an offering unto
   the Lord.' Under the law, beasts were offered to God, but in the gospel
   men are offered to him; not as beasts were to be destroyed, slain, and
   burnt in the fire, but to be preserved for God's use and service. In
   offering anything to God, two things were of consideration; there was a
   separation from a common, and a dedication to a holy use, and they both
   take place in the present matter.

   1. There is a separation of ourselves from a common use. The beast was
   separated from the flock or herd for this special purpose, to be given
   to God. Thus we are separated and set apart from the rest of the world,
   that we may be a people to God. We are no more our own,' 1 Cor. vi. 19;
   and we are no more to live to ourselves, but to him that died for us,'
   2 Cor. v. 15. We are not to live to the world, to the flesh, or to such
   things as the natural heart craves; we have no right in ourselves to
   dispose of ourselves, of our time, of our interest, of our strength,
   but must wholly give up ourselves to God, to be disposed, ordered,
   governed by him at his own will and pleasure.

   2. There is a dedication of ourselves to God, to serve, please, honour,
   and glorify him.

   [l.] The manner of dedicating ourselves to God is to be considered. It
   is usually done with grief, shame, and indignation at ourselves, that
   God hath been so long kept out of his right, with a full purpose to
   restore it to him with advantage: 1 Pet. iv. 3, The time past may
   suffice to have wrought the will of the flesh, and of man;' it is high
   time to give up ourselves to the will of God; we have been long enough,
   too long, dishonouring God, destroying our souls, pleasing the flesh,
   living according to the flesh and the course of the world; therefore
   they desire to make restitution: Rom. vi. 19, For as ye have yielded
   your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity;
   even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
   holiness.' Their forepast neglects of God and duty to him fill their
   hearts with shame, therefore they resolve to double their diligence,
   and to be as eminent in holiness as before they were in vanity and sin.

   [2.] It is with a deep sense of the Lord's love in Christ; for we give
   up ourselves to God, not as a sin-offering, but as a thank-offering:
   Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you by the mercies of the Lord;' and 2 Cor. v.
   14, For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that
   if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that
   they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   him that died for them, and rose again.' They are ravished with an
   admiration of God's goodness in Christ, and so give up themselves to
   him.

   [3.] They do entirely give up themselves to God, not to be his in a few
   things, but in all, to serve him with all their faculties: You are not
   your own, but are bought with a price; therefore glorify God both with
   your bodies and souls, which are God's,' 1 Cor. vi. 20; and to serve
   him in all conditions: Rom. xiv. 8, Whether we live, we live unto God,
   or whether we die, we die unto God; for living or dying we are the
   Lord's.' They are willing to be used for his glory, not only as active
   instruments; but as passive objects, they give up themselves to obey
   his governing will, and to submit to his disposing will, to be what he
   would have them to be, as well as to do what he would have them to do:
   Phil. i. 20, According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in
   nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so
   now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or
   by death.' Thus with all their faculties, in every condition of life,
   are they to be devoted to God in all actions. It is said, Zech. xiv.
   20, 21, that holiness to the Lord shall be written,' not only upon the
   bowels of the altar and the pots of the Lord's house,' but also upon
   all the pots of Jerusalem;' not only upon the vessels of the temple,
   but upon common utensils; that is, translate it into a gospel phrase,
   that not only in our sacred, but even in our common and civil actions,
   &c., we should live as a people that are offered up to God.

   [4.] The end why we give up ourselves to God is to serve, please, and
   glorify him: Acts xxvii. 23, His I am, and him I serve;' to please him
   by the obedience of his will: Rom. xii. 1,2, Ye present your bodies a
   living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by
   the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and
   acceptable and perfect will of God;' Col. i. 10, That ye might walk
   worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
   work.' And also to glorify him is their end and use. Phil. i. 21, 1
   Cor. x. 31. This is the dedication by which a Christian becomes a
   spiritual and a holy sacrifice unto God. Now we must be sincere and
   real in this, partly--

   (1.) Because the truth of our dedication will be known by our use: many
   give up themselves to God, but in the use of themselves there is no
   such matter; they carry it as though their tongues were their own, and
   had no Lord over them, Ps. xii. 4. They speak what they please; they
   use their hearts as their own, to think and covet what they please;
   their hands as their own, to do what they please; their bodies as their
   own, to prostitute them to all excess and filthiness; and their wealth
   and strength and time as their own, either to spare it, or lavish it
   according as their lusts guide and incline them. No, no; a sincere
   Christian makes conscience of his dedication to God, the reality and
   sincerity of it is seen in the use of themselves, and if he be tempted
   to do anything contrary to this vow and dedication, his heart riseth
   against the temptation: 1 Cor. vi. 15, Shall I take the members of
   Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid.' In point of
   fidelity to God, as we are in covenant with him, we must be careful
   that we employ and use what is God's for the glory of God; we must make
   conscience of alienating that that is sacred, that that is the Lord's:
   your thoughts, your affections, your time, your strength, do all belong
   to him.

   (2.) Because God will one day call us to an account: Luke xix. 23, He
   will demand his own with usury.' We shall be called to a reckoning,
   what we have done for God, what part and portion he hath had in our
   time, our strength, our parts, our interest; therefore every prudent
   and wise Christian should himself keep a faithful and constant
   reckoning how he lays out himself for God, for he must have a share in
   all things that we have or do.

   (3.) We must be very sincere in this, because we are under the eye and
   inspection of God, who considers whose business we do, his or our own:
   Luke i. 75, That we should serve him in holiness and righteousness
   before him all the days of our life.' We are ever before him, and
   though he doth not presently call us to an account, yet many times now
   he punisheth us for our neglect and mindlessness of his interest: Ezek.
   xvi. 8, Ye entered into a covenant with me, and became mine.' That was
   the reason of his judgments against them. When those that are his do
   not carry themselves as his, when that that is sacred is profaned by a
   common use, then a judgment is coming upon a nation, if dedicated to
   God, and it warps from him, or upon a person, if his ways be not
   upright with him.

   II. The next thing I am to do is to prove that the grace of
   mortification is the true salt wherewith this offering and sacrifice
   should be seasoned. There is some dispute what is meant by the salt
   which Christ recommends to his disciples, and what was figured by the
   salt in the sacrifice, whether wisdom or zeal. In general, it is the
   grace of the Holy Spirit, by which sin is subdued and prevented; and
   the meaning suits exactly with the emblem and representation: for--

   1. Salt preserves flesh from putrefaction by consuming that superfluous
   and excrementitious moisture, which otherwise would soon corrupt; and
   so the salt of the covenant doth prevent and subdue those lusts which
   would cause us to deal unfaithfully with God. Alas! meat is not so apt
   to be tainted as we are to be corrupted and weakened in our resolutions
   to God, without the mortifying grace of the Spirit. That which is lame
   is soon turned out of the way, unless it be healed,' Heb. xii. 13. And
   nothing is so unstable and mutable as an unmortified soul; therefore we
   can never behave ourselves as a sacrifice and an offering to God,
   unless we mortify our members which are upon earth, inordinate
   affections, covetousness, and the like,' Col. iii. 5. In short, the
   flesh is that which is apt to be corrupted, and therefore the grace
   that doth preserve us must be something that doth wean us from the
   interests of the flesh, and what is that but the mortifying grace of
   the Holy Spirit? The apostle saith, Eph. vi. 24, Grace be with all them
   that love the Lord Jesus in sincerity,' or in incorruption.' There are
   many crooked lusts which are apt to corrupt us and withdraw our love to
   other things, but when these are mortified and subdued, that we may
   have a greater amplitude of affection towards God and Christ, then we
   are said to love him in sincerity and in incorruption.

   2. Salt hath an acrimony, and doth macerate things and pierce into
   them; and so the grace of mortification is painful and troublesome to
   the carnal nature. How healthful and useful soever it be to the soul,
   no question it is distasteful to curb our affections, and govern our
   hearts in the fear of God, and to row against the stream of flesh and
   blood; but yet it is wholesome, it is a crucifying of the flesh, to
   handle it as Christ suffered on the cross, to give it vinegar and gall;
   but yet this is necessary; this is the thing which our Lord intends
   here in the context, that the sacrifice must be consumed or macerated;
   we either must suffer the pains of hell or the pains of mortification;
   we must be salted with fire or salted with salt. It is better to pass
   to heaven with difficulty and austerity, than to avoid these
   difficulties and run into sin, and so be in danger of eternal fire. The
   strictness of Christianity is nothing so grievous as the punishment of
   sin. The philosophers, when they speak of the nature of man, observe
   that in the concupiscible part, to` ugro`n, something like moisture
   inclines to pleasure, in the irascible, to` psu'chron, something like
   cold inclines to fear. This salt is to fetch out both, by checking our
   sensual inclination and also our worldly fears. We must crucify the
   flesh with the passions and lusts thereof; they that are Christ's have
   done so, Gal. v. 24. We should rather displease ourselves and displease
   all the world than displease God, or be unfaithful in our duty to
   Christ. No profit, no pleasure, or secular concernment is so necessary,
   so comfortable, so useful to us as salvation.

   3. Salt makes things savoury, so grace makes us savoury; which may be
   interpreted with respect either to God or man.

   [1.] Acceptable to God when seasoned with this salt, for God would
   accept of no sacrifice without it. Not that he tasted of their meat
   offerings, or did eat the fat or flesh of bulls and goats, and drink
   their blood, and so would have it seasoned for his palate and appetite;
   it is not so to be understood; but in types as well as in similitudes
   there is a condescension to our sense and apprehension of things. That
   that is salted is savoury, therefore God would note his acceptation of
   our persons and services this way. By nature we are all odious,
   unsavoury, and distasteful to God by reason of sin: Ps. xiv. 3, They
   are all become filthy, there is none that doeth good, no not one: in
   the Hebrew, it is putrified, stinking like corrupt and rotten flesh. We
   must be salted and seasoned by the grace of Christ, and so we become
   amiable and acceptable in the sight of God. The more upright we are,
   the more he delighteth in us.

   [2.] To men: the more we are thus salted and mortified, the more shall
   we do good to others. Our Lord tells his disciples, Mat. v. 13, Ye are
   the salt of the earth: but if the salt lose its savour, wherewith shall
   it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and
   trodden under foot of men.' This is spoken to the disciples as
   disciples, not as apostles and public persons. It is a mistake to think
   that only ministers are the light of the world and the salt of the
   world. No; all Christians must shine as lights in the midst of a
   crooked and perverse generation; all Christians must be as the salt of
   the earth. Christ's whole sermon contains general duties, and the
   disciples were not yet sent abroad as apostles, nor ever heard of such
   a commission, or that their master would send them abroad for the
   proselyting the world to the kingdom of God: that was done afterwards,
   chap, x., and therefore here he speaks to Christians as Christians.
   Now, they are said to be salt, even as they season all those among whom
   they live. A Christian is never savoury in his conversation with others
   till he hath salt in himself; then all his actions are seasoned with
   grace, and beget a remembrance of God; then his words are seasoned with
   grace, and do good to others. The apostle saith, Eph. iv. 29, Let no
   corrupt communication come out of your mouth;' that rotten and corrupt
   communication which vents itself in slandering, railing, ribaldry,
   foolish jesting at holy things, lies, cursing, and the like: all these
   come from a corrupt heart, as a stinking breath argues rotten lungs.
   These want the grace of mortification: so are all sap less spirits,
   that cannot speak anything of God seriously, but in their most serious
   discourse are as fresh as water. But go among the mortified, and you
   receive the savour of good things from them; you have not only savoury
   prayers and savoury sermons, but savoury conferences and discourses:
   Col. iv. 6, Let your speech be alway powdered with salt;' that is, do
   not speak idly, much less profanely, but in an edifying manner. Now,
   Christians ought to take heed they do not lose their savouriness, for
   then they do not please God nor profit man, and are fit for nothing but
   the dunghill. Thus I have proved the second thing, that the grace of
   mortification is the true salt that sea sons Christians.

   III. There is a necessity of this salt in all those that have entered
   into covenant with God, and have dedicated and devoted themselves to
   him.

   1. By our covenant vow we are bound to the strictest duties, and that
   upon the highest penalties. The duty to which we are bound is very
   strict. We have answered God in all the demands of his covenant: 1
   Peter iii. 21, For baptism saveth as the answer of a good conscience
   towards God.' The Lord demands and puts in effect this question, Will
   you die unto sin and live unto righteousness? This is the tenor of the
   baptismal covenant that is so often, so solemnly, renewed at the Lord's
   Supper; and you are to reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin and alive
   unto righteousness, through Christ Jesus our Lord,' Rom. vi. 11; reckon
   yourselves, that is, in vow and obligation. Arid the penalty is very
   high if we sin wilfully, Heb. x. 26; so that our admission into
   Christ's family will be in vain, yea, to our further ruin if you do not
   stand to the covenant, if you keep sin still alive, and add fuel to the
   flames.

   2. The abundance of sin that yet remains in us, and the marvellous
   activity of it in our souls. We cannot get rid of this cursed inmate
   till our tabernacle be dissolved, and this house of clay tumbled into
   the dust. Paul groaned sorely under it: wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death?' Rom. vii. 24. And it is
   called sin that doth easily beset us,' Heb. xii. 1. Well, then, since
   sin is not nullified, it must be mortified. It works, it wars, there is
   a marvellous activity in it, it is very active and restless: Rom. vii.
   8, Sin wrought in me all manner of concupiscence;' he means sinful
   nature. And the apostle James tells us, chap. iv. 5, The spirit that
   dwelleth in us lusteth to envy.' There is not a sleepy, but a stirling
   principle always inclining us to evil, and hindering that which is
   good. Sin doth not only make us a little flexible and yielding, to
   temptations, but doth hurry us and impel us thereunto. It is a law
   warring in our members, that brings us into captivity to sin,' Rom.
   vii. 23. Corrupt nature is not a tame thing, that works not till it be
   irritated by the suggestions of Satan or temptations of the world, but
   is like a living spring, that pours out water of its own accord; it
   will not let us alone. The heart of man is evil continually, and so it
   always hinders us from that that is good: Rom. vii. 21, When I would do
   good, evil is present with me.' It blunts the edge of our affections,
   it seeks to weaken our purposes by unbelieving thoughts, or drawing us
   away from God by the lure of some sensitive delight; in stealing our
   hearts from him in the very duties and solemn addresses we make to him;
   distracting our minds with thoughts of the world, and the pomp and
   glory thereof; and so turns our very duties into sin, and makes us lose
   the comfort and sweetness of them: it blasts and perverts our most
   sincere endeavours. Well, then, without this salt of the covenant, if
   this be so, what shall we do? Have we not need to keep humble and
   watchful? If sin be stirring, we must be stirring against it, and
   improve the grace of the Holy Spirit upon the account of Christ's
   death, and use all good means that it may be subdued in us.

   3. Consider the sad consequences of letting sin alone, both either as
   to further sin or punishment.

   [1.] As to further sin. For Christ speaks here of scandals. If lust be
   not mortified, it grows outrageous; it has foiled us before God, men,
   and angels, and exposed us to an open shame, or hardens us in a dead,
   careless course. Lusts let alone end in gross sins, and gross sins in
   final apostasy. Love of pleasure will end in drunkenness, or adultery,
   or the rage of unclean desires, or else in such a vain, light, frothy
   spirit, which is no way fit for religion. Envy will end in mischief and
   violence, if not in murder. Judas, by his covetousness, was brought to
   betray his master. Gehazi was first surprised with covetousness, then
   blasted with leprosy, and then became a shame and burthen to himself.
   The devil trieth by lust to bring us to sin, and by sin to shame, and
   by shame to horror and despair. But do the children of God run into
   such notable excesses and disorders? Yes; when they let sin alone,
   discontinue the exercise of mortification; when they do not remember
   the sacrifice must be salted with salt. Witness David, who ran into
   lust and blood. Witness Peter, who ran into denying Christ with oaths
   and execrations. Witness Solomon, who ran into sensuality and idolatry.
   And in all of us, old sins, long since laid asleep, may awake again and
   hurry us into spiritual mischiefs and in conveniences, if we make not
   use of this holy salt.

   [2.] As to punishment. Sins prove mortal if they be not modified.
   Either sin must die or the sinner. There is an evil in sin, and there
   is an evil after sin. The evil in sin is the violation of God's
   righteous law; the evil after sin is the just punishment of it, eternal
   death and damnation. Now, those that are not sensible, or will not be
   sensible, of the evil that is in sin, they shall be made sensible of
   the evil that comes after sin. The unmortified person spares the sin
   and destroys his own soul; the sin lives, but he dies. In the prophet's
   parable to the king of Israel, when he had let go the Syrian, saith he,
   Thy life shall go for his life;' so our lives shall go for the life of
   our sin. The end of these things is death,' Rom. vi. 21; and The wages
   of sin is death,' ver. 23.

   But you will say, What is this to a justified person?' There is no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ.'

   I answer--You must take in all. Those who are in Christ, that walk not
   after the flesh, but after the spirit,' they have the salt of the
   covenant. But if you can suppose a justified person to live after the
   flesh, you may suppose also a justified person shall be condemned.
   Eternal death may be considered two ways either as to the merit, or as
   to the event. As to the merit, as an evil which God hath appointed to
   be the fruit of sin; or as to the event, an evil that will certainly
   befall us. A justified person, one that is really so, may, must fear it
   in the first sense. There is such a connection between living in sin
   and eternal punishment, that he ought to represent the danger to his
   soul of living willingly and allowedly in his sins, that he may eschew
   it; for this is nothing but a holy making use of the threatenings, or
   considering the merit of sin. But as to the actual event, and
   perplexing trouble that ariseth from the apprehension of it; if his
   sincerity be clear and unquestionable, he must not fear it.

   Now to make application.

   I. For the reproof of those that cannot abide to hear of mortification.
   The unwillingness and impatience of this doctrine may arise from
   several causes.

   1. From sottish atheism and unbelief. They despise all sober spiritual
   counsel, they make no conscience of yielding obedience to God. Solomon
   tells us, Prov. xix. 16, He that keepeth the commandments keepeth his
   own soul; but he that despiseth his way shall die.' There are the
   different issues of a strict obedience, and a slight vain conversation.
   And mark the opposition of the two tempers--he that keeps the
   commandments, and he that despiseth his own ways; that is, takes no
   heed to his life and actions, to order them according to the will of
   God; he cares not whether he please or displease, whether he honour or
   dishonour God, but leaves the boat to the stream, lives as his brutish
   lusts incline him, come of it what will come. He despiseth his own
   ways, and so runs into vanity, luxury, riot, fraud, injustice, and all
   manner of licentiousness. Now, no man thus despiseth his own ways but
   he despiseth other things which should be very sacred and of great
   regard and esteem with him. He despiseth God, and the word of God, and
   his own soul: Prov. xiv. 2, He that walketh in his uprightness, fears
   God; but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.' He that makes
   conscience of his duty hath a high esteem of God, he looks on his
   authority as supreme, his powers as infinite, his knowledge of all
   things exact, his truth in promises and threatenings as unquestionable,
   his holiness as immaculate, his justice as impartial, and his goodness
   exercised to us in sundry benefits as rich and every way glorious.
   Therefore he dare not but please God; he hath such a deep reverence for
   him, that he is always saying within himself, What will the holy and
   all-seeing God have done? Or, How can I do this wickedness and sin
   against God?' But now the careless and slight person that takes no care
   to govern his actions according to the will of God, hath contemptuous
   and slight thoughts of God, as if he were a senseless idol that took no
   notice of human affairs, that sees not, or would not punish the
   breaches of his laws. They also despise the word of God: Prov. xiii.
   13, He that despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he that fears
   the commandment shall be rewarded.' There are some gracious hearts that
   stand in awe of the word, and though their minds be never so much set
   upon a thing, yet if a commandment stand in the way, it is more than if
   an angel with a drawn sword stood in the way to keep them back; they
   dare not break through God's hedge. But now a carnal, careless, and
   unbelieving wretch sets at nought all the precepts, promises, and
   threatenings of God, and can break with him for a trifle, for a little
   vain delight and profit. Nay, further, he despiseth his own soul: Prov.
   xv. 32, He that refuseth instruction, despiseth his own soul.' He only
   cares for the body, but neglects his soul, scarce ever considers
   whether he has a soul to save or a soul to lose, as if he counted all
   fabulous which is spoken of God and immortality, of the day of
   judgment, or of heaven and hell. Now it is in vain to speak to these to
   renounce and mortify their pleasing lusts till their atheism and
   carelessness be cured. And their case is the more desperate because the
   disease doth not lie in their minds, but in their hearts, and comes not
   so much from opinion as inclination. A settled opinion must be
   vanquished by reason, but a brutish inclination must be weakened by
   almighty grace.

   2. It may come from libertinism. And these harden their hearts in
   sinning by a mistaking the gospel.

   [1.] Some vainly imagine as if God by Jesus Christ were made more
   reconcilable to sin, that it needs not so much to be stood upon, nor
   need we to be so exact, to keep such ado to mortify and subdue the
   inclinations that lead to it. They altogether run to the comforts of
   the gospel and neglect the duties thereof. Christ died for sinners,
   therefore we need not to be troubled about it. Some actually speak out
   these things as if all the mortification required were but to quell the
   sense of sin in the conscience, not to destroy the power of sin in
   their hearts, and if they can but believe strongly they are pardoned,
   all is well. If this were true, then in the hardest heart would be the
   best faith, for they have the least trouble about sin, and least
   conscience of sin. This is to cry up the merit of Christ, to exclude
   the work and discipline of this spirit, [18] yea to set the merit of
   his death against the end of it, and so to set Christ against Christ.
   He bore our sins: He bore our sins in his body upon the tree, that we
   might be dead to sin, and alive to righteousness,' to promote this
   mortification that we speak of.

   [2.] Another sort think such discourses may be well spared among a
   company of believers, and they need not this watchfulness and holy
   care, especially against grievous sins; that they have such good
   command of themselves that they can keep within compass well enough. It
   is well if you be come to this height of Christian perfection, that
   temptations make none, or no considerable impression upon you. But we
   must warn you, and that of the most gross sins. Christ thought fit to
   warn his disciples: Luke xxi. 34, Take heed lest your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this
   life.' And the apostle everywhere warns Christians of malice, of
   hypocrisy, of envy, of lying, of evil speaking: 1 Thes. iv. 6, Take
   heed that you do not overreach and defraud one another, for God is the
   avenger of all such.' But these men would be fed with refined strains
   of contemplative divinity, and have no sins reproved, but such kind of
   sins as would seem a credit rather than a disgrace; like those diseases
   that are incident only to the best complexions and constitutions. If
   you speak against something that may rather argue their excellency than
   shame them of their sin, you shall be welcome. This over-spiritual
   preaching ends in an airy religion. Is sin grown less dangerous, or men
   more skilful to avoid it than heretofore? Certainly, he that considers
   how many scandalous professors there are, that would be accounted the
   people of God, hath no cause to think so. If Paul saw need of
   mortification, 1 Cor. ix. 27, we are not more strong, but more
   foolhardy.

   [3.] A third sort are such as think believers are not to be scared with
   threatenings, but only oiled with grace. But then consider, the words
   of Christ were to his disciples. And to whom did the apostle Paul
   write? To believers questionless: If you live after the flesh, ye shall
   die; but if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body,
   ye shall live,' Rom. viii. 13. No part of the Spirit's discipline must
   be omitted. If one end of Christ's coming was to verify God's
   threatenings, and that the curse of the law should not fall to the
   ground, surely there is use of threatenings still.

   3. It may arise from another cause, that is, the passionateness of
   carnal affections. Men are so wedded to their lusts, they cannot leave
   them, and so strangely besotted, they are even ready to sit down and
   say they will venture their souls rather than live a strict life. Is
   the pleasing of the flesh so sweet to you? or hell so slight a matter?
   And will the day of judgment be so slubbered over? There is a raging
   despair, and there is a sottish despair. The raging despair of a Cain,
   Gen. iv. 13, My evil is greater than can be borne!'--when we are ready
   to sink under the burden of our sins; and a sottish despair, when we
   are not sound with God, and loth to improve the grace of the Redeemer,
   but say, There is no hope; we will go on in the imaginations of our own
   heart, Jer. ii. 25. There is no hope; it is an evil, and I must bear
   it. If I be damned, I cannot help it, I must bear it as well as I can.
   What! will you bear the loss of heaven, the wrath of the almighty and
   eternal God? Surely you know not what eternity means, what hell and
   heaven means. You will know, when the eyes that are now blinded by the
   delusions of the flesh shall be opened, when you shall see others sit
   down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God, and you
   shall be shut out,' Canst thou bear this? If Rachel could not endure
   the want of children, and Jacob the supposed loss of Joseph, when all
   his sons and daughters rose up to comfort him; if Ahitophel could not
   endure the loss of his credit in counsel, how wilt thou endure the loss
   of thy soul and the glory of the blessed to all eternity? When thou
   hast nothing to be guile thy mind, and thou art divested of all other
   comforts, and thou must feed upon this for ever. So for the pains of
   hell. Thou that canst not endure to be scorched a day or two in
   feverish flames, or the pain of the stone or gout, when God arms the
   humours of thine own body against thee, and canst not endure the
   torment of an aching tooth, how canst thou endure the wrath of an
   eternal God? Can your hearts endure, or your hands be made strong in
   the day that I will deal with you? saith the Lord.'

   Use 2. Is to persuade you not to neglect the salt of the covenant. It
   may be fretting, but it is healthful; as the most salutary medicines
   are usually most troublesome. To help you to improve this kind of
   argument, which our Lord here useth--

   1. Consider, there are but two sorts of men in the world, and you are
   one of them. There is no neutral, no middle state; there are but two
   principles that men are influenced by, the flesh and the spirit; and
   there are but two ends men propound to themselves, either the pleasing
   of the flesh upon earth, or the enjoyment of God in heaven; and two
   places they issue into, heaven or hell. The scripture is peremptory,
   and tells you who shall go to heaven, and who shall go to hell: Rom.
   viii. 13, If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through
   the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live;' Gal. vi.
   8, He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but
   he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
   everlasting.' Or consider that, Prov. xiv. 14, The backslider in heart
   shall be filled with his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied
   from himself.' There are two different persons commencing and setting
   forth in the pursuit of happiness, the backslider in heart and the good
   man. The backslider in heart is one that continues m the apostasy and
   defection of mankind, that indulgeth his lusts and vain pleasures, and
   for a seeming good leaves God, who is the chief good. But the good men
   are those who make it their business to keep their hearts chaste and
   loyal to God. They both desire to be filled and to be satisfied. The
   one takes his own way, and the other God's counsel; and in the event
   both are filled. The backslider in heart hath enough of his own ways
   when they have brought him to hell; and the good man hath enough when
   he comes to the enjoyment of the blessed God. And there is one truth
   more there, they are both filled from themselves, their own ways. The
   backslider shall have the fruit of his own choice, and a good man is
   satisfied with that course of godliness that he hath chosen, Prov. i.
   31. Those that turn away from God, it is said, They shall eat of their
   own ways, and be filled with the fruit of their own devices;' and Isa.
   iii. 10, Say unto the righteous, it shall be well with him, for he
   shall eat of the fruit of his own doings.'

   2. Consider the doleful condition of those that indulge their carnal
   affections; and that either threatened by God, or executed upon the
   wicked.

   [1.] Consider it as it is threatened by God. If God threaten so great a
   misery, it is for our profit, that we may take heed and escape it.
   There is mercy in the severest threatenings, that we may avoid the bait
   when we see the hook, that we may digest the strictness of a holy life,
   rather than venture upon such dreadful evils. Why did our Lord repeat
   it three times, Where the worm never dies, and the fire is never
   quenched'? but that we may have it often in our thoughts, that we may
   not buy the pleasures of sin at so dear a rate--so hard a price as the
   loss of our precious souls.

   [2.] Consider the punishment as executed upon the wicked. How many are
   now burning in hell for those sins which you are ready to commit? The
   serious consideration of it will check the fervour of your lusts, that
   you may not easily venture upon an everlasting hell.

   [3.] Consider which trouble is most intolerable--to be salted with
   salt, or to be salted with fire; with unpleasing mortification, or the
   pains of hell; the trouble of physic, or the danger of a mortal
   disease. Surely to preserve the life of the body, men will endure the
   bitterest pill, take the most loathsome potion. Why? their lives lie on
   it. And shall we be unwilling to such a necessary strictness, to these
   wholesome severities, which conduce to save you with an everlasting
   salvation? There is no remedy; trouble must be undergone. Surely a
   strict diet is better than a speedy death; and the pricking of a vein
   by a chirurgeon is not so bad as a stab at the heart by an enemy.
   Better be macerated by repentance, than broken in hell by torments.
   Which is worse, discipline or execution? Here the question is put: you
   must be troubled first or last. Would you have a sorrow mixed with love
   and hope, or else mixed with desperation? Would you have a drop or an
   ocean? Would you have your souls cured or tormented? Would you have
   trouble in the short moment of this life, or have it eternal in the
   world to come?

   [4.] Be sure you be a sacrifice dedicated to God, really entered into
   covenant with God, and set apart for his use; that this may be your
   end, your business, your scope, to please, glorify, and enjoy him, 2
   Cor. i. 9. We can the better speak to you when you are under a covenant
   engagement. Christ bound you to this when he died for you: he
   sanctified himself that you might be sanctified through the truth,'
   that is, dedicated to God, John xvii. 19; and by one offering he hath
   perfected for ever them that are sanctified,' that is, them that are
   consecrated to God, or entered into a holy covenant with God. Christ
   bound you to it, and your own gratitude will suggest it to you: I
   beseech you, by the mercies of the Lord, present yourselves,' &c. Nay,
   the new nature will incline you to it: Rom. vi. 13, Yield yourselves
   unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
   instruments of righteousness unto God.' The new life will presently
   discover itself by its tendency and end, if this be indeed your end and
   work to be faithful to God's covenant.

   [5.] You will see a need of denying worldly and fleshly lusts; you will
   see nothing can be done in the spiritual life without mortification,
   that being dead to all things here below, you may be alive to God. That
   this must be your daily work, your necessity will sufficiently show.
   Are there no rebellious desires to be subdued? No corrupt inclinations
   to be broken? Do not you feel the bias of corruption drawing you off
   from God? David did, therefore he saith, Incline my heart to thy
   testimonies, and not to covetousness.' Do not you find the sensitive
   lure prevail upon you, enticing your minds, and drawing you from the
   purity of your hopes, and strictness of conversation? Every man is
   drawn away, when he is enticed by his own lusts,' James i. 14.

   [6.] Consider the sad condition of a believer that is under the
   corrective discipline of God, though he do not vacate his justified
   state. A sinning believer, that hath made bold with forbidden fruit,
   how doth he smart for sin? What a wound in the conscience will wilful
   heinous sins make? Witness David, Ps. xxxii. and li. He gives an
   account how uneasy his heart did sit within him, he was afraid of God,
   who before was his joy and delight, and speaks as one ready to be cast
   out of his presence.

SERMON VI.

   And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
   patient waiting for Christ.--2 Thes. III. 5.

   THERE are two things keep religion alive in the soul--a love to God,
   and a hearty intent upon the coming of Christ. These are the two
   necessary graces which the apostle prays for in the text. Here is the
   love of God, that is the first grace, and the earnest or patient
   waiting for Christ. Love respects God, because he is the chief object
   of it, primum amabile, as being the first and chiefest good; but hope
   or patient expectation respects Christ, who, at his glorious coming,
   will give us our full reward. Love is the life and soul of our present
   duties, and by patient expectation we wait for our future hope. The
   love of God urgeth us to the duties of religion, and hope strengthens
   us against temptations, whether they arise from the allurements of
   sense or the troubles of the world. Love is our breastplate that guards
   the vitals of Christianity, and hope is our helmet that covers our
   head, that we may hold up our head in the midst of all the troubles and
   sorrows of the present life, 1 Thes. v. 8. Both graces are necessary,
   therefore it will not be unprofitable to insist upon them. I begin now
   with the former, The Lord direct your hearts to the love of God,' where
   note--

   1. The grace prayed for: the love of God.

   2. The efficiency which is necessary to produce it: the Lord direct
   your hearts. The word direct notes sometimes conduct and guidance, and
   sometimes bending or setting straight the thing that is crooked.
   Conduct and guidance, as we guide men that they may not go wrong: Ps.
   cxix. 5, Oh, that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes.' Ships
   that are best rigged need a pilot, and they that love God most need to
   have their love ordered and directed to the best advantage of his glory
   and service. This for the first signification, guidance, and direction.
   But at other times it signifies the bending, inclining, or making
   straight what is crooked, and what bends and tends another way; in this
   sense I take it here. Our hearts are distorted and writhed, and averse
   from God and all good naturally; yea, and after grace received, are apt
   to wander, and return to their old bent and bias again; therefore, the
   apostle prays that God would form and set their hearts straight, that
   they may be more indeclinably fixed towards God; and this prayer he
   makes for the Thessalonians, whose work of faith and labour of love and
   patience of hope' he had so much commended before, and of whose
   sincerity he had such great confidence; for those he prays that their
   love might be directed, and their hearts more fixedly set towards God.
   The note then will be plain and easy.

   Doct. That we cannot have or keep up any true love to God, unless the
   Lord set our hearts straight, and keep them bent towards himself. I
   shall inquire here:--

   1. What is love to God? Love is the complacency of the soul in what is
   good. Love to God is the complacency and well-pleasedness of the soul
   in God as our all-sufficient portion. To open it to you, I shall
   describe it:--

   I. By its radical and internal acts.

   II. By its external effects.

   III. A little touch upon the properties of it, and then you will see
   what the love of God is.

   I. The radical and internal acts are two--desire and delight; desire
   after him and delight in him.

   1. Desire after him. Love affects union with the thing beloved; and so
   love to God implies an earnest seeking after him, in the highest way of
   enjoyment that we are capable of in this world. This appears partly by
   the kind of mercies that we affect, and partly by the fervency of our
   endeavours after him.

   [1.] By the kind of mercies that we affect. There are some mercies
   vouchsafed to the creature that lie nearer to God than others do, and
   do least detain us from him, as his image and favour, or his renewing
   and reconciling grace. When we love God, these are sought in the first
   place, as you shall see how the temper of the saints is described and
   distinguished from the temper of the brutish multitude: Ps. iv. 6, 7,
   The many say, Who will show us any good? but, Lord, lift thou up the
   light of thy countenance upon us, and this will put gladness into our
   hearts.' The many, the brutish multitude, seek an uncertain good, and
   they seek it from an uncertain author--Who will show us?'--they do not
   acknowledge God in these common mercies; but the children of God must
   have his favour--Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
   us;' as the beams of the sun do cheer and refresh the earth, this is
   that that doth revive their souls. So Mat. v. 6, Blessed are they that
   hunger and thirst after righteousness.' Well, then, they that desire to
   be like God in purity and holiness, and to recover his favour lost by
   sin, do certainly more love him than those that only seek temporal
   mercies from him. God's sanctifying Spirit witnessing his love to us is
   the greatest gift can be bestowed in this life, and will more witness
   his love than anything else can be given us. This the saints seek
   after, that they may be like God, that they may be accepted and well
   pleasing unto God--this is all their ambition: 2 Cor. v. 9, Wherefore
   we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of the
   Lord.' Other things may please the flesh, but that is not their design;
   those things that bring them nearer to God take up their mind and
   heart. Now as it appears by the mercies we affect, so it appears--

   [2.] By the fervency of our endeavours after these things; for if the
   image of God and favour of God be sought superficially, or as things
   that we may be well without, and the wealth, honours, and pleasures of
   the world be most earnestly sought after, surely we do not love God:
   Ps. lxiii. 8, My soul followeth hard after thee.' The whole spiritual
   life is but a pursuit of the soul towards God; and the more constantly
   and earnestly we seek him, to enjoy more of his saving graces and
   benefits, the more we have of the love of God in us. Therefore David
   expresseth this desire, as exceeding all other desires: Ps. xxvii. 4,
   One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I
   might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold
   the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.' He sought not
   the glory of the kingdom, success in battle, victory over his enemies,
   in the first place, or not so much as converse with God, and attendance
   on his worship in the tabernacle; all was nothing to this, that he
   might have communion with God. Therefore this is the radical act of
   love--this fervent, burning desire that carries the soul through all
   duties, ordinances, services; they are still making their way to a
   nearer access to God, and larger participation of his grace, till they
   come eternally to enjoy him in glory.

   2. There is another internal radical act of love; that is, a delight in
   him. Our full joy is reserved for the other world, but delighting
   ourselves in God is a greater duty now; for love being the complacence
   of the soul in God, as apprehended to be good, or a delightful adhesion
   to God as our all-sufficient portion and happiness, it cannot be
   imagined love can be without any delight in God even now. Now in this
   valley of tears, the hope of enjoying him hereafter is our comfort and
   solace in the midst of our weaknesses and afflictions, that there is a
   time coming when we shall more perfectly see him as he is,' and be like
   him,' 1 John iii. 2. The apostle tells us, We rejoice now in the hope
   of the glory of God;' that we have this in expectation, that we shall
   have an estate of complete felicity and excellent holiness; that we
   shall behold bur nature united to the godhead in the glorified
   redeemer, and our persons admitted into the nearest intuition and
   fruition of God we are capable of, and live in the exercise of a
   constant uninterrupted love, and be perfectly capable of receiving his
   highest benefits. Surely this joy we have in our pilgrimage. But there
   is not only our hope, but our partial enjoyment of it is matter of
   happiness to us; his favour is as life, and his frown as death to the
   soul that loves him. The saints look on God reconciled as the best
   friend, God displeased as the most dreadful adversary; therefore if
   they have any taste of his love, their souls are filled as with marrow
   and fatness:' Ps. lxiii. 3-5, Because thy loving-kindness is better
   than life, my lips shall praise thee. I will bless thee while I live.
   My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth
   shall praise thee with joyful lips.' But if God hide his face; if God
   be altogether a stranger, then they are troubled indeed, Ps. xxx. 7.
   But yet we are not gone to the bottom of the matter of delighting in
   God. Those whose souls are possessed with the love of God, are so well
   pleased with him, that everything is sweet to them by the relation it
   hath to God. It is a delight to them to think of God: Ps. civ. 34, I
   will be glad and rejoice in him; my meditation of him shall be sweet.'
   It is a delight to them to speak of God: Eph. v. 4, Not foolish
   jesting, but giving of thanks.' The delight of God's children, or that
   which serves instead of jesting to Christians, is the grateful
   remembrance of the Lord's mercies, especially of our redemption by
   Christ. To draw nigh to him in ordinances, there this delight is
   exercised again. There is prayer. A gracious soul cannot be a stranger
   to it, because it cannot have a greater refreshing than to be alone
   with God, and unbosom himself with God. The hypocrite is rejected from
   being capable of this character: Job xxvii. 10, Will he delight himself
   in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?' Sometimes he will call
   upon God, he is frighted into a little religiousness, it may be, when
   death is at his back, in great afflictions, or time of great judgments;
   but he hath no constant delight in God. The constant delight in God is
   that that brings the saints into his presence. So for all other
   Christian duties: Ps. cxxii. 1, I was glad when they said unto me,
   Come, let us go into the house of the Lord.' There they entertained
   traffic and commerce with God about matters of the highest concernment
   to their precious and immortal souls. Nay, all their work, the whole
   course of their obedience, is sweetened to them, because it is
   commanded by God, and tends to the enjoyment of God: as Ps. cxii. 1,
   Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in
   his commandments;' they not only keep the commandments, but delight
   (and that greatly) to keep the commandments. And Ps. cxix. 14, I have
   rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.'
   Delight in God is a great act of love, to which we should not be
   strangers, even in the house of our pilgrimage, though we have no
   assurance or sensible enjoyment of his favour; for it is a duty of the
   first commandment, that results from the owning of God as our God.

   II. For the external effects of love, they are doing and suffering his
   will, when we are contented to do what God will have us do, and be what
   God will have us be.

   1. For doing. If we love God, we shall be loth to offend him, we shall
   be desirous to please him. Faith, I do confess, is a marvellous grace,
   it can apprehend things strange to nature, but it can do no worthy
   thing for God, till it be accompanied with love, Gal. v. 6. When the
   apostle tells us of that faith, that carries away the prize of
   justification, he describes it to be a faith working by love.' Faith
   itself serves as the bellows to blow up this flame in our hearts, as
   the next and immediate principle of action. In short, love is the over
   ruling bent of our souls, the weight and poize upon us that inclines us
   to God. And look, as all noble qualities, when restrained, cannot
   produce their consummate act, so love suffers a kind of imperfection,
   till it can thus break forth into some act of thankfulness to God; but
   then it is perfected: 1 John ii. 5, Whoso keepeth his word, in him the
   love of God is perfect,' that is, hath attained its consummate act,
   that which it aims at. No man certainly can be owned as a perfect,
   sincere lover of God, but he that makes conscience of doing what he
   commands; none but they have a deep sense of his majesty; none but they
   have an esteem of his favour; therefore they dare not hazard it by a
   breach or neglect of their duty.

   2. For suffering his will. For when the apostle prays here God would
   direct their hearts to love him, he means that they should endure
   anything rather than deny the faith, and confess Christ whatever it
   cost them. As obedience is virtually contained in love, so also courage
   and resolution. Solomon represents love as a powerful thing, as an
   affection that will not be bribed nor quenched: Cant. viii. 7, Many
   waters cannot quench love, nor can the floods drown it: if a man would
   give the whole substance of his house for it, it would be utterly
   contemned.' It is true of love in general, much more of love to God. In
   carnal matters, love is a venomous poison; when it hath invaded the
   heart, nothing will reclaim us: but in divine matters, it is a
   sovereign antidote against temptations, both on the right hand and on
   the left. For right-hand temptations, all the riches, pleasures,
   honours, are contemned, they cannot bribe them over from Christ that
   really love him. All the floods of persecution cannot quench this holy
   desire. This is the genius and disposition of love, when once the bent
   of the heart is set towards God and heaven, they are vehemently set
   against anything that would turn them out of the way, and divert them
   from their purpose.

   III. To speak of the properties; if it be sincere:--

   1. It is not a speculative but practical love, not consisting in lofty
   airy strains of devotion too high for the common rate of us poor
   mortals. No; it is put upon a surer and infallible test our obedience
   to God. Again, it consists not in a bold familiarity, but in a humble
   subjection and compliance with his will. He that hath my commandments
   and keeps them, he it is that loves me,' God's love is a love of
   bounty, but ours a love of duty; therefore we are properly said to love
   God when we are careful to please him, and fearful to offend him. The
   scripture declares both: the first, This is love, to keep his
   commandments, and his commandments are not grievous;' the second, Ps.
   xcvii. 10, Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.' When we are fearful of
   committing or omitting anything may be a violation of his law, a grief
   to his Spirit, or a dishonour to his name, then we are said to love
   God. Whatever lofty and luscious strains of devotion we may otherwise
   please ourselves with, here will our trial rest. He doth not love God
   that can most accurately discourse of his attributes, or soar aloft in
   the nice speculations of contemplative divinity, or pretences of
   secrecy with God, but he that is most awful, serious and conscientious
   in his duty.

   2. It is a transcendental love we owe to God; we must love him above
   all other things. For he must be loved as our felicity and end. He must
   have the chiefest place in our hearts, and our principal design must be
   to please, serve, and glorify him. If we seek God in order to other
   things, we do not love him, but our own lusts; nay, if all other things
   be not sought after in order to God, we do not set him up as our chief
   good or last end. He that loves father and mother more than me, is not
   worthy of me,' Luke xiv. 26; If any man come to me and hate not his
   father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,
   yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple,' Many have a
   partial, half love to God, but a greater love to other things; then
   God's interest will be least minded, for there is some thing nearer and
   dearer to us than God, which will be soon preferred before the
   conscience of our duty to him. No; all must be subordinated to our
   supreme happiness and last end, or else God is not loved as God.

   But now the second thing propounded is the nature of that influence
   upon love, which is expressed here by the apostle in the word direct'
   The Lord direct your hearts in the love of God.' What doth this imply?

   [1.] It implies that God works upon us as rational creatures; he
   changeth the heart indeed, but he doth it by direction: he draws' us to
   himself, but it is with the cords of a man;' he teacheth while he
   draws: John vi. 44, 45, None can come unto me but those whom the Father
   draws;' and he proves it by this, because they shall be all taught of
   God,' God's drawing is teaching, it is both by the attractive force of
   the object, and the internal efficacy of his grace; the Spirit's
   conduct is sweet, yet powerful, accomplisheth the effect, but without
   offering violence to the liberty of man. We are not forced, but
   directed. There is not a violent compulsion, but an inclination sweetly
   raised in us by victorious grace, or the overpowering sweetness of his
   love. For we love him, because he loved us first,' 1 John iv. 19. And
   this love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who by giving
   us an esteem and serious remembrance of his benefits, blows up this
   holy flame in our hearts. We do not love God we know not why or where
   fore; an account can be given of all the Spirit's operations. Look, as
   in an impression there must be a seal, and wax to the seal, and the
   hand that stamps it; so all concur here. The word doth its part, that
   is the seal, and the heart of man receives the impression; but to make
   it effectual and durable, the hand of God concurs, or the power of his
   Spirit. The object is the gospel, wherein God commends his love to us
   by the incarnation, death, and intercession of the Lord Jesus Christ;
   as also by the new covenant, because he will work upon man after the
   nature of man; by love he will work upon love. Beside all this, there
   is an internal powerful agent, the Holy Spirit. The external objective
   means cannot do it without the inward cause. Though God's love doth so
   gloriously and resplendently shine forth in the gospel, yet the heart
   of man is not affected with it till it be shed abroad by the
   illuminating sanctifying Spirit. The heart of man is dark and dead to
   these things till changed by grace, and when that is once done, that
   impression is according to the stamp.

   [2.] The inclination to God as our felicity and end, which is the fruit
   of this grace, is the inclination of a reasonable creature; so the
   inclination is necessary, but the acts are voluntary, therefore you
   must keep them up still. There is an inclination put by God into
   inanimate things, as in light and airy bodies to move upwards, and in
   heavy bodies to move downwards; as a stone falls to the earth, but fire
   and smoke ascend, they cannot do otherwise, because they have no
   choice. But now in man there is an inclination to God and heaven, which
   is the fruit of grace. The inclination is necessary. Why?--because all
   those whom the Spirit sanctifies, he sanctifies them not in vain, he
   certainly begets this tendency in them towards God: therefore so often
   they are said in scripture to be converted or turned to God. Their
   hearts were averse before, but then they tend and bend towards him; but
   the acts are voluntary. There is a duty lying upon us to stir up the
   gift of grace that is in us;' the word is anazopurein, 2 Tim. i. 6.
   When this holy fire is kindled in our bosoms, we must blow it up and
   keep it burning. We must not be negligent and secure, for we cannot
   reasonably imagine the idle and diligent should fare alike, that the
   Holy Ghost will direct our hearts into the love of God whether we will
   or not; therefore, not only as we are rational agents, but as we are
   new creatures, we are obliged to use the means, and then expect his
   help and blessing. What is a prayer in the text, The Lord direct your
   hearts into the love of God, to the patient waiting for Christ,' is an
   exhortation, Jude 21, Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for
   the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto everlasting life.' There is
   both again; you must look to your love, that your hearts be kept
   straight and bent towards God, and not distracted with worldly
   vanities. The blessing is from God, but you must use the means; this
   direction is not to encourage slothfulness, but industry. We must
   charge it upon ourselves, as our main work and duty: the Spirit stirs
   and quickens, we must rouse up ourselves.

   [3.] It implies there are many things would writhe, and crook, and turn
   our hearts another way--the devil, the world, and the flesh. The devil
   seeks to draw us off from God, to abate the fervour of our love towards
   him; therefore we are bidden to flee youthful lusts,' 2 Tim. ii. 22,
   that we may not be taken captive by him at his will and pleasure. Some
   tamely yield to his temptations, and he doth unto them as he listeth;
   but there is more tugging and drawing to get a serious Christian into
   his snare. Therefore, we are bidden to be sober and watchful, for your
   adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he
   may devour.' Sobriety is a sparing use of worldly delights, and
   vigilance is a serious diligence in the use of all those holy means
   whereby temptations may be vanquished. And as the devil, so the flesh:
   James i. 14, A man is tempted when he is drawn away by his lusts, being
   enticed;' that is, by seeking to please his fleshly mind and appetite.
   And then the world would pervert us, and offers many baits to that end
   and purpose: 1 John ii. 15, 16, Love not the world, nor the things of
   the world; for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
   in him. For whatsoever is in the world, is either the lust of the eyes,
   the lust of the flesh, or the pride of life;' that is, pleasures,
   riches, and honours. These seem sweet baits, but there is a dangerous
   hook in them, and your love to God may soon be lessened. Well, then,
   this directing is opposed to wavering by reason of any of these
   temptations on the one or the other side, that the Holiest may keep in
   us that ardent love of God which of duty we owe to him.

   [4.] Directing notes the orderliness of the new creature. There is not
   a more beautiful thing in the world when the motions thereof are
   directed by the Spirit, for then we are in a due posture both to God,
   our neighbour, and ourselves. To God, for then the creature is kept in
   a due subjection to him, and all our motions and actions are
   subordinated to his glory. When we sin we are in rebellion against God,
   and set up the creature against him, as if it were more amiable and
   fitter to content and delight the soul than God, and so disturb the
   order and harmony of the world, abusing both ourselves and all things
   within our grasp to a wrong end. Look, as in the motions of a watch,
   there is such a proportion in every part, that if one wheel be wrong
   the whole is put out of frame; so the world, that was made for us, and
   we for God, is all disordered when we use the world for ourselves and
   not for God. So as to our neighbour. Self-lovers and self-pleasers will
   never heartily do good to others. The most sincere commerce in the
   world is among those that love God. So for ourselves. Till the love of
   God rule in our hearts all is out of order. Look, as in the body, if
   the feet were there where the head should be, the disorder and
   deformity would be great; so it is in the soul, when the beast rides
   the man, and conscience and reason are made slaves to lust and
   appetite. But when once a man is gained to love God, everything is in
   frame again, self-government is restored, due obedience to God is well
   provided for.

   To give you some reasons to show you the necessity of this, both as to
   persons regenerate and unregenerate.

   1. The necessity of God's direction to persons unregenerate. They
   cannot love God till the Lord direct and set their hearts straight. It
   is a hard thing to say (but we must not mince the matter), that in the
   carnal state we were all haters of God, Rom. i. 28. And it were well if
   this enmity and hatred were thoroughly got out of our hearts. How can
   this be? Nature tells us that he from whom we have received being, and
   life, and all things, deserves our love. I answer--Though men may see
   some reason of love to God as he is our creator and preserver, but as
   he is a lawgiver and a judge, so we all hate him. Three reasons there
   are of that natural enmity that is in the hearts of men against God. I
   would have you consider them seriously, that we may feelingly bewail
   our own aversion from God.

   [1.] Our inclination to carnal things, which prepossesseth our hearts,
   and then there is no room for any inclination to God. Naturally men are
   addicted to vain and sensual delights, for that which is born of the
   flesh is flesh,' John iii. 6. Having no principle to incline them to
   God, they wholly seek to please the flesh. When men once lost original
   righteousness, they took up with what came next to hand, and so became
   lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,' 2 Tim. iii. 4. And this
   inclination we cannot divest ourselves of till it be cured by grace.
   Therefore the Lord promiseth this cure: Deut. xxx. 6, The Lord thy God
   will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the
   Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.' The heart
   must be circumcised before it can love God. Till God pare away the
   foreskin, and till this carnal love be mortified, there is no place for
   divine love to be raised and quickened in our hearts. We are entangled
   in the love of worldly things, and shall so remain till God bend the
   crooked stick the other way, and God set our hearts right to himself.

   [2.] The second reason is carnal liberty, and so we hate God as a law
   giver, who would bridle our lusts. There is in the law the precept and
   the sanction. The precept is to our purpose, the sanction will come to
   be considered in the next. Because of God's restraint we cannot enjoy
   our lusts with that freedom and security we desire. His law is in the
   way, therefore the heart riseth up against God, because he hath made a
   law to forbid those things that we affect: Rom. viii. 7, The natural
   mind is enmity to God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
   can be;' Col. i. 21, Enemies in your mind by evil works.' We love sin,
   therefore we hate God, who forbids it, and makes it so penal and
   damnable to us.

   [3.] Slavish fear is the cause of this enmity. This relates to the
   sanction and penalty of the law. Thus, we hate God, because we fear he
   will call us to account for our sins, and punish us; for a condemning
   God, barely apprehended under that notion, can never be loved by a
   guilty creature. Thus Adam, when he had sinned, ran away from God, and
   hid himself in the bushes, Gen. iii. 7, 10. Now it is in vain to come
   and tell them of the goodness of God and his perfections till he change
   their hearts; as you do in vain induce a guilty prisoner to love his
   judge, to tell him he is a discreet person, a man of solid judgment,
   one well skilled and versed in the law--this sticks, he is one that
   will condemn him. Therefore the gospel, as a means to induce us to love
   God, sets him forth as a sin-pardoning God: There is forgiveness with
   thee, that thou mayest be feared.'

   2. Come we to the regenerate. The Thessalonians did excel in all
   graces, and yet the apostle prays that the Lord would direct their
   hearts to the love of God.' Why?

   [1.] Because there are many defects of love in the best. To give some
   instances:--

   First, Love signifies a strong inclination, or an earnest bent of heart
   towards God, as our chief good and last end. Well, then, our end is our
   measure by which we judge of all means, of the aptness and fitness of
   what is to be avoided and embraced. The seasonableness of all means
   must be determined by the end, that all means that are inconsistent
   with and impertinent to our great end may be cut off. Now all sins are
   inconsistent with making God our great end, and all vain and foolish
   actions are impertinent thereunto. Judge you by this, if we have such a
   perfect love to God, if this be love, as questionless it is. But now
   with how many impertinent and extravagant actions do we fill up our
   lives? How many purposes, desires, words, and actions have we that have
   no respect to our great end at all? How much do we live to ourselves,
   and how little to God? How great a passion have we for earthly things,
   so that they can occupy and intercept the far greatest part of our
   lives? And then judge whether we had not need have the bent kept up,
   and the tendency towards God, as our end and happiness: Ps. lxxxvi. 11,
   Unite my heart to the fear of thy name.' It is the natural disease of
   man's heart to be loosed from God, and to be distracted in variety of
   worldly objects, which obtrude themselves upon our senses, offer
   themselves to us daily; therefore it is not enough for a man once to
   resign over his heart to God, as we do in conversion, when this love
   was first wrought in us, but we need often to beg that God would
   reclaim us from this ranging after carnal vanities, that he would
   direct and keep us straight and true to our end, that we may love him
   more, and at a better rate. So, if you consider the nature of love; the
   thing is obvious and plain, unless the Lord maintain this love in us,
   and keep it up, what will become of us?

   The second evidence is those slavish fears which do oppress us and
   hinder our delight in God and comfortable communion with him in the
   means of grace. Certainly the more we are under slavish fear, the less
   love we have to God and thankfulness for his grace. The apostle tells
   you, 1 John iv. 18, There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth
   out fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made
   perfect in love.' Surely we should seek after such a spirit of love,
   that all we do for God may be done with great delight; that we may not
   serve him by compulsion, but by inclination; not as en joined only, but
   as inclined; not as putting a force upon ourselves, but as delighting
   in our work. And then--

   Thirdly, Another instance is our frequent preferring the profits and
   pleasures of the world before the service of God, and if it doth not go
   so far as to forfeit our right, yet how often do we expose and put our
   spiritual comforts to hazard for every trifle? As Esau, that sold his
   birthright for a morsel of meat, Heb. xii. 15, 16. The best of us show
   too much lothness to cut off the right hand, and to pluck out the right
   eye, or to do that which is signified by it. This shows a weakness of
   love; for where love is strong, there is a thorough inclination to God;
   we dare love nothing above him, or against him, or without him.

   Fourthly, Our backwardness to obedience, and the tediousness we find in
   it, shows a great imperfection in our love. All goes on easily,
   sweetly, acceptably, where love is at the bottom. Gen. xxix. 20, Seven
   years to Jacob seemed as a few days, for the love that he had to
   Rachel; and so love sweetens our obedience: His commandments are not
   grievous.' But when we are wedded to worldly things, and will not be
   reclaimed from them, then every heavenly business is an interruption to
   what we would be at, what we delight in.

   Fifthly, The many conflicts we have with carnal self-love, or our own
   foolish and hurtful lusts, show our love is not perfect; as the
   weakness of faith is seen and felt by the remainders of unbelief, and
   our frequent conflicts with doubts and fears: Lord, I believe; help
   thou mine unbelief,' Mark ix. 24. So the weakness of our love is known
   by the opposition of carnal and inordinate self-love. The flesh will
   say sometimes, Favour thyself,' or What a weariness is it,' Mal. i. 13,
   and grudge everything that is done for God. It doth excuse us in our
   stragglings and deviations from our great end, and applaud us in our
   negligent course of living; as the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
   than seven men that can render a reason,' Prov. xxvi. 16. Nay,
   sometimes it will urge us to please ourselves to the grief of the
   Spirit, and to take our fill of carnal delights. All this be longs to
   the first reason.

   [2.] There needs much to be done about our love after it is planted in
   the soul; we need to get it rooted, to get it increased, to get it
   continually excited, and kept in act and exercise.

   (1.) We need to get it rooted. Our first affection to God and heavenly
   things may hastily put forth itself, as the early blossoms of the
   spring do, but they are soon nipt; and those high tides of affections,
   which we find in our first acquaintance with religion, afterwards sink
   low enough. Love is more passionately expressed at first, partly by
   reason of the novelty of the things represented to us, and partly
   because of our great necessity, as men that are in a violent thirst
   take large draughts with pleasure; and because our love is not as yet
   dispersed into the several channels of obedience, but wholly taken up
   with admirations of grace; but yet this may vanish and decay. Our
   business is to be rooted and grounded in love,' as the apostle saith,
   Eph. iii. 17, to get a more solid, durable affection to God.

   (2.) After it is planted it needs to be more increased: Phil. i. 9, I
   pray God your love may abound yet more and more.' At first love is but
   weak; there is fire, but it is not blown up into a flame; after wards
   God gets a greater interest in our hearts, and then the constitutions
   of our souls become more holy and heavenly. Love being the heart of the
   new creature, he that hath most love hath most grace, and is the best
   and strongest Christian.

   (3.) After it is planted in the soul it needs to be excited and kept in
   act and exercise. This is mainly intended here. For--

   First, All religion is in effect but love. Faith is a thankful
   acceptance of Christ, and thankfulness is an expression of love.
   Repentance is but mourning love; as she wept much to whom much was
   forgiven, Luke vii. 47. Diligence in the holy life is but seeking love;
   obedience is pleasing love; self-denial is the mortification of
   inordinate self-love; sobriety is a retrenching of our carnal love.

   Second, If love be not acted and kept at work, carnal love will
   prevail. The soul of man cannot lie idle, especially our affections
   cannot; either they are carried out to God, or they will leak out to
   worldly things. When our love ceaseth, yet concupiscence ceaseth not,
   and the love of the world will soon grow superior in the soul; for the
   neglected principle languisheth, while the other principle gets
   strength, and secures its interest to God. The--

   Third is the benefit we have by keeping love in act. This makes us more
   sincere, and to act purely for God: 2 Cor. v. 14, The love of Christ
   constrains us: for we thus judge, that they that live should no more
   live to themselves, but to him that died for them, and rose again.' The
   constraining influence of love is that that keeps us from living to
   ourselves; and this makes us more diligent. Labour and love are often
   coupled in the scripture: Knowing your labour of love, the work of
   faith and patience of hope;' and God is not unrighteous to forget your
   labour of love;' the church of Ephesus lost her first love,' she left
   her first work,' Rev. ii. 4, 5.

   Use. Oh, then, let us seek this benefit from God, that our hearts may
   be directed into his love.

   1. The sanctifying Spirit is given us for this end, to stir up love to
   God: John iv. 14, The water I will give him shall be a well of water,
   always springing up unto eternal life.' It is not in the heart a dead
   pool, but a living spring. And the same is intimated, John vii. 38, He
   that believes in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
   water; this he spake of the Spirit.'

   2. The ordinances were appointed for this end. The word, to represent
   God amiable to us, both for the goodness in him and the goodness
   proceeding from him, especially in our redemption by Christ; and also
   for those rich preparations of grace he hath made for us in another
   world to blow up this holy fire; and this is the end of the sacrament.
   All the dainties that are set before us in the Lord's Supper do all
   taste and savour of love. Our meat is seasoned with love, and our drink
   flows into our cup out of the wine-press of love. Why do we eat of the
   crucified body of Christ, but that we may remember Jesus who loved us,
   and gave himself for us?' Gal. ii. 20. And also the drink that is
   provided for us at this feast is the blood of Christ: Rev. i. 5, Who
   loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.'

   3. All the providences of God tend to this end, that we may love God;
   all God's mercies are as new fuel to keep in this fire. I will love the
   Lord, because he has heard the voice of my supplication,' Ps. cxvi. 1;
   And thou shalt love the Lord, who is the strength of thy life, and the
   length of thy days,' Deut. xxx. 20. All the mercy we have from God is
   to refresh and revive our love, that it may not languish and die; nay,
   all the sharp corrections God sends are to recover our love to God:
   Isa. xxvi. 9, My soul hath desired thee in the night,' saith the
   prophet, and early have I sought thee.' And when was that?' when thy
   judgments were abroad in the world,' when great and sharp afflictions
   were upon them.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON VII.

   And into the patient waiting for Christ.--2 Thes. III. 5.

   THE words are a prayer; and the apostle prays here for those things
   which are most necessary to Christians--love to God, and patient
   waiting for Christ.

   I come now to handle the second branch.

   The point is this:--

   Doct. That when the heart is bent by love to God, we need also the
   direction of his grace to keep it intent upon the coming of Christ.

   Four things I must speak to:--

   I. What this patient waiting for Christ is.

   II. The connection between it and the love of God.

   III. That it hath a great influence upon the spiritual life, or keeps
   religion alive in the soul.

   IV. The necessity of God's concurrence hereto: the Lord direct your
   hearts into the patient waiting for Christ.'

   I. What is this patient waiting for Christ? I answer It is the grace of
   hope fortifying our resolutions for God and the world to come, that we
   may continue in our duty till our work be finished and our warfare
   ended. The act of hope is three ways expressed: Some times by looking,
   which notes a certain expectation: Titus ii. 13, Looking for the
   blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
   Saviour.' Sometimes by loving or longing, which notes a desirous and
   earnest expectation: 2 Tim. iv. 8, Not to me only, but to all that love
   his appearing.' Sometimes by waiting, which notes a patient
   expectation, 1 Thes. i. 10. He makes it there the fruit of our
   conversion: he saith, we are turned to God, that we may wait for his
   Son from heaven.' This last notion is expressly mentioned in the text,
   the others are implied; as looking, there can be no waiting for that we
   do not look for; and longing, for delay is only troublesome to them
   that earnestly desire his coming, and build their hopes upon it. Faith
   adds certainty, and love earnestness; and both give strength to
   patience. Let us open all these things. As--

   1. Looking for the coming of Christ: Phil. iii. 20, Our conversation is
   in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
   Christ.' It is not a matter of conjecture, but of faith. Reason saith,
   He may come; but faith saith, He will come. Nature will teach us it is
   very likely, for a guilty conscience fears the judge; and the course of
   things is so disordered in the world, that there needs a review. But
   scripture tells us, it is very certain that he that shall come, will
   come, and will not tarry,' Heb. x. 37. Therefore, in the eye of faith
   it is sure and near. As Rebecca spied Isaac at a distance, so faith
   looks upon Christ as if he had begun his journey, and were now upon the
   way, and makes the believer stand ready to meet him and welcome him.
   Though it come not to pass presently, the thing is promised, and the
   time certainly determined in God's eternal purpose, which is enough for
   faith.

   2. There is a longing or a desirous expectation: 2 Peter iii. 12,
   Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.' It is good
   to observe how differently this coming of Christ is entertained in the
   world; it is questioned by the atheist, it is dreaded by the wicked and
   impenitent, but it is longingly expected by the godly.

   [1.] For the first sort: 2 Peter iii. 3, 4, There shall come in the
   last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is
   the promise of his coming?' They would eternally enjoy the pleasures of
   the present world, and therefore labour to dash all thoughts of this
   great day out of their hearts, and take up all obvious prejudices to
   smother the belief of it: they would be glad in their hearts to hear
   such news that Christ would never come. Now, their wishes do easily
   commence into opinion. Christ's coming is the burden and torment they
   would willingly get rid of; and men readily believe what they earnestly
   desire.

   [2.] The second sort. It is dreaded by the wicked and impenitent. And
   therefore hated and abhorred by them. At the mention of it Felix
   trembled, Acts xxiv. 25. There is reason for it, for Christ comes to
   them as a terrible judge. In scripture his coming is set forth by
   light, and sometimes by fire. Light is comfortable, but fire dreadful:
   2 Thes. i. 8, He shall come in flames of fire to render vengeance to
   them that obey not the gospel.' But--

   [3.] To the godly it is not matter of terror, but delight; not like the
   handwriting on the wall to Belshazzar, but like comfortable tidings to
   one that expects news from far; they long for it, and would hasten it
   if they might have their desire: Cant. viii. 14, Make haste, my
   beloved, and be like a young hart or roe upon the mountains of spices.'
   Christ is not slack, but the church's affections are strong, therefore
   she saith, Make haste. So Rev. xxii. 20, Christ saith, I come;' and the
   church, like a quick echo, takes the words out of his mouth, Even so,
   come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.' Christ's voice and the church's voice
   are unisons. You will say this is the desire of the church in general;
   but doth every particular believer so desire it? I answer--The part
   follows the reason of the whole, the same Spirit is in all the
   faithful; the Spirit in the bride says come; the Holy Ghost in
   necessary things works uniformly in all the saints, therefore he breeds
   this desire in them. The meanest, the weakest, even those that tremble
   at their own unpreparedness, have some inclination that way. There may
   be a drowsiness and indisposition, but no total extinction of the
   desire of meeting with Christ.

   3. There is waiting; and here it is expressed by its adjunct, patient
   waiting;' for patient waiting is an act of hope, as well as longing
   expectation: 1 Thes. i. 3, Knowing,' saith he, your work of faith, and
   labour of love, and patience of hope,' Faith, or a sound belief of
   things, will break out into practice; therefore the work of faith,
   love, will put us upon labour, and hope produces patience. There is a
   threefold patience spoken of in scripture; all the branches are near
   kin, for they are all begotten by hope.

   [1.] The bearing patience; which is a constancy in adversity, or a
   perseverance in our duty notwithstanding the difficulties and trials
   that we meet with in our passage to heaven: Heb. vi. 12, Be ye
   followers of them who, through faith and patience, have inherited the
   promises.' As we cannot inherit the promises without faith, so not
   without patience; for our obedience and fidelity to Christ requires not
   only labour and great pains, but courage and constancy to suffer as
   well as to do: Heb. x. 36, Ye have need of patience, that after ye have
   done the will of God you might inherit the promise.' A child of God
   cannot be without patience, because he must reckon for troubles and
   molestations. We have indeed our calms as well as our storms, many
   intermissions; but at other times God will exercise us, and show us our
   fidelity is not sufficiently tried in doing good, but before we go to
   heaven we must sometimes suffer evil. God hath something to do by us,
   and something to do with us: we must be prepared for both, to endure
   all things, and readily and willingly suffer the greatest evil, rather
   than commit the least sin, that so at length we may be accepted in the
   judgment.

   [2.] There is a waiting patience, to wait God's leisure. The evil is
   present, the good is absent; now we long for the good as well as bear
   the evil: Rom. viii. 25, But if we hope for that we see not, then do we
   with patience wait for it.' This is the work of patience, to wait; to
   refer it to the good pleasure of God when our warfare shall be
   accomplished and our troubles at an end, and our final deliverance come
   about. The time cannot be long, for what are a few years to eternity?
   This waiting patience is delivered to us under the similitude of an
   husbandman, James v. 7, who waiteth for the precious fruits of the
   earth, and hath long patience for it, till he receive the early and the
   latter rain.' The husbandman, that hath laid out all his substance in
   seed-corn, cannot hope for a present harvest, or that he should receive
   the crop as soon as the seed is cast into the ground. No; it must lie a
   while there, it must endure all weathers before it can spring up in the
   blade and ear, and ripen, and be fit to be reaped. So though we venture
   all upon our everlasting hopes, yet we must expect our season, till we
   see the fruit and recompense of it. This is the waiting patience.

   [3.] There is the working patience; which is a going on with our
   self-denying obedience, how tedious soever it be to the flesh. Thus we
   are told, the good ground bringeth forth fruit with patience.' They
   were hasty to have present satisfaction, or else grew weary of
   religion, and turned aside to worldly things. So the heirs of the
   promises are described, Rom. ii. 7, to be those that continued with
   patience in well-doing.' And to the church of Ephesus God saith, Rev.
   ii. 2, I know thy works, thy labour, and thy patience.' Religion is not
   an idle and sluggish profession, the work of it is carried on by
   diligence and faithfulness. Lusts are not easily mortified; neither do
   graces produce their perfect work with a little perfunctory care. Much
   labour and serious diligence is required of us, we have many things to
   conflict withal, there is the burden of a wearisome body, the seducing
   flesh, unruly passions, disordered thoughts, a dark mind, dead
   affections, and sometimes the misery of a troubled conscience that we
   conflict withal: and therefore we need much patience, that we may not
   faint, but be accepted of the Lord at his coming. Well, then, to live
   in this constant and patient expectation of Christ is the perpetual
   necessary duty of all those that love him.

   II. The connection and affinity between it and the love of God; for if
   a man love God, he will wait for the coming of Christ. The one is
   inferred out of the other, The Lord direct your hearts to the love of
   God, and the patient waiting for Christ.'

   1. They that love God level all their thoughts and desires to this,
   that God may be enjoyed, that God may be glorified.

   [!.] That he may be enjoyed in the fullest manner and measure they are
   capable of. Now this full enjoyment is the fruit of Christ's coming;
   then we shall be ever with the Lord,' 1 Thes. iv. 17; When Christ shall
   appear, we shall see him as he is, and be like him;' that is, like him
   in holiness, and like him in happiness. Our vision will make a
   transformation. The desire of union, which is so intrinsic to love, is
   never satisfied till then. Here we have a little of God in the midst of
   sin and misery. Sin straitens our capacity from receiving more; and God
   sees fit to exercise us with misery, only affording us an intermixture
   of heavenly comfort. But our full joy is reserved to the day of
   Christ's appearing.

   [2.] They that love God desire also that God may be glorified, that his
   truth may be vindicated, his love and justice demonstrated. His truth
   is vindicated because his threatenings and promises are all
   accomplished: sin will no more be had in honour, nor pride and
   sensuality bear sway. Love to the saints will be seen in their full
   reward, and his justice demonstrated on the wicked in their full
   punishment. All matters of faith shall then become matters of sense;
   and what is now propounded to be believed shall be felt, and God shall
   be glorified in all.

   2. The saints love Christ as Mediator; we love him now though we see
   him not: 1 Peter i. 8, Whom having not seen, we love; and believing in
   him, rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.' But desire to
   see him, as our surest and best friend. We have heard much of him, felt
   much of him, and tasted much of him, but wo desire to see him,
   especially when he shall appear in all his glory: Mat. xxv. 31, The Son
   of man shall come in his glory, and all his angels with him.' All
   clouds about his person shall vanish, he shall appear to be what he is,
   the Saviour and judge of the world.

   3. They have a love for the church; for the church in general shall at
   that day be adorned as a bride for her husband, and fully freed from
   all sin and trouble. It is no more eclipsed by its lamentable
   imperfections, corruption of worship, division of sects, or the
   persecutions of the world, nor polluted by the distempers of its
   diseased members: all is then holy and glorious. Christ will present it
   as a glorious church without spot or wrinkle, Eph. v. 27.

   4. They love themselves in God; and their own happiness is then fully
   to be perfected. All the desires and hopes of believers are then
   satisfied. They that are now scorned and persecuted shall have the
   reward of their love to God, be perfectly loved by him. A gladsome day
   it will be with God's people. 2 Thes. i. 10, it is said, Christ shall
   be admired in the saints, and glorified in all them that believe,'
   Glorified, not actively, but objectively. Poor creatures, that are
   newly crept out of the dust and rottenness, shall have so much glory
   put upon them, that the angels themselves shall stand wondering what
   Christ means to do for them. And then for all their labour they shall
   have rest, they shall rest from their labours; that is, all their
   trouble some work shall be over, for their pain and sorrow they shall
   have delight, 1 Peter iv. 12. For their shame they shall have glory put
   upon them both in body and soul. Our Lord Christ despised the shame for
   the glory set before him, Heb. xii. 2.

   III. It hath a great influence upon the spiritual life, and keeps
   religion alive in our souls. That will appear if you take either word
   in the text, waiting or patience.

   1. If you take the first notion, waiting or looking, as it draws off
   the mind from things present to things to come.

   [1.] Looking to the end of things giveth wisdom: Deut. xxxii. 29, Oh,
   that they were wise, that they would consider their latter end.' It is
   not so much to be stood upon who is happy now, but who shall be happy
   at last. If men would frequently consider this, it would much rectify
   all the mistakes in the world. If we would inure our minds not to look
   to things as they seem at present, or relish to the flesh, or appear
   now to such short-sighted creatures as we are, but as they will be
   judged of at the last day, at Christ's appearing: how soon would this
   vain show be over, and the face of things changed, and what is rich,
   and pleasant, and honourable now, appear base and contemptible at the
   latter end! Then shall we see that there is an excellency in oppressed
   godliness, that exalted wickedness and folly is but shame and ruin. Do
   but translate the scene from the world's judgment to Christ's tribunal,
   and you will soon alter your opinions concerning wisdom and folly,
   misery and happiness, liberty and bondage, shame and glory; the
   mistaking of which notions pervert all mankind, and there is no
   rectifying the mistake but by carrying of our mind seriously to the
   last review of all things: for then we shall judge things not by what
   they seem now, but by what they will be hereafter. Solomon tells us,
   Prov. xix. 20, Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest
   be wise in thy latter end.' That is true wisdom, to be found wise at
   last. Time will come when we shall wish and say in vain, Oh, that we
   had laid up treasure in heaven, that we had laboured for the meat that
   perisheth not, that we had esteemed despised holiness, that we had set
   less by all the vanities of the world, that we had imitated the
   strictest and most mortified believer, for those are only esteemed and
   have honour in that day. More particularly--

   (1.) It would much quicken us to repentance: Acts iii. 19, Repent and
   be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the day of
   refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.' All things shall
   be reviewed at Christ's coming, and some men's sins remain, and others
   are blotted out. None but those that are converted and turned to God
   can expect that benefit. Unless we be recovered from the devil, the
   world, and the flesh, and brought back again in heart and life to God,
   there will be no escape. Now those that wait for this day should
   prepare for it, that they may stand in the judgment with comfort. The
   wicked shall have judgment with out mercy, but the believer shall be
   accepted upon terms of grace. Days of torment shall come to the one
   from the presence of the Lord, and days of refreshing shall come to the
   other. The state in the world of believing penitents is a time of
   conflict, labour, and sorrow, but this trouble and toil is then over,
   and they shall enjoy their rest. Consider these things, Where would you
   have your refreshment, and in what? Many seek their refreshing now
   either in brutish pleasures, and sit down under the shadow of some
   earthly gourd, which soon withers; but those that seek their
   refreshment in the enjoyment of God shall then be satisfied. Nothing
   certainly makes us so solicitous about a serious reconciliation with
   God as the consideration of this day.

   (2.) It engageth us to holiness, and puts life into our obedience. We
   that look for such things, what manner of persons ought we to be in all
   holy conversation and godliness?' 2 Peter iii. 11. Men are secure and
   careless, either because they do not believe this day, or do not
   seriously think of it Could we bring ourselves to this, to think and
   speak and do as having judgment and eternity in our eye, we would be
   other manner of persons than ever we have been. What! believe this day,
   and be so careless! It cannot be. We would not beat down the price of
   religion to so low a rate, nor serve God so loosely, if we did wait for
   the coming of Christ, who will bring every thing into the judgment,
   whether it be good or evil. We could not then satisfy ourselves in such
   a negligent profession and practice of godliness.

   (3.) It would produce a more heavenly temper and conversation. That is
   evident from the apostle's words: Phil. iii. 20, Our conversation is in
   heaven, from whence we look for a Saviour.' Looking for this salvation
   and this Saviour, it breeds in us the heavenly mind. He comes from
   heaven to bring us thither; for he comes to receive us to himself, John
   xiv. 3. Therefore if we be not heavenly, our practice will be a
   contradiction to our faith. You believe that there is a God and a
   Christ and a life to come; that this Christ came from God to bring us
   to God, that we may enjoy him in the life to come; and thereupon you
   renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and give up yourselves to
   God, believing that this Christ will come again to lead all his sincere
   disciples and penitent believers into the glory and happiness of the
   heavenly state. If you believe this, what follows? That your
   conversation must be heavenly, either you must live for heaven, as
   seeking it with all diligence, that you may at length certainly obtain
   it, and not be excluded with the wicked, or live upon heaven, solacing
   yourselves in the foresight and hopes of it. Otherwise, to profess this
   faith, and yet to live as though your happiness were altogether in this
   world, were to go about to reconcile contra dictions; to pretend you
   place your blessedness in heaven, and yet fly from it as a misery. You
   profess to look and long for that you have no mind to. The second
   notion is patience.

   2. Patience, that also hath a great influence upon religion; for that
   which destroyeth all religion and godliness is making haste. Therefore
   it is said, Isa. xxviii. 16, He that believes, shall not make haste,'
   God's promises are not presently effected; and if we cannot tarry, but
   run to our own shifts, because they are next at hand, presently you run
   into a snare. On the other side it is said, Lam. iii. 26, It is good to
   hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of God.' When we can hope
   and wait, it mightily secures our obedience. Sense is all for present
   satisfaction, but faith and hope can tarry God's leisure, till those
   better things which he hath promised do come in hand. Whatever our
   condition be, afflicted or prosperous, we are in the place and station
   where God hath set us, and there we must abide till he bring us to his
   kingdom. Impatience and precipitation is the cause of all mischief.
   What moved the Israelites to make a golden calf, but impatience, not
   waiting for Moses, who, according to their mind and fancy, remained too
   long with God in the mount? What made Saul force himself to offer
   sacrifice, but because he could not tarry an hour longer for Samuel,
   and so lost the kingdom? 1 Sam. xiii. 12-14. What made the bad servant,
   or church officer, to smite his fellow-servant, and eat and drink with
   the drunken, that is, to abuse church censures, countenance the
   profane, and smite and curb the godly, but only this? Mat. xxiv. 48, My
   Lord delays his coming.' He sees the strictest are hated in the world,
   and the others befriended; and honour and interest runs that way, and
   Christ comes not to rectify these disorders. My Lord delays his
   coming.' Hasty men are loth to be kept in suspense and long
   expectation, and so miscarry. Look to all sorts of sinners. The carnal
   and sensual, they cannot wait for the time when they shall have
   pleasures for evermore at God's right hand, therefore take up with
   present delights. Like those who cannot tarry till the grapes be ripe,
   therefore eat them sour and green. Solid and everlasting pleasures they
   cannot wait for, therefore choose the pleasures of sin, that are but
   for a season. A covetous man will wax rich in a day, and cannot tarry
   the fair leisure of providence; therefore we are told, He that makes
   haste to be rich cannot be innocent,' Prov. xxviii. 20. An ambitious
   man will not stay till God gives true crowns and honours in his
   kingdom, and therefore he must have honour and greatness here, though
   his climbing and affecting to be built one storey higher in the world
   cost him the ruin and loss of his soul. All revolt and apostasy from
   God proceeds from hence, because they cannot wait for God's help, and
   tarry his fulfilling the promise; but finding themselves pressed and
   destitute, the flesh, that is tender and delicate, grows impatient. It
   is tedious to suffer for a while, but they do not consider it is more
   tedious to suffer for evermore. Thence comes also our murmuring and
   distrustful repining: Ps. xxxi. 22, I said in my haste, I am cut off;
   nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplication.' Just at that
   time when God was about to hear him. So, I said in my haste, All men
   are liars.' And thence also our unlawful attempts, and stepping out of
   God's way. Men fly to unwarrantable means, because they cannot depend
   upon God, and wait with patience. Look, as an impetuous river is always
   troubled and thick, so is. a precipitate, impatient spirit out of
   order, full of distemper, a ready prey to Satan.

   IV. The necessity of divine concurrence. The apostle prays here, The
   Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the patient waiting
   for Christ.' It concerns this clause as well as the former.

   1. As to the carnal and unregenerate. Till their hearts be changed,
   they can never attain to this patient waiting for Christ, for two
   reasons:--

   [1.] In the wicked there is no sound belief of these things, for they
   live by sense and not by faith. The apostle tells us, He that lacketh
   grace is blind, and cannot see afar off,' 2 Peter i. 9. Things of
   another world are too uncertain, and too far off for them to apprehend,
   so as to be much moved by them. They hear of the coming of Christ, and
   speak by rote of it after others, but they do not believe it;
   therefore, till God enlighten them, how shall they be affected with
   this matter?

   [2.] There is an utter unsuitableness of heart to them. Things present,
   that suit their fancies and please their senses, carry away their
   hearts. Ps. xlix. 18, Whilst he lived he blessed his soul; and men will
   praise thee when thou doest well to thyself.' Men bless themselves, and
   the carnal world applauds them in a sensual course and way of living.
   They measure all happiness by their outward condition in the world, and
   please themselves with golden dreams of contentment; and this being
   seconded with the flattery and applauses of the deceived world, they
   are fast asleep in the midst of the greatest soul-dangers, and so go
   down into hell before they think of it.

   2. Come we now to the regenerate. Such the apostle looks upon the
   Thessalonians to be. They need to have their hearts directed to the
   patient waiting for Christ, for these reasons:--

   [1.] Because we have too dim and doubtful a foresight of these things.
   How dark a prospect have even the best of God's children of the world
   to come! We may speak of others as unbelievers, but God knows how
   doubtful our own thoughts are about eternity and Christ's coming; how
   little we can shut the eye of sense, and open that of faith, and say
   truly with the apostle, 2 Cor. iv. 18, We look not at the things that
   are seen, that are temporal; but to the things unseen, that are
   eternal.' Alas! we have no through sight into another world. The best
   Christians have need to have their eyes anointed with spiritual
   eye-salve, that their sight may be more sharp and piercing; to beg the
   spirit of wisdom and revelation, to open the eyes of their mind, that
   they may see what is the hope of Christ's calling,' Eph. i. 17, 18.
   There are too many intervening clouds between us and eternity, that
   darken our sight and obscure our faith.

   [2.] Our thoughts of these things are strange and dull, and too rare
   and unfrequent. How seldom have we any serious thoughts of his coming,
   and how unwelcome are they to our hearts! It was a complaint against
   Israel, that they did put far away the evil day; but the complaint
   against us may be taken up thus, that we put far away the good day,
   when all our desires and hopes shall be accomplished and satisfied. The
   atheistical world deny it, and we forget it. Solomon saith to the
   sensual young man, Remember, that for all these things God shall bring
   thee to judgment.' Young men forget or put off these thoughts, lest,
   like cold water cast into a boiling pot, they should check the fervour,
   of their lusts. But, alas! grave men, good men, forget these things.
   When Christ had spoken of his coming to judgment, he saith, Mark xiii.
   37, What I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.' Watching is keeping up
   this attentiveness to his second coming with all Christian vigilance
   and endeavour. But few regard the charge: therefore the Lord direct
   your hearts,' &c.

   [3.] Because our affections are so cold, and we are no more affected
   with it, but as if we were senseless of the weight of these things.
   Some dead and drowsy desires we have, but not that lively motion which
   will become hope and love. If nature say, Come not to torment us before
   the time,' grace should say, Come, Lord Jesus, oh, come quickly.' We
   are not only to look for his appearing, but to love his appearing.
   Where are these desires, that Christ would either come down to us, or
   take us up to himself, that we may live with him for ever?

   [4.] This prayer need to be made for the renewed too, because
   Christians think of it with too much perplexity and fear, Is the sight
   of a Saviour unwelcome to you? or should the drawing nigh of your
   redemption be a comfort or a terror? Why do you then believe in Christ,
   and choose his favour for your happiness? We thought that this had been
   all your hope, and your desire, and your great comfort; and shall your
   hope be your torment, and beget horror rather than joy? Oh, beg the
   Lord to direct your hearts, that you may hope to the end for the grace
   that shall be brought unto you at the revelation of the Lord Jesus
   Christ,' 1 Peter i. 13. We do not only wait for glory, but for grace;
   and shall not this be a comfort to you?

   [5.] We need to pray this prayer, because our preparations are too
   slender for so great a day. Serious preparation is necessary. It is
   described 2 Peter iii. 14, Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
   such things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without
   spot, and blameless;' that is, in a state of reconciliation with God.
   But we live too securely and quietly, in an unprepared state. If we
   have the habitual preparation, we do not keep up the actual preparation
   by clarifying and refining our souls from the dregs of sense, by
   honouring God in the world with greater earnestness, that when our Lord
   comes, he may find us so doing. We do not stand with our loins girt,
   and our lamps burning,' that when the Lord knocks we may open to him
   immediately. We do not keep up the heavenly desire, the actual
   readiness. The return of a husband after long absence is more welcome
   to the wife than to a harlot; but she would have all things ready for
   his reception and entertainment.

   [6.] Because our motions are too inconstant. We interrupt the course of
   our obedience frequently, faint in our afflictions, do not keep up the
   fervour of our affections, and follow after salvation with that
   industrious diligence. We need often the Christian watchword, The Lord
   is at hand.' We lose much of our first love, intermit of our first
   works. Therefore, The Lord direct your hearts to the patient waiting
   for Christ.'

   The exhortation is to quicken you to take care of this grace, that you
   may be constantly exercised in it. While we are upon earth, we should
   continually be expecting Christ's coming from heaven. The motives may
   be these:--

   1. Before Christ's coming in the flesh, the saints waited for him. I
   have waited for thy salvation, O Lord,' saith Jacob, Gen. xlix. 18. And
   Simeon for Christ, the Saviour of the world; for so it is explained,
   Mine eyes have seen thy salvation.' And our Lord tells us, Abraham
   rejoiced to see my day,' John viii. 56; and it is said of Anna and
   others, that they waited for the consolation of Israel,' Luke ii. 25,
   38. And after Christ was come, the disciples were commanded to wait for
   the promise of the Spirit,' Acts i. 4. So, by parity of reason, we must
   wait for the coming of Christ; for that is the next great promise to be
   accomplished, and the great thing to put life into our religion.

   2. The people of God are described by this, 1 Thes. i. 10, Who wait for
   his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which
   delivered us from the wrath to come.' A man would have thought, in
   those early days, they should have been described by their respect to
   what was past rather than to what was to come, which was at so great a
   distance: they should have been described by believing Christ was
   already come in the flesh, rather than waiting for his coming in glory.
   No; this is proposed as an evidence of their sincerity and
   Christianity, Waiting for the coming of Christ.' And so it is said,
   Heb. ix. 28, That Christ would appear unto the salvation of them that
   look for him.' That is the property of true believers. But they that
   look not for his coming, love not, and long not for his coming, cannot
   expect his salvation. It is an allusion to the people, who, upon the
   day of expiation, when the high priest went into the holiest before the
   mercy-seat, were waiting for his coming out, that he might solemnly
   bless them. So must we look for Christ's return, now he is gone within
   the veil of the heavenly sanctuary, that he may come out and bless us
   with everlasting blessings.

   3. This should move us to it, the benefits that will come to us hereby;
   for this waiting for Christ breeds in us contempt of the world,
   mortification of the flesh, tolerance and enduring of the cross.

   [1.] It breeds in us contempt of the world; because we look for higher
   and better things to be dispensed to us when Christ comes. Set not your
   affections on things on earth, but on things in heaven.' Why? For your
   life is hid with Christ in God. And when Christ, who is our life, shall
   appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 2-4.
   The more the heart is given to one, the other gets the less. Earthly
   things be little regarded in comparison of that glorious state, both of
   soul and body, which we shall have at Christ's appearance.

   [2.] This conduceth to the mortification of the flesh; therefore we
   deny ourselves present satisfactions, that we may not be castaways,
   disallowed in the judgment. Be sober, and hope to the end, for the
   grace that is to be brought to you at the coming of Christ,' 1 Peter i.
   13.

   [3.] The tolerance and enduring of the cross. This gives a quiet temper
   in all troubles. We may suffer now, but when Christ shall appear, we
   shall rejoice with exceeding joy,' 1 Peter iv. 13. And then our reward
   will very much exceed the proportion of our sufferings; they are no
   more to be set against them than a feather against a talent of lead. I
   reckon they are not worthy to be compared,' saith the apostle, Rom.
   viii. 18. It would be a disgrace to a man's reason that these things
   should bear any competition with our great hopes: these light
   afflictions, that are but for a moment,' with that exceeding weight of
   glory,' Christ shall bestow upon us.

   For means, all I shall say is this: if you wait for Christ's coming,
   look upon it as sure and as near: Rev. xxii. 12, Behold, I come
   quickly, and bring my reward with me.' We have the promise of the
   eternal God for it, so attested, and made out to us with such evidence,
   that we have no reason to doubt of the recompenses of religion. But
   things at a distance, though never so great, will not leave a due
   impression upon us: therefore we must look upon this promise with a
   certainty of persuasion that it will not be long before its
   accomplishment. Thus faith lessens the distance between hope and
   enjoyment, and enables us comfortably to wait.

SERMON VIII.

   Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence.--Eph.
   I. 8.

   IN the context the apostle speaks of the spiritual blessings we have by
   Christ: he considers them under a threefold reference;--(1.) As they
   were appointed and prepared for believers in God's decree of election.
   There was the first stone laid towards this building. (2.) As they were
   purchased by Christ in the great and wonderful work of redemption. (3.)
   As conveyed and applied to us in effectual calling, and so brought home
   to our souls. In all these God gave evident proofs of the riches of his
   free grace. For (1st,) If he chose us to be holy before the foundations
   of the world,' nothing anteceded his love; not in us--for there was
   nothing in being then; we were not, and so could do nothing to deserve
   it--nor in that prospect and foresight which God had of things; for he
   could foresee nothing but what was the effect of his free grace: not
   because holy, but that we might be holy and without blame before him in
   love.' (2dly,) Consider his purpose to bring about all this by Christ,
   still he showed his free grace. For when there was nothing to move him,
   much to hinder the design of his grace, yet he found out a way to bring
   this about by Christ. (3dly,) In the effectual application to us, who
   were ignorant, obstinate, unbelieving, his grace doth more shine forth
   that he would do all this for creatures so much unworthy. Now, in the
   application, God discovers two things;--(1.) His abundant favour, or
   the riches of his grace, ver. 7. That his love, so long hid in his
   decree, did after wards overflow in the effects to persons so averse
   and unworthy. (2.) His excellent wisdom in the text, Wherein he hath
   abounded to us in all wisdom and prudence.'

   The only difficulty in the words is, What is this wisdom and prudence
   spoken of? Whether it imply the wisdom of God, or the wisdom wrought in
   us by the Spirit in conversion? Many interpreters go for the last. The
   former, I suppose, is here meant, which is eminently discovered in the
   mysteries of the gospel: Rom. xi. 33, Oh the depth of the riches both
   of the wisdom and knowledge of God!' Surely it is not meant of wisdom
   in us; for how little a portion have we of true and heavenly wisdom.
   Now, the two words used: wisdom noteth the sublimity of the doctrine of
   the gospel, and prudence the usefulness of it. As Prov. viii. 12, I,
   wisdom, dwell with prudence,' which showeth there is some distinction
   between those words. It was wisdom to find out a way of recovering
   lapsed mankind, and it was prudence to dispose it into so good and
   convenient order that it might be commodious for our acceptance. If any
   think it relateth to the effects wrought in us, I am not against it.
   Christ is wisdom, 1 Cor. i. 24, and made wisdom' to us, 1 Cor. i. 30.
   These Asiatics, to whom the apostle wrote, gloried in their secular
   wisdom and curious arts; now the true wisdom was found in the mysteries
   of the gospel.

   Doct. That in the dispensation of grace by Christ, God hath showed
   great wisdom and prudence.

   When his grace overflowed to us, he showed therein not only his
   goodness but his wisdom. Now, though we can easily yield to this
   assertion, yet to make it out needeth more skill. The manifold wisdom
   of God' is better seen to angels than to us, Eph. iii. 10. They have
   more orderly understandings; whereas we are confused and dark. Yet to
   discover it to you in a few particulars, the grace of the Redeemer may
   be considered three ways:--

   I. As to the purchase and impetration of it by the incarnation and
   death of the Son of God.

   II. The publication of it in the gospel or covenant of grace.

   III. The application of it to particular believers. In all these God
   hath shown great wisdom.

   I. As to the purchase and impetration of grace by the death and
   incarnation of the Son of God.

   1. There is wisdom in this, that in our fallen estate we should not
   come immediately to God without a mediator and reconciler. God is out
   of the reach of our commerce, being at such a distance from us, and
   variance with us. The wise men of the world pitched on such a way, 1
   Cor. viii. 5, 6. The heathens saw so far that it was an uncomfortable
   thing to make their immediate approaches to their supreme God. But here
   is the true God and the true Mediator: But to us there is but one God,
   the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus
   Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.' One God, the Father,
   from whom we derive all graces, to whom we direct all services; one
   Lord, Jesus Christ, who conveyeth the graces and benefits to us, and
   returneth our prayers and acts of obedience to God. This is a mighty
   relief to our thoughts; for the apprehensions of the pure Godhead do
   amaze us and confound us when we come to consider of that glorious and
   infinite being. As heretofore, before they found out the use of the
   compass, they only coasted, as loth to venture themselves in the great
   ocean; so by Christ we come to God. He is the true Jacob's ladder, John
   i. 51.

   2. That this Mediator is God in our nature. Therein the wisdom of God
   appeared, in crossing and counterworking Satan's design. Satan's great
   design was double--to dishonour God, and depress the nature of man.
   (1.) To dishonour God to man by a false representation, as if he were
   envious of man's happiness: Gen. iii. 5, God doth know in the day that
   ye eat thereof your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
   knowing good and evil.' His first battery was against the goodness of
   God, to weaken the esteem thereof. Now, by the incarnation of Christ,
   the Lord's grace is wonderfully manifested. He is represented as lovely
   and amiable in our eyes, not envying our holiness and happiness, but
   promoting it, and that at the most costly rate, and showing love to man
   above all his other creatures. God is love,' 1 John iv. 8. It is
   eminently demonstrated to us in the Son of God assuming our nature and
   dying for us, Rom. v. 8. When Christ was incarnate, love was incarnate.
   Love walked up and down and healed all sicknesses and diseases, love
   died, and love hung on a cross, love was buried in the grave. When that
   ill representation was suggested to us, it was necessary there should
   be some eminent demonstration of the love of God to man. Especially
   after we had made ourselves liable to his wrath, and were conscious to
   ourselves that we had incurred his displeasure; and so it was necessary
   that we should have some notable discovery of his philanthropy, or love
   to mankind. Many believers are harassed with doubts and fears, and
   cannot come to be persuaded that God loves them. Herein is love,' and
   God commended his love to us in that his Son died for us.' (2.) The
   next design of Satan was to depress the nature of man, which in its
   innocence stood so near to God. Now that the human nature, so depressed
   and debased by the malicious suggestion of the tempter, should be so
   elevated and advanced, and set up so far above the angelical nature,
   and admitted to dwell with God in a personal union, it is a mighty
   counter-working of Satan, and showeth the great wisdom of God. When he
   laboured to put God and us asunder, the Lord sent his Son, who took the
   unity of our nature into his own person.

   3. That being in our nature, he would set us a pattern of obedience by
   his holy life; for he lived by the same laws that we are bound to live
   by. He imposed no duty upon us but what he underwent himself, that he
   might be an example of holiness unto us. We learn of him obedience to
   God at the dearest rates; contempt of the world, and contentation with
   a low and mean estate, and to be lowly and meek in heart, Mat. xi. 29.
   Now man being so prone to imitation, it is the greatest effect of the
   wisdom of God thus to oblige us, unless we would be utterly unlike him
   whom we own as our Lord, and from whom we have all our hopes and
   expectations.

   4. That he should die the death of the cross to expiate our sins. Gal.
   iii. 13, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
   a curse for us,' &c.; Phil. ii. 8, He humbled himself, and be came
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross;' that the justice of
   God might be eminently demonstrated, the lawgiver vindicated, and the
   breach that was made in the frame of government repaired, and God might
   keep up his just honour without prejudice to his people's happiness,
   that he might be manifested to be holy, and a hater of sin, and yet the
   sinner saved from destruction, Rom. iii. 25, 26. An absolute pardon
   without satisfaction might have exposed God's laws to contempt, as if
   the violation of them were not much to be stood upon; therefore God
   dispensed his grace with all wisdom and prudence; would show eminent
   mercy, but withal a demonstration of his justice and holiness, that the
   world might still be kept in awe, and there might be a full concord and
   harmony between his mercy and justice.

   5. That after his death he should rise from the dead and ascend into
   heaven, to prove the reality of the life to come, 1 Peter iii. 21.
   Guilty man is fallen under the power and fear of death, strangely
   haunted with doubts about the other world; therefore did Christ in our
   nature arise from the dead and ascend into heaven, that he might give a
   visible demonstration of the visible resurrection, and life to come,
   which he had promised to us; and so encourage us, by a life of patience
   in sufferings, to follow after him into those blessed mansions. So that
   from first to last you see the wisdom of God.

   II. The publication of it in the gospel or covenant of grace. It is
   ordered in all things and sure,' 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. The messengers by
   whom it is published are not extraordinary ones, but men of like
   passion with ourselves. The great thing in a minister is love to souls.
   Christ saith, he came not to be ministered unto but to minister.' In
   the covenant of grace, you see the wisdom of God in two things;--(1.)
   The privileges offered; (2.) The terms or duties required.

   1. In the privileges offered to us, which are pardon and life. In these
   benefits, pardon and life, there is due provision made for the desires,
   necessities and wants of mankind. Pardon answereth the fears of the
   guilty creature; and life, those desires of happiness which are so
   natural to us, and therefore are the most powerful and inviting motives
   to draw our hearts to God.

   [1.] The consciousness of God's displeasure, and the fear of his wrath,
   should make offers of pardon acceptable to us. When sin entered into
   the world, fear entered with sin. The grand scruple which haunteth the
   guilty creature is, how God shall be appeased, and the controversy
   taken up between us and his justice: Micah vi. 6, 7, Wherewith shall he
   be appeased, and what shall I give for the sin of my soul?' We fear
   death and punishment from a holy and just God, and this is the bottom
   cause of all our troubles. Therefore till the forgiveness of sin be
   procured for us, and represented to us upon commodious terms, we know
   not how to get rid of this bondage, the justice of the supreme governor
   of the world will be ever dreadful to us. These fears may be for a
   while stifled in men, but they will ever and anon return upon us. Now
   let us admire the wisdom of God, who hath provided such a suitable
   remedy to our disease as reconciliation and remission of sins by Jesus
   Christ; and that God showed himself so ready to pardon us, who are so
   obnoxious to his wrath and vindictive justice.

   [2.] The other great privilege offered in the covenant is eternal life,
   which suiteth with those desires of happiness which are so natural to
   us. Corrupt nature is not against the offers of felicity; we would have
   immunity, peace, comfort, glory; none would be against his own benefit,
   but every one would be willing to be freed from the curse of the law,
   and the flames of hell, and enjoy happiness for evermore. Though we be
   unwilling to deny the flesh, and renounce the credit, pleasure, and
   profit of sin, and grow dead to the world, and worldly things, yet
   never was there a creature heard of that would not be happy, for there
   was never a creature but loved himself. Now, the Lord in his covenant
   hath brought life and immortality to light,' settled our happiness and
   the way to it; he promises that which we desire, to induce us to that
   which we are against. As we sweeten pills to children, that they may
   swallow them down the better, they love the sugar though they loathe
   the aloes. God would invite us to our duty by our interest; he hath
   told us of a happiness full, sure, and near, that he may draw us off
   from the false happiness wherewith we are enchanted, and bring us into
   the way of holiness, that we may look after this blessed hope.

   2. The terms he hath required of us. The terms are either for entrance,
   or making covenant with God; or continuance, or keeping covenant with
   God; for entrance, faith, and repentance are required.

   [1.] Faith in Christ. The world thinks faith quits reason and
   introduceth fond credulity. No; there is much of the wisdom of God to
   be seen in it. For faith hath a special aptitude and fitness for this
   work;--(1.) Partly in respect of God. For he having designed to glorify
   his mercy and free grace, and to make our salvation from first to last
   a mere gift, and the fruit of his love to us, hath appointed faith for
   the acceptance of this gift: Rom. iv. 16, It is of faith, that it might
   be by grace.' Faith and grace go always together, and it is put in
   opposition to the merit of works, or the strictness of the old
   covenant. (2.) As it is fittest to own Christ the Redeemer, the
   fountain of life and happiness, and our head and husband, whom we
   receive, and to whom we are united and married by faith. (3.) With
   respect to the promises of the gospel, which offer to us a happiness
   and blessedness, spiritual, and for the most part future. Unseen things
   are properly objects of faith: Heb. xi. 1, Faith is the substance of
   things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.' (4.) It is fittest
   as to our future obedience, that it may be comfortable and willing.
   Now, we owning Christ in a way of subjection and dependence, and
   consenting to become his disciples and subjects, other duties come on
   the more easily, 2 Cor. viii. 5.

   [2.] For repentance. This is the most lively and powerful means of
   bringing men to new life and blessedness. (1.) It is most for the
   honour of God that we should not be pardoned without submission,
   without confession of past sin, and resolution of future obedience.
   Common reason will tell us that our case is not compassionable while we
   are impenitent, and hold it out against God. Who will pity those in
   misery who are unwilling to come out of it? Besides, it would infringe
   the honour of God's law and government that one continuing in his sins,
   and despising both the curse of the law and the grace of the gospel,
   should be pardoned and saved. Repentance is often called a giving glory
   to God: Mal. ii. 2, Ye will not lay it to heart, and give glory to my
   name;' Josh. vii. 19, My son, give glory to God, and make confession to
   him;' Rev. xvi. 9, They repented not to give glory to God.' Repentance
   restoreth God's honour to him, as it acknowledges the justice of his
   laws. The self-condemning sinner acknowledges that God may destroy him,
   and if he save him it is mere mercy. (2.) The duty of the creature is
   best secured, and the penitent person more bound to future obedience,
   by the vow itself, or the bond of the holy oath into which he is
   entered, and the circum stances accompanying it, which surely induce a
   hatred of sin and a love of holiness. There will be a hearty consent to
   live in the love, obedience, and service of our Creator, with a
   detestation of our former ways. When we feel the smart of sin, such a
   sense of it will ever stick by us; and when we are in the deepest and
   freshest sense of his pardoning mercy, when we see at how dear rates he
   is pleased to have us, and upon what free terms to pardon all our
   wrongs, we shall love much, Luke vii. 47. Surely they that are brought
   back from the gibbet and the very gates of hell by such an act of
   pardoning mercy are most likely to remember the vows of their distress,
   and are more engaged to love God and please him than others are. (3.)
   It is most for the comfort of the creature that a stated course of
   recovering ourselves into the peace and hope of the gospel should be
   appointed to us, which may leave the greatest sense upon our
   consciences. Now what is likely to do so much as this apparent change,
   whereby we renounce and utterly bewail our former folly, and solemnly
   devote and give up ourselves to God by Christ? Those things that are
   serious and advised leave a notice and impression upon the soul. This
   is the most important action of our lives, the settling of our pardon
   and eternal interest. The heart is hardly brought to this, to renounce
   what we dearly love; therefore it is usually rewarded with some notable
   tastes of God's love: Isa. lvii. 15, God delights to revive the hearts
   of his contrite ones.'

   For continuance in the new covenant, and delightful obedience unto God.
   The remedy is not only suited to the disease, but the duty to the
   reward. Our duty is to know God, and to love him; and our reward is to
   see him, and be like him, 1 John iii. 2. There is a marvellous
   suitableness between the end and means, holiness and happiness,
   conformity to God, and our communion with him; the holiness required of
   us now, and the happiness we expect hereafter; perfect conformity and
   uninterrupted communion; and they differ only but as the bud and the
   flower, the river and the ocean: here it is begun, hereafter perfected.

   III. In the application of his grace to particular believers, he hath
   abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence.

   1. In the way God taketh to convert souls to himself, there is a sweet
   contemperation and mixture of wisdom and power. There is a proposal of
   truth and good to the understanding and the will, and by the secret
   power of his grace it is made effectual. We are taught and drawn: John
   vi. 44, 45, No man can come unto me, except the Father, which hath sent
   me, draw him.' In the 45th verse, And they shall be all taught of God.
   Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh
   unto me.' There is opening of blind eyes, and the turning of a hard
   heart: Acts xxvi. 18, To open their eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light,' &c.; Eph. i. 18, The eyes of the understanding
   being opened,' &c.; Col. iii. 10, Renewed in knowledge.' Turning the
   heart: Acts xvi. 14, God opened the heart of Lydia;' Acts xi. 21, The
   hand of the Lord was with him; and a great number believed, and turned
   to the Lord.' His hand implieth his power. Thus God worketh strongly,
   like himself; sweetly, with respect to us, that he may not oppress the
   liberty of our faculties. Christ comes into the heart, not by force,
   but by consent. We are transformed,' but so as we prove what the will
   of God is,' Rom. xii. 2. He draweth, we run, Cant. i. 4. The power of
   God and liberty of man do sweetly consist together. As God is said to
   create in us a new heart,' he is also said to give us a free spirit,'
   Ps. li. 10, 12. Eph. ii. 10, We are said to be his workmanship, created
   in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we
   should walk in them.' So he puts a new heart,' and we are said to walk
   in his ways,' Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, A new heart will I also give you,
   and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony
   heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I
   will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes;
   and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.' Thus God showeth forth
   the powerful efficacy of his grace, and doth also win the consent and
   good liking of the sinner; he obtaineth his effect, and yet doth
   preserve the liberty of man's nature and the principles thereof. It is
   not only voluntas mota, but mutata; the nature is changed and renewed.
   2 Cor. iii. 18, But we all with open face, beholding, as in a glass,
   the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to
   glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.'

   2. In the persuasive and moral way, the wisdom of God is seen as taking
   the most likely course to gain the heart of man, discovering himself to
   us as a God of love, kindness, and mercy. Guilty creatures stand aloof
   from a condemning God; our fear of his justice maketh us run from him:
   Gen. iii. 7, 10, Adam hid himself from the presence of the Lord.' So
   all his posterity forsake God and hate him. But God, though the
   superior, though the wronged party, maketh offers of peace, and showeth
   how willing he is to be reconciled to us. Having first laid the
   foundation in the highest demonstration of goodness that ever could
   come to the ears of man to hear of, or enter into the heart of man to
   conceive; namely, in giving his Son to die for a sinful world, 2 Cor.
   v. 19, 20. What more apt to make man relent? And then, because man had
   fallen from the love of God to the creature, Jer. ii. 13, what wisdom
   doth God show, not only in the offers of pardon, but eternal life and
   blessedness, infinitely beyond the false happiness which carnal
   self-love inclineth us to! that it is a shame and disgrace to our
   reason to think these things are worthy to be compared together. What
   are all the pleasures, profits, and honours we dote upon, to the
   pleasures at God's right hand? the riches of the inheritance of the
   saints, and the glory which cometh from God. And therefore, what more
   powerful motive can be produced than this blessed immortality? Indeed,
   God is invisible, and the glory is to come; and sensual pleasures are
   at hand, ready to be enjoyed. But faith checketh sense: Heb. xi. 1,
   Faith is the evidence of things not seen.' Oh the wisdom of God in the
   frame of the gospel!

   3. In the effect itself, the new creature, which is the wisest creature
   on this side heaven. To evidence this to you, I shall show you that all
   wisdom and prudence consisteth in three things;--(1.) In fixing a right
   end; (2.) In the choice of apt and proper means; (3.) In a dexterous
   effectual prosecution of the end by those means.

   (1.) In fixing and propounding to ourselves a right end. A wise man
   doth not mind trifles, but is conversant about things of the greatest
   reality, necessity, and excellency: such are God and heaven. All other
   wisdom will prove but folly in the end. Others disquiet themselves
   about a vain show,' Ps. xxxix. 6. Poor, silly creatures cark and labour
   and turmoil to get together a few poor transitory enjoyments, where
   there is neither durable possession nor solid satisfaction. The
   honours, pleasures, and riches of the world are but pictures and
   shadows of the true honours, the true riches, and fulness of joy at
   God's right hand. Surely he is a wise man that chooseth God for his
   portion and heaven for his home: Prov. xv. 24, The way of life is above
   to the wise, to avoid hell beneath.' He is wise, and hath chosen the
   true sort of living, which mindeth the salvation of his soul, and
   looketh after eternal life. Surely this is above and beyond any wisdom
   man can pretend unto, to be happy, not for a while, but for ever.

   (2.) In the choice of apt and proper means. A man is wise enough if he
   knows his duty, and the way to happiness. God hath appointed us the way
   wherein to walk, to fear him, and love him, and keep his commandments:
   Deut. iv. 6, Keep these statutes, for this is your wisdom;' Job xxviii.
   28, The fear of God, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil, that is
   understanding.' There is an excellency in this sort of life, Prov. xii.
   26. Those applaud it that do not choose it. All are of this mind at
   last, and dying are sensible of the excellency of it.

   (3.) A dexterous effectual prosecution of the end. This prosecution
   imports--First, Diligence: He is a fool that hath a price in his hand
   and hath not a heart to lay it out on a good purchase, Prov. xvii. 16;
   but he is a wise man that improveth his time and labour to a good
   purpose: A wise man's heart is at his right hand,' Eccles. x. 2.
   Secondly, This prosecution lies in caution and circumspection to keep
   himself from sin: Eph. v. 15, See then that ye walk circumspectly, not
   as fools, but as wise,' Lastly, It consists in self-denial. The wise
   merchant sold all that he had for the pearl of price, Mat. xiii. 46,
   47. A wise man doth not dally with religion, but thoroughly sets
   himself to it.

   Use 1. Be persuaded that serious Christianity is the true wisdom; and
   the wisdom of the world, which is only conversant about worldly things,
   from a worldly principle to a worldly end, is foolishness with God.
   This is wisdom, which acquainteth us more with God, and leadeth us into
   everlasting happiness.

   2. Admire the wisdom of God in dispensing salvation by Christ, who
   could bring light out of darkness, and so great a demonstration of his
   glory out of man's sin, and vanquish Satan by the way, whereby he
   seemed most to prevail, and still attain his end by means seemingly
   contrary. There is more of divine power and wisdom showed in Christ
   crucified than in anything men could think of. It was a more glorious
   act of power to raise Christ from the dead, than in not permitting him
   to die. He prevaileth more by laying down his life, than by being
   prosperous in the world and taking the lives of his enemies.

   3. If God hath abounded to us in all wisdom, let us not disturb the
   order of this grace by asking privileges without duties, or minding
   duties without the help of the Spirit; or placing all in duties, so as
   to exclude the merit and satisfaction of the Redeemer; or to eye the
   ransom so as to exclude the example of Christ. All things are well
   ordered in God's covenant; the confusion arises from our darkness and
   misapprehensions.

   4. There should be wisdom and prudence in us, for the impression must
   be according to the seal and stamp. Wisdom is a saving knowledge of
   divine mysteries; and prudence, to regulate and order our actions and
   practices, to perform our respective duties to God and man. The apostle
   prays for the Colossians (Col. i. 9), that they might be filled with
   the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.'
   All have not the same measure of saving knowledge and prudence, yet the
   least saint hath what is necessary to salvation. You must every day
   grow in those graces, for by degrees they are carried on towards
   perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON IX.

   And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
   Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me?--Mat. XXVII. 46.

   IN the history of the passion you will find that our Lord Jesus was
   exercised with all kind of temptations; affronted by men, assaulted by
   the powers of darkness, deserted by his own disciples--one of them
   denied him, another betrayed him, but all fled. And thus he was not
   only rejected of men,' but was stricken, and smitten, and forsaken of
   God. This was as gall and vinegar to his wounds, the passion of his
   passion. The world's cruelty and Satan's rage had been nothing, if the
   brightness of the divine presence had not been eclipsed. When the
   people were set against him--His blood be upon us and our children'--he
   complained not of that. When friend and lover were afar off,' he doth
   not complain of that. Judas, why hast thou betrayed me? Peter, why hast
   thou denied me? Disciples, why have ye forsaken me? But when God was
   withdrawn, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' This is his
   bitter complaint now.

   The words, then, are Christ's complaint, not of God, but to God. In
   them observe:--

   1. The circumstance of time when this complaint was made: about the
   ninth hour.

   2. The matter of it: God had forsaken him.

   3. The manner of it: with vehemency, and yet with faith. There was
   faith in it, for he saith, My God. The vehemency is seen in the
   extension of his voice: he cried with a loud voice; and by the
   ingemination of the name of God: my God, my God.

   1. The circumstance of time: about the ninth hour. We read in the
   former verse, that from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the
   earth until the ninth hour.' At the passion of Christ the earth
   trembled, the sun seemed to be struck blind with astonishment, and the
   frame of nature to put itself into a funeral garb and habit, as if the
   creatures durst not show their glory while God was manifesting his
   anger for sin, and Christ was suffering. After three hours' darkness,
   he complaineth not of that, but of the sad eclipse that was upon his
   own spirit.

   2. The matter complained of: why hast thou forsaken me? It is not an
   expostulation, so much as a representation of the heavy burden that was
   upon him. Questions among the Hebrews imply earnest assertions; as Ps.
   x. 1, Why standest thou afar off? Why hidest thou thyself in the time
   of trouble?' that is, Lord! thou hidest thyself from me. So Ps. xliii.
   2, Why go I mourning, because of the oppression of the enemy?' that is,
   I do go mourning. The case is represented in such forms of speech.

   3. The vehemency.

   [1.] In the extension of his voice. Great griefs express themselves by
   strong cries; for burdened nature would fain have vent and utterance.
   And the apostle taketh notice of this circumstance, meta krauges
   ischuras, Heb. v. 7, He offered prayers and tears, with strong crying.'

   [2.] In the ingemination of the name of God: My God, my God. These
   possessive particles are words of faith striving against the
   temptation. He had great trouble of spirit, but to that he opposeth his
   interest: My God, my God. In the bitterest agonies Christ despaired
   not, but still had a most firm persuasion of God's love to him, and
   necessary support from him. But all showeth the trouble was not light,
   but heavy and grievous.

   Doct. That Christ, as suffering for our sins, was really deserted for a
   time, in regard of all sensible consolation.

   I. What was Christ's desertion?

   II. Why it befell him.

   III. What use may we make of it?

   I. What was Christ's desertion? I shall, for more distinctness, handle
   it negatively and affirmatively.

   First, Negatively.

   1. It was not a desertion in appearance or conceit only, but real. We
   often mistake God's dispensations. God may be out of sight, and yet we
   not out of mind. When the dam is abroad for meat, the young brood in
   the nest is not forsaken. The children cry as if the mother were
   totally gone, when she is employed about necessary business for their
   welfare. Sion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, my God hath forgotten
   me.' Isa. xlix. 14, 15. In the misgivings of our hearts God seems to
   have cast off all care and thoughts of us. God's affectionate answer
   showeth that all this was but a fond surmise: Can a woman forget her
   sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her
   womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.' So we think
   that we are cut off when God is about to help and deliver us, Ps. xxxi.
   22. Many times we think he has quite cast us off, when we are never
   more in his heart. Surely, when our affections towards God are seen by
   mourning for his absence, he is not wholly gone; his room is kept warm
   for him till he come again. We mistake God's dispensations when we
   judge that a forsaking which is but an emptying us of all carnal
   dependence: Ps. xciv. 18, 19, When I said, My foot slipped, thy mercy,
   O Lord, held me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy
   comforts delight my soul.' He is near many times when we think him afar
   off; as Christ was to his disciples when their eyes were withheld that
   they knew him not, but thought him yet lying in the grave, Luke xxiv.
   16. But this cannot be imagined of Christ, who could not be mistaken.
   If he complained of a desertion, surely he felt it. It was a real
   desertion. He could not misinterpret the dispensation of God he was now
   under, for such misapprehensions are below the perfection of his
   nature.

   2. Though it were real, the desertion must be understood so as may
   stand with the dignity of his person and offices. Therefore--

   [1.] There was no separation of the Father from the Son; this would
   make a change in the unity of the divine essence: John x. 30, I and my
   Father are one'--Empericho'resis. This eternal union of the person of
   the Father with the person of the Son always remained; for the divine
   nature, though it may be distinguished into Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, yet it cannot be divided.

   [2.] There was no dissolution of the union of the two natures in the
   person of Christ, for the human nature which was once assumed was never
   after dismissed or laid aside; Achori'stos, Christ ever remained
   Immanuel, God with us, or God in our nature. He was the Lord of glory,'
   even then when he was crucified, 1 Cor. ii. 8. It was the Son of God
   that was delivered up for us all; not a mere man suffered for our
   redemption, but God purchased the church with his blood.' Acts xx. 28.
   Death, that dissolved the bond and tie between soul and body, did not
   dissolve the union of the two natures. They resemble it by a man
   drawing a sword, and holding the sword in one hand and the scabbard in
   another; the same person holds both, though separated the one from the
   other.

   3. The love of God to him ceased not. We read, The Father loved the
   Son, and put all things into his hand,' John iii. 35. Now, he was his
   dear Son, or the Son of his love, Col. i. 13; In whom his soul
   delighted.' Isa. xlii. 1; Eph. i. 6, He hath made us accepted in the
   beloved'--primum amabile; He was the brightness of his glory, and the
   express image of his person,' Heb. i. 3. Therefore he could not but
   love him in every state; yea, he never more loved him as mediator then
   when on the cross, that being the most eminent act of his self-denial
   and obedience (Phil, ii. 7), and so a new ground of love: John x. 17,
   Therefore doth nay Father love me, because I lay down my life to take
   it tap again.' The Father was well pleased with the reconciliation of
   lost sinners, he loveth Christ for undertaking and performing it;
   therefore it is unreasonable to imagine that, now he was about the
   highest act of obedience, there was any decrease of his love to him.
   No; his dispensation might be changed, but not his love. As the sun
   shining through a clear glass, or through a red glass, casts a
   different reflection, a bloody, or a bright, but the light is the same.

   4. His personal holiness was not abated or lessened. The Lord Jesus was
   full of grace and truth,' John i. 14. He had the Spirit not by
   measure,' John iii. 34; he had in perfection all divine gifts and
   graces to accomplish him for this office, Col. i. 19; John i. 16, he
   was anointed by the Holy Ghost, and the oil that was poured on him
   never failed. Therefore he was always most holy and pure, one that
   never knew nor did sin. Neither his nature nor his office could permit
   an abatement of holiness: Heb. vii. 26, Such an high priest became us
   as was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.' The Son of
   God might fall into misery, which is a natural evil, and so become the
   object of pity, not of blame; but not into sin, which is a moral evil,
   a blot, and a blemish. When he died, He died, the just for the unjust,'
   1 Peter iii. 18. The death of Christ had profited us nothing if he had
   been a sinner for a moment; therefore this desertion was not a
   diminishing of his holiness, but a suspension of his comfort.

   5. God's assistance and sustaining grace was not wholly withdrawn, for
   the Lord saith of him, Isa. xlii. 1, This is my elect servant, whom I
   uphold.' And everywhere the Lord is said to be with him in this work:
   Ps. cxxi. 5, The Lord is at thy right hand;' and Ps. xvi. 8, I have set
   the Lord always before me: he is at my right hand, I shall not be
   moved.' Which passage is by Peter applied to Christ: Acts ii. 25, For
   David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my
   face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.' The
   power, presence, and providence of God was ever with him, to sustain
   him in his difficult enterprise. When his agonies began he told his
   disciples, John xvi. 32, Ye shall leave me alone: yet I am not alone,
   but the Father is with me.' The Father was with him when his disciples
   forsook him, and fled every one to his own, to carry him through, and
   that his arm might work salvation for him, and that he might not sink
   under the burden.

   Secondly, Positively.

   1. God's desertion of us, or any creature, may be understood with a
   respect to his communicating himself to us. We have a twofold
   apprehension of God, as a holy and happy being; and when he doth
   communicate himself to any reasonable creature, it is either in a way
   of holiness or in a way of happiness. He doth now in the kingdom of
   grace communicate himself more in a way of holiness, but in the kingdom
   of glory fully in a way of happiness, both as to the body and the soul.
   These two have such a respect to one another, that he never gives
   felicity and glory without holiness, Heb. xii. 14. And a holy creature
   can never be utterly and finally miserable. He may some times give
   holiness without happiness, as when for a while he leaveth the
   sanctified, whom he will try and exercise under the cross, or in a
   state of sorrow and affliction; therefore holiness is the more
   necessary. In his internal government God doth all by his Spirit; now
   the Spirit is more necessarily a sanctifier than a comforter. It was by
   the Spirit that Christ was with God, and God with Christ; therefore his
   desertion of Christ, or any creature, must be mainly understood with
   respect to the Spirit working in any, either as to holiness or comfort.
   When God withdraweth either holiness or happiness, one of them, or
   both, or any degree of them, from any creature, he is said to desert
   them. Now apply this to Christ. It is blasphemy to say that Christ lost
   any degree of his holiness, for he was always pure and holy, and that
   most exactly and perfectly; therefore he was deserted only as to his
   felicity, and that but for a short time.

   2. The felicity of Christ may be considered, either as to his outward
   and bodily estate, or else to his inward man, or the estate of his
   soul.

   [1.] Some say his desertion was nothing else but his being left to the
   will and power of his enemies to crucify him, and that he was then
   deserted when his divine nature suspended the exercise of its
   omnipotency so far as to deliver up his body to a reproachful death, so
   to make way for this oblation and sacrifice for the redemption of
   mankind. God could many ways have protected Christ, and hindered his
   passion: Mat. xxvi. 52, 53, Thinkest thou that I cannot pray to my
   Father, and he shall give me more than twelve legions of angels? But
   how then could the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?' If
   the Lord had seen it fit to glorify himself by the deliverance, rather
   than the sufferings of Christ, he could have found ways and means
   enough to save him; but how then could our redemption be accomplished?
   Christ himself by his divine power could have protected his bodily
   life, for he telleth us: John x. 18, No man taketh my life from me, but
   I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
   to take it up again.' But it pleased God to appoint, and Christ to
   submit to another course, and therefore was he so far deserted, and
   left in the hand of his enemies. He telleth them, Luke xxii. 53, This
   is your hour, and the power of darkness.' This, some say, was all
   Christ's desertion; and that he cried out with a loud voice, in the
   hearing of all, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' to give
   notice of the price that was to be paid for our ransom. He complained
   not of the Jews that had accused him, nor of Pilate that condemned him,
   nor of Judas that had betrayed him; but of God that had forsaken him,
   and left him in the hands of his enemies, as if this were the most
   grievous thing to the Son of God. But certainly this was not all; the
   desertion was not only in his outward estate, and with respect to
   bodily death, for these reasons:--

   (1.) Why should Christ complain of that so bitterly, which he did so
   readily and willingly undergo, and might so easily have prevented, and
   which was most obvious, and so clearly foreseen in his sufferings? He
   foretold it again and again to his disciples, and spake it to his
   enemies; and should he now represent it as a strange thing? Surely
   these strong cries were not extorted from him by the mere fear and
   horror of bodily death. I confess he died not insensibly, but showed
   the reality of all human passions; yet there was no reason why he
   should so bitterly and lamentably complain, if nothing else but bodily
   death had been in the case, and that brought upon him by his enemies.

   (2.) If we look merely to bodily pains and sufferings, certainly others
   have endured as much if not more, as the thieves that were crucified
   with him lived longer in their torments, and the good thief did not
   complain that he was forsaken of God. Peter was crucified, and that
   with his head downwards, as ecclesiastical history tells us, which, as
   it was greater cruelty in the adversaries, so also greater pain to him;
   and yet he trusted that God would sustain him and support him under it.
   Therefore, certainly, there was something greater and more grievous to
   the soul of Christ than these bodily pains, which drew this lamentable
   and loud cry from him.

   (3.) It would follow that every holy man that is persecuted and left to
   the will of his enemies, might be said to be forsaken of God, which is
   contrary to Paul's holy boasting: 2 Cor. iv. 9, Persecuted, but not
   forsaken.' Therefore there was something more than to be left to the
   will of his enemies.

   (4.) This desertion was a punishment, one part or degree of the
   abasement of the Son of God, and so belongeth to the whole nature that
   was to be abased, not only to his body but his soul. We read often of
   his soul-sufferings: Isa. liii. 10, He was to make his soul an offering
   for sin,' and to see the travail of his soul,' ver. 11. His soul was
   deprived of consolation, and some effects of the Spirit as to joy and
   comfort.

   [2.] As to the felicity of his inward estate, the state of his soul.
   Christ carried about his heaven with him, and never wanted sensible
   consolation, spiritual suavity, the comfortable effects of the divine
   presence, till now they were withdrawn, that he might be capable of
   suffering the whole punishment of sins, and feel not only pains and
   torments of body, but troubles of soul, such as we have when God hideth
   his face from us, but without sin. The divinity kept back those
   irradiations of heavenly light and comfort, or, for a while, suspended
   that joy and comfort which otherwise he felt in himself, though it gave
   out that virtue and strength which was necessary to support and sustain
   him under so great sufferings. As when the sun is eclipsed, the light
   of it ceaseth not, but is only hidden from the earth by the
   interposition of a dark body. So here, Christ had not the participation
   of that heavenly joy which before his soul felt by dwelling with God in
   a personal union, though there were no separation of the human nature
   from the divine; the ground of it was not taken away, but only the
   sense suspended; no dissolution of the union, but a ceasing of the
   comfort of it.

   In short, I will show how this sort of desertion is--

   1. Possible.

   2. Grievous.

   1. Possible, the union between the two natures remaining; for as the
   divine nature gave up the body to death, so the soul to desertion.
   Christ, as God, is the fountain of life,' Ps. xxxvi. 9, and yet Christ
   could die. So the Godhead is the fountain of all joy and comfort, for
   he is called the God of all comfort,' 2 Cor. i. 3; and yet Christ's
   soul was troubled and heavy unto death, the Godhead suspending its
   virtue and operation. Both might well consist, for though the presence
   of the divinity be necessary with the humanity of Christ, yet the
   effects are voluntary. God worketh not out of necessity, no r not in
   the human nature of Christ; all kind of communications are given out
   according to his own pleasure. The divinity remained united to the
   flesh, and yet the flesh might die; so it remained united to the soul,
   and yet the soul might want comfort. The bond by which the two natures
   were united in one person remained firm and indissoluble, but the
   influx of sweetness and comfort was suspended. Some effect there is of
   the union, but not that which affords comfort and felicity, and this
   was suspended but for a time. There is a desertion, indeed, which
   agreeth not with the dignity of Christ. There is a total and eternal
   desertion, by which God so deserteth a man, both as to grace and glory,
   that he is wholly cast out of God's presence and adjudged to eternal
   torments, which is the case of the reprobate in the last judgment; this
   is not compatible to Christ, nor agreeing with the dignity of his
   person. There is a partial, temporal desertion, when God for a moment
   hideth his face from his people, Isa. liv. 7. This is so far from being
   contrary to the dignity of Christ's nature, that it is necessary to his
   office for many reasons.

   2. That it is very grievous. This was an incomparable loss to Christ,

   [1.] Partly because it was more natural to him to enjoy that comfort
   and solace than it can be to any creature. To put out a candle is no
   great matter, but to have the sun eclipsed, which is the fountain of
   light, that sets the world a-wondering. For poor creatures to lose
   their comforts is no great wonder, who, though they live in God, are so
   many degrees distant from him; but for Christ, who was God-man in one
   person, that is a difficulty to our thoughts, and a wonder in deed, for
   by this means he was so far deprived of some part of himself.

   [2.] Partly because he had more to lose than we have. The greater the
   enjoyment, the greater is the loss or want. It was more for David to be
   driven from his palace, than a poor Israelite to be driven from his
   cottage. We lose drops, he an ocean. A poor Christian that hath some
   heaven upon earth in the fore-enjoyment of God, and the first-fruits
   and earnest of the Spirit, hath more to lose than another that hath had
   only some vanishing taste in the offer of eternal life, and receiving
   the word with joy. Proportionably judge of Christ, who was
   comprehensor, while he was viator, had the beatifical vision whiles on
   earth.

   [3.] Partly because he knew how to value the comfort of the union,
   having a pure understanding and heavenly affections. God's children
   count one day in his presence better than a thousand, Ps. lxxxiv. 10;
   one glimpse of his love more than all the world, Ps. iv. 7. If they
   have anything of the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, they
   would not part with it for all the sensual enjoyments which others
   prize and value so much, and if they lose it they are touched to the
   quick; they lose that which is the life of their lives, which they
   account their chief happiness. Now Christ was best able to apprehend
   the worth and value of communion with God, having such a clear under
   standing and tender affections, and therefore it must needs be grievous
   to him to have his wonted consolations suspended.

   [4.] Partly because he had so near an interest and relation to God:
   Prov. viii. 30, One bred up with him, and daily his delight;' Col. i.
   13--Uio`s aga'pes. Look, among the children of God if they have any
   interest in him, how mournfully do they brook his absence. Mary
   Magdalen, Woman, why weepest thou? They have taken away my Lord, and I
   know not where they have laid him,' John xx. 13. She sought a Christ,
   and found a grave. Christ's words, my God, do not only express his
   confidence but affection, when his God and Father hideth his face from
   him.

   [5.] Partly from the nature of Christ's desertion. It was penal. All
   desertions may be reduced to these three sorts--for trial, for
   correction, or punishment. For trial; so God left Hezekiah, to prove
   what was in his heart,' 2 Chron. xxxii. 31. For fatherly correction; so
   God leaveth his people for a while, to teach them repentance, humility,
   hatred of sin, more entire dependence on himself, Isa. liv. 7, I have
   left thee for a small moment, but with everlasting mercies will I love
   thee.' For punishment; so he left Saul: 1 Sam. xxviii. 6, when he
   answered him neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.' So he
   leaveth the wicked to a reprobate mind. Now Christ's desertion was not
   for a trial. Fallible creatures may be put upon trial, but the Son of
   God needs it not. It would not agree with the goodness and wisdom of
   God to put his beloved Son on such a trial. He was neither unknown to
   his Father, nor did he vainly presume of his own strength as to need to
   be confuted by trial. Nor can it properly be called fatherly
   correction, for there was no sin in Christ that needed to be corrected.
   Indeed, the chastisement of our peace was upon his shoulders.' Isa.
   liii. 5. Therefore it remains that this desertion was penal and
   satisfactory, such as came from the vindictive and revenging hand of
   God. Our sins met in him, and he was forsaken in our stead. There was
   no cause in Christ himself, wherefore he deserved to be forsaken of
   God, but we had done the wrong, and he maketh the amends. There was
   nothing in Christ's person to occasion a desertion, but much in his
   office; so he was to give body for body and soul for soul; and this was
   a part of the satisfaction. He was beloved as a Son, forsaken as our
   mediator and surety.

   II. Why was Christ forsaken?

   Ans. With respect to the office which he had taken upon him, to expiate
   our sins, and to recover us from the deserved wrath and punishment into
   the love and favour of God. This desertion of Christ carrieth a
   suitableness and respect to our sin, our punishment, and our
   blessedness.

   1. Our sin. Christ is forsaken to satisfy and make amends for our
   wilful desertion of God. When Adam sinned, we all turned the back upon
   God who made us. Yea, all actual sins are nothing but a forsaking of
   God for very trifles, an aversion from God, and a conversion to the
   creature: Jer. ii. 13, They have forsaken me, the fountain of living
   waters, and have hewn out unto themselves broken cisterns that will
   hold no water.' Now we that forsook God deserved to be forsaken by God;
   therefore what we had merited by our sin, Christ endured as our
   mediator. He himself submitted to desertion. It is strange to consider
   what small things draw us off from God: For handfuls of barley and
   pieces of bread will that man transgress,' Ezek. xiii. 19; for a pair
   of shoes,' Amos ii. 6; for one morsel of meat,' Heb. xii. 16; Isa. lii.
   3. This is the great degeneracy and disease of mankind, that a trifle
   will prompt us to forsake God, as a little thing will make a stone run
   down hill; it is its natural motion. There is nothing that is so easily
   exposed and put to hazard as the favour of God. Now this being the
   great sin of man, and the cause of other sins, it was needful that the
   odiousness of this sin should be set forth by the bitterness of
   Christ's sorrow under the want of the love of God. Christ's complaints
   show how God's favour is to be valued, and that it is a dangerous thing
   to part with it for carnal satisfactions. The consolations of God are
   cheap, and small things in the eyes of most men in the world. What is
   more slighted than God and Christ and our own salvation, and neglected
   for very trifles? And then what more perfect cure, and better way to
   instruct the world, than that these sins could not be expiated but by
   the desertion of the Son of God, and his bitter complaints for the
   suspension of the effects of the love of God to him?

   2. It carries a full respect to the punishment appointed for sin.
   Certain we are that he bore the curse of the law,' Gal. iii. 13. Now
   the curse of the law, actively taken, is nothing but the sentence of
   the law, or rather of God the judge, condemning the transgressors of it
   to such punishment as the law appointed; passively taken, it is the
   punishment itself. And the final and great curse is that described,
   Mat. xxv. 41. To be banished from the presence of the Lord, and cast
   into extreme torment. There is a double punishment--poena damni et
   sensus, the loss and the pain. The loss consisteth in our separation
   from God, from the comfortable happy fruition of him in glory: depart,
   ye cursed.' The pain in eternal torments is set forth by the worm and
   by the fire, Mark ix. 44. Now Christ being our surety, Heb. vii. 22,
   and giving himself a ransom for all,' 1 Tim. ii. 6--anti'lutron, the
   word implies a substitution or surrogation of one person in the room of
   another; he was to suffer what we were to suffer; if not the idem,
   every way the same, yet the tantundem, that which was sufficient to
   Christ's ends, that which was to carry a full resemblance with our
   punishment. It is one part of the punishment of sin to be forsaken of
   God, and many say the punishment of loss is greatest; he was therefore
   to suffer so much of it as his holy person was capable of; some thing
   that answereth to the poena damni in his desertion, and to the poena
   sensus in his agonies and pains: Isa. liii. 4, Surely he hath borne our
   griefs, and carried our sorrows.'

   It is true the accidentals of punishment Christ suffered not. As--

   [1.] To the place, he was not in hell. It was not necessary that Christ
   should descend into the hell of the damned. One that is bound as a
   surety for another needs not go into prison provided that he pay the
   debt. All that justice requireth is, that he satisfy the debt. In deed,
   if he doth not, nor cannot satisfy the debt, he must to prison. So here
   the justice of God must be satisfied, the holiness of God and hatred to
   sin sufficiently demonstrated, but Christ need not to go into the place
   of torments.

   [2.] For the time of continuance. The damned must bear the wrath of God
   to all eternity, because they can never satisfy the justice of God,
   therefore they must lie by it world without end. As one that pays a
   thousand pounds by a penny a week, is a long time in paying; a rich man
   lays it down in cumulo, in a heap of gold all at once. Christ hath made
   an infinite satisfaction in a finite time; he bore the wrath of God in
   a few hours, which would overwhelm the creature. Christ did not suffer
   the eternity of wrath, but only the extremity of it, intensivè, not
   extensivè. The eternity of the punishment ariseth from the weakness of
   the creature, who cannot overcome this evil, and get out of it.

   [3.] There is another thing unavoidably attending the pains of the
   second death in reprobates, and that is desperation, an utter
   hopelessness of any good, yea, a certain expectation of continual
   torment, Heb. x. 27. The gates of hell are made fast on them by an
   irresistible decree; and the gulf is fixed between the place of the
   damned, and the place of the blessed, so that there is no coming from
   the one to the other, Luke xvi. 26. Now this despair is not an
   essential part of the law's curse, but only a consequent, occasioned by
   the sinner's view of his remediless and woful condition. But this
   neither did nor could possibly befall the Lord Jesus, who was able by
   his divine power both to suffer and satisfy, to undergo and overcome,
   and therefore expected a good issue in his conflict: Ps. xvi. 9, 10, My
   flesh shall rest in hope; for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor
   suffer thine holy one to see corruption,' was spoken as from Christ,
   Acts ii. 27. A shallow stream would drown a little child, whereas a
   grown man may hope to escape out of a far deeper place, yea, a skilful
   swimmer out of the ocean. Christ passed through that sea of wrath which
   would have drowned all the world, and came safe to shore.

   3. With respect to our blessedness, which is to live with God for ever
   in heaven. Christ was forsaken, that there might be no longer any
   separation between us and God. He was forsaken for a while, that we
   might be received for ever. Our separation from God by sin was the
   meritorious cause, but the final cause was our eternal conjunction with
   God; so that this desertion, which was so bitter to Christ, is the
   cause of sweet consolation to us, as it hath procured for all them that
   obey the gospel that they should be happy for ever in the eternal
   vision and fruition of God. I observe this, because of the constant use
   of the scripture, which expresseth our benefits in a direct opposition
   to Christ's sufferings; as He was made sin for us, that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in him,' 2 Cor. v. 21. He was made a
   curse for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us.' He was
   made of a woman, that we might receive the adoption of sons,' Gal. iv.
   4, 5. He was made poor, that we through his poverty might be made
   rich,' 2 Cor. viii. 9. And by his wounds and stripes we are healed,' 1
   Peter ii. 24. By his death we have life, by his shame we have glory,
   and so, by consequence, by his desertion we obtain communion with God,
   and the everlasting fruition of him. By a wonderful exchange he taketh
   our evil things upon himself, that he might bestow his good things upon
   us, and took from us misery that he might convey to us felicity.

APPLICATION.

   First, by way of information.

   1. How different are they from the spirit of Christ that can brook
   God's absence without any remorse or complaint? Christ cried with a
   loud voice, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' These go on
   securely, never observe God's accesses and recesses; when the comforts
   of his Spirit, and the communications of his grace are wholly suspended
   and withholden from them, they never lay it to heart. Stupid and
   insensible creatures! It is all one to them whether God go or come,
   whether he manifest himself propitious to them or his face be hidden
   from them. They take up with the vain delights of the present world.
   Micah showed more respect to his idols than they do to God: Judges
   xviii. 24, Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more? and do you
   ask, What aileth thee?' When God is gone they are not troubled. The
   Christians wept when Paul said, Ye shall see my face no more,' Acts xx.
   25; and will ye not mourn and lament your loss when God hideth his face
   and shutteth up himself in a veil and cloud of displeasure? Much of
   serious Christianity lies in an observation of God's coming and going,
   and a suitable carriage, Mat. ix. 15. A serious Christian will be
   affected with the loss of comfort and quickening, and lament after a
   withdrawn God.

   2. It informeth us of the grievousness of sin. It is no easy matter to
   reconcile sinners to God; it cost Christ a life of sorrows, and after
   wards a painful and an accursed death, and in that death, loss of
   actual comfort, and an amazing sense of the wrath of God. We make a
   mock of sin--jest and sport away our souls, but Christ found it hard
   work to save them and recover them to God. When you make sin a light
   matter, you slight the sufferings of Christ; oh, therefore, take heed
   you do not break with God for every trifle!

   3. The greatness of our obligation to Christ, who omitted no kind of
   sufferings which might conduce to the expiation of sin. He exchanged
   his heaven for a kind of hell to do you good; the fulness of the
   godhead dwelt in him bodily, and therefore he had a heaven upon earth.
   If one could say, Anima justi coelum est, because heaven is begun there
   in peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost. How was it with
   Christ? This heaven he wanted for a while, felt no comfort, yea, he was
   amazed at the sense of God's wrath due to sinners; therefore it was
   said in the type of him, The pains of hell got hold upon me,' Ps. cxvi.
   3. Oh! let this excite us to love Christ, that you may count nothing
   too dear for him.

   4. The infiniteness of God's mercy, who appointed such a degree of
   Christ's sufferings, as in it he gives us the greatest ground of hopes
   to invite us the more to submit to his terms. There is nothing standeth
   in the way but our own impenitence and unbelief. Now God is so amply
   satisfied, shall we deprive ourselves of eternal blessedness? This is
   the worst cruelty and hatred to our own souls.

SERMON X.

   Whisperers, backbiters.--Rom. I., part of the 29th and 30th verses.

   THE context showeth how corrupt and miserable man's nature is with out
   Christ. His heart was first withdrawn from God, and then became a sink
   of loathsome sins and vices; therefore the apostle telleth us how after
   men were false to God, how little they were true to themselves, whether
   considered singly and apart, or as to commerce and society: singly and
   apart, defiling themselves with uncleanness of all sorts; as to
   commerce and human society, full of malice and contention, which
   sometimes goeth as far as blood; at other times showeth itself in
   falseness and baseness of disposition, generally in self-love and
   detraction from others.

   Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest. When God leaveth
   mankind to its own degeneracy and corruption, and one great branch of
   this corruption is detraction, which venteth itself either by
   whispering or backbiting. So it is in the text, Whisperers, back
   biters.' These two words agree that they both wound the fame of our
   neighbour, and they both do it behind his back or in his absence. But
   they differ--(1.) In that whispering doth it secretly and closely, but
   backbiting openly--the one being privy, the other open defamation, and
   are like theft and rapine; what theft and robbing are to our goods, the
   same are whispering and backbiting to our good names. (2.) Whispering
   tendeth to breed strife among our friends, or to disgrace us to some
   who are well conceited of us; but backbiting to our general disgrace
   before all the world, or amongst whomsoever. The one seeketh to deprive
   us of the goodwill of our friends, the other to destroy our service.
   But however they agree and differ, they are often conjoined in
   scripture: 2 Cor. xii. 20, I fear lest when I come among you I shall
   not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such
   as ye would not; lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
   backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults.' The apostle foresaw it
   as too probable that neither of them would be much pleased with their
   meeting together: nor he with the Corinthians, when he should find them
   corrupted with partialities and divisions; nor the Corinthians with
   him, when he should be forced to inflict censures upon them for their
   factions and emulations, too much bewrayed by their backbitings and
   whisperings against each other. So here in the text they are conjoined,
   whisperers, backbiters,' when the apostle speaketh of the reigning sins
   among the Gentiles.

   Doct. One great sin wherein the corruption of human nature bewrayeth
   itself is detraction, or depriving others of a good repute.

   Here I shall show:--

   I. What is detraction.

   II. The heinousness of the sin.

   I. What it is. (1.) The nature of it. (2.) The kinds of it.

   First, The nature of it in general. It is an unjust violation of
   another's fame, reputation, or that good report which is due to him.
   God, that hath bidden me to love my neighbour as myself, doth therein
   bid me to be tender not only of his person and goods, but of his good
   name. And indeed one precept is a guard and fence to another. I cannot
   be tender of his person and goods unless I be tender of his fame. For
   every man liveth by his credit: and therefore certainly this is--(1.) A
   sin against God; (2.) A wrong to men; (3.) It proceedeth from evil
   causes.

   1. It is a sin against God, who hath forbidden us to bear false witness
   against our neighbour, and to speak evil of others without a cause:
   Eph. iv. 31, Let all evil-speaking be far from you;' by evil-speaking
   is meant there disgraceful and contumelious speeches, whereby we seek
   to stain the reputation of others.

   2. It is a wrong to man, because it robbeth him of his good name, which
   is so deservedly esteemed by all that would do anything for God in the
   world: Prov. xxii. 1, A good name is rather to be chosen than great
   riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.' The meaning is
   in order to service, and as it more nearly respects both life and
   livelihood. So Eccles. vii. 1, A good name is better than precious
   ointment.' Their ointments were reckoned by those Oriental people
   amongst their most precious riches and treasures, yet a good name is
   preferred before them; which inferreth this conclusion, that the man
   himself should prize it so: for he that is lavish of his fame is not
   usually over-tender of his conscience. Therefore, as he himself should
   not prostitute his good name, so others should not blast it and blemish
   it; for it is a greater sin than to steal the best goods which he hath,
   and it is such an evil as scarce admits any sound restitution; for the
   imputation even of unjust crimes leaveth a scar though the wound be
   healed.

   3. The causes it proceedeth from. They are these:--

   [1.] Malice and ill-will, which prompteth us to speak falsely of
   others, so to make them odious, or do them wrong or hurt. Now, to hate
   our brother in our heart is no way consistent with that goodness and
   charity which the impression of the love of Christ should beget in us.
   The apostle saith, 1 Peter iv. 8, Above all things have fervent charity
   among yourselves, for charity shall cover a multitude of sins.' If
   nothing but love and fervent love will restrain us, surely where hatred
   is allowed, men care not w r hat they think, or speak, or do against
   others. Now, as there is a brotherly love due to our fellow-saints, so
   there is a love due to all men. 2 Peter i. 7, I am to hate no man, but
   to seek their good. There is a twofold hatred--the hatred of offence
   and abomination, and the hatred of enmity. The hatred of offence, which
   is opposite to the love of complacency, may be justified as to the
   wicked: Prov. xxix. 27, An unjust man is an abomination to the just,
   and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.' But
   then we should first and most abominate ourselves for sin; this very
   hatred and abhorrence should begin at home, and we should be most
   odious to ourselves for sin, for we know more sin by ourselves than we
   can do by another. But for the other hatred, the hatred of enmity,
   which is opposite to the love of benevolence, that should be quite
   banished out of the heart of a Christian. And it is not enough for
   God's people to keep themselves free from hatred and malice against one
   another, but against all men: Titus iii. 2, Put them in mind to speak
   evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to
   all men: for we ourselves were sometimes disobedient,' &c. If this old
   hatred were gone, a multitude of offences would be covered.

   [2.] It comes from uncharitable credulity, whereby men easily believe a
   false report, and so propagate and convey it to others: Jer. xx. 10, I
   have heard the defaming of many; Report, say they, and we will report
   it. All my familiars watched for my halting,' &c. The prophet
   complaineth--Many, and those no mean ones, have I heard reproaching and
   taunting me, so that he was a terror to himself and to all his friends.
   Many had combined by false suggestions and malicious informations
   against him to work his ruin. If any will raise a report tending to the
   discredit of another, some will foster it, and it loseth nothing in the
   carriage, till by additions and misconstructions it groweth to a
   downright and dangerous infamy.

   [3.] It comes through rashness and unruliness of tongue: some men never
   learned to bridle their tongues, and the apostle James telleth us that
   therefore their religion is vain,' James i. 26. Till we make conscience
   of these evils, as well as others, we content ourselves with a partial
   obedience, and therefore cannot be sincere. But many never set
   themselves to learn this part of their duty, and therefore divulge a
   report before they try it, or receive any just proof of it. Possibly it
   may not come from downright malice, but their tongues hang too loose,
   without the coercion and just restraint of grace, and so they either
   report false things, or speak truth to an evil end: Prov. xi. 13, A
   tale-bearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit
   concealeth the matter.' Whisperers must be talking, and be it true or
   false, out it comes. Certainly it is a sin as long as you knew it not
   to be true, or, if you do, when you have no warrantable call to mention
   it. To reveal secrets which you may conceal without wrong to God, or
   your own consciences, or the common good, or the good of your
   neighbour, is loquacity, or the sin of idle and impertinent
   talkativeness, the disease of a whisperer and tale-bearer.

   [4.] It comes from carnal zeal, which is nothing else but passion for
   our different interests and opinions. The bitter envying which the
   apostle speaketh of, James iii. 14, hath made mad work in the world as
   to strifes, and confusions, and quarrels, and bloodsheds, and
   persecutions. But usually it venteth itself in evil-speaking; for the
   apostle maketh backbitings and whisperings' the fruits of swellings and
   tumults,' 2 Cor. xii. 20. Oh, what false and lying tales are there
   carried to and fro, that a man knoweth not what or whom to believe! So
   many lies walk under the disguise of religion, that not to credit them,
   or countenance the report, seemeth a decay of affection, but surely not
   to religion, but only the interest of a faction.

   But a question ariseth, Is all speaking evil of another unlawful?

   Ans. I cannot say so, but yet it is hard to keep it from sin.

   1. He that doth it without just cause is plainly a detractor, and so a
   grievous sinner before God. You may impose and impute false crimes upon
   others, which is properly called slander, and God thereby convinceth
   the professor of the true religion to be a hypocrite: Ps. l. 20, Thou
   sittest and speakest against thy brother, and slanderest thy own
   mother's son,' God doth not only reject the liars for hypocrites, but
   also the backbiters and slanderers. Those that allow themselves in the
   frequent practice of this sin, what hopes can they have of acceptance
   with God, since he hath entered his plea against them? For the act to
   be sure is sinful; there can be no other end in it but the wronging of
   our brother's fame and reputation, to his loss and hurt. The nature of
   the thing showeth it.

   2. He that doth but speak what he hath heard from others, with out any
   assertion or asseveration of his own, as not knowing the truth of the
   report, can hardly be excused from sin. For if without just cause he
   speaketh those things that may wound the reputation of others, he is in
   part accessory: for he reporteth those things which may induce the
   hearers to think ill of another, or at least beget a suspicion in their
   minds concerning him, and so is a concurring cause to wrong another's
   name and good report. Now we should be so jealous of sin, that we
   should not countenance it in others without a just and weighty cause.

   3. He that doth speak that which is true, but tendeth to the infamy of
   another, may be guilty of sin, if he have not a sufficient call and
   warrant. As for instance--(1.) If it be a matter we have nothing to do
   with, but only speak of their faults for talk sake; this is to be
   busy-bodies and tattlers,' 1 Tim. v. 13: as we all love to speak of
   other men's faults, when we look little at home. This is a sin, when it
   is not matter of our cognisance. Or (2.) If we aggravate things beyond
   their just size and proportion; for then we do not exercise Christian
   lenity and meekness towards those that are fallen, Gal. vi. 1. Or (3.)
   If we urge their crimes, and deny their graces; this is like flies to
   pitch on the sore place. Is there no good amongst all this evil? But it
   may be done, when crimes are public, and men themselves have forfeited
   all good repute, and God doth as it were hang them up in chains for a
   warning to the rest of the world; or when their reputation may injure
   the truth, and seduce the souls of others, or be an injury to the just
   who are slandered by them. In short, when the glory of God, or love to
   the public good, or the avoiding some great danger that may befall
   others by their esteem, then a lesser good is to be neglected to
   procure a greater, and a growing evil prevented, when men, by
   dissembling their wickedness, seek a fame to the manifest hurt of
   others' souls.

   Secondly, The kinds of it are two in the text whispering and
   backbiting.

   1. Whispering, which is privy defamation of our brother, to bring him
   into disfavour and disrespect with those that formerly had a better
   opinion of him. Herein whispering differeth from backbiting, because
   the whisperer stingeth secretly, but the other doth more openly attack
   our credit. Now this whispering is a great sin:--

   [1.] Because it is here reckoned among the sins which reigned among the
   heathen, and God hath expressly forbidden to his people: Lev. xix. 16,
   Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people.' You
   see tale-bearing and crimination is expressly against God's word; and
   if your hearts stand in awe of the word of God, how dare you indulge it
   and allow it in yourselves? It is observed that the Hebrew word rokel
   properly signifieth a merchant or a trafficker up and down with spices
   and other things; whereupon rakil, the word there used, is a
   tale-bearer, that accuser that makes merchandise of words, and like a
   pedlar goeth from place to place to open his pack, and utter his wares,
   to hear and spread abroad criminations of other men. This is made the
   property of very wicked men: Jer. xi. 4, Every neighbour will walk with
   slanders.'

   2. It is against natural equity, because they do that to others which
   they would not have done to themselves, Mat. vii. 2; and therefore
   storm and take great offence when God, by a righteous providence,
   permitteth others to retaliate with them, and pay them home in their
   own coin, as usually he doth; for they who are not tender of the credit
   and reputation of others, their names are cast out of God's protection,
   and permitted to the strife of tongues.

   3. They are a cause of much mischief in the world, as--

   [1.] Grief to the party wronged: Prov. xviii. 8, The words of a
   tale-bearer'--we read in the margin of a whisperer'--are as wounds, and
   they go down into the innermost parts of the belly;' that is, they
   equally hurt as a sharp sword that is thrust into us, and causes pain
   and anguish. By the chambers of the belly,' is understood the heart.
   Now whether the heart of the hearer, or the heart of the party injured?
   Why not both? The hearer; the words pierce into his heart, and breed
   hatred, or at least suspicion of his friend. The party injured; when he
   comes to the knowledge of it, they breed his grief and vexation.

   [2.] They are a cause of much debate and strife: Prov. xxvi. 20, Where
   no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no tale-bearer
   (or whisperer) strife ceaseth.' Where strife is compared to fire, and
   the whisperer's informations or criminations, to the wood or matter
   that feedeth the fire; the extinction, or putting out of the fire, to
   the ceasing of strife and contention, which is caused by the absence of
   the whisperer; that is, when he is not admitted by either party: Prov.
   xvi. 28, A froward man soweth strife, and a whisperer separateth choice
   friends.' Husband and wife, parents and children, masters and servants,
   princes and subjects, intimate friends. Now He that soweth discord
   between friends or brethren is an abomination to the Lord,' Prov. vi.
   19. Therefore, how can one that feareth God, allow himself in speaking
   evil privily against his neighbour?

   [3.] There is a greater mischief than this, and that is, it many times
   tendeth to the destruction of another's life: Ezek. xxii. 9, In thee
   are men that carry tales to shed blood.' Usually the vapours of slander
   descend in the showers of persecution; and the devil was first a liar,
   and then a murderer. By whispers men are stirred up to hate others, and
   then pursue them with all manner of hostility and displeasures. As Doeg
   the Edomite first accused, and then, by the command of Saul, slew
   Abimelech the high priest, and all his family, destroying the whole
   city of the priests called Nob, as you may see 1 Sam. xxii. 9. David,
   when he professeth the uprightness of his government, would allow no
   such in his court, but would severely punish them: Ps. ci. 5, Whoso
   privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off.' These ways of
   whispering and detraction, by which men are wont to gain confidence,
   favour, and employment from princes, should not only miss of their aims
   with him, but be severely punished when he met with them.

   But here ariseth a question, whether all private complaints and in
   formations against others come under the name of whispering?

   I answer--No, with these cautions:--

   1. If the party be duly admonished; for before we go any further, the
   rule is, Mat. xviii. 15, First tell him his fault between him and thee
   alone.' Private admonition must always precede crimination to others;
   therefore if you forbear privately to admonish the offender in love,
   and seek not to reclaim him from his sinful course, you cannot be
   excused from sin.

   2. If it be made to such as have power to redress the fault, by the
   most discreet and gentle means, before it break out any further. So it
   is said, Gen. xxxvii. 2, Joseph brought unto his father their evil
   report;' that is, their infamous carriage, which caused evil report of
   them; which is set down, not to note his ill-will, but his good
   affection and godliness.

   3. If the complainer seeketh nothing but the amendment of the party;
   otherwise, to vent and divulge the fault, to make the party less
   respected, or to his hurt, is not love, but closer malice; for true
   zeal is not for destruction, but for edification.

   4. If he grieve that he hath cause to complain, and pray for his
   conversion; for then it is more likely that all is done in love. Many
   times the grief is personated, and when whisperers have a mind to wound
   to the quick, they will say, I am sorry to hear such a thing, loth to
   speak of it. But this is like the archer that draweth back his hand
   that the arrow may fly with the more force. But when we pray to God,
   there is the greater presumption of sincerity, because we explicitly
   make him a party, and do what we do as in his sight and presence.

   Secondly, Backbiting is a more public speaking evil of our absent
   brother, to the impairing of his credit. Now, this may be done two
   ways:--

   1. With respect to the good things found in him.

   2. With respect to the evil supposed to be committed by him.

   1. With respect to the good things found in him. There are four degrees
   in this:--

   [1.] The first and highest is, when we deny those good things which we
   know to be in another. This is not only to wrong our neighbour, but to
   rob God of his own praise; for he expecteth to be glorified for all
   those gifts and graces which he hath scattered among the sons of men,
   not only actively by persons themselves, but objectively by the
   beholders. As for instance, if God hath made any a new creature, he is
   to be to the praise of his glorious grace,' not only actively, but
   objectively, Eph. i. 12; though the man in whom this work was wrought
   be silent, yet the work should speak for itself, that is, give occasion
   to beholders to praise God. Now to deny this work, is not only to wrong
   the party, but wrong God. Thus Job's friends counted him a hypocrite,
   when upright; and the people of God are often traduced as dissemblers,
   when yet true,' 2 Cor. vi. 8. Jesus Christ himself was counted a
   wine-bibber, because of his free and social course of life; for he
   affected not a monkish austerity. This is the highest degree, when men
   plainly deny those gifts and graces which are conspicuous in others.

   [2.] When they do not deny, but lessen, the gifts and graces of others.
   To extenuate and clip another's due praise is envy, but in honour to
   prefer them above ourselves is charity and humility: Phil, ii. 3, In
   lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.' Humility
   is content to sit in the lowest place: Rom. xii. 10, In honour
   preferring one another.' Some say this is not to be understood of that
   opinion we have of others, but the respect we put upon them. We are to
   honour others, non sententia mentis, sed actionibus et officiis; that
   is meant of offices of love and outward respect, but not of the
   sentiments of the mind. Certainly it is just that we should contemn no
   man, but give every one all agreeable honour and respect. But that a
   rich man should judge a poor man to be in place and estate before him;
   a learned man, an ignorant man more knowing; a godly man, a wicked more
   holy, is impossible and sometimes inconvenient. Therefore they
   understand it of condescending to mutual offices of love and respect,
   or, rather detracting from ourselves than others. But though this
   exposition might fit the latter place, yet not the former. Esteeming
   others better than ourselves,' must relate to the opinions and
   sentiments of our minds: therefore the meaning is, We should carry all
   things with that quietness and humility as if every one had a better
   opinion of others' wisdom and godliness than his own. And this is
   reasonable enough for every one that is acquainted with himself.
   Humility will teach him to think meanly of himself or any thing that is
   his; and his charity will prompt him to give others all that possibly
   can belong to them, without any retrenchment or defalcation.

   [3.] When we own the good done by them, but deprave it by supposing a
   sinister intention. Thus Satan could not deny but that Job served God,
   but (Job i. 9) Doth Job serve God for nought?' It is usual to count the
   servants of God hypocrites and self-seekers, and accordingly to
   persecute them. If one be poor, it is discontent, melancholy, or some
   fleshly ends set him on work. If mean and simple, it is their folly and
   ignorance makes them so scrupulous and precise. If ministers be zealous
   for God, they must do something for their calling; if great men, they
   only mind their own interest and advantage. Where the action is fair,
   we are not competent judges of the intention of the heart.

   [4.] When neither denying, nor lessening, nor depraving, but when we
   have just occasion to speak of a man's due commendation, we enviously
   suppress it. Envy is a natural sin: James iv. 5, The spirit that
   dwelleth in us lusteth to envy.' And it bewrayeth itself by a dislike
   of other men's just praise. This is a sin of omission at least;
   therefore it is said, 1 Cor. xiii. 4, Charity envieth not.' Nothing is
   more contrary to the goodness commended to us in the gospel than such a
   spirit, which cannot bear the good of another whether seen or spoken
   of. Thus Joseph's virtue was an eyesore to his brethren, therefore they
   endeavoured his destruction. Charity rejoiceth in the gifts and graces
   of others as in our own; but where this hath no place, their praises
   are our disgrace. And few there be that can say with John the Baptist,
   He must increase, but I must decrease,' John iii. 30; that is, in
   splendour and fame, and so confirmed the testimony given to Christ.

   2. As to evil supposed to be committed by them.

   [1.] When we publish their secret slips, which in charity we ought to
   conceal: Prov. xi. 13, A tale-bearer revealeth secrets.' Certain things
   should have a veil drawn over them, and not be manifested without
   sufficient cause. But when a man intrudeth himself into the mention of
   things faulty, which he might with better manners and more honesty
   conceal, it is the effect of a base heart.

   [2.] When, in relating any evil action of another, we use harder terms
   than the quality of the fact requireth, and make evils worse than they
   are, beams of motes, and mountains of mole-hills. We should lessen sins
   all that we can; I mean, the sins and faults of others: Acts iii. 17,
   And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also
   your rulers,' Certainly we should not aggravate things to the height,
   nor from a simple act determine the state of the person, nor from the
   failings of a single person conclude the whole party.

   [3.] By imposing false crimes: Prov. x. 18, He that uttereth a slander
   is a fool;' that is, a wicked person. As Mephibosheth said of Ziba, 2
   Sam. xix. 27, He hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king.' The
   most godly and innocent persons cannot escape the scourge of the
   tongue, and unjust calumnies.

   II. The heinousness of the sin.

   1. In general, that is evident from what is said already. I shall urge
   two arguments more.

   [1.] That men shall be called to an account for these sins as well as
   others; they are not passed by in the judgment: Jude 15, God will
   execute judgment upon all ungodly sinners,' not only for their ungodly
   deeds, but for all their hard speeches.' Now, if injurious and
   contumelious language come into the judgment, how should all beware of
   the least accession to this guilt? So 1 Peter iv. 4, 5, They speak evil
   of you, who shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the
   quick and the dead.' The mockers as well as persecutors were to give a
   strict and sad account. It is no slight and light sin to divulge and
   spread false calumnies to hurt the credit of our brethren. God takes
   notice of a thought in our heart against them, a word in our mouths,
   and will exact a strict account thereof.

   [2.] It is the property of a citizen of Zion, one that shall be not
   only accepted with God now, but dwell with God for ever, not to be
   given to backbiting: Ps. xv. 3, He that backbiteth not with his tongue,
   nor doeth evil to his neighbour;' that is, that makes strict conscience
   of backbiting or calumniating, and abstaineth from doing any kind of
   wrong or reproach to his neighbour.

   2. More particularly, it is the more heinous:--

   [1.] Partly from the person against whom it is committed. As suppose
   the godly and irreprovable for the main, who by their life and
   conversation have the best right to honour and esteem; to do it against
   them is most unjust: Ps. lxiv. 3, They whet their tongues as a sword;
   they shoot their arrows, even bitter words, that they may shoot in
   secret at the perfect; suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not;'
   that is, their slanders and calumnies are shot like poisoned darts and
   arrows secretly or clancularly, without any desert or notice of the
   party against whom they are intended; or else against persons publicly
   employed, and in the special service of God, as magistrates: Num. xii.
   8, Were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?' So
   in the ministry: 1 Tim. iii. 7, He must have a good report from them
   without, lest he fall into reproach, and the snare of the devil.'
   Against these it is not only unjust, but noxious and hurtful to God's
   service.

   [2.] From the persons before whom the slander is bi ought, as sup pose
   kings and princes; so that they are deprived not only of private
   friendships, but the favour and countenance of these under whose
   protection they have their life and service. Thus Hainan whispered
   against the Jews, Esth. iii. 8, It is not for the king's profit to
   suffer them to live;' Doeg against the priests, Ps. lii. 1, Why
   boastest thou in mischief, O mighty man? The goodness of God continueth
   for ever.' It is a strange matter of pleasure and joy to some persons
   in power to be able to mischief those that deserve it least. God is
   eminently great and good. This sort of pride is diametrically opposite
   to his nature. Alas! to trouble a few persons, how irrational is it!
   But such are our depraved natures. Some are never pleased with those
   things that alone yield durable pleasure; but to be able with their
   counsel, as with one poisonous vapour, to blast a multitude of innocent
   persons.

   [3.] From the end of it. If it be done with a direct intention of
   hurting another's fame, it is worse than if out of a rash levity and
   loquacity. Some men have no direct intention of mischief, but are given
   to tattling. It is a great sin in them, and an unprofitable mispense of
   time; but it is a greater in those that make it their business to
   disgrace others or sow discord. These are the bane of human society.

   [4.] From the effect or great hurt that followeth, be it loss of
   estate, as in the case of Mephibosheth, or a general trouble and
   persecution on the people of God. When their good names are buried
   their persons cannot long subsist afterward with any degree of service.
   And all this may be the fruit of a deceitful tongue.

   The use is, to show how good-natured Christianity is, and befriendeth
   human societies; it condemneth not only sins against God, but sins
   against our neighbour. It bindeth its professors to the practice of the
   apostle: Acts xxiv. 16, Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a
   conscience void of offence towards God and towards men;' Phil. iv. 8,
   Whatsoever things are honest, just, good, and true; if there be any
   virtue, or any praise, think of these things.' The world hath taken up
   this prejudice, that religion makes us ill-natured. Of itself there is
   nothing more benign; it only condemneth those that are good-natured to
   others but not to God.

   Use 2. Let us not speak evil of others behind their backs, but tell
   them their faults plainly in love and wisdom, nor encourage others in
   this sin: Prov. xxv. 23, As the north wind drives away the rain, so
   doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.' They that receive tales
   and delight to hear other men's faults, encourage others in their sin,
   and are accessory to or partakers of the guilt. It brings an evil habit
   and custom in our own souls. In short, let us keep up a humble sense of
   our own faults, and looking at home, it will not only divert us from
   slandering of others, but make us compassionate towards them, and breed
   comfort in our own souls.

SERMON XI.

   This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust
   of the flesh.--Gal. V. 16.

   IN these words observe--(1.) A duty enforced; (2.) The consequent and
   fruit of it.

   1. The duty is to walk in the Spirit, which is the sum of all Christian
   piety.

   2. The motive is taken from the consequent and fruit of it: and ye
   shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. Let us fix the sense.

   1. For the duty, to walk in the Spirit.' Walking implieth the tenor and
   course of our actions, in all which we should follow the direction and
   inclination of the Spirit. But what is meant by the Spirit? That it may
   be known, both the contrary principles must be explained together.

   [1.] Flesh is sometimes taken for the body: as Eph. v. 29, For no man
   yet ever hated his own flesh;' it is brought as a reason why husbands
   ought to love their wives as their own bodies, ver. 28, and spirit is
   taken for the soul, Eccles. xii. 7. But this is not the sense here, for
   every man hath soul and body, not the regenerate only; and a man is not
   only to look after the welfare of the soul, but his body also, it being
   the instrument which it useth in its operations.

   [2.] The spirit is sometimes put for reason, and the flesh for sensual
   appetite: as Eph. iv. 23, And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;'
   and 1 John ii. 16, The lusts of the flesh.' But this will not take in
   the whole sense of this place, for other faculties are corrupted
   besides the sensual appetite, and other faculties must be renewed as
   well as the understanding.

   [3.] There is another acceptation of flesh and spirit; that is, that
   spirit signifieth the uncreated Spirit, who is the author of grace; as
   John iii. 5, Except a man be born again of water and the Spirit.' Where
   spirit is put for the Holy Ghost, who immediately worketh grace in us,
   called therefore the Spirit of sanctification,' as that saving grace
   which is the effect of his work is called the sanctification of the
   Spirit.' And the opposite principle, flesh, signifieth the corrupt
   nature of man, as John iii. 6, That which is born of the flesh is
   flesh;' corrupt, sinful, inclined to earthly things. Now though this
   would bear a good sense to interpret flesh and spirit of the Holy
   Ghost, and concupiscence or natural corruption (for no question he
   concurreth to the mortifying of the old man, till sin be wholly
   expelled, Rom. viii. 23, and still doth quicken and excite the new man
   to action, Gal. iv. 25), yet here the apostle speaks of two inherent
   principles.

   [4.] Therefore by flesh and spirit is meant the old man and the new,
   and so by spirit is meant the renewed part, or the new man of grace in
   the heart: John iii. 6, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit;'
   that is, there is a work of saving grace wrought in our hearts by the
   Spirit of God, which new nature hath its motions and inclinations which
   must be obeyed and followed by us. And by flesh, is meant inbred
   corruption, or the old man, which is corrupt, with his deceivable
   lusts,' Eph. iv. 22. Now, then, you see what it is to walk after the
   Spirit, to direct and order our actions according to the inclinations
   of the new nature.

   2. For the consequent fruit of it: and ye shall not fulfil the lust of
   the flesh.'

   Here two things must be explained:--

   The lust of the flesh.

   Fulfil.

   For the lust of the flesh.' By it is meant the inordinate motions of
   corrupt nature. The flesh doth not consider what is right and good, but
   what is pleasing to the senses, and craveth their satisfaction with
   much importunity and earnestness, to the wrong of God and our own
   souls; especially in youth, when the senses are in vigour, and lust and
   appetite in their strength and fury. And generally, all carnal men are
   governed by the lusts of the flesh, called by the apostle, The wills of
   the flesh and the mind,' Eph. ii. 3. By which the heart is drawn from
   God to things earthly and carnal. Well, then, by the lusts of the flesh
   are meant the motions of inbred corruptions.

   2. Ye shall not fulfil; that is, accomplish and bring into complete
   act, especially with deliberation and consent. Mark, he doth not say
   that the lusting of corrupt nature shall be totally suppressed, but it
   shall not be fulfilled. The best of God's children feel the motions of
   the flesh, but they do not cherish and obey them. The lusts of the
   flesh may be said to be fulfilled two ways--(1.) When the outward act
   is accomplished, or when lust hath conceived and brought forth actual
   sin,' James i. 15. Which may sometimes come to pass in the children of
   God, when they walk not in the Spirit, or obey not the motions and
   directions of the renewed part. This again may be done two ways, either
   upon surprise or deliberation. By way of surprise, Gal. vi. 1, ean kai
   prolemphthe; upon deliberation, when men plot, and make provision to
   fulfil their lusts, contrary to the apostle's advice: Rom. xiii. 14,
   Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.' Thus it
   was with David in his great sin; and this doth mightily aggravate the
   offence, and provoke the Lord against us. (2.) When for a continuance
   we obey the flesh, usually accomplish its motions without let and
   restraint, and with love, pleasure, and full consent of will; this is
   proper to the unregenerate. The flesh doth reign over them as its
   slaves; this is spoken of, Rom. vi. 12, Let not sin reign in your
   mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.' Let it not
   have a power over you as slaves. Well, then, the meaning is, you will
   not abuse your Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh, or give
   up yourselves to do that, or seek that which the flesh lusteth after.

   Doct. The more Christians set themselves to obey the new nature, the
   more is the power of inbred corruption mortified and kept under.

   To understand this point, let me lay down these propositions:--

   I. That there is a diversity of principles in a Christian--flesh and
   spirit.

   1. There is a good principle, called spirit, because the Spirit is the
   author of it: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, A new heart and a new spirit will I put
   into you.' It is called also the divine nature,' 2 Peter i. 4, because
   it is made up of those gracious qualities wherein we resemble God; The
   seed remaining,' 1 John iii. 9, because it is not a transient
   operation, but a permanent habit, disposing and inclining the soul to
   God and heaven; The new man,' Eph. iv. 24, because we have it not by
   nature, but by grace, we are new formed to the image of God. Now the
   use of this principle may be known partly by the manner how it is
   wrought in us, and partly by the uses and ends for which it serveth.

   [1.] For the manner how it is wrought in us by the Spirit, that is set
   forth Heb. viii. 10, I will put my laws in their mind, and write them
   in their hearts.' The directive and imperial power of the soul is
   sanctified and seasoned by grace, the mind enlightened, the heart
   inclined. The mind is enlightened by the knowledge of God's will, and
   the heart inclined that we may delight to do his will; it is suited
   thereunto. Therefore, the new creature doth both serve to direct us,
   and so performeth the office of a guide and leader to the godly in all
   their actions, so far in religion as God's glory is concerned, and also
   to move and excite us to that which is good. For the spirit is willing,
   though the flesh is weak,' Mat. xxvi. 41.

   [2.] By its uses and ends. None of God's gifts are given in vain. The
   new nature is the choicest talent that the sons of men are in trusted
   withal. Therefore, it hath its use and end, which is to fit us for God
   and heaven.

   (1.) It disposeth the soul to a sincere obedience to God, as an
   inherent principle: Eph. vi. 24, It is created after God in
   righteousness and true holiness,' as suiting us to these things. So the
   Spirit is promised to enable us to walk in God's ways: Ezek. xxxvi. 27,
   And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.' It helps us to
   avoid sin: 1 John iii. 9, Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin,
   for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of
   God.' They that give back [19] cannot yield to those sins with which
   others are surprised and captivated.

   (2.) It prepares us for heaven; thither is the tendency of the new
   nature, 2 Peter i. 4; 1 John v. 4, Whatsoever is born of God overcometh
   the world:' it moveth us to mind, love, and seek after heavenly things.
   This grace came from heaven, and there it is perfected.

   2. There is another principle of corrupted nature remaining in us,
   which is sometimes called flesh,' as before; sometimes the old man,'
   Eph. iv. 22; Sin that dwelleth in us,' Rom. vii. 17; The body of sin,'
   Rom. vi. 6; The law of the members warring against the law of the
   mind,' Rom. vii. 23.

   By this principle they are inclined to that which is evil. This
   principle also may be known:--

   [1.] By the manner how it was derived to us.

   [2.] By its tendency and operations.

   [1.] The manner how it was derived to us, from Adam in his apostasy,
   and as fallen from his chief good and last end, John iii. 6. When man
   fell from God, he fell to himself. The temptation was, Ye shall be as
   gods,' Gen. iii. 5. He would set up self as a god. And what was that
   self which man sought to idolise, but himself rather considered as a
   body than as a soul? And, therefore, when God sought to reduce man,
   where lay the difficulty? That text will inform you, Gen. vi. 3, My
   Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he is also flesh;'
   that is, sunk or lost in flesh, altogether wedded to the interests of
   the bodily life.

   [2.] By its tendency and influence it prompts us to do those things
   which are most acceptable to sense, or agreeable to our worldly and
   carnal ends. The flesh operateth several ways, according to men's
   callings, occasions, or constitutions, Isa. liii. 6; 1 John ii. 16. As
   every soil beareth such weeds as are most suitable to the nature and
   quality of the ground, so some are enslaved by this, some by that
   particular sin, yet all of them alike opposite to God. Differences
   there are as to the choice of their way wherein they please the flesh,
   some in a more gross, some in a more cleanly manner, yet they all walk
   in the lust of the flesh, following inbred corruption as their guide,
   or obey it either in a way of worldliness, ambition, or sensuality.
   Some ways are more blameless before the world, because they less
   deserve [20] a worldly interest; some are so prodigiously wicked that
   they cause a horror even in mankind though degenerated. Now, after
   conversion some of our former sins cripple us, and we halt of the old
   maim still; and it is not enough to stop one gap while corruption
   runneth out at many more, but we must make conscience of not fulfilling
   the lusts of the flesh' in any kind. Well, now, I have showed you the
   two principles which are in a Christian, that we may have a sense of
   our imbecility, and that we are but regenerated in part.

   II. I will prove to you that there is a liberty in a Christian of
   walking according to each principle, either the Spirit or the flesh.

   1. That the Christian hath liberty of walking according to the Spirit
   is out of question, for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
   liberty,' 2 Cor. iii. 17. Surely the Spirit of Christ can free us, and
   doth free us, from the bondage of corruption: Rom. viii. 2, The law of
   the Spirit of life in Christ hath freed me from the law of sin and
   death,' otherwise there would be no distinction between nature and
   grace. If we should be still shackled and manacled by our lusts, and be
   as unable to pursue our last end as we were before, if there were no
   inclination to God and heavenly things, what have they gotten by grace?
   and therefore, though we are still weak, yet we have the gift of the
   Spirit to free us from sin. The force and efficacy of the new nature
   appeareth in three things--scire, velle, posse; in knowing our duty,
   and willing, and purposing, and doing our duty, suitable to the three
   faculties of man--his understanding, will, and vital power. So the
   spirit received from Christ, 2 Tim. i. 7, is a spirit of power, love,
   and a sound mind.'

   [1.] For scire. The new nature partly consists in the internal light of
   the mind, by which we understand the things of God revealed in the
   scriptures concerning our duties and privileges, and so the unction' is
   said to teach us all things,' 1 John ii. 20; that is, all things which
   belong to our necessary duty and happiness. God's children in necessary
   things have a good understanding, or, as it is said, Isa. xi. 3, they
   are quick of understanding in the fear of the Lord.' By this it doth
   warn us of our danger, mind us of our duty upon all occasions.

   [2.] For velle, to be willing. The force of the new creature lieth in
   the love of God, for we are never converted to God till he hath our
   hearts, till we love him with all our soul, with all our might and
   strength, and hate what is contrary to him: Ps. xcvii. 10, Ye that love
   the Lord, hate evil.' Now, surely they that love God and hate evil are
   at liberty more than others to serve and please God and avoid sin. Hate
   sin once, and it hath little power over you.

   [3.] For posse, or the active power. The wonder is rather how he can
   sin deliberately, voluntarily, than how he cannot sin, 1 John iii. 9;
   and for doing good, pa7'nta ischu'o, Phil. iv. 13, I can do all
   things.' Eph. ii. 10, A spiritual man is prepared for every good work.'

   The assistant power which accompanieth the new creature in all his
   actions doth certainly give him a great advantage of liberty to know,
   will, and do things pleasing unto God. As he doth first convert us unto
   God, and quicken us when we are dead in trespasses and sins, so after
   conversion, when the principles of a new life are put into us, he still
   helpeth us: and as all creatures depend upon God in esse conservari et
   operari, Acts xvii. 2, so doth the new creature depend on the Spirit;
   he leadeth and guideth all the children of God to their everlasting
   estate, Rom. viii. 14. He assists the will and the vital power, Phil.
   ii. 13; otherwise, we may complain with Paul, Rom. vii. 18, For to will
   is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.'
   There may be a will or an inclination, but it can be brought into no
   effect. He cleareth the mind, which otherwise would be blinded by
   temptations, excites the will, which otherwise would be blunted with
   oppositions, assists the vital power, which else would be obstructed
   and impeded from producing its effects.

   2. That a Christian hath a liberty or power of walking according to the
   flesh. The opposite principle, though it be broken so far that it is
   not in habitual predominancy, yet doth too often prevail over us;
   otherwise it were impossible to sin, or to be unjust, unmerciful,
   unmindful of God and heavenly things, unchaste, intemperate, or
   licentious in our actions; and all the admonitions and exhortations of
   the word, to keep the regenerate from yielding to the enticements of
   the flesh, would be in vain, if they could not possibly yield to them.
   In heaven, indeed, there need no dissuasions from sin, because the
   glorified saints are above all possibility of sinning; there is no
   devil to tempt, nor world to entice, nor flesh to incline them to be
   seduced by those temptations: but earth is not heaven. Here mortified
   lusts may awaken, and recover strength by a temptation. But more
   distinctly these arguments show it:--

   [1.] That though the inclination be to God and heaven, which is the
   fruit of saving grace, yet the acts of it are voluntary. Grace is a
   real, active, working thing, but it doth network necessarily, as fire
   burneth; it must be excited and stirred up, both by the Spirit of God,
   who worketh in us, both to will and to do,' Phil. ii. 13, and by
   ourselves. We must anazopurein, 2 Tim. i. 6. We must still be blowing
   up this holy fire, as the priest did the fire of the altar to keep it
   burning; and its motions must be hearkened to, cherished, and complied
   withal, if we would keep the carnal part under, and prevent it from
   breaking out into shameful acts. But as we grow remiss or careless in
   our duty, sin acquireth and prevaileth over us.

   [2.] The flesh which remaineth in us is importunate to be pleased; and
   though it be not superior in the soul, yet it hath a great deal of
   strength, that still we need, even to the very last, to keep watching
   and striving, and must resolve to be deaf to its entreaties and
   solicitations: 1 Peter i. 14, Not fashioning yourselves to the former
   lusts of your ignorance,' or accommodating yourselves to please the
   flesh; that is, they must not cast their conversations into a carnal
   mould, nor suffer their choice and actions to be directed and governed
   by the influence of the flesh, or give up themselves to the
   satisfaction of their sinful desires. In short, former lusts are but in
   part subdued, our old love to them may be soon kindled, and the bias of
   corruption gather strength again, and the gates of the senses are
   always open to let in such objects as take part with the flesh and stir
   it up. Therefore we must not imagine that there is no need of
   diligence, or striving and watching. Holy Paul saw a need of beating
   down his body; lest, after he bad preached to others, he himself should
   be a castaway,' 1 Cor. ix. 27. After so many years' service in the
   cause of Christ, this great champion was not secure of the adversary he
   carried about with him. There is need of caution to the last, that we
   do not revert into our old slavery. The contrary principle in us still
   retaineth some life and vigour, though much abated; there is not such a
   con-naturality and agreement between the heart and sin as there was
   before; but yet sin still dwelleth and worketh in us, and we are often
   foiled by it.

   3. That since there is a liberty, we must be careful to live according
   to the operation and influence of the better principle; for it lieth
   upon us as our duty, though we have the power from above. There is a
   double argument implied in the text: the one is, a beneficio; the
   other, a periculo--the profit, the danger.

   [1.] A beneficio, from the benefit accruing to us: we shall not fulfil
   the lusts of the flesh.' If they yield to the motions and inclinations
   of the regenerate part, they cannot do the evil which the carnal part
   would have them; the grace they have will hold them in as a bridle, and
   turn their minds another way. Surely sin is no such lovely thing that
   we should be enamoured of it; yea, it is such an hateful thing, that we
   should shun and avoid it by all means possible. Now, when you have an
   help at hand, not only near you, but within you, such as the new
   nature, which riseth up in rebukes and dislikes against sin, you should
   take this advantage, otherwise you offer violence not only to the law
   of God, but that new nature which he hath put into you. There are three
   reasons which may be urged here:--

   (1.) The better principle, the more it is obeyed, the more it is
   strengthened; for the way of the Lord is strength to the upright,'
   Prov. x. 29. The habits of grace increase by exercise: and the more
   godly and heavenly we are, the more we shall be so; and the more
   constantly we act grace, the more easily and readily we act it, and
   with greater pleasure and delight. This is a sure rule, that God
   rewardeth grace with grace: one duty is an help to another, and the
   sweetness and pleasure groweth upon us every day. It is at first yoking
   that the bullock is most unruly; and beginners are burthened with the
   toil of obedience more than grown Christians. Christ's yoke groweth
   more easy every day by the bearing; for the opposition is more broken,
   and the experience of the sweetness and goodness of this way is more
   increased, Prov. iv. 18, 19.

   (2.) The power of inbred corruption is subdued, and the lusts of the
   flesh weakened; for, as the better principle groweth, the other loseth
   strength. Mortification and vivification mutually help one another: the
   more we are dead unto sin, the more we are alive unto righteousness:
   so, on the other side, the more we live unto righteousness, the more we
   are dead to sin; for the carnal life is swallowed up of the spiritual.
   And therefore to grown Christians temptations either make none or no
   considerable impression; they are alive to God, and therefore dead unto
   the flesh and dead unto the world. It cannot be imagined that the flesh
   should bear sway where there is a strong opposite principle to check
   it; and when we suffer it not to be idle and unfruitful, it will obtain
   its effect. Sin cannot be our trade, custom, and delight. No; it is
   complained of as our heaviest burden, Rom. vii. 24, resisted as the
   greatest evil, and most opposite, not only to our duty, but to our very
   nature and temper.

   (3.) This walking in the Spirit giveth us an evidence of our interest
   in the grace of justification: Gal. v. 18, And if ye be led by the
   Spirit, ye are not under the law.' Not to be under the teaching of the
   law as a rule of obedience, is impossible for a creature. To challenge
   such an exemption in point of right, is to make ourselves gods. To
   usurp it in point of fact, is to make ourselves devils. It must be
   meant, therefore, either of the irritating or condemning power of the
   law. If of the former, as the law by the rigid exacting of obedience
   doth increase sin rather than subdue it, and maketh corrupt nature
   spurn and rebel against it, so it is the same with the former motives;
   but that is a more limited sense. Not under the law,' may be expounded
   to be not under the condemning power of it; and so to be under the law
   is opposed to be under grace: Rom. viii. 1, There is no condemnation to
   them that are in Christ Jesus.' There is a great privilege; but what is
   the qualification? Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;'
   that is, obey the new nature.

   [2.] A periculo, the danger of not obeying the new nature, or walking
   after the Spirit.

   (1.) They lose their advantage, and receive one of God's gifts in vain.
   To receive objective grace in vain aggravateth our guilt, John iii. 19;
   but to receive subjective grace in vain doth more provoke God.
   Objective grace is that which is discovered in the gospel; subjective
   grace is that which is found in the heart of a believer, the internal
   grace of the Holy Spirit renewing the heart. Now, to sin away this
   advantage after we are made partakers of it doth increase our guilt;
   surely, therefore, if we live in the Spirit, we should walk in the
   Spirit,' Gal. v. 25. We should improve God's best gifts, or else the
   work of his Spirit is lost. He loseth nothing but corn, wine, and oil
   bestowed upon others, but he hath bestowed the sanctification of the
   Spirit upon you; shall he lose the glory of that also?

   (2.) The new nature is exceedingly weakened and suffers loss, if it be
   not cherished and obeyed. The church of Sardis is warned to prevent the
   dying of gracious habits. David speaketh as if the work were to begin
   anew, and his restoring were a second conversion: Ps. li. 10, Create in
   me a clean heart, O Lord, and renew a right spirit within me.' The
   principle of grace being not adhered to, loseth much of vigour and
   power.

   (3.) When these motions are not obeyed, and this power is not
   exercised, God is provoked to withdraw the quickening grace. Though the
   spirit here spoken of is the new nature, yet the Holy Ghost is the
   superintendent of it, and doth move, guide, direct, and quicken by it.
   The new nature inclineth, but he giveth strength to its motions. Now
   the Spirit withdraweth when this work is slighted, and we wilfully run
   into sin: Ps. li. 11, Take not thy Holy Spirit from me.'

   (4.) There is another mischief; his sanctifying work is not only
   obstructed, but his certifying and sealing work i obscured, and so our
   day is turned into night: Eph. iv. 30, Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
   God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.'

   Use 1. It showeth what necessity there is that we should look after
   conversion to God, or a work of grace wrought in us by the Holy Spirit,
   for the apostle supposeth they had the Spirit. There is no walking
   without living, for otherwise our motions are but the motions of
   puppets, not proceeding from internal life, but acted from springs and
   engines; no subduing the flesh without setting up an opposite
   principle. Therefore, we must give up ourselves to the Holy Spirit,
   first to be sanctified, then governed by him; first renewed, then
   guided, ordered, and directed by him in all our actions, and the flesh
   dieth away insensibly.

   2. Being renewed by the Holy Ghost, that is having our minds
   enlightened and hearts inclined, we must obey this inclination; for
   life is not given us that we may have it, but that we may act by it,
   and do things suitable to that life which we have. Grace is not a
   sluggish, idle quality, but is always working and warring on the
   opposite principle.

   3. Though at first we are pestered and encountered with the lusts of
   the flesh, which divert us from God and heavenly things, yet we should
   not be discouraged by every difficulty; for difficulties do but inflame
   a resolved spirit, as stirring doth the fire. And, besides, though we
   do not wholly subdue the lusts of the flesh, yet we shall not
   accomplish them and live in subjection to them, but by degrees get
   power against them.

   4. The carnal life is not of one sort. Some wallow in sensual
   pleasures, others have head and heart altogether taken up with the
   world and worldly things. Now if God hath put a new bias upon our wills
   and affections, we must show it forth by a heavenly conversation; for
   they that mind earthly things are carnal, and the great inclination of
   the new nature is to carry us unto God and the things of another world,
   2 Cor. v. 5.

   5. They are much to blame that complain of sin, and will not take the
   course to get rid of it by obeying the instincts of the Holy Ghost, or
   the motions of the new nature. The Lord's spirit is a free spirit,' Ps.
   li. 12, and his truth maketh us free,' John viii. 32. And we are
   interested in this liberty when born of the Spirit. Let us be true to
   our duty and we shall bless God for our liberty, rather than complain
   of our bondage. It is laziness and cowardice not to improve grace,
   which was given us for this use.

   6. How much we are concerned in all conflicts, especially in those
   which allow deliberation, to take part with the Spirit, and obey his
   motions rather than to fulfil the lusts of the flesh: otherwise, by
   consent and upon deliberation, you are unfaithful to Christ and your
   own souls. Your business is not to gratify the flesh, but to crucify
   it, to overrule sense and appetite, and cherish the life of grace, Gal.
   v. 24. And surely when conscience hath help to deliberate, it is a
   greater evil to resist it, than when hurried by our own passions.

   7. It is of great use and profit to us to observe which principle
   decayeth, the flesh or the Spirit; for thereby we judge of our
   condition, both in order to mortification and comfort.

   The increase of the flesh may be known:--

   (1.) By your backwardness to God. Grace is clogged when you cannot
   serve him with sweetness and delight, Rom. vii. 18.

   (2.) When the heart groweth careless of heaven, and your life and love
   is more taken up about things present than to come, Phil. iii. 18, 19.
   The contrary is found when grace is in vigour, 2 Cor. iv. 18; Col. iii.
   1, 2.

   Secondly, The prevalency and increase of the Spirit is known:--

   (1.) By a humble contentedness and indifferency to plenty, pleasures,
   and honours: Phil. iv. 12, I know both how to be abased, and I know how
   to abound; everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full
   and to be hungry, both to abound and suffer need;' Heb. xiii. 5, Let
   your conversation be without covetousness, and be ye content with such
   things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor
   forsake thee.'

   (2.) When your delight in God, heaven, and holiness is still kept up:
   Rom. viii. 5, For they that are after the flesh, do mind the things of
   the flesh: but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the
   Spirit.'

   (3.) When the heart is kept in a preparation for the duties of your
   heavenly calling.

SERMON XII.

   For I know that my Redeemer liveth.'--Job XIX. 25.

   THESE words were spoken by Job, a man for the present miserable, and
   suspected by his friends as one that neither feared God nor trusted in
   him. Therefore, to comfort himself in his misery, and to vindicate his
   innocency, he makes confession of his faith.

   In this confession you have the grand and most important articles
   reckoned up.

   1. He doth solemnly declare and believe the promised Messiah to be his
   Saviour: I know that my Redeemer liveth.

   2. His coming to judgment: and that he shall stand at the latter day
   upon the earth.

   3. The resurrection of the dead, with application to himself, for he
   saith, ver. 26, And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet
   in my flesh shall I see God.

   4. And lastly, the beatifical vision, ver. 27, Whom I shall see for
   myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my reins be
   consumed within me.

   We have to do with the first article, his belief of salvation by the
   promised Messiah: For I know that my Redeemer liveth.'

   I am not ignorant that this whole context is carried to another sense,
   not only by the Jewish doctors, but by some Christian interpreters of
   good account, whose reasons, consisting wholly in grammatications, I
   list not now to examine. The common and received sense seemeth better.

   1. Because these words are ushered in with a solemn preface, containing
   in them some notable truth: Oh that my words were now written! Oh that
   they were printed in a book! Oh that they were graven with an iron pen
   and lead in the rock for ever! For I know,' &c. Surely such a
   passionate preface will become no other matter so well as the great
   mystical truths of the Christian faith.

   2. The word (Goel, or kinsman) redeemer, will suit with no person so
   well as Christ.

   3. The rest of the passages do not run smoothly unless they be
   accommodated to this sense, and that I take to be the most obvious
   sense which the words will best bear.

   4. Job, as it is clear by many passages in this book, had often
   disdained all hopes of being restored to any temporal happiness in this
   life, affirming that all his hope was gone, that he was worse than a
   tree cut down. This is the drift and current of all his former
   discourses.

   5. When he saith that he should see God in his flesh, and with the same
   eyes he now had, I cannot imagine why these passages should be so
   emphatically spoken if he only intended in this paragraph a hope of
   being restored to his temporal happiness.

   Having premised this, in the words observe:--

   1. The causal particle, for, giving thereby a reason why he would have
   his words so marked, because of the excellency of the matter.

   2. The article of faith: my Redeemer liveth.

   3. The manner how this article is asserted and professed by Job.

   (1.) With certainty of persuasion: I know. (2.) With application and
   appropriation: my Redeemer; for I know my Redeemer liveth. All put
   together will yield this point:--

   Doct. That it is a great comfort to the saints in all their afflictions
   to know that they have a Redeemer living in heaven.

   This is the first thing whereby Job comforteth himself.

   I. I shall consider the matter of the comfort.

   II. Show you how it is applicable to all afflictions.

   I. The matter of the comfort consists in four things:--

   1. That there is a Redeemer.

   2. That he is their Redeemer.

   3. That he liveth.

   4. That they know this upon certain and infallible grounds.

   1. That there is a Redeemer; for he doth not say, I know that my
   Creator liveth, but my Redeemer.

   The word is Goel. The Septuagint render it o eklu'ein me` me'llon, he
   that will deliver me. Theodotion, better, o`ti o a'nchistos mou ze, my
   near kinsman liveth. The word properly signifies such a one as, in
   regard of propinquity or nearness of kindred, had a right to redeem a
   mortgage, or the like engagement of land or livelihood: Lev. xxv. 25,
   26, If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
   possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, than shall he
   redeem that which his brother sold.' Or else to prosecute the law
   against the murderer of his friend or kinsman, Num. xxxv. 19, 24.

   It is taken sometimes more largely for any deliverer out of thraldom,
   or avenger of wrong in general. And so is in the Old Testament applied
   to God or Christ, to whom the term chiefly belongeth. To God, because
   of his powerful providence and rescuing his people out of their
   calamities: Ps. xxv. 22, Redeem Israel, God, out of all his troubles.'
   To Christ, to whom it is most proper: Isa. lix. 20, And the Redeemer
   shall come to Zion, and to them that shall turn away ungodliness from
   [21] Jacob;' which the apostle applieth to Christ, Rom. xi. 26. He then
   is the Redeemer, and it implieth--(1.) That he is our kinsman after the
   flesh, or by incarnation; (2.) That he paid a price to God for us in
   his passion; (3.) That he pursueth the law against Satan, and rescues
   us by his power; all which are notable grounds of comfort. For under
   the law the redemption of the in heritance, or the person of the poor
   brother sold, was to be made by the next of blood, and that by the male
   side, not by the mother's, but by the father's side, and he also was to
   be the avenger of blood.

   [1.] There is much comfort in this, that Christ is our kinsman, bone of
   our bone, and flesh of our flesh, and therefore certainly will not be
   strange to his own flesh. He did redeem us, not only jure proprietatis,
   by virtue of his interest in us as our Creator, but jure
   propinquitatis, by virtue of his kindred, one of us, of our stock and
   lineage; the Son of Adam, as well as the Son of God. The apostle tells
   us, Heb. ii. 11, For he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified
   are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
   brethren.' As the first-fruits offered to God were taken out of the
   same heap, so he was of the same mass with us. Christ is not only man,
   but the Son of man.' He might have been man if God had created him out
   of nothing, or he had brought his substance from heaven. But he is the
   Son of man, one descended of the loins of Adam, as we are; even thus he
   that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one.' He is of
   the same stock with all mankind, but the kindred is reckoned to the
   sanctified, because there it holdeth of both sides. Christ is born of a
   woman, and they are born of God, and so he is a kinsman doubly--ratione
   incarnationis suae, and regenerationis nostrae; in regard of his own
   incarnation and our regeneration. He partaketh of the human nature, and
   we partake of the divine nature. And it followeth, therefore he is not
   ashamed to call us brethren.' We are said to be ashamed when we do
   anything that is filthy, dishonest, or base, or misbecoming our dignity
   and rank which we sustain in the world. The former consideration is of
   no place here. For the latter, those that bear any port and rank in the
   world are ashamed to show too much familiarity towards their inferiors;
   but such is the love of Jesus Christ towards his people, that though he
   be infinitely greater and more worthy than these, he is not ashamed to
   call us brethren. Well, then, here is the first step of our comfort and
   hope, to see God in our natures. The eternal Son of God became our
   kinsman that he might have the right of redemption, and recover the
   inheritance which we had forfeited. We could not have such familiar and
   confident recourse to an angel, and one who was of another stock and
   different nature from ours, nor put ourselves into his hands with such
   trust and assurance. Now he and we are of one nature, we may be the
   more confident. It is a motive to man: Isa. lviii. 7, Thou shalt not
   hide thyself from thine own flesh.' In Christ all the perfections of
   man were at the highest. This made Laban, though otherwise a churlish
   man, kind to Jacob: Gen. xxix. 14, Surely thou art my bone and my
   flesh.' One of our stock and lineage will pity us more than a stranger.

   [2.] This kinsman was to pay the price and ransom of his captivated
   brother; that also is implied in the notion of a Redeemer: Lev. xxv.
   48, 49, After that he is sold, his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem
   him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family may redeem him.'
   So when we had sold ourselves, Jesus Christ, who only of the kindred
   was free and able to do it, paid a price for us: 1 Cor. vi. 20, We are
   bought with a price.' And this price was no less than his own precious
   blood, 1 Peter i. 18, 19. A price was necessary; for God was not an
   enemy that could be overcome, but must be satisfied, and amends made
   for the wrong done to his majesty, that the notions which are ingrafted
   in man's heart concerning God might be kept inviolate. The Lord knows
   how apt we are to please ourselves with the thoughts of impunity, as if
   it were nothing to sin against God, and a small matter to break his
   laws. Now, to prevent this thought in us, before his justice would let
   go the sinner, he demanded satisfaction, and equivalent satisfaction to
   the wrong done, to expiate the offence done to an infinite majesty.
   Therefore no less could be a sufficient ransom for lost sinners than
   the blood of Christ. This is the price which our kinsman hath paid down
   for us. In short, the wrong was done to an infinite majesty, the favour
   to be purchased was the eternal enjoyment of the ever-blessed life, the
   sentence to be reversed was the sentence of everlasting death; and
   therefore Christ alone could serve the turn. Here is another ground of
   comfort. Cyril calls it, kau'chema te`s katholikes ekklesi'as.

   [3.] This kinsman was to revenge the quarrel of his slain kinsman upon
   the murderer. So he is a Redeemer, and that not only by merit, but by
   power; not only as a lamb, but as a lion. There needed no price to be
   paid to Satan: we are redeemed from him, not by satisfaction, but by
   rescue. The apostle tells us, Col. ii. 15, He spoiled principalities
   and powers.' Luke xi. 21, He bindeth the strong man, and taketh away
   his goods.' Heb. ii. 14, 15, That through death he might destroy him
   that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who
   through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.' The
   devil had partly a usurped power over man, as the god of this world, or
   at least as the enemy of mankind; so Christ rescues us by force: partly
   a ministerial and permitted power, as the executioner of God's curse
   and vengeance; so he outlaweth him, and puts him out of office by the
   merit of his passion. Satan had no power over death as dominus mortis,
   as the supreme lord, that hath power to save and to destroy; but as
   minister mortis, as a hangman and executioner hath power from the law
   to put the male factor to death. So Christ destroyed him not in regard
   of essence, as if there were no more a devil to tempt and hurry us to
   destruction; nor in regard of malice, as if he did no longer seek to
   devour; but in regard of office and ministry; he is put out of office,
   and hath no more law-power to destroy those that have fled to Christ
   for refuge; and so hath freed us from all the fears of death and hell,
   which our guilt and Satan's temptations subjected us to.

   2. That he is their Redeemer is the next ground of comfort. Job doth
   not profess faith only in a Redeemer, but in his Redeemer: I know that
   my Redeemer liveth;' not by an uncharitable exclusion shutting out
   others, and engrossing the Redeemer to himself, but

   [1.] By a fiducial application making out his own title and interest.
   Some things in nature are common benefits, not lessened to any because
   others enjoy them, as a speech heard, and the sun shining, &c. The
   saints do not exclude others: 1 John ii. 2, And he is the propitiation
   for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole
   world;' 2 Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
   righteousness; not for me only, but for all them also that lot e his
   appearing.' This doth not lessen the benefit to us, and our obligations
   to him. Plato thought himself obliged in kindness to one that paid his
   fare for his passage over a river, and reckoned it positum apud
   Platonem officium, a courtesy that obliged Plato; but when he saw
   others partakers of the same benefit, he disclaimed the debt, and only
   took part of it on himself. Upon which Seneca groundeth this aphorism,
   that it is not enough for him that will oblige me to him to do me a
   good turn, unless he do it to myself directly--non tantum mihi, sed
   tanquam mihi; otherwise, quod debeo cum midtis, solvam cum multis. I
   will only pay my portion and share of thanks and respect. But this
   cannot be applied to this extraordinary kindness of Christ, for every
   man is indebted for the whole, not every man for a part of redemption.
   God's love to every one is infinite, and he hath paid an infinite price
   for thee, purchased an infinite happiness to thee. His love to thee was
   without measure and bounds, so must thy thankfulness be to him without
   stint and limit. Though he died for others as well as thee, yet thou
   art bound to love him no less than if it had been for thee alone; he
   shed his whole blood for thee, and every drop was poured out for thy
   sake.

   [2.] By a fiducial owning and appropriation, challenging his right in
   him. So doth Thomas: John xx. 28, My Lord and my God.' Faith
   appropriates God to our own use and comfort. The devils know that there
   is a God and a Christ, for they confessed, Thou art Jesus, the Son of
   the living God;' but they can never say with comfort, My God and my
   Christ.' This application is the ground of our love to Christ, and our
   comfort in Christ.

   Our love to Christ. Things that concern us affect us. This is the
   quickening motive to the spiritual life, Who loved me, and gave himself
   for me,' Gal. ii. 20; and 1 John iv. 19, We love him, be cause he loved
   us first.' A particular sense and experience of God's love to our own
   souls doth most quicken and awaken our love to him again, when we see
   that he hath thought of us, and taken care of our salvation, that our
   names are written in the Lamb's book of life.

   So for our comfort in Christ. It is the propriety a man hath to any
   good thing that doth increase the comfort of it. It is a misery to a
   man to see others enjoy a benefit which he hath as much need of as
   others, and he can enjoy no part of it. I may allude to that, Prov. v.
   15, Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of
   thine own well.' The greater we know the benefit, the greater will be
   our trouble to want it. A poor man that sees a large dole given, and
   multitudes relieved, and he can get nothing, is the more troubled. So
   here, to see Christ ready to save sinners, and we have no comfort by
   him, is very afflicting: Eph. i. 13, After ye heard the word of truth,
   the gospel of your salvation.' It is not sufficient to know that the
   gospel is a doctrine of salvation to others; but every one should
   labour, by a due application of the promises to their own hearts, to
   find it to be a doctrine of salvation to themselves in particular. The
   seeing of meat, though never so wholesome, doth not nourish, but the
   eating of it. The beholding of Christ revealed in the word as a Saviour
   in general is not sufficient to give full comfort, without applying him
   to be my Christ, my Saviour, my Redeemer. We must make sure of our
   share in this universal good. We read of blood shed and blood
   sprinkled, atonement made, and atonement received, but no man hath
   satisfying comfort by the blood of Christ till it be sprinkled upon his
   heart, and applied to him by the Spirit of God, and thereby assured
   that it was shed for him.

   3. The next ground of comfort is, that our Redeemer liveth. This is
   true of Christ, whether you consider him as God or as man. (1.) As God;
   so he is co-eternal with the Father, the first and the last,' the
   beginning of all things, and the end of them. So he saith not, he hath,
   or shall live, but he liveth.' In my flesh shall I see God.' He speaks
   of the Redeemer's life without any distinction of time--past, present,
   or to come; so that he is altogether, with the Father and the Spirit,
   from everlasting to everlasting, one living God. (2.) As man after his
   resurrection: Rev. i. 18, I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold
   I am alive for evermore, Amen. And have the keys of hell and of death.'
   Now in this sense I take it for his life in heaven after his
   resurrection from the dead; and that is of great comfort to us; for the
   apostle telleth us, that if we were reconciled by the death of Christ,
   much more shall we be saved by his life.' The comfort is great that
   arises from the life of the Redeemer.

   [1.] It is a visible demonstration of the truth of the gospel in
   general, and in particular of the article of eternal life. The truth of
   the gospel in general: Acts xvii. 31, Hath given assurance,' that is, a
   sufficient evidence to induce a belief of the gospel, in that he hath
   raised him from the dead.' Christ came from heaven as a faithful
   witness to beget faith as well as to give us knowledge, sealing his
   testimony with unquestionable proofs, to make it the more sure and
   credible to us, for he hath confirmed it by a life of miracles, and
   chiefly by rising from the dead himself, and ascending visibly to
   heaven. His resurrection from the dead is proof enough to justify his
   doctrine, and to evidence the certainty of his testimony; for God by
   his divine power would not countenance a deceiver, and raise him from
   the dead, and receive him into glory with himself. Particularly it
   proves the state of unseen glory; life and immortality are more fully
   brought to light in the gospel than by any other means, 2 Tim. i. 10.
   By the resurrection of Jesus Christ there is not only a clear
   revelation of it, but a full confirmation, because Christ is entered
   into the glory that he spake of, and promised to his disciples. He is
   gone before us into the other world, that he may receive us unto
   himself, and that we might, with a more steady confidence, wait for it
   in the midst of fears and uncertainties of the present life.

   [2.] His living after death. It was the solemn acquittance of our
   surety from the sins imputed to him, and a token of the acceptation of
   his purchase; when Christ rose again from the dead, our surety was let
   out of prison, Isa. liii. 8. And it is a ground of confidence to us,
   for when the debtor sees the surety walk abroad, he may be sure the
   debt is satisfied. Therefore it is said, Rom. iv. 25, Who was delivered
   for our offences, and raised again for our justification.' Christ is
   some times said to rise from the dead, and sometimes to be raised from
   the dead. His taking up his life again argued his divine power; but as
   man, he was raised. So it is said, Heb. xiii. 20, The God of peace, who
   brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ,' God the Father
   brought him again from the dead, as an evidence of full satisfaction.
   Our surety did not break prison, but was solemnly brought forth. The
   disciples said, Acts xvi. 37-39, Let them come themselves and fetch
   us.' An angel was sent from heaven to roll away the stone, to show that
   Christ had a solemn release and discharge.

   [3.] His living implies his capacity to intercede for us, and to
   relieve us in all our necessities: Heb. vii. 24, 25, But this man,
   because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood; therefore
   he is able to save to the uttermost all that come to God by him, seeing
   he ever liveth to make intercession for them.' Christ is there compared
   with the Levitical priesthood. They were many that succeeded one after
   another, and being hindered by death, could never bring their work to
   perfection; but this priest ever liveth to plead the church's cause
   with God, presenting his human nature in his sight, and appearing
   continually before his Father's throne, and this for all that come to
   God by him. They are his clients, and he is their advocate. It is
   against the rules of that court to plead for others that continue in
   their unbelief and impenitency. After the beast was slain without the
   camp, the Levitical high priest did enter into the sanctuary with
   blood; so Christ after his sacrifice did enter into the heavenly
   sanctuary with the names of the twelve tribes of all the saints on his
   breast and shoulders, there to appear before God for us, Heb. ix. 14.
   He ever liveth to accomplish the fruits of his purchase for those that
   are reconciled to God by him as a high priest, to answer the
   accusations of Satan as our advocate, to stop the breaking out of
   wrath. As Jonathan in Saul's court did mitigate his father's anger
   against David, so Christ doth interpose night and day to prevent
   breaches, and to preserve a mutual correspondence between God and us,
   as our lieger-agent; to sue out grace suitable to our conflicts,
   difficulties, and temptations, as our friend in court; to procure the
   acceptance of our prayers, as our mediator and intercessor, Heb. viii.
   2.

   [4.] His living is the root and cause of our life, for he having
   purchased eternal life, not only for himself, but for all his members,
   ever liveth to convey it to them, and maintain it in them: John xiv.
   19, Because I live, ye shall live also;' John vi. 57, As I live by the
   Father, so he that believeth in me shall live by me.' By reason of the
   mystical union that is between Christ and believers, they may rest upon
   it, that as long as the head hath life, the members shall not be
   utterly without life, for Christ is a pledge and a pattern of that
   power that shall work in us in order to life spiritual and eternal.

   4. The next ground of comfort is the certainty of persuasion: I know
   that my Redeemer liveth.' As if he had said, I do not doubt of it, nor
   suspect it in the least. I know implies:--

   [1.] A clear understanding of this mystery. The more fully we
   understand the grounds of faith, the more efficacy they have upon us to
   beget confidence and joy of faith in us. The fears that haunt us are
   the fruits of darkness and ignorance, accompanied with a sense of
   guilt; but as gospel-knowledge increases, they vanish as mists do
   before the sun: Ps. ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their
   trust in thee;' if God were better known, he would be better trusted.

   [2.] I know, implies certainty of persuasion. This is either certainty
   of faith, or of spiritual sense.

   First, Of faith, which depends on the certainty of God's revelation.
   That was either the general promise in paradise: Gen. iii. 15, God had
   said, The seed of the woman shall break the serpent's head.' Now upon
   this promise Job is as confident of a redeemer, as if he had seen him
   with his bodily eyes. Thus Abraham is said to have seen Christ's day:
   John viii. 56, and Heb. xi. 13, These all died in faith, not having
   received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were
   persuaded of them, and embraced them.' Or his faith was built upon some
   particular revelation: Heb. i. 1, God, who at sundry times, and by
   divers manners, spake unto the fathers by the prophets.' They had a
   sufficient discovery of the Redeemer to be a ground of faith. Certain
   it is, the eyes of believers were then upon him. We are told that
   Christ was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,' Rev. xiii.
   8. He is set forth in prophecies and types. Now faith is the evidence
   of things not seen;' not seen by sense, but clearly seen in the
   promise. He was the joy of all ages, even of those that lived before he
   came in the flesh. The same is true after the coming of Christ, as well
   as before, for we believe in him whom we have not seen,' 1 Peter i. 8.
   We should as heartily love him and rejoice in him as if we had
   conversed with him bodily. Only we have an advantage: history is not so
   dark as prophecy, and it is more easy to believe what is past, where we
   have the suffrage and experience of so many ages to confirm us, than to
   expect what is to come, where we have only God's bare word to support
   us. The mystery is now more clearly revealed to us than before the
   exhibition of our Saviour; therefore, according to our ad vantage, so
   should the increase of our faith be. We should be able to say, 2 Tim.
   i. 12, I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able
   to keep that which I have committed to him.' We should rest upon Christ
   with more confidence.

   Secondly, The certainty of spiritual sense. We know that he is a
   Redeemer by the discovery of the word; that he is our Redeemer by the
   application of the Spirit, as he manifests himself to us and in us.
   This knowledge of spiritual sense is often spoken of r Job xiii. 18, I
   know that I shall be justified;' Heb. x. 34, Knowing in yourselves that
   ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance;' Rom. vi. 6,
   Knowing this, that your old man is crucified,' that is, feeling. Now
   both these are of great comfort, the certainty of faith and the
   sweetness of sense; for without the certainty of faith, the soul is
   only left to blind guesses and loose conjectures, and so can never have
   solid comfort. Without the knowledge of sense, that is, of our interest
   in salvation, the soul loses much of its joy and peace. As novices and
   men that have never before been at sea are troubled at the swelling of
   every wave and billow though they are safe, yet, because they do not
   know they are safe, their voyage is a torment to them. So those that
   take the assurance of the word of God for the truth of redemption by
   Christ, and tremblingly build upon it, yet because they know not their
   own interest, have not the comfort of the Spirit, their journey to
   heaven is the more troublesome. Therefore it concerneth us to build
   upon a sure foundation, so to get a clear interest.

   II. How this is applicable in all afflictions. That easily appears from
   these premises:--

   1. In public troubles and difficulties. We are amazed and perplexed
   many times at the events that fall out in the world, and know not
   whereunto these things will grow. Yet this is some comfort and support
   to all that are concerned in Zion's affairs, that Christ is alive at
   his Father's right hand, and will pursue all things that make for the
   glory of God, and; the advancement of his own kingdom. I say, the glory
   of God: Rom. vi. 10, In that he liveth, he liveth unto God.' His own
   kingdom: Ps. cx. 1, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies
   thy footstool.' He is at the right hand of God, and there shall abide
   till he return to judge the world. In the meantime, he hath the
   inspection of all affairs: all judgment is put into his hands, John v.
   22. Things are not left to the will of man, nor to their own
   contingency, but are guided and ordered by him with good advice.
   However matters go, Christ is governor, who is not, cannot be deposed
   from his regal office, nor jostled out of the throne. As Luther said
   upon some loss that befell the friends of the gospel, Etiamnum vivit et
   regnat Christus. When the floods lifted up their voice, and all things
   seemed to threaten ruin and to overwhelm, then follows, The Lord
   reigneth; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,'
   Ps. xciii. 1,4. It is spoken of the kingdom of Christ, for the
   advancing and preserving of which he gives forth signal testimonies of
   his regal power.

   2. In spiritual distresses; when we want life and quickening, are
   opposed with troubled thoughts about our sinful infirmities. Your
   Redeemer hath life in himself, but not for himself alone; he came into
   the world that we might have a fuller communication of his grace, John
   x. 10. Now he is gone back again to God, and filled with the Spirit, to
   communicate it to the members of his mystical body: Eph. iv. 10, He is
   ascended up to fill all things.' When we are dead, our Redeemer liveth
   as a fountain of life to God's people.

   3. In outward calamities. He liveth when other comforts fail or are
   taken away from us; he will prove the nearest and best friend when all
   others forsake us; he will not only sympathise with us, but help us,
   and knoweth how to give a comfortable issue out of the sorest troubles:
   2 Cor. iv. 14, 16, Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
   raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For which
   cause we faint not.'

   4. It is a great comfort in calumnies and slanders, when our names are
   taken up in the lips of the taunters and cast forth as evil. Job here,
   when his friends suspected him as fallen from the grace of God, puts
   his cause into the hands of the great Mediator who was now with God in
   heaven, making intercession for him, and will one day stand on the
   earth judging the world. We need not fear any partial judge here below,
   nor be troubled at their prejudices and misconstructions. Christ is the
   true judge, who will bring to light the hidden things of the heart; and
   then shall every man have praise of God,' 1 Cor. iv. 5, that is, every
   one that hath done well. Though we have failings, yet those that flee
   to a Redeemer for pardon and reconciliation with God, and grace to walk
   uprightly, shall then be acquitted.

   5. Chiefly it is a comfort against the fears of death, that you may
   yield up yourselves into Christ's hands. Thoughts of dwelling with God
   in eternal life are less comfortable, because death and the grave
   interpose; we must pass through them before we can enjoy him. But
   though we die, Christ liveth, who is the resurrection, and those that
   believe in him shall live though they die, John xi. 25. For our souls,
   he standeth ready to receive them: Acts vii. 59, Lord Jesus, receive my
   spirit.' And our bodies at the last day shall be raised again to
   immortal life: When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, we shall
   appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 4.. We need not fear death, for by
   his dying and rising again the powers of the grave are shaken, and
   death itself is become mortal. The grave is not a prison, but a place
   of repose, Isa. lvii. 2; and death not a final extinction, but a
   passage into glory. It is ours: 1 Cor. iii. 22, All things are yours,
   life, death, things present, things to come; all are yours.' And it is
   gain: Phil. i. 21, For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.'
   Therefore we may go to the grave with comfort and hope. Christ died and
   yet is alive; so shall we. He is risen as the first-fruits of them that
   sleep,' 1 Cor. xv. 20. The whole harvest was blessed and sanctified by
   a handful of the first-fruits dedicated to God. When Christ arose, he
   virtually drew all the elect out of the grave with him; being renewed
   and reconciled by his grace, they may be confident of a joyful
   resurrection, for Christ is their fore-fruits. The first-fruits did not
   bless the tares, darnel, and cockle that grew amongst the corn; no man
   that ever offered the first-fruits desired a blessing upon the weeds.
   No; Bind the tares in bundles, and gather the wheat into my barn.' But
   if he indeed be your Redeemer, and hath redeemed you from all iniquity,
   that is, from the guilt and power of sin, it is a comfort to you to
   know that he lives gloriously with God, and will draw all his own after
   him, that they may live gloriously with him. He is our fore-runner,
   Heb. vi. 20, who is gone to heaven and hath taken possession for
   himself, and in our behalf, to make the way more passable for us. When
   we die, we do but go thither whither he is gone before us; he standeth
   upon the shore ready to receive us into glory.

   Use of Exhortation.

   I. Believe it and be persuaded of this truth, that you have a Redeemer
   living with God in the heavens.

   1 . This is a matter of mere faith, and therefore it must be soundly
   believed before it can have any efficacy upon us. Some points of faith
   are mixed, partly evident by natural reason, partly by divine
   revelation: as that there is a God; it is matter of sensible
   experience, Rom. i. 20, and a matter of faith also; whosoever comes to
   God must believe that God is.' Nature helpeth forward the entertainment
   of these things, but redemption by Christ is a matter of pure and mere
   faith, and is received by believing God's testimony, 2 Thes. i. 10.
   There is no improving these points till we soundly believe them.

   2. Because we often think we believe these general truths when in deed
   we do not believe them at all, or not with such a degree of assent as
   we imagine. Our Lord, when he speaks of these truths: John xi. 26, He
   that believeth in me shall live though he die; believest thou this?'
   John xvi. 31, Do ye now believe?' We conceit our faith to be much
   stronger than indeed it is about the main articles of faith.

   3. Because among them that profess themselves Christians, there are
   monstrous defects in their faith. Naturally we look upon the gospel as
   a well-devised fable, 2 Peter i. 16; and many that dare not speak it
   out, yet do but speak of Christ in jest and for fashion sake. I am sure
   most live as if there were no such matter, and the many impostures and
   cheats of Christendom, and the divisions and scandals amongst us, have
   weakened the faith of many, that were it not for shame they would turn
   professed infidels. There could not be such boldness in sinning, such
   coldness in spiritual and heavenly things, such neglect of Christ and
   heaven, if men were true and sound believers. Others content themselves
   with a negative sense; they do not question or contradict these
   articles of faith, because they do not consider them, but take up the
   common opinion, hand over head, and were never assaulted with
   temptations to the contrary; they do not doubt of it, say they; but are
   they rooted and grounded in the faith? Col. i. 23. Their not doubting
   comes from their non-attention. Others have a speculative assent; there
   is a certainty of evidence and a certainty of adherence. The former
   consisteth in the conviction of the mind, the latter in the bent of the
   will and affections. An object rightly propounded extorteth the former
   from the understanding, not expecting the consent of the will; the
   latter followeth imperium et consensum voluntatis. The former arises
   from the evidence of the thing; the latter from the consideration of
   the worth, weight, and greatness of it: 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a
   faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came
   into the world to save sinners.' They must not only be apprehended by
   us as true, but seriously considered as the highest and most important
   things, so as that we may adhere to them with all our hearts. It is
   such a belief of the gospel as produces a firm and cordial adherence,
   otherwise it will not serve the end and purpose of the gospel, which
   requireth us to crucify our lusts, sacrifice our interests, and perform
   those things which are unpleasing to nature upon the hopes it offereth
   to us, and with confidence and joyfulness to wait upon God for his
   salvation, in the midst of all pressures and afflictions. If your
   adherence were more firm, you would find your comfort more lively,
   fresh, and constant, your obedience more uniform, you would not be so
   shaken with temptations and assaults, and the incursion of worldly
   cares and sorrows. In great temptations the children of God see the
   need of a firm and cordial assent to the main gospel truths, Heb. vi.
   1, 2. Nay, in ordinary practices, in every prayer you make to God, Heb.
   x. 22, Let us draw nigh to God with a true heart, in full assurance of
   faith;' 1 Tim. ii. 8, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,
   lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.'

   4. Endeavour to arrive at the highest degree of assent. Faith is or
   should be strongly persuaded of what it believeth. It is an evidence,
   not a conjecture; not a surmise, but a firm assurance. We should
   certainly know what we believe: We know thou art a teacher sent from
   God,' John iii. 2; We know, and are sure, that thou art Christ, the Son
   of the living God,' John vi. 69; 2 Cor. v. 1, We know that we have a
   building of God;' 1 John iii. 2, We know that we shall see him as he
   is;' 1 Cor. xv. 58, Be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the
   work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.'
   Invisible things revealed by God should be certainly known, because God
   hath told us such clear, firm apprehensions become us. Faith is not a
   bare conjecture, but a certain knowledge; not we think, we hope well,
   but we know, is the language of faith. It is not a bare possibility we
   go upon, nor a probable opinion, but a certain, infallible truth. I put
   you upon this, partly because we have a great argument in the text. If
   Job could see it so long before it came to pass, should we not now see
   it? Believers of old make us ashamed who live in the clear sunshine of
   the gospel. Job lived long before the gospel was revealed; the
   redemption of souls was at that time a great mystery, being sparingly
   revealed to a few. But one of a thou sand could bring this message to a
   condemned sinner, that God had found a ransom, Job xxxiii. 23. Partly
   to put you upon earnest prayer to God, and other holy means. The Spirit
   opens our eyes and inclines our hearts: Eph. i. 17, 18, I cease not to
   give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the
   spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. The eyes of
   your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope
   of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
   the saints.'

   II. I exhort you to apply and improve it to your particular comfort. I
   shall speak:--

   1, To the careless.

   2. To the sensible.

   1. To the careless, who do not give diligence to make their interest
   clear, that they may be able to say, I know that my Redeemer liveth.'
   Some are contented so they may be well in the world, and live in peace,
   credit, and mirth here, but never look after an interest in the
   Redeemer, or to get a sure hope of a sentence of absolution from him at
   the last day. They content themselves with a general belief that Christ
   died for sinners, and only make use of it for the increase of their
   carnal security and boldness in sinning. We must not only consider what
   Christ hath done, but what we are to do that we may be partakers of the
   benefits. The general work of redemption Christ hath performed for us,
   without any consent on our part. He took our nature, fulfilled the law,
   satisfied the justice of God, merited grace; but we must thank fully
   receive him, live in him and to him, before this is applied to us, or
   we can have the comfort of it, 2 Cor. v. 17; xiii. 5. They content
   themselves to think and hope well, but do not make it sure upon good
   grounds. And when questions and scruples are raised in their hearts,
   there is not a full hearing of the matter, the court is broken up ere
   things are well determined; and so they run the hazard of uncertainty,
   and live and die venturing their souls upon the bare possibility of
   being saved, never put it out of doubt, nor assure their hearts before
   God,' 1 John iii. 19.

   2. To the sensible; to live upon this truth in the midst of their
   calamities, especially that they may enjoy the comfort of it in a dying
   hour.

   Object. You will say, We could take comfort in this, if we knew we had
   a Redeemer at God's right hand; but alas! after all our profession of
   the name of Christ, and long waiting upon God, I cannot make this close
   application, to say, My Redeemer liveth,' or My spirit rejoices in God
   my Saviour,' Luke i. 47.

   Ans. But cannot you bless God for the gospel, and the offers of pardon
   and life by him? The main foundation of comfort lies in the general
   truths; your hopes are not built chiefly upon the sense of your own
   interest, but the ransom which Christ hath paid for you. Is it nothing
   to you that God should become man, and your judge your kinsman? John i.
   14. Surely goodness and mercy is nearer to us in our own nature than it
   was in the divine nature. We have an apparent demonstration of it to
   us, that Christ would come among us to bring home souls to God, Heb.
   vi. 17, 18. Again, is it nothing that, in this nature of ours, he would
   pay our ransom, that none should perish for want of a sufficient
   satisfaction to God's justice, but for want of a willing heart to
   accept and own his Redeemer? John iii. 16, 17; Rev. iii. 24-26. We are
   so far onward in our way. Again, is it nothing to us that our Redeemer
   will rescue us out of the hand of the destroyer? 1 John iii. 8. It is
   his office. This should prevail with us, not to tie the cord the
   faster, but to wait upon him with the more hope if you desire his aid
   to this end and purpose, for it is his office. Again, is it nothing to
   you that this Redeemer liveth; that Christ, in your nature, rose again,
   and is now at God's right hand, to manage the causes of poor sinners?
   Rom. viii. 34. St Paul's triumph hence ariseth. Lastly, is it nothing
   to you to know this, that God hath sent the gospel to you, and given
   you faith of these things? 1 John v. 20, We know the Son of God is
   come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is
   true.' Is this favour nothing? These are the truths you must live upon.

   Secondly, To those that question whether Christ be our Redeemer,
   whether they may look upon themselves as having an actual interest in
   the benefits of his death and intercession.

   I answer--This is evident: (1.) By their own act; (2.) By God's act.

   1. Their own act. General grace must some way be made particular, else
   it cannot profit us. All are not justified, nor adopted, nor saved.
   There is the same merciful God, the same all-sufficient Saviour, the
   same gracious covenant. Some apply this grace, others do not. Christ
   doth not save us at a distance, but as received into our hearts; as a
   plaster doth not heal at a distance, but applied to the sore: John i.
   13, To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
   sons of God.' If you heartily consent and accept of the Redeemer's
   grace to heal your wounded souls, you shall partake of salvation.

   2. There is an act on God's part. What have you to show that God is
   reconciled to you? This is not evident till we have the pledge of our
   reconciliation with God, the gift of the Holy Spirit. This affords
   infallible assurance of God's favour. Other things may be given in
   wrath, but the Spirit is the earnest of his eternal love. God loved
   Christ, and gave him the Spirit without measure, John iii. 34. By the
   Spirit his love is applied to us, Rom. v. 5. This is the evidence from
   whence we may conclude our actual communion with God. It holdeth good
   exclusively, Rom. viii. 9; inclusively, 1 John iv. 13. The Spirit first
   works, and then witnesses; he is first a guide and sanctifier, then a
   comforter. As a guide, he leadeth us to all truth: John xvi. 13, When
   the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth;' Rom.
   viii. 14, As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God.' As a sanctifier, he breaketh the power of fleshly lusts, Rom.
   viii. 13; conformeth us to the image of Christ, Rom. viii. 29. Then as
   a comforter, he witnesseth our present interest and our future hopes:
   Rom. viii. 16, The Spirit beareth witness to our spirits, that we are
   the children of God;' 2 Cor. i. 22, Who hath also sealed us, and given
   us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts;' Eph. i. 13, In whom also,
   after ye believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.'

SERMON XIII

   And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.--1 Tim. VI.
   8.

   THE apostle hath mentioned some in the 5th verse that counted gain was
   godliness;' that is, suited their godliness with their worldly ends, or
   made a trade of it to live by. Their religion must bear all their
   charges, they would be at no cost about it at all. The apostle takes
   occasion to show that their notion may be right if well interpreted,
   though extreme wrong in the sense they mean it. It was impious in them
   to make Christianity a means to secular advantages; but interpret it
   aright, Godliness with contentment is great gain,' much better than all
   the wealth in the world. By godliness he means the Christian religion,
   because it prescribeth and delivereth the true way of worshipping and
   serving God, and they gain fairly that gain Christ. A man that is
   acquainted with God in Christ is the true rich man; this with
   contentment is great gain. Our worldly desires make us poor. You have
   enough if you be contented with the condition wherein God places you.
   Paul retorts their own notions upon them. He is a rich man that doth
   not possess much and hath need of little. Anything above a competency
   is needless to us, who must shortly pass out of this life into another.
   Nature is contented with a little, and grace with less; because it is
   manifest that as we brought nothing into this world, so we can carry
   nothing out,' and all that we have above what we spend or use is lost
   to us. In the text he inferreth his inference: Having food and raiment,
   let us be therewith content.' The words are plain, and afford this
   observation:--

   Doct. That one great point of godliness is to be content with what we
   have, though it be but food and raiment.

   In handling this point, I shall inquire:--

   I. What contentment is.

   II. What considerations are most apt to breed it.

   III. That it is a high point of Christianity.

   I. What contentment is. It is a quiet temper of mind about outward
   things; and so it is opposite to three things--murmurings, distracting
   cares, and covetous desires.

   1. Murmurings: Jude 16, Murmurers, complainers.' The word signifies
   blamers of their portion; they are always picking quarrels at God's
   dispensation, and entertain crosses with anger and blessings with
   disdain. But now, when our minds are satisfied with the fitness and
   sufficiency of our present condition, there is no repining against God,
   no fretting and tearing ourselves; the mind is framed to the estate, be
   it never so mean.

   2. Distrustful and distracting cares. Men are full of troubles,
   especially when they are in a hazardous strait and low condition;
   therefore God forbids this: Mat. vi. 25, Take no thought for your life,
   what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; or yet for the body, what
   you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
   raiment?' Men are fearful and anxious for the future, and doubt whether
   God will allow them the necessaries of life, food, and raiment;
   therefore it is said, Luke xii. 29, Be not ye of a doubtful mind.' They
   distract themselves with these anxious thoughts. The word properly
   signifies to be carried in the air, as clouds, by an uncertain motion;
   and so it is applied to them who are tossed about with out consistency
   or fixedness of mind, by an impatient suspense or anxious solicitude
   about God's providence.

   3. Covetous desires: Heb. xiii. 5, Let your conversation be without
   covetousness, and be content with such things as you have.' The apostle
   speaks there of times of persecution; and no temper of mind is so fit
   for us in such times as contentation with whatever God at present
   allows us. They that are greedy of more forget or dislike what they
   have already. There is no reason for it; for what use is there of more
   than what may nourish us within and cover us without? But we punish
   ourselves with our own wild desires. Well, then, contentation is
   opposite to all these; it is such a quiet of mind as suiteth our hearts
   to our condition, and relieth upon God's merciful providence and
   gracious promises for support and necessaries during our service in the
   world, without being troubled about other things.

   II. What considerations are offered and implied in the text as most apt
   to breed it.

   1. That God is a sovereign Lord, and dispenses these outward things at
   his pleasure. We are not proprietaries; we must only content ourselves
   with the use, or a transitory fruition: Luke xvi. 12, If you have not
   been faithful in another's, who will give you that which is your own?'
   That others is God, who is the dispenser and disposer of these things.
   The whole drift of the parable is to show that we are but stewards: God
   reserves the sovereign right to himself gives us only the use or trust
   for our own and others' good. No man esteemeth himself to be an owner
   of that which another besides himself hath power to dispose of, as God
   hath, of us and of all that belongeth to us. Our possession of anything
   is but limited and respective. We are but tenants at the will of the
   Lord; he can take us from our ser vice, or our service from us at his
   own pleasure: Job ix. 12, Behold, he takes away, who can hinder him?
   Who will say to him, What doest thou?' God hath an absolute power, his
   right is uncontrollable; so is not ours. Now, this hath a great
   influence upon contentedness with our condition; for if we and all that
   we have be God's own, he may do with his own as it pleases him, Mat.
   xx. 15. If he takes any thing from us, he doth but require his own; and
   nothing more reason able but that every one should have liberty to
   dispose of what is his own according to his will. Every one of you must
   say, I am God's creature; he may use me for his glory, in what manner
   and in what rank and degree he pleaseth.

   2. It is the wisdom and will of God not to give to all alike, that some
   should have more and some should have less. He puts ten talents into
   the hands of some of his servants, and but one into an other's, Mat.
   xxv. Therefore if your portion be straiter than others, it is what God
   hath allotted: 1 Sam. ii. 7, 8, The Lord makes poor and the Lord makes
   rich; he bringeth low and he lifteth up: he setteth some among the
   princes, and to inherit the throne of glory,' whilst others sit on the
   dunghill or roll in the dust. The world is not governed by chance, nor
   is it the blind idol fortune that dispenses honours and estates, but
   every man's portion and the bounds of his habitation are set forth by
   God. It comes not from second causes, or an uncertain rolling about the
   sphere of human mutability, but God's ordinance and appointment, who,
   as he hath cast the world into hills and valleys, hath made the estate
   of one man differ from another. No estate in this world is universally
   good for all, as no gale of wind can serve for all passengers on the
   deep waters. Nor doth the same weather fit every soil; that drought
   which burneth up the hotter grounds comforteth those which are more
   chill and cold. If one man had another's blessings he would soon run
   wild, as another would grow desperate if he had their crosses.
   Therefore the infinite wisdom of the great Governor of the world allots
   every one his portion. God knows the reasons of this unequal
   distribution, though they be hidden from us. Now, this also hath an
   influence upon contentment, for we ought to submit to the good pleasure
   of God, and can no more quarrel with his providence for keeping us low
   and bare than his creation, that he made us men and not angels, or that
   he will furnish the world with all kind of creatures, worms and beasts
   as well as men: Isa. xlv. 9, Shall the clay say to the potter, Why hast
   thou made me thus?'

   3. These earthly things, which are thus variously dispensed, are only
   useful to us during the present life in the mortal body. In heaven we
   have no need of these things, and we must leave them all on this side
   the grave: 1 Cor. vi. 13, Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats;
   but God shall destroy both it and them.' Meats are appointed by God and
   nature for the use of men, and the body of man in this life hath
   absolute necessity of them; but in the next life, which is a spiritual
   life, this eating and desiring of meat shall be taken away. It is a
   mercy to have meat when we are hungry, and garments to cover our
   nakedness when cold, but it is a greater mercy to be above these
   necessities. Well, now, this life is but short and uncertain; it is but
   a coming into the world and a going out again: Job i. 21; 1 Tim. vi. 7,
   We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that we can carry
   nothing out.' Now, we that are ready to step into another world, and
   are certain within a short time to be stripped for ever of all these
   things, what great matter is it if God keep us low and bare? All will
   shortly be as poor as you, and a little time should make but a little
   difference. That is not our true wealth and riches which we cannot
   carry away with us; what is left behind is not ours, but other men's;
   and therefore, whilst you are alive, you should not be much troubled
   about that which you cannot enjoy when you are dead. If we have what
   will serve for our passage, what should we do with more? We cannot
   carry away our riches along with us, but the sting and guilt of
   mis-enjoying them and mis-employing them will be sure to stick by us
   both in death and judgment. It is riot the possession, but the use that
   will comfort us. Though we cannot carry our estates into the other
   world, yet the comfort of a good conscience we may carry with us: Their
   works follow them,' Rev. xiv. 13. Then they go to enjoy the eternal
   reward of bliss and peace for their hard and painful service here in
   the world.

   4. The comfort, safety, and happiness of this life lies not in
   abundance: Luke xii. 15, Take heed and beware of covetousness; for a
   man's life lies not in the abundance of things which he possesseth.'
   This consideration is added because some might think, though we can
   carry nothing out of the world, yet whilst we live we should seek
   larger supplies. Our Lord answereth this surmise: Though outward things
   are very useful to sustain life, yet no man is able to prolong his
   life, or to make it more happy and comfortable to him, by possessing
   more than he needs or uses. What good will the superfluity of wealth do
   him? These things are extrinsical to our being and happiness. When you
   have the world at will, you can get no more from it than bodily food
   and bodily clothing. The poorest may attain to that. It is no great
   matter whether our dung or excrements be of finer matter or coarser;
   whether a gay show we make in our apparel, so we have for warmth and
   decency; whether few or more dishes at our table. Too much oil puts out
   the lamp, and superfluity afflicts and oppresseth that part which it
   seems to gratify. When men have troubled themselves and the world to
   make themselves great, what a sorry happiness have they! Their net and
   their drag, by which they catch men as a fisherman doth fishes in the
   sea, it all tendeth to this, that their portion may be fat and
   plenteous. A poor felicity, that they have a little good cheer and a
   merry life here. They that want such abundance live as well as they,
   and have as much health and contentment: Ps. xvii. 14, They have their
   portion in this life, and their bellies are filled with hid treasures,
   and they leave the rest to their babes.' They ransack the storehouses
   of nature to satisfy their gluttony and excess, but yet all this while
   they are not the nearer to contentment, nor farther off from the grave.
   So that it is best to be content with necessaries.

   5. Nothing besides food and raiment is absolutely necessary. By food is
   meant something to nourish u, and by raiment something to cover us. If
   you indulge wanton appetites, if you make provision for the flesh, or
   ask meat for your lusts, God will not hear nor regard your desires.
   Jacob desires but food and raiment of God: Gen. xxviii. 20, If God be
   with me, and keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to
   eat, and raiment to put on, then God shall be my God.' But how could he
   put his owning and acknowledging of God upon these terms? The meaning
   is, this shall be a new engagement, esteeming it as a great favour. All
   our desires should be suited, not to our luxury, but the necessity of
   nature; raiment, not ornament; necessary supports, not delicacies:
   therefore we should not make lust a wanton, but be content if God will
   any way enable us to serve and glorify him. We should be content with
   his allowance; it is enough for the service and honour which he
   expecteth from us, and to carry us through that little time which we
   have to spend in the world. It is not abundance that we need, but a
   contented heart: let a little suffice, if God gives no more. Diseased
   persons need more attendance than the healthy; the distempers of our
   souls multiply our necessities, and as we indulge them they gain upon
   us; therefore every one of us should bring himself to be content with
   necessaries. Superfluities are an impediment rather than a help, as a
   shoe too big for the foot hinders our going, or as David could not go
   on with Saul's armour, because it was too great for him, 1 Sam. xvii.
   39. We are freest from temptations when we have least, though enough
   for health, strength, and cheer fulness.

   6. Food and raiment are not hard to be obtained. I do not mean with
   respect to our endeavours, but God's blessing; for in these things God
   will not forsake us. We have a heavenly Father, who knows what we stand
   in need of, Mat. vi. 32. They that have least from God have ordinarily
   food and raiment vouchsafed to them; he will not leave his people to
   unsupportable difficulties; our condition is tolerable, if not
   comfortable, 1 Cor. x. 13. He hath wonderful means to help, when all
   their supplies are removed out of the view of sense. It is notable to
   observe, the Israelites were not plagued when they murmured out of
   want, but when they murmured out of wantonness. Heal wants, we may
   rationally presume, will be supplied, not fancies and carnal appetites.
   As for instance: Ps. lxxviii. 21, Therefore the Lord heard this, and
   was wroth, and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger came up
   against Israel.' Therefore--why? When he had taken care to supply their
   wants by giving them plenty of water out of the rock of Horeb, and by
   sending manna in the morning and quails in the evening, yet they fell a
   murmuring and complaining, preferring their condition in Egypt before
   that which God had brought them into. They must have a table better
   furnished with bread and flesh; they were clogged with this manna, not
   contented with a provision for their wants, but required a satisfaction
   to their appetites. This highly displeased and provoked God, and
   brought very sharp punishments upon them. So again, Ps. cvi. 14, 15,
   They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the
   desert, and he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their
   souls.' Their minds ever and anon ran upon the flesh-pots of Egypt; and
   because they had not that festival plenty in the wilderness, they
   murmured as if Moses had brought them out of Egypt to die there, and
   God must show more miracles, not to supply their wants but to pamper
   their lusts.

   7. This life was given us to seek a better, and therefore the felicity
   of it must not be measured by a more ample portion of food and raiment,
   but as we are fitted and prepared for the better life, which is the end
   and scope of life itself. All these things are but your provision in
   the way to heaven, therefore not principally to be sought after; your
   business is to serve God, and seek the salvation of your souls: Mat.
   vi. 33, Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and
   all these things shall be added unto you;' that is, there will be
   enough to sustain us in our journey to heaven, whilst we are preparing
   for eternity, and therefore we should be content.

   8. Many times the less we have in this life the more fervently is the
   life to come sought after; a moderate estate is freest from
   temptations. Abundance of all things without any want inclines us to a
   forgetfulness of God; as, on the other side, perpetual want, without
   any cheerful taste of God's goodness, disposes men to atheism. In the
   two extremes religion is either starved or choked. We see it in
   countries and persons: in countries. Sodom and Gomorrah, which was as
   the garden of God, Gen. xiii. 10, was the first instance of unnatural
   sin, and an example of supernatural judgment. Some in great prosperity
   have no thoughts of God and the world to come; others that live in
   sordid poverty never consider the goodness of God, and so live and die
   miserable creatures. The middle estate is freest from danger, and
   religion is most secured in it: Prov. xxx. 8, 9, Give me neither
   poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be
   full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and
   steal, and take the name of God in vain.' Pride and insolency are
   incident to the one, and any base dealing to the other. A great estate,
   like a rank soil, is more apt to breed weeds; and bitter necessity be
   trays us to any base shift for our sustenance; therefore if God gives
   us anything to live upon, we should be content.

   9. That God best knows what will do us good or hurt, and therefore we
   should refer it to him to dispose of us according to his own pleasure.
   Certainly we should not want if God saw it better for us to abound, for
   he is no niggard of his blessings, but is good, and doth good. But it
   is not meet that man should have the disposal of himself, or his own
   condition and affairs, or that God should accommodate his providence to
   our carnal interest and will No; God's will must always precede, and
   ours follow. We have a corrupt will, guided by a dark understanding;
   and if the blind lead the lame, what can be expected but disorder and
   ruin? Therefore our wills must not lead and make the first choice, but
   God's. We must bring our hearts thoroughly to yield to what God
   appointeth, and that our present estate is best for us. How unmeet
   judges are flesh and blood of what condition is fit for us! We would be
   fed only with the delicacies of prosperity and pleasure, but it is for
   our profit that we should be chastened, that we should be partakers of
   his holiness,' Heb. xii. 10, 11. What a strange creature would man be
   if he were what he would wish himself to be! Vainly proud, stupidly
   careless, and neglectful of God and heavenly things; therefore our best
   way is to be what God will have us be: Not my will but thine be done,'
   Mat. xxvi. 39.

   10. We must be contented with a competency, but yet we ought to be
   fitted and prepared for eternity. If God please to give us conveniency,
   it is his great mercy; but our resolutions must be to be contented with
   any condition God will put us into: we except not life itself out of
   our resignation. The people of God are wont to suppose not only some
   necessity but an extremity: Hab. iii. 18, Yet will I rejoice in the
   Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.' He saith not, If I have
   only food, and raiment, and hard fare, it shall suffice me. No; but If
   the labour of the olive shall fail, and the field shall yield no meat,
   and the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no
   herd in the stalls.' In many cases poverty may come upon us like an
   armed man, and spoil us of all: but when we seem to be starved in the
   creature, yet then we may feast in God. God's children do not
   capitulate with him how much they will suffer and no more, but resolve
   to bear the heaviest burden, to submit to the sharpest affliction. So
   again, Ps. xliv. 19, 20, Though thou hast sore broken us in the place
   of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death, yet we have not
   forgotten the name of our God, or proved unfaithful to him.'

   III. The reasons why it is a high point of Christianity to get
   contentation with any estate God shall put us into are:--

   1. In the general, it is a mystery only learned in Christ's school:
   Phil. iv. 11-13, I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be
   therewith content; and I know how to be abased and to abound: I am
   instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to
   suffer need; I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.'
   This art is not soon learned. What is there in Christianity above other
   disciplines to teach us this contentation? The doctrine of God's
   particular providence, fatherly care, and eternal life,--these,
   seconded by the sanctifying operation of the Holy Ghost, cause this
   resolution in us, to encounter all the difficulties of this present
   life in a humble and quiet mind.

   2. More particularly, let us consider--(1.) What is necessary to this
   contentment; (2.) What effect it produces.

   [1.] What is necessary to this contentment.

   (1.) Faith, or a sound belief of God's being and gracious promises and
   eternal recompenses; that there is a God, that he hath a particular
   care of human affairs, and that he will not leave his people to
   unsupportable difficulties, but will guide them to eternal life. It is
   in vain to press people to contentedness till they be thus persuaded.
   For the first truth, that there is a God: He that cometh to God must
   believe that God is.' For the second truth, that he hath a particular
   care of human affairs: 1 Peter v. 7, Cast all your care upon the Lord,
   for he careth for you.' The third truth, that he will riot leave his
   people to unsupportable difficulties: Heb. xiii. 5, 6, Let your
   conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things
   as you have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake
   thee; so that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear
   what man shall do unto me.' For the fourth truth, a prospect of eternal
   life: Luke xii. 32, Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
   good pleasure to give you the kingdom.' Now if God be, and be thus
   engaged to his people, why should we be discontented if he takes his
   own methods to bring us to everlasting glory? We cannot suffer anything
   that God is not aware of; every dram of our affliction is weighed out
   to us by that all-wise, all-merciful Providence; and there is nothing
   which we suffer that he knoweth not how to turn to our good, looking
   for nothing from us but our trust and thankfulness.

   (2.) It conies from humility, when we are content to be at God's
   finding, knowing that we have deserved nothing from him: Gen. xxxii.
   10, I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of all thy
   truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff passed
   I over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.' The humble man is
   content to be dealt with as the Lord pleases. Prescribing to God always
   comes from ascribing to ourselves. We think we have deserved more than
   he gives us. We, that are worthy of the heaviest judgment, surely
   should be thankful for the smallest mercy: Eccles. vii. 8, The patient
   in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.' Patience is rooted in
   humility, but discontent in pride.

   (3.) It comes from weanedness from the world. They that do not seek
   great things for themselves will stand to God's allowance. It may be
   God may bestow great things upon them, as he did upon Abraham and
   David, but they do not seek them, especially in times when it is a
   mercy they have life and liberty. That is forbidden, Jer. xliv. 5. In
   short, grace doth all, both as to poverty and riches, and makes rich
   and poor stand on the same level. Now this is a high point in religion,
   to grow dead to the world, to behave ourselves in a manner as
   unconcerned in poverty or riches; for the world is the great impediment
   to the heavenly life, as being the bait of the flesh, the snare of
   Satan, by which he detaineth souls from God. If once we grow
   indifferent to these things, we would not feel any great power in
   temptations to pleasure, wealth, and honour, and would soon be thorough
   Christians; the spiritual life would be more easy and even. Easy, for
   where men seek no great things for themselves in the world, and a
   little matter contenteth their desires, and checketh their murmurings,
   the resistance of the carnal nature to the empire of grace is without
   much difficulty overcome; they can enjoy plenty or want, renounce their
   aspiring thoughts, meddle sparingly with fleshly delights, they are
   seeking a better estate. More evenly; there is no notable blemish on
   them who are crucified to the world; they do not stain their
   profession, wound their consciences. Their choices are governed by
   religion, not by carnal interest; they are kept unspotted from the
   world,' James i. 27.

   [2.] The fruits it produces. I shall name but two of many.

   (1.) They are not distracted with great worldly business. They esteem
   that to be the best way that brings them nearest to their great end,
   which is not to enjoy happiness in this life, but in the world to come.
   Those whose hearts are all for the present, they must have the world to
   the full, or they are not contented; they never think of laying up
   treasure in heaven, Mat. vi. 19, 20. That is not their end and scope,
   but to live commodiously here, that they and their posterity may
   flourish in the world: Ps. xvii. 14, They which have their portion in
   this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasures, they
   are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their
   babes.' But a good man that eyes another happiness, is not much
   troubled how it is with him here, so he and his may be accepted with
   God hereafter. Therefore their business is not to lay up treasure to
   themselves on earth, but to be rich towards God, Luke xii. 21.

   (2.) They that can be contented with a little, are most likely to be
   true to God and conscience. They can better suffer hunger, thirst,
   nakedness, and other troubles for the gospel: Acts xx. 24, None of
   these things move me;' that is, made no great opposition and
   perturbation in his mind. It is no strange thing to them when trials
   come. They can part with all things under the sun, rather than quit
   their duty to Christ; for temptations have lost their force when
   worldly desires and lusts are mortified. They withered in persecution
   that received the good seed for a time, Mark iv. 17. When religion
   carries one way, and the world another, then farewell religion for the
   world's sake. When Christ had spoken so much of the cross, then Judas
   turneth apostate. When Demas saw the world went on otherways, he
   forsook Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 10. When Christ told the young man of parting
   with all, he went away sad, Mark x. 22. If heaven cost so dear, it is
   no pennyworth for him. So men will come into no danger or trouble for
   Christ, because they are not contented with a little.

   Use 1. If the godly ought to be content with food and raiment, it shows
   the vanity of men's vast desires; they have much above food and
   raiment, yet they are not satisfied. A true Christian is contented with
   necessaries, but worldly men enlarge their desires as hell.' Hab. ii.
   5. They are so far from acquiescing in their portion assigned to them
   by God, though it be competent and enough to satisfy their wants, yea,
   and far beyond (so that many are glad of their leavings); yet they are
   always hunting after more, like death and the grave, which are never
   satisfied. They are restless, still adding, if they be princes, kingdom
   to kingdom; if they be churchmen, preferment upon preferment; and if
   ordinary men, estate upon estate, house to house, field to field. These
   desires are pettishly solicited, eagerly followed, and many times
   finally disappointed.

   2. It checks our impatiency under disappointment. If we have not our
   will in worldly things, we are troubled, our desires are too ardent. We
   must needs have them, cannot be without them, trouble ourselves about
   them, and so murmur and repine against God; and this breedeth fearful
   tempests in the soul. As Jonah bitterly contended with God about his
   gourd, Jonah iv., and Rachel, Give me children, or else I die,' Gen.
   xxx. 1. If we cannot have what we would, all is nothing. Ahab is sick
   for one poor vineyard. Haman counteth his honour nothing as long as
   Mordecai sits at the king's gate. As in a carriage, if one pin be
   wanting all is at a stop.

   3. It shows the evil of our distrust, notwithstanding we have God's
   fatherly providence and promises to rely upon, and so large a covenant
   interest: 1 Cor. iii. 21-23, All things are yours, and ye are Christ's,
   and Christ is God's.' All things are yours, ordinances, providences,
   this world, the next, life, death. Would you have more? All are
   instrumental for our good, if we resolve to be faithful to Christ.

SERMON XIV.

   I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
   nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
   riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but
   time and chance happeneth to them all.--Eccles. IX. 11.

   THE whole book is a search after true happiness. The particular
   paragraph whereof the text is a branch proveth that it cannot be
   obtained in this world, because of the various events of God's powerful
   and unsearchable providence. The discourse beginneth, chap. viii. 16,
   17, When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
   which is done upon the earth, then I beheld all the works of God, that
   a man cannot find out the work which is done under the sun: because
   though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea
   farther, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
   to find it,' God's providence in the government of the world is secret
   When a wise man hath applied his mind to reconcile all the seeming
   incongruities of it, he cannot get a clear and satisfying account of
   all the proceedings thereof, but must at last acquiesce in the
   sovereignty and dominion of God. The footsteps of providence are not
   easily traced, his judgments are a great depth, Rom. xi. 33; Ps. xxxvi.
   6, xcii. 5. They may be adored, but not searched into.

   Now two things in our reflection upon providence perplex us:--

   1. One is, that things are promiscuously dispensed to good and bad men;
   yea, many times the good are afflicted, and the bad are advanced. To
   this he speaketh in the beginning of the chapter, where he showeth that
   all outward things are dispensed without any great difference. Josiah
   died in the war, and so did Ahab. Is Abraham rich? so is Nabal. Is
   Solomon wise? so is Ahithophel. Is Joseph honoured by Pharaoh? so is
   Doeg by Saul. Had Isaac long life? Gen. xxv. 20, so had Ishmael, Gen.
   xxv. 17.

   2. The other perplexity is, that events and successes do fall out
   otherwise than the preparation and ability of second causes do seem to
   promise. As holiness and unholiness do not make the difference, so the
   natural ability and inability of man, the wisdom and folly, the
   strength and weakness, make no difference as to their worldly
   condition. Men of greatest abilities are disappointed of their hopes
   and ends, which weak and insufficient men do many times obtain. Now
   this is asserted in the text: I returned and saw,' &c.

   In which words observe the preface and observation; or--

   I. The accurate inspection of the wise man: I returned, and saw under
   the sun.

   II. The result of this inspection and observation, propounded
   negatively and positively.

   First, Negatively, in five particulars.

   1. The race is not to the swift.

   2. Nor the battle to the strong.

   3. Nor yet bread to the wise.

   4. Nor riches to men of understanding.

   5. Nor favour to men of skill.

   Secondly, Positively: but time and chance happeneth to them all.

   I. His accurate inspection: I returned and saw under the sun;' that is,
   besides all the former vanities of the present life. The same phrase is
   used chap. iv. 1, I returned, and considered all the oppressions that
   are done under the sun.' So ver. 7 of that chapter: Then I returned,
   and saw vanity under the sun.' This phrase is used to show the great
   certainty and evidence of his observation; it is a thing I have
   narrowly observed. The instruments of knowledge are seeing, hearing,
   observing, and deducing inferences from thence. Under the sun, that is,
   here in this lower world; I considered all human actions, the things
   which are done in this life among men; he looked about and turned
   himself every way.

   II. The observation thence resulting.

   First, Negatively, propounded in five instances, which comprehend nil
   the business of the common life: neither swiftness, nor strength, nor
   wisdom, &c.

   1. The race is not to the swift. This may be understood either of the
   ordinary race, wherein the swift may sometimes fail, or, straining
   themselves beyond their strength, be mischiefed in their bodies, or
   maimed by some accident; and so, when he speaketh of the race, he
   meaneth it of the successful race, as in the next clause: nor the
   battle to the strong; he meaneth the successful battle, whereby they
   get the victory. Success is not always on the side of the swift and the
   strong. Or secondly, of any course whereby a man endeavours to outrun
   danger. So Asahel, who was swift of foot as a wild roe, was slain by
   Abner, 2 Sam. ii. 18, 23; and Jer. xlvi. 6, The swift shall not flee
   away, nor the mighty man escape;' they shall stumble and fall. The
   swift cannot always flee from danger: Isa. xxx. 16, They that pursue
   you shall be swift.'

   2. Nor the battle to the strong. Rabshakeh telleth us that Counsel and
   strength are for the war,' Isa. xxxvi. 5. But many times great strength
   is foiled, and a small army overcomes a greater. The strength of the
   mighty doth not always avail them to fight and conquer. Thus was
   Goliath foiled by David, 1 Sam. xvii. 50; and Gideon's three hundred
   overthrew the mighty host of Midian, Judges vii. 7; and we are told,
   Ps. xxxiii. 16, There is no king saved by the multitude of his host;
   and a mighty man is not delivered by much strength;' and 1 Sam. xiv. 6,
   There is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.'

   3. Nor yet bread to the wise. Bread is put for all means of
   subsistence, and many wise men have been hard put to it. Certainly
   wisdom doth much to get a livelihood in the world: Prov. xxi. 20, There
   is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the house of the wise.' Yet
   many times it falleth out that men of great wisdom scarce get a
   subsistence in the world. As David was put to desire supplies from
   Nabal, a fool. And we are told by Solomon, that folly is set in great
   dignity when the wise sit in low place,' Eccles. x. 6. Paul was in
   hungerings often and fastings often,' not voluntary but enforced, 2
   Cor. xi. 27. Yea, it is said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that certain
   women ministered to him of their substance for his support, Luke viii.
   3.

   4. Nor riches to men of understanding. Experience often verifieth this,
   that the learned are very poor, when lesser wits and mean people get
   great substance. We read in scripture of a rich fool, Luke xii. 20, and
   a poor wise man, Eccles. ix. 15; and, in the general, that it is the
   blessing of the Lord maketh rich,' Prov. x. 22. He is behindhand with
   none of his creatures; he giveth to some wit, to others riches.

   5. Nor favour to men of skill. To attain favour with men it availeth
   not to be skilful, that is, able and well experienced, unless God add
   the blessing thereunto. Suppose favour in the eyes of princes or the
   people. Alas! men of no desert are promoted, as Doeg by Saul. And the
   populacy are carried away with slight persons, rather than those of the
   greatest wisdom and parts.

   Secondly, Positively: but time and chance happeneth to them all. Hence
   are two things mentioned which do much befriend worldly matters--

   1. Time.

   2. Chance.

   1. Time, whereby is meant occasion and opportunity. There is a certain
   time which God hath allotted to every purpose and action, which if men
   had the wisdom to take hold of, their business would better succeed;
   but because man knoweth not his time, great is his misery upon earth,'
   therefore he effecteth not the things he goeth about.

   2. The next word is chance, or occurrence; so is the word translated 1
   Kings v. 4, The Lord hath given me rest, so that there is neither
   adversary nor evil occurrent;' it is the same word. The success is such
   as the counsel of God hath foreordained, yet to us it chanceth [22] to
   be a mere chance and adventure. In short, that which God hath from all
   eternity ordained, shall and must come to pass at such a time as God
   hath ordained it should be, and likewise in such a manner, and by such
   ways and means, as he hath ordained it shall be done. Things casual to
   us are counsels to him. What was chance to others is the Lord to Job,
   chap. i. 21. Therefore not uncertain chance is intended, but such as is
   ruled and governed by God, who disposeth of all occasions and events
   according to his own good pleasure, either in escaping out of danger,
   or obtaining victory, or being supplied with necessaries, or growing
   rich, or received into favour; it is all as God will order it. The
   swift, the wise, the strong, though they are best prepared, disposed,
   and do most intend their business, yet the event is in God's hand, who
   disposeth it according to His own will.

   Before we draw the doctrine from hence, we shall remove the false
   inferences and deductions that some make.

   1. Some think these words to be spoken in the person of the epicure or
   atheist, whom Solomon introduceth as reasoning against divine
   providence; but it agreeth not with the preface, I returned, and saw
   under the sun;' which is usually prefixed before his observations about
   the vanity and vexation that ariseth from mere worldly things.

   2. This text must be vindicated from them who set up an idol of the
   heathens' blind fortune, as if all things were carried by uncertain
   chance. No; it is occurrence (as before); and though it be chance to
   men, it is providence to God, the universal and first agent, who
   worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.' It is not
   chance to him, for he never misseth of his end, for his knowledge is
   infallible and his power insuperable.

   3. From those who reject the use of means, and all operations,
   dispositions, and preparations of second causes, as if they moved not,
   and God did not act or move by them. No; this a false deduction and
   inference both in naturals and spirituals.

   [1.] In naturals, for God worketh by means, and by means prepared:
   Hosea ii. 21, 22, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the
   earth,' &c. There is a train of causes governed and influenced by God.
   The second causes have their operation, but they are under the
   government of the first, who worketh by them, and also suspendeth their
   operations at his pleasure. There are two extremes: one of Durandus,
   that God giveth second causes only power to work of themselves, and
   doth only continue this power to them, but not work with them. But this
   is false; for all things depend on God, not only for their being, but
   working: Acts xvii. 28, In him we live, move, and have our being,' The
   other is, that the creature hath no operation at all, that the first
   cause doth only work ad presentiam creaturae, by the presence of the
   second. But this is also against the wisdom of God; for if the second
   causes did no way concur to the producing of their effects, then they
   are made in vain, and used for such an end in vain.

   [2.] Nor in spirituals: Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your salvation with
   fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and
   to do of his own good pleasure,' God's working is an engagement to us
   to wait upon him in the use of means, that we may meet with God in his
   way, and God may meet with us in our way. In his way; for God hath
   appointed certain duties to convey and apply his grace to us; we are to
   lie at the pool till the waters be stirred, to continue our attendance
   till God giveth his grace, Mark iv. 24. In our way; for God influenceth
   all things according to their natural inclination. God, that
   enlighteneth with and by the sun, burneth with and by the fire,
   reasoneth with and by man, acts necessarily with necessary causes, and
   freely with free causes. He doth not oppress the liberty of the
   creature, but preserveth the nature and interest of his own workman
   ship: Hosea xi. 4, I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of
   love.' He draweth by propounding reasons, which we consider, and so
   betake ourselves to a godly life. In short, we must do what we can,
   otherwise we are wanting to ourselves; but we must not depend upon our
   own counsel, wisdom, and strength, for the event is not always to the
   swift, strong, and wise.

   The true observation contained in these words is this:--

   That many endeavours of the creature are often frustrated of their end
   when there is greatest probability of success.

   Here Solomon representeth men:--

   1. Under several accomplishments of swift, wise, strong.

   2. As addressing themselves to some effect to obtain success.

   3. As in the issue disappointed. None of these accomplishments alone do
   give the event intended and hoped for, nor doth it depend absolutely
   and infallibly upon them.

   4. That all things intended, desired, expected by us, depend upon time
   and chance, namely, as they depend upon God's providence, as and when
   God will order and determine the time and opportunity, the success and
   event.

   Therefore from the whole it appears, that instruments most fitted and
   furnished, and most diligent in their way, are frustrated of the event
   which they so earnestly intended and hoped for.

REASONS.

   I. The best instruments fail out of their ignorance, oblivion, and
   inadvertency, from which man cannot altogether free himself in this
   life, not only in matters spiritual, but secular, whether economical in
   the disposing of ourselves and relations, or family interests and
   concernments. Wise men have their errors: James iii. 2, In many things
   we offend all of us.' This ignorance showeth itself sometimes in a
   mistake of instruments whose hearts we know not; or if we know them for
   the present, we are not sure of futurity, how they may change or be
   alienated and drawn off from us. Sometimes about time and opportunity,
   for the beginning, setting on foot, or carrying on any good works: Man
   knoweth not his time.' Sometimes in the manner of doing there is some
   error; for some things we know speculatively we do not know
   practically, and what we know in the general is to be done we do not
   always know in particular cases, but are blinded by our affections;
   what we know habitually we do not know actually, we do not consider of
   it for the time. In short, no man knoweth all the secrets and circuits
   of human affairs. God only is omnipotent and omniscient, hath all
   creatures in his power, and can foresee all events. But it is much for
   us to understand our duty, we cannot know events, for things are
   carried strangely beyond men's expectation, and their likeliest
   projects crossed.

   II. Because if we have sufficient knowledge, yet God can easily put
   some impediment from within or without to hinder the use of our wisdom,
   power, and knowledge.

   1. Within. He can blast our excellencies in an instant, or obstruct the
   use of it for the time. As though he did not destroy the property of
   the fire, yet he suspended the burning, when the three children were in
   the furnace. So of a sudden can he blast our strength: Ps. xvi. 5, 6,
   The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep; none of the
   men of might have found their hands; at thy rebuke the chariot and
   horses are cast into a dead sleep.' Whatsoever strength, courage, wit,
   or any other point of perfection any man hath, God, who gave it, can
   take it away when he pleaseth, or suspend the use of it. All this God
   can do with a rebuke, with a word of his mouth. Now, as the strong
   cannot find their hands, so the wise cannot find their hearts: Job v.
   14, They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as
   in the night.' Who were these? The wise and the crafty, whom he
   speaketh of in the foregoing verses. In the clearest cases they are to
   seek, and so their well-contrived plots come to nothing. There is a
   blast and plague upon their judgments, so that they do involve and
   confound themselves; and what by self-conceit and froward self-will,
   they drive on their designs so precipitantly and furiously that they
   must needs miscarry. They do not seem to have the judgment of ordinary
   men. Thus though men be endowed with good gifts and qualities, both of
   wisdom and strength, God can easily take away their power and will to
   use them.

   2. From without. By casting in some casual event, which we foresaw not,
   and could not think of. Man cannot foresee all the wheels which move in
   a business; if he did, he is not able to turn them; so that, besides
   taking away his wisdom, courage, and strength, when the work is to be
   done, God puts some impediment in his way which was unexpected. There
   are certain sudden accidents which none can fore see and prevent, any
   of them able to turn the enterprise another way. The most casual
   fortuitous things are ordered by God, for the great ends of his
   providence. As for instance, Haman travailed with a design to cut off
   all the people of the Jews, but his chief spite was against Mordecai.
   Now by chance the king could not sleep that night, and calleth for the
   book of memorials, Esth. vi. 1, and found the discovery of a treason by
   Mordecai there recorded, which spoiled all the deep plots of Haman
   against the Jews. Ahab intended to avenge himself upon Micaiah, and to
   escape in the battle, changed his robes and royal apparel, and
   counselled Jehoshaphat to put on his: and a man drew a bow at a
   venture,' 1 Kings xxii. 34. God directed the arrow to the heart of the
   king of Israel. Jehoshaphat escapeth, and he is slain. So that notable
   instance, the sunshine upon the water, 2 Kings iii. 2224. When the
   Moabites came to distress Jehoshaphat, when they cried Moab to the
   spoil,' it was indeed Moab to a sore destruction.'

   Now these, and many such like instances, teach us that the most casual
   and fortuitous things do certainly and infallibly fall out by God's
   providence and heavenly government. And again, that there is some
   occurrence which providence casteth in by the way to disappoint the
   most likely means; and whatever gifts and qualities men are endowed
   withal, yet events are not in their power, but depend on the free
   concurrence of God. I speak nothing now of the influence of angels upon
   human affairs, whom God maketh use of in the government of the world.

   III. The most able instruments do often provoke God to disappoint them,
   whilst their abilities of counsel and strength are a means of hardening
   their hearts in carnal confidence, and often engage in business that
   proves mischievous to them; I say, in the most lawful businesses they
   provoke God to disappoint them, because they under take them without
   God; but too often being unrenewed and unsanctified, their wit and
   power is used against God.

   1. It is a great crime to go about any business without God: Prov. iii.
   5, 6, Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own
   understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.' When our wisdom and strength is set up as an idol or image of
   jealousy, God is obliged to blast it. Therefore they that make their
   bosom their oracle, their wit their counsellor, they seldom carve out
   to themselves a good portion. In all serious business we must ask his
   leave, counsel, blessing.

   2. But many times men of great abilities, being unsanctified, employ
   them against God. They are ordinarily the devil's greatest agents and
   factors for his kingdom. In seducing our first parents he made use of
   the serpent, which was more subtle than any beast of the field,' Gen.
   iii. 1. Now these make God their opposite party that engage in any such
   enterprise upon the confidence of their wisdom and strength, and then
   they are snared by the work of their own hands,' Ps. ix. 16. God
   delighteth to be seen to put rubs and stumbling-blocks in their way,
   that they may fall by some miserable disappointment, and their craft
   and power may turn to their own ruin.

   IV. To say and do, or to make a thing to be, is the act and name of
   Jehovah, which glory he will not communicate to any other: Lam. iii.
   37, Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
   commandeth it not?' that is, who is able to bring about what he
   speaketh and purposeth, unless God permit and give way thereunto?
   Therefore, whatever preparation of means or likelihoods there are, we
   must not be too confident of future events. We cannot bring them to
   pass by our own power, and God doth not always work by likely means; he
   hides events from men: Isa. xlviii. 7, Lest thou shouldst say, I knew
   them.' Now the event could not be hidden if the Lord went on in a
   constant course, giving the race to the swift, &c. God carrieth on his
   providence so as to leave no footsteps behind him. He goeth not one way
   so often as to make a path of it, that men may see the plain tendency
   thereof.

   The uses follow.

   It teaches us:--

   I. The nothingness of the creature, and the all-sufficiency of God.
   That is a great lesson indeed, and mightily useful to us throughout the
   whole spiritual life.

   First, It is a notion which the scripture much delighteth in, to
   represent God as all and the creature as nothing. At first, when Moses
   inquired God's distinctive name, God giveth him no other but I am:
   Exod. iii. 14, And God said unto Moses, I am that I am; and I am hath
   sent me unto you.' What thing is there under the cope of heaven that
   cannot say I am that I am'? The least worm hath its own being; but
   this, as God's distinctive name, implieth that he encloseth all being
   within himself. Secondly, The creature is nothing: Isa. xl. 17, All
   nations before him are nothing; they are accounted less than nothing,
   and vanity;' Dan. iv. 35, The inhabitants of the world are reputed
   before him as nothing.' All created beings must vanish out of our sight
   when we think of God.

   But how are the creatures nothing, which faith teaches us? and how
   something, which sense teacheth us? Something they are unquestionably
   in respect of that derived and dependent being which they have from
   God. We must not establish the Pyrrhonian conceit that the whole world
   is but a fantasy, indeed nothing, and our life but a dream, or
   sceptically to look upon the being and modes of all things as
   uncertain. No; nor to imagine that sense is so far fallible that a man
   of sound sense and understanding may not be sure of the objects
   conveniently presented to his sense. Certainly the sceptics need to be
   scourged as fools till they feel themselves something. But yet it is of
   high importance in the work of godliness to see the creature nothing.
   It is so:--

   1. By way of comparison with God.

   2. By way of exclusion of God.

   3. By way of opposition to God.

   1. By way of comparison with God. So God's name only is I am, and then
   there is none besides him. If the creatures be compared among
   themselves, some are good, strong, wise, others not; but they are all
   nothing in comparison of God. Though there be a difference between the
   stars in the night, some are brighter and some are darker, some of the
   first magnitude, second, third, &c., yet in the daytime they are all
   alike inconspicuous, all are darkened by the sun's glory. When we
   compare the creatures one with another, we shall find different degrees
   of perfection and excellency; but by the glorious brightness of the
   Father of lights all these inferior lights are obscured and their
   differences unobserved. God saith somewhere, I am, and there is none
   else; I am alone. I lift my hand to heaven, and swear, I live for
   ever.' It is counted an usurpation of divine honour for the creature to
   say I am: Isa. xlvii. 8, Babylon said in her heart, I am! So Nineveh:
   Zeph. ii. 15, This is the rejoicing city, that dwelt carelessly, that
   said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me;' Isa. xlvii. 10,
   Thy wisdom and understanding hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in
   thy heart I am, and there is none besides me.' For us to reckon upon
   our wisdom, strength, or goodness, is a derogation from God. God in
   scripture is represented as only wise, only strong, and only good, Job
   ix. 19, 1 Tim. i. 17, Mat. xix. 17. The creature hath but the shadow of
   these things. As it is but a borrowed kind of speech to call a picture
   or a statue a man--this is Caesar, this is Alexander--because of the
   likeness and representation, so the creatures are but a resemblance
   when we call them wise, strong, good. To this head may be referred
   those expressions, the true light,' John i. 9, the true vine,' John xv.
   1. These terms originally agree to God, and but in a borrowed sense to
   the creature.

   2. By way of exclusion of God. As the sunbeam is nothing when the sun
   withdraweth, or the sound is nothing when the musician taketh away his
   mouth and breath from the pipe and instrument: Ps. civ. 29, 30, Thou
   sendest forth thy Spirit, and they are created; thou takest away thy
   breath, and they die.' The creature in comparison with God is in
   reckoning nothing; but in exclusion of God it is in reality nothing;
   because all their life, wisdom, strength, and the acting of it is but
   borrowed and derived from God, and held only at God's pleasure.
   Naturally and spiritually it is true. If any of us say, I am, we must
   add with Paul, By the grace of God I am that I am,' 1 Cor. xv. 10. And
   again, I live, yet not I, but Christ,' Gal. ii. 20. If God withdraw his
   providential influence and supportation, we vanish into nothing: Job
   vii. 8, Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not;' meaning that God,
   fastening his eye upon him in anger, would look him into nothing.

   3. In way of opposition to God, either to his cause and interest in the
   world: Isa. xli. 11, Behold, all that are incensed against thee shall
   be as nothing.' The creature beareth a big bulk in the eye of sense,
   seemeth not only as something, but as all things; and as long as a man
   looketh to what is visible, we have no hope and comfort to fasten upon.
   But what are the swift, the wise, the strong to God, or against his
   providence, when God is angry for sin, and we use ordinary means to
   avoid the danger, and do not reconcile ourselves to him, and take up
   the controversy between him and us? Alas! human endeavours can avail
   nothing against his wrath. Those probable means, which have prevailed
   at other times, will prove a mere nothing; be we never so strong and
   wise, and use never so many politic means to avert the judgment: Amos
   vi. 13, Ye rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken
   to ourselves horns by our own strength?' They gloried in this, that
   their strength was renewed and increased, and so hoped to elude the
   threatened judgment, and to drive away any enemy that might invade
   them. They glory in a thing of nought,' saith the prophet. Alas! what
   are armies, troops, confederacies, councils? Things of nought, when God
   will blow upon them; all things on this side of God are of nought, and
   vain to be gloried in, when our sins are come to a height, and
   judgments are threatened and near.

   Secondly, I will prove to you, that the true apprehension of this is
   mightily useful to us throughout the whole spiritual life; for no one
   thing keepeth the creature upright so much as to see all in God, and
   nothing in the creature. This establisheth our dependence on God's
   promises in the most difficult cases; as Rom. iv. 17, 18, What made
   Abraham to believe in hope against hope,' and give God so much credit
   and glory as he did? By his faith he believed in him that quickeneth
   the dead, and calleth those things that are not as though they were.'
   Again, there is nothing that doth so encourage us in the difficult
   services which God calleth us unto, as to remember God is all, and the
   creature is nothing. As when the apostles went to preach the gospel
   first at Jerusalem, in the very face of opposition, whose interest led
   them to oppose it. When among the Gentiles, possessed of a religion
   entailed upon them by the tradition of many ages, and for which they
   were zealous, the devil stirring up the hatred of many furious spirits
   against them. The doctrine was novel, and did not court the senses, but
   persuaded men to row against the stream of flesh and blood, slighted by
   the people, disputed against by their wise men, persecuted by the
   powers that then were, had no temporal interest to back it; and this to
   be promoted in the face of the learned world, by a few poor fisher men,
   when all civil disciplines were then in their akme` and height. What
   encouraged them to this? The apostle telleth you, 1 Cor. i. 26-28, That
   though they had not many mighty, not many noble,' to own them; yet God
   had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and
   the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty,
   and the things that are not to bring to nought the things that are.' In
   short, that though magistracy and populacy were against them, the
   creature is as nothing, God all in all. Again, to depend on God's
   providence in the midst of losses, wants, straits:. 2 Cor. vi. 10, As
   having nothing, yet possessing all things.' Again, if we have a due
   sense of God's being, the tempting baits of the world would scarce be
   seen; the riches, honours, and pleasures of the world would be
   forgotten, as if they were not: Prov. xxiii. 5, Wilt thou set thine
   heart upon that which is not?' It is as if it were not, if God will
   blast them, if God will not work by them. Again, to look for a blessing
   upon all the means: 1 Cor. iii. 7, For neither is he that planteth
   anything, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.' The
   best and wisest ministers can do nothing, either to plant or water, to
   convert or build up, unless God give the blessing, and set in with
   their labours. Again, to keep us humble in the highest enjoyments: 2
   Cor. xi. 5, In nothing I come behind the chiefest apostles, though I am
   nothing;' all is but a borrowed excellency. Thus you see it hath an
   influence upon our uprightness and sincere dealing, from first to last,
   to look off from the creature to God alone.

   Thirdly, I shall show you that this is the intent of this lesson which
   is given us in this place. For wherefore is the race denied to the
   swift, and the battle to the strong, and riches to men of
   understanding, but to show us that the creature doth not do all, yea,
   that it is nothing if you exclude God? Why doth the Holy Ghost direct
   us to this meditation, but to carry up our thoughts to the overruling
   power of the highest cause and agent, disposing of time and chance,
   that second causes may be seen to depend upon him both in being and
   operation? and that we should not abuse our talents, by confiding in
   them without God, or turning and using them against God, either to
   oppose his interest, or defeat his judgments? So that I might rest
   here. But the meanest capacities will require more explicit
   application.

   II. To teach us in this lottery of human affaire to look after surer
   comforts. This is the whole drift of this book; for Solomon, in his
   critical search and observation of all things done under the sun,
   aimeth at this, to direct our hearts to blessings which are more stable
   and sure. God would leave these things at uncertainty, that our hearts
   might not too much be set upon them, that we might not pursue after
   favour, riches, and credit, as the best things. If all things here did
   run in one certain tenor, men, that are mightily wrought upon by sense,
   would look no higher; but there is a nobler pursuit, a better happiness
   to be found elsewhere. The race is not always to the swift; but in the
   spiritual race, we run not as uncertain,' 1 Cor. ix. 26. There the
   crown is sure, if we keep running and faint not; here the battle is not
   always to the strong, and he that putteth on his harness must not boast
   as he that putteth it off.' But if you fight the good fight of faith,'
   the God of peace will tread Satan under your feet shortly,' Rom. xvi.
   20. Here bread is not to the wise; many persons of understanding labour
   and toil all their days for the meat that perishes, and at length can
   hardly get it. But if you labour for the meat that perisheth not, the
   Son of man will give it you,' John vi. 27. In spiritual and heavenly
   things, choose and have, seek and have, labour and have; but it is not
   so in worldly things; there many times we have but our pains for our
   travail Again, nor riches to men of understanding. Fools go away with
   the world, and we need not envy them if we be wise to salvation: Thou
   fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; so is he that
   heapeth up riches to himself, and is not rich towards God,' Luke xii.
   20, 21. Earthly things cannot make a man truly rich; the true riches
   are the heavenly treasure, the graces of the spirit, to be rich in
   faith,' James ii. 6; Fruitful in good works,' 1 Tim. vi. 18, 19. He
   that valueth an estate more by the possession than by the use, is a
   spiritual fool, and will at length be thrown into hell for his perverse
   choice. No matter if you want the riches of this world, so you be rich
   towards God. Christ gave his Spirit to the best disciples, but his
   purse to Judas, who was a thief and a robber. Once more, nor favour to
   men of skill. The favour of men, princes or people, is a very uncertain
   thing, and the best experienced in affairs do not always light on it;
   but if we have the favour of God, this breedeth solid joy, Ps. iv. 7.
   Gladness is sent into the heart when God smileth, though the world
   frowneth. These spiritual and eternal blessings are dispensed by a sure
   covenant, the others are promiscuously given by an uncertain
   providence.

   III. What need there is God should be seen and sought unto in all our
   designs and resolutions about the disposal of ourselves and ours.

   1. What will the use of means and second causes do without God? When we
   have prepared best, and consulted best, the intentions we travail with
   may miscarry, for the event is wholly in God's hands: Prov. xvi. 1, The
   preparations of the heart are from man, but the answer of the tongue is
   from the Lord.' Man propoundeth, intendeth, purposeth; but the success
   cometh from God.

   2. When we have done our duty, and used such good means as God
   affordeth, then we may quietly refer the success to God, in whose hands
   are all the ways of the children of men, and upon whose good pleasure
   the issues of all things depend, Prov. xvi. 13.

   IV. The wisest and best of men must not expect always to be happy, but
   must prepare themselves for sinister chances; for the words are brought
   in upon this occasion of rejoicing in our comforts. In an uncertain
   world we must always reserve a liberty of full and free submission to
   God's providence, if the event should not answer expectation; for the
   race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.' We must
   not be too confident of future worldly events, for in these things God,
   by whose providence all things are governed, would leave us to
   uncertainty. Alas! many times we mistake and miss of fit opportunities,
   and then the best preparations and sufficiencies will be lost. My times
   are in thy hand,' saith David, Ps. xxxi. 15. And sometimes God
   interposeth, and will be glorified by us in an afflicted condition.
   Therefore you must reserve a liberty to God, to order and govern you
   according to his own pleasure, as to success in your callings, comfort
   in your relations, favour with men in your employments. God may make
   every relation a door to let in affliction. You should often consider
   the sovereignty of God, the uncertainty of your own lives, the
   mutability of all worldly things. You speak arrogantly when you presume
   of success, and take more upon you than you are able to perform: 1 Sam.
   ii. 3, Talk no more exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of
   your mouth;' that is, presumptuous conceits of absolute success. And
   the apostle James, chap. iv. 13, 14, &c., Go to now, ye that say,
   To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a
   year, and buy and sell, and get gain. Your life is a vapour; and ye
   ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. Now
   ye rejoice in your boastings, all such rejoicing is evil.' There are
   certain times when God is resolved to proceed with his people in a
   judiciary way, and then all means we can use will not keep off the
   stroke: Amos ii. 14-16, Therefore the flight shall perish from the
   swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, nor the mighty
   deliver himself; neither shall he stand that handleth the bow, nor he
   that is swift of foot deliver himself, nor he that rideth the horse. He
   that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away in that day, saith
   the Lord.' No means, though never so probable, will avail us in a time
   of judgments; neither speed of horse or foot, neither strength of body,
   nor courage of mind, nor provision of armour, nor skill to use it; but
   the judgments shall reach all they aim at. Then it is plainly
   fulfilled, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
   strong,' &c.

   V. Take heed of carnal confidence, or depending upon the sufficiency of
   any means, though never so likely to produce their effect. Partly
   because God delighteth to cross men in their carnal confidences, he
   blasteth those sufficiencies which we depend upon and rejoice in apart
   from himself, to maintain his own right. Success is his: The battle is
   the Lord's,' 1 Sam. xvii. 47. He blasts men in the things they boast
   of. Asahel's swiftness was his ruin; so was Ahithophel's policy and
   Absolom's hair. God saith to Babylon, thy understanding hath undone
   thee. Men often by their wit bring themselves into mischief, yea, into
   hell.

   VI. To keep humble men of the best abilities and sufficiencies for any
   work.

   1. Before the event; for many times they meet with more disappointments
   than those that want them, and their best designs miscarry when meaner
   persons are carried through their difficulties with less ado.

   2. After the event we must look above second causes, not attribute
   anything to our own strength or gifts, but to God's assistance and
   blessing on our labours. Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor
   the strong man glory in his might,' &c., Jer. ix. 23. So Deut. viii.
   17, 18, Say not in thy heart, My power, and the might of my hand, hath
   gotten me this wealth. Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for he it
   is that giveth thee power to get wealth.' Let us not sacrifice to our
   own net.' The battle is not to the strong, nor bread to the wise.' It
   is God's, and he will not be robbed of his glory. And as we should
   carry it humbly towards God, so also to men, not despising them of mean
   gifts. Many times God giveth them more success in the ministry, in
   ordinary callings, in favour and preferments in the world, or esteem in
   the eyes of the people. It is God only makes the difference, and what
   thou hast above others thou hast it from God, and for God; not to lift
   up thyself, but to exalt God; therefore give thanks, and do not contemn
   others.

   VII. To prevent the discouragement of those that want gifts, or parts,
   or means. Suppose their adversaries be mighty: It is nothing with God
   to help with many, or them that have no power,' 2 Chron. xiv. 11. The
   less in the creature the more in God: 2 Cor. xii. 9, His power is
   perfected in our weakness,' God many times passeth over the strong,
   wise, and understanding, and gets himself most glory in protecting the
   weak, and providing for them.

   The issue of all is this: Let us bear all things befalling us from the
   wise hand and providence of the Lord, and encourage ourselves in his
   all-sufficiency in all straits and difficulties.

SERMON XV.

   And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the
   Lord be done.--Acts XXI. 14.

   THE history that concerns this passage begins at the 8th verse. In the
   whole you may take notice:--

   I. Of the occasion.

   II. Of the carriage of the saints upon it.

   I. In the occasion I observe:--

   1. That Paul was now at Cesarea, in Philip's house, ver. 8. Philip was
   one of those that were scattered and driven out of his dwelling by
   Paul's persecution, Acts viii. 4, 5; and now he received him into his
   own house. Philip, that was injured by Paul a persecutor, is easily
   reconciled with Paul a convert. It is an ill office to rake in the
   filth which God hath covered, and it argueth some envy at the divine
   grace to upbraid men with sins committed before conversion. Former
   miscarriages and injuries should be forgotten. If Christ hath taken
   them into his bosom, we should not be strange to them.

   2. There Agabus comes to him and prophesieth of Paul's bonds at
   Jerusalem. Agabus was a prophet, but by what appears of him in
   scripture, ever a prophet of evil tidings: he foretold a famine, Acts
   xi. 28, and now Paul's bonds. God will be glorified by all manner of
   tempers and dispositions. Some, like Agabus, come always with a sad
   message in their mouths; and yet these have their use. Even those that
   give warning of judgments to come should be accepted, as well as those
   that bring us hopes of mercy and deliverance. It was an unjust
   exception of the king of Israel against Micaiah, 1 Kings xxii. 8, I
   hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.' They
   that do evil do not love to hear of evil; and yet that may be true
   which is not pleasing.

   3. Agabus useth a sign, ver. 11; he goes and binds himself, and showeth
   thus it should be done with Paul at Jerusalem. This was usual with the
   prophets; as Isaiah went naked and barefoot to show what should be
   their usage under the king of Assyria, Isa. xx. 2, 3. Ezekiel was to
   pack up his stuff and remove, to signify what should be the lot of the
   people, Ezek. xii. 3-5; that God might teach his people by visible
   signs, as well as by word of mouth, and what was received by both
   senses (sight and hearing) might make a deeper impression upon their
   souls; therefore he hath instituted sacraments. As kings delight to
   have their royal deeds not only recorded in chronicles, but to have
   some monuments set up as a sign which may be perpetuated in future
   ages, so the Lord Jesus, having vanquished death, hell, the grave, the
   devil, and sin, not only has it recorded in his word, but would give us
   signs and monuments, that we might continually remember both the
   victory and the comfort we have by Christ.

   But what needs Paul so often to be warned of his bonds? He had been
   told before, Acts xx. 22, 23, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem,
   not knowing the things that shall befal me there, save that the Holy
   Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide
   me.' And then again, in this chapter, Acts xxi. 4, There were some
   disciples which said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go
   up to Jerusalem.' How shall we reconcile these expressions? They said
   through the Spirit that Paul should not go up to Jerusalem;' and yet
   Paul was bound in the spirit to go to Jerusalem.' In this latter place
   we must distinguish between the prediction of troubles and the counsel
   of safety. The prediction of troubles; so they said through the Spirit
   that it would be dangerous for Paul to go to Jerusalem, but they
   dissuaded him from going to Jerusalem out of their own private love and
   affection to him; so that Paul was warned again and again.

   Quest. But why was he warned so often?

   Ans. That he might be thoroughly prepared. God doth not love to take
   his children unprovided. Paul was not surprised, but had warning upon
   warning of his present danger. If a sudden and unexpected flood of
   miseries break in upon us, it is not because we want warning, but
   because we will not take warning. When we are well at ease, we will not
   think of death and the cross; and therefore, if we be unprovided, we
   may thank our own security.

   II. The carriage of the saints upon this occasion. And there we may
   take notice of four things:--

   1. The entire affection of the disciples to Paul, who had done them
   good: they besought him, &c.

   2. Paul's entire affection to God: yet he would not be persuaded.

   3. Their discretion: when he would not be persuaded, they ceased.

   4. The ground of their discretion, their piety: they said, The will of
   the Lord be done.

   1. Their entire affection to Paul: Both, we and they of that place be
   sought him that he would not go up to Jerusalem,' ver. 12. This
   entreaty did not proceed from self-love, for they were resolved to go
   with him, ver. 15, but zeal for God's glory. The lives and liberties of
   those that are eminent instruments of God's glory are very dear and
   precious to God's faithful people. Paul declares of Aquila and
   Priscilla, Rom. xvi. 4, For my life laid they down their own necks;'
   and Acts xix. 31, His friends desired him that he would not adventure
   into the theatre.' They have them in singular love for their worth's
   sake, and therefore, when they are in danger they weep sore, Acts xx.
   37; and when they are dead they make great lamentation: Devout men
   carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him,'
   Acts viii. 2. As the Israelites said to David, 2 Sam. xxi. 17, Thou
   shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light
   of Israel;' that is, lest the glory and splendour of the nation perish
   with thee. The loss of a good magistrate is a great loss, and such
   instruments are not easily had again when once lost.

   But was this well done to persuade him?

   Yes; for though the prophet had foretold what Paul should suffer, yet
   we know of no command they had to the contrary. All desires against
   God's secret will are not unlawful, when we afterwards submit to his
   revealed will: 1 Kings viii. 18, And the Lord said to David my father,
   Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou
   didst well that it was in thy heart.' And yet that was against God's
   secret will; it was in his heart to build God's house, and it was no
   sin, for there was no command to the contrary. So here they were to
   desire the preservation of so precious an instrument as Paul was; yet
   Satan might have a hand in it, from their persuasion to weaken his
   resolution. Satan often laboureth to take us off from our duty by the
   persuasion of our loving friends, who mean as well in what they say to
   us. When Christ had told of his sufferings at Jerusalem, Peter said, Be
   it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee.' Our Saviour
   replied, Get thee behind me, Satan,' Mat. xvi. 22, 23. Who would have
   thought that Christ's disciple should have been Satan's instrument, and
   then when speaking in love to his master? Therefore we must not measure
   their counsel by their good meaning, but by God's word, and be deaf to
   all relations, that we may discharge our duty to God. See Deut. xiii.
   6, 7. In our affections to eminent instruments to God's glory, there
   may be much of carnal infirmity.

   2. Here was Paul's firm resolution: He would not be persuaded.'

   Did Paul do well in this? How doth this agree with that character of
   heavenly wisdom that it is easy to be entreated?' James iii. 17.

   I answer--In our duty it is praiseworthy to be easy to be entreated,
   but not from our duty. Paul went bound in the spirit to Jerusalem. He
   knew the will of God, and therefore though they did even break his
   heart, they could not break his purpose. No persuasions of friends, no
   apprehensions of danger, should turn us out of the way wherein God
   commands us to walk. No persuasion. So Christ, when he was desired to
   avoid suffering, which was the end of his coming into the world,
   rejected the motion. It is notable, the Lord Jesus with the same
   indignation rebuketh Peter dissuading him from suffering, as he did the
   devil tempting him to idolatry. See Mat. xvi. 23, compared with Mat.
   iv. 10. No dangers. Here were dangers threatened. Agabus foretold
   bonds, the Spirit foretold bonds, others told him of bonds, yet Paul
   was not persuaded. So when the king of Babylon threatened the three
   children, they resolutely answered, Dan. iii. 18, Our God, whom we
   serve, is able to deliver us; but if not, be it known unto thee, O
   king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship thy golden image.'
   And therefore Paul rebukes them, for they were weeping when they saw
   his resolution: What! mean ye to break my heart? For I am not only
   ready to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem for the name of Christ' A
   little to clear the expression by the way.

   Is it not a good thing to have a broken heart? And are not they that
   further it to be commended rather than reproved?

   I answer--There is a twofold heart--a heart that is hard against God,
   and soft for God; and a heart that is hard for God, and soft against
   God. The first, when it is bold in sinning, but fearful and soft in
   troubles. As Deut. xx. 8, The fearful and the soft-hearted.' But now
   the heart which is hard for God, and soft against God, is the heart
   which is a coward in sin; but like a lion, undaunted in all manner of
   sufferings. They will trust in God though he kill them, and can
   confront the greatest dangers, and yet tremble at the least offence
   against God, and dare not do it. Now saith Paul, You break my heart;
   that is, even weaken my courage, and take me off from my purpose.

   3. Observe their discretion, that when he would not be persuaded, they
   ceased.' Either Paul told them what intimation he had from God. or else
   they thought so wise a man as Paul would not thrust himself upon danger
   without a warrant. It is the disposition of humble spirits not to be
   peremptory of their own conceits, but to submit to those that are wiser
   than themselves. Mat. iii. 15, John would not at first admit Christ to
   his baptism, out of reverence to him, and humility. But saith Christ,
   Suffer it to be so now.' When he was informed of Christ's mind, then he
   suffered him. So those that were so zealous for inclosing of the common
   salvation, When they heard that God had granted repentance unto life to
   the Gentiles, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then
   hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life,' Acts xi.
   18. It showeth we should not be too stiff in our private conceits and
   humours, when a plain evidence appeareth to the contrary,--a lesson
   that men have great need to learn.

   4. Their piety, the ground of their discretion: The will of the Lord be
   done.' The scripture speaks:--

   [1.] Of God's determining and decreeing will: Eph. i. 11, He doth all
   things according to the counsel of his will.'

   [2.] Of his approving or liking will: Rom. xii. 2, That ye may prove
   what is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.'

   The text speaks not of his commanded, but of his intended will; not of
   his will to be done by us, but of his will to be done upon us. God's
   intended will is either--(1.) Secret, before the decree bring forth the
   issue and event; (2.) or else declared by the event. While it is
   secret, we pray for the accomplishment of it: Jer. xxix. 11, I know the
   thoughts that I think towards you.' &c. And we conceive all our desires
   with submission to it. But now we speak of his will revealed and
   declared in his providence. There is a submission required to both.

   1. To God's intended will, while it is yet kept secret.

   That in every business we should ask his leave and blessing. It is a
   piece of religious manners to begin with God.

   [1.] His leave, as Judges i. 1: Shall I go up and fight against the
   Canaanites, or shall I not?' And thus Jehoshaphat would inquire of the
   prophet, Shall I go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prevail?' The honest
   heathens had this principle, A Jove principium, that every action was
   to be begun with God.

   Balaam had a conscience this way, he would inquire of God before he
   would proceed either to curse or bless. By this means we acknowledge
   God, our dependence upon him, and his dominion over us. It is robbery
   to use any goods without the owner's leave. We and all ours are the
   goods of God. God hath such a dominion over us as a man hath over his
   goods; not only a dominion of jurisdiction, as governor in law, but a
   dominion of propriety. Therefore in journeys, in removing of our
   dwelling, in disposal of our children, God must not be left out, but be
   treated with in the first place.

   [2.] His blessing. When the event is uncertain, beg the Lord's
   concurrence, and the blessing of his providence: Jer. x. 23, O Lord, I
   know the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to
   direct his steps.' Man cannot manage his own actions with any comfort
   or success; therefore we must beg it of God, whose will doth all in the
   case. So Gen. xxiv. 12, And he said, Lord God of my master Abraham, I
   pray thee send me good speed this day.' We are to desire all may speed
   while we are in God's way. It is a vain thing to promise ourselves
   great matters without the leave and blessing of providence; for our
   lives and actions, and all which concern us, are in God's hands.

   2. We must refer the event to his determination. This is a great part
   of trust in God, and of quietness of mind, when we are so persuaded of
   the Lord's goodness, wisdom, and power that we leave the event to him,
   and refer it that he shall cast it as he pleaseth, being so sensible of
   the power of his providence, and so confident of the goodness of his
   conduct. Submitting all things to God's will after the event is
   patience, and submitting all things to God's will before the event is a
   notable piece of faith. When I trust God absolutely, let him do with me
   what he pleaseth; but I know he is a good God, and he will do nothing
   but what is good, and what is for the best. We are obliged in all
   things we design to be subordinate to God's will, and to accept of it:
   Rom. i. 10, Making request, if by any means now at length I might have
   a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you; James iv. 15,
   We ought to say, If the Lord will;' 1 Cor. iv. 19, But I will come to
   you shortly, if the Lord will.' So in many other places. This was a
   truth evident to the heathens. Plato brings in Alcibiades asking
   Socrates how he should speak of future events, and in what manner he
   should express himself; and Socrates answers, Even as God will. To use
   such an express reservation in all our undertakings is profitable to
   beget reverence in ourselves, and to instruct others. Thus far the
   light of nature teacheth men. I confess it is not absolutely necessary
   in all cases to express ourselves so, but this disposition should be in
   our minds: 1 Cor. xi. 34, And the rest will I set in order when I
   come.' He doth not say there, If God will,' but yet he reserves that. 1
   speak this as the lowest thing, that we be not too confident of events,
   but refer them to the Lord's will. But a child of God goeth higher: he
   knows he hath a good God, a heavenly Father, which guides all things in
   wisdom, power, and goodness. And the event may be against his desires,
   appetites, conceits, fancies, but he knows God will govern and do
   better for him than his own choices. He trusts all to God.

   3. Our purposes and desires must be so moderated that we may be
   forearmed for all events: 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26, If I shall find favour in
   the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and show me both it and
   his habitation: but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; let him
   do with me as seemeth good unto him.' Such a holy indifferency should
   there be upon our spirits, that we should be like a die in the hand of
   Providence, to be cast high or low according as it falls. When we are
   over-earnest for temporal blessings, we do but make a scourge, a snare,
   and a rod many times to ourselves. For when God's will is declared to
   the contrary, this fills us with bitter sorrow; and obstinate desires
   pettishly solicited put us upon great vexation and disappointment, and
   that layeth us open to atheism, and distrust of God, the conduct of his
   providence, and the promises of the invisible world. Therefore, until
   God hath declared his pleasure, there must be such moderation as to be
   prepared for all events.

   4. When the event depends upon a duty, we must do the duty, and refer
   the event to God: 1 Cor. ix. 16, Necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
   me, if I preach not the gospel! It is a base principle to say we must
   be sure of success before we will engage for God. No; when there is an
   apparent duty we must do our duty, and trust God with the event.

   5. In a dubious case observe the ducture and leading of Providence. The
   Israelites were not to remove but as they saw the pillar of cloud
   before them. And so in all things the happiness of which depends upon
   God's secret will. See what God's providence will lead you to: Acts
   xvi. 10, We endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that
   the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them,' Sometimes we
   are left to gather and collect for our own reason what such or such a
   thing means. Now, after earnest prayer, when the fair course and
   tendency of outward circumstances lead us, we may look upon it as the
   way of God's providence for our good. It is said, Ezra viii. 21, I
   proclaimed a fast, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to
   seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all
   our substance.' How did they know the Lord was entreated for them? Why,
   after prayer they found such an over ruling instinct, such a fair
   invitation of Providence, that from thence they apparently gathered,
   This is the right way the Lord would have us walk in. This is the
   direction to be given to Christians when the event is uncertain.

   But when the event is declared in God's providence, then we have
   nothing to do but plainly to submit, and that very quietly and
   contentedly, with hope and encouragement in the Lord. And that is the
   main point.

   Doct. That it is the duty of all God's children to be willing to submit
   themselves to the dispensation of God's providence, in what ever
   befalls them or theirs.

   In this point there is:--

   I. Something implied, that all things come within the guidance of God's
   providence.

   There is nothing so high but God doeth it: Dan. iv. 35, He doeth
   according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabit
   ants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, and say unto him, What
   doest thou?' The sun doth not shine by chance, nor the rain fall by
   chance.

   There is nothing so mean but it is under God's providence: Mat. x. 29,
   30, Not a sparrow lights to the ground without your heavenly Father.' A
   mighty support unto Christians in their affliction.

   There is nothing so bad but the Lord can turn it to good: Gen. 1. 20,
   Ye thought it for evil, but God meant it for good.'

   There is nothing which happeneth from wicked men to his children but
   the Lord hath a hand in it: Job i. 21, The Lord hath given, and the
   Lord hath taken,' &c. It is Chrysostom's gloss upon that place: He doth
   not say the thief, the Sabean, the Chaldean, hath taken; no, but the
   Lord hath taken, the same God that gave it. If it come from Satan, God
   hath a hand in it, for many of Job's troubles and afflictions,
   especially upon his body, came immediately from Satan; and yet he saith
   (chap. vi. 4), The arrows of the Almighty stuck fast in me.' They were
   the arrows of the Almighty, though shot out of Satan's bow. This
   certainly is implied, that God hath a will, hand, and providence in all
   those things which are most contrary to us. The will of the Lord is to
   be seen.

   II. That which is expressed is, that we ought to submit to the
   providence of God.

   I shall prove it:--

   1. By the example of the Lord Jesus Christ: Mat. xxvi. 39, Father, not
   as I will, but as thou wilt.' He had more to lose than any of us have,
   or possibly can have; the comfort and influence of the presence of God
   in a personal union; and more to suffer. Yet he submits, and professeth
   a full subjection to his Father's will. His cup was a bitter cup, which
   made him sweat drops of curdled blood, yet he was willing to drink it,
   even the dregs, since it was his Father's will. But let me fully
   vindicate the will of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Object. You will say, Christ desires it to pass: Mat. xxvi. 39, Father,
   if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.' How could Christ make an
   offer of prayers repugnant to God's will and purpose? He knew it was
   the will of his Father that he should suffer many things, and be slain,
   and had rebuked Peter resisting the soldiers. The cup which my Father
   hath given me, shall I not drink it?' John xviii. 11.

   Many answers may be given for the clearing of this matter.

   [1.] We must know, contrary to the monothelites, that there was a
   double will in Christ, as there was a double nature--divine and human.
   These are not contrary, but yet distinct. The divine nature would,
   because it was necessary to our redemption. The human nature was to
   show a reasonable aversion of what was destructive to it; and yet the
   human nature did not contradict the will of God, because he did it not
   absolutely, but only conditionally: Father, if it be possible.'

   [2.] There is a deliberate elective will and a natural velleity. Now
   mark, the human nature did except against his suffering, not with a
   deliberate, elective will, but only by a natural velleity. There is a
   resolute will which overcometh all impediments, and there is an
   innocent desire, showing itself in a simple complacency in that which
   is good, or a displacency to that which is evil, but goes no farther.
   Apply this to the business in hand. When Christ would have the cup
   pass, it is not meant of his resolute and effective will, but only of
   his will expressing a simple displacency of the human nature to what is
   destructive to it.

   Aquinas gives us another distinction. There is a will natural and
   indeliberate, and a will deliberate and elective. The one showeth the
   sudden inclination of nature to what is good for us as we are living
   creatures; the other is an act of reason as we are reasonable
   creatures. The natural inclination of all creatures is to preserve
   themselves; but the deliberate will chooseth what the understanding
   judgeth to be good, all circumstances considered. The inclination of
   nature flees death and torments, but reason submitteth to it. As for
   instance, a bitter potion is against the inclination of nature, for, as
   we are living creatures we would be put to no pain; but the reasonable
   creature, by an elective will, takes that bitter potion for health.
   Cutting off a gangrened member is against the first inclination of man,
   as a living creature; we submit to it as a reasonable creature, lest it
   corrupt the whole body. So in the martyrs, the flesh could not but be
   against sufferings, being contrary to their well-being as living
   creatures; but the spirit, that is their reason, guided by grace,
   submitted to the greatest torments for the glory of God. Thus the Lord
   Christ saith, Let this cup pass.' There was the inclination of an
   innocent nature declining so dreadful an evil; but yet it was his meat
   and drink to do his Father's will; therefore, Not my will, but thine be
   done.'

   Others to the same purpose. There were two things willed by Christ; one
   was bonum naturae, the good of nature; the other was the glory of God
   with our salvation; and the first was desired but subordinately to the
   second. So that the Lord Christ is a notable pattern that our appetites
   and desires are not to be according to the interests of the flesh, but
   for the glory and honour of God, and the good of others.

   The next pattern we have is David, a man after God's own heart, in 2
   Sam. xv. 25, 26, Behold, here am I; let him do to me as seemeth good
   unto him.' What a meek submission was here to God's pleasure, resigning
   up his person, crown, and estate to the wise and gracious disposal of
   God, to receive a benefit or punishment as the Lord should determine.
   David sets his name to a blank, and bids God write what he pleaseth. It
   is hard for us to consent to known articles, but David wholly referreth
   himself unto God: Let him do what seemeth good unto him.'

   So Abraham, the father of the faithful, how contentedly doth he speak;
   and he thought no other but that Isaac, the son of the promise, should
   be sacrificed, Gen. xxii. 8, when his son asked him, Where is the
   burnt-offering for sacrifice?' and he answered, My son, the Lord will
   provide an offering; and so they went on their way together.' When God
   declareth his will not only contrary to our natural affection, but our
   gracious hopes, when he taketh away instruments upon whose life his
   glory seems to depend, we have the same answer, God will provide.'

   The next shall be of Eli: 1 Sam. iii. 18, It is the Lord; let him do
   whatsoever he pleaseth.' When the sentence was passed, he humbly
   submitteth. He doth not murmuringly say, Must I bear the punishment of
   my sons' iniquity? their will is not in my power; if they be wicked,
   let them answer for it. No, It is the Lord;' and his will must stand;
   It is the Lord,' who is too just to do us wrong, too good to do us
   hurt.

   The next shall be the great doctor of the Gentiles, St Paul: 2 Cor.
   xii. 7-9, And for this I besought the Lord thrice;' he knocked thrice
   at the throne of grace, as Christ prayed thrice, and Elijah prayed
   thrice for rain. Well, but the Lord made him no answer, But my grace is
   sufficient for thee.' The thorn in the flesh, some painful disease or
   affliction, must continue. And what saith Paul? Most gladly, therefore,
   will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
   rest upon me; therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches,
   in necessities, in persecutions for Christ's sake.' He doth entertain
   it with some kind of cheerfulness and thanksgiving, if he may have
   experience that the grace and power of Christ may rest upon him; it is
   enough that God's will is fulfilled, though it be with our pain and
   loss.

   Now let us consider:--

   I. Wherein this submission consists.

   II. Upon what grounds we ought to submit.

   I. Wherein this submission consists.

   Negatively, it is not to be insensible. Godliness doth not teach men
   stoicism, to harden themselves under the rod of God. The Lord complains
   of that, Jer. v. 3, I have stricken them, but they have not grieved,'
   &c. We must lay his hand to heart as well as his word. We are not to be
   like the corner-stone which bears the whole weight of the building and
   feels nothing. There are two extremes slighting the hand of God, or
   fainting under it, Heb. xii. 5; and slighting is worse than the other.
   There is no patience where there is no sense and feeling. Certainly
   there can be no improvement where there is not a feeling the rod of
   God, the strokes of his correcting hand upon us.

   But affirmatively, there is in it:--

   1. A work of the judgment, which subscribes to the justice and goodness
   of the dispensation, that it is just: Dan. ix. 7, O Lord, righteousness
   belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face.' It is a smart and
   dreadful correction, but the Lord is righteous. And to the goodness of
   it, Isa. xxxix. 8, Good is the word of the Lord.' Though it was a
   terrible word, yet the submission of a sanctified judgment calls it
   good.

   2. The act of the will is accepting of it: Lev. xxvi. 41, If they shall
   accept of the punishment of their sin.' There is a consent and choice
   of the will; such a perfect correspondence between the temper of a
   gracious heart and the will of God, they take it well and kindly from
   God that it is no worse, as a patient takes bitter pills for his good.
   There are some kind of reluctances of nature, but their overpowering
   judgment and will doth approve and accept. Afflictions are to be taken
   as a potion, not as a drench, not forced upon us whether we will or no;
   we must accept of them, take them down ourselves; it is a bitter cup,
   but it is of our heavenly physician's tempering. Seneca, a heathen,
   could say, Deo non pareo, sed assentio ex animo--I do not merely submit
   to divine providence, but consent to it. A strange thing that a heathen
   should say so. It is good, and so we accept it; not barely out of
   necessity and by a patience perforce, but there is a willing submission
   to what the Lord ordereth concerning us.

   3. There is a command reached out over the affections of anger and
   sorrow. (1.) Anger, that we may not fret against the Lord: Ps. xxxvii.
   1 , Fret not thyself against evil-doers.' Many times when words are
   kept in there is a secret rising and swelling of heart against God's
   providence; as an oven stopped up is the hotter within. So though it
   may be words do not break out, yet the heart boils, riseth, and
   dislikes God's dealing: Ps. lxii. 1, My soul, keep silence to God;' not
   only my tongue, but my soul. Thoughts are as audible with God as words;
   therefore there is a command upon our anger and indignation, that it
   may not swell and rise up against God's providence. (2.) Upon our
   sorrow, that it may not run into excess, causing disorder. We are
   allowed to grieve, but with temper and moderation. To be horny, flinty,
   dead, and sense less, whatever breaches are made upon us, doth not suit
   with the temper of a Christian. Christ hath legitimated our fears and
   sorrows, for in the days of his flesh he had his tears, sorrows, and
   groans; therefore, 1 Cor. vii. 31, mourn we should, but as we mourned
   not. If the affection be stubborn and boisterous, it must be cited
   before the tribunal of reason. We must give an account of it: Why art
   thou cast down, O my soul? hope thou in God,' Ps. xlii. 5. The upper
   part of the soul checks the excesses of the lower part when its
   commands are slighted.

   4; The tongue is bridled, lest discontent plash over; as Aaron held his
   peace,' Lev. x. 3. It was a sad stroke, but it was the Lord He kept his
   tongue from murmuring against God. If there be a fire kindled in our
   bosoms, we should not let the sparks fly abroad. Murmuring is a taxing
   of God, as if he dealt hardly and unjustly with us; and if it vents
   itself, it is more to his dishonour: Job xl. 4, 5, Behold I am vile,
   what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once I have
   spoken, but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no
   further.' Job was resolute enough before to fill his mouth with
   arguments; if once he could meet with God, he would reason the case
   with him, but presently is damped at God's appearance; and when his
   passions were a little calmed, he renounceth his former bold
   resolutions, and would no longer give vent to his distemper, and is
   resolved to be silent before God, and to give over his plea, and bury
   all his discontented thoughts in his own bosom. As if he had said, Once
   in my foolish passion I was complaining of thee, and desirous to
   dispute with thee; it is time to give over that debate, and humbly to
   submit.

   II. What are the grounds of this submission? For patience is wise and
   considerate, and proceeds upon solid reasons, as impatience is rash and
   unreasonable.

   1. They see God in his providence: Ps. xxxix. 9, I was dumb and opened
   not my mouth, because thou didst it.' That is the first principle of
   submission; surely God hath a hand in it: Isa. xxxviii. 15, What shall
   I say? he hath spoken to me, himself hath done it.' That passage,
   though it be in a song of thanksgiving, doth not relate to the
   deliverance, but the affliction, the disease and sentence of death
   which he had received. There is atheism and anti-providence in our
   murmurings. If we did see God at the end of causes, we could no more
   murmur against his providence than we can against his creation. You
   would laugh at that man that should murmur and complain because God
   made him a man and not an angel. It is as ridiculous to oppose
   yourselves against the will of God in other dispensations; and the more
   immediately the affliction comes from God, the greater our submission
   should be; as, in sickness, and death of friends and relations, It is
   the Lord.' But if subordinate instruments be used in bringing on the
   affliction, every wheel works according to the motion of the first
   mover; all the links are fastened to God's hands; therefore if we look
   no higher than the creature, we murmur, and break our teeth in biting
   at the next link. David was so far from opposing God that he bears the
   contumely of the instrument: 2 Sam. xvi. 11, Let him alone, for the
   Lord hath bid him curse.' That was a time of humiliation, not revenge.
   If God will admonish us of our duty by the injuries of men, and cure
   our impostume with the razor of their sharp tongue, we must be content.
   To resist lower officers of the state is to contemn the authority with
   which hey are armed. They could not wag their tongues without God.

   2. That God hath an absolute sovereignty to do what he will: Rom. ix.
   20, 21, Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou
   made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay? We are in his
   hands, as the clay in the hand of the potter.' His supreme right and
   dominion over the creatures, to dispose of them according to his
   pleasure, should be often thought of by us: Job ix. 12, Behold he
   taketh away, who can hinder? who shall say unto him, What doest thou?'
   He hath an absolute dominion, and is not account able to any. A man may
   do with his own as he pleaseth. Why should we not allow him the common
   privilege of all proprietors? A man may cut out his own cloth as he
   pleases. If God deprive us of any enjoyment, there is no resisting him
   by force, seeing God is omnipotent; nor ought there to be any question
   to be made of the justice of the fact, seeing he hath absolute
   dominion, and is not accountable to any. All creatures are in his hand
   to dispose of them as he pleaseth; and sometimes he sees fit to take
   them away in a violent manner, so as may most affect the parties
   interested, and show us his sovereignty. He will do it in his own way,
   by arming the thoughts and humours of our own bodies against us. Here
   our subjection to God must begin, till he be pleased to give some
   farther account of his dealing with us: Job xxxiii. 13, Why dost thou
   strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his' matters.'
   Before what tribunal will you call the Lord? Where will you cite him to
   answer for the wrong done to you? This sovereignty of God doth
   exceedingly calm the heart; God hath right alone to govern the world.
   He did govern it before we were born, and will do it when we are gone.
   He deposeth kings and disposeth kingdoms and all affairs as he will.
   Men must not prescribe rules to God, nor limit his uncontrollable
   authority. Our work is not to dispute and quarrel, but to obey and
   submit in all things.

   3. This sovereignty of God is modified and mitigated in the
   dispensation of it with several attributes. As--

   [1.] With infinite justice: Deut. xxvii. 26; when every curse was
   pronounced they were to say Amen, let it come to pass, for it is just.
   All that we suffer is deserved, nay, less than our iniquities deserve,'
   Ezra ix. 13. As the restored Israelites acknowledge, when they were in
   Babylon, they might have been in hell. Job xxxiv. 10, Far be it from
   God that he should do wickedness, or the Almighty that he should commit
   iniquity.' All such thoughts are to be rejected with abhorrence and
   indignation. We have strange conceptions and thoughts of God when under
   a temptation; ver. 23, He will not lay upon man more than right,' that
   he should enter into judgment with God. No; he goeth on just and sure
   grounds, though we do not always discern them.

   [2.] God doth it too with great faithfulness; they look on all
   afflictions as federal dispensations, as appendages of the covenant of
   grace: Ps. cxix. 75, In very faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.'
   Mark, he doth not say, notwithstanding thy faithfulness, but in
   faithfulness he performs his covenant. When he thresheth us, it is to
   make our husks fly off, that he may quicken us to a serious remembrance
   of himself, and of the duties we owe to him.

   [3.] It is ordered with great wisdom: For God is a God of judgment.'
   Isa. xxx. 18. He knows what is best for his people. We think this and
   that best, but God is wiser than we. When many providences fall out, we
   think it would be better for the church if it were otherwise. But this
   is to tax God's wisdom, and charge him with want of love and tenderness
   towards his people; they are dearer to him than they are to you.
   Chrysostom shows how we take upon us to order affairs. He brings in an
   instance of a man that is very kind to the poor; if he dies they are
   undone: have you more care of them than God their maker? Job did not
   eat his morsels alone, but the poor did eat his bread, and were clothed
   with his fleece, therefore the sides of the poor are said to bless him.
   Cannot God provide for the poor without Job? So in like cases for the
   church's sake. This providence seems to tend altogether to evince; but
   God knows how by these and these means to provide for his people; and
   you must not prescribe to him. It was blasphemy in Alphonsus to say, Si
   Deo a consiliis adfuisset, se consultius multa ordinaturum--That if he
   had been by when God made the world, he would have ordered some things
   with greater advice and better care. He would not have placed the horns
   of the beasts above their eyes, but under their eyes.' Such blasphemy
   do we secretly lisp out in our murmurings and discourses about
   providence, when we are questioning how this, that, and the other thing
   can be for his glory. The Lord knows how to guide all things to his
   glory, and we must absolutely yield to it.

   [4.] With much love; for he that hath the wisdom of a father hath also
   the bowels of a mother. A mother may sooner forget a poor shiftless
   child than God will forget his people, Isa. xlix. 15, &c. There is a
   great deal of love showed in our afflictions. Sometimes in mitigating
   them: 1 Cor. x. 13, God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
   tempted above what you are able to bear.' And as Jacob drove on as the
   little ones were able to bear, so the Lord suits his conduct and lays
   on the affliction as his people are able to bear. Castles are
   victualled before they are besieged. After great comforts then comes
   affliction: Heb. x. 32, After you were enlightened ye endured a great
   fight of affliction.' Then again, in refreshing their troubles with
   many gracious experiences. The Lord doth things which seem very bitter
   to the carnal sense and gust, but when he hath defecated and refined
   our taste, then he sheds abroad his love into our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost, Rom. v. 3, 5. Their adoption is cleared up, and the loss of
   outward comfort is accompanied with a greater increase of spiritual
   comfort. Again, he shows his love in ordering all things for their
   good, Rom. viii. 28. Out of what corner soever the wind blows, it blows
   good to the saints. Arise, north wind, and blow thou south,' &c. North
   and south, contrary points; Cant. iv. 16, yet the spices of his garden
   flow out;' that which is against our will is not against our profit;
   God is still pursuing what is for his own glory and good of the elect.
   So all that falleth out is either good or will tend to good.

   Use. This teacheth us upon what grounds there should be such a
   submission to all personal and domestical calamities which may befall
   any of us, and to all that befall the church. It is the will of God;
   and that is the great ground of composing the heart whatever falleth
   out. Whenever you hear of the increase of violence, or any resolution
   against the people of God, this should calm us, The will of the Lord be
   done;' God knows what is best for his people. This is an everlasting
   ground of comfort, that we are still in God's hands, and what ever
   befalls us, it comes by his special providence, even by his that
   numbers the hairs of our heads, and who carves out every condition to
   us: Deut. xxxiii. 3, Surely he loved his people; all the saints are in
   his hands.' When the disciples were sore troubled and affrighted, John
   vi. 20, Jesus comes to them and said, Be not afraid, it is I' that
   order this. There are many remarkable passages in that story. The
   disciples were, in the dark of the night, overtaken with a mighty
   storm, and for a long time did not know what would become of them. The
   text saith they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs before
   Christ appears. Christ seeth it not fit to appear at first, but lets
   the trial go on until it be a trial indeed.. Now about the fourth watch
   of the night, Jesus passed by, Mark vi. 48; that is the morning watch,
   and then Jesus appears to them. We are very tender of ourselves, and
   soon think we are low and tried enough, therefore would fain be
   delivered; but our wise Lord seeth we need more. When Christ came, then
   their fears are increased. Christ came walking upon the water, and they
   thought it was a spectre. Spirits broken with troubles are very apt to
   take in afflicting impressions from everything they see and hear. The
   very way of our mercies may be matter of terror to us. At length he
   discovereth himself: It is I, be not afraid.' I walk upon that water
   which seems to be ready to swallow, you up. I, that raised the waves,
   know how to still them. Here is that which may allay all our disquiets
   and fears. Remember, it is not the instrument but Christ and God must
   be eyed, and the will of the Lord be done.

   In our darkest condition God seeth us, when we do not see him: Ps.
   lxxiii. 22, 23, and Job xxiii. 9, 10, I looked on the left hand where
   he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right
   hand that I cannot see him. But he knoweth the way that I take: when he
   hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold!'

SERMON XVI.

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.--John III. 16.

   IN these words you have the sum and substance of the gospel. In them
   observe:--

   1. The fountain and original of all that grace and salvation which is
   brought unto us, God's unspeakable love to mankind: God so loved the
   world.

   2. The way which God took to recover our lapsed condition, or the
   effect and fruit which flows from this fountain: that he gave his
   only-begotten Son.

   3. The end of it.: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life; where take notice of--

   [1.] The qualification, or the free and easy condition put upon men in
   the gospel: that whosoever believeth in him.

   [2.] The benefit that resulteth to us, expressed negatively and
   affirmatively: should not perish, but have everlasting life.

   First, The rise and beginning of all is God's inconceivable love: God
   so loved the world.' Where observe:--

   1. The object: the world.

   2. The act: loved.

   3. The degree: so loved.

   1. The word by which the object is expressed is the world,' which
   noteth mankind in its corrupt and miserable state: 1 John v. 19, The
   whole world lies in sin.' The world is a heap of men who had broken
   .God's law, forfeited his love and favour; they neither loved nor
   feared God, but were unthankful and unholy; yet this world God loved.

   2. The act: he loved.' The love of God is twofold--the love of
   benevolence and the love of complacence.

   [1.] The love of benevolence is the pity and compassion of God towards
   man lying in sin and misery. This is understood in this place, as also
   in Titus iii. 4, The kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man
   appeared.'

   [2,] The love of complacence. So he loveth us when he hath made us
   lovely. In which sense it is said, Ps. xi. 7, The righteous God loveth
   righteousness;' John xvi. 27, The Father himself loveth you, because ye
   loved me.' This belongeth not to this place.

   3. The degree: so loved.' He doth not tell you how much, but leaveth it
   to your most solemn, raised thoughts. It is rather to be conceived than
   spoken of, and admired rather than conceived.

   Observe from the words:--

   That the beginning .and first cause of our salvation is the mere love
   of God. The outward occasion was our misery, the inward moving cause
   was God's love.

   [1.] Love is at the bottom of all. We may give a reason of other
   things, but we cannot give a reason of his love. God showed his wisdom,
   power, justice, and holiness in our redemption by Christ. If you ask,
   Why he made so much ado about a worthless creature, raised out of the
   dust of the ground at first, and had now disordered himself, and could
   be of no use to him? We have an answer at hand, Because he loved us. If
   you continue to ask, But why did he love us? We have no other answer
   but because he loved us; for beyond the first rise of things we cannot
   go. And the same reason is given by Moses, Deut. vii. 7, 8, The Lord
   did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in
   number than any people, for ye were the fewest of all people; but
   because the Lord loved you;' that is, in short, he loved you because he
   loved you. The same reason is given by our Lord Jesus Christ, Mat. xi.
   26, Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.' All came from
   his free and undeserved mercy; higher we cannot go in seeking after the
   causes of what is done for our salvation.

   [2.] The most remarkable thing that is visible in the progress and
   perfection of our salvation by Christ is love. And it is meet that the
   beginning, middle, and end should suit. Nay, if love be so conspicuous
   in the whole design and carrying on of this blessed work, it is much
   more in the rise and fountain. God's great end in our redemption was
   the demonstration of his love and mercy to mankind; yea, not only the
   demonstration, but the commendation of it. That is the apostle's word,
   Rom. v. 8, God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us.' A thing may be demonstrated as real that
   is not commended or set forth as great. God's design was that we should
   not only believe the reality, but admire the greatness of his love.
   Now, from first to last love is so conspicuous that we cannot overlook
   it. Light is not more conspicuous in the sun than the love of God in
   our redemption; by Christ.

   [3.] If there were any other cause, it must be either the merit of
   Christ, or some worthiness on our part.

   (1.) The merit of Christ was not the first cause of God's love, but the
   manifestation, fruit, and effect of it. The text telleth, he first
   loved the world,' and then gave his only-begotten Son.' It is said, 1
   John iii. 16, Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down
   his life for us.' Look, as we perceive and find out causes by their
   proper effects, so we perceive the love of God by the death of Christ.
   Christ is the principal means whereby God carrieth on the purposes of
   his grace, and therefore is represented in scripture as the servant of
   his decrees.

   (2.) No worthiness in us; for when his love moved him to give Christ
   for us, he had all mankind in his prospect and view, as lying in the
   polluted mass, or in a state of sin and misery, and then provided a
   Redeemer for them. God at first made a perfect law, which forbade all
   sin upon pain of death. Man did break this law, and still we break it
   day by day in every sin. Now when men lived, and went on in sin and
   hostility against God, he was pleased then to send his Son to assume
   our nature, and die for our transgressions. Therefore the giving of a
   Redeemer was the work of his free mercy. Man loved not God, yea, was an
   enemy to God, when Christ came to make the atonement: 1 John iv. 10,
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins;' Col. i. 21, And you that
   were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works,
   yet now hath he reconciled.' We were senseless of our misery, careless
   of our remedy; so far from deserving, that we desired no such matter.
   God's love was at the beginning, not ours.

   Use 1. Is to confute all misapprehensions of God. It is the grand
   design of Satan to lessen our opinion of God's goodness. So he
   assaulted our first parents, as if God (notwithstanding all his
   goodness in their creation) was envious of man's felicity and
   happiness. And he hath not left off his old wont. He seeketh to hide
   God's goodness, and to represent him as a God that delighteth in our
   destruction and damnation, rather than in our salvation; as if he were
   inexorable, and hardly entreated to do us good. And why? That we may
   stand aloof from God, and apprehend him as unlovely. Or if he cannot
   prevail so far, he tempteth us to poor, unworthy, mean thoughts of his
   goodness and mercy. Now we cannot obviate the temptation better than by
   due reflections on his love in giving his Son for the world. This
   showeth that he is fuller of mercy and goodness than the sun is of
   light or the sea of water. So great an effect shows the greatness of
   the cause. Wherefore did he express his love in such a wonderful,
   astonishing way, but that we might have higher and larger thoughts of
   his goodness and mercy? By other effects we easily collect the
   perfection of his attributes; that his power is omnipotent, Rom. i. 20;
   that his knowledge is omniscient, Heb. iv. 12, 13. And by this effect
   it is easy to conceive that his love is infinite, or that God is love.'

   Use 2. Is to quicken us to admire the love of God in Christ.

   There are three things which commend any favour done unto us;--(1.) The
   good will of him that giveth; (2.) The greatness of the gift; (3.) The
   unworthiness of him that receiveth. All concur here.

   1. The good will of him that giveth. Nothing moved God to do this but
   his own love. It was from the free motion of his own heart, without our
   thought .and asking. No other reason is given or can be given. We made
   no suit for any such thing; it could not enter into our minds and
   hearts; into our minds to conceive, or into our hearts to desire, such
   a remedy to recover the lapsed estate of mankind. Not into our minds,
   for it is a great mystery: 1 Tim. iii. 16, And without controversy,
   great is the mystery of godliness,' &c. Not into our hearts to ask or
   desire; for it would have seemed a strange request that we should ask
   that the eternal Son of God should assume our flesh, and be made sin
   and a curse for us. But grace hath wrought exceeding abundantly, above
   all that we can ask or think,' Eph. iii. 20; above what we can imagine,
   and above what we can pray for to him.

   2. The greatness of the gift. Great things do even force their way into
   our minds, whether we will or no. The gift of Jesus Christ is so great,
   that the love of God is gone to the uttermost in it. He hath not a
   better Christ, nor a more worthy Redeemer, nor another Son to die for
   us; nor could the Son of God suffer greater indignities than he hath
   suffered for our sakes. God said to Abraham, Gen. xxii. 12, Now I know
   that thou fearest God, since thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
   son, from me,' God was not ignorant before, but the meaning is, this is
   an apparent proof and instance of it. So now we may know God loveth us;
   here is the manifest token and sign of it.

   3. The unworthiness of him that receiveth; this is also in the case. We
   were altogether unworthy that the Son of God should be incarnate, and
   die for our sakes. This is notably improved by the apostle, Rom. v. 7,
   8, For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, but for a good man
   some would even dare to die: but God commendeth his love to us, in that
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.' The apostle alludeth to
   the distinction familiar among the Jews: they had their good men, or
   bountiful; their righteous men, zealous for the law; and their wicked
   men, obnoxious to judgment. Peradventure one would venture his life for
   a very merciful person, but you shall hardly find any to be so liberal
   and friendly as to venture his life for a righteous and just man, or a
   man of rigid innocence. But mark, there are abating terms--scarcely and
   perhaps. The case is rare that one should die for another, be he never
   so good and righteous. But God's expression of mercy was infinitely
   above the proportion of any the most friendly man ever showed. There
   was nothing in the object to move him to it, when we were neither good
   nor just, but wicked. Without respect to any worth in us, for we were
   all in a damnable estate, he sent his Son to die for us, to rescue and
   free us from eternal death, and to make us partakers of eternal life.
   God so loved the world, when we had so sinned, and wilfully plunged
   ourselves into an estate of damnation.

   But you will say, If this mercy be so great, why are men no more
   affected with it?

   I answer:--

   1. Because of their stupid carelessness; they do not see the need of
   this mercy, and therefore do not prize the worth of it. If they were
   sensible that there is an avenger of blood at their heels, or God's
   wrath making inquisition for sinners, they would more earnestly run
   into the city of refuge, Heb. vi. 18.

   2. They do not truly believe this mystery of grace, but speak of it by
   rote and hearsay, after others. All affections follow faith: 1 Peter
   ii. 7, Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious.'

   3. They do not seriously consider the importance of it, therefore the
   weightiest objects do not stir us; our minds are taken up about toys
   and trifles.

   4. They have not the lively light of the Spirit: Rom. v. 5, The love of
   God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
   us.' It is not our dry thoughts and doctrinal knowledge that will
   affect and change our heart, till the Spirit turneth our light into
   love and our knowledge into taste.

   Use 3. Is to exhort us:--

   1. To improve this love. It is an invitation to seek after God; for see
   what preparations his love hath made to recover you to himself and will
   not you be recovered? God doth not hate you, and therefore you need not
   flee from him as a revenging God: He so loved the world, that he gave
   his only-begotten Son.' In that capacious expression you are not
   excluded, therefore exclude not yourselves. And such a broad foundation
   of his mercy being laid, what may you not expect from it? 2 Cor. v. 19.
   He hath procured a remedy and ransom; as soon as you repent and
   believe, you shall have the comfort of it.

   2. It exhorteth us also to answer it with a fervent love to him that
   hath given such a signal demonstration of his love to us: 1 John iv.
   19, We love him, because he first loved us.' Men always expect to be
   loved there where they love, and think it hard dealing if it be not so.

   3. Let your love to God be like his love to you. Love was at the bottom
   of all this grace; let it be at the bottom of all your duties: Let all
   your things be done in love,' 1 Cor. xvi. 14. Let your carriage
   apparently be a life of love: 2 Cor. v. 14, 15, For the love of Christ
   constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then
   were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should
   not live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose
   again.'

   II. I come now to the second branch of the text--the way God took to
   express his love to us: He gave his only-begotten Son,' Jesus Christ is
   so called to distinguish him from the adopted children, and to show his
   personal subsistence, which is by way of filiation, or being eternally
   begotten in the divine essence. So great was our misery, that no less
   remedy would serve the turn; and so great God's mercy, that he with
   held him not from us.

   Doct. The greatest manifestation of God's love to the sons of men is
   the giving his only-begotten Son to be their Redeemer and Saviour.

   There is a twofold giving of Christ:--

   1. He is given for us.

   2. He is given to us.

   1. He was given for us when he was sent into the world to be come bone
   of our bone and flesh of our flesh, and to die for our sins. This is
   spoken of, Rom. viii. 32, God spared not his Son, but delivered him up
   for us all.'

   2. He is given to us, when we have a special interest in him, and a
   participation of his benefits: 1 Cor. i. 30, Christ Jesus is made of
   God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.'

   He is given for us, as he took our nature; he is given to us, as he
   dwelleth in our hearts by faith. He is given for us, as he undertook
   the work of our redemption; he is given to us, as he accomplished! and
   brings about our conversion to God, and applying to us the benefits of
   his purchase. I shall speak of both.

   I. As he is given for us, it mightily bespeaketh the love of God, and
   his care of our salvation. In creation, God made us after his own image
   and likeness; in redemption, his Son came in the similitude and
   likeness of sinful flesh. In creation, the angels were dignified above
   us, but not in redemption, Heb. ii. 16. He did not redeem the apostate
   angels. In short, this was the most convenient way for God to bring
   about the purposes of his grace towards man, for these reasons:--

   1. That our faith might be more certain, by the appearing of the Son of
   God in our nature, by his dying, rising again from the dead, and
   ascending into heaven, and so giving a sensible proof of our whole
   religion.

   [1.] By appearing in human nature he had opportunity of conversing with
   men, to convince them of the gracious will of God, and teach them
   obedience to him, not only by his doctrine, but his example, and
   securing the truth of both by the many miracles which he wrought in the
   days of his flesh: John vi. 27, Him hath the Father sealed;' that is,
   owned, acknowledged, demonstrated, that whatever he did or said was the
   will and good pleasure of God.

   [2.] By his dying he satisfied the justice of God, and so maketh a way
   for the course of his mercy to us, that we might obtain release and
   pardon of all our sins and transgressions against the law of God: Rom.
   iii. 25, 26, Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
   in his blood, to declare his righteousness, for the remission of sins
   that are past, through the forbearance of God,' &c.

   [3.] His rising again from the dead was a visible satisfaction to the
   world that his sacrifice was accepted: Rom. iv. 25, Who was delivered
   for our offences, and raised again for our justification.' The
   unbelieving world by that supreme act of power have no reason to stand
   out against his faith and doctrine.

   [4.] By his ascending into heaven, the truth of eternal life was more
   confirmed, for thereby he gave us a real demonstration of that glory
   which he spoke of and promised to his disciples and followers: 1 Peter
   i. 21, God raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your
   faith and hope might be in God.' He himself is entered into that
   happiness, and we shall follow him.

   2. That our hope might be more strong and lively, being built upon the
   example of Christ and his promises to us. The example of Christ is of
   great support to us in all our troubles, for if we fare as he fared in
   this world, we shall fare as he fareth in the world to come. Therefore
   we are said to be begotten to a lively hope by the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead,' 1 Peter i. 3; that is, have a ground of
   hope and cheerful assurance, as he by his sufferings came to his reward
   and crown, so shall we obtain the matter of his promises: 1 John ii.
   25, And this is the promise which he hath promised, even eternal life;'
   John xii. 26, If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am,
   there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
   honour.'

   3. That our love to God may be more fervent. If God had saved us some
   other way, the salvation had been something less; for according to the
   degrees of the gift, so is our obligation. Now God would oblige us at
   the highest rate, and therefore he gave his only-begotten Son to die
   for us. It is said, he spared not his own Son,' Rom. viii. 32. There is
   a twofold not sparing--either in a way of impartial justice, or in a
   way of transcendent bounty; the last is chiefly intended in that place,
   though the other is not altogether excluded. He delivered him up to die
   for our sakes. Now surely this should gain much upon us, when God
   thought nothing too good to part with for our salvation.

   4. It makes our obedience more ready, for Jesus Christ came to live by
   the same law that we were bound to: Gal. iv. 4, When the fulness of
   time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the
   law.' Yea, to obey God at the dearest rates: Heb. v. 8, 9, Though he
   were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered:
   and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto
   all them that obey him.' He submitted unto and performed the whole law:
   his obedience cost him dear, since an ignominious and shameful death
   was a part of it.

   II. God, that gave Christ for us, giveth him also to us, and with him
   the benefits of pardon, reconciliation, adoption, and right to eternal
   life, if we be duly qualified. The offer is made in the gospel: on our
   part there is required only a thankful acceptance of Christ on his own
   terms. This also is the greatest gift, for the other is in order to
   this, and this is the completing of it, and applying it for our
   comfort. I shall prove it by three reasons:--

   1. Without Christ there is no recovery of what we lost.

   2. No removal of that misery we incurred.

   3. No obtaining of what we should desire and pursue after as our proper
   happiness.

   1. No recovery of what we lost. What did we lose by the fall?--the
   image and favour of God, and fellowship with God.

   [1.] The image of God was defaced by sin. Man abode not in the honour
   of his creation, but became as the beasts that perish. Now the
   restitution of this great gift we only have by Christ, who is the
   pattern and author of it. The pattern: 2 Cor. iii. 18, We all, with
   open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
   into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
   Lord.' The author: Titus iii. 5, 6, Not by works of righteousness which
   ye have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
   regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us
   abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.' Till we are in him, and
   be one with him, we have not this great benefit: 2 Cor. v. 17, If any
   man be in Christ, he is a new creature.' We are destitute of that image
   of God wherein we were created, and better we had never been born,
   unless new born.

   [2.] The favour of God, which is an immediate consequent of his image.
   God delighted in man as innocent, but man sinful is the object of God's
   wrath, loathing, and aversion. Therefore Christ died to recover man to
   the love and favour of God: 2 Cor. v. 14, To make peace between the
   offended sovereign and subject offending; to interpose between God
   angry and man guilty. Now this breach continueth till we are reconciled
   by Christ, till we love God, and are beloved by him. And better we had
   been in a lower rank of creatures, than to continue under God's
   displeasure; for the misery of the beast dies with them, death puts an
   end to all their pains at once; but the wrath of God, not appeased by
   Christ, continues on the sinner for ever.

   [3.] Fellowship with God was lost by the fall. Man was driven out of
   paradise, and shut out of God's presence by a flaming sword (Gen. iii.
   24), the emblem of his wrath, and all intercourse was broken off; but
   Christ came to open the way, by whom we have access unto God with
   boldness and confidence,' Eph. iii. 12. Heb. iv. 16, Let us therefore
   come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
   find grace to help in a time of need.' We need daily access to God, we
   cannot live without him. How can we look him in the face with any
   comfort when we have no mediator? we cannot have any serious thoughts
   of him without trembling.

   2. There is removal of that misery which we have incurred, which is the
   death and curse wherein we are involved by sin. As long as the curses
   of the law stand in full force against us, we can have no firm
   confidence; if we look to time past, there is a huge heap of sins, the
   least of which is enough to sink us into hell; if we look to time
   present, our nature being not yet healed, our hearts swarm with divers
   lusts, and we are ready to sin again; if to time to come, death, hell,
   and judgment affright us. Christ findeth us where Adam left us, in the
   highway to hell and damnation: John iii. 18, Condemned already;' and to
   hope for any release, unless it be upon God's terms, is to make him
   untrue and unjust. Certainly God will not break his word, and disturb
   the order of his covenant for your sakes. Therefore how will you escape
   the curse and condemnation of the law if Christ be not given to you?

   3. There is no obtaining of what we should desire and pursue after as
   our proper happiness, but only by Christ. Man was made for God, and
   cannot be happy without him, and he is most completely happy in the
   full enjoyment of him. Now there is no coming to that blessed state but
   by Christ: John xiv. 6, He is the way to the Father. The most eminent
   sense is with respect to our final blessedness, when we come into his
   immediate presence: so 1 John v. 11, This is the record, that God hath
   given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.' It is Christ alone
   that can put us in the way, and bring us home to eternal bliss.

   Use 1 . Is to confute the world's opinion, who measure God's love by
   outward things or worldly felicity. Alas! the love or hatred of God is
   not known by these things, Eccles. ix. 1, 2, neither can the heart of
   man be satisfied with them; these things can give us a bellyful, but
   not a heartful, Ps. xvii. 14, 15. Those that take up with the creature,
   never felt the weight of sin, are not serious in matters of eternal
   concernments. The only true happiness is in having God for our God,
   Christ for our Redeemer, the Spirit for our sanctifier and comforter.

   Use 2. Is to excite us to bless God for Jesus Christ. The apostle doth
   frequently in all his groans and afflictions: Rom. vii. 25, I thank
   God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,' &c.;' Blessed be God for the grace
   of Jesus Christ,' whereby we have pardon for what is past, and grace
   for the future to perform what God will accept. So 1 Cor. xv. 57,
   Thanks be to God, which gives us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
   Christ,' God by Christ hath given us the victory over sin, death, and
   hell. So should you, especially in the Lord's Supper--it is an
   Eucharist be thankful that God hath given Christ for us, which is an
   unspeakable gift. And now he cometh to give him to you, afford him a
   hearty welcome into your souls as you take him, and apply him by faith,
   and give up yourselves to him as his redeemed ones. You come to look
   upon Christ, who made his soul an offering for sin; he is here
   represented as crucified before your eyes, and is by God specially
   offered to your acceptance, and with him pardon and life. You must be
   joyful and thankful for these great gifts and benefits, so dearly
   bought, so surely sealed, so freely offered, and in the sense of all
   this devote yourselves to God.

   Use 3. Make it your main care to see if Christ be given to us. Without
   him you cannot have any true remedy against evil, nor any solid hope of
   good. Certain it is that in our natural estate we were without him. Is
   there a change? The two great ends for which Christ came were, to
   appease God, and to be the principle of a new life. Is Christ given for
   these ends? Have you received him? Do not think Christ fell from heaven
   into your bosom whether you would or no. Did you ever feel your misery
   without him, and cry mightily to God, Give me Christ, or else I die,
   and perish for ever? I confess, conversion is not always evident in
   feeling, but it is in the effect and fruit. What fruits have you then
   abiding in you? The great fruit of Christ being given to you is the
   Spirit's dwelling in you: Rom. viii. 1, But ye are not in the flesh,
   but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.'
   The great work of the Spirit is to sanctify the soul to the service of
   him that redeemed us: Titus ii. 14, Who gave himself for us, that he
   might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works.' Clear this, and the cause is decided.

   III. I come now to the third part of the text, which is the end of this
   love, That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have life
   everlasting;' where I observe--

   1. The connection of our duty and privilege. Christ died to procure a
   covenant wherein pardon and life is offered to us upon gracious terms.
   In the gospel we must observe what God hath promised, and what we must
   do; both must be alike acceptable to us, the duty as well as the
   benefit, or else we consent not to the whole tenor of the covenant.

   2. The universality of the proposal, that whosoever believeth on him;
   no sorts of men are excluded from the remedy but those that exclude
   themselves by their impenitency and unbelief.

   3. The nature of this act and duty which giveth a right and title to
   the benefits offered, and that is believing: no more is mentioned here.
   But none truly believe but those that carry themselves accordingly, or
   perform the duties which that belief calleth for. If it be such a
   lively operative faith, it will secure our title to these benefits.

   4. The benefits are negatively and positively expressed; negatively,
   they shall not perish; positively, but have everlasting life.'

   [1.] The negative expression is mentioned, partly because of our former
   deserts; we incurred the sentence of eternal death, which is taken off
   from penitent believers; they shall not be condemned with the
   unbelieving world: partly because of our present fears; guilt presents
   destruction before our eyes, but the cause of that is taken away as sin
   is remitted and weakened: and partly to support us in our troubles:
   they may be afflicted, but not perish for ever; chastened, but not
   destroyed; not for perdition, but amendment.

   [2.] The positive part is expressed partly to show our heavenly
   Father's love, who cannot be satisfied till he hath brought us into his
   immediate presence; and partly to answer the desire of the faithful,
   who long for everlasting communion with him; we cannot be satisfied
   till we be for ever with the Lord, in a perfect state of subjection to
   him, and fruition of him.

   Doct. That faith is the way which God hath appointed whereby to receive
   benefits by Christ.

   I. What faith is.

   II. How this is to be understood.

   III. Why the gospel covenant layeth so much weight on it.

   What is faith? Surely it concerns us to know it, since the scriptures
   speak so much of it everywhere. There are in it three things;--(1.)
   Assent; (2.) consent; (3.) trust.

   1. A firm and cordial assent to this truth, that Jesus is the Son of
   God and Saviour of mankind, who came down from heaven and suffered for
   our sins, and became the foundation of that new covenant which offereth
   pardon and hopes of bliss to all those who, feeling the burden of their
   sins, will trust their souls upon Christ's redemption and ransom, and
   forsake the world, the flesh, and the devil, and take him for their
   only Lord and Saviour, that by him they may return to God. This assent
   is a part of faith, but this is not all. The reason able soul in man
   hath life, sense, appetite, and motion, as the souls of the beasts
   have; but this is not the difference between us and them: besides
   sense, life, and appetite, we have reason and discourse. So here,
   knowledge and assent are implied in faith, but more is required to make
   it justifying and saving. Assent is good as it is inductive of other
   things, or leadeth on other things, to wit, choice and trust; and it is
   not only good, but necessary, lest we build without a foundation. It
   was of great weight heretofore, when Christ's person and doctrine was
   more questioned and contradicted: John viii. 24, Unless ye believe that
   I am he, ye shall die in your sins;' lose all the benefit of his
   coming. It is said, 1 John v. 1, Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
   Christ, is born of God.' It was a mighty thing then to believe and
   profess Christ to be the Messiah, and to cleave to that profession,
   whatever temptations they had to the contrary. But I dare not leave the
   decision of men's spiritual estate upon that trial only; the bleak
   winds that blew then in their faces, blow now on our backs; and it is
   as dangerous now to deny Christ to be the Messiah, as it was for them
   to profess it. However, assent is still necessary, to put the greater
   life and power into our faith; for if the fire were well kindled, it
   would of itself break out into a flame. The stronger our assent is, the
   more powerful to beget love and dependence on God's promises, obedience
   to his commands, and perseverance notwithstanding temptations. This
   assent, to do its work, must be firm and cordial.

   [1.] Firm. You must believe unfeignedly that Christ is the Messiah and
   Redeemer of the world: Acts ii. 36, Let the house of Israel know
   assuredly that God hath made this Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both
   Lord and Christ.' The word signifies safely, they may venture their all
   upon it: John xvii. 8, They have known.' There is a common customary
   superficial belief, that men take up upon the credit of their
   forefathers, and the consent of the country where they live, and there
   is a sound persuasion of the truth of the gospel wrought in us by the
   Spirit of God. And though human credulity doth little, yet this last
   serveth to renew the soul: Mat. xvi. 17, Flesh and blood hath not
   revealed it to thee, but my Father which is in heaven;' when Peter had
   said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.' This makes us
   victorious over the devil, the world, and the flesh: 1 John v. 5, Who
   is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is
   the Son of God?' If this important supreme truth were well believed, it
   would doubtless prevail against the allurements of the world and the
   flesh, and make men see that they have something else than this
   deceitful world to look after. Truths go to the quick when soundly
   believed.

   [2.] Cordial. Many seem verily to be persuaded that Jesus is the Son of
   God, but are no way affected with this mystery of grace, nor changed.
   The devils may give a bare assent to this great gospel truth. Compare
   Mark v. 7 with Mat. xvi. 16, the confession of the devil with the
   profession of Peter. The devil owned Jesus to be the Son of the most
   high God, as well as Peter, the Son of the living God. Austin's
   observation is very good: Hoc dicebat Petrus, hoc dicebant daemones,
   Petrus ut Christum amplecteretur, daemones ut Christus ab iis
   recederet--Peter said the same thing, and the devil the same thing;
   Peter said it that he might embrace Christ, the devils that he might
   depart from them. It is one thing to be of this opinion that Christ is
   the Saviour of the world, another to accept and receive him into our
   hearts.

   2. The next thing which I shall observe in faith is a consent to
   receive Christ as God offereth him to us in the gospel: John i. 12, To
   as many as received him,' &c. He gave power to become the sons of God
   to as many as believed on his name.

   [1.] It is not a rash consent, but such as is deliberate, serious, and
   advised. When we assure men that God in the gospel calls them to accept
   of Christ as their Lord and Saviour, and that they shall be pardoned
   and saved, they are ready to say with all their heart; but they do not
   consider what it is to receive Christ, and therefore retract their
   consent almost as soon as it is given. Therefore Christ directeth us to
   sit down and count the charges, that we may allow for opposition and
   temptations, Luke xiv. 28-33. When you have considered his strict laws,
   made a full allowance for incident difficulties and temptations, and
   can resolve, forsaking all others, to cleave to him alone for
   salvation.

   [2.] It must not be a forced and involuntary consent, such as a person
   maketh when he is frighted into a little religiousness for the present,
   but would never mind it, nor yield to it, if he were in a state of full
   liberty. It may be in a distress or pang of conscience; by all means
   they must have Christ; or when sick are afraid to die, or under some
   great judgments; as the Israelites when they heard the thundering on
   Mount Sinai: All that thou hast commanded us, we will do.' Deut. v. 27.
   No; this will not serve the turn: the will must be effectually inclined
   to Christ, and to God the Father by him, as our utmost felicity and
   end. All Christ's people are a willing people, Ps. cx. 3.

   [3.] It must be a resolved consent, a fixed, not an ambulatory will,
   which we take up for a purpose, or at some certain times for a solemn
   duty or so. No; you must cleave to him with full purpose of heart,'
   Acts xi. 23. Trample upon everything that would separate you from him,
   Phil. iii. 8, 9; Rom. viii. 36, to the end. It must not be a feeble
   consent, such as is contradicted by every foolish and hurtful lust, but
   a prevalent consent, such as can maintain itself against difficulties
   and temptations, and the oppositions of the flesh, and control all
   other desires and delights.

   [4.] It must not be partial, but a total, universal consent; not only a
   consent of dependence or trust, to accept of Christ as our Saviour, but
   a consent of subjection to him as our Lord: Col. ii. 6, As ye have
   received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him.' Many would have Christ
   and his benefits, but they would not yield that he should reign over
   them: Luke xix. 27, Those mine enemies, that would not I should reign
   over them, bring them hither and slay them before me.' But the true
   believing implieth a taking of Christ and his yoke: Mat. xi. 29, Take
   my yoke upon you,' &c. Christ and his cross, Mat. xvi. 24, If any man
   will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
   follow me.' It is accompanied with a resolution to obey his laws and
   keep his commandments, that we may abide in his love.

   3. The third thing in faith is trust, spoken of Eph. i. 13, In whom ye
   trusted, after ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your
   salvation.' Trust is a dependence upon Christ for the blessings which
   he hath procured for us, and promised to us; and is represented by the
   metaphors of staying the mind on God: Isa. xxvi. 3, Thou keepest him in
   perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in
   thee.' By the staying of the mind is intended its fixedness and
   stability, when, being satisfied with the promises, we can comfortably
   wait for the event and issue. The other metaphor is, committing
   ourselves to God: 2 Tim. i. 12, For I know whom I have believed, and I
   am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto
   him against that day.' When we can trust our all in Christ's hands,
   knowing that he can give us that righteousness whereby we may stand
   before God, and have comfortable access to him, and at length give us
   that eternal life which is our supreme happiness. When you can trust
   him for deliverance from the guilt, power, and punishment of sin, and
   for the beginning, strengthening, and preserving of grace in us to
   everlasting life, you have obtained a good degree of faith. Only for
   the further opening of this trust, I must observe to you:--

   [1.] That this trust respects all Christ's offices, which are, prophet,
   priest, and king. You trust him as a prophet when you give up
   yourselves as his disciples to the conduct of his word and Spirit,
   being persuaded that he will infallibly teach you the way to true
   happiness: John vi. 68, 69, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the
   words of eternal life; and we believe and are sure that thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the living God.' This trust is our remedy against
   all false religions; for what should draw us from the true and chief
   doctor of the church? You trust him as a priest, when you believe the
   value of his merit and sacrifice, and comfort yourselves with his
   gracious promises and covenant, and come to God with more boldness and
   hope of mercy upon the account of his intercession, especially in your
   great extremities, Heb. iv. 14-16. Therefore we may pray confidently,
   and make an open and free discovery of our wants and requests to God,
   who will relieve us, and do what is best for us in a fit season, when
   we most want it and least expect it. We must trust him as a king, when
   we become his subjects, and are persuaded that he will govern us in
   truth and righteousness, in order to our salvation, and defend us by
   his mighty power till he hath brought us to glory and blessedness: 2
   Tim. iv. 18, The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and
   preserve me to his heavenly kingdom.'

   [2.] That this trust is practical, and is not to be determined by our
   confidence so much as obedience and resolution to take the way which
   God hath prescribed, that we may obtain the blessings which he hath
   promised to us. This consideration is necessary, partly because God or
   Christ will be trusted no farther than he hath obliged himself, and so
   far we may depend upon him. Now Christ hath only obliged himself to be
   the author of eternal salvation to those that obey him,' Heb. v. 9.
   Partly because this obedience is difficult, self-denial is required,
   Mat. xvi. 24, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself,' &c.
   A surer note of our faith than a confidence or a presumption that we
   shall fare well enough though we indulge the ease and desires of the
   flesh, and gratify our interest in the world; and therefore, faith
   being an obediential confidence, doth confute these vain conceits. Many
   think they may the more boldly venture on sin, the more they believe,
   or seem to believe, the grace of God in Christ. Others think all their
   business is to get a victory over their consciences, and though they do
   not deny their lusts, yet if they can be strongly persuaded that God
   will be merciful to them in Christ, they shall not perish but obtain
   everlasting life. No; we must obey, we must deny ourselves, or else we
   do not trust Christ to bring us to heaven in his own ways and methods,
   but trust to some vain conceits of our own.

   II. How this is to be understood, that whosoever believeth,' since many
   other things are required of us, as repentance, mortification of sin,
   self-denial, new obedience or holiness? Luke xiii. 5, Except ye repent,
   ye shall all likewise perish.' Mortification: Rom. viii. 13, If ye live
   after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify
   the deeds of the body, ye shall live.' Self-denial: Luke xiv. 26, If
   any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, yea, and his
   own life also, he cannot be my disciple.' New obedience or holiness:
   Heb. xii. 14, Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no
   man shall see the Lord.' I answer All truths are not delivered in one
   place, and therefore a solitary faith will not bring us to heaven, but
   that which is seconded with other things. But more distinctly:--

   1. Faith is not required to exclude other things that are connexed with
   it by the ordination of God. For every one that believeth Christ,
   believeth the whole gospel to be true. Except against one part and you
   may except against all the rest. Now it is evident in the gospel that
   without regeneration, repentance, and holiness, no man can be saved and
   see God; therefore every one that believeth in Christ must trust him to
   obtain it in the way that he hath appointed and promised to give it.

   2. Faith is not required to exclude other things that are included in
   the nature of it, or flow as genuine effects from such a cause. A
   purpose of obedience is included in the nature of faith, and actual
   obedience is the fruit of it. Every one that believeth Christ receiveth
   him in all his offices; therefore a purpose of obedience is included in
   the nature of it; and if faith be sincere, universal obedience in
   self-denial, mortification, and our duty to God and men, will naturally
   be derived from it. Therefore, as he that is to entertain a king makes
   reckoning of his train, and that he will not come alone, so every one
   of whom faith in Jesus Christ is required must reckon that his faith
   must be evidenced to be sincere by the fruits of it.

   III. Why is faith required, that we may receive benefit by Christ?

   For these reasons;--(1.) In respect of God; (2.) In respect of Christ;
   (3.) In respect of the creature; (4.) In respect of our comforts.

   1. In respect of God, that our hearts may be possessed with a full
   apprehension of his grace, who in the new covenant appeareth not as a
   revenging and condemning God, but as a pardoning God. This reason is
   rendered by the apostle, Rom. iv. 16, It is of faith, that it might be
   of grace.' The law brought in the terror of God, by being the
   instrument of revealing sin, and the punishment due thereunto: ver. 15,
   The law worketh wrath, for where there is no law there is no
   transgression,' no such stinging sense of it; but the gospel brought in
   grace. The law stated the breach, but the gospel showed the way of our
   recovery. And therefore faith doth more agree with grace, as it makes
   God more amiable and lovely to us, and beloved by us, by the discovery
   of his goodness and grace. The saving of man by Christ, that is, by his
   incarnation, life, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension, do
   all tend to possess our hearts with his abundant grace. To the same
   tend also his merciful covenant, gracious promises, and all the
   benefits given to us; his Spirit, pardon, and communion with God in
   glory, all is to fill our hearts with a sense of the love of God. And
   all this is no more than necessary; for a guilty conscience is not
   easily settled, and brought to look for all kind of happiness from one
   whom we have so much wronged. Adam, when once a sinner, was shy of God,
   Gen. iii. 30; and sin still makes us hang from him. Guilt is
   suspicious, and if we have not one to lead us by the hand, and bring us
   to God, we cannot abide his presence. For this end serveth faith; that
   sinners, being possessed of the goodness and grace of God, may be
   recovered and return to him by a fit means. In the new covenant,
   repentance more distinctly respects God, and faith respecteth Christ:
   Acts xx. 21 , Repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus
   Christ.' Repentance respects God, because from God we fell, and to God
   we must return. We fell from him, as we withdrew our allegiance, and
   sought our happiness elsewhere; to him we return, as our rightful and
   proper happiness; but faith respects the Mediator, who is the only
   remedy of our misery, and the means of our eternal blessedness. He
   opened the way to God by his merit and satisfaction, and actually
   bringeth us into this way by his renewing and reconciling grace, that
   we may be in a capacity both to please and enjoy God; and that is the
   reason why faith in Christ is so much insisted on, as our title and
   claim to the blessedness of the new covenant. It hath a special
   aptitude and fitness for our recovery from sin to God, because it
   peculiarly respects the Mediator by whom we come to him.

   2. With respect to Christ.

   [1.] Because the whole dispensation of grace by Christ cannot well be
   apprehended by anything but faith; partly because the way of our
   recovery is so supernatural, strange, and wonderful, that unless we
   believe God's testimony, how can we be persuaded of it? That the
   carpenter's son should be the Son of that great architect and builder
   who framed heaven and earth; that life should come to us by the death
   of another; that God should be made man, and the judge a party, and he
   that knew no sin be condemned as a criminal person; that one crucified
   should procure the salvation of the whole world, and be Lord of life
   and death, and have such power over all flesh as to give eternal life
   to whom he will;--reason is puzzled at these things; faith can only
   unravel them. Partly because the comfort of the promises is so rich and
   glorious, and the persons upon whom it is bestowed so unworthy, that it
   cannot easily enter into the heart of a man that God will be so good
   and gracious to us: 1 Cor. ii. 9, Eye hath not seen, ear hath not
   heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the
   things God hath prepared for them that love him.' Therefore, sense and
   reason could look for no such thing. Faith is necessary, and a strong
   faith, that it may work upon us. These are things which we could
   neither imagine nor hope for. Partly because the chief of our blessings
   lie in another world, and nature cannot see so far off, 2 Peter i. 9.
   Partly because Christ's most sincere people are afflicted with so many
   difficulties, and so seemingly forsaken; and temptations to unbelief
   are many and pressing, that it is hard to maintain any life in
   ourselves unless we have faith, that is, a strong assent and invincible
   trust. Well, now, consider for what good reason God requireth faith.
   Sense only looks to things seen and felt; reason seeth effects in their
   causes, and yet but probably; but faith is a believing such things as
   God hath revealed, because he hath revealed them; and surely this only
   can sustain us in the expectation of God's grace and mercy unto eternal
   life. Whilst we are employed in duties so opposite to the bent of the
   carnal heart, and have so many temptations to the contrary, what can
   support us but a strong and lively faith?

   [2.] Till we believe in Christ, we can have no comfort or use of all
   his offices. How can we learn of him the way of salvation, till we
   believe him to be the prophet sent of God to teach the world the way to
   true happiness? Mat. xvii. 5, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased; hear ye him.' How can we obey him, unless we believe in him
   that he is our Lord, who hath power over all flesh, at whose judgment
   we must stand or fall? Acts xvii. 30, 31, Now commandeth all men
   everywhere to repent, because he hath appointed a day in which he will
   judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained,
   whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him
   from the dead.' How can we depend upon the merit of his obedience and
   sacrifice, and be comforted with his gracious promises and covenant,
   and come to God with boldness and hope of mercy in his name, and be
   confident that he will justify, sanctify, and save us, unless we
   believe that he is a priest, who once made an atonement, and
   continually makes intercession for us? Heb. ix. 25. In the days of his
   flesh, when any came for any benefit to him, he put him upon his trial,
   Believest thou that I am able to do this?' Mark ix. 23, Jesus said unto
   him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
   believeth.' Believest thou that I am able?' to Martha, John xi. 26.
   Thus they were not capable of any benefit till they believed.

   3. With respect to that holiness and obedience which God expected from
   the creature. Christ came to restore us to God, which he doth both as a
   Saviour and lawgiver to his church; and till we believe in, him, both
   these qualities and functions miss of their effect.

   [1.] As a Saviour, he came to take away the curse of the law, and to
   put us into a capacity to. serve and please God, by giving us his
   Spirit to renew our natures and heal our souls: Isa. liii. 5, The
   chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are
   healed;' 1 Peter ii. 24,. Who his own self bare our sins in his own
   body on the tree, that we, being dead unto sin, should live unto
   righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.' We shall never mind
   our duty, nor be capable to, perform it, unless we believe that he is
   such a Saviour.

   [2.] As a lawgiver, obliging us by his authority to live in obedience
   unto God. The kingdom of the Mediator is clearly subordinate to the
   kingdom of God; for he came not to vacate our duty, but to establish
   it; he came to restore the lost groat to the owner, the lost sheep to
   the possessor, the lost son to the father. As the grace of Christ doth
   not vacate the mercy of God, so the authority of Christ, that novum jus
   imperii, doth not free us from the authority of God. Now, who will
   submit to an authority that is not convinced of it, or doth not believe
   it? But when once we believe; then we bow heart and knee.

   4. With respect to our comfort. Often in scripture faith is represented
   as a quieting grace. The comfort, quietness, and peace of the soul
   dependeth much upon faith in Christ as an all-sufficient Saviour, which
   banishes our fears, and makes us in our greatest hardships to trust
   Christ with all our happiness, and to feast the soul with a constant
   peace and everlasting joy. Whether this world be turned upside down and
   be dissolved; whether we be in poverty and sickness, or in health or
   wealth; whether we be under evil repute or good; whether persecution or
   prosperity befall us, how little are we concerned in all these if we
   know in whom we have believed'? 2 Tim. i. 12. Heaven is where it was
   before, and Christ is at the right hand of God; how little then should
   all these things disturb the peace and comfort of that soul that shall
   live with God for ever? Ps. cxii. 7. But sin is our greatest trouble.
   If sin be your trouble, I answer, Is it your infirmity or iniquity? If
   infirmity, There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus,'
   &c., Rom. viii. 1. If iniquity, break off your sin by repentance, and
   then there may be comfort for you; for Christ came to save us from our
   sins.

   Use 1. Is to confute men's presumptions of their eternal good estate,
   whereby many damnably delude their own souls.

   1. Some, when they hear that whosoever believeth shall be saved, have a
   carnal notion of Christ, that if he were alive they would own him, and
   receive him into their houses, and use him more friendly than the Jews
   did. This is but a knowing Christ after the flesh,' 2 Cor. v. 16. He is
   not to be received into your houses, but into your hearts. Besides, we
   do not know our own hearts, or what we should have done if we had lived
   then; a person of such contemptible appearance as Christ was, and so
   free in his reproofs of the sins of the times, would not have been for
   our turn no more than theirs. The Jews said, Mat. xxiii. 30, If we had
   lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been guilty of the
   blood of the prophets.' The memory of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram was as
   detestable to the carnal Jews as that of Judas and Pontius Pilate to
   Christians; but they were not a whit the better men, no more are we.

   2. They do great reverence to his name and memory, profess themselves
   Christians, and abhor Turks and infidels. No; this will not do neither.
   Many prize Christ's name that neglect his office; honouring the
   physician without taking his remedies never brought health. They have
   learned to speak well of Christ by rote after others, but they do not
   savingly and sincerely believe in him to cure and heal their souls, and
   suffer him to do the work of a mediator there. The other respect is to
   be ascribed to the chance of their birth: they have the happiness to be
   born there where Christ is the God of the country; that which makes
   others Turks and infidels makes them Christians: but though they stand
   upon the higher ground, they are not the taller men.

   3. They are very willing to be forgiven by Christ, and to obtain
   eternal life; but this is what mere necessity requires them. They will
   not suffer him to do his whole work, to sanctify them, and fit them to
   live to God, nor part with their nearest and dearest lusts, and come
   into the obedience of the gospel; or at least, if Christ will do it for
   them, without their improving this grace, or using his holy means, they
   are contented. But having such precious promises,' and such a blessed
   Redeemer, we are to cleanse ourselves,' 2 Cor. vii. 1. The work is
   ours, though the grace be from him. So Gal. v. 24, They that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.'

   4. Some have a strong conceit that they shall be saved and have benefit
   by Christ. This, which they call their faith, may be the greatest
   unbelief in the world; that men living in their sins shall yet do well
   enough is to believe the flat contrary of what God had spoken in his
   word: 1 Cor. vi. 9, Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit
   the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor
   idolaters, nor drunkards, nor effeminate persons, &c., shall inherit
   the kingdom of God.' It is not strength of conceit, but the sure
   foundation of our hope, that will support us; nor are they the most
   happy who have the least trouble, but who have the least cause.

   Use 2. Do we believe in the Son of God? Here will be the great case of
   conscience for settling our eternal interest.

   1. If we believe, Christ will be precious to us: 1 Peter ii. 7, Unto
   them which believe, he is precious.' Christ cannot be accepted where he
   is not valued when other things come in competition; with him, and God
   will not be prodigal of his grace.

   2. Where there is true faith, the heart will be purified: Acts xv. 9,
   Purifying their hearts by faith.'

   3. If you do believe in Christ, the heart will be weaned from the
   world: 1 John v. 4, For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world;
   and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.'

   4. If you have the true faith, it works by love: Gal. v. 6, For in
   Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision; but faith, which worketh by love.'

   By these things will the case be determined. Then the comfort and
   sweetness of this truth falls upon your hearts, that God so loved the
   world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'

SERMON XVII.

   See, I have set before thee this day life and good, death and
   evil.--Deut. XXX. 15.

   MOSES, the man of God, having acquainted the people with the tenor of
   God's commandments, both concerning worship and civil conversation,
   doth enforce all by a pregnant exhortation, laying before their eyes
   the blessings of obedience, and the plagues and curses that should
   overtake them in case they should decline from the ways of the Lord
   thus recommended to them; in all which he showeth himself not only as
   an ordinary preacher speaking by way of exhortation and doctrinal
   threatening, but as a special prophet speaking by way of prediction,
   and that with such clearness and certainty that these few chapters may
   be looked upon as an exact calendar and prognostication, wherein the
   good or bad days of this people are expressly calculated and fore told;
   yea, comparing events with the prediction, you would rather conceive
   Moses his speech t& be an authentic register and chronicle of what is
   past than an infallible prophecy of what was to come: nothing good or
   bad hath befallen this people from the beginning to this day but what
   is here foretold. What is more largely declared upon in this
   exhortation is contracted into a narrow room and summary here in the
   text: See, I have set before thee this day life and good, death and
   evil.'

   In the words observe:--

   1. The matter propounded, in two pairs, that have a mutual connection
   one with another: life and good, death and evil.

   2. The manner of proposal: I have set before thee.

   3. A duty inferred or attention excited: see.

   1. The matter propounded, a double pair or conjugation: Life and good,
   death and evil.' Life as the end, good as the means leading to life; or
   else, life, that is, the enjoyment of God; and good, the felicity
   following it. The Septuagint changeth the order, te`n zoe`n kai` to`n
   tha'naton, to` agathon kai` kako`n.

   2. The manner of proposing: I have set before thee.' Septuagint,
   do'deka pro` proso'pou sou se'meron; that is, in a lively manner laid
   forth and offered for choice. We have a saying, antikei'mena para'llela
   ma'lista pha'inetai, that contraries put together do mutually
   illustrate each other. Here is good and evil, life and death, put
   together, that we may embrace the one and eschew the other. As the
   poets feign of Hercules when he was young, virtue and vice came to woo
   and make court to him; virtue, like a sober chaste virgin, offering him
   labours with praise and renown; vice, like a painted harlot, wooing him
   with the blandishments of pleasure. So, in the 9th of Proverbs, wisdom
   and folly are represented both pleading to draw in the hearts of men to
   them: ver. 4, compared with the 16th, Whoso is simple, let him turn in
   hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith, Come, eat of
   my bread and drink of the wine that I have mingled;' the one hath her
   pleasures and the other hath her pleasures, only the pleasures of folly
   are stolen waters' and bread eaten in secret,' comforts we get by
   stealth, jollity, and mirth, when conscience is asleep. So here Moses
   layeth before them the fruit of obedience--and disobedience life and
   death.

   3. The word exciting attention: idou, See;' I have done this in order
   to choice; for so it is ver. 19, Choose life, that both thou and thy
   seed may live.'

   Doct. It is the duty of the faithful servants of the Lord in a lively
   manner to set before the people life and death as the fruit of good and
   evil.

   Moses was God's minister to instruct this people, and what doth he
   propose and confirm in his doctrine, but life and death, good and evil?
   and this was a part of his faithfulness. Witness that vehement
   obtestation used ver. 19. He calls heaven and earth to record that he
   had faith fully discharged his duty herein. This was the course that
   God himself took with Adam in innocency. He set before him life and
   death, a blessing and a curse, the tree of life and the tree of
   knowledge, Gen. ii. 9, that he might live by the one and not perish by
   the other. God had respect to the mutability of his nature, and
   therefore restrained him by the threatening of death as a curse not to
   eat of the one, as he enjoined him to eat of the other as a pledge of
   life and blessing. This same course did Christ take in his sermons, by
   telling them of the wide gate and the strait gate, the broad and narrow
   way, much company and little, the one tending to destruction, the other
   to life, Mat. vii. 13, 14. So wisdom speaks by Solomon, Prov. viii. 35,
   36, Whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord;
   but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that
   hate me love death.' So that you see this is an excellent way to gain
   men to the holy life.

   I. Let us consider our work.

   II. The reasons why we must do so.

   I. Our work, the matter of it, and the manner in which we are to
   propound it to you.

   1. The matter: we must set before the people:--

   [l.] Life and good.

   [2.] Death and evil.

   This I shall open in these propositions:--

   First, That there is a distinction between good and evil, vice and
   virtue. He that doth not acknowledge it is unworthy the name, not only
   of a Christian, but of a man. Certainly he is unworthy the name of a
   Christian, for the whole word of God doth mete out the bounds between
   both these, and show what is forbidden and what is commanded; and
   therefore it is a defiance of Christianity to doubt of it. But he is
   also unworthy the name of a man. Nature apprehendeth that some things
   are worthy of praise, and others worthy of blame and reproof; else why
   should wicked men be offended to be taken for such as they are, and
   desire as much as possibly they can to seem better, and to cover their
   dishonest actions with a plausible appearance?

   Secondly, The matching these two, death and evil, life and good. And
   here I shall speak--(1.) Of the suitableness of the connection between
   them; (2.) The greatness of both; (3.) The certainty of both these,
   life and death, as the fruit of good and evil.

   1. The suitableness or correspondency there is between holiness and
   beatitude, sin and misery. It must needs be so, if we consider the
   wisdom, justice, holiness of God.

   [1.] The wisdom of God, which doth all things according to weight,
   measure, and number, cannot permit the disjunction of these two things,
   so closely united together as sin and punishment, grace and happiness,
   but there will bean appearance of deformity and irregularity. For if
   there be such a thing as good and evil, as bonum and malum morale, as
   reason will tell us there is; and again, if there be such a thing as
   pleasure and pain, as joy and sorrow, or that which we call bonum and
   malum naturale, as sense will tell us there is; then it is very
   agreeable to the wisdom of God that these things should be rightly
   placed and sorted; that moral evil, which is sin, should be punished
   with natural evil, which is pain and misery; that the inordinate love
   of pleasure, which is the root of sin, should be checked by a
   forethought of pain; and that moral good, which is virtue and grace,
   should end in joy and pleasure. For God is naturally inclined, as the
   creator of mankind, to make his creatures good and happy, if nothing
   hinder him from it. Well, then, we see how incongruous it is to the
   wisdom of God, who permits no dissonancy or disproportion in any of his
   administrations, to admit a separation of these natural relatives. If
   there were no other testimony of this, yet the dispositions of our own
   hearts would know it; for they are some obscure shadows of the
   properties which are in God. We have compassion on a miserable man,
   whom we esteem not deserving his misery; we are also moved with
   indignation and displeasure against one that is fortunate and
   successful, but unworthy the happiness that he enjoys. Which is an
   apparent testimony and proof that we are sensible of an excellent
   harmony and natural order between these two things, virtue and
   felicity, sin and misery; and to see them so suited doth exceedingly
   please us.

   [2.] The justice of God, as he is judge of the world, and so must and
   will do right, doth require ut bonis bene sit, et malis male--that it
   should be well with them that do well, and ill with them that do evil.
   God is naturally inclined to provide for the happiness of man, as he is
   his creator; and if there were no sin to stop the course of God's
   bounty, there would be nothing but happiness in the world. But since
   the entrance of sin into the world, men are of different sorts; some
   recover out of their estate of sin, and live holy; others wallow in
   their filthiness still. Now it is agreeable to God's general justice,
   as he is the judge of the world, to execute vengeance on the one and
   reward the other; that happiness should accompany virtue by a natural
   and inseparable dependence, and misery incessantly attend vice, Rom.
   ii. 6-8. It is true, the bond which joineth happiness and virtue
   together is not so strong, and so every way naturally evident, as that
   which joineth vice and punishment. If a person in sovereignty and
   honour does not will that moral evils be punished, it is in some sort
   to consent to them; but the condition of the creature is such that he
   ought to be holy and virtuous, though God had not positively commanded
   him; and God having so commanded, we are bound to obey his command,
   though he had not proposed the hope of a reward, inasmuch as we owe all
   to God, both because of the infinite eminence of his majesty, as
   because we hold our beings and all from him. And therefore there is a
   distinction: Rom. vi. 23, The wages of sin is death, but the gift of
   God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.' The one is wages,
   the other a gift. The promise which God maketh of remuneration, and the
   actual retribution which he performeth of the same, ought to be imputed
   only to his goodness and gratuitous liberality. Men cannot pretend any
   other right before him, from whom we hold all things, yea, our very
   being. Now, that which proceedeth of goodness seemeth not to be of so
   strait an obligation, but that he is at liberty to do, or not to do,
   especially when the transaction is between two persons, the dignity and
   authority of one of which is infinitely above the condition of the
   other, as the majesty of God is above his creature. Therefore as to
   such a reward God is free, and therefore might have enjoined holiness
   without the promise of such a recompense. But the general relation that
   is between punishment and sin, holiness and happiness, as to the
   consequence of one upon another, is agreeable to the general justice of
   God, which is a perfection necessary to him, as he is the supreme
   governor and ruler of the world.

   [3.] The holiness and purity of God, which inclineth him to hate evil
   and love that which is good. God, excelling in holiness himself, loveth
   the virtue and holiness of his creature, Prov. xi. 20; for how can he
   be imagined but to love his own image? And as goodness and holiness are
   loved by him, so he hateth the workers of iniquity,' Ps. v. 5, and
   abhorreth those that despise that which is most glorious in himself,
   his holiness. And then, if God loveth the good and hateth the evil, he
   will express this in answerable effects, good with life, and evil with
   death.

   In short, the difference between good and evil is not more naturally
   known, than it is naturally known that the one is to be punished, the
   other rewarded: whether we consider the wisdom of God, which sorteth
   and joins all things according to their natural order,--and therefore
   sin, which is a moral evil, is joined with sufferings, a natural evil,
   that is, a feeling of something painful to nature, and afflictive to
   it; or the justice of God, which dealeth differently with men that
   differ in themselves; or the holiness of God, who therefore will
   express his love to the good in making them happy, and his detestation
   of the wicked in the misery of their punishment.

   2. The greatness of both these,--life and death; they are both eternal.
   Punishment in one scale holdeth conformity with the reward in the
   other. The full reward is an eternal and far more exceeding weight of
   glory,' called everlasting life; so is the full punishment, the eternal
   abode of body and soul under torments, expressed by everlasting fire.
   If we did only deal with you upon slight and cheap motives, you might
   refuse to hearken; but when we tell you of life and death eternal, you
   ought most seriously to consider:--Whatever can be hoped or feared from
   man is comparatively of little moment, because his power of doing good
   or evil is limited; but on the one side, It is a dreadful thing to fall
   into the hands of the living God,' Heb. x. 31; on the other side, Rom.
   v. 2, We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God,' God will act like
   himself, infinitely gloriously, especially when he is all in all,' when
   he doth not act by the mediation of the creatures, but immediately
   punishing the wicked and rewarding the good. The vessel can convey no
   more than it receiveth. When the creature is an instrument of
   vengeance, God acteth according to the proportion and rate of that
   creature; as if a giant should strike one with a straw. If God doth us
   good by an ordinance, the water runneth but as the pipe will contain;
   he cannot manifest himself in that latitude, but then God is all
   himself immediately. Consider:--

   [1.] The greatness of the death that accompanieth evil. The afflictions
   and sorrows of this life are a part of this death. When Moses here had
   insisted on many temporal plagues which should befall his people, he
   saith, I have set life and death before you.' There are many miseries
   in this life which are the fruit of sin, which would make your hearts
   ache and your ears tingle to hear of. And then death, which consists in
   the separation of the soul from the body, is the king of terrors. But
   we speak of the second death, which is far more terrible, which
   consists in an eternal separation from the blessed and glorious
   presence of the Lord; no death like this. In all creatures that have
   sense, death is accompanied with pain; but this is a perpetual living
   to deadly pain and torment, from whence there can be no release. In the
   first death, the pain may lie in one place, but in the second it
   extends all over. The first death, the more it prevaileth the more we
   are past feeling; but in this death the sufferer has a greater vivacity
   than ever, the capacity of every sense is enlarged, and made more
   receptive of pain. While we are in the body, vehemens sensibile
   corrumpit sensum--the more vehemently and violently any thing strikes
   upon the senses, the more doth it dead the sense; as the inhabitants
   about the fall of Nilus are deaf with the continual noise. Too much
   light puts out the eyes; taste is dulled by custom. But here the
   capacity is improved by feeling. The power of God sustains the sinner,
   whilst his wrath torments him. As the saints are prepared for the
   blessedness of heaven, we cannot bear the least glimpse of that
   happiness which they enjoy above; so the wicked are fitted to endure
   those inconceivable pains. When the first death approaches, there is
   struggling for life, men would not die; but in the second death they
   desire a final destruction, they would not live.

   [2.] The greatness and excellency of that life that ensueth good. All
   manner of blessings in this life is the lowest step of it. At death,
   when the spirit returneth to God that gave it, then it beginneth to be
   discovered, but it is consummated when body and soul shall be
   translated to heaven. This is life indeed. Nescio an ista vita,
   mortalis vita, an vitalis mors, dicenda sit--the present life is a kind
   of death, always in fluxu; like a stream, it runneth from us as fast as
   it cometh to us: Job xiv. 2, He fleeth away as a shadow, and continueth
   not.' We die as fast as we live, like the shadow of a star in a flowing
   stream. This life is annoyed with a thousand sorrows and calamities;
   but there is a freedom from all sin and misery, and a full fruition of
   pleasures for evermore, Ps. xvi. 11, and our capacities are strong to
   bear them. This life is patched up with supplies from the creatures,
   there is a full fruition of God himself, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. And in this
   life such days may come wherein we have no pleasure,' Eccles. xii. 1.
   Life itself becomes a burthen; but that life, as it lasteth for ever,
   so we are never weary of it. The enjoyment of God is new and fresh to
   us every moment. As the angels for thousands of years are beholding the
   face of God, but never weary of so doing, so shall we always delight
   ourselves in seeing God as he is.

   3. The certainty of both these, life and death, hell and heaven, as the
   fruits of good and evil.

   [1.] Reason showeth it certainly that there is eternal life and death,
   or a state of torment and bliss after this life. All men are persuaded
   that there is a God, and very few have doubted but that he is a
   rewarder of virtue and a punisher of vice. Now, neither the one nor the
   other is fully accomplished in this world, even in the judgment of
   those that have no great knowledge of the nature of sin, nor what
   punishment is competent thereto. Therefore there must be after the
   sojourning in the body a time in which retributive justice shall be
   executed, and punishments and rewards that here are dispensed so
   disproportionably, even to what natural reason would expect from the
   hand of God, shall most equally be dispensed to persons. If any say
   virtue is a reward to itself, as in some sense it is, yet the full
   reward lieth in another world, and the main encouragements must be
   fetched from thence. There is an opposite principle against it in the
   heart, which must always be curbed and suppressed, and it meeteth with
   many temptations from the reproaches and oppositions of those who like
   not this sort of life. The sensual and ungodly will use all ways and
   means to brand the holy and heavenly as an humorous sort of men; and if
   their hands be tied by the restraint of laws and government, so that we
   are not exposed to sufferings by their violence, yet we cannot but
   expect slanderous abuses from them. Now, the case being so, the motives
   must be sufficient to resist all the temptations of this life, to keep
   us in the love and obedience of God to the end, which the bare sense of
   our duty would hardly do in the midst of so many temptations. We are in
   a state of imperfection, and sense is very strong in us all , and the
   sufferings of the obedient are very great, that if we had not an eye to
   the recompense of the reward, we could not so well deny ourselves. Let
   every man consult his own soul, what would support him when all the
   world is against him, and he is hooted by the clamours of the wicked
   rabble, and pursued with sharp laws, and exposed to great difficulties
   and hardships; if he had no life to live but this, what would he do?
   Besides, it will not stand with the goodness of God, if you can suppose
   one that loves goodness for goodness' sake, and is so hardy as to
   contemn all his natural interests, that such a man should be a loser by
   his faithfulness and obedience to God, and be made altogether miserable
   by his duty without recompense, 1 Cor. xv. 19. And upon another account
   his goodness is engaged to take his servants into his own blessed
   presence; for the prevailing inclination of holiness, that is planted
   by his own hand in their breath, to love, serve, and see him, is an
   earnest that we shall not always be thus imperfect; for our reward
   consisteth, as of complete felicity, so exact holiness, seeing God, and
   being like unto him: 1 John iii. 2, We know that when he shall appear,
   we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.' But suppose this
   were true, that virtue were a reward to itself, then what provision is
   there made for the punishment of vice? Cannot it be said, that they
   that addict themselves to that course of life are punished enough by
   doing so? Alas! wicked men profess great contentment in that course of
   life which they lead, and would be glad of the news that they should
   have no other punishment than to wallow in their lusts. Nature teacheth
   us, and the practice of all nations confirmeth it, that evils which
   consist in a breach of duty must be punished with afflictive evils
   painful to nature. Never such a lawgiver was heard of that would punish
   a man for robbery by causing him to commit adultery. And for virtue,
   though it hath a beauty to draw our love, yet it cannot itself be its
   own price and recompense, for man is of such a nature as he is still
   drawn on with the hope of some further good, till he come to the
   enjoyment of the chiefest good. And so many are the trials of the
   righteous in this world, that the apostle telleth us We were of all men
   most miserable, if our hopes were only in this life,' 1 Cor. xv. 19.
   The calamities of the good are as great a discouragement and offence as
   the prosperity of the wicked, therefore there is an estate of life and
   death to come. Besides, if man be God's subject, employed by him in a
   course of duty and service, when his work is ended then must he look to
   receive his wages, accordingly as he performed his duty or faulted in
   it. Now our work is not ended till this life be over; then God dealeth
   with us by way of recompense either in pains or joys. Add further,
   reason will tell us that these pains and joys after death should be
   everlasting, that the recompense should last as long as man lasts. For
   man as to his soul is immortal, and there is no change of estate in the
   other world after our trial is over, and things of religion become mere
   matter of sense. Certainly one that hath lived holily, and is
   translated to glory, there is no reason that he should afterwards be
   made miserable; and the punishment holdeth conformity to the reward:
   Luke xvi. 26, Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that
   they which would pass from hence to you cannot, neither can they pass
   to us that would come from thence.' There is no changing of estates or
   places in the other world, the blessedness and misery is eternal.
   Things to come would not considerably counterbalance things present, if
   there were not eternity in the case.

   [2.] Conscience hath a sense of it, and on the one hand standeth in
   dread of eternal death, and on the other is cheered with the hopes of
   eternal life. The first is proved Rom. i. 32, Heb. ii. 14, and 1 Cor.
   xv. 56. Men are afraid of death, not only as a natural evil, as it puts
   an end to present comforts, but as it is an entrance to an unknown
   country. What is the reason of the stings of conscience, which are
   never so sensible and quick as when men approach near death, or behold
   themselves in some near danger? What are these but presaging fears that
   anticipate miseries after this life? If the soul were extinguished with
   the body, then troubles should in reason vanish; but we find that this
   is the time when these alarms are redoubled, and these tempests
   increase with violence. On the other side, there are joys of the Spirit
   which are a taste and earnest of eternal life: Eph. i. 13, He hath
   given us the earnest of the inheritance,' Good men have so much of
   heaven upon earth as may assure them they may look for more; this hath
   supported them in all their difficulties and labour. Now if there was
   no such thing, the wise and best men that ever the world saw would be
   liars or fools; liars in pretending comfort which they had not, or
   fools in being deceived by their own vain imagination, and in taking
   such pains in subduing the flesh, hazarding their interests, and
   performing their duty upon the hopes of another world.

   [3.] Scripture, if we will take God's word for it, is express, Rom.
   viii. 13, Rom. vi. 21, 22, and Gal. vi. 8. The present world is
   comprised in two ranks--either sowing with the flesh, that is, such who
   employ their labour to make provision to gratify the carnal appetite,
   or sowing to the Spirit, such as employ their time and study in
   advancing the work of the Spirit; and they issue themselves into two
   states in the other world--the state of everlasting perdition or
   everlasting life. Thus do the scriptures propound good and life, evil
   and death.

   Secondly, The manner how this is to be done. It must be set forth with
   all evidence and conviction as to the reason of men, with all
   earnestness and affectionate importunity to awaken their affections. In
   short:--

   1. So as will become the belief of these things. We must not speak of
   them as a thing spoken in jest and by rote, but as firmly persuaded of
   the truth of things as if heaven and hell were before our eyes, and as
   evident to sense, Heb. xi. 1. We look upon these things naturally as at
   a distance, and so have but a cold apprehension of them; but we should
   by faith see them as near at hand; as you would pull a man out of the
   fire, Jude 23, or as falling into a deep pit or bottomless gulf; as one
   in the greatest earnest. Belief puts a life into truths which otherwise
   are but dead and weak in their operation: I believed, and therefore did
   I speak;' as if we had a deep sense of these things upon our own
   hearts.

   2. As will become experience: 2 Cor. v. 11, Knowing the terrors of the
   Lord, we persuade men.' A man that knoweth the terrors of the Lord,
   that hath been scorched himself, will set them before men as if they
   were at hand, ready to surprise them. Others that talk of these things
   but as cold opinions, they will not be so careful to rouse up men to
   mind the case of their souls: If one went unto them from the dead, then
   will they repent,' Luke xvi. 30.

   3. So as will become zeal for the glory of God, which is much promoted
   by the subjection and obedience of his creatures, and his interest in
   them; therefore we should be diligent and industrious in drawing souls
   to Christ: Col. i. 27, 28, Christ in you, the hope of glory; whom we
   preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that
   we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.' 2 Cor. xi. 13, They
   have blind, unbelieving hearts, therefore need to be taught; cold
   careless affections, and need to be warned; [23] and this with the
   greatest wisdom that can be used, that all may be presented to Christ
   at the last day. This is that which sets all agoing. When we are wooing
   for Christ we should not do it coldly and triflingly, but as those that
   would prevail for their master, that he may be glorified in their being
   gained to him.

   4. So as will become compassioners of precious and immortal souls, for
   whom Christ died, souls that must live for ever in heaven or hell. Oh,
   mind them of their duty, warn them of their danger; they are ready to
   tumble into the flames of hell every moment, therefore with all
   earnestness set life and death before them. We should use the more
   compassion to souls, because God himself, who hath employed us, hath
   expressed so much of his compassion. He doth not only tell them they
   will die, but expostulated with them, Why will you die, house of
   Israel?' Ezek. xxxiii. 11; and Ezek. xviii. 23, Have I any pleasure at
   all that the wicked should die, and not return from his ways and live?'
   The greatest quarrel Christ hath with sinners is be cause they will not
   come to him for life: John v. 40, Ye will not come to me that ye might
   have life.'

   Two reasons make this more evident:--

   1. This is God's will.

   2. This is of great profit to the souls of men.

   First, This is God's will, that his law should be propounded with the
   sanction of it; that is, with penalties and rewards. God might rule us
   with a rod of iron, require duty out of mere sovereignty; but he will
   draw us with the cords of a man.' Hosea. xi. 4, with such arguments as
   are fitted to man's temper, as he is a reasonable creature; that is, by
   promises and threatenings. We are best moved and induced to any thing
   by those two affections of fear and hope; the one affection serveth for
   aversion and flight, the other for choice and pursuit. Therefore he
   that knoweth the wards of the lock accordingly suiteth the keys, and
   doth not only require an exact duty, but also promiseth good and
   threateneth evil. Sovereigns, in their public edicts, do not argue with
   their subjects, but only interpose their authority; but God
   condescendeth to reason with his creatures. He doth not say, as some
   times, Thus shall ye do, I am the Lord; but, If you do thus, this will
   be your ruin; and Obey these statutes for your good,' Deut. vi. 24; and
   so doth persuade as well as command.

   Secondly, It is of great profit to the souls of men.

   1. It is of profit that they should often be minded of the issues of
   things. Israel's want of wisdom cometh from this: Deut. xxxii. 29, Oh,
   that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end;' that is, how obedience and disobedience
   will succeed with them, Lam. i. 9. David's trouble at the prosperity of
   the wicked arose from want of this: Ps. lxxiii. 17, Then I understood
   their end.' Rom. vi. 21, The end of these things is death.' Fugientes
   respice, what will they leave in their farewell and departure?--Jer.
   xvii. 11, At his latter end he shall be a fool.' The first addresses of
   sin smile upon us, but the sting is in the tail.' So the beginning of
   godliness is bitter, but afterward it yieldeth everlasting peace and
   comfort.

   2. That they may reflect on both combined: either of them single is of
   great force, but both joined together come in upon the heart with
   greater power. We need a bridle and a spur; a bridle because of our
   proneness to evil, and a spur because of our backwardness to good. We
   have both, we are compassed and hedged in with our duty on. every side.
   If we look back, there is death to affright us; if forward, heaven to
   allure us. There is eternal life to draw us, there is eternal death to
   drive us. If God had only terrified us from sin by inexpressible pains
   and horrors, and made no promise of unspeakable joys, this were enough
   to engage us to live without blame and blemish, that we might not be
   cast into the prison of hell; or, if only to quicken our diligence, he
   had propounded hopes and happiness as the privilege of those that live
   virtuously and holily, and evil men did utterly perish when they die,
   this were enough to draw us. If God had only promised heaven and no
   hell, there would not be so strong a motive; but can we be cold and
   dead when both life and death are laid before us, and both for ever?
   This is very unreasonable. Solomon telleth us,. Prov. xv. 24, That the
   way of life is above to the wise, to avoid hell beneath.' Every step
   they tread is a going from eternal death, and an approach to eternal
   life. Therefore, as we would escape the torments of hell, and possess
   the joys of heaven, we should be serious. We are undone for ever if we
   be not blessed for ever; and the nearer we draw to the one, the more we
   avoid the other; so that we have a double reason not to go back, and
   much to engage us to go forward.

APPLICATION.

   Use of exhortation.

   1. Suffer us to discharge our duty in, this kind:, Heb. xiii. 22, I
   beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation.' It is but a
   small request we have to you, that you will but suffer us to take pains
   to save your souls. It is irksome to carnal men to have their
   sluggishness stirred up; but what is there that should make it grievous
   and distasteful? Many can endure us when we treat of the joys of
   heaven, but when we come to flash hell terrors in the face of obstinate
   sinners, and tell them of damnation and wrath to come, they think us
   harsh and severe, and say, as Ahab of Micaiah, He prophesieth nothing
   but evil to me.' Ay! but we must set both before you both life and
   death; and it is better to hear of hell than to feel it. That is a
   cowardly confidence that can not endure the mention of our danger.
   There are others that like the offer of heaven, but would sever those
   things that are so aptly joined, life and good, death and evil; that
   cannot endure this doctrine in this sense. They say, with those carnal
   hearers, Evermore give us the bread of life,' John vi. 34. But they
   mistake the terms upon which it may be had. Oh! but we are not in the
   place of God, and cannot make the way to heaven easier than it is; but
   we propound God's covenant as we find it, life and good, the conditions
   as well as the offer. Would you have us compound with you, and deceive
   your souls with a false hope, which will leave you ashamed when you
   most need the comfort of it? Men would live with the carnal, die with
   the sincere; therefore suffer us to be earnest with you.

   2. The next thing that we exhort you to is to believe the certainty,
   consider the weight and importance of these truths, that there is a
   difference between good and evil, that the fruit of the one is death,
   of the other life; and consider how irrational it is for a man to love
   death and refuse life. No man in his right wits can make a doubt which
   to choose: In vain is the snare laid in the sight of any bird,' Prov.
   i. 17. You cannot drive a dull ass into the fire that is kindled before
   his eyes. It is true you hate death, and yet it is proper to say you
   choose it: Prov. viii. 36, All they that hate me, love death.' Why,
   refusing the good, do you so eagerly pursue the evil? How can ye hate
   the wages, and yet love the work by which the wages is to be earned,
   and in requital of which it will be certainly paid? If you detest hell,
   why not sin? If you love heaven, why do you not do good? There is an
   inseparable connection between these. Who can pity the torment of that
   man that thrusts his hand into the fire? What should be the cause of
   this but incredulity and inconsideration?

   [1.] Unbelief and atheism; they do not think God will recompense men
   according to their works. Now, till men believe it, tell them of hell
   or heaven never so much, it will not work upon them. Who would lose
   that which is certain and present, for the hope or fear of that which
   is to come and doubtful, when they suspect or believe it not fully? No
   wonder they go on still in the paths that lead down to the chambers of
   death, and are prejudiced against the ways of life. But why are men
   such infidels as to future things?

   (1.) You cannot disprove what is declared in scripture, or by any sound
   argument evince that there is no heaven or hell; for all you say or
   know, there are both really existing; and if there were no more but
   that, it were good to take the surer side, especially when you part
   with nothing but a few base pleasures and carnal satisfactions. Reason
   should make us very careful. In a lottery, where there is but a
   possibility of gaining, men will venture a shilling or a small matter
   for a prize. If there be either no hell or heaven, you part with no
   more than the vain pleasures of a fading, perishing life; but if this
   doctrine prove true, you run the hazard of eternal torments, and lose
   the comfort of eternal joys; therefore it is better to trust this
   doctrine than try it. It is prudence to make provision for the worst.

   (2.) But doth not natural reason and conscience, and the presages of
   our hearts, shrewdly evidence that there is a world to come, as before
   was proved a heaven for the good, and a hell for the wicked? At present
   the wicked flourish, and the good many times suffer; what shall we
   conclude thence? Mal. ii. 17, Every one that doeth evil is good in the
   sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in him; or where is the God of
   judgment?'

   (3.) If nature be not so clear, scripture is full and positive. If we
   do indeed believe the scripture, as we profess to do, certainly we can
   not so grossly go against the whole current and drift of it. That
   scripture which you profess to be the book of God, and take for the
   rule of your lives and expectations; that scripture which your
   consciences dread as owning the voice of God therein; that scripture
   which is confirmed by God's providence and frequent experiments; that
   scripture which hath such a rational evidence in itself,--it is that
   assureth us of a world to come, and bringeth it to light in the word.
   The very thought of such a hell and heaven as were invented by the
   ancient heathens, was enough to make them virtuous; though as to the
   manner and circumstances of it, the more understanding knew it to be a
   very fable and supposition: yet the thing itself, being bottomed and
   founded upon those natural apprehensions of the immortality of the
   soul, and the attributes of the deity, had powerful effects upon them.
   Now shall we talk of Christianity, pretend a reverence for the
   scriptures, and shall we tremble no more at the certainty of a hell
   than Gentiles at the possibility of it? Shall their suspicion work more
   than our faith? If they were so pliable to poets' discipline, how
   should we be moulded and framed by the doctrine of Christ? What awe and
   holy trembling should it breed in our hearts!

   [2.] Inconsideration. We are so taken up with the cares and pleasures
   of the present life, that we are not at leisure to think of death and
   life, hell and heaven, or upon what terms we stand with God: Jer. viii.
   6; Eccles. xi. 9, Remember that for all these things God will bring
   thee to judgment.' The young man in the heat of his lusts forgetteth
   that a time of reckoning will come. Oh, think of your ways, and whither
   you are a-going. It is foolish to busy ourselves about many things, and
   neglect the main: Luke x. 41, 42. You think it will bring a damp on
   your hearts. But if you cannot endure to think of hell, how much less
   will you endure one day to suffer it? Is it such a trouble to consider
   it?--what is it to feel it? Timely consideration is the way to prevent
   and escape these torments; it will help to preserve you from coming
   thither, and cause it to work upon you. Oh, then, Set your hearts unto
   all these words which I testify among you this day,' Deut. xxxii. 46.
   Consideration will awaken the soul that was formerly laid asleep. Will
   heaven or hell entice or deter the man that thinketh not of it? Shall
   we not, therefore, have a little patience while we deeply ponder and
   weigh these things in our minds? See, life and death is set before you;
   and will you not allow a few serious thoughts about them, nor ask your
   souls what shall become of you to all eternity? God's great complaint
   of Israel is: Isa, i. 3, My people will not consider;' and the same
   complaint may be made of us. Things are evident and clear to faith,
   reason, and conscience; but we will not consider, and so wander out of
   the way.

   3. The next thing we exhort you to do, is to make choice for your own
   souls. That is the use Moses makes of it: Deut. xxx. 19, Therefore
   choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.' Hearing, believing,
   considering, are all in order to choice; and without choice, and a
   determined, fixed, bent of heart, you will never walk evenly in
   heaven's ways. Determine not only that you must, but you will, walk in
   the way which God hath set forth for you. God's ways must be chosen:
   Ps. cxix. 30, I have chosen the way of truth;' and ver. 173, I have
   chosen thy precepts;' Josh. xxiv. 15, If it seem evil to you to serve
   the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve.' Not as if it were
   indifferent, but to set an edge upon their appetite. There is much
   strength in the bond, when a man bindeth. himself freely, and makes him
   the more inexcusable if he doth not ob serve it. All will choose life
   before death, but they are out in the means; they do not choose good
   before evil, the good of holiness before the evil of sin. Every man
   desireth some good. It is as natural for the reasonable creature to
   desire to be happy, as it is for the fire to burn; but we do not make a
   right choice of the means that may bring us to that happiness that we
   desire. They would be happy, but they choose means quite contrary to
   happiness. Oh, then, choose the ways of God; let life be your motive,
   and holiness your choice. This is the way to live for ever, to avoid
   hell beneath. As soon as we come to years of discretion, we should make
   our choice to go on in the ways of life. To this we are obliged by the
   most weighty reasons, urged by the enforcements of the word, and by the
   sad and numerous examples of young people, who make an ill choice in
   the beginning, and go on, and are hardened therein, and perish for
   ever.

SERMON XVIII.

   Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
   ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.--Mat. VII.
   12.

   IT is a general complaint of the world that Christians are defective in
   the duties of the second table. Some hypocrites may be so, to mask over
   a dishonest life with a pretence of worship and godliness; but we are
   not to judge of the rest of the people of God by these, no more than we
   would judge of the glory of a street by the filthiness of the sink or
   canal, or of the sound grapes in the cluster by the rotten ones. For
   certainly all that have truly submitted to Christianity do find that
   religion doth influence their relations, and run out and issue itself
   in all the duties which they owe to man as well as unto God. And it was
   not a boast which Austin said to the heathens, Let all the religions of
   the world produce such princes, such subjects, such husbands, wives,
   parents, children, as the Christian religion produceth.' This was the
   glory of religion then, and it should not fall in our hands. Or
   possibly this may be the cause of it, unrenewed men which allow one
   another in their excesses, and glory in some kind of mutual civilities,
   may equal or overpass the godly therein. Look, as dogs excel men in the
   acuteness of smell, and the eagle in sharpness of sight, and many other
   beasts in other senses, because it is their excellency, so there are
   certain lower respects which the men of the world mutually pay one
   towards another, and they may excel in these as their peculiar worth.

   But, however, be that complaint true or false, it concerns us to take
   notice of it, and to prevent all suspicion of this kind. And therefore
   we need to press moralities upon Christians, and that from the true
   root, the love of God; for that is the great mistake of this age, to
   set up a sort of false morality, and forget the true one that is built
   on faith in Christ and love to God.

   Now, to set down each particular duty would be tedious. The life of man
   is short, and the law in all its necessary explications long and
   voluminous; and therefore to have a sure rule, and a short one, would
   be a very great advantage to us in this matter.

   And this one direction which I have read to you out of the word of God
   will serve instead of all. It is a sure rule, for Christ gives it us,
   who is truth itself; and though it be short, it is full enough for our
   purpose, for here is the substance and quintessence of the law and
   prophets, all drawn into one compendious rule and abridgment of our
   duty, the best epitome that ever was. A sentence this is of such
   weight, that the Emperor Severus (as Lactantius reporteth out of
   Lampridius) was so taken with it, that, having heard it from some Jew
   or Christian, he wrote it in his palace, and caused it to be engraven
   in golden letters in the courts of justice, and to be proclaimed at the
   punishment of offenders. And therefore I shall briefly discourse of
   this rule, and present it to your serious consideration.

   In the words there is:--

   I. A rule of life: whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye
   even so to them.

   II. The commendation of it: for this is the law and the prophets.

   III. The illative particle: therefore.

   My business shall be to open these circumstances.

   I. Here is the rule of life. This general precept may be considered in
   the affirmative or in the negative (for negatives are included in their
   affirmatives). The affirmative is in the text, All those things that
   you would men should do unto you;' the negative is in that noted
   saying, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris--that which you
   would not have done to you, do not you to them. The one, the negative,
   conduceth to restrain injury; but the other, the affirmative, urgeth us
   to do good. The negative enforceth justice and equity in us to others;
   the affirmative, love and charity. Heathens by the light of nature were
   more sensible of negatives, that they should not hurt others in their
   body, goods, or good name, as we would not in either of these things be
   wronged ourselves; therefore Christ, passing that, layeth down the
   affirmative, of which nature is less sensible, of doing good to them,
   as we desire they should do to us in our extremities.

   But because one cannot well be handled without the other, I shall begin
   with the negative consideration, which concerns right and justice to
   the persons, names, goods, and possessions of others. We are earnest to
   have fair dealing from others; we should be as earnest to yield the
   same again. There is no man but hath a quick sense of injuries done to
   himself. When we are wronged by lying, slandering, oppression, or by
   fraudulent bargain^ how will we discourse of equity, and plead for
   right upon these occasions? Why, the like tender respect, the like
   sense, should we have in our dealing with others; a8 you would not
   others should defame, oppress, or overreach you, so should not you do
   to them. In other men's dealings with us we are masters, acute
   discerners of. right in our own case, able to teach what men ought to
   do; but in our dealing with others we are scarce scholars. We would be
   reverenced, commended, fairly used, have others tender of our credit;
   and if we be abused' in, person, disgraced in speech, endamaged in
   goods or good name, we complain of the wrong. Therefore it was well
   said of Calvin, that it would be much better for mankind if we were as
   faithful learners of active duties as we are acute doctors concerning
   passives; that is, that we would not offer such usage to others as we
   would not be well pleased with ourselves, but give as we would receive.

   To impress the rule upon, you, I shall give four considerations in the
   negative sense.

   1. That in the duties of the second table we have more light than we
   have in the first; for when Christ sets forth the sum of both the
   tables, Mat. xxii. 36, 37, he tells us that we must love God with all
   our hearts, our souls, our strength, .and mind;' but when he comes to
   the love of our neighbour, he gives a measure more easily discernible;
   we are to love our neighbour as ourselves.' Love will tell us what is
   good for ourselves. The love of God must be preferred both to ourselves
   and to our neighbours. And in guiding and expressing our love to God,
   we need many rules. Our desires of good to ourselves are a complete
   measure and rule of that respect we owe to our neighbours. This
   principle of self-love would show us what we owe to one another. But
   though nature discovers a God, and reason that this God should be
   worshipped, yet nature could never carve out such a worship as is
   proper to God, and as God likes; there needs a larger explication. Let
   a man be free from passion and from inordinate self-love, consider what
   he would have done to himself; this will direct him plainly what should
   be done to others that agree with us in the same common nature, and who
   have an original right with us in things that belong to justice and
   equity, and should be as fairly respected by us as we expect to be
   treated by them.

   2. The breach of this rule is more evil in him which hath experimented
   the bitterness of wrongs or misery than in another; because experience
   giveth us a truer knowledge of things than a naked idea and conception
   of them. He that knoweth things by mere contemplation, doth but know
   them at a distance, and as it were afar off; but he that knoweth things
   by experience, knows them at hand, and feels the smart of them.
   Therefore conscience should work more in them by way of restraint,
   because they know what it is to be oppressed and disgraced, and
   remember how grievous it was when they did lie under any wrong. Look,
   as it is made an argument of confidence in Christ's pity, because his
   heart was made tender by experience: he was tempted, he was
   despitefully used, he experimented all our sorrows; therefore he is
   able'--that is, has a greater fitness--to succour those which are
   tempted,' Heb. ii. 18. And in another place we read, that He learned
   obedience by the things which he suffered,' Heb. v. 8. Did Christ learn
   anything better, or improve his knowledge, which had the Spirit without
   measure'? Yes, he might have an experimental learning and feeling.
   Thus, when he suffered things so regretful and contrary to that life he
   had assumed, he knew what it was to overrule the natural inclinations
   of life, and subordinate them to the will of God, and learn obedience
   by the things which he suffered, and will more compassionate when poor
   creatures are put upon duties against flesh and blood. And it is used
   as an argument why we should come to the throne of grace 1 with
   boldness: Heb. iv. 15, Because we have not an high priest which cannot
   be touched with our infirmities,' &c. He hath experimented them in his
   own person, he knows these things himself. And so Exod. xxii. 21, Thou
   shalt not vex a stranger, nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the
   land of Egypt.' The people of Israel knew what it was to be exposed to
   the envy of the natives, where they had few friends and many enemies.
   But especially observe that Lev. xix. 33, 34, for there you have this
   great law repeated: And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land,
   ye shall not vex him; but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be
   as one born amongst you, and thou shalt love him as thyself,' Mark,
   what thou wouldst have done to thyself, do to the stranger. Why?' For
   ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.' They knew how burdensome it
   was to their souls to be under the yoke, how grievous a thing
   oppression was. Now suitably it concerneth all those which have lain
   under defamation, slander, and oppression, they should be mighty tender
   and careful how they speak of others, and what they do to others. They
   which have been servants themselves, and have felt the burden of heavy
   tasks and short allowance, hard and unmerciful usage from their
   masters, they should not exact all their labours, nor deal cruelly unto
   servants when they are masters themselves; for not only the law of God,
   but their own experience, will rise up in judgment against them, and
   increase the sting of their conscience. So the drift of that parable
   would do well to be considered in these times: Mat. xviii. 33, That
   servant which had his own debt forgiven him, yet he plucked his
   fellow-servant by the throat. Shouldst thou not have had compassion on
   thy fellow-servant, as I had compassion on thee?' When we are under
   restraint, and groan for our liberty, we would fain have an opportunity
   of glorifying God. If God should hear us in these kinds, should not we
   be like affected to our fellow-servants, and not seek to hunt every
   one, that do a little dissent from us, as vermin to death, and as
   unworthy to be allowed among us? A man which is in debt, how grievous
   is it when others deal rigorously with him? Now, for him to deal so
   with others is a double crime, as being a sin against a law and against
   experience. You complain to God in the bitterness of your soul, when ye
   are under these oppressions; so will they complain against you:
   therefore it is more evil in you. The--

   3. Observation is this: That this rule is spiritual, and concerneth the
   inward man as well as the outward; not only actions, words, and
   practices (though it be said, whatsoever men do unto you), but the
   thoughts. The whole law of God is spiritual: Ps. xix. 7, The law of God
   is perfect, converting the soul;' not only guides the motions of the
   outward man, but reacheth to the workings of the heart. As is the first
   table, so is the second: for we are told, Mat. xxii. 39, The second is
   like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' How like to
   it? It is as spiritual as the first, and therefore not only what I do,
   but what I would think and purpose to do to others, is comprehended in
   it. Christ therefore speaks of adultery committed in the heart, by
   impure and wanton thoughts and desires. This rule, which concerns the
   whole second table, not only concerns the actions, but your
   dispositions and inclinations; and not only provides against hard
   speeches, and outward behaviour, but the secret grudgings in your
   hearts against others, that your affections may not be alienated from
   them. For mark, what is here, What ye would men should do to you, do
   the same to them. In other places it is, Love thy neighbour as
   thyself,' Gal. v. 14; so that all the duties and practices which
   concern the good of our neighbour, must proceed from a principle of
   love. The justice of the second table, as required of Christians, is a
   justice tempered and excited by love. Though our outward acts be never
   so pleasant, yet if love be not at the bottom of it, it is not right.
   As 1 Cor. xiii. 3, If I give all my goods to the poor, and have not
   charity, it signifieth nothing.' You will think that is excessive
   charity, to give all my goods; yea, but if it be not done with love, it
   is nothing worth, not accepted, nor rewarded by God. And so we must
   refer these words not only to the outward man, but the principle of
   love which is in the heart.

   4. Proposition: That all which, is done by virtue of this rule, must be
   done not only out of love to man, but out of love to God, and as an act
   of obedience. For when Christ gives us this direction, Whatsoever ye
   would,' &c., he doth not give it as a politic course, to establish
   peace in the world, out as a compendious rule to guide us in the duties
   of the second table. Self-love is the measure, but it is not the
   reason, ground, or principle of our actions. A measure it is, for we
   will certainly do right to ourselves; but to make it an act of
   obedience, so it is accepted of God. It is a common rule, all moral
   duties must be done as in and to the Lord; out of the love of God, fear
   of God, and obedience to his blessed majesty: therefore it is said,
   Eph. v. 21, Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.'
   That must be the great principle which swayeth us; not policy, or
   respect to our own interest, but conscience. There must be a right
   principle of motion, as well as a just action, if we will do exactly
   and according to the law of Christ. Therefore here is the great
   difference between a Christian and another man in the duties of the
   second table in his moralities; he turns second table duties into first
   table duties; it is a thing carried on throughout the whole scripture.
   Thus if he gives alms, his alms is a sacrifice; sacrifice is a duty of
   the first table, but alms is clearly a duty of the second table. So all
   his commerce (I do but instance in one for all); what he doth to men
   must be done in and to the Lord. So here in this very case, love to
   man, it is but a stream which comes from a higher fountain, and that is
   love to God. A Christian loves God first, and indeed he loves nothing
   but God, for he loves God in all his creatures. In men we love his
   natural image, but in the saints his spiritual image: 1 John iv. 21,
   This commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his
   brother also.' Our love to our ordinary brother must be excited and
   measured by our love to God; and our love to our Christian brother, our
   fellow-saints, must be from the love of God: 1 John v. 1, Every one
   that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.'
   So much for the negative part.

   Secondly, Now let us come to the affirmative part, which established
   charity; for it is not enough if we do not hurt others, but we must do
   them good. Now charity is seen in two things both in giving and
   forgiving.

   First, In giving: What you would men should do to you, do you the same
   to them.' Be as ready to do good as to receive good. A man is never in
   a right frame of spirit until he takes as much delight in doing others
   good as he would take in having good done to himself; nay, more; for
   our Lord tells us that it is a more blessed thing to give than to
   receive,' Acts xx. 35. Why a more blessed thing? Because this comes
   nearest to the nature of God, who gives all, and takes of none. And
   therefore, as we would imitate God in other things, we should in this
   also; for all God's works should leave an impression upon us; his
   election should make us choose him and his ways; his love, to love him;
   his giving should make us to give. As a child hath part for part, limb
   for limb, answerable to his father, so should a child of God answer God
   in all his moral perfections, especially in his goodness. As you come
   behind,' saith the apostle, in no gift, so do not come behind in this
   also,' 2 Cor. viii. 7. And the rule of Christ here is that which doth
   enforce this (As ye would,' &c.), do you afford to others that comfort,
   that succour, that relief in all their distresses, which you would
   desire they should afford to you if you were in the same case, and in
   the same distress? Alas! you will say, pity should be showed to a man
   by his friend; and will you be merciless, and shut tip your bowels, and
   not show this pity to others? If you were pined with hunger, and your
   children cry for bread, and you have none to give them, would you not
   complain of the hardness of their hearts which have this world's goods,
   and shut up their bowels against them, and not dispense anything to
   their necessities? Why, if you know the heart of an indigent person, it
   cannot but move you to observe this rule. And the rather, because
   usually with what measure we mete to others, it is recompensed into our
   bosoms by God's providence; for whatever need others have of us, we
   have infinitely more of God, and there will a time come when we shall
   be as destitute before God as they are before you. For instance, in a
   time of sickness, when all outward helps fail: Ps. xli. 1 , Blessed is
   he that considereth the poor; the Lord will consider him in time of
   trouble.' Why, he that is affected with another's condition as his own,
   when it is a time of trouble and distress with him, and it may be his
   brother cannot help him, then the Lord will help him, either in
   sickness or trouble of conscience; when all outward comforts are as the
   white of an egg, when the poor perplexed sinner cries, Mercy! mercy!
   the Lord will show him mercy as he did to others: Mat. v. 7, Blessed
   are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' Those that only seek to
   enrich themselves, and solace themselves with mirth and pleasure in the
   good things they have, must not expect the like promises. But those
   which have been merciful, bountiful, and ready to help others, God
   delights to show them mercy; and when they are most destitute, they
   shall find that God takes notice of this, that they were ready to
   relieve others.

   Secondly, In forgiving, the same rule holds. A necessary duty; for
   while we are here in the world, there will be weaknesses and offences,
   and we need mutually to forgive, and to take pardon. It is said, Col.
   iii. 13, Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
   have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.'
   See the same, Eph. iv. 32, Forgiving one another, as God for Christ's
   sake hath forgiven you.' Mark, he proceeds upon this principle that
   Christ layeth down: Whatsoever ye would,' &c. We are in the world and
   in the flesh, and therefore should not rigidly exact upon the failings
   of others, lest they or others deal so with us when our turn comes. We
   need pardon in this kind, for we give offence: Eccles. vii. 21, 22,
   Take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant
   curse thee; for oftentimes also thine heart knoweth that thou thyself
   likewise hast cursed others.' The meaning is, we should not be
   over-affected with others speaking ill of us, because we know we have
   spoken ill of others, and should pass it by with meekness and neglect;
   therefore the consideration of our passions and of our infirmities
   should move us to pardon. We have been, or may be as bad as they; we
   have been once, Titus iii. 3, foolish and disobedient,' led by our
   unruly appetites and desires, therefore we should show meekness to
   them. Ay, and we may be surprised again: James iii. 1, My brethren, be
   not many masters, for in many things we offend all.' Be not many
   masters, that is, severe, masterly, or supercilious, if another be
   fallen and hath offended us, for we shall receive the greater
   condemnation.

   The apostle argueth from, another argument, Col. iii. 13; and Eph. iv.
   32, Forgive others, as God hath for Christ's sake forgiven us.' There
   is no man can wrong us as much as we trespass against God; and though
   we are but as the drop of the bucket, and the small dust of the
   balance, yet our great and many sins are freely forgiven to us;
   therefore it should prevail with us freely and easily to pardon one
   another. The scripture urgeth this. Oh, when we consider Christ's
   example, how Christ hath forgiven us; when we consider the greatness of
   the wrongs which he pardons, sins that are of a scarlet and crimson
   dye, Isa. i. 18; when we consider our own baseness in comparison of
   him, Isa. xl. 22, Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
   inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;' and when we consider his
   omnipotency to right himself of the wrongs done to him, how he can cast
   body and soul into hell fire;' surely this should move us to forgive
   others. Yea, and it is not only a motive, but a rule. Forgive others,
   as God forgives us; what is that? Sincerely, not hypocritically;
   freely, not unwillingly; fully, not by halves; irrevocably, not for a
   time only; but as God forgives and casts all our sins into the depth of
   the sea, so should we forgive and pass by the sins of others.

   Christians, shall I urge another argument in this case, what need there
   is of forgiveness? Hereby a man overcometh himself, hereby he shames
   the party that did him wrong, and hereby he takes God's course to get
   the victory over the person which hath done him the wrong. Hereby he
   overcometh himself, his own nature, which thirsteth after revenge:
   Prov. xvi. 32, He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and
   he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.' He is able to
   rule himself, so it is his glory; he doth overcome that revengeful and
   froward disposition which is in his own nature. And hereby he overcomes
   and shames the party that did him wrong; there is no such way to do
   this as by forgiveness. Thus David did overcome Saul, 1 Sam. xxiv. 17,
   when David had him at an advantage and spared him, Saul said to David,
   Thou art more righteous than I.' Oh, what a victory was this, to
   overcome that fierce man's heart and reconcile him. And you keep God's
   way in overcoming him; it is God's prescribed course that you should
   thus overcome him by kindness and meekness: Rom. xii. 21, Be not
   overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

   But wherein must we express this forgiveness towards others? As to the
   wrong to be forgiven, we must consider it either as an offence against
   God, or sometimes against public laws, or as it is an offence against
   us. So far as it is an offence against God or the public laws, here we
   have not power to forgive, and punishment is due to the common good,
   Poena debetur. The Lord himself, that forgives us, and forgives for
   Christ's sake, hath secured the honour of his governing justice by
   satisfaction; and if the law requires it, we cannot intermeddle there,
   only we must pray to God earnestly for them, that is our duty, James
   iv. 15; and in some cases we may intercede with the magistrate to take
   off the penalty, and are so bound.

   This forgiveness implieth two things--a removal of an inward grudge,
   and a readiness to do all duties of love and kindness to them.

   1. A removal of an inward grudge and endeavours after private revenge:
   Lev. xix. 17-18, Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou
   shalt in anywise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him;
   thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
   people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' Thou shalt not
   bear a grudge against him, for then you hate him in your heart.

   2. There must be a readiness to do all duties of love and kindness to
   him who hath done the wrong, as God ministereth occasion and ability.
   There are many laws for this: Exod. xxiii. 4-5, If thou meet thine
   enemy's ox or ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him
   again; if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lie under his
   burthen, and wouldst forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with
   him;' Luke vi. 27, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
   bless them that curse you.' Now, so far are we bound to remit the
   private grudge because of the offence done to us, and also to take all
   occasions to do them good.

   Object. But whether may not we have recourse to the magistrate for the
   recovery of our right, and reparation of our wrongs?

   Ans. Certainly we may, provided we go not to law for trifles; for when
   we go to law for small matters, and that before infidels, the apostle
   reproves it, 1 Cor. vi. 2; and when after all lawful means and courses
   are used before, for taking away the occasion, as ver. 5, Is there not
   a wise man among you to take up the difference?' And when it is not
   with a spirit of revenge and rigour, for a Christian should show his
   moderation in all things, Phil. iv. 5, and his lenity, gentleness, and
   readiness to forgive. But if it be out of a spirit of revenge, not the
   conscience of justice, we abuse God's ordinance to our private
   passions, Rom. xiii. 3.

   Having thus explained the law, let me vindicate this rule.

   1. It seems not to be so perfect a rule. Because many desire and wish
   much evil to themselves, should they desire evil to others? As he that
   would be drunk, should he make another drunk? and he that commits
   filthiness, should he entice others? Ans. The meaning is not what we do
   in a passion, which works not the righteousness of God, but it is meant
   of a regular will; not that we do with evil desires, as that we do in
   right reason, that which you do well informed, well advised, free from
   discomposed passion; what is according to the law of nature engraven
   upon your hearts, which is most legible in our own case; what the law
   of nature would judge to be the duty of other men to do. It is not
   meant of inordinate sinful desires.

   2. But doth not this rule make all men equal, and destroy all order and
   superiority, if every man must do as he would be done unto? What, shall
   a master require of a servant no more than he will do to him? Would a
   poor man have a rich man give him relief? Should he give him no more
   than he expects back again from this poor man? No; the meaning is, that
   for that time we should suppose ourselves in the condition of servants,
   and of that poor man. You should put yourselves in their stead, and
   suppose if I were a servant, if I were poor. We should put ourselves in
   the same equality with them, and by the law of proportion the same
   things that would seem reasonable to you if you were in their condition
   you should cheerfully do to them. For instance, if I were a servant,
   and did obey, would not I judge such exaction burthensome and
   unreasonable? If I were poor, and driven to seek relief, would not 1
   judge a denial harsh? If I were a master, should not I judge such an
   offence injurious to my authority?

   3. Doth not this establish revenge and retaliation of injuries to do to
   him as he hath done to me? Ans. No, rather much to the contrary; for it
   is not what they have done to us; Christ doth not say so, but what we
   would have to be done to us that do to them. See Prov. xxiv. 29, Say
   not I will do so to him as he hath done to me; I will render to the man
   according to his work.' That is an ill reasoning within ourselves, and
   takes God's work out of his hands, whose prerogative it is to give to
   every man according to his work. The rule is not look backward, but
   forward. It doth not look to what they have done to us, but what we
   should do to them. To think to do the same would certainly break this
   rule of Christ, and make us be burthensome to others by such actions,
   and burthensome to ourselves, and so sin not only against our own
   conscience but against sense and feeling of the thing committed. Injury
   and revenge differ only in order. He that returns injury for injury
   doth but imitate the adversary; and he that imitates that which is evil
   in another sins twice, both against the law and his own conscience.

   4. If all the world were contented to observe this rule, then we should
   have a quiet world; but others are very oppressive, unjust, and very
   hard to me, this is to live by the loss, and to bring a restraint upon
   myself from which others are free. Ans. Do your duty to them though
   they do not theirs to you. Others' sins will not exempt you from the
   law of God, which is your rule, and not their actions. What ever they
   do to you, yet carry it Christianly and meekly towards them. You are
   accountable to God for your own actions, not for the actions of another
   man. Therefore if you be able to guide your own spirit to them, how
   perverse soever they be to you, you will have the comfort that you have
   endeavoured to do your duty.

   Having vindicated the rule, let me show you the grounds and the equity
   of it. What are the intrinsic grounds and reasons why Christ hath given
   such a rule to us? No question it is founded not in his bare authority,
   but in great equity. There are two grounds:--

   1. The actual equality of all men by nature.

   2. The possible equality of all men as to their condition and state of
   life.

   1. The actual equality of all men by nature: Mal. n. 10, Have we not
   all one Father? hath not one God created us?' Were we not all created
   by the same God? Ay! and mark the equality goes further; we were all
   made of one blood,' Acts xvii. 26, all descended from Adam. Unequal
   diversity of rank doth not take away identity of nature. There is a
   diversity of rank indeed. Some are high, some low, some rich, some
   poor, some governors, some governed, some teachers, and some obey; but
   we are all made of one blood. So Neh. v. 5, Our flesh is as the flesh
   of our brethren, our children as their children.' Some are highly
   advanced above others, yet the poorest creature and you is one flesh,
   and by nature hath an equal right with you; therefore it is said, Isa.
   lviii. 7, Thou shalt not hide thyself from thine own flesh.' Thy poor,
   pined, starved brother is thine own flesh.

   2. The possible equality of all men as to condition, and as to state of
   life: they are equal by nature, and it is possible they may be in the
   same state of life. You stand to-day, another is fallen; you are liable
   to the same corruption and the same calamities. To the same corruption:
   Gal. vi. 1. If any one be fallen, ye that are spiritual restore such an
   one with a spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be
   tempted.' Rigid censurers may fall into like sins or worse themselves.
   Alas! the devil is very assiduous in tempting, and the Lord permits him
   to surprise those that are severe to others. Therefore you should show
   pity and compassion to the fallen. And then as to possibility of
   calamities: Heb. xiii. 3, Remember them that are in bonds, as bound
   with them, and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in
   the body.' There is a twofold interpretation of that place. Some
   understand it of the mystical body of Christ; but I think rather it is
   meant of the body of flesh, while we are here in the present life.
   Strange changes may come before we go out of the body; they that are
   highest may be lowest. In 2 Kings iv. 13, we read of the Shunammite
   that had given harbour and entertainment to the prophet, and the
   prophet said, What is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for
   to the king, or to the captain of the host? and she answered, I dwell
   among mine own people.' She was well, and needed nothing; she was able
   to dwell at home, and to maintain herself well enough, and needed not
   the prophet to speak to the king for her; but afterwards there comes a
   great famine, and her inheritance was invaded, and she that would not
   be beholden to the prophet was beholden to Gehazi, the prophet's man.
   Compare 2 Kings iv. 13, with 2 Kings viii. 3.

   There may be great changes here in the earth, great calamities may
   befall us; therefore, since we are in the body, and since those that
   are high to-day may be low to-morrow, and you may need the like help
   from others, we must have a fellow-feeling with them. God, who is the
   great arbiter of human affairs, can pull down and set up at his
   pleasure. We have opened the rule, the first part of the text.

   II. The second part is the commendation of this rule: For this is the
   law and the prophets;' that is, this is the sum of the doctrine of God.
   The law and the prophets were the scriptures only then in force, and
   therefore the phrase is used proverbially in many places: Mat. xi. 13,
   For all the prophets and the law prophesied till John;' Luke xvi. 31,
   They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them;' Acts xxiv. 14, I
   believe all the law and the prophets have spoken.' The law and the
   prophets were all the Bible they had for that time. Now, saith Christ,
   the law was as the text, and the prophets as the comment upon the text,
   to expound and confirm the law by a larger explication.

   But you will say, Is this the whole sum of the law and the prophets?
   Are there not doctrines delivered there insisted upon concerning our
   respects to God and all the institutions of his worship; are they not
   contained in the law and prophets?

   I answer--The proposition must be understood according to the matter in
   hand. This is the law and the prophets as to all they say concerning
   our converse with men. You may have many rules in the law and the
   prophets, where they are more copiously delivered, but they all issue
   themselves into this general rule. The worship of God and duties to him
   are also established by the law and the prophets; for when our Lord had
   spoken of what we owe to God as well as to; man, he saith, Mat. xxii.
   40, On these two hang all the law and the prophets.' These are the two
   things that all the law and the prophets seek to establish--viz., love
   to God and man. But our Saviour here speaks only concerning the second
   table; what concerns that is comprised in this sentence. All that part
   of religion which is inferioris hemispherii, of the lower hemisphere of
   duty, is distilled into this quintessential extract. As in the spirits
   of things the virtue is contracted, which otherwise is largely diffused
   while it is mingled with grosser matter, so here the spirits, the
   extract of law and prophets, are all distilled as to moral matters into
   this one saying, Whatsoever you would,' &c.

   III. The third thing to be considered is the illative particle,
   therefore.' From what is this inferred? In the foregoing verses our
   Saviour speaks of audience in prayer: If ye, being evil, know how to
   give good things unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly
   Father know how to give good things to them that ask him? Therefore,
   whatsoever ye would,' &c. Christ makes many notable arguments, and
   shows that God is ready to give good things to us: Ask, and ye shall
   have,' &c. He proves it from the kindness of earthly parents to their
   children. And, now, therefore, to intimate this, that if men have their
   prayers granted, they must observe this rule; they must perform all
   duties of civil righteousness, as well as be earnest in acts of piety.
   Upon this limiting it to the audience of prayer, it plainly implies
   three things:--

   1. That God is the judge of human actions; he will take cognisance of
   this, whether you do to others as they do to you, and you shall hear of
   it in your dealing with God; that is the first and lowest thing; and
   remember, you have to do with God as much as they have to do with you.
   He shows this to bridle the excesses of those that are in power. There
   are a sort of men that think they may do anything if they can do it
   safely: Micah ii. 1, That do evil because it is in the power of their
   hand.' They eagerly prosecute their purposes and desires when they have
   power to effect them. Now a Christian should pause upon the matter, and
   consider not only what is possible to be done, but what is just and
   lawful to be done; and conscience should put a severe restraint when
   nothing else can hinder us; as Joseph said, Gen. xlii. 18, This do, and
   live; for I fear God.' He had a full advantage against them that
   wrought him so much mischief, but he had an inward principle laid up in
   his heart which begat a tenderness, I fear God.' But when men will do
   everything they are able to effect, and will do anything as far as
   their power will reach, remember you must come before God, and God can
   requite it, though they cannot. It is not conscience which governs the
   greatest part of the world, but interest. When it is not for men's
   interest, they will do no wrong; but when they have power enough to do
   what they intend, they care not how they trample upon their own
   brethren, hate and pursue them with all that is evil. It is hard to
   avoid this snare when we are in power. Men forget God and abuse their
   power, and many times, by a strange providence, they are brought to
   suffer the like hardness themselves. When we see the oppressions of the
   innocent, and things carried so perversely, we are apt to say, Lord,
   who shall call these men into question? who shall accuse them? Why, the
   sighs and groans of the oppressed before God's tribunal upon [24] all
   persons depend every moment, these will be more authentic witnesses
   than any matters of fact can be produced in a lower court.

   2. It implieth this, and it enlargeth the rule, that whatsoever usage
   we expect to meet with at God's hands, the same in some measure we
   should dispense and deal out to others. He is willing to give all,
   provided you are willing to do to others as you would be done unto. All
   the mercy and goodness we expect from him, that must sway our practice
   and conversation with men. Whatever need others have of us, the same
   need have we of God: Eph. vi. 8, Whatsoever good thing any man doth,
   the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.' So
   for other relations. In the practice of this rule Christians are to
   consider not only how they would be dealt withal by men, but with God
   himself for Christ's sake, which carrieth the precept far beyond the
   heathen latitude, and mightily enlargeth the rule. Alas! from God we
   have nothing but undeserved mercy, pardon of sins, &c. So we are to
   practise this rule, not only to those that love us, but to our enemies;
   we must show mercy to the worst for Christ's sake. Strict justice, by
   the light of nature, requires the injurious should suffer according to
   the wrong is done to me. Ay! but what do I expect from God? Therefore,
   I am to consider how God will deal with me if I am rigid, severe,
   exact, and stand upon all things to the uttermost.

   3. Another consideration which mightily enforceth the rule is, that if
   you do such things to others as you would not have them do to you, God
   will do that to you which you have done to others; for vengeance is
   his. They are not to do the same to you again, nor exact nor desire it,
   but God will. It is good to consider God's judgment, of counterpassion
   or retaliation: As thou hast done, so shall it be done to thee; thy
   reward shall return upon thine own head,' Obad. ver. 15. They that were
   pitiless, merciless to their brethren in the day of their flight from
   Jerusalem, God will pay them home in their own coin: And with what
   measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again,' Mat. vii. 1, 2;
   Gen. ix. 6, Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be
   shed.' It is not only a law what is to be done, but a rule of
   providence, what God will do. What more usual than malefactors to be
   dealt withal according to their own wickedness? There are many
   instances of this judgment of counter-passion, God doing to them what
   they have done to others.

   Adonibezek, when the people caught him and cut off his thumbs and his
   great toes, said, Threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and
   their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have
   done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and
   there he died.' Usually this is the dealing of God. The Israelites had
   their children drowned in the water by Pharaoh. What then? Pharaoh and
   all his host, within a little while, all his nobility and men of war,
   were all drowned in the water. Ahab's blood was lapped up by dogs in
   the place where they shed the blood of Naboth; and Jezebel, being more
   guilty, was devoured with dogs. Ahab only permitted this contrivance,
   but Jezebel acted it. Ahab humbled himself, therefore he was buried
   with honour; but Jezebel was entombed in the belly of dogs, and her
   flesh devoured by them. A gallows, we read, was made for Mordecai, and
   Haman was hanged on it himself. Henry the Third of France, in that very
   chamber where the massacre was contrived against the Protestants, there
   he was slain; and his brother before him, Charles the Ninth, was found
   flowing in blood in his bed, who had shed so much of the blood of God's
   saints. Judges ix. 18. 19, compared with ver. 23, 24. When the men of
   Shechem had done great injury to the house of Jerubbaal, Ye are risen
   up against my father's house, and have slain his sons, threescore and
   ten persons upon one stone.' What then? ver. 23, Then God sent an evil
   spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem
   dealt treacherously with Abimelech, that the cruelty done to the
   threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be
   laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them.' So also the
   observation of Austin is not to be passed by, upon the parable of the
   rich man; he that denied a crumb, could not find a drop to cool his
   tongue.

   But you will say, Is it so with good men also, the children of God, if
   they should break his law, doth the Lord give them according as they
   have done to others? Yes; God observes the same justice; though he doth
   pardon the eternal punishment and take it off, yet here in this world,
   as to temporals, they shall have like for like. Jacob supplanted his
   brother; he came to Isaac as the elder, the younger instead of the
   elder; and Laban brings him the elder instead of the younger, Leah
   instead of Rachel. Asa, which put the prophet into the stocks, we read
   of him that he was diseased in his feet. Nay; I shall give you greater
   instances than that. Joseph's brethren they were not flexible to their
   brother, and did not hear his cry; at length they came to Egypt upon an
   honest errand for corn in time of famine, and the man is inexorable:
   Gen. xlii. 21, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we
   saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear;
   therefore is this distress come upon us.' What was the matter? How
   comes this to work? In a storm, things at bottom we see come up to the
   top; so ever sins in trouble will bubble up, and we shall see that we
   saw not before. How come they to remember the trouble of their brother,
   for they knew not Joseph, and twenty years were past since they sold
   him? They found the man as inexorable as they had been to their
   brother. God s judgment of counter-passion sets their conscience
   a-work. A greater instance we have of Paul, that consented to the
   stoning of Stephen, and was present too at his execution; and it is
   said, They laid down their garments at Paul's feet;' and he himself
   takes notice of it with great remorse afterwards, Acts xxii. 20. Well,
   what then? after his conversion how doth God deal with Paul? Stephen
   had prayed for him too among the rest, Lord, lay it not to their
   charge;' yet God gave him some smart remembrance of his sin. When Paul
   and Barnabas had been preaching at Iconium, though Barnabas had
   irritated them as well as Paul, they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul
   Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Barnabas, who was equal
   with him in preaching, God ordered it so he was not stoned; but Paul,
   that had consented to Stephen's stoning, was stoned himself and carried
   out for dead. What need have we to be exact in observing what is
   required of us here, for the Lord by one means or other will return it
   into our bosoms. We have done that to others which we would not should
   be done to ourselves, and therefore will God do that to us which we do
   to others.

APPLICATION.

   Use 1. To inform us:--

   First, What an advantage religion is to mankind, even with regard to
   the present life. The world hath a prejudice against religion as if it
   were an ill-natured thing, and made men forget equity and humane
   respects in favourable dealings with others. But certainly there is no
   reason for this prejudice, when it doth require not only love of all in
   their several capacities, but to do to them all the good possibly we
   can, and to seek out objects to whom we may do good, and be of a
   God-like affection. Therefore, see that it be so in your profession and
   practice, that you may recover the credit of religion by this rule. If
   this were practised:--

   1. How securely and safely might we live one by another! Whence come
   all the oppressions and injuries wherewith the world aboundeth, but for
   want of love to their neighbours as themselves? How easily might we be
   brought to pardon wrongs! And how patiently would we bear the modest
   dissent of others, when their judgments are not of our size and mould!
   How far would we be off doing hurt to others, even as far as doing hurt
   to ourselves.

   2. Consider how beneficial and mutually helpful men would be to each
   other, seeking others' good as their own, and rejoicing in an other's
   welfare as their own. If the world would but consider how much of
   Christianity doth consist in loving and doing good, as if all the world
   had but one soul, one interest, it would render it very amiable to
   them. Take this rule quite away, and there is nothing so false, bad,
   cruel, that you. would not be drawn to think, or say, or do against
   your brother.

   Secondly, It informs us how much mankind is degenerated, and how few
   true Christians are in the world. Witness our injustice to the names,
   persons, and estates of others. We are very critical in determining our
   own rights and proportions, and what others owe to us. Surely we have
   all reason to allow others what they justly expect. When you are
   slandered you are passionate, and therefore should not you be tender of
   other men's names and estates? When your debts are detained, you
   complain of wrong. Should we not be as conscionable for the speedy
   payment of others? To buy with a great measure, and sell with a less,
   is an abomination to the Lord and to men. We judge things done to us
   thus and thus, and shall we be careless what we do to them?
   Uncharitableness, and want of sympathy with us in our troubles, much
   more insulting over us in our miseries, we look on with detestation;
   and shall we pursue and afflict others when we have power to do hurt?

   Use 2. Exhortation. As that emperor wrote it on the doors of his palace
   and courts of justice, so the exhortation is to press you to get this
   rule deeply graven and written upon your hearts. In all matters of
   dealing towards others, be exact; for God, that is the patron of human
   societies, observes whether you do as you would be done unto. Remember
   it is a short rule, yet sufficient; and it is a clear rule, therefore
   it should more prevail with you.

   1. It is a short rule; and yet if it were well learned and kept, it
   would save the world a great deal of mischief. Change the persons, and
   we need not many perplexing rules to guide us. If this were done to me,
   would I take it kindly? Turn the tables, put yourselves in their stead.

   2. It is a clear rule. Look, as the apostle saith of Onesimus when lie
   was converted, that he was doubly dear to Philemon, both in the flesh
   and in the Lord,' so the same say I of this rule; it is doubly dear to
   us, both by nature and grace. The light of nature binds us, and it is
   prescribed by Christ.

   [1.] If you break this rule you offer violence to an inbred principle
   of conscience. There are many talk of being Christians, yea, but get to
   be good heathens first. Never speak of higher mysteries of believing in
   Christ, and communion with Christ, while you live so contrary to the
   light of nature. What the apostle discourseth concerning the natural
   branches and the branches contrary to nature is applicable in this
   case, Rom. xi. 24; what he speaks of persons is true of doctrines: For
   if thou wert cut out of the olive-tree, which is wild by nature, and
   wert graffed, contrary to nature, into a good olive-tree; how much more
   shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own
   olive-tree?' The meaning is, if the Gentiles were taken into a covenant
   stock, how much more shall the Jews be graffed into their own stock? So
   it is true of doctrines. If the doc trines contrary to or above nature
   have brought in souls to believe in Christ and the higher mysteries of
   Christianity, certainly much more should those doctrines which are
   agreeable to our nature have a greater respect and regard by you.

   [2.] It is also prescribed by Christ. Now our Lord reasons, Luke vi.
   46, If you call me Lord and Master, why do ye not the things I say?' It
   is a mockage to call Christ Lord and Master, and disobey his commands,
   as it was for them to say, Hail, king of the Jews,' that spit upon him
   and buffeted him. Therefore, whatsoever ye would have others do to you,
   do ye the same to them;' for he hath told you and confirmed it, This is
   the law and the prophets.'

SERMON XIX.

   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.--Eph. II.
   10.

   THE apostle in the context asserteth that our whole salvation is of
   grace, not of works; he now proveth it. That which is the effect of
   salvation cannot be the cause of it. But our well-doing is the effect
   of salvation, if you take it for our first recovery to God; but if you
   take it for full salvation, or our final deliverance from all evil,
   works go before it indeed, but in a way of order, not meritorious
   influence. To think them altogether unnecessary, would too much
   depreciate and lessen their presence or concurrence; to think they
   deserve it would as much exalt them, and advance them beyond the line
   of their due worth and value. The apostle steereth a middle course
   between both extremes. They are necessary, not meritorious. They go
   before eternal life, not as a cause but a way; for they are wrought in
   us by God, and are effects of the begun salvation; so that the good
   that we do is a part of the grace that we have received, a fruit of
   regeneration: For we are his workmanship,' &c.

   In the words are two things:--

   I. The state of believers: for we, are his workmanship, created in
   Christ Jesus.

   II. The end why we are brought into this estate: unto good works,
   which, &c.

   I begin with the former, and there note:--

   1. God's efficiency: poi'ema autou, his workmanship.

   2. The manner of his efficiency: ktisthentes, created; all proceedeth
   from the infinite creating power of God.

   3. The meritorious cause: en Christo, created in Christ Jesus.

   From the whole observe:--

   Doct. That those that are renewed and recovered out of the apostasy of
   mankind, are, as it were, created anew through the power of God and
   grace of the Redeemer.

   I. Let us explain the words of the text

   II. Prove it.

   I. For explication of what is here asserted, three things must be
   explained:--

   1. Our relation to God.

   2. His way of concurrence to establish this relation.

   3. How far the mediation of Christ is concerned in this effect.

   First, Our relation to God: We are his workmanship.' We are so

   two ways;--(1.) By natural creation; (2.) By supernatural renovation.

   1. By natural creation, which giveth us some kind of interest in him,
   and hope of grace from him. As Ps. cxix. 73. Thy hands have made me and
   fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn thy commandments,'
   God is our Creator, and the end of our creation is to serve God;
   therefore he gives some kind of encouragement to ask the grace whereby
   we may serve him. But the apostle speaketh here not of the first
   creation, but

   2. Of regeneration or renovation, which is called a second or new
   creation. As 2 Cor. v. 17, If any man be in Christ, he is a new
   creature,' kai'ne kti'sis; a new creation hath passed upon him. By the
   first creation we are made men; by the second, holy men. Holiness is a
   thing of God's making; we are regenerated and sanctified by his grace,
   and made capable of doing good by his Spirit. Now this new workmanship
   bestowed on us implieth:--

   [1.] A change wrought in us, so that we are other persons than we were
   before, as if another kind of soul came to dwell in our bodies. This
   change is represented in scripture in such terms as do imply a broad
   and sensible difference between the two states--that wherein we were
   before, and that into which we are translated; such a difference as is
   between light and darkness, Eph. v. 8; life and death, 1 John iii. 14;
   the new man and the old, Eph. iv. 22, 24. We seem to be, as it were,
   creatures transformed out of beasts into men. Instead of being governed
   by sense and appetite, we are led by reason; and reason is not only put
   into dominion, but grace, which is reason sanctified, directing and
   inclining us to live unto God.

   [2.] This change is such as must amount to a new creation. There are
   some changes which go not so far, as--

   (1.) A moral change, from profaneness and gross sins to a more sober
   course of life; for there are some sins which nature discovereth, and
   may be prevented by such reasons and arguments as nature suggesteth,
   Rom. ii. 14. This may be done by ordinary discretion and advisement.
   But the new creature signifies such a change, whereby not only of
   vicious we become virtuous, but of carnal we become spiritual, John
   iii. 6. Man naturally inclineth to things pleasing to the flesh, and
   only seeketh, savoureth, and affecteth these things; but in this change
   the Spirit interposeth and maketh him spirit. Before, man only lived as
   a nobler and better-natured animal or living creature, and pleased
   himself, that is, his flesh, either in a grosser or more cleanly
   manner, being ignorant, mindless of God and another world; but new
   creatures become spirit, have a spiritual inclination, cannot content
   themselves with a happiness on this side God and heaven. Mere human
   nature can never bring men to this, but only the power of God.

   (2.) A temporary change, as to fall into a sudden religious frame,
   which is soon worn off; as Ahab's humiliation, 1 Kings xxi. 27; or
   those that howled on their beds, &c., Hosea vii. 14, frighted into a
   little religiousness in their straits and deep necessities, like ice in
   thawing weather, soft at top and hard at bottom; or those the prophet
   speaketh of, Jer. xxxiv. 15, Ye were turned to-day and had done right,
   but ye returned again and polluted my name.' They seemed to be changed
   awhile from evil to good, and then they change again from good to evil
   This will not amount to the new creature, for that is a durable thing:
   1 John iii. 9, Spe'rma me'nei, His seed remains.'

   (3.) A change of outward form, without a change of heart; as when a man
   changeth parties in religion, and from an oppressor becomes a professor
   of a stricter way. No; the scripture opposeth this to the new creature,
   Gal. vi. 15. The new creature lieth more in a new mind, new will and
   affection, than in a new form of religion. Lead is lead still, whatever
   stamp it beareth.

   (4.) A partial change. Men are altered in some things, but the old
   nature still remaineth; their religion is but like a new piece in an
   old garment; the heart is not new moulded, so as to leave an impression
   upon all our actions. The renewed are holy in all manner of
   conversation,' en pa'se anastrophe, 1 Peter i. 15; 2 Peter iii. 11; 2
   Cor. v. 17. They drive a new trade for another world, and set upon
   another work to which they were strangers before; must have new
   solaces, new comforts, new motives. The new creature is entire, not
   half new half old; but with many the heart is like a cake not turned.'

   [3.] When thus new framed and fashioned, it belongeth to God, it hath
   special relation to him, James i. 18. It must needs be so; they have
   God's nature and life. (1.) Nature, 2 Peter i. 4. They are made like
   God, bear his image and superscription; it is a curious piece of
   workmanship, in which God hath showed his wisdom, goodness, and power;
   and so they are sealed and marked out for his peculiar ones. (2.) The
   life of God, that came from him, and tendeth to him. Others are
   alienated from the life of God,' Eph, iv. 18. They recover it, 1 Pet.
   iv. 6. His spirit is a principle of life in them, so that they are
   really alive to God, and dead to sin and the world.

   [4.] This workmanship on us as new creatures far surpasseth that which
   maketh us creatures only. That came from his general goodness, this
   from his peculiar love; there it is goodness, here it is grace: 2 Tim.
   i. 9, He hath called us with an holy calling, according to his own
   purpose and grace.' Creatures are sustained by his common providence,
   but new creatures by his special care and covenant: He openeth his
   hand, and satisfieth the desire of every living thing,' Ps. cxlv, 16.
   But he especially preserveth and supplieth believers, 1 Tim. iv. 10. He
   giveth others bodily comforts; but these, soul-refreshings and
   spiritual graces, Eph. i. 3. There is vestigium, a tract or footprint
   of God in all the creation; these have his image restored in them: Eph.
   iv. 24, The new man is created after God.' Well, then, this is that we
   should look after, that we may be his workmanship made again. It is a
   woful thing to be God's workmanship by creation and not by renovation.
   It is better never to have been God's creature in the first making, if
   not his creature in the second making. Better thou hadst been a beast,
   yea, a toad or serpent, than a man; for when the beasts die, death puts
   an end to their pains and pleasures at once, but all thy comforts end
   with death, and then thy pains begin: the beasts have no remorse to
   sour their pleasures, but man hath conscience, and therefore can have
   no rest till he return to God.

   Secondly, God's way of concurrence to establish this relation. It is a
   creation. The phrase is often used: Eph. iv. 24, The new man is created
   after God.' No other hand could finish this piece of workman ship. God
   often sets it forth by this term: Isa. xliii. 7, I have created him for
   my glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.' So ver. 21, This
   people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.' So
   in other places. Now, creation is a work of omnipotency, and proper to
   God. There is a twofold creation. In the beginning God made some things
   out of nothing, and some things ex inhabili materia, out of foregoing
   matter, but such as was wholly unfit for such things as were made of
   it; as when God made Adam out of the dust of the ground, and Eve out of
   the rib of man. Take the notion in the former or latter sense, and it
   will suit with the matter in hand. (1.) We are formed anew of God, as
   it were out of a state of nothing, and get a new being and a new life.
   To this there are frequent allusions in scripture; as Rom. iv. 17, He
   calleth the things that are not as though they were;' 2 Cor. iv. 6, Who
   speaketh (Ho e'rne) light out of darkness,' he bringeth. life out of
   death, something out of nothing. Now there is such a distance between
   these two terms that the work can only be accomplished by a divine
   power. (2.) Creation out of unfit matter. We were wholly indisposed,
   averse from good, perverse resisters of it. Now, to bring us to love
   God and holiness, to restore God's lost image to us, it is a new
   forming or making of us, and must be looked upon, not as a low,
   natural, or common thing, but as the work of him who gave us his image
   at first: Col. iii. 10, The new man is renewed after the image of him
   that created him.' To turn a heart of stone into a heart of flesh, God
   challengeth it to himself, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. This creation showeth two
   things:--

   1. The greatness of the disease; that is clearly seen in the difficulty
   of the remedy. Nothing doth make a man so sensible of the corruptness
   of his nature, as when we hear by what terms our recovery or
   restitution by grace is set forth. It is a second creation, a new
   birth, a resurrection, a raising up of stones to be children to
   Abraham; yea, in a sort, beasts are turned into angels. From these
   things we may a little conceive of the greatness of that disease which
   all mankind were sick of. Every faculty of our souls was both weakened
   and corrupted, and God only by his divine power can restore us; for to
   be cured we must be wholly new made, and who can make or create but
   God? Surely we contributed nothing to it. What enemies were we to our
   own mercies! It is no small matter for darkness to become light in the
   Lord; for a rugged, stubborn creature to be mollified, and submissive
   to the Spirit's discipline; for a slave of the devil to become the
   subject of Christ; that a heap of rubbish should be erected into a
   temple of God, and a dunghill turned into a bed of spices.

   2. It teaches us to magnify this renewing work. If you think the cure
   is no great matter, it will necessarily follow that it deserveth no
   great praise, and so God will be robbed of the honour of our recovery.
   But why then is this work so magnified in the scriptures, and such high
   expressions used about it .? Why is it called an opening of our blind
   eyes; a turning us from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
   to God;' a quickening them that were dead,' and making us new
   creatures'? Why must the Holy Ghost be shed so abundantly upon us for
   our renovation? Surely it is some great thing which all these
   expressions do intend, and should be more magnified in our thoughts,
   that we may give God his due praise and honour. And they sin greatly
   that have contemptuous thoughts or a low esteem of it, or see not the
   absolute necessity of it; and by extenuating this great change, gave
   shrewd suspicion they were never acquainted with it. Surely all that
   have felt what God hath done for their souls, they know how little they
   have contributed to it, they dare not make light of it, and ascribe it
   to their own wit or will, or entertain undervaluing thoughts of this
   grace. Alas I there is an enmity in every carnal heart against
   holiness, till God remove it and subdue it, Rom. viii. 7; Col. i. 21.
   And what shall conquer this enmity but his invincible power? Surely
   this is the gracious and powerful work of the ever-blessed God, and to
   be ascribed to him alone. Can a stony heart of itself become tender? or
   a dead heart quicken itself? or a creature wholly led by sense, and
   addicted to the pleasures of sin, be brought of itself to seek its
   happiness in an unseen world, and of its own accord deny present
   things, and lay up all its hopes in heaven? No; it is God must take
   away the heart of stone, quicken those that are dead in trespasses and
   sins.

   Thirdly, How far the mediation of Christ is concerned in this effect We
   are renewed by God's creating power, but through the intervening
   mediation of Christ.

   1. This creating power is set forth with respect to his merit. The life
   of grace is purchased by his death: 1 John iv. 9, God sent his
   only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live by him;' here
   spiritually, hereafter eternally; life opposite to the death incurred
   by sin. And how by him? By his being a propitiation; that he speaks of
   there, ver. 10. We were in a state of death when the doors of mercy
   were first opened to us, under the guilt and power of sin; for while
   the guilt and tyranny of sin remaineth, we are said to be dead, and
   strangers to the life of God; and we begin to live when first
   regenerated by the Spirit of Christ. Now this we have not without
   Christ being a propitiation for our sins, that is, without doing some
   thing whereby God, without any impeachment of his honour, might show
   himself placable and propitious to mankind; his justice, holiness, and
   hatred of sin being sufficiently demonstrated in the sufferings of
   Christ. Now the honour of his governing justice being kept up, his
   pardoning mercy is the more freely exercised. God may be propitious to
   mankind, and yet still be acknowledged as a sin-hating God.

   2. In regard of efficacy. Christ is a quickening head, or a life-making
   Spirit, 1 Cor. xv. 45. Whatever grace we have comes from God, through
   Christ as Mediator; and from him we have it by virtue of our union with
   him: 2 Cor. v. 17, If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.' As
   soon as joined to him as our head, his grace is applied to us by his
   Spirit. It is first applied by converting grace, and then continually
   supplied by the confirming grace of the Spirit; and so we are fitted to
   every good work. Christ first applieth it in conversion, when he giveth
   us repentance and a new nature, Acts v. 31; and supplieth it by
   continual influence, John xv. 5. We live on him as the branch doth on
   the root. Now from hence we learn what a great benefit renewing grace
   is; it is a fruit of reconciling grace: 2 Cor. v. 18, All things are of
   God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ,' God giveth grace
   only as the God of peace, that is, as pacified by Christ's death. The
   Holy Spirit is the gift of his love, and the fruit of this peace and
   reconciliation which Christ made for us. First, our Lord Jesus Christ
   merited this grace by the value of this sacrifice and bloody
   sufferings, and then doth apply it by the almighty power of his Spirit;
   and Christ is first our ransom, and then the fountain of life unto our
   souls; and so the honour of our whole and entire recovery is to be
   ascribed to our Redeemer. When he satisfied God's justice for our sins,
   he purchased a power to change the heart of man; and he purchased this
   power into his own hands, not into another's, and therefore doth
   accomplish it by his Spirit, 2 Cor. iii. 18. We should often think what
   a foundation God hath laid for the dispensation of his grace, and how
   he would demonstrate his infinite love in giving his Son to be a
   propitiation. for us. When he would show forth his infinite power in
   determining and changing the heart of man, all the persons concurred:
   the Father purposing, the Son by way of redemption and purchase, the
   Holy Ghost by effective power; and all to bring back our souls to God,
   and to make us capable of serving and pleasing him. It is surely a
   workmanship of much cost.

   Two reasons why they are as it were created anew:--

   1. Because of the badness of our former estate. Ruinous and decayed
   buildings are only to be thrown down, to make way for a new structure
   and house to stand in the same place. Man naturally is a creature in a
   state of apostasy and defection, under a loss of original
   righteousness, averse from God, yea, an enemy to him, prone to all
   evil, weak, yea, dead to all spiritual good. And what must be done with
   such a creature to bring him out of his misery, but wholly to new mould
   him and make him, that he may have a new being and life? The scripture
   represents man as blind in his mind, 2 Peter i. 9; perverse in his
   will, Zech. vii. 12; rebellious in his affections, Eph. ii. 3,
   fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.' What sound part
   is there left in us to mend the rest? If we will be brought home to
   God, we must of sinful and polluted become clean and holy; and Who can
   bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,' Job xiv. 4. We must of
   carnal become spiritual, and therefore we must be new born, new made,
   John iii. 6. That instead of minding the things of the flesh we may
   mind the things of the Spirit, we must of worldly become heavenly. Now,
   he that formeth us for this very thing is God,' 2 Cor. v. 5. Ho
   katergazo'menos, he that frameth and createth us for this heavenly
   state, is God. He that is the framer and maker of all things, of
   infinite wisdom, power, and love, he createth us anew in Christ, that
   we may look after eternal life. The heavenly disposition wrought in us
   is a pledge of it.

   2. From the nature of God's work, which is not merely by helping the
   will, but by giving us the will itself, or the act of volition of it;
   not by curing the weakness of it, but by sanctifying it, and taking
   away the sinfulness of it, and inclining it to himself. If the will
   were only in a swoon and languishment, a little moral persuasion and
   excitation, outward or inward, by the word and Spirit, would serve the
   turn; but. we cannot say of it, as Christ of the damsel, She is not
   dead, but sleepeth.' No; the scripture saith, We are dead in trespasses
   and sins,' Eph. ii. 1. God's grace is not only necessary for
   facilitation, that we may more easily pursue and choose that which is
   good; as a horse is necessary that a man may pass on his journey more
   easily, which otherwise he might perform on foot with difficulties. No;
   it is impossible as well as difficult to escape; the carnal life
   without God, Mat. xix. 26. He doth work such a change on a carnal man's
   heart that he contemns the world and seeks after heavenly things. Nay,
   he doth not only give us a remote power to will if we please, or a
   remote power to do if we please, but he giveth to will and to do,'
   Phil. ii. 13; the will itself and the deed itself. Thus is God's
   operation set forth; he reneweth the faculties and exciteth the act of
   willing and doing by his powerful and victorious influence, Ezek.
   xxxvi. 26, 27. Otherwise, if grace did only give us an indifferency, so
   that a man may or may not, then man would be the principal cause of his
   own conversion, and God lose the glory of his grace, and the honour of
   it be ascribed to the liberty of man's own will. God doth not give a
   power to repent and believe, and leave it to the determination of man's
   will to make it effectual; but he giveth faith itself, and repentance
   itself. Faith is his gift: Eph. ii. 8, To you it is given to believe;'
   Phil. i. 29. The Redeemer was raised to give repentance.' Acts v. 31.
   This is the grace which the saints pray for, faith itself, repentance
   itself: Ps. li. 10, Create in me a clean heart;' Heb. xiii. 21, The
   Lord make you perfect to do his will, working in you that which is
   pleasing in his sight.' We pray not only for a grace that gives the
   possibility, but the effect; not only for such as doth invite and
   solicit us to good, but such as doth incline and determine us to good.
   And this is the grace we give thanks for; not a power to repent and
   believe if we please, but for repentance and faith wrought in us. If
   God did only give a power to will if we please, to do if we please, man
   would difference himself, 1 Cor. iv. 7.

   3. With respect to Christ: We are his workmanship, created in Christ
   Jesus,' who is the head of the new world, or renewed estate. All things
   are new in the kingdom of Christ; there is a change of everything from
   what it was before. There is a new Adam, which is Jesus Christ; a new
   covenant, which is the gospel; a new paradise, not that where Adam
   enjoyed God among the beasts, but where the blessed enjoy God among the
   angels; a new ministry, not the posterity of Aaron or tribe of Levi,
   but a ministry of reconciliation, put into their hands whom God hath
   qualified and fitted to be dispensers of these holy mysteries; new
   ordinances, We serve God not in the oldness of the letter, but the
   newness of the spirit;' therefore, if we be in Christ, we must be new
   creatures. We are both obliged and fitted by this new estate to be so.
   Some are in Christ externally by baptism and profession; they are
   visibly in covenant with him, and de jure, of right, are bound to be
   new creatures. Others are in Christ by real internal union. These not
   only ought to be, but de facto are, new creatures; they are made
   partakers of his Spirit, Rom. viii. 9, and by that Spirit they are
   renewed and sanctified. Well, then, since there is a new Lord and a new
   law, all is new; there must be a new creation; for as the general state
   of the church is renewed by Christ, so is every particular believer.

   4. With respect to the use for which this new creation serveth. One is
   mentioned in the text: Created unto good works;' but other things must
   be taken in.

   [1.] In order to our present communion with God. Till we are created
   anew, we are not fit to converse with a holy and invisible God
   earnestly, frequently, reverently, and delightfully, which is our daily
   work and business. The effects of the new creature are life and
   likeness; those that do not live the life of God are estranged from
   him, Eph. iv. 18. Trees cannot converse with beasts, because they do
   not live their life; nor beasts with men, for they have sense only, but
   no reason; nor men with God, till they have somewhat of the same nature
   and life. If one had power to put the spirit of man into a brute beast,
   that beast would discourse reasonably. God hath power to put a divine
   Spirit into his people, to sanctify their souls, that fits them for
   converse with God. Look, as in innocency Adam was alone, though
   compassed about with a multitude of creatures, beasts, birds, and
   plants, yet there was none, till Eve was made, fit to converse with
   him, because they did not live his life; therefore the Lord God said,
   Gen. ii. 18, It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him
   an help meet for him.' The man was alone, because he had none like
   himself that he might converse withal as a man in the exercise of
   speech and reason; the beasts of the field and fowls of the air were no
   fit companions for him; they wanted the means of converse, reason and
   speech: so without grace we are not meet for communion with God, till
   we have faith and love to admire, reverence, and delight in him. So for
   likeness. Conformity is the ground of communion: Amos iii. 3, How can
   two walk together except they be agreed?' Our state of sin is a state
   of enmity, and our state of holiness a state of love. Our old course
   made the breach between us and God, Isa. lix. 2; but the new life and
   likeness qualifies us for communion with him: 1 John i. 6, 7, An holy
   creature may sweetly come and converse with the holy God.'

   [2.] In order to our service and obedience to God. Man is unfit for
   God's use till he be new moulded and framed again: In the text, we must
   be created in Christ Jesus to good works.' Every creature hath
   faculties suitable to the operations that belong to that creature; so
   man must be new created, new formed, that he may be prepared and made
   ready for the Lord. You cannot expect new operations till there be a
   new nature and life. When a man is turned from sin, he is made meet for
   the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work,' 2 Tim. ii. 21.
   Our first care must be to get the heart renewed. Many are troubled
   about this or that duty, or particular branches of the spiritual life;
   first get life itself. There must be principles before there can be
   operations. In vain do we expect strengthening grace before we have
   received renewing grace. This is like little children, who attempt to
   run before they can go or stand. Many complain of this or that
   corruption, but they do not groan under the burden of a corrupt nature;
   as suppose wandering thoughts in prayer, when at the same time the
   heart is habitually averse and estranged from God: as if a man should
   complain of an aching tooth when a mortal disease hath seized upon his
   vitals, or of a cut finger when at the same time he is wounded at the
   heart,--of deadness in duty and want of quickening grace when they want
   converting grace. This is like blowing to a dead coal, to complain of
   infirmities and incident weakness when our habitual aversion from and
   enmity to God is not yet cured, and of unfitness for service, when we
   are not come out of the carnal state.

   [3.] In order to our future enjoyment of God, and that glory and
   blessedness which we expect in his heavenly kingdom; none but new
   creatures can enter into the new Jerusalem. It is said, John iii. 3,
   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' Seeing
   is put for enjoying; yet the expression is emphatical, as if he should
   not be suffered so much as to peep or look within the veil; therefore
   the mere carnal man neither knoweth his true happiness, nor careth for
   it, but followeth after his own lusts, till he be new moulded and
   framed. By nature men are opposite to the kingdom of God, it being
   invisible, future, spiritual, mostly for the soul; and by nature men
   are for things seen, present, and bodily. The interest of the flesh
   governeth all their choices and inclinations; and how unmeet are these
   for heaven! In short, our frail bodies must be changed before they can
   be brought to heaven: We shall not all die, but we shall all be
   changed,' saith the apostle. If the body must be changed, how much more
   the soul? if that which is frail, much more that which is filthy; if
   flesh and blood cannot enter into heaven till it be freed from its
   corruptible qualities, certainly a guilty, corrupted soul cannot enter
   into heaven till it be freed from its sinful qualities.

APPLICATION.

   Use 1. Of information.

   1. That there is such a thing as the new nature, regeneration, or the
   new birth, and the new creature. It is one thing to make us men,
   another to make us saints or Christians. We have understanding, and
   will, and affections, and sense as men, but we have these sanctified as
   Christians. The carnal world thinks Christianity puts strange names
   upon ordinary things; but is it an ordinary thing to row against the
   stream of flesh and blood, and to raise men above those inclinations
   and affections by which the generality of the world are mastered and
   captivated? For a man to be another kind of creature than the rest of
   men are, surely proceeds from a new nature put into him, 1 Peter iv. 4.
   The world wondereth at believers in their contemning the pleasant,
   powerful attractives of sensible things.

   2. That by this new nature a man is distinguished from himself as
   carnal; he hath somewhat which he had not before, something that may be
   called a new life and nature; a new heart that is created, Ps. li. 10;
   and may be increased, 2 Peter iii. 18. In the first conversion we are
   mere objects of grace, but afterwards instruments of grace. First God
   worketh upon us, then by us. On the unregenerate the Spirit worketh
   while they do nothing that is good, sometimes the contrary; the
   regenerate he helpeth whilst they are working, striving, labouring; he
   quickeneth and exciteth their inclination to God. They have some
   principles of operation, there is life in them; and where there is life
   there is some power to act, or else God's most precious gifts would be
   in vain; therefore it is their duty to bestir themselves, 2 Peter i.
   3-5. We have understanding and memory sanctified and planted with a
   stock of divine knowledge, and can retain things on the conscience,
   which if we do not, we are highly culpable before God: Mat. xxv. 25,
   26, Thou wicked and slothful servant,' &c. We have an inclination to
   God and heavenly things, and we must blow it up: Isa. lxiv. 7, 4 There
   is none that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee;' 2 Tim. i. 6,
   Stir up the gift of God that is in thee.'

   3. How little they can make out their recovery to God, and interest in
   Christ, who are not sensible of any change wrought in them. They have
   their old thoughts, their old discourses, their old passions, and their
   old affections, and their old conversations still; the old darkness and
   blindness which was upon their minds, the old stupidity, dullness,
   deadness, carelessness that was upon their hearts, knowing little or
   nothing, or regarding nothing of God; the old end and scope governeth
   them, to which they formerly referred all things. If there were a
   change, there would be some hope the Redeemer had been at work in their
   hearts. You can remember how little savour you had once of the things
   of the Spirit, how little mind to Christ or holiness, how wholly you
   were given up to the pleasures of the flesh, or the profits of the
   world; what a mastery your lusts had then over you, and a hard
   servitude you were in. Is the case altered with you now? Is your taste
   of fleshly delights deadened, your souls taken up more with the affairs
   of another world? Is the drift, aim, and bent of your lives now for God
   and your salvation, and the great business you attend upon the pleasing
   of God and the saving of your souls? Are ye not servants to your senses
   and fleshly appetites, and things here below, but can ye govern
   yourselves, and master these desires? This is a change in deed, but in
   many that profess Christ, and pretend to an interest in him, there is
   no such change to be sensibly seen; their old sins, and their old
   lusts, and the old things of ungodliness are not yet cast off. Surely
   so much old rubbish and rotten building should not be left standing
   with the new. Old leaves in autumn fall off in the spring, if they
   continue so long; so old things should pass away, and all become new.

   4. It informeth us in what manner we should check sin, by remembering
   it is an old thing to be done away, and ill becoming our new estate by
   Christ: 2 Peter i. 9, But he that lacketh these things is blind, and
   cannot see far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old
   sins,' Former sins ought to be esteemed as old rags that are cast off,
   and as vomit never to be licked up again. If we are, and do esteem
   ourselves to be pardoned, we should never build again what we have
   destroyed, nor tear open old wounds--so 1 Peter i. 14, Not fashioning
   yourselves to the former lusts of your ignorance'--nor cast ourselves
   into the old mould and shape, and return to our old bondage and
   slavery. So 1 Cor. v. 7, Purge out the old leaven, that you may be
   wholly a new lump;' so ver. 8, Therefore keep the feast not with old
   leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,' The unsuitableness of sin to
   our present state should stir up our indignation: Hosea xiv. 8, What
   have I to do any more with idols?' Worldly things are pleasing to the
   old man, therefore we should not over-much esteem them; they are not
   new creatures that have not put off the lusts of the old man.

   Use 2. To put us upon self-reflection; are we the workmanship of God,
   created in Christ Jesus? that is, are we made new creatures? It will be
   known by these things,--a new mind, a new heart, and a new life.

   1. Have we a new mind? A new creature hath a new sight of things,
   looketh upon all things with a new eye. He seeth more odiousness in
   sin, more excellency in Christ, more beauty in holiness, more vanity in
   the world, than ever he saw before. Before they did phronein kata`
   sa'rka they knew all things after the flesh, A new value and esteem of
   things doth much discover the temper of the heart: Heb. xi. 26, Moses
   esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
   Egypt.' They esteem the decay of the outward man to be abundantly
   recompensed with the increase of the inward, 2 Cor. iv. 16. A new
   creature is not only changed himself, but all things seem to be changed
   with him. Heaven is another thing, and earth is another thing than it
   was before, so is sin and righteousness; yea, he looketh on his body
   and soul with another eye.

   2. As he hath a new mind and judgment, so the heart is new moulded. The
   great blessing of the new covenant is a new heart. Now the heart is new
   when we are inclined to the ways of God, and enabled to walk in them.

   [1.] There is a new inclination, poise, and weight upon the soul,
   bending it to holy and heavenly things. The inclination to holiness
   David prayeth for: Ps. cxix. 36, Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
   and not to covetousness.' To heavenly things: Paul asserteth, 2 Cor.
   iv. 18, We look not to the things which are seen, but to the things
   which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
   things which are not seen are eternal;' when we always live in
   delightful foresight and expectation of blessedness to come.

   [2.] The heart is enabled also: Ezek. xxxvi. 27, I will put a new
   spirit into you, and cause you to walk in my ways.' Where there is a
   new heart, there is new strength or grace given to serve God
   acceptably, and with reverence and godly fear,' Heb. xii. 28. Indeed
   God assists this power, or else we fail and wax faint; but a power
   there is in some measure to will and do; for the kingdom of God stands
   not in word, but in power.' There is a power to overcome fleshly lusts;
   the heavenly mind is not given us in vain: 1 Peter ii. 11, Dearly
   beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly
   lusts, which war against the soul.' A power to overcome worldly lusts,
   Phil. iv. 13. When we seek no great things for ourselves here in this
   world, we can the better bear all conditions. I do confess (as I said
   before), God must assist this power both in willing and doing,
   purposing and performing. We may have assistance in one kind and not in
   another, Paul saith, to` thelein, &c., Rom. vii. 18, To will is present
   with me, but how to perform that which I would, I have no power.' To
   will is more than to think, to exert our will into action is more than
   both. In all we need God's help. Some may have the power to will, when
   no power to do; so Peter se posse putabat quod se velle sentiebat. But
   yet I describe a Christian, or a new creature, by his power; because
   God's children are never so deserted but that there is some help from
   God. There are auxilia necessaria, helps of grace simply and absolutely
   necessary, which are not denied, when liberal and plentiful aids of
   grace are suspended; and therefore a Christian is to be described by
   his power, though still in a dependence upon God.

   3. A new life, or a new conversation, called walking in newness of
   life,' Rom. vi. 4. Surely he that hath a new principle, the Spirit, and
   not the flesh; a new rule, the law of God, and not the course of this
   world; a new scope, the pleasing, glorifying, and enjoying of God, and
   not the pleasing of men and his own fleshly mind, must needs walk in a
   different course both from other carnal men, and from what he himself
   carried on before. But all these are true of the new creature; he is
   influenced by another principle, Rom. viii. 12, Gal. v. 16; looketh
   upon himself as having another rule, Gal. vi. 16, Ps. i. 2; and
   propoundeth to himself another design and scope, Phil. iii. 20, 2 Cor.
   v. 9; and therefore must needs live another life. Well, then, by these
   things you may judge of your estate.

   Use 3. To exhort you to look after this, that you be the workman ship
   of God, created in Christ Jesus. You will say, What can we do? This is
   God's work, in which we are merely passive.

   I answer--It is certainly an abuse of this doctrine if it lull us
   asleep in the lap of idleness; and we think that because God doth all
   in framing us for the new life, we must do nothing. The Spirit of God
   reasoneth otherwise: Phil. ii. 12, 13, Work out your salvation with
   fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you, both to will
   and to do of his own good pleasure.' This principle can neither be a
   ground of looseness nor laziness. You are under an obligation both to
   return to God, and to use the means whereby you may return. Your
   impotency doth not dissolve your obligation. A drunken servant is a
   servant, and bound to do his work; his master loseth not his right by
   his default. An insolvent debtor is a debtor, and if he cannot pay all,
   he is bound to pay as much as he can. Besides, you are creatures in
   misery; if you be sensible of it, your interest will teach you to do
   what you can to come out of it; and God's doing all is an engagement to
   wait upon him in the use of means, that we may meet with God in his
   way, and he may meet with us in our way. I say, in his way; for God
   hath appointed certain duties to convey and apply this grace. Now we
   are to lie at the pool till the waters be stirred, to continue our
   attendance till God giveth grace, Mark iv. 24. And I say, that God may
   meet with us in our way; for God influenceth all things according to
   their natural inclination. God, that enlighteneth the world by and with
   the sun, burneth with fire, reasoneth with man, acteth necessarily with
   necessary causes, and freely with free causes,--he doth not oppress the
   liberty of the new creature, but preserveth the nature and interest of
   his own workmanship; draweth men with the cords of a man,' Hosea xi. 4.
   He propoundeth reasons and motives, which we must consider, and so
   betake ourselves to a godly course. The object of regeneration is a
   reasonable creature, upon whom God worketh, not as on a stock or stone,
   but maketh use of the faculties which we have, showing us our lost
   estate, and the possibility of salvation by Christ, sweetly inviting us
   to accept of this grace, that he may pardon our sins, sanctify and heal
   our natures, and lead us in a way of holiness unto eternal life. Now
   these means we are to attend upon; and it is some advantage when you
   own your duty, and are sensible of a necessity of changing your estate,
   who would otherwise be altogether careless and mindless of such a
   thing. But when you look on it as a duty, that must be speedily and
   earnestly gone about if you mean to be saved, you are in a fair way of
   cure. By exhortation we demand God's right, and make the creature
   sensible of his own obligation, that he may go about this work as well
   as he can, at least that he may acknowledge the debt, confess his
   impotency, and beg grace. Besides, there are some things to be done
   before this renovation in order thereunto, as wood is dried before it
   is kindled. There are some preparations before conversion, and we are
   to be active about them. As, for instance, that we should rouse up
   ourselves, and consider our case: Ps. xxii. 27, All the ends of the
   earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord;' Ps. cxix. 59, I thought
   on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.' Man is very
   inconsiderate; his soul is asleep till consideration awaken it again.
   We are to search and try our estate whether it be good or bad, Lam.
   iii. 40. Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord.' We
   are to observe God's rebukes: Prov. i. 23, Turn ye at my reproof;' to
   set ourselves to seek after God in the best fashion we can: Hosea v. 4,
   They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God,' that is,
   think of recovering themselves and bending their course to him. Chiefly
   we are to take heed that we do not hinder God's work, and obstruct our
   own mercies: Prov. i. 25, They set at nought my counsel, and would none
   of my reproof.' Sometimes conscience is startled, either as being
   excited by the word, Acts xxiv. 25, or some notable affliction and
   strait, Gen. xlii. 21; by one means or another the waters are stirred,
   great helps are vouchsafed to us; observe these seasons. However, check
   despair. He that did turn water into wine, can turn sinners into
   saints, lions into lambs; he hath not excluded you from his grace,
   therefore do not exclude yourselves. When did he ever forsake the
   anxious and waiting souls that would not give over seeking till they
   did obtain the sanctifying Spirit?

SERMON XX.

   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.--Eph. II.
   10.

   WE come now to the end why we are brought into this estate, created
   unto good works, &c. The end is not to live idly or walk loosely, but
   holily, according to the will of God.

   In this latter clause, Created unto good works, which God hath before
   ordained that we should walk in them,' observe:--

   1. The object: good works; that is, works becoming the new creature: in
   short, we should live Christianly.

   2. God's act about it: hois proetoimasen ho Theos, which God hath
   before ordained. The word signifies both prepared and ordained. (1.)
   God hath prepared these works for us. (2.) God hath prepared us for
   them. He hath prepared them for us either by his decree or precept. If
   you understand it in the first sense, God, that hath ordained the end,
   hath also appointed means, as Acts xxvii. 31 , compared with 24; or
   else appointed by his precept and express will, Micah vi. 8; and he
   hath prepared us for them by his Spirit, making our hearts fit for our
   work, Heb. viii. 10, enlightening the mind, inclining the will. The
   first showeth the necessity of them, the second the easiness of them.
   God hath accommodated all things to that end, enabling us to know our
   duty and to do it.

   3. Our duty: that we should walk in them. Walking noteth both a way and
   an action.

   [1.] It implieth a way, that good works are the way to obtain
   salvation, purchased and granted to us by Jesus Christ. Unless we walk
   in the path of good works we cannot come to eternal life.

   [2.] An action. Walking notes:--

   (1.1 Spontaneity in the principle: not drawn or driven, but walk, set
   ourselves a-going.

   (2.) Progress in the motion. He that walketh sets himself forward and
   gets ground; he doth not stand still or lie down, but goeth on still.

   Doct. That new creatures are both obliged and fitted, or prepared for
   good works.

   I. What is meant by good works?

   II. What obligation lieth on the new creature to make conscience of
   them?

   III. How they are fitted and prepared by that new nature which is
   bestowed upon them by and through Christ?

   I. What is meant by good works?

   1. The kinds.

   2. The requisites.

   First, The kinds--all acts of obedience: more particularly they are
   divided and distributed into five sorts or ranks.

   1. Opera cultus: acts of God's immediate worship, both internal and
   external. The internal acts are faith and love, trust, delight,
   reverence. The children of God are often described by these--by
   believing in his name, John i. 12; love to God and delight in him; Ps.
   xcvii. 10, Ye that love the Lord, hate evil;' Ps. xxxvii. 4, Delight
   thyself also in the Lord;' trust: Ps. lxii. 8, Trust in him at all
   times, ye people;' fear or reverence: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is forgiveness
   with thee, that thou mayst be feared.' External, as to pray, read,
   hear, to be much in communion with God in all the parts of his worship.
   Without works of piety we are practical atheists, Ps. xxxvi. 1, and Ps.
   xiv. 1, 2, 4. God's people do certainly make conscience of these: the
   internal acts are the life of their souls; the external are their
   solace, strength, and support, their songs in the house of their
   pilgrimage, their refreshing by the way. Cornelius, Acts x. 2,. feared
   and prayed to God alway; Daniel would not omit prayer one day though in
   danger of death, .Dan. vi. 10, 11. There is little zeal in them that
   are not frequent with God, but forget him days without number, Jer. ii.
   32.

   2. Opera vocationis: every man must labour in the work to which he is
   called. God is pleased to appoint and accept the duties of our callings
   as a good work. Are they never so mean, yet servants may honour God by
   diligence in their duties: Titus ii. 9, 10, Exhort servants to be
   obedient to their masters, &c., that they may adorn the doctrine of God
   our Saviour in all things.' To be profitable to human society in your
   place is good; the new nature helpeth us so to be: Philem. 11, Onesimus
   in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and
   me.' All have their work, from the Mediator to the poorest creature in
   the world; John xvii. 4, I have glorified thee on earth: I have
   finished the work which thou gavest me to do.' So Titus iii. 14, Let
   ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be
   not unfruitful.' When John's hearers came to know what they should do,
   he referreth every one to their callings, Luke iii. 10-12; walk
   conscionably therein, glorify God, soldiers, publicans, &c. Without
   these good works we are drones in the common hive, yea, burdens upon
   the earth.

   3. Opera justitiae: works of righteousness and justice, to hurt none,
   to give every one his due, to use fidelity in our relations, Acts xxiv.
   16. The credit of religion is much concerned in the just dealing of
   them that profess it. God will have the world to know that religion is
   a good friend to human society: Neh. v. 9, Ought ye not to walk in the
   fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen, our enemies?'
   This was the primitive glory of Christianity, Dent exercitum talem,
   tales exactores fisci, &c. Some carry it so that they deal with God's
   commandments as Hanun with David's messengers, as if they had cut off
   the whole second table, and so prove a stain and blot to religion. In
   short, they that do not make conscience of paying their debts, and
   using justice, equity, and honesty in all their dealings, are robbers,
   thieves, and enemies to human society.

   4. Opera charitatis et misericordiae: as to relieve the poor, to be
   good to all, to help others by our counsel or admonition. We are often
   called upon for these; thus, Acts ix. 36, Dorcas is said to be full of
   good works and alms-deeds which she did.' So 1 Tim. vi. 18, Charge them
   to be rich in good works.' It is not left arbitrary to yon. but laid
   upon you as part of your charge and duty, a debt we owe to God. Now, if
   you do not mind this kind of good works, you are unfaithful stewards in
   the good things committed to your trust. You must not deny God his own
   when he or any of his have need of it.

   5. I think there is another sort of good works which concern ourselves,
   and that is, sobriety, watchfulness, mortification, self-denial. A man
   oweth duty to himself: Titus ii. 12, Teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,' &c. These
   conduce to our safety: 1 Peter v. 8, Be sober, be vigilant; for your
   adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he
   may devour;' and belong to our fidelity to Christ: Gal. v. 24, They
   that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
   lusts thereof.' Therefore take in these also, and call them opera
   militiae Christianae, the works of our spiritual warfare, by which we
   guard ourselves from the enemies of our salvation, that our hands be
   not weakened and enfeebled in God's work, that we may carry it on with
   out unevenness and interruption.

   Secondly, The requisites to a good work are:--

   1. That the person be in a good state: Mat. vii. 17, A good tree
   bringeth forth good fruit,' Married to Christ: Rom. vii. 4, Where fore
   ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye
   should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead,
   that we should bring forth fruit unto God.' A believer: Titus iii. 8,
   Let them which believe in God be careful to maintain good works,' A
   carnal, unregenerate man may do that which is for the matter good; but
   till he be changed in his heart and state, his works are not acceptable
   to God.

   2. The principles of operation must be faith, love, and obedience.
   Faith, owning God's authority: Ps. cxix. 66, Teach me good judgment and
   knowledge, for I have believed thy commandment.' Love, inclining the
   heart: 2 Cor. v. 14, The love of Christ constraineth me.' Obedience,
   swaying the conscience: 1 Thes. iv. 3, This is the will of God, your
   sanctification;' 1 Tim. i. 5, The end of the commandment is charity,
   out of a pure heart and good conscience, and faith unfeigned.' There we
   have the pedigree of good works; faith unfeigned begets a good
   conscience, and that a pure heart, and that love to God, and then all
   particular duties succeed.

   3. A due regard of circumstances, that it may be not only good, but
   done well, Luke viii. 15,--with that diligence, reverence, seriousness,
   alacrity, which the nature of the work doth require.

   4. The end, that it be for God's glory: Phil. i. 11, Filled with the
   fruits of righteousness, which are by Christ Jesus to the praise and
   glory of God.'

   II. How new creatures are obliged to these good works.

   1. With respect to God, he hath ordained that we should walk in them.
   If you refer to his decree, he will have his elect people distinguished
   from others by the good they do in the world, that they may be known to
   be followers of a good God, as the children of the devil are by their
   mischief. His eternal decree is made evident to us by our making
   conscience of good works, and so we make our calling and election
   sure,' 2 Peter i. 10. If you take it for his precept and command,
   surely we should make conscience of what our father giveth us in
   charge. He hath appointed us to do so, sent us into the vineyard to
   work, and shall we say, I will not? Mat. xxi. 29, 30; or loiter and
   neglect when we have given our consent? or pretend to go, and never set
   about it? To a gracious heart the signification of God's will is
   instead of all reasons: 1 Thes. v. 18, In everything give thanks, for
   this is the will of God concerning you;' 1 Peter ii. 15, For this is
   the will of God, that with well-doing you may put to silence the
   ignorance of foolish men.'

   2. With respect to Christ, who died to restore us to a capacity and
   ability to perform these good works: Titus ii. 14, Who gave himself for
   us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works;' not only to do them, but do them with
   alacrity and zeal. As Christ came to raise the comfort of the creature
   to the highest, so also the duty of the creature to the highest, that
   his people might be eminent in holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,
   above all others.

   3. With respect to the Spirit, who reneweth us for this end; we are new
   made, that we may look upon doing good as our calling and only
   business. All other things are valuable according to the use for which
   they serve; the sun was made to give light and heat to inferior
   creatures, and we are enlightened by grace, and inclined by grace, that
   our light may shine before men, Mat. v. 16.

   4. With respect to heaven and eternal happiness, they are the way to
   heaven. We discontinue or break off our walk when we cease to do good;
   but the more we mind good works the more we proceed in our way: Phil.
   iii. 14, Pressing onward' to our final reward, and at length our
   entrance is more full, and with greater peace, 2 Peter i. 11.

   III. How are they fitted and prepared by this new nature that is put
   into them for good works?

   Ans. There is a remote preparation, and a near preparation.

   1. The remote preparation is an inclination and propensity to all the
   acts of the holy and heavenly life. All creatures have an inclination
   to their proper operations, so the new creature. As the sparks fly up
   and the stones downward by an inclination of nature, so are their
   hearts bent to please and serve God. The inclination is natural, the
   acts are voluntary, because it is an inclination of a free agent: The
   law of God is in their hearts,' Ps. xl. 8; Ps. xxxvii. 31. Others force
   themselves, but here there is an affinity between the work and the
   vital principle which is in us, so that we need not much enforcement: 1
   Thes. iv. 9, As touching brotherly love, I need not write unto you, for
   you are taught of God to love one another.' Now, God's teaching is not
   by expression, but by impression; he hath inclined, suited our hearts
   to it: as there need not many arguments to move the mother to give suck
   to her tender infant; nature hath taught her, left such an instinct and
   inclination upon her, which doth sufficiently excite her to do it.

   2. The near preparation is called promptitude and readiness for every
   good work, or a ready obedience to every good work.' Titus iii. 1. So 1
   Tim. vi. 18, Ready to distribute;' Heb. xiii. 16, Ready to
   communicate.' So Paul, heto'imos echo, Acts xxi. 13. This is beyond
   inclination. The fire hath an inclination to ascend upwards, yet
   something may violently keep it down; so a Christian may have a will to
   good, a strong, not a remiss will, but yet there are some impediments,
   Rom. vii. 18. Inclination implieth a remote power, but readiness the
   next and immediate power; therefore a Christian ought to keep himself
   in a readiness or fitness of disposition for his duty, whether it
   concerneth God, ourselves, or others. This is seen in zeal, that
   beareth down all impediments. All graces are operative, and zeal is
   that earnest impulsion and activity of every grace where it is in
   strength and vigour. Faith worketh, Gal. v. 6. Love constraineth, 2
   Cor. v. 14. Hope quickeneth, 1 Peter i. 3, a lively hope.' This
   proceedeth from the new nature when it is in right frame and strength.
   We need not only make conscience of our duty, or have some mind to it,
   but our hearts will not let us have any quiet and rest without it: 2
   Peter i. 8, They make you that you shall be neither barren nor
   unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.' Christians must
   be zealous of good works.' Titus ii. 14. Paul was pressed in spirit.'
   Acts xvii. 16; Acts xviii. 5.

   The benefits that come by it are:--

   1. We do good works more easily, as being inclined thereunto: Exod.
   xxxv. 29, The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
   Lord;' Ps. cx. 3, Thy people shall be willing in the clay of thy
   power.' There is a great deal of difference between doing things by
   compulsion and doing things from an inclination; between Israel's
   making brick in Egypt and building the wall in Nehemiah's time, Neh.
   iv. 6.

   2. With more delight and alacrity: 1 John v. 3, His commandments are
   not grievous;' Ps. cxii. 1, Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord,
   that delighteth greatly in his commandments.' It is a pleasure to them
   to do a good work; to others, a toil.

   3. With constancy. That which is forced lasts not long; upon the first
   occasion we break out, cast off the burden which pincheth and galleth
   us. A man is never constant to his duty till he be held to it by his
   heart; and the bias of the heart is not fear, but love. You cannot
   easily persuade him against his love and inclination, though you may
   overcome his fears: Cant. viii. 6, 7, Set me as a seal upon thine arm:
   for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave. Many
   waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man
   would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be
   contemned.'

   The uses are:--

   1. For reproof of many professing Christians, who are not more prepared
   for the Lord, and made ready for every good .work. Alas! some are to
   every good work reprobate,' Titus i. 16, unfit for any Christian
   practice. In others, all their holiness standeth in being less vicious
   or wicked than others. If. they avoid the greater crimes, though they
   freely practise the less, they are accounted good men. Some talk, but
   do nothing, like cypress trees, tall and beautiful, but unfruitful; or
   the carbuncle, afar off seeming all on fire, but the touch discovers it
   to be key-cold: their zeal is more in their tongues than their actions.
   Others are very unready, arguing for a mediocrity, disputing every inch
   with God, beating down the price of religion as low as they can, as
   little worship and charity as may be, and will do no more than needeth,
   and it is well if they do that. True goodness, like live honey,
   droppeth of its own accord, 2 Cor. viii. 2; and is always desirous to
   do more for God: Ps. lxxi. 14, I will praise thee more and more;' Phil.
   i. 9, I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge
   and in all judgment;' 1 Thes. iv. 1, Furthermore, we exhort you,
   brethren, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to
   please God, so ye would abound more and more.' But little of this
   temper is to be found.

   The second use, of information.

   First, Observe the deduction of good works from their proper causes,
   viz., the will of God requiring, our regeneration fitting: the one
   determineth our duty, the other maketh us ready to perform it. While
   carnal, that which we do is but the image of a good work, not really
   and spiritually good.

   Secondly, The necessity of good works.

   1. Necessitate consequentis, as the fruit and end of regeneration. All
   things are valued by their use. What doth the new creature serve for
   but that we may walk in newness of life? otherwise it is but a notion.
   It is not given us to lie hid in the heart, as a sluggish, idle
   quality, but that we may act by it, and improve it for God. The Lord
   made no creature in vain. Indeed, all that we have from God, both in
   nature and grace, was that we might be fruitful in holiness. In nature
   we have life, health, and parts for nothing else, but that by our
   present duty we may prepare ourselves for everlasting joys. All God's
   mercies bind us to diligence, all his ordinances are means to help us,
   all his graces are power to enable us; and there is, over and above,
   the Holy Spirit to excite and quicken that power, John iv. 10; Ezek.
   xxxvi. 27.

   2. Necessitate praecepti. God hath required them at our hands. Now we
   must make conscience of what God hath required, especially when all his
   commandments are holy, just, and good' If some greater thing were
   required, ought we not to have done it? 2 Kings v. 13. But when he hath
   required such noble work, shall we refuse? There is nothing in his law
   but what becometh his nature, preserveth and makes happy ours.

   3. Necessitate medii, as the way to heaven. Good works are
   indispensably required of grown persons if they mean to be saved: Heb.
   xii. 14, Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
   shall see God.' A Christian shall be judged at the last day by what he
   hath done: Rev. xx. 12, I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
   God; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which was
   the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things that
   were written in the books, according to their works;' 1 Peter i. 17, If
   ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth every man
   according to his work,' Profession will not carry it, but our works
   come into the judgment. So Rev. xiv. 13, Their works follow them;' that
   is, they have the fruit and comfort of them in another world, and
   without them we cannot be saved.

   4. Necessitate signi, as evidences of our right to salvation, both to
   others and ourselves. Works or external acts are more sensible and
   visible, and also liable to the notice of our own consciences; and it
   is more hard to judge of the internal grace than the external fruits.

   [1.] As to others. God seeth what is in our hearts, but men see it not
   until the effects manifest it. When John suspected the pharisees, he
   said to them, Mat. iii. 8, Bring ye forth therefore fruits meet for
   repentance.' The fear of God is more known by the external act than by
   the internal habit; therefore that description is given, Prov. viii.
   13, The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the
   evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate;' and Job xxviii. 28, The
   fear, of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is
   understanding.' The current of a man's life and actions doth best
   expound and interpret his heart. Thus the psalmist discovered the
   wicked: Ps. xxxvi. 1, The transgression of the wicked saith within my
   heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.'

   [2.] To ourselves, holy conversation and godliness is the surest note
   of our regeneration. We judge others by external works alone, For the
   tree is known by its fruit,' Mat. vii. 16. Charity forbids us to pry
   any further; but we judge ourselves by internal and external works
   together. If within we have faith in Christ, a love to God, and hatred
   of evil, a delight in holiness, a deep sense of the world to come, all
   which graces make up the new nature, then these things issue out into a
   holy conversation. This breedeth joy and, peace of conscience: 2 Cor.
   i. 12, This is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in
   simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
   grace of God, we have had our conversation in the would;' 1 John iii.
   18, 19, Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in
   truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
   our hearts before him.'

   [3.] That good works must not be opposed to God's mercy and free grace,
   or Christ's satisfaction, merit, and righteousness, either in the
   matter of justification or salvation, but kept in a due subordination
   to God's grace and Christ's merits. This is the business of this
   context, to reconcile the grace of God with the necessity of good
   works, et e contra; and very well it may be, for they are part of the
   grace obtained. He is most beholden to God, and indebted to grace, who
   is enabled to do most good, for all is from him: Phil. ii. 13, He
   worketh in us both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure;' so
   that our very doing is receiving. But because there are a sort of men
   that may be called justiciaries, who trust, and teach others to trust,
   to their own virtues and works, without a Saviour, or ascribe the part
   of a Saviour to them; and on the other side, the libertines, who teach
   men not to look at anything in themselves at all, not as an evidence,
   condition, or means, but to trust to Christ's blood to be instead of
   faith, repentance, and obedience, which is their duty to be performed
   by them, therefore it will be necessary to be well acquainted with what
   is truly the part and office of Christ, what is truly the office of
   faith and repentance, what of works, that you may be sure to give
   everything its due, and may wholly trust Christ for his part, and not
   join faith, or any of your works and duties, in the least degree, of
   that trust and honour which belongeth to our Saviour, but regard them
   according to that use for which they are commanded in the gospel.

   First, Our works, whatever they are, either duties to God or man, are
   not the first moving cause or inducement to incline God to show us
   favour, or to bring about our salvation. No; this honour must be
   reserved for the grace of God, which moveth and stirreth all in the
   business of our salvation. It was his grace to provide us a Saviour:
   John iii. 16, God so loveth the world, that he gave his only-begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have
   everlasting life.' And the giving of faith or converting grace to some
   before others, is the mere effect of his mercy and good pleasure: Eph.
   ii. 4, 5, God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
   hath loved us, when we were dead in trespasses and sins, hath quickened
   us together with Christ: by grace ye are saved.' Then the benefits
   consequent upon conversion are from God's love and mercy. As
   justification: Rom. iii. 24, Justified freely by his grace;' not only
   by his grace, but freely; that is, not excited by our works, but acting
   freely of its own accord. Then for eternal life, we have it from the
   grace of God and the mercy of our Redeemer: Jude 21, Looking for the
   mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.' So that grace is the
   first mover and principle in the whole business of our salvation; it is
   originally from grace, and all along by grace.

   Secondly, Our works before or after conversion are not that
   righteousness, not any part of that meritorious righteousness, by
   virtue of which sins are expiated, the wrath of God appeased, all
   blessings of heaven purchased, and we reconciled to God. For this is
   only to be ascribed to the merit and satisfaction of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. When we were enemies, we were reconciled by his death, and are
   saved by his' life,' Rom. v. 10. He is our propitiation; we live by
   him: 1 John iv. 9, 10, In this was manifested the love of God towards
   us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we
   might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
   he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.' It
   is Christ's office and honour to be a sacrifice for sin and a
   propitiation for us, and a perfect Saviour and intercessor; to obtain
   the Spirit, to fit us for our present duty and future happiness. We are
   his workmanship in Christ.

   Thirdly, Our works or duties which we perform in obedience to God, are
   not the first means to apply the grace of the Redeemer, or the
   condition of our first entrance into the evangelical estate. No; that
   is proper to repentance and faith: Rom. iii. 22, The righteousness of
   God is by faith unto all and upon all them that believe.' And
   repentance is frequently required also to receive pardon and the gift
   of the Holy Ghost: Acts ii. 38, Repent and be baptized every one of you
   in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall
   receive the gift of the Holy Ghost;' Acts iii. 19, Repent ye,
   therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.' It is
   the penitent believing sinner that is qualified for these privileges;
   or he that thankfully and humbly accepts of the offered Saviour, and
   consents to the covenant made with God the Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit; he is washed from his sins in the blood of Christ, reconciled,
   adopted into God's family, and made an heir according to the hope of
   eternal life,' Titus iii. 7. This first faith, by which we believe and
   consent to the covenant, implieth both a dependence on God's mercy and
   Christ's merits, and also a consent of obedience or hearty subjection
   to God.

   Fourthly, When we have consented to accept Christ and his benefits, and
   do give ourselves to him, then works or new obedience follow, as
   necessary to continue our right to pardon and life. For none have
   benefit by God's covenant but those that keep his covenant as well as
   make it; and without this we cannot have communion with God: 1 John i.
   7, If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
   one with another;'--nor evidence the reality of our faith and
   repentance. St Paul was sent to preach to the Gentiles, That they
   should repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance,' Acts
   xxvi. 20. Besides, we cannot preserve our claim and right, if we do not
   still go on to do good: 1 Tim. vi. 18; Ezek. xviii. 24, When the
   righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity,
   shall he live? all his righteousness shall not be mentioned; in his
   trespasses that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned,
   in them shall he die.' It is true of the hypocrite without scruple, and
   of the real righteous man; if you suppose the one you may suppose the
   other. Well, these things must not be confounded or opposed: not
   confounded, but we must distinctly consider what is proper to the grace
   of God, proper to the merit of Christ, proper to faith, proper to
   works; not opposed, so as to make the one exclude the other: as the
   grace of God to exclude the merit of Christ, or serve instead of it;
   nor the merit of Christ, his blood and righteousness, to exclude faith
   and repentance, or be instead of them; nor faith to exclude good works,

   Fifthly, All the applying grace is from first to last wrought in us by
   the Spirit. He doth renew and heal our natures, as coming to us from
   the grace of God and merits of Christ: Titus iii. 5, 6, According to
   his mercy he saveth us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
   the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
   Saviour.' By the Holy Spirit working in us habitual grace and exciting
   it, we believe, repent, obey, do whatever is necessary to be done to
   obtain eternal life; therefore this must not be omitted, but
   acknowledged as a great part of this grace.

   Third use. To exhort us, if we would show ourselves to be new creatures
   indeed, to be full of good works. The arguments to move us are:--

   1. It is a necessary fruit of inward grace, and so doth plainly show
   that you are partakers of heavenly wisdom: James iii. 17, The wisdom
   which is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to
   be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.' The carnal worldling, all
   his wisdom is to grow rich to himself, which indeed is but folly, Luke
   xii. 21. His business is to live to the flesh, Gal. vi. 8. He layeth
   out all his strength, time, and care, and wealth for the feeding his
   own carnal desires; but the other soweth to the Spirit, layeth out
   himself in works of piety and charity.

   2. External acts, which flow from an internal principle, increase the
   habit; the more you do good, the more you are enabled to do good, as
   bodily strength is increased by exercise. Why is the right hand more
   agile, stronger, and bigger than the left? It is oftener exercised, and
   so fuller of blood and spirits. So in grace, the more you act faith,
   the more is faith increased. Love groweth more fervent, being kept in a
   constant exercise, and hope more lively and effective. Always actions
   increase the principles which did produce them: partly of their own
   nature: 1 John ii. 5, Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love
   of God perfected.' The more acts of love he puts forth towards God, the
   more doth his love increase in him: partly by divine reward: Heb. vi.
   10, He is not unrighteous to forget your labour of love, which ye have
   showed towards his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and
   do minister,' God rewards them temporally: 2 Cor. ix. 8, God is able to
   make all grace abound towards you, that you, always having all
   sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work;' that is, to
   give you to be liberal at all times. And when he saith God is able, it
   not only implieth that God is the fountain of all plenty, and sovereign
   disposer of it, and so hath power to make you the richer rather than
   the poorer by your liberality, to make every alms you give like the oil
   in the cruse, to multiply as you pour it out, that there shall be
   enough for every object and every occasion, but also he is sure to make
   it good, for he quotes it again in the next verse, As it is written, He
   hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
   remaineth for ever.' It is taken out of Psalm cxii., where there are
   signal promises of wealth and riches in the house of the liberal
   almsgiver. God rewards them eternally: 2 Cor. ix. 6, He which soweth
   sparingly shall reap sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully shall
   reap bountifully.' Now is the seed-time, hereafter is our harvest and
   crop; we shall have a liberal reward from God in the general
   resurrection. God also rewards his obedient servants spiritually,
   internally; and that not only with more comfort and peace, but by
   increasing the grace itself.; for God, that punishes sin with sin, doth
   reward grace with grace. Wells are sweeter for draining; on the other
   side, a key that is seldom turned rusts in the lock. An intermission of
   good works makes us more unable and unready for them.

   3. It is a greater honour to God: John xv. 8, Herein is my Father
   glorified, that you bear much fruit;' Phil. i. 11, Being filled with
   the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory
   and praise of God;' 2 Thes. i. 11, 12, Wherefore we pray for you, that
   our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good
   pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power, that the
   name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him.'
   Christ's religion is not a barren religion, but full of good works. It
   is a mighty credit to religion in you that profess it, when goodness is
   the constitution of your hearts, to do good the business of your lives.

   4. It edifieth others, and provoketh an holy emulation: Heb. x. 24, Let
   us consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works.' We
   provoke them most by our example when they are cold, negligent, and
   backward to works of piety and mercy. In all things we should be an
   instance of divine virtues.

   5. This is the fruit which God expecteth from us, that the trees of
   righteousness should bear the fruits of righteousness. If we frustrate
   his expectation, he will hew us down and cast us into the fire, Mat.
   iii. 10. Therefore good works are not needless things.

   The means to enable us are:--

   1. Be sure that you are renewed. The dead cannot do the works of the
   living, Neither do men gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles,'
   Mat. vii. 16. Our first business is to look to our conversion to God.
   All outward duties begin in the heart; they are valued no farther than
   they come from it sanctified.

   2. Keep your hearts under a sense of God's authority, that you may feel
   something in your own bosoms that may tell you you are bound to obey
   him, and may plead God's right with you. This is done by a frequent
   meditation upon your creation and redemption: your creation giveth God
   a full right to you, and redemption maketh it comfortable; by both you
   see you are his: Acts xxvii. 23, There stood by me this night the angel
   of God, whose I am, and whom I serve.'

   3. You are intrusted with his talents, and of their improvement you
   must give an account: Mat. xxv. 14, A lord called his servants, and
   delivered to them his goods, in order to improvement.

   4. What encouragement we have from a gracious God and covenant, which
   takes not advantage of involuntary weaknesses, but accepteth their
   endeavours who sincerely do their best: Mal. iii. 17, I will spare him,
   as a man spareth his son that serveth him.'

   5. Remember often your great obligation to God; you can never do so
   much for him as he deserveth of you: Ps. cxvi. 12, What shall I render
   to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?'

   6. Do all as in God's eye, and with a constant dependence upon him: Ps.
   xvi. 8, I have set the Lord always before me.' Make him your paymaster,
   governor, and judge, and it will not only keep you sincere, but
   diligent in good works. The work is not sincerely done when you look to
   man, nor thoroughly done. Such have their reward only here, Mat. vi.

   7. Love your work. A little thing will stop him that doth it
   unwillingly: Ps. cxix. 47, 48, I will delight myself in thy
   commandments, which I have loved;' and I will lift up my hands unto thy
   commandments, which I have loved.'

   8. Account yourselves much beholden to God, that he will employ you in
   any service for his glory.

EDITORIAL NOTE.

   THE ejection of two thousand ministers by the Act of Uniformity in 1662
   could not fail to make a great impression on the minds of the people of
   England, and especially of the ministers who were ejected, and of the
   people who had enjoyed their ministry. The last utterances of these
   ministers in the pulpits which they were about to quit were naturally
   listened to with peculiar interest. Many of these were published from
   notes taken by hearers; and in the following year, 1663, these were
   collected and published in a volume, under the title of "Farewell
   Sermons." In this volume, that by Dr Manton occupies the second place,
   coming immediately after that of Mr Calamy. From this volume it is now
   reprinted.

FAREWELL SERMON.

   Wherefore, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of
   witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
   easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
   before us.--Heb. XII. 1.

   IN the former chapter you have a spiritual chronicle, or a catalogue of
   the Lord's worthies, and all the eminent effects of their faith; and
   now the apostle comes to make use of this history, that he had produced
   through so many successions of ages, of all the holy men of God that
   excelled in faith: Wherefore, seeing we are compassed about with so
   great a cloud of witnesses,' &c.

   The text is wholly hortatory. In it observe:--

   1. The premises or principle the apostle worketh upon: seeing we are
   compassed, &c.

   2. The practical inferences which are deduced from thence, and they are
   two:--

   [1.] One concerning the privative part of our duty: let us lay aside
   every weight, &c. There is something external and without, like to clog
   us in our way to heaven: every weight; and something within that will
   hinder and trouble us within; therefore he saith, and the sin which
   doth so easily beset us.

   [2.] Here is the positive part: let us run with patience the race that
   is set before us. There is motion: run; the manner: with patience; the
   stage or way: the race that is set before us.

   My purpose is to give you some brief thoughts upon this useful and
   practical inference of the apostle from the histories of the faithful
   before recorded. Therefore I will sum up the whole text in this
   point:--

   Doct. The people of God, that have such a multitude of examples of holy
   men and women set before them, should prepare themselves to run the
   spiritual race with more patience and cheerfulness.

   There are two things in this doctrine--the encouragement and the duty.
   I shall open both with respect to the circumstances of the text.

   First, the encouragement: a multitude of examples; or, as in the text,
   seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses.'
   Mark, here are witnesses: a great cloud of witnesses; and these
   compassing us round about.

   First, here are witnesses. By that term we are to understand those
   worthy saints mentioned and reckoned up in the former chapter, Abel,
   Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, &c., all the saints of God that have had
   experience of the goodness of his providence to them, and the
   fulfilling of his promises. They are all called witnesses. Why? Because
   they depose a testimony for God, and speak to future generations to be
   constant, as they were, that they might receive the like reward. This
   witness was partly in their faith, and partly in the fruit of their
   faith.

   1. They witnessed by their faith: John iii. 33, He that hath received
   his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.' A man that hath
   soundly digested the promises, that expresses his faith by cheerfulness
   and patience under all difficulties, troubles, delays, and those sundry
   trials that he meets with, he gives it under hand and seal, proclaims
   it to the world that he hath to do with the true God.

   2. They witnessed in the fruits of their faith, as they give us an
   instance of God's fidelity towards them that faithfully adhere to and
   firmly believe in his promises; so it is said, Heb. vi. 12, Be not
   slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit
   the promise.' Let faith but set patience a-work, do but hold out a
   little while with God, and you may learn by the example of all those
   holy men we shall inherit the promises; they shall be made good to a
   tittle, and not one thing fail of all that the Lord hath spoken; as
   these holy men were exercised and tossed to and fro, but it succeeded
   well with them at the last. Oh! then, let us hearken to the deposition
   of these worthy witnesses that are recorded in the scripture, and with
   such an invincible resolution as theirs was, let us hold on our course
   towards true happiness. If we do not, they that are now propounded as
   witnesses to us, will, at the day of judgment, be produced as witnesses
   against us. And pray, also, let us remember that we are to continue and
   keep afoot that testimony to succeeding generations; for not only the
   prophets and holy men of God were God's witnesses, but all God's people
   also are his witnesses, Isa. xliii. 10; by their faith, patience,
   diligence, constancy, and cheerfulness under afflictions, they are to
   give it under hand and seal to the world that God is a true and
   faithful God. But now, if we, either by our sinful walking or by our
   drooping discouragements, discredit Christ and his profession, then we
   are witnesses against him; we deny that religion which we would seem to
   profess and cry up: Titus i. 16, They profess they know God, but in
   works they deny him;' and the more dangerous because deeds are more
   deliberate than words, and so a greater evidence of what we think in
   our hearts. If we, by drooping discouragements and sinful walking,
   discredit religion, we deny it, and do in effect put the lie upon
   Christ. Therefore let us remember they were witnesses, and so must we.

   Secondly, By a figurative speech they are called a cloud--having a
   cloud of witnesses. Why so? I might trouble you with many conceits
   interpreters have had of this word cloud. Say some, because of the
   raisedness of their spirits, because clouds fly aloft. Clouds, for the
   fruitfulness of their doctrine, as clouds send down fruitful showers
   upon the earth; and clouds, because they cool and cover us from the
   heat; so some would gloss for our comfort. Others, with more judgment,
   say, a cloud with allusion to the pillar of cloud which conducted the
   Israelites to Canaan: yet neither doth this come up fully to the scope
   of the apostle; for the apostle speaks not of a cloud that goes before
   us, but of a cloud that compasses us round about, and therefore a
   cloud. The reason why it is called so, is the number and multitude of
   those witnesses, as a cloud is made up of a multitude of vapours
   gathered together and condensed into one body; and so the expression is
   often used: Ezek. xxxviii. 9, Thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the
   land,' &c., noting the increase of the people when God would restore
   them, the multitude of converts. And so, in profane authors, Livy hath
   such an expression; an army of men is called a cloud. But this is
   enough to show the intent of this expression, that there are a
   multitude, a very great number. Though the godly, comparatively, and
   with respect to the wicked, are a few; yet, considered in themselves,
   they are a great number; for if the martyrs and those glorious
   instances of heroic faith, and that under the Old Testament, when God's
   interest was more confined to one people, if there were such a church
   then of so great a number, what will the whole church of the Old and
   New Testament be, when we shall meet together in heaven? We are often
   discouraged with the paucity of professors, and are apt to think
   ourselves to be left alone, 1 Kings xix. 10. But let us remember there
   is a cloud of witnesses; we are not solitary now, and certainly we
   shall not want company when we come to heaven, To the innumerable
   company of,' &c.

   Again, it meets with an ordinary and strong temptation which Satan
   suggests to the hearts of the godly, that they are singular and
   matchless in their afflictions, that none of the people of God have
   ever undergone such difficulties as they are exposed unto; and this
   makes them question their Father's affection, and put themselves out of
   the number of his children. Ay! but all these things are accomplished
   in the saints of God before you. Here is a cloud of witnesses that have
   been exercised and tried to purpose, 1 Peter v. 9. They are troubled
   with a busy devil, a naughty world, a corrupt heart; all have had their
   trial from God's correcting hand: The same afflictions are accomplished
   in your brethren that are in the world.' So that we have many fellows;
   our lot is no harder than the saints of God that have gone before us,
   for there is a cloud of witnesses.

   Thirdly, Observe the apostle calls it a cloud that compasses us round
   about--i.e., we have instances for every trial, temptation, duty, that
   we are put upon. Here we have examples of those that have fulfilled the
   commands of Christ on this side with an undaunted courage; and the
   examples of those that have borne the cross of Christ with an
   invincible patience. Here we have examples of those that have conquered
   right-hand temptations, that have despised the delights of the world;
   and there are those that have conquered left-hand temptations, that
   have not been broken and affrighted with the terrors of the world. All
   the saints of God have trodden that way, the same paths wherein we are
   to walk after them. We cannot look this way or that way, but we have
   instances of faith, confidence in God, and patience: We are compassed
   about,' &c. In short, here lies the encouragement that Christians
   should propound to themselves.

   1. That there are examples. Christians of later times have more to
   answer for their infidelity than those of former ages. They that first
   believed the promises believed without such a cloud of witnesses, or
   multitude of examples. Many have gone before us that have broken the
   ice, and that found good success from their own experience; they have
   commended God to us as a true and faithful God, and will not you go on?
   When Jonathan and his armour-bearer climbed up the rocks of the
   Philistines, then the people were encouraged to go up after. So here
   are some that have gone before you, and it hath succeeded well with
   them.

   2. These examples are many; not one or two, that might be supposed to
   be singularly assisted, and to have eminent prerogatives above the rest
   of their brethren; but many in every age--a whole cloud of them.

   3. There are examples of many rare and excellent men, the best that
   ever lived under heaven: Take, my brethren, the prophets for an
   example,' &c., James v. 10.

   4. They are propounded to us, not for their words only, and for their
   profession, but for their deeds, for their bitter sufferings; and they
   abundantly manifest to us that there is nothing impossible in our duty,
   or anything so difficult but may be overcome through Christ's strength
   enabling us. They all had the same nature we have; they were of the
   like passion with us, flesh and blood as we are, of the same relations
   and concernments. And then, on the other side, we have the same cause
   with them, the same recompense of reward to encourage us, the same God
   and Saviour to recompense us. He suffered for us as well as for them;
   therefore we should follow in their steps, and hold fast our confidence
   to the end; for they have showed us that poverty, reproaches, death
   itself, and all those things that would look harsh and with a ghastly
   aspect upon the eyes of the world, are no such evils but that a
   believer may rejoice in them, and triumph over them. I say, they have
   showed the blandishments of the world have not such a charm, but they
   may be renounced without any loss of considerable joy and contentment;
   and that the duties of Christianity are not so hard but that a little
   waiting upon God will bring in grace enough to perform them; therefore
   saith the apostle, Seeing we have a cloud of witnesses, let us lay
   aside,' &c. And so I come to the encouragement, to the--

   Second thing, and that is the duty here pressed. (1.) Here is the
   privative. (2.) The positive part of our duty. Here is mortification
   and vivification. Mortification: Let us lay aside,' &c.; vivification:
   Let us run with patience,' &c. In both the branches he alludes to terms
   proper to races. In a race, you know, men strip themselves of their
   clothes and whatever is burdensome and heavy, that they may be the more
   light of foot; and so the apostle bids us lay aside every weight;' and
   they did withal diet themselves, that they might have no clog from
   within: 1 Cor. ix. 25, Every man that striveth for the mastery, is
   temperate in all things;' i.e., they took care that they did not clog
   and dispose [25] themselves for the race they were to run. But they
   verily run only for a corruptible crown; we for a crown that is
   incorruptible and glorious; so, according to this double practice of
   racers, we are to cast aside every weight from without, &c. So here is
   a double object--laying aside every weight, and every sin. There is
   onus externum--the weight without that presses us down and hinders our
   speed; and then there is impedimentum internum, there is sin, that
   which weakens within. By reason of the former we make little speed, by
   reason of the latter we are often interrupted; and therefore we must do
   as they, that they might be swift and expedite: Lay aside every
   weight,' and be more temperate in all things.' Herein a runner in a
   race differs from a traveller: a traveller strengthens himself for his
   journey as well as he can, his clothes on, sometimes carries a great
   burden with him; but a runner of a race makes himself as light as he
   can. But to come more particularly to the words.

   First, Lay aside every weight.' By weight is meant those things that
   burden the soul, and make our heavenly progress more tedious and
   cumbersome; and by weight is meant (I think) the delights and cares of
   the world, the multitude of secular business, all our earthly
   contentments and affairs, so far as they are a burden to us, hinder us
   in our way to heaven; these must all be put off: Luke xxi. 34, saith
   Christ, Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,'
   &c. The heart that is depressed cannot be so free for God and the
   offices of our heavenly calling, when we give way to surfeiting,
   drunkenness, and cares of this world.

   1. The heart may be overcharged with the delights of the world.
   Surfeiting and drunkenness must not be taken in the gross notion; you
   must not think of spewing, reeling, vomiting, as if to avoid these were
   a full compliance with Christ's direction; the heart may be over
   charged when the stomach is not. There is a dry drunkenness and a more
   refined surfeiting; and that is when the heart grows heavy, unfit for
   prayer, relishes not the things of the Spirit; when the delights of the
   flesh clog the wheel, abate that vigour and cheerfulness that we should
   show forth in the worship of God and holy actions. When the delights of
   the flesh withdraw us from that watchfulness and diligence that is
   necessary in taking care for our souls, then the heart is over charged.
   Voluptuous living is a great sin, it chokes the seed of piety so soon
   as planted in the heart, so that they can bring nothing to perfection;
   it brings a brawn and a deadness upon the conscience and affections;
   there is nothing that hardens the heart so much as the softness of
   carnal pleasure: Jude 19, Sensual, having not the Spirit.' Sensuality
   quenches our natural bravery and the briskness of spirit that becomes a
   man; much more doth it hinder the sublime operations of the Spirit of
   God. Well then, remember, Christians, you are not only travellers by
   the way, but runners in a race. If we were to speak to you only under
   the notion of travellers in a way, this were enough to wean you from
   the delights of the flesh: 1 Peter ii. 11, As strangers and pilgrims,
   abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul.' The more you
   indulge these fleshly lusts, the more you hearten and strengthen the
   great enemy of your souls, and starve the better part. But you are as
   runners in a race. By this metaphor the duty is more bound upon you;
   much more should you beat down the body and keep it in subjection. The
   apostle hath a notable word: 1 Cor. ix. 27, I keep under my body, and
   bring it in subjection,' &c. 1 beat down my body; you must either keep
   under pleasures, or pleasures will keep you under; for a man is soon
   brought under the power, dominion, and tyranny of evil customs and some
   brutish pleasure by indulging the lusts of the flesh, 1 Cor. vi. 12. Be
   but a little addicted to any one thing, and you are brought under the
   power of it. The flesh waxes wanton and imperious, and a slavery grows
   upon you by degrees. The more you cocker carnal affections, the more
   they increase upon you; and therefore you must hold the reins hard,
   exercise a powerful restraint. Solomon in his penitentials gives us an
   account of his own folly, and how fearfully he was corrupted this way:
   Eccles. ii. 10, Whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
   withheld not my heart from any joy,' &c. This was that which brought
   him to such a lawless excess, and at length to fall off from God. When
   we give nature the full swing, and use pleasure with too free a
   license, the heart is insensibly corrupted, and the necessities of life
   are turned into disease, and all that you do it is but in compliance
   with your lusts; your eating and drinking is but a meat-offering and
   drink-offering to lusts and carnal appetite. I remember Solomon saith,
   Prov. xxix. 21, He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a
   child, shall have him become his son at length;' i.e., allow a servant
   too much liberty, and he will no more know his condition, but grow
   contemptuous, bold, and troublesome; so it is here. We are all the
   worse for license. Natural desires, unless they feel fetters and
   prudent restraints, grow unruly and excessive; and therefore it is good
   to abate the liberty of the flesh, that the body may be a servant and
   not a master. When you deny yourselves in nothing, but satisfy every
   vain appetite, custom grows upon the soul, and intemperance proves a
   trade and a habituated distemper, so that you cannot when you would,
   upon prudent and pious respects, refrain and command your desires; and
   therefore it is good sometimes to thwart and vex the flesh, as David
   poured out the water of Bethlehem that he longed for, 2 Sam. xxiii. 17.
   Not to deny ourselves in what we affect and covet, lust grows into a
   wanton, and bold and imperious, and so prescribes upon us, and we are
   brought under the power' of these things.

   2. The business and cares of this world; for these immoderately
   followed, and not in obedience to God, are a sore burthen, and makes
   the soul heavy, and allows no time and strength for God and his
   service, and those happy opportunities of private communion with him.
   When we are encumbered with, much service,' we neglect that one thing
   necessary,' Luke x. 42; and therefore Christians must take heed that
   the lean kine do not devour the fat, that Sarah be not thrown out of
   doors instead of Hagar, that religion be not thrust to the walls, which
   should be our prime and chief business, while every business hath its
   time and course. The scriptures, knowing the proneness of our hearts to
   temporal things, deal with us as we do with a crooked stick; we bend it
   so much the other way, and therefore some times they forbid necessary
   labour: John vi. 27, Labour not for the meat which perisheth,' &c. The
   meaning is, not chiefly, but it bends the stick another way: Set not
   your affections on things on the earth.' A man must have some kind of
   affection to his work here below; but we had need to be bent the other
   way. We may gather this from this precept: It is better to encroach
   upon the world, than the world should encroach upon godliness. In
   short, things are a burthen and clog to us, according as our delight
   and scope is. If the pomp and increase of the world be our end and
   scope, then religion will be looked upon as a burthen, that will be a
   weight, and all duties of godliness as a melancholy interruption; as
   they, Amos viii. 5, When will the sabbath be over?' The exercise of
   godliness will be a troublesome thing, and we shall go about the work
   of religion as if we went about it not. But on the other side, if
   heaven and heavenly things be our scope, then the world is a burthen,
   and then we shall use it in the way, but not abusing, as taking up our
   rest here, 1 Cor. vii. 31, 32. Man hath a body and soul, and he doth
   provide for both; but for one in subordination: the soul is the chief,
   and therefore we must not so look after the interests and concernments
   of the bodily life as to forget the interests of the soul, or to
   neglect them. Many will not so grossly idolise present things so as to
   renounce things to come. Ay! but they so often follow the things of the
   world that they neglect their eternal concernments. The happiness of a
   people lies in communion with God, and therefore that must be looked
   after; we must take heed that the cares of the world have not such a
   hand and power over us as either to divert us from, or unfit us for,
   these higher and nobler pursuits, the enjoyment of God in Christ. This
   is the first thing the apostle speaks to these spiritual racers, to lay
   aside every weight; that is, the delights of the flesh and the cares of
   the world.

   Secondly, The next thing to be laid aside is sin, which doth so easily
   beset us.' As we must guard against things without, so we must mortify
   our corrupt inclinations within, or else it will soon make us weary of
   our heavenly race, or faint in it. Sin, you know, is twofold--original
   and actual. Actual sin is not meant primarily, for that is not peccatum
   agens, sin that easily besets us, but peccatum transiens, the sin that
   passes from us; and original sin is that which is emphatically called
   sin, Rom. vii. 8. Now this original corruption may be considered as
   merely native, or as acquired and improved into evil customs and
   habits; for according to men's tempers and constitutions, as they are
   severally disposed, so by the corruption of nature they are inclined to
   one sin more than another: as the channel is cut, so corrupt nature
   finds a vent and issue. In every man there is some predominant sin, and
   in every regenerate person some relics of that sin, from whence is the
   greatest danger of his soul; thus David speaks of his iniquity, Ps.
   xviii. 23. Well, then, this is that sin that doth easily beset us;
   original sin improved into some tyranny or evil custom, which doth
   increase and prevail upon us more and more. Now, this is said easily to
   beset us for three reasons. Partly because it hath a great power and
   restraint over us, and implies the whole man, the members of the body,
   the faculties of the soul; so great an interest hath it acquired in our
   affections, it doth easily beset us, it hath great power and command
   over us. Partly because it sticks so close that we cannot by our own
   strength lay it aside: Jer. xiii. 23, Can the Ethiopian change his
   skin, or the leopard his spots?' &c. A man can as soon change his skin
   as lay aside his customs, that are so deeply engraven as the blackness
   of an Ethiopian or the spots of the leopard. And partly because it
   mingles itself with all our motions and actions, Rom. vii. 21, &c. It
   easily besets us, it is present with us, it impels us, and solicits us,
   and draws us to sin further and further, and doth make us negligent in
   what is God's; we cannot do or speak anything but it will infest us in
   all our duties of piety, charity, justice; on every side it is
   interposing, vexing, thwarting the motions of the Spirit, and so abates
   our strength, vigour, and agility, and retards our course towards
   heaven and glory. Therefore lay aside, as every weight, so every sin,
   &c.

   Quest. Now, what is it to lay aside, or how can we lay aside, since sin
   sticks so close to us, and is engraven in our natures?

   Ans. Certainly something maybe done by us, for this is everywhere
   pressed as our duty: Eph. iv. 22, Put off the old man;' and 1 Peter ii.
   11. We may put it off more and more, though we cannot lay it aside.
   Then we are said to lay aside the sin that so easily besets us, when we
   prevent and break the dominion of it that it shall not reign over us:
   Rom. vi. 12, Let not sin reign,' &c. Though it dwells in us, lives in
   us, and works in us, yet it should not overcome us and bring us into
   bondage, and so it will not be imputed to our condemnation; and at
   length, when the soul shall be separated from the body, we shall be
   wholly free from it.

   Quest. Ay! but what must we do that we may so repress it (the question
   returns), that we may break the dominion of it?

   Ans. I answer--This is the work of the Spirit of God; but we must know
   the Spirit of God doth work the work of mortification two ways--by
   regeneration and after regeneration. By regeneration, and so he doth
   immediately, without any co-operation of ours, mortify the deed of sin,
   gives sin its death-wound: that which is left is as a thing mortified,
   it is broken. The scripture often speaks of this first work of
   regeneration: Rom. vi. 6; Col. ii. 11. First, when we are planted into
   Christ, then we put off the body of sin; and though it doth not
   presently die, yet it is weakened, that it cannot reign, though it be
   not destroyed.

   2. After regeneration the Spirit doth more and more destroy sin, the
   relics of sin, this crucified body of sin, till it dieth wholly away;
   this he doth in us, but not without us: Rom. viii. 13, Through the
   Spirit mortify the deeds of the body.' Not the Spirit without us, nor
   we without the Spirit, but ye through the Spirit.' What is then
   required of us?

   [1.] Seriously purpose not to sin, and promise to God to yield him
   unfeigned obedience. Especially should we make this promise in the use
   of those solemn rites by which the covenant between God and us is
   confirmed. Take up a solemn purpose not to grieve the Spirit, nor to
   break his law: Ps. cxix. 106, I have sworn, and I will perform it, that
   I will keep thy righteous judgments.' This purpose of heart is the root
   of all good actions; therefore, in the confidence of God's help, in the
   sense of thy own weakness, Ps. cxix. 32. We cannot lay wagers upon our
   own strength, yet it is our duty to engage our hearts to God. To sin
   against the light of our own conscience, and illumination of the
   Spirit, and the chastening and instruction of our own reins, that
   aggravates our sin; but to sin against and besides our fixed purpose of
   not sinning, that lightens sin; for then it is a sin of weakness and
   infirmity, not of wilfulness and malice. And then we can say, as Paul,
   Rom. vii. 19, when the heart is fixedly bent towards God, The evil
   which I would not, that do I.' Two ways may we be said to sin against
   purpose: either when we are overborne besides our purpose, our purpose
   still remains to please God; as when the water breaks over the bank,
   the bank remaining; in such a case the fault is not in the bank, but in
   the violence of the flood; or, secondly, when we break off our purpose,
   or consent to do evil; as when we cut through the bank the water may
   easily make through. There is a great deal of difference between sin
   dwelling in us, and sin entertained by us, between sin remaining and
   sin reserved. When you have a firm purpose against all sin, there is
   sin remaining, but it is net reserved, it is not kept and allowed.

   [2.] Watch over thyself with a holy self-suspicion, because thou hast
   sin within thee that doth easily beset thee; therefore consider thy
   ways,' Ps. cxix. 59; guard thy senses, Job xxxi. 1; but, above all,
   keep thy heart, Prov. iv. 23. Conscience must stand porter at the door,
   and examine what comes in and what goes out Watch over the stratagems
   of Satan, and seducing motions of thy own heart.

   [3.] Resist and oppose strongly against the first risings of the flesh
   and the tickling and pleasing motions of sin that doth easily beset us
   when it doth entice us away from God, or to do anything that is
   unseemly and contrary unto the duties of our heavenly calling. Oh!
   remember we are not debtors to the flesh, Rom. viii. 20. Thou art tied
   to the Lord by all obligations and indulgence; therefore break the
   force of sin by a serious resistance; check it, and let thy soul rise
   up in indignation against it: my business is not to pleasure the flesh,
   but to please the Lord.

   [4.] Bewail thy involuntary lapses and falls with penitential tears, as
   Peter went out and wept bitterly,' Mat. xxvi. 75. Godly sorrow is of
   great use for laying aside of sin, as salt potions kill worms. When
   children are troubled with worms we give them salt potions; so these
   bitter penitential tears are the means God hath appointed to mortify
   sin. That is the reason the apostle saith, 2 Cor. vii. 10, Godly sorrow
   worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of.' It is not only
   a part of repentance, but worketh preserving durable resolutions, a
   walking closely with God; it is a means God hath blessed to this end
   and purpose.

   [5.] Recover from thy falls, renew thy combat; as Israel, when they
   were overcome in battle, they would try it again and again, Judges xx.
   28. Take heed of ceasing for the present; for though thy enemy seems to
   prevail, though the flesh seems to prevail against the spirit in the
   battle, yet thou shalt have the best of it in the war; by the power of
   grace thou shalt have the victory.

   Thus have I gone over the privative part of our duty: Let us lay aside
   every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us.' I should have
   come to the positive: Let us run with patience the race that is set
   before us.' There is the duty, let us run the race that is set before
   us; and there is the manner of the duty, let us run with patience. I
   should have shown you that a Christian's life is like a race from earth
   to heaven, in a way of holiness and exercise of grace. This race it
   continues as long as we continue in the world, from our nativity to our
   death; after death the strife is ended. Now, in this race we must run,
   and so run that we may obtain the crown, 1 Cor. ix. 24. Running is a
   motion, and a speedy motion; there is no lying, sitting, or standing,
   but still there must be running. We must make a further progress in the
   way to heaven, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
   forth unto those things which are before,' Phil. iii. 13.

   The runner was not to inquire how much of the way already was past, but
   to strain himself to overcome what was yet behind. And so should we
   consider what sins are yet to be mortified, what duties yet untouched,
   almost untouched; what hard conflicts are yet to be under gone, and
   still to hold on our way without turning aside or halting because of
   difficulties, discouragements, stumbling-blocks. And there are fellows
   and co-partners with us that run this race, with whom we may strive in
   a holy emulation who should go forwardest, who should be most forward
   in the course of pleasing God. O Christians! there are many contentions
   amongst us, but when shall we have this holy contention? Heb. x. 24. In
   a race there is the agonotheta, the judge of the sports; so here God
   observes all. No matter what the standers-by say, the judge of the
   sports must decide who must have the crown, 1 Cor. xiv. 3, 4. And then
   at the end of the race there is the crown: 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8, I have
   fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;
   henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,' &c. In a
   race there are spectators; so there are here God, angels, and men: 1
   Cor. iv. 9, We are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men,'
   &c.

   Thus, for the similitude of our race in our way to heaven. Now wherein
   it differs.

   This is a race, not undertaken out of wantonness, but out of necessity.
   God hath called us to this course; and if we run not in this race, we
   are undone for ever. And in other races but one had the crown; here all
   are crowned, 2 Tim. iv. 8, though they be not so eminent as the
   apostle. Here all are crowned that run in the manner God hath required:
   Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
   the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but
   unto them that love his appearing.'

   For the manner, with patience: Let us run with patience.' Patience is
   necessary:--

   1. Partly because of the length of the race, and the distance between
   us and the promised reward. Our race cannot be ended but after some
   degree of time; long waiting is troublesome to the flesh, and therefore
   we have need of patience.

   2. Because we meet with many impediments, troubles, and temptations by
   the way; there are spiritual adversaries with whom we must fight; for
   we go on, we not only run, but fight; therefore run with patience.'

   3. Because the spectators will be ready to discourage us. We are set
   forth not only as a spectacle to God and angels, but to the world; and
   they will be ready to deride, scorn, and oppose us for our zeal to God,
   and our forwardness in the ways of God, to discourage us by bitter
   mockings. &c.; therefore Let us run with patience the race that is set
   before us.'

EDITORIAL NOTE.

   THE following sermon appears to have been preached by Dr Manton on
   occasion of the death of a Christian lady. It was reprinted in 1694, in
   the following circumstances:--Dr Manton's daughter was Mrs Terry. She
   died in 1689. Her husband afterwards married a daughter of Mr Thomas
   Burroughs. This second wife died in 1693. On occasion of her death a
   small volume was published, containing a brief account of the two
   ladies, this sermon, and a number of papers from the pen of the second
   Mrs Terry. It is from this volume that the sermon is now reprinted. We
   have not seen a copy of the original edition.

A FUNERAL SERMON.

   And they that weep as though they wept not.--1 Cor. VII. 30.

   I SHALL insist upon that clause at this time. In it I shall observe:--

   1. A concession. He grants them some kind of sorrow and grief.

   2. A correction. He moderateth it.

   1. He grants them some kind of sorrow, in that he puts weeping for
   adversity, the affection for the condition, the effect for the cause,
   as allowing them a holy sensibleness of their misery: they that weep.'

   2. Then he correcteth and moderateth this sorrow: as if they wept not;'
   because he will not trust such a dangerous weapon in their own hands,
   and leave the Corinthians to the vileness and waywardness of their own
   affections: though I allow you to weep, yet it is as if you wept not.

   The points are two:--

   I. That God alloweth, yea, requireth of his people some sorrow and
   sensibleness of their condition.

   II. That the heart must be so managed under this sorrow, that we may be
   said not to weep, rather than to weep, at the same time; it must be
   with such moderation. Or thus: Christians should so sorrow, under the
   sense of their condition, as if they did not sorrow. I shall speak
   briefly of both these.

   Doct. 1. God requireth and alloweth some sorrow: They that weep.'

   I shall--(1.) Show you that God doth so; (2.) Show you what this sorrow
   is.

   1. To prove that so it is, I will not stand to instance places of
   scripture in a point so familiar.

   The reasons are:--

   First, This is the end why we have affections, that they may be
   exercised in their season. God hath planted in every man affections
   suitable to every condition in which he placeth him. It is said, The
   stars in their order fought against Sisera;' so affections. We have joy
   for prosperity, sorrow for adversity. What did God mean to give us such
   contrary affections, if not that they should be acted in their order
   and time? that these affections should, like the spokes, turn with the
   wheel of Providence? And therefore God complaineth much, as if he were
   frustrated of his end, when we do not answer Providence by an exercise
   of those affections that are suitable to it; as Jer. v. 3, I have
   smitten them, and they have not grieved,' God wondereth they should be
   so unnatural as not to grieve when stricken by him. So for mercy: Hosea
   xi. 3, I taught Ephraim to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew
   not that I healed them:' that is, they were not sensible of it, did not
   take notice, and were not suitably affected with the love of God. They
   are ranked among the rest of men that are under their natural
   condition, who are astorgoi, without natural affection. To be flinted,
   horny-hearted, such as have no smartness, no quickness of affection,
   especially when the misery is of such a nature that near friends are
   taken from us, is very displeasing to God.

   Secondly, Because that due exercise of sorrow under affliction is very
   serviceable and beneficial to the soul. (1.) To help spiritual duties.
   Anima nunquam melius agit, quam ex impetu insignis alicujus
   affectus--the soul works best when it hath the advantage of an
   affection. When the soul is made better by the bitterness of grief we
   feel, and the soul maketh the affection of sorrow to be vehiculum, a
   kind of chariot to carry on the work of repentance: Jer. ii. 19, Know
   and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken
   the Lord thy God.' When the iron is hot, if you strike in you may get
   good; take the advantage of your hearts under your sorrows.

   Thirdly, To make it serious. Sorrows gather the soul together, and make
   it more itself: a man cometh to himself in his grief. Usually God
   taketh this course with his people; though they begin in the flesh they
   end in the spirit. Sorrow maketh reason to stand still. Solomon
   speaketh of bethinking themselves in the land of their afflictions, 1
   Kings viii. 47. Jolly persons are slight, never think upon anything.
   Those that wallowed in pleasures did put far away the day of the Lord,
   Amos vi. 3. Till the prodigal was tamed by outward grief and want, he
   never had thoughts of returning. They that did not grieve when God
   struck them, Jer. v. 3, refused to receive correction. The more
   sorrowful the mind is, the more serious. Sorrow drieth up all those
   swimming thoughts and pleasing imaginations by which men drive away
   their time and divert their care; and therefore there is a great deal
   of benefit comes by it; it puts the soul in an advantageous way of
   receiving good.

   Fourthly, This would double the affliction, not to grieve for such
   things as nearly touch us. To break the bent and course of nature is
   dangerous; affections, when strongly stirred, must have their exercise,
   for fear of greater harms. It is an ease sometimes to mourn; strangled
   grief chokes the heart. 1 Sam. xxv. 37, Nabal's heart became as a stone
   within him when he heard tidings that mightily affected him; it had
   been better he had wept and mourned, as chirurgeons first let the sore
   soften before they begin to draw it. Job ii. 13, Job's friends said not
   a word to him the first seven days, for they saw that his grief was
   great; they let sorrow have its course for a while. Stop floods in
   their full career, and they rage and swell; when the death of a near
   friend hath opened the sluices, let the waters play a little in the
   channel till it be calmer; passions spend and tire themselves in their
   exercise; grief is sometimes eased by the expression of it. There is
   reason too for it, if that of Cardan be true, that a heavy heart is
   eased by nothing so much as by sighs and tears; because tears empty the
   head of some vapours with which it is surcharged, and sighs lighten the
   heart of some fuliginous damps that oppress it. These are nature's
   offers for ease; you see the reasons.

   2. What grief and sorrow this is that God alloweth and approveth. What
   is sinful grief I shall show you in the next point: here what is lawful
   and required.

   I answer--Not every sorrow, for there is lupe` pro`s tha'naton, as well
   as pro`s theo`n, a godly sorrow and a worldly sorrow: 2 Cor. vii. 10,
   Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, riot to be repented of:
   but the sorrow of the world worketh death.' In the general it must be a
   godly sorrow. In these respects:--

   [1.] You must see somewhat of God in the affliction. It is a motive
   this on both hands, both to sensibleness and patience, that it is from
   God: Heb. xii. 5, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,'
   because it is from God. A man slights every ordinary chance, but when
   it is from God, then it worketh more effectual upon the spirit. As we
   see in the case of the Philistines, 1 Sam. vi. 9. If that stroke that
   happened upon them were a chance, they would trouble themselves no
   further about it, but if it were from the God of Israel, they would
   advise about sending home the ark.

   [2.] It must be serviceable sorrow, to set you the nearer to God.
   Sorrow is of the nature of those things that are required, not for
   themselves, but pro`s allo`, for some farther thing. You must not rest
   in your sorrow, but make use of it, that it may work kindly, employ it
   about the work of the sanctuary. Do not cherish your affections for
   their own sakes, but so as they may be helpful to the soul. Do not go
   about to still the affection, to think that is all that is required;
   let it do the soul service, and be glad you have your hearts under such
   an advantage. You know how Joshua served the Gibeonites; he did not
   slay them, but condemned them to be hewers of wood and drawers of water
   for the sanctuary. Grief and sorrow, well managed, will make a good
   drawer of water for the sanctuary. Make your sorrow your servant now to
   draw water for you, to make you smart and bleed for a good use and
   purpose. There is a gracious promise to them that sow in tears: Ps.
   cxxvi. 5, They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.' Now we are in
   tears, but we do not sow tears; tears are not seed, we have not the
   crop. But what shall we do to make them seed? Spiritualise them, make
   them spiritual tears; let the water run in a holy channel, and then,
   like the waters of the sanctuary, they will be healing waters. The
   death of a friend, though never so dear to us, will never cause any but
   carnal tears; they minister a good occasion of mourning, but they do
   not minister a cause and ground of mourning; it is good to distinguish
   between the cause and the occasion. At such a time God calleth for more
   than ordinary sensibleness and sorrow; but not because he hath declared
   his pleasure concerning our friends; that is murmuring, not mourning.
   We should take this occasion in deed, but our sorrow should work upon a
   spiritual ground and object.

   First, We should take this occasion to mourn for our own sins; miseries
   are but the effects of sin. You should labour to make sin bitter by
   your present feeling. There should be, I say, a special renewing of our
   repentance by such providences; experience teacheth best. Now you see
   what sorrow sin bringeth; if men would but improve their occasions of
   sorrow thus, their hearts would be more keen against sin. It is a great
   argument to make men continue in a course, when it never proveth evil
   to them: therefore God challengeth them: Jer. ii. 5, What iniquity have
   you found in me, that you depart from me?' Just as a martyr said, I
   have served Jesus Christ these many years, and should I deny him now?
   But if men would thus observe these experiences, sin cannot make this
   challenge. We can say of sin, Thou hast killed my husband or wife at
   such a time; my daughter, my brother, at such a time, &c.; consider and
   say, Have not I provoked God to remove the comfort of a parent or near
   relation from me? It is said of Gideon, Judges viii. 16, that with
   briars and thorns he taught the men of Succoth. So God many times
   teaches us.

   Secondly, We should take this occasion to weep for the public
   abominations. When Polus the tragedian was to act a mournful part, he
   brought in the urn, or the pot of ashes of his own dead son; that drew
   real tears from him. We are all to act a mournful part now, even to
   mourn for our abominations before the Lord. It may be your grief is
   flat and low; awaken it by these private instances. But take heed, let
   it not stay there; this is but to give the occasion; some other thing
   must be the cause and the object of it. Oh, pour out a little water
   upon the public sins; they are sparks that we have kindled! As the
   prophet speaks: Isa. l. 11, Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, and
   compass yourselves about with sparks.' It is meant of sins; not, as it
   is wrongly expounded, of walking in our own duties. Well, pour out this
   water upon these sparks. When a town is on fire every one will bring
   his bucket. Why, when the whole kingdom is compassed about with these
   sparks God giveth you these private occasions that you may bring your
   bucket to quench the common flame. So Luke xxiii. 28, Weep not for me,
   but weep for yourselves and for your children.' Alas! who could choose
   but shed tears to part with such a blessed companion as our Saviour?
   Yet not for me, saith he, but for the survivors. Weep for your sins and
   calamities that are coming upon you; let such an occasion open the
   floodgates, but then cut out a passage for them, that they may run this
   way.

   Thirdly, For the public miseries. Private sorrows should be swallowed
   up in the public. Look, as private mercies are no mercies, unless it be
   well with Sion; and therefore it is annexed as a special blessing, Ps.
   cxxviii. 6, that they should see their children's children, and peace
   upon Israel.' Defensive love is strong always, but in these times more
   strong, because every one expected the Messiah to come of his race. But
   that is nothing without peace upon Israel; it is not a consummate mercy
   without that. Private griefs are nothing in comparison of the miseries
   of Sion: 1 Sam. iv. 21, The glory is departed! the glory is departed!'
   Though she lost a father, lost a husband, that was sad; but she
   reflects upon the principal cause of grief, the misery of the church of
   God. So see Jer. xxii. 10, Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan
   him; but weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more
   to his native country,'--not for good Josiah, but the misery of wicked
   Shallum. Thus it must be godly in respect to the end, to draw you to
   God these ways.

   Use 1. It condemneth that slightness of spirit that is in most persons.
   God entereth into their families, and taketh hence a principal pillar,
   a husband or wife, but they are not affected with it; they carelessly
   slight it, as if nothing had been done, or some chance had befallen
   them. A Roman bragged, Se nunquam cum matre, &c. [26] They may say they
   were never comforted, they never needed it; they lay nothing to heart.
   Brethren, the use of divinity indeed is to compose and still the
   spirit, not to make it stupid. I am sorry that I am forced to speak
   anything to trouble you; I had rather comfort; but there is no true
   rest where there hath not been a due trouble, therefore I must a little
   speak against this stoical patience and insensibleness. And because
   discovery of sin doth more wound the heart than all the forcibleness of
   expression we can use, I shall not cudgel it with barren invectives,
   but labour to discover this sinful careless insensibleness to the
   heart, and distinguish it from a holy patience. I have been often upon
   such like subjects, therefore shall say the less now. I shall
   difference it chiefly in their grounds.

   1. This slightness proceeds:--

   First, From want of consideration. There can be no patience where there
   is no sense of evils. They will not give their thoughts leave to work
   upon such objects. I do not say we must make it the cause or object of
   our mourning, yet I say we must make it the occasion; this must awaken
   sad thoughts in us about our own sins or others' sufferings, but they
   will not think of it. These are such as are described by the prophet to
   put far away the evil day,' Amos vi. 3; that is, all consideration of
   God's dealings with them or others.

   Secondly, From indulging pleasure. A voluptuous spirit is an insensible
   spirit: Eph. iv. 19, Who, being past feeling, give themselves over to
   work uncleanness with greediness.' So it is said, Hosea iv. 11,
   Whoredom and wine do take away the heart;' that is, all smartness and
   quickness of affection. When the soul is sleeping in pleasure, there is
   a brawniness brought over it. Pleasure is the drunkenness of the soul,
   and a drunken man feeleth nothing: Prov. xxiii. 35, They have stricken
   me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt
   it not.'

   Thirdly, Vain thoughts: Jer. iv. 14, How long shall vain thoughts dwell
   within thee?' Evil workings of spirit, either seeking a way how they
   may get out, or contriving how it maketh for their worldly advantage.
   The devil darts evil thoughts in us, how a cross by some sinful course
   may work for our temporal good, our state be augmented thereby, or
   capable of further contentment and advancement in the world.

   2. Christian patience cometh from this ground; it doth not exclude a
   sense of evil, but a quieting of the heart against evil. These are the
   grounds and workings of the thoughts.

   First, It seeth God in it: 1 Sam. iii. 18, It is the Lord; let him do
   what seemeth him good;' Ps. xxxix. 9, I was dumb, and opened not my
   mouth, because thou didst it.'

   Secondly, It seeth God acting with sovereignty: Dan. iv. 35, None can
   stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?' Job ix. 12, Behold,
   he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him What doest
   thou?' Job xxxiii. 13, What, dost thou strive with him? he giveth no
   account of his matters.'

   Thirdly, This sovereignty mollified with attributes; as--

   [1.] With infinite justice: Dan. ix. 14, The Lord our God is righteous
   in all the works which he doeth;' just and righteous in all his ways.
   It is just because God doeth it; his will is the measure of his
   actings: Deut. xxvii. 15, All the people to say, Amen;' it is just,
   Lord.

   [2.] With infinite wisdom: Isa. xxviii. 29, He is wonderful in counsel,
   and excellent in working.' He knoweth what is better for you than [27]
   you yourselves; for God hath the bowels of a mother, so the wisdom of a
   father.

   [3.] With infinite love. It looketh upon God as a father: John xviii.
   11, The cup that my Father hath given me, shall I not drink of it?'
   though a bitter cup, it is from my Father.

   [4.] With infinite faithfulness: Ps. cxix. 75, I know thy judgments are
   right, and that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.' It looketh
   upon afflictions as a means in God's hands. I proceed to the second
   point:--

   Doct. 2. That Christians ought so to sorrow under the sense of their
   afflictions as if they did not sorrow.

   Their affections must be moderately exercised. Having in the former
   point showed what sorrow may be allowed, or is required of a Christian,
   I shall show you here what sorrow is disallowed or unlawful.

   1. Such as overwhelmeth and dejecteth the spirit, so as you are not
   your own man. This is called a fainting, or a sinking of the soul under
   affliction: Heb. xii. 5, Faint not when thou are rebuked of the Lord.'
   As we must not slight it, so we must not faint under it. Fainting is
   quando anima dejicitur de statu, when the soul is put out of the
   condition of a free soul, and delivered over to the possession of
   another. God hath given every man this fee-simple, to possess himself.
   Now we are not ourselves when we are overcome with grief and sorrow;
   and therefore it is said, Luke xxi. 19, In patience possess your
   souls;' implying that a man hath not the use and command of his soul
   when he is overcome with grief; it doth as it were dispossess a man of
   himself. You know, of a drunken man we say, he is not himself, because
   he hath not the free use of his reason. Now this being over whelmed
   with sorrow is expressed in scripture by this very term, being drunk;
   as Isa. lxiii. 6, I will tread them down in mine anger, I will make
   them drunk in my fury;' that is, bring such affliction as they shall
   not be able to enjoy themselves under it, to have the free use and
   exercise of their reason.

   2. Such as is peevish: when men indulge themselves in their disquiets,
   and will not hearken to what might make for the settlement of their
   souls; when the heart yieldeth to passion, and huggeth grief, and will
   not let it go. There is a great deal of pride and stomach in men
   against God's dispensations, and therefore the prophet expresseth that
   intolerable misery that should light upon her children by the
   stomachfulness that was in Rachel: Jer. xxxi. 15, Weeping for her
   children, she would not be comforted.' Men have no ear to hearken to
   what may be said for God, and therefore are resolved to hold the
   bitterness of their own thoughts. This stubborn pettishness and wilful
   grief may be sometimes in God's own chosen. It was in Jacob, Gen.
   xxxvii. 35; he refused to be comforted; for he said, I will go down
   into the grave unto my son mourning.' I will; it was a stomached,
   wilful grief. Christians, by a perverse, peevish justifying of their
   passions, they say of their sorrows as Jonah did of his anger: Jonah
   iv. 9, I do well to be angry.' When men take it for granted they do
   well in it, they resolve then to shut their ears against whatever might
   appease and quiet their thoughts.

   3. Such as are impatient and discontented, as if God had not dealt
   wisely or worthily with them. When a full vessel is shaken the water
   will plash over; and when there is such a tumult in the heart, unseemly
   expressions will drop from us, as if God should not have dealt thus
   with us as to take away these comforts in which were all our solace,
   the staff and the stay of the family. We, that are neighbours, are apt
   very often, in discontent, to say, What a serviceable and useful person
   hath God taken away, and so many bad ones left! as if God had not made
   a right choice. Foolish man would be accounted wiser than God; but if a
   man were well skilled in God's attributes he would never murmur,
   especially if he did but consider this cometh from a wise God. The
   cause of all the disorder in the heart is the want of fearing God's
   name; we are not skilled in his attributes. Alphonsus blasphemously
   said, Si in principio mundi ipse Deo adfuisset, multa melius
   ornatiusque condenda essent--things should have been ordered better if
   he had been of God's council. Many of you do not utter such
   expressions, but yet too often conceive such thoughts in your hearts.
   You will not think so; ay, but what mean the bleating of the sheep and
   the lowing of the oxen?--such expressions as these, Oh, would to God I
   had died first! as David, 2 Sam. xviii. 33, O Absalom, my son, my son!
   would to God that I had died for thee!' And again, Would to God I had
   been dead a long time ago rather than to survive my happiness; all my
   estate gone in an instant, as (brethren) in these empty, trying times
   it is many a man's case. But remember, foolish man, the all-wise God
   thought it fittest for thee. Yet thus doth the prophet Elijah, when he
   was driven into the wilderness by Jezebel, 1 Kings xix. 4, in a
   discontent, request for himself that he might die, It is enough now, O
   Lord; take away my life.'

   4. Such as unfit for duty. Affections are no further lawful than they
   fit for duty. When grief taketh off our hearts from the duties of our
   general or particular calling, it is an evil grief. See Gen. xxxv.
   19-21, Rachel died and was buried, and Israel journeyed and spread his
   tent. Having lost so dear a wife, he doth not stand puling by the tomb,
   but Israel journeyed, he went on about his business. We ought so far to
   be sensible of Providence as may serve to quicken us to duty, not to
   hinder us. There is a great question now, whether we ought to fear or
   hope in our misery: some of one side cry down fear; some on the other
   side cry down hope. Why, brethren, there is not much matter in the
   exercise of either of these affections, but according as they do more
   or less quicken you to duty. If you be the more earnest in prayer,
   because you hope success is near, truly that is a good disposition of
   heart; if because fear, that is the most unchristian. I confess, fear
   is good when it ends in duty. Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to
   seek the Lord,' 2 Chron. xx. 3; and Noah, moved with fear, prepared an
   ark,' Heb. xi. 7. Brethren, the bare exercise of affections is but a
   natural and an indifferent thing; the great trial of them is when they
   fit you the more for the service that God requires of you. Therefore,
   when persons grieve so for the loss of a husband, wife, children, or
   estate, that they have no mind to pray, no mind to go about their
   callings with any comfort, that is an evil grief. It is true that God
   winketh at some omissions of duties for a small while in such cases,
   till we are able to manage our thoughts and digest our sorrow; and the
   letter of the law giveth place to such great necessities. As Aaron's
   excuse is but reasonable, Lev. x. 19, Such things have be fallen me
   this day; and if I had eaten the sin-offering, should it be accepted
   with the Lord?'--the death of his two sons: though he held his peace,
   he could not tell how for the present to frame his heart to a joyful
   duty. As if a minister cannot tell how to bring his heart to preach, if
   God hath entered upon his family, taken away a wife or children thence.
   I confess this cometh from corruption, but in such cases God winketh at
   it for a short time. The reasons are:--

   [1.] Because otherwise our carriage would be very dishonourable and
   derogatory to Jesus Christ, as if he were not better to us than all the
   comforts that we lose: 1 Sam. i. 8, as Elkanah said to Hannah, Why
   weepest thou? am not I better to thee than ten sons?' So why weepest
   thou? Is not Christ better to thee than ten wives, ten children, ten
   parents, a thousand times as much as thou hast lost? If we had but
   faith to see it, Christ is to a believer whatever he wanteth. The
   people of God in the wilderness wanted houses: Ps. xc. 1, Lord, thou
   art our habitation.' A Christian hath never more comfort than when he
   seeth that particular thing made up in Christ which was taken from him
   by the providence of God. If a believer has lost her husband, she seeth
   Christ her husband. So for any other relation; if a parent, seeth
   Christ his parent; if a brother, Christ is a brother. We are to Christ
   instead of all these relations, and therefore why should not Christ be
   so to us? See Mat. xii. 50, Whosoever doth the will of my Father, the
   same is my brother, and sister, and mother.' Mark, we are so to him,
   and therefore why should we not account Christ to be so to us?
   Certainly it is a great dishonour and disparagement to him if we do not
   see all our losses abundantly made up in him.

   [2.] It would be a dishonour to our profession. It is a credit to
   Christianity that the professors of it can be joyful in all conditions:
   Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,' arpa'gen;
   though all they had were snatched from them by rude hands, yet they
   were joyful. Let guilty Cains look with fallen countenances, Gen. iv.
   6. Let the pharisees please themselves in their sour looks, Mat. vi.
   16. A Christian's countenance should show him to be above his misery,
   sprightly and cheerful. Though you take away their coat, as Joseph's
   mistress did, you cannot take away their comfort; they are glad they
   can escape with their conscience, though they should leave their coat
   behind them. I remember Scaliger playeth the critic with Homer, because
   champion Achilles is brought in weeping; his beloved Brisëis was taken
   from him. So it is a disgrace to our high profession when a Christian
   is brought in dakru'sas, weeping; it is beneath you. It is said in Acts
   v. 41, They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that
   they were counted worthy to suffer for Christ.' Philpot's stocks in the
   Bishop of London's coal-house were but a pair of organs, as he saith.
   Nor is it true only in these honourable sufferings for the glory of our
   religion, but in the strokes of Providence in this very business of
   deceased friends. The apostle makes it the property of pagans to mourn
   excessively: 1 Thes. iv. 13, Sorrow not as those that have no hope,' i.
   e., as pagans; they did abound in it: as see Gen. l. 3, compared with
   ver. 10. Joseph mourned for Jacob but seven days, the Egyptians
   seventy, even ten times as much. Nay, pagans err so much this way, that
   if they could not find grief they would force grief; and therefore, at
   their funerals, if they had no sympathy, they would flash their faces
   and cut their flesh, that they might be sorrowful: And therefore God
   saith, Deut. xiv. 1, Ye shall not cut yourselves and make baldness in
   your eyes for the dead; ye are the children of the Lord your God;' that
   is, you have higher principles, you know such sorrow needless. And
   hence was it that the primitive Christians were wont to sing triumphant
   psalms at funerals, as it appeareth out of many places of Chrysostom,
   to show they had higher hopes of their departed friends.

   [3.] It is very prejudicial. You have no benefit, but a great deal of
   hurt by it, 2 Cor. vii. 10. There it is summed up in one word, Worldly
   sorrow worketh death;' that is, chiefly, sorrow for worldly things,
   that works death temporal and eternal in its desert; temporal death as
   it exhausteth the spirits, wasteth the marrow. Worldly sorrow leaveth a
   very strong impression upon the body, as Solomon saith, Prov. xvii. 22,
   A broken spirit drieth the bones;' it dulleth and deadens the heart. If
   a man would not save his tears, yet he should reserve them, keep them
   up for holy uses. God may give you many spiritual occasions to empty
   your bottle; do not be over-free of them. Affections over-exercised are
   usually restrained against the next occasion. And as they procure death
   in respect of the vigour of the body and soul, so an eternal death too;
   it deserveth it. And so the apostle is to be understood; for he
   opposeth it to godly sorrow, which here after you shall see you have no
   cause to repent of, as you have of worldly. Grief is a most serious
   passion; and though a man may forget himself in his joy, he should not
   forget to think of the danger; worldly sorrow worketh death.

   [4.] It is very unreasonable. If men would cite their affections before
   the tribunal of reason, and ask them what is the matter why they are so
   violently stirred, they might discern much of their folly: Ps. xlii. 5,
   David calleth himself to an account, Why art thou so disquieted, my
   soul? why art thou cast down within me?' Ask why it is, and you will
   see either no reason, or a corrupt one. Iniqua lex est quæ se examinari
   non patitur, saith Tertullian; and so it is an evil heart that will not
   be called to an account. Suspect those passions that are loth to be
   examined. Do but ask yourselves, Why do I grieve now? you shall see the
   answer will be foolish, unreasonable, unthankful, or savouring of
   discontent. Why, it may be you will say, Many dear comforts are taken
   from me. O brethren, that is an ill expression; no outward comfort can
   be taken from a Christian. We should live in such a continual waiting
   for God's pleasure, and in such a quiet submission thereunto, as not to
   look upon our comforts as taken from us. Job indeed useth the word, Job
   i. 21, The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken;' but he useth it so as
   if he would be understood as if the Lord had accepted of the
   resignation; for he blesses God for it. Even our highest comfort, our
   lives, the lives of the saints, are not taken from them; God doth but,
   as it were, accept of the resignation. As Stephen, Acts vii. 59, Lord
   Jesus, receive my spirit.' So Rev. xxii. 20, Even so, come, Lord Jesus,
   come quickly.' It is said of the wicked indeed, that their lives are
   snatched or taken away: as Job xxvii. 8, What hope hath the hypocrite
   when God taketh away his soul?' or snatcheth it away. So Luke xii. 20,
   Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee,' apaitousin
   apo` sou--they shall challenge and get away thy soul from thee.
   Therefore we should resign up our holy friends to God, as well as they
   do themselves. But let us see how unreasonable this very particular is
   of mourning for the dead.

   Is it to do them good? They are not the better for our tears, they are
   past recovery by our weeping. Is it not to envy their blessedness to
   wish them alive again? 2 Sam. xii. 23, Wherefore should I fast? can I
   bring him back again? I shall go to him, he shall not come to me.' Is
   it because they were so good that we mourn? The better for God; they
   are gone to their own home. Is it because so bad? 2 Sam. xiii. 39.
   David was comforted concerning Amnon, because dead, though he died in
   sin. Or is it because they died so soon which heightens your loss?
   Consider who decreed it; are you wiser than God? Is it for your own
   good you weep? That is an holy weeping: Weep as if you wept not.' Thus
   if men would expostulate with themselves, they would see the
   unreasonableness of their sorrow; it is to no purpose. We express
   things to no purpose by water spilt on the ground: certainly tears in
   such cases are but spilt water.

   Use 1. To instruct you to take home this lesson, so to sorrow under the
   sense of your afflictions as if you did not sorrow, be the loss what it
   will; though I shall chiefly speak to the present occasion. Do not let
   the grief oppress your heart. Ay! but how shall we do so? I shall give
   you some motives; as--

   1. Be sure to get an interest in spiritual mercies. The doctrine saith,
   Christians ought so to sorrow as if they sorrowed not. We cannot speak
   to others in this language, unless we should persuade men to slight the
   hand of God. We throw bones to dogs, but bread to children. We cannot
   comfort you in a carnal way: Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my
   thoughts within me thy comforts refresh my soul.' Mark, thy comforts.
   To comfort a man's self upon carnal grounds argueth an insensibleness
   of God's hand, and it is a shrewd sign that God gives us over to
   ourselves. Therefore, if you take comfort, take it from your interest
   in spiritual mercies. If you cannot look upon them under a condition of
   propriety as yours (as every Christian cannot), yet at least so far
   look upon them, that from thence all your comfort must be fetched. It
   is a neglect of providence to go away with a general thought. We must
   not sorrow too much, and yet we are to consider whether we have good
   ground why we should be comforted. God giveth wicked men these
   experiences of sorrow that he may awaken them, and show them there is
   no comfort to be had thence whence they would fetch their comforts, in
   carnal delights: Isa. lvii 21, There is no peace, saith my God, to the
   wicked.' There is a peace in their fancies and conceits, but no peace,
   saith my God.' There is a great deal of hurt done this way by sermons.
   Ministers instruct men in a moral way, that they should not grieve too
   much; but they do not instruct a man upon what grounds he should not
   grieve: you must be sure of better mercies, or at least look after them
   for your comfort. A man that has an interest in Christ is tetra'gonos
   ane`r, a four-squared man, unmoved in all conditions. There can be no
   peace between a man's affections and condition till there be a peace
   between him and God. Mark that, Eccles. ix. 7, Go thy way, eat thy
   bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now
   accepteth thy works.' When God accepteth us, we may then eat our bread
   with a merry heart, let things fall out how they will.

   2. Live in a continual expectation of the creature's change. Things are
   not half so burdensome when we look for them. A burden cast upon a
   man's back breaketh it; but when it is compacted and fitted for his
   shoulders, he goeth away well enough with it. It was some solace that
   Job could say, Job iii. 26, The evil that I feared is come upon me.'
   Suppose it be your own or your friend's dissolution, live in a
   continual readiness to part with life, or anything else, at God's call
   and intimation, and it will not be so grievous to you when it comes.

   3. Learn a holy greatness of mind, to be able to live above the
   creature. Consider the happiness of man is in God alone: all happiness
   consisteth in conformity to, and communion with, God, the chief good;
   so that though the creature be gone, your happiness is not gone. That
   troubleth a man most when his happiness is gone , he will not care so
   much for other things. It is good to see by what enjoyment they reckon
   themselves happy; if to have husband, wife, or a house well furnished,
   everything to our command, then when God taketh away these things your
   comfort is gone. There is much of people's conceits this way. But
   consider, what do you reckon the best of your enjoyments? that you have
   God for your portion: Ps. cxliv. 15, Happy is the people whose God is
   the Lord.' So see Ps. xxx. 7, Thou didst hide thy face, and I was
   troubled.' Set but the heart right in this point, and it will be well.
   Grace is but the change of a man's chiefest good and utmost end; that
   is only the difference between a natural man and a spiritual man about
   the conceits of happiness.

   There are other considerations--as the shortness of our misery, the
   continual abode of other comforts with us; though some be gone, we are
   not left naked to the world; the happy end of all, the good of our
   souls. But this for a taste.

   Men will think a sermon is to no purpose that is spoken to comfort
   persons in this kind. To this end:--

   1. Consider there is none of us but may have need of comfort one time
   or other; though our mountain standeth strong for the present, it may
   be removed, and it is good to lay up against a dear year. Such truths
   are most welcome when they come in their season.

   [1.] Consider you may have a season when it will be necessary for you:
   Who knoweth what a day may bring forth?' The woman that entertained the
   prophet, he would fain do her good. No, saith she, 2 Kings iv. 13, I
   dwell among mine own people.' But now that very woman, as in 2 Kings
   viii. 5, She cried to the king for her house and her land;' she that
   did not stand in need of the prophet, stood in need of the prophet's
   man. You have your wife, your children, and friends about you. Oh,
   there may a time come when you will be glad of one drop of this comfort
   to support you when they are gone.

   [2.] Consider, when it is upon you, you will find it the hardest thing
   in the world truly to assuage your grief, to grieve so as if you did
   not grieve. Afflictions are evil, and we are apt to make them worse, to
   turn wormwood into poison: Heb. xii. 11, No chastening for the present
   but will seem grievous.' Seneca could slightly speak of miseries when
   he had the use of rich gardens about Home; but when he had lost all, he
   was as much to seek as others.

   Now I shall apply all that hath been spoken to this present
   occasion:--1st, To show you why we should mourn; 2dly, Why mourn so, as
   if we did not mourn.

   First, Why we should mourn. Consider, we have lost a pious neighbour,
   and that deserveth sensibleness.

   1. Because such are a great loss; we have lost her service, help, and
   the benefit that we might have had by her. There is no member of Christ
   but one way or another is useful to the community; and indeed we found
   her to be so. We lose an example, we lose useful conference, we lose
   the pledge of a blessing to a family, to a neighbourhood. May we not
   say of her as of David: Acts xiii. 36, After he had served his
   generation by the will of God, he fell asleep'? She did serve her
   generation, and it was her grief that she did it no more and better; it
   should be ours that she did it no longer. Serviceable Christians are a
   great loss, especially in these times of need.

   2. It is a sad intimation to us, and therefore we ought to be very
   sensible of such a loss: Isa. lvii. 1, The righteous perish, and no man
   layeth it to heart, none considering that they are taken away from the
   evil to come.' Wicked men think they are the bane of a place: Plurimos
   defecit Christiani nominis gratia; Christianas ad leones. Wicked men
   are but preserved in reference to the godly; they are but as a fence of
   thorns about a garden of roses. Now when the roses are cropped off,
   what shall become of the thorns but be cast into the fire? God will
   dash the potter's vessel: Gen. xix. 22, Haste thee, escape to Zoar, for
   I cannot do anything till thou be come thither.' I cannot, mark that:
   Exod. xxxii. 10, Let me alone, and I will make of thee a great people,'
   God offereth Moses composition: Acts xxvii. 24, The Lord hath given
   thee all them that sail with thee.' These are the staff and the stay,
   therefore we have reason to be sensible of their removal from us.

   Use 2. We have reason also to be comforted.

   First, For the glory that cometh to God by her sweet departure. Those
   that have envied her life, may wish for her death, even such solace as
   she felt in the most bitter agonies: Num. xxiii. 10, Let me die the
   death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his.' It is a
   great comfort that wicked men have not wherewithal to blast religion,
   when they see how the love of God can compose our spirits in the
   greatest extremities that befall us either in life or death.

   Secondly, That she hath left us for glory. It was indeed through many
   throes, and pains, and sorrows; but death played the midwife, to help
   her into glory. It is the apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians,
   first epistle, chap. iv. ver. 13, that they should not sorrow, even as
   others which have no hope concerning them which are asleep in Jesus;
   but admonish them to comfort one another with these words, that at
   Christ's coming, they which survive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so
   shall we be ever with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one another with
   these words.'

THE SAINT'S TRIUMPH OVER DEATH.

   But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.--1 Cor. XV. 57.

   THESE words are a part of Paul's epini'kion, or triumphant song. In the
   song there are two parts, and this is the last.

   1. A confident challenge.

   2. A solemn thanksgiving.

   The one is directed to the enemies, the other to the Giver of victory.

   1. A confident challenge, in which he outbraveth death and all the
   powers of the grave: O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
   victory?' The words allude to Hosea xiii. 14, wherein Christ is brought
   in speaking, I will ransom them from the power of death, and redeem
   them from the grave: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be
   thy destruction.' There is Christ's engagement and undertaking for a
   full conquest of death; Christ threateneth death, and the apostle
   insulteth over it. The form of the words is altered, because the enemy
   was now fallen, and Paul proclaimeth the victory. Hitherto death and
   the grave had insulted over the misery and frailty of mankind; all the
   tombs and charnels of the world were but so many monuments of death's
   conquests. Golgotha, the place of skulls, seemed to be designed on
   purpose to upbraid and discourage our Redeemer; so many skulls and
   rotten relics of human frailty as there were in that place, so many
   trophies and monuments of triumph did death produce before the eyes of
   Christ; as if it were said to him, Canst thou, darest thou, grapple and
   enter into the lists with such an enemy? But our Lord was not
   discouraged: when he ascended upon the cross, he did as it were answer
   these bravings of death thus: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave,
   I will be thy destruction;' and because he was as good as his word, and
   every way performed his engagement, the apostle, as one of Christ's
   followers, cometh and insulteth over this proud adversary that was now
   fallen, O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'

   This challenge is illustrated by a prolepsis, or an anticipation of an
   objection. Some might ask, What is this sting of death? what is this
   power of the grave? The apostle answereth, The sting of death is sin,
   the strength of sin is the law.' Death cometh to have this power by
   sin, and sin to have this power by the law.

   The sting of death, ke'ntron, the prick. It implieth both the stroke of
   death and the anguish of it, as in the sting of a serpent, there is the
   deadly touch and the pain and torment of the wound; and so it noteth
   the power of death over us--the prick or weapon by which it striketh is
   sin: Rom. v. 12, By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin'--and the terrors and horrors of it, which also do arise from sin.
   Now, by horrors, I mean not only the natural aversion, retirement, or
   flight of the spirits, but the bondage, torment, and despair that is
   upon the conscience. As death is a penal evil, inflicted by the justice
   of God, guilt maketh death terrible, so that a sinner is all his
   lifetime subject to bondage,' Heb. ii. 14, 15, and kept under an awe of
   judgment to come. It is not always felt, but soon awakened, especially
   in sickness and approaches of death. When we feel the cold hands of it
   ready to pluck out our hearts, conscience is whipped with a scourge of
   six strings--fear, horror, distrust, grief, rage, and shame.

   The strength of sin is the law. How is that to be understood? The law
   giveth strength to sin, ratione cognitionis, obligationis et
   augmentationis; they are the words of a German divine, [28] and will
   yield us a fit method wherein to open this matter.

   [1.] The law discovereth sin, and maketh it appear in its own colours;
   the more light and knowledge of the law, the more sense of sin, as in
   transparent vessels dregs are soon discerned: Rom. vii. 9, I was alive
   without the law, but when the law came, sin revived, and I died.' When
   by a sound conviction disguises are taken off from the conscience, we
   find sin to be sin indeed. Paul was alive before, that is, in his own
   hopes, as many a stupid soul maketh full account he shall go to heaven,
   till conscience be opened, and then they find themselves in the mouth
   of death and hell.

   [2.] The law giveth strength to sin in regard of the obligation of it;
   it bindeth over a sinner to the curse and wrath of God. God hath made a
   righteous law, which must have satisfaction, and till the law be
   satisfied, we hear no news but of a curse, and that maketh death to be
   full of horrors: Heb. x. 27, There remaineth nothing but a fearful
   expectation of the fiery indignation of the Lord.'

   [3.] It augmenteth and increaseth sin by forbidding it; lusts are
   exasperated and rage upon a restraint, as the yoke maketh the young
   bullock more unruly. Now, put all together, and you will understand the
   force of the expression, The strength of sin is the law.' The discovery
   of the law stoppeth the sinner's mouth, and the curse of the law
   shutteth him up, and holdeth him fast unto the judgment of the great
   day, by which restraint sin groweth the more raging and furious; Jill
   which put together make death terrible; not an end of misery, but a
   door to open into hell.

   Now, this being the case of every man, what shall we do? and how shall
   we extricate our souls from such a labyrinth of endless horror? You
   have an answer to that in the next verse in the apostle's thanksgiving,
   where he acquainteth you not only with grounds of hope, but triumph:
   Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.'

   In this thanksgiving you may observe:--

   1. The author of the mercy: God, by Jesus Christ.

   2. The manner how we come to be interested in it: He giveth us
   victory.' Or rather, you may observe:--(1.) The act of the Father as to
   Jesus Christ, in that he appointed him to get the victory. (2.) The act
   of the Father as to us, in that he applieth this victory to our souls.
   Christ's victory, and the application of it, are the two grounds of
   this thanksgiving.

   1. Christ's victory over sin, death, and the law, for it must be
   extended to all the things mentioned in the context; they are enemies
   by combination, and knit together in a fast league. The law giveth
   strength to sin, and sin giveth a sting to death; as long as the law
   hath power, sin will be strong, and as long as sin hath strength, death
   will be terrible. But Christ hath overcome death; he foiled it in his
   own person, as I shall show you anon fully; and for sin, he hath taken
   away the guilt of it by his own merit, and will destroy it more and
   more by the power of the Holy Ghost. When he stood before the tribunal
   of God, he stood there as a surety and undertaker: Heb. vii. 22, A
   surety of a better testament.' Now, he was a surety, mutually God's and
   our's, to work God's work in us, and our work for us. Among other
   things which he undertook there, he undertook the abolition of sin: on
   God's part, he obliged himself that it should be performed by his
   Spirit; on our part, he obliged us to endeavours of mortification. Now,
   because Christ is an able surety, the work is as good as done already:
   Rom. vi. 6, Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
   the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
   sin.' Mark, it is crucified with him,' as implying his undertaking upon
   the cross, that the body of death might be destroyed;' as noting the
   work of God's Spirit, which was engaged and made sure by Christ's death
   upon the cross, that we should not serve sin;' as noting the
   concurrence of our endeavours, to which we are obliged by the same
   sponsory act of Christ. Thus much Christ hath done for the abolition of
   sin; now for the law. That was an enemy that could not be over come,
   but must be satisfied, and so it was by Christ, who both performed the
   duty and sustained the penalty of it, chiefly the latter; and therefore
   it is said, He was made a curse for us,' Gal. iii. 13. The sting is
   lost in Christ, and the honey left for us. But this is matter of
   another respect and cognisance.

   2. The next reason of the apostle's thanksgiving is the application: he
   hath given us victory;' for understanding of which you must note that
   (1.)--Christ's victory is imputed to us as if it were done in our own
   persons. When we are actually united to him, we are possessed of all
   his merit. Christ fought our war, and joined battle in our stead. We
   have a mystical victory in Christ, and are said to overcome when Christ
   overcame. This is the reason why the acts of believers are complicated
   and folded up with Christ's acts in the expressions of scripture:
   Crucified with him,' quickened with him,' and raised with him,' and set
   down with him in heavenly places,' Eph. ii., &c.--all which are terms
   proper to the judicial union, which is different both from the moral
   and mystical, as I could easily show you, were it not a matter of
   another nature. Now this mystical victory is of great use to a believer
   in time of discouragements. If the law challenge, Satan and conscience
   say, Thou art a sinner under a curse, thou mayst answer, I am a sinner,
   but I am crucified in Christ, in my surety--his payment and suffering
   is mine. If death or the world discourage, you may say, This is a
   beaten enemy; I foiled it in Christ, I ascended in Christ, &c.

   (2.) The benefit of this victory is imparted and applied to us, by
   which he maketh us conquerors over sin and death. All Christ's work was
   not done upon the cross; there is much to be accomplished in our
   hearts: Rom. xvi. 20, The God of peace shall tread Satan under your
   feet,' &c.--not only under Christ's feet, but ours; as Joshua called
   his fellows to come and tread upon the necks of the Canaanitish kings:
   Josh. x. 24, Come, put your feet upon the necks of these kings;' so
   Christ will see us conquer. He that got a victory for us, will get a
   victory in us, over sin, and death, and hell. Christ hath trodden them
   under foot already when his own heel was bruised, Gen. iii. 15; now he
   will do it under your feet.

   Having laid this foundation, the point and head of doctrine which I
   shall discuss is, Christ's victory over death for the comfort and
   profit of believers.

   Death is either the first or second, temporal or eternal. Sinners are
   under the sentence of both, and both are in a sort put into the hands
   of Satan; he hath the power of death,' Heb. ii. 14, as God's
   executioner; and the one maketh way for the other. Death to the wicked
   is but a taking them away to torment, as unruly persons are committed
   to prison that they may molest no more. God's patience expireth with
   their lives, and then his vengeance beginneth. The curse of the first
   covenant was eternal death: Gen. ii. 15, Thou shalt die;' that is,
   eternally. The curse must carry proportion with the blessing; the
   blessing was eternal life, and the curse was eternal death. I say the
   sorrow and pain must have been perpetual, answer able to the life which
   he should have enjoyed; therefore Christ is said to have delivered us
   from wrath to come,' which certainly was our portion and inheritance by
   Adam; and without Christ there is no escape. But to come to
   particulars, I shall show you:--

   1. How Christ delivered us from death.

   2. How far.

   1. How he delivered us. The apostle answereth that, Heb. ii. 14, By
   death he destroyed him that had the power of death.' Now Christ's death
   cometh under a twofold consideration as a merit, or as a glorious act
   of war and combat; as the act of a Redeemer, or the act of a conqueror,
   which answereth to the double evil in death. It is a natural evil, and
   a penal evil It is a natural evil, as it is the dissolution of soul and
   body; it is a penal evil, as it is a curse of the covenant, or the
   punishment of sin. (1.) There was merit in Christ's voluntary death--it
   was a ransom for the elect. He died not only in bonum eorum--for their
   good and profit, but loco et vice omnium--in their room and stead. As
   when the ram was taken, Isaac was spared so Christ's death was instead
   of ours. God will not exact the debt twice, of us and our surety: Job
   xxxiii. 24, Deliver him from going down into the pit, for I have found
   a ransom.' The sinner must die, or the surety. Now, saith the Lord, I
   accept of the death and passion of Christ for this penitent man. If we
   go down to the pit, we go not down by way of vengeance. By Christ's
   death the merit of our sin is expiated, justice satisfied, God's wrath
   appeased, the law fulfilled, sin pardoned, and so the jaws of death are
   broken. Death in itself is the sentence of the law, the fruit of sin,
   and the recompense of angry justice, and so it hath no more to do with
   us, for God hath found a ransom.' (2.) You may look upon it as the act
   of a conqueror. Christ foiled death in his own person. Ever since he
   rifled the grave, death hath lost its retentive power: Acts ii. 24,
   lusas tas odinas tou thanatou, loosing the pains,' &c. It is an
   allusion to the throes of a travailing woman. The grave was in travail
   till this precious burden was egested, for he could not be holden of
   it, and ever since the grave is a womb rather than a dungeon and pit of
   vengeance. Non vitam rapit, sed reformat (Prudentius). It doth not
   destroy life, but renew it. In almost the same metaphor Christ is
   called The first-born from the dead,' Col. i. 18; not that he was the
   first that was raised from the dead, howbeit he was the first that
   arose. Others were raised by the power of another, but Christ arose by
   his own. So he is called, 1 Cor. xv. 20, The first-fruits from the
   dead.' As the offering of the first-fruits was a blessing to all the
   store, so Christ dying and rising is a ground of conquest to all the
   elect. Christ before his death had been combating with the powers of
   darkness and all the subordinate instruments. Death was Satan's beast
   of prey that was set upon him; but our Lord foiled it in its own
   dungeon. The battle between Christ and death was begun upon the cross;
   he grappled with it there, and they went tugging and wrestling to the
   grave. Christ, like a prudent warrior, carried the war into his enemy's
   country, and there got loose of the grasp of death, foiled it in its
   own territory. He arose, and left death gasping behind him; so that the
   quality of the grave is quite altered. Before it was a prison, Satan's
   dungeon; now it is a chamber of repose, a bed of ease, ever since
   Christ slept there. When the prophet speaketh of Christ's resurrection,
   he saith, Isa. liii. 8, He shall be taken from prison and from
   judgment'--by prison meaning the grave; but speaking of the death of
   the faithful, he saith: Isa. lvii. 2, They shall rest in their beds.'
   It was for a while to Christ a prison, that to us it might be a bed of
   ease.

   2. The next question is, How far he hath delivered us from death? We
   see the godly are obnoxious to the changes and decays of nature, yea,
   to the strokes of violence, as well as others; and how are we
   delivered? I answer--It is enough that the second death hath no power
   over us,' Rev. xx. 6; nothing to do with us, Rom. viii. 1, oude'n
   katakrima, not one condemnation,' &c. We may die, but we shall not be
   damned; and though we go to the grave, yet we are freed from hell. But
   this is not all. In the first death believers have a privilege--they do
   not die as others do.

   [1.] The habitude and nature of it is changed. That which is penal in
   death is now gone. It is not a destruction, but a delivery. Believers
   have wrong thoughts of death. We are delivered from it as it is a
   punishment and a curse. Now it is a blessing, one of Christ's legacies
   to the church: 1 Cor. iii. 22, All things are yours.' While death was
   in the devil's hands it was an enemy; but it is made a friend and a
   blessing in Christ, a passage from the vale of tears to the kingdom of
   glory, the end of a mortal life, and the beginning of that which is
   immortal. As Haman to Mordecai, it intended a mischief, but it proveth
   a privilege. To a wicked man it is properly an execution, but to the
   godly a dismission of their souls into the bosom of Christ: Luke ii.
   28, Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace;' they quietly send
   away their souls, but a wicked man's soul is taken away. It is twice so
   expressed: Luke xii. 20, This night shall they take away thy soul from
   thee;' and Job xxvii. 8, When God taketh away his soul,' &c. They would
   fain keep it longer, but God taketh it away whether they will or no. A
   godly man resigneth, and sendeth away his soul in peace. His life
   cannot be taken away--it is only yielded up upon the call of
   providence; and he dieth, not because he must die, but because he would
   die. He may die sooner than he thought, but not sooner than he would;
   for when God willeth it, he submitteth. But to return. The blessing of
   death lieth in three things:--

   (1.) The funerals of the godly are but the funerals of their sins and
   frailties and weaknesses. Peccatum moritur, miseria moritur, homo non
   moritur. It is not the man dieth, but the sin, the misery dieth. All
   other means and dispensations do but weaken sin, but death destroyeth
   it. When God justifieth, the damning power is gone; when God
   sanctifieth, the reigning power is gone; but when by death we come to
   be glorified, then the very being of it is gone. When the house was
   infected with leprosy, so as scraping would not serve the turn, it was
   to be digged down; we are so infected with sin that all other remedies
   are too weak, nothing but death will serve the turn. When ivy is gotten
   into a wall, it cannot be wholly destroyed till the wall itself be
   demolished: cut off the stump, the body, the boughs, the branches,
   still there are some strings that are ready to sprout again. So it is
   here, original sin cannot be destroyed, the constant groans of the
   faithful are, Who shall deliver us from this body and mass of sin?'
   Rom. vii. 24. But now death is a sudden cure; sin brought in death,
   and, as it were in revenge, death destroyeth sin.

   (2.) There is a way made for a present and complete union of the soul
   with Christ: Phil. i. 23, I desire to be dissolved and be with Christ.'
   We are loosed from the body and joined to Christ. It is better a soul
   be separated from the body than absent from Christ. We have a union
   here, but not a presence. Now judge you, which is better,--to be
   present with the body or to be present with the Lord; to have the
   company of the body or the company of Christ? Here the soul is enclosed
   and imprisoned, as it were; but there thou hast the free enjoyment of
   Christ, without the clog of an earthly estate. The soul, as soon as it
   departs the body, goeth immediately to Christ. As when Potiphar's wife
   laid hold on Joseph's coat, he escaped, so you leave your upper garment
   in death's hand, but the soul flieth to God. The body came from Adam,
   and runneth in a fleshly channel, and what we had from Adam must for a
   while be mouldered to dust, to purge it from the impurity of the
   conveyance; but the soul, by a natural right, returneth to God who gave
   it, and by a special interest to Christ, that redeemed and sanctified
   it by his own Spirit.

   (3.) The body, which seemeth most to suffer, hath much advantage; a
   shed is taken down to raise up a better structure. It is sown a natural
   body, it is raised a spiritual body,' &c., 1 Cor. xv. 44. Here it is
   not capable of high enjoyments; it is humbled with diseases, unfit for
   duties. Again, It is sown a corruptible body, it is raised an
   incorruptible body.' Here it is liable to changes, there it may live
   for ever without change and decay. If we love long life, there is
   eternal life. It is carnal self-love that maketh us willing to abide in
   the flesh; if we did but love ourselves, but love our own flesh, we
   would not be afraid to die; for to die is to be perfected, to have body
   and soul free from sin and corruption.

   [2.] The hurt of it is prevented. As you are chosen and sanctified in
   Christ Jesus, it cannot hurt you. I say again, death may kill you, but
   it cannot hurt you, it hath no power over the better part. Like a
   serpent, it feedeth only upon your dust; nay, and for your bodies, that
   which dieth as a creature, is sure to live as a member of Christ. The
   Lord Jesus is our head in the grave; your bodies have a principle of
   life within them; believers are raised by the Spirit of holiness; the
   same Spirit that quickeneth them now to the offices of grace shall
   raise their mortal bodies. So Rom. viii. 11, He shall quicken your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.' The Holy Ghost can
   never leave his old mansion and dwelling-place. How many grounds of
   comfort have we against the mortality of the body! Christ is united to
   body and soul, and he will not let his mystical body want one sinew or
   joint. In the account that he is to make to the Father, he saith, he is
   to lose nothing,' John vi. 39. Mark, he doth not say none, but nothing.
   Christ will not lose a leg, or a piece of an ear. Again, God is in
   covenant with body and soul; when you go down to the chambers of death
   you may challenge him upon the charter of his own grace. God is the God
   of Abraham's dust, of a believer's dust; though it be mingled with the
   remains of wicked men, yet Christ will sever it, Mat. xxii. 32. Christ
   proveth the resurrection of the body by that argument, that God is the
   God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' The ground of
   the argument is, that God made his covenant not only with the souls of
   the patriarchs, but with their whole persons. Again, Christ hath
   purchased body and soul; so much is intimated in that place, 1 Cor. vi.
   20, Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your bodies.'
   Christ hath paid price enough to get a title to body and soul, and
   therefore he will not lose one bit of his purchase; the Lord will call
   the grave to an account, Where is the body of my Abraham, my Isaac, my
   Jacob? It is said, Rev. xx. 13, The sea gave up her dead, and the grave
   gave up her dead, and hell gave up her dead.' Let me note that hell is
   there taken for the state of the departed, or else what is the meaning
   of that passage that followeth afterward, and death and hell were cast
   into the lake that burneth'? &c. Well then, all the dead shall be cast
   up; as the whale cast up Jonah, so the grave shall cast up her dead.
   The grave is but a chest wherein our bodies are kept safe till the day
   of Christ; and the key of this chest is not in the devil's hands, but
   Christ's. See Rev. i. 18, I have the keys of death and hell.' When the
   body is laid up in the cold pit it is laid up for another day. God hath
   an especial care of our dust and remains; when our friends and
   neighbours have left it, Christ leaveth it not, but keepeth it till the
   great and glorious day.

   [3.] We are eased from the terrors and horrors of death. Death is
   terrible, as it is a penal and natural evil, as I distinguished before.
   (1.) As it is a natural evil. Death in itself is the greatest of all
   evils, phoberon phobero'taton, said an heathen (Aristotle), which, in
   Job's language, may be rendered, The king of terrors,' Job xviii. 14.
   We gush to see a serpent, much more the grim visage of death. Moral
   philosophy could never find out a remedy against it. Heathens were
   either desperate, rash, stupid, or else they dissembled their gripes
   and fears; but Christ hath provided a remedy, he hath delivered us not
   only from the hurt of death, but the fear of death: Heb. ii. 14, To
   deliver them from the fear of death, that all their lifetime were
   subject to bondage;' by his Spirit he filleth the soul with the hopes
   of a better life. Nature may shrink when we see the pale horse of death
   approaching, but we may rejoice when we consider its errand, it is to
   carry us home; as when old Jacob saw the chariots come from Egypt, how
   did his heart leap within him, because he should see his son Joseph.
   Death, however we figure it with the pencil of fancy, is sent to carry
   us to heaven, to transport us to Jesus Christ. Now, who would be afraid
   to be happy? to be in the arms of our beloved Jesus? Let them fear
   death that know not a better life. A Christian knoweth that when he
   dieth he shall not perish but have everlasting life,' John iii. 17. The
   world may thrust you out, but you may see heaven alluring, ready to
   receive you, as Stephen saw heaven opened, Acts vii. 56. There is an
   intellectual vision, or persuasion of faith, which is common to all the
   saints, though every one hath not such an ecstasy and sensible
   representation as Stephen had; yet usually in the hours of their
   departure faith is mightily strengthened, and acted so that they are
   exempted from all fear and sorrow. (2.) As it is a penal evil. It is
   sad when death is sent in justice, and clothed with wrath, and cometh
   in the quality of a curse. You know what was said before, The sting of
   death is sin;' they die indeed that die in their sins; death is a black
   and gloomy day to them, they drop down like rotten fruit into the lake
   of fire. Now Christ hath taken away the sting, the dolours and horrors
   of it; he hath taken away death as he hath taken away sin; he hath not
   cast it out, but cast it down, taken away the guilt and power of it,
   though not the being of sin: so the hurt, the sting is gone, though not
   death itself; it is like a serpent disarmed and unstinged, we may put
   it into our bosoms without danger. There are many accusations by which
   Satan is apt to perplex a dying soul; these make death terrible and
   full of horrors; but they overcome by the blood of the Lamb,' Rev. xii.
   11, and get the victory of these doubts and fears; when sins are
   pardoned fears vanish. Luther said, Feri, Domine, feri, absolutus sum a
   peccatis meis--Strike, Lord, strike; my sins are pardoned.

   [4.] It will be utterly abolished at the last day. We scarce know now
   what Christ's purchase meaneth till the day of judgment. It is said, 1
   Cor. xv. 26, The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death;' it is
   weakened now, but then it shall be abolished as to the elect: Rev. xx.
   14, And death and hell shall be cast into the lake of fire, this is the
   second death.' The dominion of death is reserved for hell; it must keep
   company with the damned, whilst you rejoice with God; for the present
   it is continued out of dispensation, it doth service to promote God's
   glory; but then the wicked must share death and hell amongst them, and
   be kept under a dying life or a living death: but all tears shall be
   wiped from your eyes,' Rev. vii. 17; death shall be no more, and you
   shall take the harps of God in your hands, and in a holy triumph say, O
   death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?' It is true
   we may say it, yea, and sing it now in hope, as some birds sing in
   winter; but then we are properly said to triumph.

   To apply it now.

   Use 1. Here is terror for wicked men. You may think it strange that I
   should draw terror out of such a comfortable doctrine; but consider
   Jesus Christ hath conquered death for none but those that have an
   interest in him; others, alas! are under the full power of it: for the
   present the case of wicked men is sad, in death it will be worse, in
   hell it will be worst of all. (1.) It is sad for the present; there is
   a bondage upon your souls, not always felt, but soon awakened; you
   cannot think of death and hell without torment; the thought of it, like
   Belshazzar's handwriting against the wall, smiteth you with trembling
   in the midst of all your cups and bravery; a small thing will awaken a
   wicked man's conscience, the fingers of a man's hand upon the wall.
   Belshazzar seemed a jolly fellow, a brave spirit, sets light by the
   Persian forces that were even at his door; but God soon taketh off the
   edge of his bravery, and then his joints trembled, his knuckles smote
   one against another for fear. If the Lord will but whist to conscience,
   the bravest spirits are soon daunced; [29] he needeth arm nothing
   against you but your own thoughts; certainly none but a child of God
   can have a true and solid courage against death; you cannot suppose it
   without consternation. David said, Ps. xxiii. 4, Though I walk through
   the valley of the shadow of death, yet I will fear no evil.' That is a
   grisly, sad, dark place to walk in, the very borders of death, side by
   side with terrors and destruction; yet there David would be confident:
   it is otherwise with wicked men; hereafter they would not live, and
   here they would not die. (2.) In death it will be worse, the nearer you
   draw to the everlasting estate, the more will conscience be opened, and
   scourge you with horror and remorse. I confess every wicked man doth
   not die sensible; some are stupid and foolhardy; they may sacrifice a
   stout body to a stubborn mind; but at last they die uncertain, doubtful
   if not anxious, and full of horror. As Adrian to his soul, O animula
   vagula, blandula, &c.--O poor soul! whither dost thou now go? thou
   shalt never sport it more, jest it more! Or, as he said, Anxius vixi,
   dubius morior; heu, quo vado!--I have lived doubt fully and die
   uncertainly; alas! whither do I go? A man that leapeth in the dark near
   a deep gulf, knoweth not where his feet shall light; and this is the
   case of wicked men. But this is not all; usually their death is full of
   terror. Things written with the juice of a lemon, when they are brought
   to the fire are plain and legible; so when wicked men are within the
   stench and smell of hell, they howl upon their beds; few or none are
   able to look death in the face with confidence. Oh! consider, when you
   come to die sin stareth in the face of conscience, and conscience
   remitteth you to the law, and the law bindeth you over to hell, and
   hell enlargeth her mouth to receive you; what will you do in such a
   case? Satan insulteth, your old tempter is become your new accuser;
   nay, you are at odds with yourself; the body curseth the soul for an
   ill guide, and the soul curseth the body for a wicked instrument. It is
   a sad parting when they can never expect to meet again but in flames
   and torments, and therefore curse the memory of that day whenever they
   were joined together. A godly man can take fair leave of his body:
   Farewell, flesh! go, rest in hope; thou shalt one day awake out of the
   dust, and then I shall be satisfied with God's likeness: I have a
   longing desire of thy re-union; we have lived together and glorified
   God together thus long; God will not suffer thee to see corruption, &c.
   (3.) In hell it will be worst of .all; envy will be a part of your
   torment as well as despair: Luke xvi. 23, it is said of the rich man,
   In hell he lifted up his eyes, and seeth Lazarus in Abraham's bosom,
   and saith, I am tormented in this flame.' It will be an additional
   torment to compare the believers' eternal happiness with your own
   misery: they are in the presence of God and his holy angels; you have
   no company but the devil, death, hell, and the damned, and are holden
   under the power of everlasting torments; you would not live and cannot
   die; when you have run through many thousands of years you cannot look
   for one minute of rest; conscience gnaweth more and more, you burn but
   consume not. Oh! it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the
   living God,' Heb. x. 31. Mark that attribute, living God. We do not
   speak in the name of an idol that cannot avenge his quarrel upon you,
   or of a God that shall die and suffer decay, but in the name of a
   living God, that liveth for ever to see vengeance executed upon his
   adversaries. There is no hope of release; as long as God is God, hell
   is hell.

   Use 2. It serveth to exhort us all to get an interest in this conquest
   of Christ. Every one is not fit to make use of Christ's victory over
   death; there are many things necessary to enjoy the full comfort of it.
   I shall name them:--(1.) A care to get sin pardoned. All the power of
   the devil and death hangeth on sin; therefore see sin buried ere thou
   art buried, or it will not be well with thee. There are two deep pits
   wherein you may bury your sins, and you shall never hear of them any
   more--the ocean of divine mercy, and the grave of Christ. See them
   buried in the ocean of mercy: Micah vii. 19, Thou wilt cast all their
   sins into the depths of the sea.' There is depth enough to bury them
   and drown them, that they may no more come into remembrance. Then there
   is the grave of Christ; the merit of Christ is a deep grave, deep
   enough wherein to bury all the sins of the world: Buried with him in
   baptism,' Rom. vi. 4. Otherwise, if this be not done, you will desire
   to be buried eternally, and never to rise more. Let me use one metaphor
   more in this matter, and it shall take its rise from that expression of
   the apostle, 2 Cor. v. 3; we shall be clothed upon,' saith he, if so be
   that we shall be not found altogether naked.' It is the great fault of
   Christians, when they come to die, they are to seek of a shroud, and
   are found altogether naked. It is uncomely to see a man in his
   nakedness; you should be wrapt in the winding-sheet of Christ's
   righteousness; there is no shroud like to that; come thus to the grave,
   and the grave shall have no power over you. But to leave the metaphor:
   This must be your great work and care, Christians, to reflect upon
   these things in the serious applications and discourses of faith, the
   infinite mercy of God, the abundant merit of Christ, and the
   sufficiency of his righteousness for your acceptance with God. (2.) Do
   not only act faith, but strive after assurance of God's love to your
   souls. Old Simeon said, Luke ii. 29, 30, Mine eyes have seen thy
   salvation; now let me depart in peace.' He held the Messiah not only in
   his arms, but in his heart, and then he could comfortably dismiss his
   soul. Now let me die,' said Jacob, when he had seen Joseph. He can
   never die too soon, as for himself, his own comfort and profit, that
   hath seen Jesus; his death is not untimely and immature, by what stroke
   soever he be cut off; whereas otherwise, if you live a hundred years,
   you die too soon if you die before you have gotten an interest in
   Christ: The sinner of an hundred years shall be accursed.' Old sinners
   that are left to be eaten out by their own rust, are chimneys long
   foul, and come at last to be fired. (3.) Mortify corruptions. Sin must
   die ere we die; he dieth well whose sins are dead before him. Either
   sin must die or the sinner. As the prophet said in another case, I say
   in this, Thy life must go for its life.' You will find those sins
   mortal that are not mortified. What should an unmortified man do with
   heaven? There are no sports nor carnal pleasures there; those blessed
   mansions seem to him but dark shades and melancholy retirements. The
   apostle hath an expression: Col. i. 12, He hath made us meet to be
   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.' We are first made
   meet for heaven before we enter into it; we are weaned from the world
   before we leave it. When men hang upon the world as long as they can,
   and when they can hang no longer, think then to make use of God, the
   Lord will refuse them with disdain: Go to the gods which you have
   chosen,' Judges x. 14; let the world now help you and save you. In
   short, a mortified man is prepared and ready; he doth but wait for wind
   and tide, and falleth like a shock of corn in season. (4.) A holy life
   and conversation. Men live as if they never thought to die, and then
   die as if they never thought to live. The best way to die well is to
   live well; they that are not ashamed to live are not afraid to die.
   Balaam desired to die the death of the righteous,' but would not take
   pains to live a godly life. Every man cannot say, Thanks be to God that
   giveth us victory by Jesus Christ.' You cannot die in Christ unless you
   live in him, and in the power of his life advance towards heaven. Oh,
   labour to exercise yourselves in these things, that you may be in a
   constant preparation. You never enter into the combat with death but
   once. It is impossible to mend oversights; either we are slain or saved
   eternally. Now, if you do what I have here exhorted you to, you may
   wait till your change come; and when it cometh, your last hour will
   prove your best.

   Use 3. It serveth to press God's children to improve the comfort? of
   Christ's victory; do not let it go out of your hands. (1.) Improve it
   for your friends that are departed in the Lord. Our weeping puts some
   disparagement upon Christ's conquest. Why should we weep in the day of
   their preferment, in the day of their solemn espousals to Jesus Christ?
   In the primitive times, [30] at funerals, they were wont to sing psalms
   of thanksgiving. We should bring them as champions to the grave, as
   those that have passed the pikes, and finished their course, and kept
   the faith, and have conquered the world, and sin, and death, and
   danger. Chrysostom, in one of his homilies on the Hebrews, speaketh of
   the ancient rites at funerals, of their hymns, and psalms, and praises:
   Haec omnia sunt laetantium, saith he--all these signify joy; and wilt
   thou weep and sing a psalm of praise and triumph at the same time? I
   confess it is said, Acts viii. 2, that devout men carried Stephen to
   his burial, and made great lamentation over him.' It is our loss when
   the church is bereaved of such excellent persons; there is cause of
   sorrow, but there should be a mixture; we should not mourn as those
   without hope, 1 Thes. iv. 13. As Christians must not rejoice without
   sorrow, so they must not be sorry without some mixture of joy. Let us
   declare that we hope for a resurrection, that we expect to meet our
   friends again in heaven; and when we weep, let it be like rain when the
   sun shineth. There should be somewhat of joy in our countenances, as
   well as tears in our eyes. (2.) Improve it for yourselves, and
   that--(1st.) In lifetime, that in your resolutions you may be willing
   to die. Many times we are like Lot in Sodom, or like the Israelites in
   Egypt, we could wish for Canaan, but are loth to go out of Egypt. This
   argueth little faith. Can we believe there is a heaven so excellent and
   glorious, and yet shun it? Can we hope for such an incorruptible
   inheritance,' 1 Peter i. 4, and yet be afraid of it? that we shall
   enter upon it too soon? What prince would live uncrowned? What heir
   would whine when he is called to come and take the inheritance? What
   thoughts have we of eternal life? Do we count it a privilege, or a
   misery and a burden? And again, it argueth little love. Can we pretend
   to love Christ, and be shy of his company? He should be unwilling to
   die that is unwilling to go to Christ. [31] And again, it argueth
   little judgment and consideration. Wherein is this life valuable? The
   world is nothing else but a place of banishment. Here is nothing but
   groaning; all the creatures join in comfort with the heirs of promise,
   Rom. viii. 23. What do you see in the world, or in the present life, to
   make you in love with it? Are you not weary of misery and sin? The
   longer thou livest thou sinnest the more. Certainly thou hast provoked
   God long enough already; it is high time to breathe after a better
   estate; and thou hast had taste enough of the world's misery and
   deceit, and of the frailties and weaknesses of the body. A longer life
   would be but a longer sickness. What is the matter that we are so loth
   to let go our hold of present things? If it be not want of faith or
   want of love to Christ, or too much love of the world, certainly it
   must be fear of death. And what a baseness and lowness of spirit is
   this, to fear an enemy so often vanquished by Christ and his saints? If
   you be at this pass, I have preached all this while in vain; and the
   victory of Christ, which I have discoursed of, is to little purpose.
   Oh! consider, generous heathens may shame you. You make all the
   provision of Christ in the gospel to be of less effect than mere moral
   principles. (2dly.) Especially improve this in the very season and hour
   of death. The great Goliath is now fallen, and you may come forth and
   look upon the carcase, Isa. lxvi. 4. Death itself, that startleth the
   creature, and seemeth to be the great check and prejudice of Christian
   hopes, is vanquished by Christ; therefore, in the very season when it
   seemeth to prevail over you, apply the victory, and say, Thanks be to
   God,' &c. When the pangs come upon you, remember this is death's last
   pull and assault; you may bear with it, it shall molest you no more; as
   Moses said, Exod. xiv. 13, The Egyptians which ye have seen to-day, ye
   shall see them no more again for ever.' So you shall feel these things
   no more. In heaven there are no groans, nor tears, nor sorrows; have
   but a little patience, and as soon as the last gasp is over, the soul
   shall be carried by angels to Christ, and by Christ to God. Believers
   have the same entertainment that Christ had; he was carried into heaven
   by angels: Dan. vii. 13, They brought him to the Ancient of days.' And
   so we are carried by angels into Abraham's bosom, Luke xvi. 22. They
   have a train to accompany them into heaven, as their friends accompany
   their bodies to the grave. And as Christ was welcomed into heaven with
   acclamations, and God saith, Sit down at my right hand,' Ps. cx. 1, and
   Ask of me, and I will give thee,' &c., Ps. ii. 8, so are believers
   welcomed: Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into thy master's
   joy.'

   What remaineth, then, but that we die by faith, as well as live by
   faith; but that we welcome death with confidence, and breathe out our
   souls in triumph? Moses, when he took up the serpent in his hand, it
   was but a rod; death thus welcomed and entertained by faith will prove
   at most but a correction, yea, rather a blessing of the covenant, a
   means of passage into glory.

   One thing I had almost forgotten, to press you to thankfulness to
   Christ. Oh! bless your Redeemer, that hath delivered you from the fear
   of death; admire his love and condescension, that he should come down
   from heaven and substitute himself in our room and place, and take the
   horrors of death into his own soul. It is said, Mat. xx. 28, The Son of
   man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his
   life a ransom for many.' Christ was a prince by birth, heir of all
   things, yet he came not in the pomp and equipage of a prince. If he had
   come in state to visit us, and to deliver comfort to us by word of
   mouth, it had been much; but Christ came not in this way, not in the
   pomp of a prince, but in the form of a servant, to minister to our
   necessities, and that in the highest way of self-denial; he gave his
   life as a ransom for many. Other princes are lavish of their subjects'
   blood, and care not how many lay down their lives for them: many give
   their lives as a ransom for the prince, but here it is quite otherwise,
   this prince layeth down his life to redeem the subjects, and he
   suffered death that it might not be terrible and destructive to us. Oh!
   blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ for this love for evermore.

   Some may expect that I should speak something concerning the servant of
   God, our dear brother now departed, but I need not say any more than
   what I have spoken already all along the discourse. I have indeed
   spoken of him, and that in the judgment of your consciences; the duties
   which I pressed upon you he performed; the comforts which I have
   propounded to you he enjoyed. I shall not make any particular rehearsal
   of the passages of his exemplary life: I judge it not convenient. Only
   to you of this place I may take liberty to commend his doctrine, and
   entreat you to be careful of those precious truths which he sowed among
   you while the Lord used him here as a skilful seedsman. God looketh for
   some increase, and taketh special notice of the time that you have
   enjoyed his labours: there is an exact account kept in heaven, as in
   that parable, These three years came I seeking fruit,' Luke xiii. 7;
   probably the three years of Christ's ministry are intended, for then he
   was entering upon his last half-year. God reckoneth how many years, how
   many months, your minister hath been with you, and accordingly doth
   expect fruit. Your pastor, a little before his suffering, professed
   high and worthy thoughts of you; let him not be deceived. It will be
   sad for you in that great day of separation, that when he expecteth to
   find you among the sheep, and to be his crown and rejoicing, he should
   see you among the goats. He will know you there; memory in heaven is
   not abolished, but perfected. I say he will know you, though without
   any lessening of is own happiness, or repining at God's righteous
   judgments.

THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

   To my Reverend and much-beloved Friend and Brother, Mr Elidad
   Blackwell, Preacher of God's Word at Andrews Undershaft, London,

   SIR.--I have at length sent you the copy of the sermon preached at your
   wife's funeral; dispose of it as you shall think good, either to your
   closet or the press. My judgment is for the former, but my affection
   will not suffer me to oppose, if you resolve upon the latter. If it may
   be any allay of your sorrow for your great loss, or of any use to the
   public, I shall not repent of the transcription of it. This, I may say
   with modesty enough, that the subject is useful and proper to the
   occasion. At the interment of my godly friend, who had so long waited
   on my ministry with savour and profit, what could I insist upon more
   seasonably, for your comfort and mine own, than the blessedness of
   those that live and die in the Lord? Now the blessing of the Lord go
   along with this discourse, whatever becometh of it, and make up this
   great breach to you with the more abundance of spiritual refreshings,
   which is the unfeigned desire of, sir, your true friend and
   fellow-servant in the Lord's work,

   Tho. Manton.

SERMON.

   And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the
   dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that
   they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.--Rev.
   XIV. 13.

   THE chief wisdom of a man is to live well and die well, to live godly
   and die blessed. The same corruption of nature that makes us unwilling
   to live well makes us unwilling to die. To forsake our corruptions, and
   go out of the world, are both displeasing to flesh and blood; therefore
   we need to be pressed often both to the one and the other, for the one
   maketh way for the other.

   Upon this occasion I know not a more seasonable argument. In autumn,
   when we see one leaf or a few leaves fall, we conclude the rest will
   follow afterwards. Every funeral should put us in mind that our death
   is not far off. Some of us have cause to expect the next turn. Old men,
   in scripture account, are as good as dead already, Heb. xi. 12. Those
   that lived longest died at last; Enos lived 905, Cainan 910, Seth 912,
   Adam 930, Jared 962, Methuselah, 969 years, but they all died. All must
   die; the great care should be to die well; none can die well but those
   that die in the Lord, for they are blessed; so it is proclaimed from
   heaven. Every divine truth comes from heaven; but some are more
   solemnly proclaimed from thence, as the mortality of man and the
   blessedness of the dead: the mortality of man, Isa. xl. 6, our
   affections are against the thought of that; the blessedness of the
   dead, in this place, against which carnal reason opposeth,--nature will
   so hardly believe that the dead can be blessed, that we need a voice
   from heaven to confirm it.

   The context speaks of many troubles to try the patience of the saints.
   Now the comfort propounded is the blessed estate of the departed. The
   worst that wicked men can do to the saints is but to help them the
   sooner to heaven.

   In the words observe a preface and a doctrine. The preface shows it is
   a matter of weight. Here is a voice from heaven, and a command to
   write, for the more assurance, an open publication.

   In the doctrine you have an assertion and an amplification. In the
   assertion, the qualification: the dead which die in the Lord; the
   privilege: are blessed. In the amplification you may observe:--

   1. The season: ap' a'rti, from henceforth.

   2. The confirmation: saith the Spirit; the Holy Ghost maketh affidavit.

   3. The parts of this blessedness, which are two--a release and a
   reward. A release: they rest from their labours; a reward implied:
   their works follow them. Death to the godly is not only an end of
   misery, but a beginning of glory and happiness. Philosophers could look
   upon it as the end of misery, but Christians look upon it as a be
   ginning of glory and happiness.

   Because I shall not be able to discuss the amplification, let me open
   some of the circumstances.

   Ap' a'rti, from henceforth.' Those that died in the Lord in former ages
   were blessed; but these times did require this singular comfort,
   because of the dreadful persecution, and that from those who carried
   the name of Christians. Now, saith the Holy Ghost, not only those that
   suffered by heathens are blessed, and counted the Lord's martyrs, but
   those that suffer also under pseudo-Christians. Some indeed carry it in
   another sense, as if it were said, before Antichrist be cast down, it
   will cost the church such a world of trouble that from hence forth you
   will count the dead happy, as being taken from the evil to come, Isa.
   lvii. 1. Others thus: from henceforth,' that is, after salvation
   offered to the Gentiles in the gospel, the dead shall be known to be
   happy; as the apostle saith that, 2 Tim. ii. 10, Life and immortality
   is brought to light in the gospel.' Others apply this from henceforth'
   to the time of their death, as if the saints were here asserted to be
   immediately happy upon their dissolution. But I think the first
   exposition most simple and genuine.

   Rest from their labours: troubles, services, the labours of their
   callings, the troubles of their condition. The godly are taken away
   from evil, and the wicked are taken away to evil. From glorifying and
   serving God they never rest, but from weariness in serving God, from
   weakness, sin, and distraction.

   Their works follow them. As it is said of wicked men, their iniquity
   shall find them out. We carry nothing out of the world with us but the
   conscience and comfort of what we have done for God; their wealth doth
   not follow them into the other world, but their works do.

   Doct. The point which I shall prosecute is the assertion of the text,
   that they that die in the Lord are in a blessed condition. I shall
   inquire:--(1). What it is to die in the Lord? (2.) Show you how they
   are blessed. (3.) Whence it is that they who die in the Lord are sure
   to be in a blessed condition.

   1. What it is to die in the Lord'? En kuri'o, may be rendered for the
   Lord,' or in the Lord;' as Eph. iv. 1, Paul, a prisoner in the Lord.'
   We render it of the Lord,' or for the Lord's sake.' 1 Thes. iv. 16: We
   render the dead in Christ' shall rise first; and ver. 14, those that
   sleep in Jesus,' which is to be preferred? I answer--Neither is to be
   excluded; whether a godly man fall as a peace-offering or as a
   burnt-offering, he is still in a happy condition.

   To die in the Lord' may relate either to the cause for which, or to the
   state wherein, or to the manner how, we die.

   [1.] The cause for which we die. So the martyrs die in the Lord, or for
   the Lord's sake; and are blessed of God, though, it may be, cursed of
   men. The text relates to the time of Antichristian persecution, when
   usually they died excommunicate or accused by the Roman synagogue. God
   hath a special regard to his champions that love not their lives to the
   death.

   [2.] The state wherein we die. So to die in the Lord is to die in the
   favour of God, in a state of peace with him as members of Christ's
   mystical body: they die in the bosom of Christ; sleep in Jesus, 1 Cor.
   xv. 18; are reconciled to God in and through him. There are two notable
   expressions which I shall commend to you upon this occasion. One is in
   the 2 Peter iii. 14: That we may be found of him in peace.' To die
   before the quarrel be taken up between us and God, that is sad. When a
   town is surprised by force, they that are taken with their weapons in
   their hands die without mercy; but blessed are they that die in peace.
   The other is in the 2 Cor. v. 3: That I may not be found naked.' To be
   summoned to come before God, and to have nothing to cover our
   nakedness, that is sad: it should be our care to be wrapt in Christ's
   righteousness; that is the best shroud for a dying Christian.

   [3.] As to the manner: they are said to die in the Lord who die in a
   gracious manner. It much concerneth us and the glory of God that we die
   well. A Christian is not only to live to the glory of God, but to die
   to the glory of God, for living and dying we are the Lord's, Rom. xiv.
   7, 8. As to the manner, to die in the Lord' signifieth--(1.) Our
   perseverance in communion with him; to continue our blessed fellowship
   with Christ to the death and in the death. Into the vineyard, Mat. xx.,
   some were called sooner, some later, but all continued to the end.
   Elisha would not leave his master till he was taken from him into
   heaven; so, till all be finished, we should follow our work close. Let
   us take heed,' saith the apostle, lest we seem to come short,' Heb. iv.
   1. As we should not come short, we should not seem to come short. Enoch
   lived a long while, but all that while he walked with God; three
   hundred and sixty-five years, a long age, but spent in communion with
   God, Gen. v. 22. (2.) It implies the solemn actings of grace at death.
   The scripture takes notice of the last words of saints; 2 Sam. xxiii.
   1, the last words of David. Death is a special season wherein to make
   use of grace, of faith, love, zeal, and obedience.

   (1.) Faith: Heb. xi. 13, All these died in faith.' It is not enough to
   live by faith, but we must also die by faith. This is a grace always of
   use on this side the grave; in the other world there is no need of it.
   When we come to enjoyment, faith ceaseth; at death it doth us the last
   office; we see what it is then to put the soul into God's keeping, 2
   Tim. i. 12; Luke xxiii. 46; Acts vii. 59. Then do we die in faith when
   we can resign our souls to God, and send our bodies to the grave in
   hope. While we are alive, we find it harder to depend upon God for
   daily bread than for eternal life, for herein faith is put upon a
   present trial; but when we come to die, the strength of our confidence
   is tried about the blessed recompenses. This then is to die in the
   Lord, when we can look beyond the grave and within the veil into the
   glory of the world to come.

   (2.) Love. In our readiness and willingness to be with Christ: Phil. i.
   23, I desire to be dissolved, and be with Christ;' the Spirit and the
   bride say, Come.' Now God takes you at your word, and you draw back.
   Let him be afraid to die that would not go to Christ.

   (3.) Zeal for God's glory. It is the last time you can do anything for
   God in the world. Put in a word for him, commend him to those about
   you, as Jacob doth the Mediator or the angel of the covenant, of whom
   he had such experience in the course of his pilgrimage, Gen. xlviii.
   16; and Josh. xxiii., Josh. xxiv., I am going the way of all the earth,
   and you know in all your hearts and all your souls not one thing hath
   failed of all the good things which the Lord your God hath spoken.' All
   is come to pass; not one thing hath failed thereof. Words of dying men
   are of most efficacy and authority, as being spoken out of all their
   former experience, with most simplicity, with out self-seeking or
   sinister ends, with most seriousness; for men entering upon the
   confines of eternity are wiser and more serious. It is no time to dally
   and dissemble at the last gasp. Speeches of living men are suspected of
   partiality to their present interests, or neglected as having no weight
   in them; but the speeches of dying men are solemnly observed. Therefore
   Joseph's brethren, to engage him the more, urge him with his father's
   dying charge: Gen. 1. 16, Thy father, when he died, said,' &c. Men, as
   they are returning pro's to` pro'gonon theion, to the original
   divinity, as Plotinus speaks, are supposed to be more divine, and
   therefore their dying words are much regarded. Put in then a word for
   God, an amen to the promises. Carnal men cannot honour their principles
   when they die; the world fails them when there is most need: Job xxvii.
   8, What hope hath a hypocrite when God comes to take away his soul?'
   When they are going out of the world, then they fall a complaining how
   the world hath deceived them; but a Christian, when he dies, he may
   honour his principles, commend the promises, give an account of the
   faithfulness of the Mediator, and plead for God at the last gasp.

   (4.) Obedience. A Christian is not to die like a beast, to be merely
   passive; his soul is not taken away, but yielded up; there is a
   resignation and consent on his part. A carnal man suffers death, but a
   Christian gives up the ghost. The scripture useth this distinctness of
   speech concerning them, as concerning the wicked. God takes away their
   souls, Luke xii. 19, Job xxvii. 8; they would fain keep them longer,
   but the Lord puts the bond in suit, and perforce they are dragged into
   his presence. But now death to the godly, it is a sweet dismission,
   Luke ii. 26. When they see the will of God, they hold out no longer;
   their souls are not taken away, but yielded up to God.

   Thus you see grace stands by us when all things else fail; it makes us
   live with comfort, and die with comfort. When wealth fails, grace fails
   us not. So much of the first question.

   2. How they are blessed. They are presently blessed upon the departure
   of the soul out of the body, but more blessed at the general
   resurrection of the just.

   [1.] Presently the soul is where Christ is; carried by angels to
   Christ, and by Christ presented to God, as the fruit of his purchase.
   That the soul is where Christ is, appears by that of Phil. i. 23, I
   desire to be dissolved and be with Christ;' to be with him in glory;
   otherwise it were a loss, not a happiness, for St Paul to be dissolved.
   It is a sorry blessedness to lie rotting in the grave, and only to be
   eased of present labours; for God's people are wont to reckon much of
   their present service and enjoyment of God, though it be accompanied
   with troubles and afflictions. Paul was in a strait, and he saith it
   was pollo mallon kreisson--much more better to be with Christ. A stupid
   sleep, without the enjoyment of God, is not much better than our
   present condition, but far worse. What happiness were that to be in
   such a condition, wherein we do nothing for God, enjoy nothing from
   God? Surely Paul would never be in such a strait if this drowsy
   doctrine were true, that the soul lies in such an inactive state of
   sleep and rest till the resurrection. This is to be no more blessed
   than stones and inanimate creatures, that feel nothing. Again, Luke
   xxiii. 43, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise,' saith Christ to
   the good thief. Some, to evade that place, refer semeron to le`go, as
   if it were, I say to thee this day; but the pointing in the Greek
   copies contradicts it, as also the sense of the place: semeron, this
   day, answers to the thief's, when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.'
   Christ promiseth more than he asks, as God doth usually abundantly for
   us above what we can ask or think. He hath reference to Christ's words
   to the high priest: the Son of man shall come in his glory. Now, saith
   Christ, I will not defer thy desire so long, for presently shall
   heavenly joys attend thy soul. Others seek to evade it by the word
   paradise;' it is a Persiac word, but used by the Hebrews for gardens
   and orchards, and by allusion for heavenly joys; and possibly the
   allusion might be taken not from the delights of an ordinary garden,
   but from Eden, or that garden in which Adam was placed in innocency.
   That by paradise is meant heaven, and not those secreta animarum
   receptacula et beatae sedes, some secret places for the repose of souls
   departed, which some of the fathers fancied, appeared by Paul's
   expression in 2 Cor. xii. 4. Speaking of his rapture, I was,' saith he,
   caught up into the third heaven,' which he presently calls paradise.
   Well, then, out of the whole we may conclude, that the souls
   immediately upon their departure out of their bodies are with Christ.
   Again it is said, Luke xvi. 22, The beggar died, and was carried into
   Abraham's bosom,' presently, in the twinkling of an eye, or turning of
   a thought. Thus it is with the saints, which is a great comfort. When
   you come to die, in a moment angels will bring you to Christ: agonies
   of death are terrible, but there are joys just ready; and as soon as
   you are loosed from the prison of your body, you enter into your
   eternal rest, the soul flieth hence to Christ. Once more, as the wicked
   are in their final estate as soon as they die, and therefore they are
   called the spirits now in prison,' 1 Peter iii. 19; so do the godly
   enjoy their glorified estate as soon as they die: The spirits of just
   men are made perfect,' Heb xii. 24. How can their spirits be said to be
   perfect, if they lie only in a dull sleep without any light, life, joy,
   delight, or act of love to God?

   [2.] They are completely blest at the resurrection. What their
   blessedness shall be then, we cannot now know to the full. We shall
   understand it best when the great voice calls us to come up and see;
   only because our ear hath received a little thereof, let me endeavour
   to lay it before you. In blessedness there must be:--(1.) A removal of
   all evils; (2.) A coacervation, and complete presence of all goods.

   (1.) A removal of evil. As long as the least evil continues, a man is
   not blessed, only less miserable. Haman had all things that a carnal
   heart could wish for; he guided the affairs of one hundred and twenty
   provinces; only he wanted Mordecai's knee: therefore he saith, all this
   avails me nothing. Ahab had the kingdom of Israel, and yet falls sick
   for want of Naboth's vineyard. In engines of war, if one peg be
   missing, or out of order, all stops. In the body of man, if one humour
   be out of order, or joint broken, it is enough to make us ill at ease,
   though all the rest be sound and whole; so if there be the least evil,
   a man cannot be a completely happy man. Well, then, from this blessed
   estate of the dead in the Lord, all evil is removed. Now evil is
   twofold--either of sin or punishment: in heaven there is neither.

   (1st.) To begin with sin, that is the worst evil; affliction is evil,
   but it is not evil in itself, but only in our sense and feeling; but
   sin is evil whether we feel it or no; it is worst when we feel it not.
   That is evil which separates from the chiefest good. Affliction doth
   not separate from God; it is a means and occasion to make us draw near
   to him. Many had never been acquainted with God but for their
   afflictions; but sin separates from God: Isa. lix. 2, Your iniquities
   have separated,' &c. Let a man be never so loathsome, yet if he be in a
   state of grace he is dear to God, the Lord takes pleasure in him;
   though he should be rough-cast with ulcers and sores, in a prison, yet
   God will kiss him with the kisses of his mouth: there is nothing loath
   some and odious to God but sin. This grieves the saints most: Rom. vii.
   23, O wretched man that I am,' &c. If any man had cause to complain of
   afflictions, Paul had; in perils often, in perils by land, in perils by
   sea, in perils by enemies, in perils by false brethren, whipped,
   imprisoned, stoned; but he doth not cry out, When shall I be delivered
   from these afflictions? but this body of death! Lust troubled him more
   than scourges, and his captivity to the law of sin more than chains and
   prisons. This is the disposition of the saints: they are weary of the
   world, because they are sinning here whilst others are glorifying God;
   not only that they are suffering here, whilst others are enjoying God.
   A beast will forsake the place where he hath neither meat nor rest;
   carnal men, when they are beaten out of the world, have a fancy to
   heaven as a place of retreat; but that which troubles godly men is
   their sin. Well, now, in heaven there is no sin, there is neither spot
   nor wrinkle upon the face of glorified saints, Eph. v. 27. They were
   once as black as you, but now Christ presents them to God as a proof of
   the cleansing virtue of his blood. There they are freed from all sin;
   here with much ado we mortify our lust, and yet nature will be ever
   recoiling; as the ivy in the wall, cut it never so much, it will be
   breaking out again. It is much here if the dominion of sin be taken
   away; there the being of it is abolished; the glorified saints
   displease God no more, and are freed from all the immediate and
   inseparable consequences of original sin, from distractions in duty.
   Here love is not perfect, and therefore the soul cannot be fixed in the
   contemplation of God, and that is the reason of wandering thoughts; but
   there the heart cleaves to him without straggling; from pride, which
   lasts as long as life, and therefore called pride of life,' 1 John ii.
   16. We cannot have a revelation now, but we grow proud of it: nor an
   influence of grace, but it lifts us up, 2 Cor. xii. 2. There is a worm
   in manna: but there, when we are most high, we are most humble.
   Christians, is not this a blessed hope, that tells you of a sinless
   state, of being like Christ for purity and holiness? 1 John iii. 2, We
   shall see him as he is, for we shall be like unto him.' What is it that
   you have struggled with and groaned under all your lives but sin? Now
   that is blotted out when the days of refreshing come; and as there is
   no sin, so there are no temptations. In paradise there was a tempter,
   but not in heaven; Satan was long since cast out thence, and the saints
   fill up the vacant rooms of the apostate angels. The world is a place
   of snares, a valley of temptations; it is the devil's circuit. Where
   did he walk to and fro but in the earth? But into heaven nothing enters
   that defiles, Rev. xxi. 27: no serpent can creep in there. Christians,
   lift up your heads; you will get rid of sin and displease God no more:
   here we cry, Lord, deliver us from evil;' and there our cries are heard
   at the full. Grace weakeneth sin, but glory abolisheth it, and old Adam
   is left in the grave never to rise more.

   (2dly.) The next evil is the evil of affliction. Whatever is painful
   and burdensome to nature is a fruit of the fall, a brand and mark of
   our rebellion against God; therefore affliction must be done away as
   well as sin if we be completely happy. As in hell there is an evil, an
   only evil; a cup of wrath unmixed, without the least temperament of
   mercy; so in heaven there is happiness, and only happiness, sorrow is
   done away as well as sin; it is said he will wipe all tears from their
   eyes. The afflictions of the soul are gone; there are no more doubtings
   of God's love, nor sense of his displeasure; here, though we are
   pardoned, and the wound be cured, yet the scars remain. As Absalom
   could not see the king's face when he was restored, in wise
   dispensation God sometimes hides his face from us; we need to be dieted
   and to taste the vinegar and the gall sometimes, as well as the honey
   and sweetness. The world is a middle place, standing between heaven and
   hell, and therefore hath something of both, a mixture of pleasures and
   sorrows, both good and evil are to be received from the hand of God;
   but there is fulness of joy for evermore, Ps. xvi. 11. Here we complain
   that the candle of the Lord doth not shine over us with a like
   brightness, but there our sun remains in an eternal high noon, without
   clouds and the shadows of this night. The afflictions of the body are
   done away; heaven is a happy air, where none are sick; there is no such
   thing there as gouts and agues, and the grinding pains of the stone.
   The body here is called a vile body, Phil. iii. 21, as it is the
   instrument of sin and the subject of diseases. We have the root of
   diseases in the soul, and the matter and fuel of diseases in the body,
   peccant humours and principles of corruption. As wood is eaten out with
   worms that breed within itself, so are there in our bodies principles
   of corruption that do at length destroy them; but there we are wholly
   incorruptible. Yea, because deformity in the body is a monument of
   God's displeasure, one of the inconveniences introduced by Adam's fall,
   it is done away. The bodies rise in due proportion; whatever was
   monstrous or misshapen in the first edition is corrected in the second.
   And for violence without, heaven is a quiet place. When there are
   tumults in the world, God is introduced, Ps. ii. 4, as sitting in the
   heavens; a quiet posture. There is nothing to discompose those blessed
   spirits. The company of wicked men is a burthen; Lot's righteous soul
   was vexed with it, 2 Peter ii. 7; but there they are bound hand and
   foot and cast into utter darkness; as when men will not be ruled, they
   are sent to prison. Here the children of God are subject to a number of
   infirmities, hunger, thirst, nakedness, cold, want; but there we have a
   rich inheritance, as well as a glorious, Eph. i. 18. The distinctions
   of poor and rich, as understood in the world, do not outlive time; we
   have enough of true riches, which is eternal glory, and the full
   fruition of God; labour ceaseth, though there be a continual exercise
   of grace. All things rest when they come to their proper place; so do
   those which die in the Lord. We still serve God, but without weariness;
   yea, we are freed from the necessities of nature, eating, drinking, and
   sleeping, to which the greatest potentates are subject; though they are
   exempted from hard bodily labour, they are not exempted from the
   necessities of nature. Meat is for the belly, and the belly for meats,
   but God shall destroy both it and them.' 1 Cor. vi. 12. The use of
   meats, and of the stomach, and of the belly is abolished. It is a piece
   of our misery that our life is patched up of so many creatures, as a
   torn garment is pieced and patched up with supplies from abroad. Here
   the sheep or the silkworm affords us clothing, the beasts of the earth
   and fish of the sea serve for food; and all to support a ruinous
   fabric, ever ready to drop about our ears. But then we are above meat,
   and drink, and apparel; nakedness will be no shame, for glory will
   serve instead of a robe, and it will be meat and drink enough to do our
   Father's will; the body will not be a clog to the soul, but a help.
   That mass of flesh we carry about us is but the prison of the soul,
   where it looks out by the windows of the senses; but then it is no
   longer the prison of the soul, but the temple. In short, all that I
   have said upon this branch is comprised in Rev. xxi. 4, And God will
   wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there is no more death, nor
   sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for former
   things are passed away.' There is quite another change; new
   dispensations; no distraction of business; our whole employment will be
   to think of God, and study God, but without weariness, satiety, or
   distraction.

   (2.) In blessedness there is a confluence of all good necessary to the
   happiness of the creature. Our blessedness is full for parts, full for
   the degrees and manner of enjoyment; and all this continues for ever,
   without fear of losing it. Our crown of glory is a garland that will
   never wither; it is an eternal state of actual delights; we are blessed
   in our bodies, blessed in our souls, blessed in our company. Man is
   zoon poli'tikon, a sociable creature; and therefore to his complete
   happiness it is necessary that he should not be only blest in his
   person, but in his company and relations. We are brought into the
   presence of God, who is blessedness itself, and to the sight and
   blessed fellowship of his blessed Son, and into the company of blessed
   angels and saints.

   First, Let me speak of the happiness of his person, and then both of
   his body and soul.

   1st, For his body, it is now a temple of the Holy Ghost. He cannot
   leave his mansion and ancient dwelling-place, and therefore he raiseth
   it up and formeth it again into a complete fashion, like Christ's
   glorious body, Phil. iii. 21, for clarity, agility, strength,
   incorruption. Solomon's temple, when it was destroyed, the latter house
   was nothing so glorious as the former; men wept when they saw it, Ezra
   iii. 12. But it is not so here; it is raised quite another body. For
   the present there is to be seen a beautiful fabric wherein God hath
   shown his workmanship; every member, if it were not so common, would be
   a miracle; all is ordered for the service and comeliness of the whole.
   But now it is a vile body, subject to diseases, fed with meat, humbled
   with wants, many times mangled with violence, dissolved by death, and
   crumbled to dust in the grave like a dry clod of earth. This is the
   body we carry about us, a mass of flesh dressed up to be a dish for the
   worms. But this vile body shall rise in another manner, like Christ's
   glorious body. When the sun appears the stars vanish, their lustre is
   eclipsed and darkened; but the Sun of righteousness, when he appears at
   the last day, doth not obscure, but perfect our glory. More
   particularly; if you inquire wherein our bodies shall be like Christ's
   glorious body, the apostle will tell us that in another place, 1 Cor.
   xv. 40-44. Let me single out three expressions: it is raised in
   incorruption; it is raised in glory; it is raised a spiritual body.
   (1.) It is an incorruptible body. Now it yields to the decays of
   nature, and is exercised with pains and aches, till at length it
   droppeth down like ripe fruit into the grave; but here after it shall
   be clothed with immortality, wholly impassible. What a comfort is this
   to those that are racked with the stone or gout, broken with diseases,
   or withered with age, to think that they shall have a body without
   aches, and without decays, that shall always be in the spring of youth!
   The trees of paradise are always green. (2.) It shall be a glorious
   body. Here it is many times deformed; at least, beauty, like a flower,
   is lost in sickness, davered or withered with age, defaced by several
   accidents; but then we shall be glorious like to Christ's body. The
   naked body of man was so beautiful in innocency that the beasts of the
   field admired it, and thereupon did homage to Adam; but we shall not be
   conformed to the first Adam, but the second. Christ in, the mount, when
   he was transfigured, they could not endure the shining of his garments,
   it astonished the disciples, Mat. xvii.; his garments could not veil,
   nor their eyes endure, those strong emissions of the beams of glory.
   Paul could not endure the light that shined to him when Christ appeared
   to him from heaven, Acts ix., but was utterly confounded and struck
   blind. By this you may guess a little at the glory of the body when it
   is likened to Christ's glorious body. Moses, by conversing with God
   forty days, the complexion of his face was altered so that they were
   glad to put a veil upon it. In this low estate in which we are, we must
   make use of these hints. (3.) A spiritual body, either for agility. We
   shall not be clogged as now; we shall be caught up in the air to meet
   the Lord. Or rather a spiritual body, because more disposed for
   spiritual uses, for the enjoyments and the employments of grace. Here
   it is a natural body, an unready instrument for the soul: we are not in
   a capacity to bear the new wine of glory; but there we are made more
   capacious and stronger vessels to contain all that God will give out.
   The disciples fainted at Christ's transfiguration, Mat. xvii. 6. We
   cannot receive such large diffusions and overflowings of glory as we
   shall then have; every strong affection and raised thought doth overset
   us, and cause ecstasy and ravishment; but there it is otherwise: God
   maketh out himself to us in a greater latitude, and we are more able to
   bear it.

   2dly, For the blessedness of the soul, which is the heaven of heaven.
   Our happiness is called The inheritance of the saints in light.' Col.
   i. 12, for which we must be prepared. It is not for them that know no
   other heaven but to eat, drink, and sleep, and wallow in filthy and
   gross pleasures; it is an inheritance in light, and for saints that
   know how to value intellectual and spiritual delights. Wherein, you
   will say, lies the happiness of the soul? in knowledge or love? Ans.
   Divines are divided; certainly in both. Our happiness consists in the
   love of God, and knowledge of God, from whence results union with God,
   and fruition of God. It is hard to say which is to be preferred, to
   know God, or love God. In one place the scripture tells us, this is
   life eternal, to know the only true God,' John xvii. 3; so that it
   seems to be the heaven of heaven to have the understanding satisfied
   with the knowledge of God: Ps. xvii. 15, When I awake I shall be
   satisfied with thine image and likeness.' On the other side: 1 John iv.
   16, He that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.' The embrace
   of the soul is by love, the possession of God is by acts of love. One
   saith (it may be not modestly enough), Libentius sine aspectu, et te
   diligerem, quam te videndo non amarem [32] --that he had rather not see
   God than not love him. Here in the world the hatred of God is worse
   than ignorance of him; and therefore, it should seem, love should have
   the pre-eminence. But we need not make a faction between the graces; by
   knowing we come to love, and by loving we come to know. As light is, so
   is love, and so is enjoyment. Here we love little because we know
   little: If thou knewest the gift,' &c., John iv. 10; and the more we
   love, the more we know. This is a fire that casts light. But to speak
   more distinctly:--

   (1.) There is the perfection of knowledge. All the faculties must be
   satisfied before we can be happy; especially so noble a faculty as the
   mind is. There is a natural inclination to knowledge; the soul takes a
   great deal of contentment in the contemplation of any truth. The
   knowledge of wisdom to thy soul (saith Solomon) shall be as the
   honeycomb when thou hast found it, Prov. xxiv. 13, 14; Eight and clear
   thoughts of God breed a rejoicing, Ps. xix. 10. Well, then, this is no
   small part of our happiness, to have more light and knowledge of God
   and of his ways. We shall know many mysteries of salvation that we are
   now ignorant of; as the nature of God: Ps. xvii. 15, I shall be
   satisfied with thy image and likeness;' the union of the two natures in
   the person of Christ: John xvii. 24, They shall behold my glory;' our
   union with Christ and by Christ with God: John xiv. 20, In that day
   they shall know that I am in the Father,' &c.; the course of God's
   decrees and providences for our good: 1 Cor. xiii. 12, We shall know as
   we are known;' that is, we shall be able to see how the unchangeable
   counsels of God for our salvation have been carried on through all the
   passages of the present life, to bring us safe to the heavenly state.
   These are the deeps of God, and now there is darkness upon the face of
   these deeps. The church is but a grammar-school; heaven is the
   university. We shall have other eyes, and other light. Prophecy is but
   in part now, our intuition shall be then immediate: 1 John iii. 2, We
   shall see him as he is;' now we see him not as he is, but as he is
   pleased to reveal himself; now we see what he is not--not corruptible,
   not mortal, not changeable--rather than what he is. Now we see him as
   he is in us, and as he is in other creatures. We track him by the
   effects of his power and wisdom and goodness; but then we shall see him
   as he is in himself, we shall see him face to face, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. In
   the creatures there is vestigium, the track and footprint of God; in
   the law there is umbra, a shadow; in the gospel, imago, an image, a
   fair draught of God as in a picture; but in heaven, face to face. We
   have excellent books to study the large manifestations of his glory,
   the majesty of Christ's person; we shall always sit about the throne,
   and behold God in the face of the Lamb; there God makes out himself in
   the highest manifestation that we are capable of.

   (2.) Complete love. There is a constant cleaving of heart to God,
   without change and weariness; a love that never ceaseth working, and
   yet God in communion is ever new and fresh to us. If we delight in
   anything here, we soon grow weary and have a change of objects. Here
   are distractions and startings aside to the creature; but there is an
   eternal solace and complacency in God, a continual sabbath that never
   grows burdensome; all the heart and bowels run out after Christ; we
   never want the actual breathings of the Spirit. The Spirit came upon
   Samson at times; so it doth upon us here. Motions are fleeting and
   vanishing; but there Christ is a more lovely object, and the delights
   of the soul are carried out to him without any satiety. They are
   outward things that cloy the appetite; as soon as we have them we
   despise them; we sip, as the bee doth of the flower, and then goeth to
   a new flower. But there is an eternal complacency in Christ. Here we
   are troubled when we want outward comforts, and cloyed when we have
   them; because curiosity is soon satisfied, and fruition discovers the
   imperfections of the creature, so that the more enjoyed they are, the
   less beloved; as Amnon hated Tamar, &c. Imperfections that before lay
   hid, are then laid open to view, and so our affections are confuted by
   experience. But there the more we enjoy God, the more his infinite
   perfections are manifested, and the pleasure is augmented by enjoyment.

   (3.) Complete union with God and fruition of God: see 2 Cor. v. 6,
   Phil. i. 23. Here we are united by faith; but that is nothing to sight
   and immediate tuition. We lay hold upon Christ, but have not such an
   absolute possession of him; he is a head that gives out himself not by
   necessity, but choice and pleasure; therefore our communion with him is
   not so high and sweet as then. The iron that lieth long in the fire
   seems to be changed into the nature of it; we are, then, more conformed
   and changed into the likeness of Christ. All the comforts that we have
   in this life, we enjoy in God's absence, and by the ministry of the
   creatures. Now, the creatures are not vessels capacious enough to
   convey so much of God to us as we shall receive when he is all in all
   immediately, 1 Cor. xv. 24. There is no temple nor ordinances, but God
   is instead of all, without means or the intervention of such supplies.
   We feed among the lilies, but it is but till the day break, and the
   shadows fly away.

   3dly, In our company we must be blessed. There is God, and Christ, and
   saints, and angels, Heb. xii. 26. We shall see God in Christ. The
   bodily eye, that cannot look upon the sun, shall be perfectly
   sanctified, glorified; though it cannot see the essence of God, yet it
   shall see greater manifestations of glory. How will the Father welcome
   us as he welcomed Christ? Ps. ii. 8, Ask of me and I will give thee,'
   &c. So Well done, good and faithful servant.' We shall not come into
   his presence with shame; sin causeth shame, and maketh us shy of God.
   As the eye cannot endure the light if it be wronged, so wronged
   conscience makes us afraid of the presence of God. But when sin is done
   away, we shall have boldness in that day. As we shall have the company
   of God, so of Christ: he cannot be contented with out your company; you
   should not be satisfied without his: John xiv. 3, I will come again and
   receive you to myself, that where I am you may be also.' Oh! what a
   joyful meeting will it be between us and our Redeemer, much sweeter
   than the interview between Jacob and Joseph. Christ longs for the
   blessed hour as much as you do. The wise men came from far to see him
   in a manger; Zaccheus climbed up into a tree to see him in the days of
   his flesh. He is another manner of Christ in heaven than he was in the
   days of his abasement. When Joseph discovered himself to his brethren,
   I am Joseph,' it revived their hearts. When Christ shall say, I am
   Jesus, your brother, your Saviour, your Redeemer; when he shall lead us
   to God in a full troop and goodly company, and say, Behold I and the
   little ones which thou hast given me,' Heb. ii. 13, what a blessed
   sight will that be! Then the angels, what welcome will there be between
   you and them! When Christ entered into heaven, Ps. xxiv., they
   entertained him with applauses and acclamations: Stand open, you doors,
   stand open; here is the King of glory, the Lord strong and mighty in
   battle.' So will they welcome the saints to heaven with acclamations.
   They delight in the good of men. When man was created, The morning
   stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy,' Job.
   xxxviii. 7; that is, the angels rejoiced and praised God. When Christ
   came to redeem man, a heavenly host fell a-praising God, Luke ii. 13,
   14. When man is converted, the scripture tells there is joy in heaven,'
   Luke xv. 7. So when we come to be glorified, Christ shall come with
   troops of them to conduct us into those everlasting mansions. The
   saints, your acquaintance, with whom you prayed, suffered, familiarly
   conversed--memory is not abolished in heaven, but perfected--those whom
   we knew here, we shall know again. A minister shall see his crown, and
   the fruit of his labours: 1 Thes. ii. 19, You are our crown,' &c. And
   those that have been relieved by us shall welcome us into heaven, who,
   therefore, are said to receive us into everlasting habitations, Luke
   xvi. 9; yea, we shall know those whom we never saw; why else is it made
   a part of our privilege to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob?
   Mat. viii. 11. As Adam knew Eve, and, in the transfiguration, Peter
   knew Moses and Elias, dead many hundred years before, so shall we know
   one another. We shall not go to a strange people, where we know nobody.
   As men at a feast are social and familiar one with another, we shall be
   discoursing of God's wisdom, mercy, justice, in the work of
   redemption--so did Moses and Elias with Christ, Luke ix. 31--of the
   wonderful providence of God in conducting us to glory, as travellers in
   their inn take pleasure to discourse with one another of the dirtiness
   and dangers of the way. And these saints are clothed with majesty and
   glory, more lovely objects than ever they were upon earth; and there is
   an innumerable company of them. They were rapt for joy when they saw
   but two prophets, Moses and Elias, Mat. xvii. 4. But heaven is not only
   called a palace, but a city, a world to come. There is a multitude
   which none can number.

   3. Whence it is that they who die in the Lord are sure to be thus
   blessed.

   [1.] From their union with Christ.

   [2.] From the covenant of God with them.

   [1.] From their union with Christ, which can never be dissolved. Death
   severeth body and soul, but not Christ and the soul. From this union
   there result two things--conformity with Christ in every estate, and
   the communion of the Spirit; both which do imply the blessedness of the
   saints even after death. They that are united with Christ do share with
   him in every estate, in grace here and in glory hereafter. As to both,
   they are predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, Rom.
   viii. 29. And where the Spirit once dwelleth, there he dwelleth for
   ever; and therefore, from the indwelling of the Spirit of holiness doth
   the apostle infer our resurrection to a glorious estate, Rom. viii. 11.
   And that losing nothing which Christ speaketh of, John vi. 39, I would
   interpret of his not losing one member or joint of his mystical body.

   [2.] From the covenant of God with them. Christ proves the resurrection
   from God's being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Mat. xxii. 32.
   The argument stands upon three feet:--(1.) To be a God to any is to be
   a benefactor; for the tenor of the covenant on God's part is, I will be
   thy God, as on our part, you shall be my people; (2.) That God would be
   an everlasting benefactor; it implies an external [33] communication of
   grace and glory, as Christ proves from, Exod. iii. 6, that God assumed
   this title after their death; (3.) This covenant was made with the
   whole man, not only with the soul but the body, and therefore they bore
   the mark and the sign of it, which was circumcision, in their bodies.
   And in Heb. xi. 16, the apostle saith that because God had a heavenly
   inheritance to bestow upon the patriarchs, therefore he was not ashamed
   to be called their God, implying that if they had no other reward than
   what they enjoyed in the present life, God could not with honour (such
   was the slenderness and contemptibleness of their present condition)
   have owned such a glorious title and appellation as to be called the
   God of Abraham. What needs further arguing? the phrase itself imports
   what we assert. When God promiseth to be a God to any, he maketh over
   his whole self, his eternity and infiniteness, for their comfort and
   use; and so in effect saith that he will be an everlasting benefactor
   to their whole persons in the way of an infinite power.

   Let us now apply all.

   1. Because this privilege is expressed with a limitation, it informeth
   us that the wicked are excluded; they must expect a quite contrary
   estate; as they that die in the Lord are in a blessed, so all others in
   a cursed condition. It is a sweet close when the body and soul part,
   but God and the soul meet; when conscience shall become our
   compurgator, and bear us witness that we have spent our time well, in
   fearing God and obeying God; then may the body and soul take leave of
   one another with an expectation to meet again in glory. But it is a sad
   parting when conscience falls a-raving, and the body and the soul
   accuse one another. The body accuseth the soul as an ill guide, and the
   soul the body as an unready instrument. And at the day of their death,
   which is the time of separation, they curse the day of their birth,
   which was the time of the first union between them both, when they
   shall wish that they had been stifled in the womb, and had never seen
   the light, rather than to have lived together in such a fashion, and to
   part in such manner. Now, this many times is the case of wicked men at
   their death; death cometh to them as a double evil; as a natural evil,
   striking the body and dissolving the confederacy and union between it
   and the soul; and as a penal evil, or the curse of the first covenant,
   wounding the conscience, and reviving their bondage and fears of a
   worse judgment to ensue. And then, though physicians and ministers be
   sent for, they may both prove of no value, either to prevent the
   dissolution or to give ease to the conscience.

   2. It presseth us to provide for this hour, that when we come to die we
   may die in the Lord. Get an interest in Christ, that you may die in the
   Lord as to your estate. Security will not hold out when you launch into
   the other world; a wicked man comes to himself when he comes to die; at
   his latter end he shall be a fool, Jer. xvii. 11. He was ever a fool,
   but then he shall be one in the conviction and acknowledgment of his
   own conscience, his own heart will make him cry out, fool, madman that
   I was, to be contented with such slight evidences for eternity! You
   see, then, it is good to be upon sure terms, and to get our union with
   Christ so clear and sensible, that when we walk in the valley of the
   shadow of death we may not be afraid, Ps. xxiii. As to the frame of
   your hearts, it is a harder matter to die well than you are aware of.
   If you would die well, live well, otherwise you do but provide matter
   of despair and sorrow for your latter end. It is every one's wish, Oh,
   that I might die the death of the righteous! Num. xxiii.; but it is not
   every one's happiness.

   If you would die in the Lord, you had need to have promises ready, and
   your faith well exercised, that you may have good proof of it before it
   comes to stead you in death. In bello non licet bis peccare. As in war,
   so in death; there is no erring twice; then you are to throw your last
   cast for everlasting woe or weal, to do that which you never did
   before: you had need of armour of proof to deal with the last enemy.
   How foolishly do they deal that defer all to this hour, and are then to
   get faith when they should reduce it into practice; faith is a grace
   wrought by degrees to strength and perfection. Now to put it to the
   hardest trial at first is absurd and irrational. You should have your
   evidences clear, your promises ready, your experiences at hand, that
   you may be able to comfort yourselves and to plead for God, and to
   speak to the standers-by of the long proof you have had of his being a
   good Master and a gracious Father to you. How is it, then? Are all
   things set at rights between God and your souls? Have you laid up
   comforts for this great day of expense? Is your dying speech ready? Are
   you provided of experiences whereby to commend the mercifulness and
   faithfulness of your Redeemer? Can you say that you have tried him
   often, and he never failed you all your days? If it be so indeed, your
   great work is done.

   3. Use. To encourage the children of God to be more willing to die. Are
   you afraid to enter upon your own blessedness and glory? Will you shun
   Christ's company when he desires yours? Love brought Christ out of
   heaven that he might be with us; he thought of it before the world was,
   Prov. viii. 31, and longed for the time, in effect saying, When will it
   come? We are to go from earth to heaven, from conversing with men to
   converse with angels, and why so loth to remove? What could Christ
   expect upon his coming into the world but hard usage? but labour, and
   griefs, and shame, and death? He came to taste the vinegar and the
   gall; we are called to the feast of love, to taste of hidden manna, and
   the rivers of pleasure that flow in his presence. If you love Christ,
   why should you be unwilling to be in the arms of Christ?--to be there
   where he is, beholding his glory. Love is an affection of union, it
   desireth to be with the party loved; and can you be unwilling to be
   dissolved and be with Christ? Death is the chariot that is to carry you
   into his presence. Jacob's spirit revived when he saw the waggons which
   Joseph sent to carry him into Egypt, Gen. xlv. 27. What is there in the
   world to be compared with heaven? Either there must be something in the
   world to detain us, or we are frightened at the terribleness of the
   passage, or else there is a contempt of what is to come. You cannot say
   anything in the world is more worthy than Christ; in this sense you
   renounced father and mother, brothers and sisters, wife and children
   and friends, when you were first acquainted with him. It was the
   language of your souls then, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there
   is none on earth that I desire besides thee,' Ps. lxxiii. 25. Did you
   dissemble then? or have you found cause since to retreat and begrudge
   your affections to him? Christ puts you to the trial when sickness
   comes; he hath sent his waggons to see if you will stand to your word.
   Is it the terribleness of the passage? Doth nature grudge at the
   thought of a dissolution? Where is your faith? Death is yours, 1 Cor.
   iii. 18, your friend, your advantage; Christ hath assured you of it.
   Will you trust his word? You love him little when you have no
   confidence in what he saith. Or is it contempt of things to come? Then
   why is all this cost? why came Christ to lay down his soul to purchase
   that which you care not for? what needs all this waste? Christians here
   for the time to come, we know not how soon we may be sent for and put
   to the trial. It is good to be resolved, that we may say the sooner the
   better.

   4. Let this comfort us concerning our friends that die in the Lord: 1
   Thes. iv. 18, Comfort one another with these words.' This is proper,
   Christian, scripture comfort. Heathens, to comfort one another, can
   only say that death is the common passage out of this world, that all
   that are born must die. But Christians can comfort one another upon
   better terms, that they that sleep in Jesus are blessed; and shall we
   whine at their preferment? that we shall all meet again in the other
   world; that a day will come when the Captain of our salvation will have
   his great rendezvous, and the head of the church call all the saints
   into one congregation, Ps. i. 5; and the whole flock shall follow the
   great Shepherd of the sheep into their everlasting fold, triumphing and
   saying, O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'
   These are comforts proper for Christians; especially for ministers,
   that are messengers of comfort to others, that have more frequent
   advantages of meditation upon those privileges than others have. Shall
   we murmur and yield to sinkings of heart when God hath made a breach
   upon our relations? How will this disparage our doctrine, and make
   others suspect the comforts which we reach forth to them upon like
   occasions? Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
   strengthened the feeble knees; but now it is come upon thee and thou
   faintest; it toucheth thee and thou art troubled,' Job iv. 4, 5.

   To comfort others and faint ourselves is to bring a discredit upon what
   we propound to them. Remember the glory of God is concerned in your
   behaviour under this trial, and the honour of your ministry. Let your
   Christian friends know there is a reality in what you have held forth
   for their support in like case. Let them see you make it your care to
   practise your own doctrine. We are set forth for signs. God's eyes and
   men's are upon us; do worthily and becoming your station.

   It is true, God comes near when he separates those that are so near and
   dear one to another, and we ought to lay it to heart; but that wherein
   you are like to err is in too much sorrow and dejection of spirit;
   which may be your wisdom to labour to prevent, as being seemly for a
   Christian and a preacher to show his moderation. We find that Abraham
   mourned for Sarah; and he had great cause so to do, for she was a very
   good companion to him in all his travels and troubles; she was very
   pleasing in his eye in regard of her beauty; she brought him a child in
   his old age, the son of the promise; she is honoured in scripture above
   all other women of her age; the time how long she lived is set down,
   which is not done for any other woman. At her death Abraham mourns, but
   very moderately; he wept for her, but we find no excess in the measure
   or in the time of his grief; and he is a good pattern. David weeps for
   the death of his child while it was alive, for he feared it would die;
   and the thing he feared came upon him: but when they thought that upon
   the death of his child his tears would have risen to a flood, it was
   suddenly a low ebb; and he gives herein instruction to all mourners,
   and to you, teaching you to say, Wherefore should I now fast and weep
   any longer? I cannot bring her back again: I shall go to her, but she
   not shall return to me;' and plainly asserts that none should mourn
   more than they can give a good reason for: Why should I now mourn?' You
   know it is no other than we ought daily to expect and look for here
   below,--vicissitudes, namely, and changes. And you will soon meet her
   again in heaven, where (as I conceive with Austin) she shall be
   notissima tibi. And in the meantime, in your enjoying Christ you enjoy
   her still in him. And all the helps, advantages, sweetnesses, counsels,
   consolations, satisfactions, defences, carings, cordials, contentments,
   whatever was lovely in her, whatever you loved her for, you still enjoy
   in him, either by the administration of other mediums, or immediately
   from himself; and what comes from God immediately is much sweeter. You
   have cause rather to be thankful you enjoyed her so long, than
   sorrowful you can on earth enjoy her no longer. I know not whether her
   religion, worth, and holiness, will serve more to aggravate your loss,
   or to allay your sorrow. It is sad to think you have lost such a
   loving, humble, godly, and meet companion. But remember, that because
   she was such an one, you have the more confidence that she is blessed,
   and is gone from you to better company, even to the company of saints
   free from all sin and all sorrow, full of holiness and happiness; of
   angels too; of Jesus Christ too, the King of saints, the Lord of
   angels; he that so loved us; he that did so much, suffered so much for
   us; he whom the fathers before his incarnation so longed to see; he
   whom every believing soul so pants and breathes after. Which that it
   may the more sensibly appear, I shall here take occasion to subjoin her
   just and true character.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE CHARACTER OF MRS JANE BLACKWELL.

   SHE was a gentlewoman born, of the house of the Wintringhams, a family
   of eminency and note in Yorkshire. Educated and trained up from her
   childhood, till married, under Dr Chaderton, Master of Emmanuel College
   in Cambridge, that famous godly man, and her near kinsman; by reason
   whereof she was, even in her younger years, so grounded in knowledge,
   seasoned with grace, and accomplished with abiliments and endowments
   every way, that she was a most rare and incomparable companion for a
   minister.

   Some things there were wherein she was exceeding exemplary. As she was
   a woman of a marvellously humble spirit; that all who knew her and
   conversed with her, admired in her; and it was abundantly evident and
   apparent in her countenance, speeches, gestures, apparel, and every
   way.

   A simple, single, plain-hearted woman; An Israelite indeed, in whom
   there was no guile.'

   A merciful, pitiful, charitable woman. Open-hearted, open-handed too,
   to her power, yea, and beyond her power--spared it from her own back
   and belly to clothe and feed others--gladly embraced occasions when
   offered, yea, greedily sought out occasions. Her love was not verbal
   only, such as that James speaks of, Go and be clothed, go and be
   warmed,' &c., but real. She refreshed the bowels of many. The blessing
   of him that was ready to perish came upon her, and she made the widow's
   heart to sing for joy. When the Scots were shut up and starved by
   thousands at Westminster, she very frequently visited them, and
   ministered to them; yea, bought divers of them with her own money,
   gracious good men, whom she fed and clothed, and disposed of into
   families and ways wherein they live to this day very comfort ably. When
   the Scotch ministers and others were under restraint in the Tower, she
   was not ashamed of their chain, but diligently sought them out as soon
   as she heard of them, and was all the time of their long confinement a
   great support and comfort to them. She had not only learned the
   heathen's lesson to lay up, but the Christian's lesson too, to lay out
   according as the necessities of the poor members of Jesus Christ called
   for it.

   A true mourner, one that laid to heart, and was affected, deeply
   affected, with the sins and abominations of the times, with the
   miseries likewise and distresses of the church and people of God--made
   the church's sorrows her own sorrows--had bowels of compassion in her
   to lament and mourn over the afflicted condition of the church, as if
   it were her own condition--remembered them in bonds, as bound with
   them, and them that suffered adversity, as being her self also in the
   body. The heart-breaking miseries of poor Scotland broke her heart. She
   could not speak of them without many tears.

   A fixed, established, grounded Christian; not like those the apostle
   speaks of, Eph. iv. 14, that were kludonizomenoi kai peripheromenoi,
   like clouds in the air, or like ships on the sea, tossed and hurried up
   and down with every wind and wave, driven to and fro, this way and that
   way, but like a house built upon a rock, like a tree firmly rooted, a
   fixed star; no wandering star (wandering from one opinion to another,
   and from one way to another, but a fixed star) , kept to her old
   principles and to her old practices, the good old way, the way the
   patriarchs and the prophets, and the apostles and the holy men and
   women in the old time (1 Peter iii. 5) went to heaven in--the way of
   sanctifying God's sabbaths, the way of frequenting public ordinances,
   the way of performing family and closet duties, the way of reading the
   scriptures, meditation, self-examination, &c. And for the sacrament of
   the Lord's Supper, she received it constantly, as oft as it was
   administered in the congregation whereof she was--never missed once.

   One that filled up her relations to the very utmost that it is almost
   possible to do. One that did abound in love to God, to his ways,
   ordinances, truths, people. Hereby shall all men know that you are my
   disciples, if you love one another,' says Christ; and this evidence she
   had in visible characters. Wherever she saw aliquod Christi, as Luther
   speaks, there her love was fixed; were it in rags or robes, poor or
   rich, all one for that. All that were dear to God were dear to her
   soul.

   No wanderer from house to house, and idle squanderer away of her
   precious time in complimental visits. Had learned to keep at home; and
   that is the duty, the wisdom, the honour too of a woman. Sarah was
   found in her tent still, and Jael in her tent.

   This I mention because she was much blamed by many for not going to
   christenings and burials, &c., as if she did it out of pride and
   self-conceitedness, and contempt and disdain of others, or out of a
   sullen retiredness and affected privacy; whereas she did it out of mere
   conscientiousness of her duty. And she had many reasons why she did it;
   as, partly, because her eldest daughter dying in childbed, she and her
   child both, about eight years since, she found that such meetings
   renewed upon her afresh the remembrance of that very great loss; partly
   because she saw so much gallantry and bravery in apparel, &c., at such
   meetings, as did not a little trouble her; but especially be cause she
   saw it to be so much a waster of much precious time, which she knew how
   to make a better improvement of.

   What shall I say? In a word, she was a pattern of mortification, of
   self-denial, of contempt of the world, of strictness and holiness, and
   close walking with God, both in her general and particular calling, to
   all that were about her while she lived.

   And in the time of her sickness, so patient, so contented, so willing
   to be at God's dispose, either for life or death, so fearful lest there
   should be so much as in her heart any the least risings against God's
   dispensations, so full of sweet, holy, heavenly instructions,
   exhortations, counsels to her husband, to her children, to her friends.
   Her lips were like a well of life, feeding many, as Solomon speaks,
   dropping like a honeycomb.

   I might enlarge; but shall conclude all with that of our Saviour (John
   xiv. 28), when his disciples sat blubbering and weeping and taking on.
   because he had told them he must now leave them in regard of his bodily
   presence, and go to heaven, go to his Father: If you loved me,' saith
   he, if you loved me, you would rejoice, because I go to the Father.'
   Oh, how well it were if you could do so! And do it. You say you loved
   her, show it; and show it in this way--show it in rejoicing rather than
   in mourning--in rejoicing in her gain, rather than in mourning in your
   own loss. It is true the loss is great. The family, the city, the
   nation, the whole world, indeed, has a loss. Good men and good women,
   such as have an interest in God, and a heart to improve that interest,
   as they are a public good whilst they live, so their loss is a public
   loss when they die; and in that respect you have cause to mourn. But
   otherwise, in regard of her, no cause at all, but rather to rejoice.
   For why? Though she is dead, she is dead in the Lord. And this blessed
   condition we have been speaking of all this while, it is undoubtedly
   her condition.
