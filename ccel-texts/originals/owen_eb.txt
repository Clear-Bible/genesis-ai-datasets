                             Biography of John Owen

   Owen, John (1616-1683), theologian, was born of Puritan parents at
   Stadham in Oxfordshire in 1616. At twelve years of age he was admitted
   at Queen's College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1632 and
   M.A. in 1635. During these years he worked with such diligence that he
   allowed himself but four hours sleep a night, and damaged his health by
   this excessive labour. In 1637 he was driven from Oxford by his refusal
   to comply with the requirements of Laud's new statutes. Having taken
   orders shortly before, he became chaplain and tutor in the family of
   Sir Robert Dormer of Ascot in Oxfordshire. At the outbreak of the civil
   troubles he adopted Parliamentary principles, and thus lost both his
   place and the prospects of succeeding to his uncle's fortune. For a
   while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, in great unsettlement of mind on
   religious questions, which was removed at length by a sermon which he
   accidently heard at St Michael's in Wood Street.

   His first publication, in 1642, A Display of Arminianism, dedicated to
   the committee of religion gained him the living of Fordham in Essex,
   from which a "scandalous minister" had been ejected. Here he was
   married, and by his marriage he had eleven children.

   Although he was thus formally united to Presbyterianism, Owen's views
   were originally inclined to those of the Independents, and, as he
   acquainted himself more fully with the controversy, he became more
   resolved in that direction. He represented, in fact, that large class
   of persons who, falling away from Episcopacy, attached themselves to
   the very moderate form of Presbyterianism which obtained in England as
   being that which came first in their way. His views at this time are
   shown by his Duty of Pastors and People Distinguished. At Fordham he
   remained until 1646, when, the old incumbent dying, the presentation
   lapsed to the patron, who gave it to some one else. He was now,
   however, coming into notice, for on April 29 he preached before the
   Parliament. In this sermon, and still more in his Thoughts on Church
   Government, which he appended to it, his tendency to break away from
   Presbyterianism is displayed.

   The people of Coggeshall in Essex now invited him to become their
   pastor. Here he declared his change by founding a church on
   Congregational principles, and, in 1647, by publishing Eshcol, as well
   as various works against Arminianism. He made the friendship of Fairfax
   while the latter was besieging Colchester, and urgently addressed the
   army there against religious persecution. He was chosen to preach to
   Parliament on the day after the execution of Charles, and succeeded in
   fulfilling his task without mentioning that event, and again on April
   19, when he spake thus:--"The time shall come when the earth shall
   disclose her slain, and not the simplest heretic shall have his blood
   unrevenged; neither shall any atonement or expiation be allowed for
   this blood, while a toe of the image, or a bone of the beast, is left
   unbroken."

   He now became acquainted with Cromwell, who carried him off to Ireland
   in 1649 as his chaplain, that he might regulate the affairs of Trinity
   College; while there he began the first of his frequent controversies
   with Baxter by writing against the latter's Aphorisms of Justification.
   In 1650 he accompanied Cromwell to Scotland, and returned to Coggeshall
   in 1651. In March Cromwell, as chancellor, gave him the deanery of
   Christ Church, and made him vice-chancellor in September 1652. In 1651,
   October 24, after Worcester, he preached the thanksgiving sermon before
   Parliament. In October 1653 he was one of several ministers whom
   Cromwell, probably to sound their views, summoned to a consultation as
   to church union. In December in the same year he had the honour of D.D.
   conferred upon him by his university. In the Parliament of 1664 he sat,
   but only for a short time, as member for Oxford university, and, with
   Baxter, was placed on the committee for settling the "fundamentals"
   necessary for the toleration promised in the Instrument of Government.
   He was, too, one of the Triers, and appears to have behaved with
   kindness and moderation in that capacity. As vice-chancellor he acted
   with readiness and spirit when a general rising in the west seemed
   imminent in 1655; his adherence to Cromwell, however was by no means
   slavish, for he drew up, at the request of Desborough and Pride, a
   petition against his receiving the kingship (see Ludlow's Memoirs, ed.
   1751, p. 224). During the years 1654-58 his chief controversial works
   were De Divina Justitia, The Perseverance of Saints (against Goodwin)
   and Vindiciæ Evangelicæ (against the Socinians). In 1658 he took a
   leading part in the conference which drew up the Savoy Declaration.

   Baxter declares that at the death of Cromwell Owen joined the
   Wallingford House party. This, though supported by the fact that under
   the Restoration he had among his congregation a large number of these
   officers, Owen himself utterly denied. He appears, however, to have
   assisted in the restoration of the Rump Parliament, and, when Monk
   began his march into England, Owen, in the name of the Independent
   churches, to whom Monk was supposed to belong, and who were keenly
   anxious as to his intentions, wrote to dissuade him from the
   enterprise.

   In March 1660, the Presbyterian party being uppermost, Owen was
   deprived of his deanery, which was given back to Reynolds. He retired
   to Stadham, where he wrote various controversial and theological works,
   in especial the laborious Theologoumena Pantodapa, a history of the
   rise and progress of theology. In 1661 was published the celebrated
   Fiat Lux, a work in which the oneness and beauty of Roman Catholicism
   are contrasted with the confusion and multiplicity of Protestant sects.
   At Clarendon's request Owen answered this in 1662 in his
   Animadversions; and this led of course to a prolonged controversy.
   Clarendon now offered Owen perferment if he would conform. Owen's
   condition for making terms was liberty to all who agree in doctrine
   with the Church of England; nothing therefore came of the negotiation.

   In 1663 he was invited by the Congregational churches in Boston, New
   England, to become their minister, but declined. The Conventicle and
   Five Mile Acts soon drove him to London; and in 1666, after the Fire,
   he, as did other leading Nonconformist ministers, fitted up a room for
   public service and gathered a congregation, composed chiefly of the old
   Commonwealth officers. Meanwhile he was incessantly writing; and in
   1667 he published his Catechism, which led to a proposal from Baxter
   for union. Various papers passed, and after a year the attempt was
   closed by the following laconical note from Owen: " I am still a
   well-wisher to these mathematics." It was now, too, that he published
   the first part of his vast work upon the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   In 1669 Owen wrote a spirited remonstrance to the Congregationalists in
   New England, who, under the influence of Presbyterianism, had shown
   themselves persecutors. At home, too, he was busy in the same cause. In
   1670 Parker attacked the Nonconformists in his own style of clumsy
   intolerance. Owen answered him; Parker repeated his attack; Marvell
   wrote The Rehearsal Transprosed; and Parker is remembered by this
   alone.

   At the revival of the Conventicle Acts in 1670, Owen was appointed to
   draw up a paper of reasons which was submitted to the House of Lords in
   protest. In this or the following year Harvard university invited him
   to become their president; he received similar invitations from some of
   the Dutch universities.

   When Charles issued his Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, Owen drew up
   an address of thanks. This indulgence gave the dissenters an
   opportunity for increasing their churches and services, and Owen was
   one of the first preachers at the weekly lectures which the
   Independents and Presbyterians jointly held in Plummer's Hall. He was
   held in high respect by a large number of the nobility (one of the many
   things which point to the fact that Congregationalism was by no means
   the creed of the poor and insignificant), and during 1674 both Charles
   and James held prolonged conversations with him in which they assured
   him of their good wishes to the dissenters. Charles gave him 1000
   guineas to relieve those upon whom the severe laws had chiefly pressed.
   In 1674 Owen was attacked by one Dr Sherlock, whom he easily
   vanquished, and from this time until 1680 he was engaged upon his
   ministry and the writing of religious works. In 1680, however,
   Stillingfleet having on May 11 preached his sermon on "The Mischief of
   Separation," Owen defended the Nonconformists from the charge of schism
   in his Brief Vindication. Baxter and Howe also answered Stillingfleet,
   who replied in The Unreasonableness of Separation. Owen again answered
   this, and then left the controversy to a swarm of eager combatants.
   From this time to his death he was occupied with continual writing,
   disturbed only by an absurd charge of being concerned in the Rye House
   Plot. His most important work was his Treatise on Evangelical Churches
   in which were contained his latest views regarding church government.
   During his life he issued more than eighty separate publications, many
   of them of great size. Of these a list may be found in Orme's Memoirs
   of Owen. For some years before his death Owen had suffered greatly from
   stone and asthma. He died quietly, though after great pain, at Ealing,
   on August 24, 1683, and was buried on September 4th in Bunhill Fields,
   being followed to the grave by a large procession of persons of
   distinction. "In younger age a most comely and majestic form; but in
   the latter stages of life, depressed by constant infirmities, emaciated
   with frequent diseases, and above all crushed under the weight of
   intense and unremitting studies, it became an incommodious mansion for
   the vigorous exertions of the spirit in the service of its God."

   Nonconformists' Memorial and Vertue's Sermons and Tracts, 1721. The
   chief authorities for the life are Owen's Works; Orme's Memoirs of

                             Biography of John Owen

   John Owen (1616-August 24, 1683) was an English Nonconformist church
   leader.

   Of Welsh descent, he was born at Stadham in Oxfordshire, and was
   educated at Queen's College, Oxford (B.A. 1632, M.A. 1635); at the time
   the college was noted, according to Thomas Fuller, for its
   metaphysicians. A Puritan by upbringing, in 1637 Owen was driven from
   Oxford by Laud's new statutes, and became chaplain and tutor in the
   family of Sir Robert Dormer and then in that of Lord Lovelace. At the
   outbreak of the English Civil War he sided with the parliament, and
   thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his Welsh
   Royalist uncle's fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard,
   troubled by religious questions. His doubts were removed by a sermon
   preached by a stranger in Aldermanbury Chapel where he had gone
   intending to hear Edmund Calamy the Elder. His first publication, A
   Display of Arminianism (1642), was a spirited defence of rigid
   Calvinism. It was dedicated to the committee of religion, and gained
   him the living of Fordham in Essex, from which a "scandalous minister"
   had been ejected. At Fordham he remained engrossed in the work of his
   parish and writing only The Duty of Pastors and People Distinguished
   until 1646, when, the old incumbent dying, the presentation lapsed to
   the patron, who gave it to some one else.

   He was now, however, becoming known. On April 29, he preached before
   the Long Parliament. In this sermon, and even more in his Country Essay
   for the Practice of Church Government, which he appended to it, his
   tendency to break away from Presbyterianism to the more tolerant
   Independent or Congregational system is plainly seen. Like John Milton,
   he saw little to choose between "new presbyter" and "old priest," and
   disliked a rigid and arbitrary polity by whatever name it was called.
   He became pastor at Coggeshall in Essex, where a large influx of
   Flemish tradesmen provided a congenial Independent atmosphere. His
   adoption of Congregational principles did not affect his theological
   position, and in 1647 he again attacked the Arminians in The Death of
   Death in the Death of Christ, which drew him into long debate with
   Richard Baxter. He made the friendship of Fairfax while the latter was
   besieging Colchester, and urgently addressed the army there against
   religious persecution. He was chosen to preach to parliament on the day
   after the execution of King Charles I, and succeeded in fulfilling his
   task without directly mentioning that event.

   Another sermon preached on April 29, a vigorous plea for sincerity of
   religion in high places, won not only the thanks of parliament but the
   friendship of Oliver Cromwell, who took Owen to Ireland as his
   chaplain, that he might regulate the affairs of Trinity College,
   Dublin, He pleaded with the House of Commons for the religious needs of
   Ireland as some years earlier he had pleaded for those of Wales. In
   1650 he accompanied Cromwell on his Scottish campaign. In March 1651
   Cromwell, as chancellor of Oxford, gave him the deanery of Christ
   Church Cathedral, and made him vice-chancellor in September 1652; in
   both offices he succeeded the Presbyterian, Edward Reynolds.

   During his eight years of official Oxford life Owen showed himself a
   firm disciplinarian, thorough in his methods, though, as John Locke
   testifies, the Aristotelian traditions in education underwent no
   change. With Philip Nye he unmasked the popular astrologer, William
   Lilly, and in spite of his share in condemning two Quakeresses to be
   whipped for disturbing the peace, his rule was not intolerant. Anglican
   services were conducted here and there, and at Christ Church itself the
   Anglican chaplain remained in the college. While little encouragement
   was given to a spirit of free inquiry, Puritanism at Oxford was not
   simply an attempt to force education and culture into "the leaden
   moulds of Calvinistic theology." Owen, unlike many of his
   contemporaries, was more interested in the New Testament than ing the
   Old. During his Oxford years he wrote De Divina Justitia (1653), an
   exposition of the dogma that God cannot forgive sin without, an
   atonement; On Communion with God (1657), which has been called a "piece
   of wise-drawn mysticism"; The Doctrine of the Saints' Perseverance
   (1654), his final attack on Arminianism; Vindiciæ Evangelicæ, a
   treatise written by order of the Council of State against Socinianism
   as expounded by John Biddle; On the Mortification of Sin in Believers
   (1656), an introspective and analytic work; Of Schism (2657), one of
   the most readable of all his writings; Of Temptation (1658), an attempt
   to recall Puritanism to its cardinal spiritual attitude from the
   jarring anarchy of sectarianism and the pharisaism which had followed
   on popularity and threatened to destroy the early simplicity.

   Besides his academic and literary concerns, Owen was continually
   involved in affairs of state. In 1651, on October 24 (after Worcester),
   he preached the thanksgiving sermon before parliament. In 1652 he sat
   on a council to consider the condition of Protestantism in Ireland. In
   October 1653 he was one of several ministers whom Cromwell summoned to
   a consultation as to church union. In December the degree of D.D. was
   conferred upon him by his university. In the parliament of 1654 he sat,
   for a short time, as member for Oxford university, and, with Baxter,
   was placed on the committee for settling the "fundamentals" necessary
   for the toleration promised in the Instrument of Government. In the
   same year he was chairman of a committee on Scottish Church affairs. He
   was, too, one of the Triers, and appears to have behaved with kindness
   and moderation in that capacity. As vice-chancellor he acted with
   readiness and spirit when a Royalist rising in Wiltshire broke out in
   1655; his adherence to Cromwell, however, was by no means slavish, for
   he drew up, at the request of Desborough and Pride, a petition against
   his receiving the kingship. Thus, when Richard Cromwell succeeded his
   father as chancellor, Owen lost his vice-chancellorship. In 1658 he
   took a leading part in the conference of Independents which drew up the
   Savoy Declaration.

   On Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658, Owen joined the Wallingford House
   party, and though he denied any share in the deposition of Richard
   Cromwell, he preferred the idea of a simple republic to that of a
   protectorate. He assisted in the restoration of the Rump Parliament,
   and, when George Monck began his march into England, Owen, in the name
   of the Independent churches, to whom Monck was supposed to belong, and
   who were anxious about his intentions, wrote to dissuade him. In March
   1660, the Presbyterian party being uppermost, Owen was deprived of his
   deanery, which was given back to Reynolds. He retired to Stadham, where
   he wrote various controversial and theological works, in especial the
   laborious Theologoumena Pantodapa, a history of the rise and progress
   of theology. The respect in which many of the authorities held his
   intellectual eminence won him an immunity denied to other
   Nonconformists. In 1661 the celebrated Fiat Lux, a work by the
   Franciscan monk John Vincent Cane, was published; in it, the oneness
   and beauty of Roman Catholicism are contrasted with the confusion and
   multiplicity of Protestant sects. At Clarendon's request Owen answered
   this in 1662 in his Animadversions; and so great was its success that
   he was offered preferment if he would conform. Owen's condition was
   liberty to all who agree in doctrine with the Church of England;
   nothing therefore came of the negotiation.

   In 1663 he was invited by the Congregational churches in Boston,
   Massachusetts, to become their minister, but declined. The Conventicle
   and Five Mile Acts drove him to London; and in 1666, after the Great
   Fire, he, like other leading Nonconformist ministers, set up a room for
   public service and gathered a congregation, composed chiefly of the old
   Commonwealth officers. Meanwhile he was incessantly writing; and in
   1667 he published his Catechism, which led to a proposal, "more acute
   than diplomatic," from Baxter for union. Various papers passed, and
   after a year the attempt was closed by the following laconical note
   from Owen: "I am still a well-wisher to these mathematics." It was now,
   too, that he published the first part of his vast work upon the Epistle
   to the Hebrews, together with his Exposition of Psalm 130 and his
   searching book on Indwelling Sin.

   In 1669 Owen wrote a spirited remonstrance to the Congregationalists in
   New England, who, under the influence of Presbyterianism, had shown
   themselves persecutors. At home, too, he was busy in the same cause. In
   1670 Samuel Parker's Ecclesiastical Polity attacked the Nonconformists
   with clumsy intolerance. Owen answered him (Truth and Innocence
   Vindicated); Parker replied offensively. Then Andrew Marvell finally
   disposed of Parker with banter and satire in The Rehearsal Transposed.
   Owen himself produced a tract On the Trinity (1669), and Christian Love
   and Peace (1672).

   On the revival of the Conventicle Acts in 1670, Owen was appointed to
   draw up a paper of reasons which was submitted to the House of Lords in
   protest. In this or the following year Harvard College invited him to
   become its president; he received similar invitations from some of the
   Dutch universities. When King Charles II issued his Declaration of
   Indulgence in 1672, Owen drew up an address of thanks for the
   opportunity to increase churches and services; Owen was one of the
   first preachers at the weekly lectures which the Independents and
   Presbyterians jointly held at Princes' Hall in Broad Street. He was
   respected by many of the nobility (Congregationalism was by no means
   the creed of the poor and insignificant), and during 1674 both Charles
   II and his brother James assured him of their good wishes to the
   dissenters. Charles gave him 1000 guineas to relieve those upon whom
   the severe laws had chiefly pressed, and he was even able to procure
   the release of John Bunyan, whose preaching he ardently admired. In
   1674 Owen was attacked by William Sherlock, Dean of St Paul's, whom he
   easily vanquished, and from this time until 1680 he was engaged upon
   his ministry and the writing of religious works.

   The chief of these were On Apostasy (1676), a sad account of religion
   under the Restoration; On the Holy Spirit (1677-1678) and The Doctrine
   of Justification (1677). In 1680, however, Stillingfleet having on May
   11 preached his sermon on "The Mischief of Separation," Owen defended
   the Nonconformists from the charge of schism in his Brief Vindication.
   Baxter and Howe also answered Stillingfleet, who replied in The
   Unreasonableness of Separation. Owen again answered this, and then left
   the controversy to a swarm of eager combatants. From this time to his
   death he was occupied with continual writing, disturbed only by
   suffering from stone and asthma, and by art absurd charge of being
   concerned in the Rye House Plot. His most important work was his
   Treatise on Evangelical Churches, in which were contained his latest
   views regarding church government. He died at Ealing, just twenty-one
   years after he had gone out with so many others on St Bartholomew's day
   in 1662, and was buried on September 4 in Bunhill Fields.
