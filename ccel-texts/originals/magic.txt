THE PRELUDE

   Scene: A plantation of thin young trees, in a misty and rainy twilight;
   some woodland blossom showing the patches on the earth between the
   stems.

   The Stranger is discovered, a cloaked figure with a pointed hood. His
   costume might belong to modern or any other time, and the conical hood
   is so drawn over the head that little can be seen of the face.

   A distant voice, a woman's, is heard, half-singing, half-chanting,
   unintelligible words. The cloaked figure raises its head and listens
   with interest. The song draws nearer and Patricia Carleon enters. She
   is dark and slight, and has a dreamy expression. Though she is
   artistically dressed, her hair is a little wild. She has a broken
   branch of some flowering tree in her hand. She does not notice the
   stranger, and though he has watched her with interest, makes no sign.
   Suddenly she perceives him and starts back.

   Patricia. Oh! Who are you?

   Stranger. Ah! Who am I? [Commences to mutter to himself, and maps out
   the ground with his staff.]

   I have a hat, but not to wear;
   I wear a sword, but not to slay,
   And ever in my bag I bear
   A pack of cards, but not to play.

   Patricia. What are you? What are you saying?

   Stranger. It is the language of the fairies, O daughter of Eve.

   Patricia. But I never thought fairies were like you. Why, you are
   taller than I am.

   Stranger. We are of such stature as we will. But the elves grow small,
   not large, when they would mix with mortals.

   Patricia. You mean they are beings greater than we are.

   Stranger. Daughter of men, if you would see a fairy as he truly is,
   look for his head above all the stars and his feet amid the floors of
   the sea. Old women have taught you that the fairies are too small to be
   seen. But I tell you the fairies are too mighty to be seen. For they
   are the elder gods before whom the giants were like pigmies. They are
   the Elemental Spirits, and any one of them is larger than the world.
   And you look for them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that you
   never see them.

   Patricia. But you come in the shape and size of a man?

   Stranger. Because I would speak with a woman.

   Patricia. [Drawing back in awe.] I think you are growing taller as you
   speak.

   [The scene appears to fade away, and give place to the milieu of Act
   One, the Duke's drawing-room, an apartment with open French windows or
   any opening large enough to show a garden and one house fairly near. It
   is evening, and there is a red lamp lighted in the house beyond. The
   Rev. Cyril Smith is sitting with hat and umbrella beside him, evidently
   a visitor. He is a young man with the highest of High Church
   dog-collars and all the qualities of a restrained fanatic. He is one of
   the Christian Socialist sort and takes his priesthood seriously. He is
   an honest man, and not an ass.

   [To him enters Mr. Hastings with papers in his hand.

   Hastings. Oh, good evening. You are Mr. Smith. [Pause.] I mean you are
   the Rector, I think.

   Smith. I am the Rector.

   Hastings. I am the Duke's secretary. His Grace asks me to say that he
   hopes to see you very soon; but he is engaged just now with the Doctor.

   Smith. Is the Duke ill?

   Hastings. [Laughing.] Oh, no; the Doctor has come to ask him to help
   some cause or other. The Duke is never ill.

   Smith. Is the Doctor with him now?

   Hastings. Why, strictly speaking, he is not. The Doctor has gone over
   the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal. But he hasn't
   far to go, as you can see. That's his red lamp at the end of his
   grounds.

   Smith. Yes, I know. I am much obliged to you. I will wait as long as is
   necessary.

   Hastings. [Cheerfully.] Oh, it won't be very long.

   [Exit.

   [Enter by the garden doors Dr. Grimthorpe reading an open paper. He is
   an old-fashioned practitioner, very much of a gentleman and very
   carefully dressed in a slightly antiquated style. He is about sixty
   years old and might have been a friend of Huxley's.

   Doctor. [Folding up the paper.] I beg your pardon, sir, I did not
   notice there was anyone here.

   Smith. [Amicably.] I beg yours. A new clergyman cannot expect to be
   expected. I only came to see the Duke about some local affairs.

   Doctor. [Smiling.] And so, oddly enough, did I. But I suppose we should
   both like to get hold of him by a separate ear.

   Smith. Oh, there's no disguise as far as I'm concerned. I've joined
   this league for starting a model public-house in the parish; and in
   plain words, I've come to ask his Grace for a subscription to it.

   Doctor. [Grimly.] And, as it happens, I have joined in the petition
   against the erection of a model public-house in this parish. The
   similarity of our position grows with every instant.

   Smith. Yes, I think we must have been twins.

   Doctor. [More good-humouredly.] Well, what is a model public-house? Do
   you mean a toy?

   Smith. I mean a place where Englishmen can get decent drink and drink
   it decently. Do you call that a toy?

   Doctor. No; I should call that a conjuring trick. Or, in apology to
   your cloth, I will say a miracle.

   Smith. I accept the apology to my cloth. I am doing my duty as a
   priest. How can the Church have a right to make men fast if she does
   not allow them to feast?

   Doctor. [Bitterly.] And when you have done feasting them, you will send
   them to me to be cured.

   Smith. Yes; and when you've done curing them you'll send them to me to
   be buried.

   Doctor. [After a pause, laughing.] Well, you have all the old
   doctrines. It is only fair you should have all the old jokes too.

   Smith. [Laughing also.] By the way, you call it a conjuring trick that
   poor people should drink moderately.

   Doctor. I call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food.

   Smith. You don't drink wine yourself?

   Doctor. [Mildly startled.] Drink wine! Well--what else is there to
   drink?

   Smith. So drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do,
   anyhow?

   Doctor. [Still good-humouredly.] Well, well, let us hope so. Talking
   about conjuring tricks, there is to be conjuring and all kinds of
   things here this afternoon.

   Smith. Conjuring? Indeed? Why is that?

   Enter Hastings with a letter in each hand.

   Hastings. His Grace will be with you presently. He asked me to deal
   with the business matter first of all.

   [He gives a note to each of them.

   Smith. [Turning eagerly to the Doctor.] But this is rather splendid.
   The Duke's given £50 to the new public-house.

   Hastings. The Duke is very liberal.

   [Collects papers.

   Doctor. [Examining his cheque.] Very. But this is rather curious. He
   has also given £50 to the league for opposing the new public-house.

   Hastings. The Duke is very liberal-minded.

   [Exit.

   Smith. [Staring at his cheque.] Liberal-minded!... Absent-minded, I
   should call it.

   Doctor. [Sitting down and lighting a cigar.] Well, yes. The Duke does
   suffer a little from absence [puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls
   during the pause] of mind. He is all for compromise. Don't you know the
   kind of man who, when you talk to him about the five best breeds of
   dog, always ends up by buying a mongrel? The Duke is the kindest of
   men, and always trying to please everybody. He generally finishes by
   pleasing nobody.

   Smith. Yes; I think I know the sort of thing.

   Doctor. Take this conjuring, for instance. You know the Duke has two
   wards who are to live with him now?

   Smith. Yes. I heard something about a nephew and niece from Ireland.

   Doctor. The niece came from Ireland some months ago, but the nephew
   comes back from America to-night. [He gets up abruptly and walks about
   the room.] I think I will tell you all about it. In spite of your
   precious public-house you seem to me to be a sane man. And I fancy I
   shall want all the sane men I can get to-night.

   Smith. [Rising also.] I am at your service. Do you know, I rather
   guessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious
   public-house.

   Doctor. [Striding about in subdued excitement.] Well, you guessed
   right. I was family physician to the Duke's brother in Ireland. I knew
   the family pretty well.

   Smith. [Quietly.] I suppose you mean you knew something odd about the
   family?

   Doctor. Well, they saw fairies and things of that sort.

   Smith. And I suppose, to the medical mind, seeing fairies means much
   the same as seeing snakes?

   Doctor. [With a sour smile.] Well, they saw them in Ireland. I suppose
   it's quite correct to see fairies in Ireland. It's like gambling at
   Monte Carlo. It's quite respectable. But I do draw the line at their
   seeing fairies in England. I do object to their bringing their ghosts
   and goblins and witches into the poor Duke's own back garden and within
   a yard of my own red lamp. It shows a lack of tact.

   Smith. But I do understand that the Duke's nephew and niece see witches
   and fairies between here and your lamp.

   [He walks to the garden window and looks out.

   Doctor. Well, the nephew has been in America. It stands to reason you
   can't see fairies in America. But there is this sort of superstition in
   the family, and I am not easy in my mind about the girl.

   Smith. Why, what does she do?

   Doctor. Oh, she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings.
   Damp evenings for choice. She calls it the Celtic twilight. I've no use
   for the Celtic twilight myself. It has a tendency to get on the chest.
   But what is worse, she is always talking about meeting somebody, some
   elf or wizard or something. I don't like it at all.

   Smith. Have you told the Duke?

   Doctor. [With a grim smile.] Oh, yes, I told the Duke. The result was
   the conjurer.

   Smith. [With amazement.] The conjurer?

   Doctor. [Puts down his cigar in the ash-tray.] The Duke is
   indescribable. He will be here presently, and you shall judge for
   yourself. Put two or three facts or ideas before him, and the thing he
   makes out of them is always something that seems to have nothing to do
   with it. Tell any other human being about a girl dreaming of the
   fairies and her practical brother from America, and he would settle it
   in some obvious way and satisfy some one: send her to America or let
   her have her fairies in Ireland. Now the Duke thinks a conjurer would
   just meet the case. I suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten
   things up, and somehow satisfy the believers' interest in supernatural
   things and the unbelievers' interest in smart things. As a matter of
   fact the unbeliever thinks the conjurer's a fraud, and the believer
   thinks he's a fraud, too. The conjurer satisfies nobody. That is why he
   satisfies the Duke.

   [Enter the Duke, with Hastings, carrying papers. The Duke is a healthy,
   hearty man in tweeds, with a rather wandering eye. In the present state
   of the peerage it is necessary to explain that the Duke, though an ass,
   is a gentleman.

   Duke. Good-morning, Mr. Smith. So sorry to have kept you waiting, but
   we're rather in a rush to-day. [Turns to Hastings, who has gone over to
   a table with the papers.] You know Mr. Carleon is coming this
   afternoon?

   Hastings. Yes, your Grace. His train will be in by now. I have sent the
   trap.

   Duke. Thank you. [Turning to the other two.] My nephew, Dr. Grimthorpe,
   Morris, you know, Miss Carleon's brother from America. I hear he's been
   doing great things out there. Petrol, or something. Must move with the
   times, eh?

   Doctor. I'm afraid Mr. Smith doesn't always agree with moving with the
   times.

   Duke. Oh, come, come! Progress, you know, progress! Of course I know
   how busy you are; you mustn't overwork yourself, you know. Hastings was
   telling me you laughed over those subscriptions of mine. Well, well, I
   believe in looking at both sides of a question, you know. Aspects, as
   old Buffle called them. Aspects. [With an all-embracing gesture of the
   arm.] You represent the tendency to drink in moderation, and you do
   good in your way. The Doctor represents the tendency not to drink at
   all; and he does good in his way. We can't be Ancient Britons, you
   know.

   [A prolonged and puzzled silence, such as always follows the more
   abrupt of the Duke's associations or disassociations of thought.

   Smith. [At last, faintly.] Ancient Britons....

   Doctor. [To Smith in a low voice.] Don't bother. It's only his
   broad-mindedness.

   Duke. [With unabated cheerfulness.] I saw the place you're putting up
   for it, Mr. Smith. Very good work. Very good work, indeed. Art for the
   people, eh? I particularly liked that woodwork over the west door--I'm
   glad to see you're using the new sort of graining ... why, it all
   reminds one of the French Revolution.

   [Another silence. As the Duke lounges alertly about the room, Smith
   speaks to the Doctor in an undertone.

   Smith. Does it remind you of the French Revolution?

   Doctor. As much as of anything else. His Grace never reminds me of
   anything.

   [A young and very high American voice is heard calling in the garden.
   "Say, could somebody see to one of these trunks?"

   [Mr. Hastings goes out into the garden. He returns with Morris Carleon,
   a very young man: hardly more than a boy, but with very grown-up
   American dress and manners. He is dark, smallish, and active; and the
   racial type under his Americanism is Irish.

   Morris. [Humorously, as he puts in his head at the window.] See here,
   does a Duke live here?

   Doctor. [Who is nearest to him, with great gravity.] Yes, only one.

   Morris. I reckon he's the one I want, anyhow. I'm his nephew.

   [The Duke, who is ruminating in the foreground, with one eye rather
   off, turns at the voice and shakes Morris warmly by the hand.

   Duke. Delighted to see you, my dear boy. I hear you've been doing very
   well for yourself.

   Morris. [Laughing.] Well, pretty well, Duke; and better still for Paul
   T. Vandam, I guess. I manage the old man's mines out in Arizona, you
   know.

   Duke. [Shaking his head sagaciously.] Ah, very go-ahead man! Very
   go-ahead methods, I'm told. Well, I dare say he does a great deal of
   good with his money. And we can't go back to the Spanish Inquisition.

   [Silence, during which the three men look at each other.

   Morris. [Abruptly.] And how's Patricia?

   Duke. [A little hazily.] Oh, she's very well, I think. She....

   [He hesitates slightly.

   Morris. [Smiling.] Well, then, where's Patricia?

   [There is a slightly embarrassed pause, and the Doctor speaks.

   Doctor. Miss Carleon is walking about the grounds, I think.

   [Morris goes to the garden doors and looks out.

   Morris. It's a mighty chilly night to choose. Does my sister commonly
   select such evenings to take the air--and the damp?

   Doctor. [After a pause.] If I may say so, I quite agree with you. I
   have often taken the liberty of warning your sister against going out
   in all weathers like this.

   Duke. [Expansively waving his hands about.] The artist temperament!
   What I always call the artistic temperament! Wordsworth, you know, and
   all that.

   [Silence.

   Morris. [Staring.] All what?

   Duke. [Continuing to lecture with enthusiasm.] Why, everything's
   temperament, you know! It's her temperament to see the fairies. It's my
   temperament not to see the fairies. Why, I've walked all round the
   grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy. Well, it's like that about
   this wizard or whatever she calls it. For her there is somebody there.
   For us there would not be somebody there. Don't you see?

   Morris. [Advancing excitedly.] Somebody there! What do you mean?

   Duke. [Airily.] Well, you can't quite call it a man.

   Morris. [Violently.] A man!

   Duke. Well, as old Buffle used to say, what is a man?

   Morris. [With a strong rise of the American accent.] With your
   permission, Duke, I eliminate old Buffle. Do you mean that anybody has
   had the tarnation coolness to suggest that some man....

   Duke. Oh, not a man, you know. A magician, something mythical, you
   know.

   Smith. Not a man, but a medicine man.

   Doctor. [Grimly.] I am a medicine man.

   Morris. And you don't look mythical, Doc.

   [He bites his finger and begins to pace restlessly up and down the
   room.

   Duke. Well, you know, the artistic temperament....

   Morris. [Turning suddenly.] See here, Duke! In most commercial ways
   we're a pretty forward country. In these moral ways we're content to be
   a pretty backward country. And if you ask me whether I like my sister
   walking about the woods on a night like this! Well, I don't.

   Duke. I am afraid you Americans aren't so advanced as I'd hoped. Why!
   as old Buffle used to say....

   [As he speaks a distant voice is heard singing in the garden; it comes
   nearer and nearer, and Smith turns suddenly to the Doctor.

   Smith. Whose voice is that?

   Doctor. It is no business of mine to decide!

   Morris. [Walking to the window.] You need not trouble. I know who it
   is.

   Enter Patricia Carleon

   [Still agitated.] Patricia, where have you been?

   Patricia. [Rather wearily.] Oh! in Fairyland.

   Doctor. [Genially.] And whereabouts is that?

   Patricia. It's rather different from other places. It's either nowhere
   or it's wherever you are.

   Morris. [Sharply.] Has it any inhabitants?

   Patricia. Generally only two. Oneself and one's shadow. But whether he
   is my shadow or I am his shadow is never found out.

   Morris. He? Who?

   Patricia. [Seeming to understand his annoyance for the first time, and
   smiling.] Oh, you needn't get conventional about it, Morris. He is not
   a mortal.

   Morris. What's his name?

   Patricia. We have no names there. You never really know anybody if you
   know his name.

   Morris. What does he look like?

   Patricia. I have only met him in the twilight. He seems robed in a long
   cloak, with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories.
   Sometimes when I look out of the window here, I see him passing round
   this house like a shadow; and see his pointed hood, dark against the
   sunset or the rising of the moon.

   Smith. What does he talk about?

   Patricia. He tells me the truth. Very many true things. He is a wizard.

   Morris. How do you know he's a wizard? I suppose he plays some tricks
   on you.

   Patricia. I should know he was a wizard if he played no tricks. But
   once he stooped and picked up a stone and cast it into the air, and it
   flew up into God's heaven like a bird.

   Morris. Was that what first made you think he was a wizard?

   Patricia. Oh, no. When I first saw him he was tracing circles and
   pentacles in the grass and talking the language of the elves.

   Morris. [Sceptically.] Do you know the language of the elves?

   Patricia. Not until I heard it.

   Morris. [Lowering his voice as if for his sister, but losing patience
   so completely that he talks much louder than he imagines.] See here,
   Patricia, I reckon this kind of thing is going to be the limit. I'm
   just not going to have you let in by some blamed tramp or
   fortune-teller because you choose to read minor poetry about the
   fairies. If this gipsy or whatever he is troubles you again....

   Doctor. [Putting his hand on Morris's shoulder.] Come, you must allow a
   little more for poetry. We can't all feed on nothing but petrol.

   Duke. Quite right, quite right. And being Irish, don't you know,
   Celtic, as old Buffle used to say, charming songs, you know, about the
   Irish girl who has a plaid shawl--and a Banshee. [Sighs profoundly.]
   Poor old Gladstone!

   [Silence as usual.

   Smith. [Speaking to Doctor.] I thought you yourself considered the
   family superstition bad for the health?

   Doctor. I consider a family superstition is better for the health than
   a family quarrel. [He walks casually across to Patricia.] Well, it must
   be nice to be young and still see all those stars and sunsets. We old
   buffers won't be too strict with you if your view of things sometimes
   gets a bit--mixed up, shall we say? If the stars get loose about the
   grass by mistake; or if, once or twice, the sunset gets into the east.
   We should only say, "Dream as much as you like. Dream for all mankind.
   Dream for us who can dream no longer. But do not quite forget the
   difference."

   Patricia. What difference?

   Doctor. The difference between the things that are beautiful and the
   things that are there. That red lamp over my door isn't beautiful; but
   it's there. You might even come to be glad it is there, when the stars
   of gold and silver have faded. I am an old man now, but some men are
   still glad to find my red star. I do not say they are the wise men.

   Patricia. [Somewhat affected.] Yes, I know you are good to everybody.
   But don't you think there may be floating and spiritual stars which
   will last longer than the red lamps?

   Smith. [With decision.] Yes. But they are fixed stars.

   Doctor. The red lamp will last my time.

   Duke. Capital! Capital! Why, it's like Tennyson. [Silence.] I remember
   when I was an undergrad....

   [The red light disappears; no one sees it at first except Patricia, who
   points excitedly.

   Morris. What's the matter?

   Patricia. The red star is gone.

   Morris. Nonsense! [Rushes to the garden doors.] It's only somebody
   standing in front of it. Say, Duke, there's somebody standing in the
   garden.

   Patricia. [Calmly.] I told you he walked about the garden.

   Morris. If it's that fortune-teller of yours....

   [Disappears into the garden, followed by the Doctor.

   Duke. [Staring.] Somebody in the garden! Really, this Land Campaign....

   [Silence.

   [Morris reappears rather breathless.

   Morris. A spry fellow, your friend. He slipped through my hands like a
   shadow.

   Patricia. I told you he was a shadow.

   Morris. Well, I guess there's going to be a shadow hunt. Got a lantern,
   Duke?

   Patricia. Oh, you need not trouble. He will come if I call him.

   [She goes out into the garden and calls out some half-chanted and
   unintelligible words, somewhat like the song preceding her entrance.
   The red light reappears; and there is a slight sound as of fallen
   leaves shuffled by approaching feet. The cloaked Stranger with the
   pointed hood is seen standing outside the garden doors.

   Patricia. You may enter all doors.

   [The figure comes into the room

   Morris. [Shutting the garden doors behind him.] Now, see here, wizard,
   we've got you. And we know you're a fraud.

   Smith. [Quietly.] Pardon me, I do not fancy that we know that. For
   myself I must confess to something of the Doctor's agnosticism.

   Morris. [Excited, and turning almost with a snarl.] I didn't know you
   parsons stuck up for any fables but your own.

   Smith. I stick up for the thing every man has a right to. Perhaps the
   only thing that every man has a right to.

   Morris. And what is that?

   Smith. The benefit of the doubt. Even your master, the petroleum
   millionaire, has a right to that. And I think he needs it more.

   Morris. I don't think there's much doubt about the question, Minister.
   I've met this sort of fellow often enough--the sort of fellow who
   wheedles money out of girls by telling them he can make stones
   disappear.

   Doctor. [To the Stranger.] Do you say you can make stones disappear?

   Stranger. Yes. I can make stones disappear.

   Morris. [Roughly.] I reckon you're the kind of tough who knows how to
   make a watch and chain disappear.

   Stranger. Yes; I know how to make a watch and chain disappear.

   Morris. And I should think you were pretty good at disappearing
   yourself.

   Stranger. I have done such a thing.

   Morris. [With a sneer.] Will you disappear now?

   Stranger. [After reflection.] No, I think I'll appear instead. [He
   throws back his hood, showing the head of an intellectual-looking man,
   young but rather worn. Then he unfastens his cloak and throws it off,
   emerging in complete modern evening dress. He advances down the room
   towards the Duke, taking out his watch as he does so.] Good-evening,
   your Grace. I'm afraid I'm rather too early for the performance. But
   this gentleman [with a gesture towards Morris] seemed rather impatient
   for it to begin.

   Duke. [Rather at a loss.] Oh, good-evening. Why, really--are you
   the...?

   Stranger. [Bowing.] Yes. I am the Conjurer.

   [There is general laughter, except from Patricia. As the others mingle
   in talk, the Stranger goes up to her.

   Stranger. [Very sadly.] I am very sorry I am not a wizard.

   Patricia. I wish you were a thief instead.

   Stranger. Have I committed a worse crime than thieving?

   Patricia. You have committed the cruellest crime, I think, that there
   is.

   Stranger. And what is the cruellest crime?

   Patricia. Stealing a child's toy.

   Stranger. And what have I stolen?

   Patricia. A fairy tale.

   CURTAIN
     __________________________________________________________________

ACT II

   The same room lighted more brilliantly an hour later in the evening. On
   one side a table covered with packs of cards, pyramids, etc., at which
   the Conjurer in evening dress is standing quietly setting out his
   tricks. A little more in the foreground the Duke; and Hastings with a
   number of papers.

   Hastings. There are only a few small matters. Here are the programmes
   of the entertainment your Grace wanted. Mr. Carleon wishes to see them
   very much.

   Duke. Thanks, thanks. [Takes the programmes.]

   Hastings. Shall I carry them for your Grace?

   Duke. No, no; I shan't forget, I shan't forget. Why, you've no idea how
   businesslike I am. We have to be, you know. [Vaguely.] I know you're a
   bit of a Socialist; but I assure you there's a good deal to do--stake
   in the country, and all that. Look at remembering faces now! The King
   never forgets faces. [Waves the programmes about.] I never forget
   faces. [Catches sight of the Conjurer and genially draws him into the
   discussion.] Why, the Professor here who performs before the King [puts
   down the programmes]--you see it on the caravans, you know--performs
   before the King almost every night, I suppose....

   Conjurer. [Smiling.] I sometimes let his Majesty have an evening off.
   And turn my attention, of course, to the very highest nobility. But
   naturally I have performed before every sovereign potentate, white and
   black. There never was a conjurer who hadn't.

   Duke. That's right, that's right! And you'll say with me that the great
   business for a King is remembering people?

   Conjurer. I should say it was remembering which people to remember.

   Duke. Well, well, now.... [Looks round rather wildly for something.]
   Being really businesslike....

   Hastings. Shall I take the programmes for your Grace?

   Duke. [Picking them up.] No, no, I shan't forget. Is there anything
   else?

   Hastings. I have to go down the village about the wire to Stratford.
   The only other thing at all urgent is the Militant Vegetarians.

   Duke. Ah! The Militant Vegetarians! You've heard of them, I'm sure.
   Won't obey the law [to the Conjurer] so long as the Government serves
   out meat.

   Conjurer. Let them be comforted. There are a good many people who don't
   get much meat.

   Duke. Well, well, I'm bound to say they're very enthusiastic. Advanced,
   too--oh, certainly advanced. Like Joan of Arc.

   [Short silence, in which the Conjurer stares at him.]

   Conjurer. Was Joan of Arc a Vegetarian?

   Duke. Oh, well, it's a very high ideal, after all. The Sacredness of
   Life, you know--the Sacredness of Life. [Shakes his head.] But they
   carry it too far. They killed a policeman down in Kent.

   Conjurer. Killed a policeman? How Vegetarian! Well, I suppose it was,
   so long as they didn't eat him.

   Hastings. They are asking only for small subscriptions. Indeed, they
   prefer to collect a large number of half-crowns, to prove the
   popularity of their movement. But I should advise....

   Duke. Oh, give them three shillings, then.

   Hastings. If I might suggest....

   Duke. Hang it all! We gave the Anti-Vegetarians three shillings. It
   seems only fair.

   Hastings. If I might suggest anything, I think your Grace will be wise
   not to subscribe in this case. The Anti-Vegetarians have already used
   their funds to form gangs ostensibly to protect their own meetings. And
   if the Vegetarians use theirs to break up the meetings--well, it will
   look rather funny that we have paid roughs on both sides. It will be
   rather difficult to explain when it comes before the magistrate.

   Duke. But I shall be the magistrate. [Conjurer stares at him again.]
   That's the system, my dear Hastings, that's the advantage of the
   system. Not a logical system--no Rousseau in it--but see how well it
   works! I shall be the very best magistrate that could be on the Bench.
   The others would be biassed, you know. Old Sir Lawrence is a Vegetarian
   himself; and might be hard on the Anti-Vegetarian roughs. Colonel
   Crashaw would be sure to be hard on the Vegetarian roughs. But if I've
   paid both of 'em, of course I shan't be hard on either of 'em--and
   there you have it. Just perfect impartiality.

   Hastings. [Restrainedly.] Shall I take the programmes, your Grace?

   Duke. [Heartily.] No, no; I won't forget 'em. [Exit Hastings.] Well,
   Professor, what's the news in the conjuring world?

   Conjurer. I fear there is never any news in the conjuring world.

   Duke. Don't you have a newspaper or something? Everybody has a
   newspaper now, you know. The--er--Daily Sword-Swallower or that sort of
   thing?

   Conjurer. No, I have been a journalist myself; but I think journalism
   and conjuring will always be incompatible.

   Duke. Incompatible--Oh, but that's where I differ--that's where I take
   larger views! Larger laws, as old Buffle said. Nothing's incompatible,
   you know--except husband and wife and so on; you must talk to Morris
   about that. It's wonderful the way incompatibility has gone forward in
   the States.

   Conjurer. I only mean that the two trades rest on opposite principles.
   The whole point of being a conjurer is that you won't explain a thing
   that has happened.

   Duke. Well, and the journalist?

   Conjurer. Well, the whole point of being a journalist is that you do
   explain a thing that hasn't happened.

   Duke. But you'll want somewhere to discuss the new tricks.

   Conjurer. There are no new tricks. And if there were we shouldn't want
   'em discussed.

   Duke. I'm afraid you're not really advanced. Are you interested in
   modern progress?

   Conjurer. Yes. We are interested in all tricks done by illusion.

   Duke. Well, well, I must go and see how Morris is. Pleasure of seeing
   you later.

   [Exit Duke, leaving the programmes.

   Conjurer. Why are nice men such asses? [Turns to arrange the table.]
   That seems all right. The pack of cards that is a pack of cards. And
   the pack of cards that isn't a pack of cards. The hat that looks like a
   gentleman's hat. But which, in reality, is no gentleman's hat. Only my
   hat; and I am not a gentleman. I am only a conjurer, and this is only a
   conjurer's hat. I could not take off this hat to a lady. I can take
   rabbits out of it, goldfish out of it, snakes out of it. Only I mustn't
   take my own head out of it. I suppose I'm a lower animal than a rabbit
   or a snake. Anyhow they can get out of the conjurer's hat; and I can't.
   I am a conjurer and nothing else but a conjurer. Unless I could show I
   was something else, and that would be worse.

   [He begins to dash the cards rather irregularly about the table. Enter
   Patricia.

   Patricia. [Coldly] I beg your pardon. I came to get some programmes. My
   uncle wants them.

   [She walks swiftly across and takes up the programmes.

   Conjurer. [Still dashing cards about the table.] Miss Carleon, might I
   speak to you a moment? [He puts his hands in his pockets, stares at the
   table; and his face assumes a sardonic expression.] The question is
   purely practical.

   Patricia. [Pausing at the door.] I can hardly imagine what the question
   can be.

   Conjurer. I am the question.

   Patricia. And what have I to do with that?

   Conjurer. You have everything to do with it. I am the question: you....

   Patricia. [Angrily.] Well, what am I?

   Conjurer. You are the answer.

   Patricia. The answer to what?

   Conjurer. [Coming round to the front of the table and sitting against
   it.] The answer to me. You think I'm a liar because I walked about the
   fields with you and said I could make stones disappear. Well, so I can.
   I'm a conjurer. In mere point of fact, it wasn't a lie. But if it had
   been a lie I should have told it just the same. I would have told
   twenty such lies. You may or may not know why.

   Patricia. I know nothing about such lies.

   [She puts her hand on the handle of the door, but the Conjurer, who is
   sitting on the table and staring at his boots, does not notice the
   action, and goes on as in a sincere soliloquy.

   Conjurer. I don't know whether you have any notion of what it means to
   a man like me to talk to a lady like you, even on false pretences. I am
   an adventurer. I am a blackguard, if one can earn the title by being in
   all the blackguard societies of the world. I have thought everything
   out by myself, when I was a guttersnipe in Fleet Street, or, lower
   still, a journalist in Fleet Street. Before I met you I never guessed
   that rich people ever thought at all. Well, that is all I have to say.
   We had some good conversations, didn't we? I am a liar. But I told you
   a great deal of the truth.

   [He turns and resumes the arrangement of the table.

   Patricia. [Thinking.] Yes, you did tell me a great deal of the truth.
   You told me hundreds and thousands of truths. But you never told me the
   truth that one wants to know.

   Conjurer. And what is that?

   Patricia. [Turning back into the room.] You never told me the truth
   about yourself. You never told me you were only the Conjurer.

   Conjurer. I did not tell you that because I do not even know it. I do
   not know whether I am only the Conjurer....

   Patricia. What do you mean?

   Conjurer. Sometimes I am afraid I am something worse than the Conjurer.

   Patricia. [Seriously.] I cannot think of anything worse than a conjurer
   who does not call himself a conjurer.

   Conjurer. [Gloomily.] There is something worse. [Rallying himself.] But
   that is not what I want to say. Do you really find that very
   unpardonable? Come, let me put you a case. Never mind about whether it
   is our case. A man spends his time incessantly in going about in
   third-class carriages to fifth-rate lodgings. He has to make up new
   tricks, new patter, new nonsense, sometimes every night of his life.
   Mostly he has to do it in the beastly black cities of the Midlands and
   the North, where he can't get out into the country. Now and again he
   does it at some gentleman's country-house, where he can get out into
   the country. Well, you know that actors and orators and all sorts of
   people like to rehearse their effects in the open air if they can.
   [Smiles.] You know that story of the great statesman who was heard by
   his own gardener saying, as he paced the garden, "Had I, Mr. Speaker,
   received the smallest intimation that I could be called upon to speak
   this evening...." [Patricia controls a smile, and he goes on with
   overwhelming enthusiasm.] Well, conjurers are just the same. It takes
   some time to prepare an impromptu. A man like that walks about the
   woods and fields doing all his tricks beforehand, and talking all sorts
   of gibberish because he thinks he is alone. One evening this man found
   he was not alone. He found a very beautiful child was watching him.

   Patricia. A child?

   Conjurer. Yes. That was his first impression. He is an intimate friend
   of mine. I have known him all my life. He tells me he has since
   discovered she is not a child. She does not fulfil the definition.

   Patricia. What is the definition of a child?

   Conjurer. Somebody you can play with.

   Patricia. [Abruptly.] Why did you wear that cloak with the hood up?

   Conjurer. [Smiling.] I think it escaped your notice that it was
   raining.

   Patricia. [Smiling faintly.] And what did this friend of yours do?

   Conjurer. You have already told me what he did. He destroyed a fairy
   tale, for he created a fairy tale that he was bound to destroy.
   [Swinging round suddenly on the table.] But do you blame a man very
   much, Miss Carleon, if he enjoyed the only fairy tale he had had in his
   life? Suppose he said the silly circles he was drawing for practice
   were really magic circles? Suppose he said the bosh he was talking was
   the language of the elves? Remember, he has read fairy tales as much as
   you have. Fairy tales are the only democratic institutions. All the
   classes have heard all the fairy tales. Do you blame him very much if
   he, too, tried to have a holiday in fairyland?

   Patricia. [Simply.] I blame him less than I did. But I still say there
   can be nothing worse than false magic. And, after all, it was he who
   brought the false magic.

   Conjurer. [Rising from his seat.] Yes. It was she who brought the real
   magic.

   [Enter Morris, in evening-dress. He walks straight up to the
   conjuring-table; and picks up one article after another, putting each
   down with a comment.

   Morris. I know that one. I know that. I know that. Let's see, that's
   the false bottom, I think. That works with a wire. I know that; it goes
   up the sleeve. That's the false bottom again. That's the substituted
   pack of cards--that....

   Patricia. Really, Morris, you mustn't talk as if you knew everything.

   Conjurer. Oh, I don't mind anyone knowing everything, Miss Carleon.
   There is something that is much more important than knowing how a thing
   is done.

   Morris. And what's that?

   Conjurer. Knowing how to do it.

   Morris. [Becoming nasal again in anger.] That's so, eh? Being the
   high-toned conjurer because you can't any longer take all the sidewalk
   as a fairy.

   Patricia. [Crossing the room and speaking seriously to her brother.]
   Really, Morris, you are very rude. And it's quite ridiculous to be
   rude. This gentleman was only practising some tricks by himself in the
   garden. [With a certain dignity.] If there was any mistake, it was
   mine. Come, shake hands, or whatever men do when they apologize. Don't
   be silly. He won't turn you into a bowl of goldfish.

   Morris. [Reluctantly.] Well, I guess that's so. [Offering his hand.]
   Shake. [They shake hands.] And you won't turn me into a bowl of
   goldfish anyhow, Professor. I understand that when you do produce a
   bowl of goldfish, they are generally slips of carrot. That is so,
   Professor?

   Conjurer. [Sharply.] Yes. [Produces a bowl of goldfish from his tail
   pockets and holds it under the other's nose.] Judge for yourself.

   Morris. [In monstrous excitement.] Very good! Very good! But I know how
   that's done--I know how that's done. You have an india-rubber cap, you
   know, or cover....

   Conjurer. Yes.

   [Goes back gloomily to his table and sits on it, picking up a pack of
   cards and balancing it in his hand.

   Morris. Ah, most mysteries are tolerably plain if you know the
   apparatus. [Enter Doctor and Smith, talking with grave faces, but
   growing silent as they reach the group.] I guess I wish we had all the
   old apparatus of all the old Priests and Prophets since the beginning
   of the world. I guess most of the old miracles and that were a matter
   of just panel and wires.

   Conjurer. I don't quite understand you. What old apparatus do you want
   so much?

   Morris. [Breaking out with all the frenzy of the young free-thinker.]
   Well, sir, I just want that old apparatus that turned rods into snakes.
   I want those smart appliances, sir, that brought water out of a rock
   when old man Moses chose to hit it. I guess it's a pity we've lost the
   machinery. I would like to have those old conjurers here that called
   themselves Patriarchs and Prophets in your precious Bible....

   Patricia. Morris, you mustn't talk like that.

   Morris. Well, I don't believe in religion....

   Doctor. [Aside.] Hush, hush. Nobody but women believe in religion.

   Patricia. [Humorously.] I think this is a fitting opportunity to show
   you another ancient conjuring trick.

   Doctor. Which one is that?

   Patricia. The Vanishing Lady!

   [Exit Patricia.

   Smith. There is one part of their old apparatus I regret especially
   being lost.

   Morris. [Still excited.] Yes!

   Smith. The apparatus for writing the Book of Job.

   Morris. Well, well, they didn't know everything in those old times.

   Smith. No, and in those old times they knew they didn't. [Dreamily.]
   Where shall wisdom be found, and what is the place of understanding?

   Conjurer. Somewhere in America, I believe.

   Smith. [Still dreamily.] Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is
   it found in the land of the living. The deep sayeth it is not in me,
   the sea sayeth it is not with me. Death and destruction say we have
   heard tell of it. God understandeth the way thereof and He knoweth the
   place thereof. For He looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under
   the whole Heaven. But to man He hath said: Behold the fear of the Lord
   that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding. [Turns
   suddenly to the Doctor.] How's that for Agnosticism, Dr. Grimthorpe?
   What a pity that apparatus is lost.

   Morris. Well, you may just smile how you choose, I reckon. But I say
   the Conjurer here could be the biggest man in the big blessed centuries
   if he could just show us how the Holy old tricks were done. We must say
   this for old man Moses, that he was in advance of his time. When he did
   the old tricks they were new tricks. He got the pull on the public. He
   could do his tricks before grown men, great bearded fighting men who
   could win battles and sing Psalms. But this modern conjuring is all
   behind the times. That's why they only do it with schoolboys. There
   isn't a trick on that table I don't know. The whole trade's as dead as
   mutton; and not half so satisfying. Why he [pointing to the Conjurer]
   brought out a bowl of goldfish just now--an old trick that anybody
   could do.

   Conjurer. Oh, I quite agree. The apparatus is perfectly simple. By the
   way, let me have a look at those goldfish of yours, will you?

   Morris. [Angrily.] I'm not a paid play-actor come here to conjure. I'm
   not here to do stale tricks; I'm here to see through 'em. I say it's an
   old trick and....

   Conjurer. True. But as you said, we never show it except to schoolboys.

   Morris. And may I ask you, Professor Hocus Pocus, or whatever your name
   is, whom you are calling a schoolboy?

   Conjurer. I beg your pardon. Your sister will tell you I am sometimes
   mistaken about children.

   Morris. I forbid you to appeal to my sister.

   Conjurer. That is exactly what a schoolboy would do.

   Morris. [With abrupt and dangerous calm.] I am not a schoolboy,
   Professor. I am a quiet business man. But I tell you in the country I
   come from, the hand of a quiet business man goes to his hip pocket at
   an insult like that.

   Conjurer. [Fiercely.] Let it go to his pocket! I thought the hand of a
   quiet business man more often went to someone else's pocket.

   Morris. You....

   [Puts his hand to his hip. The Doctor puts his hand on his shoulder.

   Doctor. Gentlemen, I think you are both forgetting yourselves.

   Conjurer. Perhaps. [His tone sinks suddenly to weariness.] I ask pardon
   for what I said. It was certainly in excess of the young gentleman's
   deserts. [Sighs.] I sometimes rather wish I could forget myself.

   Morris. [Sullenly, after a pause.] Well, the entertainment's coming on;
   and you English don't like a scene. I reckon I'll have to bury the
   blamed old hatchet too.

   Doctor. [With a certain dignity, his social type shining through his
   profession.] Mr. Carleon, you will forgive an old man, who knew your
   father well, if he doubts whether you are doing yourself justice in
   treating yourself as an American Indian, merely because you have lived
   in America. In my old friend Huxley's time we of the middle classes
   disbelieved in reason and all sorts of things. But we did believe in
   good manners. It is a pity if the aristocracy can't. I don't like to
   hear you say you are a savage and have buried a tomahawk. I would
   rather hear you say, as your Irish ancestors would have said, that you
   have sheathed your sword with the dignity proper to a gentleman.

   Morris. Very well. I've sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a
   gentleman.

   Conjurer. And I have sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a
   conjurer.

   Morris. How does the Conjurer sheath a sword?

   Conjurer. Swallows it.

   Doctor. Then we all agree there shall be no quarrel.

   Smith. May I say a word? I have a great dislike of a quarrel, for a
   reason quite beyond my duty to my cloth.

   Morris. And what is that?

   Smith. I object to a quarrel because it always interrupts an argument.
   May I bring you back for a moment to the argument? You were saying that
   these modern conjuring tricks are simply the old miracles when they
   have once been found out. But surely another view is possible. When we
   speak of things being sham, we generally mean that they are imitations
   of things that are genuine. Take that Reynolds over there of the Duke's
   great-grandfather. [Points to a picture on the wall.] If I were to say
   it was a copy....

   Morris. Wal, the Duke's real amiable; but I reckon you'd find what you
   call the interruption of an argument.

   Smith. Well, suppose I did say so, you wouldn't take it as meaning that
   Sir Joshua Reynolds never lived. Why should sham miracles prove to us
   that real Saints and Prophets never lived. There may be sham magic and
   real magic also.

   [The Conjurer raises his head and listens with a strange air of
   intentness.

   Smith. There may be turnip ghosts precisely because there are real
   ghosts. There may be theatrical fairies precisely because there are
   real fairies. You do not abolish the Bank of England by pointing to a
   forged bank-note.

   Morris. I hope the Professor enjoys being called a forged bank-note.

   Conjurer. Almost as much as being called the Prospectus of some
   American Companies.

   Doctor. Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

   Conjurer. I am sorry.

   Morris. Wal, let's have the argument first, then I guess we can have
   the quarrel afterwards. I'll clean this house of some encumbrances. See
   here, Mr. Smith, I'm not putting anything on your real miracle notion.
   I say, and Science says, that there's a cause for everything. Science
   will find out that cause, and sooner or later your old miracle will
   look mighty mean. Sooner or later Science will botanise a bit on your
   turnip ghosts; and make you look turnips yourselves for having taken
   any. I say....

   Doctor. [In a low voice to Smith.] I don't like this peaceful argument
   of yours. The boy is getting much too excited.

   Morris. You say old man Reynolds lived; and Science don't say no. [He
   turns excitedly to the picture.] But I guess he's dead now; and you'll
   no more raise your Saints and Prophets from the dead than you'll raise
   the Duke's great-grandfather to dance on that wall.

   [The picture begins to sway slightly to and fro on the wall.

   Doctor. Why, the picture is moving!

   Morris. [Turning furiously on the Conjurer.] You were in the room
   before us. Do you reckon that will take us in? You can do all that with
   wires.

   Conjurer. [Motionless and without looking up from the table.] Yes, I
   could do all that with wires.

   Morris. And you reckoned I shouldn't know. [Laughs with a high crowing
   laugh.] That's how the derned dirty Spiritualists do all their tricks.
   They say they can make the furniture move of itself. If it does move
   they move it; and we mean to know how.

   [A chair falls over with a slight crash.

   [Morris almost staggers and momentarily fights for breath and words.

   Morris. You ... why ... that ... every one knows that ... a sliding
   plank. It can be done with a sliding plank.

   Conjurer. [Without looking up.] Yes. It can be done with a sliding
   plank.

   [The Doctor draws nearer to Morris, who faces about, addressing him
   passionately.

   Morris. You were right on the spot, Doc, when you talked about that red
   lamp of yours. That red lamp is the light of science that will put out
   all the lanterns of your turnip ghosts. It's a consuming fire, Doctor,
   but it is the red light of the morning. [Points at it in exalted
   enthusiasm.] Your priests can no more stop that light from shining or
   change its colour and its radiance than Joshua could stop the sun and
   moon. [Laughs savagely.] Why, a real fairy in an elfin cloak strayed
   too near the lamp an hour or two ago; and it turned him into a common
   society clown with a white tie.

   [The lamp at the end of the garden turns blue. They all look at it in
   silence.

   Morris. [Splitting the silence on a high unnatural note.] Wait a bit!
   Wait a bit! I've got you! I'll have you!... [He strides wildly up and
   down the room, biting his finger.] You put a wire ... no, that can't be
   it....

   Doctor. [Speaking to him soothingly.] Well, well, just at this moment
   we need not inquire....

   Morris. [Turning on him furiously.] You call yourself a man of science,
   and you dare to tell me not to inquire!

   Smith. We only mean that for the moment you might let it alone.

   Morris. [Violently.] No, Priest, I will not let it alone. [Pacing the
   room again.] Could it be done with mirrors? [He clasps his brow.] You
   have a mirror.... [Suddenly, with a shout.] I've got it! I've got it!
   Mixture of lights! Why not? If you throw a green light on a red
   light....

   [Sudden silence.

   Smith. [Quietly to the Doctor.] You don't get blue.

   Doctor. [Stepping across to the Conjurer.] If you have done this trick,
   for God's sake undo it.

   [After a silence, the light turns red again.

   Morris. [Dashing suddenly to the glass doors and examining them.] It's
   the glass! You've been doing something to the glass!

   [He stops suddenly and there is a long silence.

   Conjurer. [Still without moving.] I don't think you will find anything
   wrong with the glass.

   Morris. [Bursting open the glass doors with a crash.] Then I'll find
   out what's wrong with the lamp.

   [Disappears into the garden.

   Doctor. It is still a wet night, I am afraid.

   Smith. Yes. And somebody else will be wandering about the garden now.

   [Through the broken glass doors Morris can be seen marching backwards
   and forwards with swifter and swifter steps.

   Smith. I suppose in this case the Celtic twilight will not get on the
   chest.

   Doctor. Oh, if it were only the chest!

   Enter Patricia.

   Patricia. Where is my brother?

   [There is an embarrassed silence, in which the Conjurer answers.

   Conjurer. I am afraid he is walking about in Fairyland.

   Patricia. But he mustn't go out on a night like this; it's very
   dangerous!

   Conjurer. Yes, it is very dangerous. He might meet a fairy.

   Patricia. What do you mean?

   Conjurer. You went out in this sort of weather and you met this sort of
   fairy, and so far it has only brought you sorrow.

   Patricia. I am going out to find my brother.

   [She goes out into the garden through the open doors.

   Smith. [After a silence, very suddenly.] What is that noise? She is not
   singing those songs to him, is she?

   Conjurer. No. He does not understand the language of the elves.

   Smith. But what are all those cries and gasps I hear?

   Conjurer. The normal noises, I believe, of a quiet business man.

   Doctor. Sir, I can understand your being bitter, for I admit you have
   been uncivilly received; but to speak like that just now....

   [Patricia reappears at the garden doors, very pale.

   Patricia. Can I speak to the Doctor?

   Doctor. My dear lady, certainly. Shall I fetch the Duke?

   Patricia. I would prefer the Doctor.

   Smith. Can I be of any use?

   Patricia. I only want the Doctor.

   [Quietly.] That last was a wonderful trick of yours.

   Smith. [Quietly.] That last was a wonderful trick of yours.

   Conjurer. Thank you. I suppose you mean it was the only one you didn't
   see through.

   Smith. Something of the kind, I confess. Your last trick was the best
   trick I have ever seen. It is so good that I wish you had not done it.

   Conjurer. And so do I.

   Smith. How do you mean? Do you wish you had never been a conjurer?

   Conjurer. I wish I had never been born.

   [Exit Conjurer.

   [A silence. The Doctor enters, very grave.

   Doctor. It is all right so far. We have brought him back.

   Smith. [Drawing near to him.] You told me there was mental trouble with
   the girl.

   Doctor. [Looking at him steadily.] No. I told you there was mental
   trouble in the family.

   Smith. [After a silence.] Where is Mr. Morris Carleon?

   Doctor. I have got him into bed in the next room. His sister is looking
   after him.

   Smith. His sister! Oh, then do you believe in fairies?

   Doctor. Believe in fairies? What do you mean?

   Smith. At least you put the person who does believe in them in charge
   of the person who doesn't.

   Doctor. Well, I suppose I do.

   Smith. You don't think she'll keep him awake all night with fairy
   tales?

   Doctor. Certainly not.

   Smith. You don't think she'll throw the medicine-bottle out of window
   and administer--er--a dewdrop, or anything of that sort? Or a
   four-leaved clover, say?

   Doctor. No; of course not.

   Smith. I only ask because you scientific men are a little hard on us
   clergymen. You don't believe in a priesthood; but you'll admit I'm more
   really a priest than this Conjurer is really a magician. You've been
   talking a lot about the Bible and the Higher Criticism. But even by the
   Higher Criticism the Bible is older than the language of the
   elves--which was, as far as I can make out, invented this afternoon.
   But Miss Carleon believed in the wizard. Miss Carleon believed in the
   language of the elves. And you put her in charge of an invalid without
   a flicker of doubt: because you trust women.

   Doctor. [Very seriously.] Yes, I trust women.

   Smith. You trust a woman with the practical issues of life and death,
   through sleepless hours when a shaking hand or an extra grain would
   kill.

   Doctor. Yes.

   Smith. But if the woman gets up to go to early service at my church,
   you call her weak-minded and say that nobody but women can believe in
   religion.

   Doctor. I should never call this woman weak-minded--no, by God, not
   even if she went to church.

   Smith. Yet there are many as strong-minded who believe passionately in
   going to church.

   Doctor. Weren't there as many who believed passionately in Apollo?

   Smith. And what harm came of believing in Apollo? And what a mass of
   harm may have come of not believing in Apollo? Does it never strike you
   that doubt can be a madness, as well be faith? That asking questions
   may be a disease, as well as proclaiming doctrines? You talk of
   religious mania! Is there no such thing as irreligious mania? Is there
   no such thing in the house at this moment?

   Doctor. Then you think no one should question at all.

   Smith. [With passion, pointing to the next room.] I think that is what
   comes of questioning! Why can't you leave the universe alone and let it
   mean what it likes? Why shouldn't the thunder be Jupiter? More men have
   made themselves silly by wondering what the devil it was if it wasn't
   Jupiter.

   Doctor. [Looking at him.] Do you believe in your own religion?

   Smith. [Returning the look equally steadily.] Suppose I don't: I should
   still be a fool to question it. The child who doubts about Santa Claus
   has insomnia. The child who believes has a good night's rest.

   Doctor. You are a Pragmatist.

   Enter Duke, absent-mindedly.

   Smith. That is what the lawyers call vulgar abuse. But I do appeal to
   practise. Here is a family over which you tell me a mental calamity
   hovers. Here is the boy who questions everything and a girl who can
   believe anything. Upon which has the curse fallen?

   Duke. Talking about the Pragmatists. I'm glad to hear.... Ah, very
   forward movement! I suppose Roosevelt now.... [Silence.] Well, we move
   you know, we move! First there was the Missing Link. [Silence.] No!
   First there was Protoplasm--and then there was the Missing Link; and
   Magna Carta and so on. [Silence.] Why, look at the Insurance Act!

   Doctor. I would rather not.

   Duke. [Wagging a playful finger at him.] Ah, prejudice, prejudice! You
   doctors, you know! Well, I never had any myself. [Silence.

   Doctor. [Breaking the silence in unusual exasperation.] Any what?

   Duke. [Firmly.] Never had any Marconis myself. Wouldn't touch 'em.
   [Silence.] Well, I must speak to Hastings.

   [Exit Duke, aimlessly.

   Doctor. [Exploding.] Well, of all the.... [Turns to Smith.] You asked
   me just now which member of the family had inherited the family
   madness.

   Smith. Yes; I did.

   Doctor. [In a low, emphatic voice.] On my living soul, I believe it
   must be the Duke.

   CURTAIN
     __________________________________________________________________

ACT III

   Room partly darkened, a table with a lamp on it, and an empty chair.
   From room next door faint and occasional sounds of the tossing or
   talking of the invalid.

   Enter Doctor Grimthorpe with a rather careworn air, and a medicine
   bottle in his hand. He puts it on the table, and sits down in the chair
   as if keeping a vigil.

   Enter Conjurer, carrying his bag, and cloaked for departure. As he
   crosses the room the Doctor rises and calls after him.

   Doctor. Forgive me, but may I detain you for one moment? I suppose you
   are aware that--[he hesitates] that there have been rather grave
   developments in the case of illness which happened after your
   performance. I would not say, of course, because of your performance.

   Conjurer. Thank you.

   Doctor. [Slightly encouraged, but speaking very carefully.]
   Nevertheless, mental excitement is necessarily an element of importance
   in physiological troubles, and your triumphs this evening were really
   so extraordinary that I cannot pretend to dismiss them from my
   patient's case. He is at present in a state somewhat analogous to
   delirium, but in which he can still partially ask and answer questions.
   The question he continually asks is how you managed to do your last
   trick.

   Conjurer. Ah! My last trick!

   Doctor. Now I was wondering whether we could make any arrangement which
   would be fair to you in the matter. Would it be possible for you to
   give me in confidence the means of satisfying this--this fixed idea he
   seems to have got. [He hesitates again, and picks his words more
   slowly.] This special condition of semi-delirious disputation is a rare
   one, and connected in my experience with rather unfortunate cases.

   Conjurer. [Looking at him steadily.] Do you mean he is going mad?

   Doctor. [Rather taken aback for the first time.] Really, you ask me an
   unfair question. I could not explain the fine shades of these things to
   a layman. And even if--if what you suggest were so, I should have to
   regard it as a professional secret.

   Conjurer. [Still looking at him.] And don't you think you ask me a
   rather unfair question, Dr. Grimthorpe? If yours is a professional
   secret, is not mine a professional secret too? If you may hide truth
   from the world, why may not I? You don't tell your tricks. I don't tell
   my tricks.

   Doctor. [With some heat.] Ours are not tricks.

   Conjurer. [Reflectively.] Ah, no one can be sure of that till the
   tricks are told.

   Doctor. But the public can see a doctor's cures as plain as....

   Conjurer. Yes. As plain as they saw the red lamp over his door this
   evening.

   Doctor. [After a pause.] Your secret, of course, would be strictly kept
   by every one involved.

   Conjurer. Oh, of course. People in delirium always keep secrets
   strictly.

   Doctor. No one sees the patient but his sister and myself.

   Conjurer. [Starts slightly.] Yes, his sister. Is she very anxious?

   Doctor. [In a lower voice.] What would you suppose?

   [Conjurer throws himself into the chair, his cloak slipping back from
   his evening dress. He ruminates for a short space and then speaks.

   Conjurer. Doctor, there are about a thousand reasons why I should not
   tell you how I really did that trick. But one will suffice, because it
   is the most practical of all.

   Doctor. Well? And why shouldn't you tell me?

   Conjurer. Because you wouldn't believe me if I did.

   [A silence, the Doctor looking at him curiously.

   [Enter the Duke with papers in his hand. His usual gaiety of manner has
   a rather forced air, owing to the fact that by some vague sick-room
   associations he walks as if on tip-toe and begins to speak in a sort of
   loud or shrill whisper. This he fortunately forgets and falls into his
   more natural voice.

   Duke. [To Conjurer.] So very kind of you to have waited, Professor. I
   expect Dr. Grimthorpe has explained the little difficulty we are in
   much better than I could. Nothing like the medical mind for a
   scientific statement. [Hazily.] Look at Ibsen.

   [Silence.

   Doctor. Of course the Professor feels considerable reluctance in the
   matter. He points out that his secrets are an essential part of his
   profession.

   Duke. Of course, of course. Tricks of the trade, eh? Very proper, of
   course. Quite a case of noblesse oblige [Silence.] But I dare say we
   shall be able to find a way out of the matter. [He turns to the
   Conjurer.] Now, my dear sir, I hope you will not be offended if I say
   that this ought to be a business matter. We are asking you for a piece
   of your professional work and knowledge, and if I may have the pleasure
   of writing you a cheque....

   Conjurer. I thank your Grace, I have already received my cheque from
   your secretary. You will find it on the counterfoil just after the
   cheque you so kindly gave to the Society for the Suppression of
   Conjuring.

   Duke. Now I don't want you to take it in that way. I want you to take
   it in a broader way. Free, you know. [With an expansive gesture.]
   Modern and all that! Wonderful man, Bernard Shaw!

   [Silence.

   Doctor. [With a slight cough, resuming.] If you feel any delicacy the
   payment need not be made merely to you. I quite respect your feelings
   in the matter.

   Duke. [Approvingly.] Quite so, quite so. Haven't you got a Cause or
   something? Everybody has a cause now, you know. Conjurers' widows or
   something of that kind.

   Conjurer. [With restraint.] No; I have no widows.

   Duke. Then something like a pension or annuity for any widows you
   may--er--procure. [Gaily opening his cheque-book and talking slang to
   show there is no ill-feeling.] Come, let me call it a couple of thou.

   [The Conjurer takes the cheque and looks at it in a grave and doubtful
   way. As he does so the Rector comes slowly into the room.

   Conjurer. You would really be willing to pay a sum like this to know
   the way I did that trick?

   Duke. I would willingly pay much more.

   Doctor. I think I explained to you that the case is serious.

   Conjurer. [More and more thoughtful.] You would pay much more....
   [Suddenly.] But suppose I tell you the secret and you find there's
   nothing in it?

   Doctor. You mean that it's really quite simple? Why, I should say that
   that would be the best thing that could possibly happen. A little
   healthy laughter is the best possible thing for convalescence.

   Conjurer. [Still looking gloomily at the cheque.] I do not think you
   will laugh.

   Duke. [Reasoning genially.] But as you say it is something quite
   simple.

   Conjurer. It is the simplest thing there is in the world. That is why
   you will not laugh.

   Doctor. [Almost nervously.] Why, what do you mean? What shall we do?

   Conjurer. [Gravely.] You will disbelieve it.

   Doctor. And why?

   Conjurer. Because it is so simple. [He springs suddenly to his feet,
   the cheque still in his hand.] You ask me how I really did the last
   trick. I will tell you how I did the last trick. I did it by magic.

   [The Duke and Doctor stare at him motionless; but the Rev. Smith starts
   and takes a step nearer the table. The Conjurer pulls his cloak round
   his shoulders. This gesture, as of departure, brings the Doctor to his
   feet.

   Doctor. [Astonished and angry.] Do you really mean that you take the
   cheque and then tell us it was only magic?

   Conjurer. [Pulling the cheque to pieces.] I tear the cheque, and I tell
   you it was only magic.

   Doctor. [With violent sincerity.] But hang it all, there's no such
   thing.

   Conjurer. Yes there is. I wish to God I did not know that there is.

   Duke. [Rising also.] Why, really, magic....

   Conjurer. [Contemptuously.] Yes, your Grace, one of those larger laws
   you were telling us about.

   [He buttons his cloak up at his throat and takes up his bag. As he does
   so the Rev. Smith steps between him and the door and stops him for a
   moment.

   Smith. [In a low voice.] One moment, sir.

   Conjurer. What do you want?

   Smith. I want to apologize to you. I mean on behalf of the company. I
   think it was wrong to offer you money. I think it was more wrong to
   mystify you with medical language and call the thing delirium. I have
   more respect for conjurer's patter than for doctor's patter. They are
   both meant to stupify; but yours only to stupify for a moment. Now I
   put it to you in plain words and on plain human Christian grounds. Here
   is a poor boy who may be going mad. Suppose you had a son in such a
   position, would you not expect people to tell you the whole truth if it
   could help you?

   Conjurer. Yes. And I have told you the whole truth. Go and find out if
   it helps you.

   [Turns again to go, but more irresolutely.

   Smith. You know quite well it will not help us.

   Conjurer. Why not?

   Smith. You know quite well why not. You are an honest man; and you have
   said it yourself. Because he would not believe it.

   Conjurer. [With a sort of fury.] Well, does anybody believe it? Do you
   believe it?

   Smith. [With great restraint.] Your question is quite fair. Come, let
   us sit down and talk about it. Let me take your cloak.

   Conjurer. I will take off my cloak when you take off your coat.

   Smith. [Smiling.] Why? Do you want me to fight?

   Conjurer. [Violently.] I want you to be martyred. I want you to bear
   witness to your own creed. I say these things are supernatural. I say
   this was done by a spirit. The Doctor does not believe me. He is an
   agnostic; and he knows everything. The Duke does not believe me; he
   cannot believe anything so plain as a miracle. But what the devil are
   you for, if you don't believe in a miracle? What does your coat mean,
   if it doesn't mean that there is such a thing as the supernatural? What
   does your cursed collar mean if it doesn't mean that there is such a
   thing as a spirit? [Exasperated.] Why the devil do you dress up like
   that if you don't believe in it? [With violence.] Or perhaps you don't
   believe in devils?

   Smith. I believe.... [After a pause.] I wish I could believe.

   Conjurer. Yes. I wish I could disbelieve.

   [Enter Patricia pale and in the slight négligée of the amateur nurse.

   Patricia. May I speak to the Conjurer?

   Smith. [Hastening forward.] You want the Doctor?

   Patricia. No, the Conjurer.

   Doctor. Are there any developments?

   Patricia. I only want to speak to the Conjurer.

   [They all withdraw, either at the garden or the other doors. Patricia
   walks up to Conjurer.

   Patricia. You must tell me how you did the trick. You will. I know you
   will. O, I know my poor brother was rude to you. He's rude to
   everybody! [Breaks down.] But he's such a little, little boy!

   Conjurer. I suppose you know there are things men never tell to women.
   They are too horrible.

   Patricia. Yes. And there are things women never tell to men. They also
   are too horrible. I am here to hear them all.

   Conjurer. Do you really mean I may say anything I like? However dark it
   is? However dreadful it is? However damnable it is?

   Patricia. I have gone through too much to be terrified now. Tell me the
   very worst.

   Conjurer. I will tell you the very worst. I fell in love with you when
   I first saw you.

   [Sits down and crosses his legs.

   Patricia. [Drawing back.] You told me I looked like a child and....

   Conjurer. I told a lie.

   Patricia. O; this is terrible.

   Conjurer. I was in love, I took an opportunity. You believed quite
   simply that I was a magician? but I....

   Patricia. It is terrible. It is terrible. I never believed you were a
   magician.

   Conjurer. [Astounded.] Never believed I was a magician...!

   Patricia. I always knew you were a man.

   Conjurer. [Doing whatever passionate things people do on the stage.] I
   am a man. And you are a woman. And all the elves have gone to elfland,
   and all the devils to hell. And you and I will walk out of this great
   vulgar house and be married.... Every one is crazy in this house
   to-night, I think. What am I saying? As if you could marry me! O my
   God!

   Patricia. This is the first time you have failed in courage.

   Conjurer. What do you mean?

   Patricia. I mean to draw your attention to the fact that you have
   recently made an offer, I accept it.

   Conjurer. Oh, it's nonsense, it's nonsense. How can a man marry an
   archangel, let alone a lady. My mother was a lady and she married a
   dying fiddler who tramped the roads; and the mixture plays the cat and
   banjo with my body and soul. I can see my mother now cooking food in
   dirtier and dirtier lodgings, darning socks with weaker and weaker eyes
   when she might have worn pearls by consenting to be a rational person.

   Patricia. And she might have grown pearls, by consenting to be an
   oyster.

   Conjurer. [Seriously.] There was little pleasure in her life.

   Patricia. There is little, a very little, in everybody's. The question
   is, what kind? We can't turn life into a pleasure. But we can choose
   such pleasures as are worthy of us and our immortal souls. Your mother
   chose and I have chosen.

   Conjurer. [Staring.] Immortal souls!... And I suppose if I knelt down
   to worship you, you and every one else would laugh.

   Patricia. [With a smile of perversity.] Well, I think this is a more
   comfortable way. [She sits down suddenly beside him in a sort of
   domestic way and goes on talking.] Yes. I'll do everything your mother
   did, not so well, of course; I'll darn that conjurer's hat--does one
   darn hats?--and cook the Conjurer's dinner. By the way, what is a
   Conjurer's dinner? There's always the goldfish, of course....

   Conjurer. [With a groan.] Carrots.

   Patricia. And, of course, now I come to think of it, you can always
   take rabbits out of the hat. Why, what a cheap life it must be! How do
   you cook rabbits? The Duke is always talking about poached rabbits.
   Really, we shall be as happy as is good for us. We'll have confidence
   in each other at least, and no secrets. I insist on knowing all the
   tricks.

   Conjurer. I don't think I know whether I'm on my head or my heels.

   Patricia. And now, as we're going to be so confidential and
   comfortable, you'll just tell me the real, practical, tricky little way
   you did that last trick.

   Conjurer. [Rising, rigid with horror.] How I did that trick? I did it
   by devils. [Turning furiously on Patricia.] You could believe in
   fairies. Can't you believe in devils?

   Patricia. [Seriously.] No, I can't believe in devils.

   Conjurer. Well, this room is full of them.

   Patricia. What does it all mean?

   Conjurer. It only means that I have done what many men have done; but
   few, I think, have thriven by. [He sits down and talks thoughtfully.] I
   told you I had mixed with many queer sets of people. Among others, I
   mixed with those who pretend, truly and falsely, to do our tricks by
   the aid of spirits. I dabbled a little in table-rapping and
   table-turning. But I soon had reason to give it up.

   Patricia. Why did you give it up?

   Conjurer. It began by giving me headaches. And I found that every
   morning after a Spiritualist séance I had a queer feeling of lowness
   and degradation, of having been soiled; much like the feeling, I
   suppose, that people have the morning after they have been drunk. But I
   happen to have what people call a strong head; and I have never been
   really drunk.

   Patricia. I am glad of that.

   Conjurer. It hasn't been for want of trying. But it wasn't long before
   the spirits with whom I had been playing at table-turning, did what I
   think they generally do at the end of all such table-turning.

   Patricia. What did they do?

   Conjurer. They turned the tables. They turned the tables upon me. I
   don't wonder at your believing in fairies. As long as these things were
   my servants they seemed to me like fairies. When they tried to be my
   masters.... I found they were not fairies. I found the spirits with
   whom I at least had come in contact were evil ... awfully, unnaturally
   evil.

   Patricia. Did they say so?

   Conjurer. Don't talk of what they said. I was a loose fellow, but I had
   not fallen so low as such things. I resisted them; and after a pretty
   bad time, psychologically speaking, I cut the connexion. But they were
   always tempting me to use the supernatural power I had got from them.
   It was not very great, but it was enough to move things about, to alter
   lights, and so on. I don't know whether you realize that it's rather a
   strain on a man to drink bad coffee at a coffee-stall when he knows he
   has just enough magic in him to make a bottle of champagne walk out of
   an empty shop.

   Patricia. I think you behaved very well.

   Conjurer. [Bitterly.] And when I fell at last it was for nothing half
   so clean and Christian as champagne. In black blind pride and anger and
   all kinds of heathenry, because of the impudence of a schoolboy, I
   called on the fiends and they obeyed.

   Patricia. [Touches his arm.] Poor fellow!

   Conjurer. Your goodness is the only goodness that never goes wrong.

   Patricia. And what are we to do with Morris? I--I believe you now, my
   dear. But he--he will never believe.

   Conjurer. There is no bigot like the atheist. I must think.

   [Walks towards the garden windows. The other men reappear to arrest his
   movement.

   Doctor. Where are you going?

   Conjurer. I am going to ask the God whose enemies I have served if I am
   still worthy to save a child.

   [Exit into garden. He paces up and down exactly as Morris has done. As
   he does so, Patricia slowly goes out; and a long silence follows,
   during which the remaining men stir and stamp very restlessly. The
   darkness increases. It is long before anyone speaks.

   Doctor. [Abruptly.] Remarkable man that Conjurer. Clever man. Curious
   man. Very curious man. A kind of man, you know.... Lord bless us!
   What's that?

   Duke. What's what, eh? What's what?

   Doctor. I swear I heard a footstep.

   Enter Hastings with papers.

   Duke. Why, Hastings--Hastings--we thought you were a ghost. You must
   be--er--looking white or something.

   Hastings. I have brought back the answer of the Anti-Vegetarians ... I
   mean the Vegetarians.

   [Drops one or two papers.

   Duke. Why, Hastings, you are looking white.

   Hastings. I ask your Grace's pardon. I had a slight shock on entering
   the room.

   Doctor. A shock? What shock?

   Hastings. It is the first time, I think, that your Grace's work has
   been disturbed by any private feelings of mine. I shall not trouble
   your Grace with them. It will not occur again.

   [Exit Hastings.

   Duke. What an extraordinary fellow. I wonder if....

   [Suddenly stops speaking.

   Doctor. [After a long silence, in a low voice to Smith.] How do you
   feel?

   Smith. I feel I must have a window shut or I must have it open, and I
   don't know which it is.

   [Another long silence.

   Smith. [Crying out suddenly in the dark.] In God's name, go!

   Doctor. [Jumping up rather in a tremble.] Really, sir, I am not used to
   being spoken to....

   Smith. It was not you whom I told to go.

   Doctor. No. [Pause.] But I think I will go. This room is simply
   horrible.

   [He marches towards the door.

   Duke. [Jumping up and bustling about, altering cards, papers, etc., on
   tables.] Room horrible? Room horrible? No, no, no. [Begins to run
   quicker round the room, flapping his hands like fins.] Only a little
   crowded. A little crowded. And I don't seem to know all the people. We
   can't like everybody. These large at-homes....

   [Tumbles on to a chair.

   Conjurer. [Reappearing at the garden doors.] Go back to hell from which
   I called you. It is the last order I shall give.

   Doctor. [Rising rather shakily.] And what are you going to do?

   Conjurer. I am going to tell that poor little lad a lie. I have found
   in the garden what he did not find in the garden. I have managed to
   think of a natural explanation of that trick.

   Doctor. [Warmly moved.] I think you are something like a great man. Can
   I take your explanation to him now?

   Conjurer. [Grimly.] No thank you. I will take it myself.

   [Exit into the other room.

   Duke. [Uneasily.] We all felt devilish queer just now. Wonderful things
   there are in the world. [After a pause.] I suppose it's all
   electricity.

   [Silence as usual.

   Smith. I think there has been more than electricity in all this.

   Enter Patricia, still pale, but radiant.

   Patricia. Oh, Morris is ever so much better! The Conjurer has told him
   such a good story of how the trick was done.

   Enter Conjurer.

   Duke. Professor, we owe you a thousand thanks!

   Doctor. Really, you have doubled your claim to originality!

   Smith. It is much more marvellous to explain a miracle than to work a
   miracle. What was your explanation, by the way?

   Conjurer. I shall not tell you.

   Smith. [Starting.] Indeed? Why not?

   Conjurer. Because God and the demons and that Immortal Mystery that you
   deny has been in this room to-night. Because you know it has been here.
   Because you have felt it here. Because you know the spirits as well as
   I do and fear them as much as I do.

   Smith. Well?

   Conjurer. Because all this would not avail. If I told you the lie I
   told Morris Carleon about how I did that trick....

   Smith. Well?

   Conjurer. You would believe it as he believed it. You cannot think
   [pointing to the lamp] how that trick could be done naturally. I alone
   found out how it could be done--after I had done it by magic. But if I
   tell you a natural way of doing it....

   Smith. Well?...

   Conjurer. Half an hour after I have left this house you will be all
   saying how it was done.

   [Conjurer buttons up his cloak and advances to Patricia.

   Conjurer. Good-bye.

   Patricia. I shall not say good-bye.

   Conjurer. You are great as well as good. But a saint can be a temptress
   as well as a sinner. I put my honour in your hands ... oh, yes, I have
   a little left. We began with a fairy tale. Have I any right to take
   advantage of that fairy tale? Has not that fairy tale really and truly
   come to an end?

   Patricia. Yes. That fairy tale has really and truly come to an end.
   [Looks at him a little in the old mystical manner.] It is very hard for
   a fairy tale to come to an end. If you leave it alone it lingers
   everlastingly. Our fairy tale has come to an end in the only way a
   fairy tale can come to an end. The only way a fairy tale can leave off
   being a fairy tale.

   Conjurer. I don't understand you.

   Patricia. It has come true.

   CURTAIN
