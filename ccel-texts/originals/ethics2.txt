NOTE OF TRANSLATOR.

   THIS second volume contains the first of the three forms under which
   Dr. Wuttke treats of the subject-matter of Christian Ethics. It
   embraces and occupies the entire ethical field. Its aim is to treat
   each phase and bearing of the moral life from a normal or ideal
   stand-point; in other words, to present the moral life as God
   originally willed, and yet wills, that it should be. It involves in its
   scope, therefore, all the essential principles of the system of the
   author, and constitutes a whole in and of itself.

   As to the scientific character of the work, and as to whether it
   answers wants which are but very imperfectly met by any of our present
   English treatises; in a word, as to whether the work of Dr. Wuttke
   finds before it, in the English-reading world, a comparatively
   unoccupied and yet very important field, I beg leave to refer the
   reader chiefly and ultimately to the work itself, but also,
   preliminarily, to the special introduction to this volume, for which I
   am thankfully indebted to Dr. W. F. Warren, of the Boston University.
   Frank and earnest words like these from this distinguished scholar and
   theologian will, I am sure, not fail to arrest the attention of whoever
   thirsts after clear and truly Christian views on the great problems of
   human life.

INTRODUCTION.

   No literature is richer in native productions in the field of Ethics
   than the English. It probably presents more original, representative
   systems of moral philosophy than any other. This at least would seem to
   be the verdict of a distinguished French philosopher, and French
   philosophers are not often afflicted with "anglomania" in any amiable
   sense. In the nineteenth Lecture of his Introduction to Ethics,
   Jouffroy pays this high tribute to his neighbors across the channel:
   "How has it happened, you may ask, that all these moral systems, which
   we have been considering, were of English origin? The explanation of
   the fact is this very simple one, that moral philosophy, properly so
   called, has been infinitely more cultivated in England during the
   seventeenth and eighteenth centuries than in any other part of Europe.
   In France, for example, the Cartesian era produced only one eminent
   moralist, Malebranche; and Malebranche belonged neither to the class of
   selfish philosophers, nor to that of the sentimental philosophers.
   Cartesianism was followed in France, in the middle of the eighteenth
   century, by a new philosophy, but this was the system of materialism in
   metaphysics and of selfishness in morals; and called to choose between
   Helvetius and Hobbes, I could not but prefer Hobbes. Much the same
   might be said of the philosophy of Germany, which has always been more
   metaphysical than moral, and has never exhibited any forms of the
   selfish or instinctive systems, which have obtained such a European
   celebrity as those of Hobbes, of Smith, and of Hume." That this
   fertility of Anglo-Saxon mind in the department of ethical speculation
   was not limited to the centuries named, is clear from the bulk of our
   more recent ethical literature. Its full stream has never subsided, and
   is to-day pouring on past Bain and Barratt, in England, past Hickok and
   Hopkins in America.

   But while this department of our literature is almost immeasurable, and
   certainly invaluable, it is sadly deficient in works written from a
   distinctively Christian stand-point. One large portion of our treatises
   are purely philosophical. Another, perhaps still larger, wretchedly
   confuse and mix up the ethics of philosophy with the ethics of
   revelation. Scarce one author has attempted to present in an
   independent scientific form the whole ethical system of Christianity.
   It is much as if we had innumerable treatises on what is called natural
   theology, but as yet not one on the doctrines of the Christian
   Revelation. Didactic theologians have occasionally included in their
   Bodies of Divinity a brief account of the "Morals of Christianity," but
   thus far no one has yet done for Christian Ethics in our literature,
   what Danaeus and Calixtus did for it in the Reformed and Lutheran
   Churches of continental Europe. The Science of Christian Ethics is with
   us almost unknown. Too many of our least suspected manuals, written by
   honored and able evangelical divines, presuppose and continually imply
   a Socinian anthropology, and a worse than Romish soteriology. [1]

   Whatever may be the true explanation of this grave deficiency, it
   certainly is not due to an oversight of the essential difference
   between philosophical and Christian Ethics. Not a few of our
   evangelical writers have pointed out the incompleteness and
   comparatively imperfect basis of the former; but, with the exception of
   Wardlaw, scarce one has done any thing to supplant or to supplement it.
   John Foster, in the Fourth of his "Essays," has some excellent thoughts
   on the impossibility of ignoring such revealed facts as Human
   Depravity, Redemption, the Mission of the Spirit, Immortality, and
   Future Judgment, in any comprehensive and thorough presentation of the
   system of Human Duty. Richard Watson enumerates five grave mischiefs,
   which result from the attempt "to teach morals independently of
   Christianity." The writer of the essay on the Science of Christian
   Ethics in the work, "Science and the Gospel," (London, 1870,) a writer
   who acknowledges his great obligation to the lucid and admirable
   Wuttke," calling him "one of the most deservedly distinguished
   ethicists of modern times," "a Christian ethicist of superlative
   merit," expresses this sentiment: "The propriety of discussing moral
   questions apart from their natural and immediate implication with
   Christian Truth, admits of the gravest doubts." Wardlaw goes even.
   further and asserts that, "The science of morals has no province at all
   independently of theology, and it cannot be philosophically discussed
   except upon theological principles." Watson's final definition of the
   relation of the two systems or methods is less extreme than this, and
   accords very nearly with that given by Wuttke in section fourth of his
   Introduction. [2]

   But whatever may be thought of philosophical ethics, or of the exact
   relation of the two branches to each other, no believer in Christian
   Revelation can for a moment call in question the legitimacy of
   specifically Christian Ethics. No Christian believer can possibly speak
   his whole mind respecting man, the ethical subject, or God, the author
   of our ethical relations, or our destiny, the result of our ethical
   action, without stating or implying all the fundamental doctrines of
   Christianity. Indeed, no man can elaborate any ethical system of any
   considerable completeness without definite and most important
   theological implications. As a matter of fact, most of our accepted
   text-books are thoroughly Deistic. They give us not the Morals of
   Christianity, or of Judaism, or of heathenism, but simply the ethical
   system of Lord Herbert, or Theodore Parker. We are glad to possess
   them, glad to see just what ethical consequence Deism carries with it;
   nevertheless we must repudiate their claims to an exclusive occupancy
   of the field, and especially their claims to represent the ethics of
   Revelation. Their use in Christian schools is at least of very doubtful
   expediency. Let every theological system, even those of the heathen,
   develop its supplementary ethical system, only let it not attempt to
   palm off its own ethical implication for those of wholly different
   systems.

   The value of any elaborate system of ethics is largely in proportion to
   its fidelity to the theological views and principles of its author. If
   we study an atheistic system, we desire to ascertain precisely what the
   logical results of atheism are in the field of morals. This is the only
   special benefit we can hope to gain from the study. So a modern Jewish,
   Mohammedan, or ethnic system is valuable in proportion as it gives us
   the true ethical results of the particular religion from which it
   springs. Thorough ethical treatises are, therefore, to be welcomed from
   whatever theological stand-point they may be written. If thorough, they
   will serve the cause of truth. In the way of reductio ad absurdum they
   will often evince the untenableness of the theological principles upon
   which they rest. So far as they spring from correct theological
   conceptions, they will mutually complement and confirm each other.

   The same thing may be said of systems of Christian ethics written from
   different confessional stand-points. Their value, too, is usually in
   proportion to their logical consistency. One of their most important
   uses is to throw light upon the necessary ethical consequences of their
   respective types of doctrine. In this respect the most strictly
   confessional are the most useful. In the interest of universal
   Christian theology, therefore, we greatly desiderate a thorough and
   active confessional cultivation of this field. The more clearly and
   constantly conscious of his distinctive doctrinal stand-point, the
   better service the author will render. Nothing is gained, much lost, by
   mixing up essentially Romish and essentially Protestant definitions. In
   like manner Augustinian ethics are as eternally distinct from Pelagian
   as are the theological systems so named. If Methodist theology be true,
   no consistent Calvinist can ever write a system of ethics acceptable to
   a Methodist, and vice versa. Romanism, Calvinism, Lutheranism and
   Methodism as much need distinctive treatises upon ethics as upon
   Christian doctrine. Each has the same right to the one as to the other.
   Nor will they thus aggravate and prolong the dissensions and divisions
   of the universal Church; they will rather accelerate the coining of the
   day when each great branch of Christendom will have matured its
   distinctive thought and perfected its distinctive life, preparatory to
   a higher and grander synthesis. Even before that day comes, each type
   of ethical inculcation will have its essential and characteristic
   excellences, and so effectively supplement all other types.

   Especially welcome to the English reader must be a thorough scientific
   presentation of Christian ethics from the Lutheran stand-point.
   Hitherto none has been accessible. The whole theological literature of
   Lutheranism in the English language is deplorably meager. Considering
   the historic interest and present relations of this great Church of the
   Reformation, the deficiency is almost inexplicable. In this country the
   actual numerical proportions of the communion, its rapid growth from
   immigration, the close affinities of its best theology and best life
   with the dominant theology and life of the country, conspire to render
   its teachings and spirit a study of great interest to every intelligent
   American believer. Nor can the unedifying controversies and schisms
   which have hitherto so excessively characterized the body, or even the
   high-churchly self-complacency of such representatives as the author of
   "The Conservative Reformation and its Theology." effectually prevent
   the Christians of neighboring folds from cherishing a growing interest
   in their ecclesiastical life, and in that of their confessional and
   ethnological kindred in the Fatherland.

   An English translation of Wuttke's great work on "Christian Ethics"
   ought, therefore, to be warmly welcomed on many accounts. First, for
   all the excellent reasons suggested by Dr. Riehm, at the close of his
   special preface to Volume I of this translation.

   Second, because as a work on Christian Ethics it will contribute to the
   supply of what is perhaps the gravest and most unaccountable lack in
   the whole range of English theological literature.

   Third, because it will have a tendency to stimulate American and
   English moralists to a cultivation of their science from evangelical,
   and possibly from strictly confessional, stand-points.

   Fourth, because by means of it the English student will now, for the
   first time, have an opportunity to see in full scientific form the
   ethical implications and inculcations of modern evangelical
   Lutheranism.

   For all these reasons, it affords the writer unfeigned pleasure to bid
   the new-clad work God-speed, and to commend it to the faithful study of
   all lovers of Christian truth and holiness.

    SECTION L.

   THEOLOGICAL Christian ethics, as distinguished from philosophical
   ethics, has an historical presupposition--the redemption accomplished
   in Christ. But redemption presupposes sin, from the power of which it
   delivers man; and sin presupposes the moral idea per se, of which it is
   the actual negation. Hence the knowledge of Christian ethics, as
   resting on the accomplished redemption, presupposes a knowledge of the
   moral state of man while as yet unredeemed, as in turn this knowledge
   presupposes a knowledge of that ideal state of being from which man
   turned aside in sin. Christian ethics has therefore a threefold state
   of things to present:

   (1) The ethical or moral per se irrespectively of sin,--the moral in
   its ideal form, the proto-ethical, that which God, as holy, wills.

   (2) The fall from the truly moral, namely, sin, or the guilty
   perversion of the moral idea in the actual world,--that which man, as
   unholy, wills.

   (3) The moral in its restoration by redemption, that is, the
   regeneration of moral truth out of sinful corruption,--that which is
   willed by God as gracious, and by man as repentant.

   These three forms of the moral or ethical stand, in relation to
   humanity, not beside but before and after each other,--constitute a
   moral history of humanity: the first stage is pre-historical; the
   second is the substance of the history of humanity up to Christ; the
   third is the substance of that stream of history which proceeds from
   Christ and is embodied in, and carried forward by, those who belong to
   Christ.

   As in Christianity all religious and moral life stands in relation to
   the redemption accomplished in Christ, that is, to an historical fact,
   hence Christian ethics must also, under one of its phases, bear an
   historical character. Man is Christianly-moral only in so far as he is
   conscious of being redeemed by Christ; hence in this Christianly-moral
   consciousness the above-stated three thoughts are directly involved.
   Only that one can know himself as redeemed who knows himself as sinful
   without redemption; and only he can know himself as sinful who has a
   consciousness of the moral ideal. The classification of ethics here
   presented is based therefore in the essence of Christian morality
   itself. The first division presents ideal morality as unaffected as yet
   by the reality of sin,--morality in the state of innocence; the second
   presents the actual morality of man as natural and
   spiritually-fallen,--morality in the state of sin; the third presents
   the Christian morality of man as rescued from sin by regeneration, and
   reconciled to and united with God,--morality in the state of grace. The
   first part is predominantly a steadily-progressive unfolding of the
   moral idea per se; the second belongs predominantly to historical
   experience; while the third, as a reconciling of reality with the
   ideal, belongs at the same time to both fields. The historical person
   of Christ is, for all three spheres of the moral, a revelation of the
   truth that is to be embraced; in relation to ideal morality Christ is
   the pure moral prototype per se--the historical realization of the
   moral idea; in relation to the moral state in the second sphere, he
   manifests the antagonism of sin to moral truth, in the hatred of which
   he is the object; in relation to the third sphere, he is the
   essentially founding and co-working power, and manifests the antagonism
   of holiness to sin.

   To present distinctively-Christian morality alone would be
   scientifically defective, as, without the two antecedent forms of the
   moral, it cannot be properly understood. To present ideal morality
   alone is the task of purely philosophical ethics,--usually, however,
   instead of the proposed pretendedly ideal ethics, the result is simply
   an artfully disguised justification of the natural sinful nature of
   unredeemed man. The ideal morality of our first division is in itself
   fully sufficient only for such as do not admit an antagonism between
   the actual state of humanity and the requirements of the moral idea, or
   who explain it into a mere remaining-behind the subsequently
   to-be-attained perfection, instead of conceiving of it as an
   essentially perverted state. The fundamental thought of Christian
   morality is this, namely, that the natural man is not simply normally
   imperfect, but that he is, guiltily, in an essential antagonism to the
   truly good, and that he is in need of a thorough spiritual renewing or
   regeneration. That this is the case is not to be proved à priori, not
   to be developed scientifically, but to be recognized as a fact. With
   the reality of sin the moral life becomes essentially changed, and an
   ethical treatise which should make reference to sin only as a mere
   possibility, as is the case with purely philosophical ethics, would,
   for this reason, be insufficient for the actual state of humanity. The
   history of humanity has become in all respects other than it would have
   been without sin, and hence a complete system of ethics cannot have
   merely a purely philosophical, but must have also an historical
   character,--must grapple with the entire and dread earnestness of real
   sin. If it ended at this stage, however, it would present but a dismal
   panorama of woe, utterly unrelieved by a gleam of comfort. But divine
   love has interrupted the history of sin by an historical
   redemption-act, and founded a history of salvation inside of
   humanity,--has given to man the possibility and the power to overcome
   sin in himself, and to rise up from his God-estrangement toward the
   moral goal. This is the third sphere, that of distinctively Christian
   morality, which, while it has indeed its prototype in the ideal
   ante-sinful form of morality, is nevertheless not identical therewith,
   inasmuch as its actual presuppositions and conditions are entirely
   different,--namely, no longer a per se pure, and spiritually and
   morally vigorous, subject, and no longer a per se good, and, for all
   moral influences, open and receptive, objective world, but, on the
   contrary, in both cases an obstinate resistance; it is in both respects
   therefore a morality of incessant struggle, while that of our first
   division is rather the morality of a simple development;--it is also
   not a mere pressing forward out of an, as yet, incomplete and in so
   far, imperfect state, but a real overcoming of actual immoral powers;
   and the earnestness of the morality, as well as of the ethical system,
   rises in proportion as we more deeply comprehend the inner and
   essential difference between the above-given three divisions of the
   subject-matter of ethics, as well as at the same time their inner and
   historical connection.

   This our distribution of the subject-matter of ethics, though
   manifestly very accordant with the Christian consciousness, has been
   assailed on many sides; and especially have some writers manifested
   great concern as to whence in fact we could have any knowledge of this
   ideal and strictly-speaking non-realized morality. Such an objection
   ought at least not to be urged by those who think themselves able to
   construct a system, even of Christian ethics, upon the mere facts of
   the consciousness, or indeed upon a basis purely speculative. But
   certainly all who conceive of sin as a something absolutely necessary,
   will of course have to regard our first division as a pure product of a
   dreamy imagination; we contest, however, to writers holding such an
   opinion; the right to deny to a system of Christian ethics--which is
   throughout inspired with the thought that sin is the ruin of men [Prov.
   xiv, 34] and an abomination to the Lord [xv, 9]--the privilege of
   treating upon and discussing that which God, as holy, requires of his
   good-created children. As to whether for such discussion we have also a
   source of knowledge, will appear as we proceed.

I. NOTION AND ESSENCE OF THE MORAL.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LI. The Good.

   THE moral idea rests upon that of purpose or end. An end is an idea to
   be realized by a life-movement. Whatever answers to an idea is good
   relatively to that idea. Whatever answers to, and perfectly realizes, a
   rational, and hence also a divine, idea, is good absolutely. All divine
   life and activity has a divine purpose; whatever God brings to
   realization is therefore absolutely good,--is in perfect harmony with
   the divine will.--A nature-object is good per se and directly, in
   virtue of the creative act itself; and whatever is implied in it, as an
   end to be attained to by development, is actually realized in fact by
   an inner divinely-willed necessity. The essence of a rational creature
   is per se likewise good; but its full realization as that of a truly
   rational being, that is, its rational end, is not directly forced upon
   it by natural necessity, but is proposed to it as to be realized by its
   own rational, and hence free, activity. The goodness of a merely
   natural being lies in the necessarily self-fulfilling purpose of God in
   the creature; that of a rational creature lies in the free,
   self-fulfilling, through it, of the will of God to the creature. The
   divine will is, in the latter case, not merely an end for God, it is
   also a conscious end for the rational creature. The good in general, in
   so far as it is a conscious end for a rational creature, is a
   (concrete) good. In as far as this good is unitary and perfect, and
   hence perfectly answering to the divine will as to the creature, it is
   the highest good,--which consequently must also be absolutely one and,
   for all rational creatures, essentially the same, namely, their fully
   attained rational perfection. Hence all rational development of a
   rational creature aims at the realization of the highest good.

   As far back as in ancient Greece, philosophers have engaged in the
   discussion of the notion of the good, and of the highest good, and have
   proposed various definitions thereof,--those of Aristotle being in the
   main correct. In and of itself the question is quite simple; it becomes
   difficult only when we look upon the actual condition of man without
   fully taking into account the antagonism of his reality with his ideal,
   and are for that reason unable clearly to distinguish in human
   aspirations the abnormal from the normal. As to the notion of the
   relatively good, there is no dispute; it is always the. agreement of a
   reality with an idea or with another reality, and hence is based on the
   thought of a mutual congruity of the manifold.--The simple and true
   notion of the good is indicated in Gen. i, 3, 4, 31; [comp. 1 Tim. iv,
   4]. God speaks and it comes to pass; the reality is the perfect
   expression of the divine thought and will, and hence, of its own ideal.
   We have here the notion, not merely of the relatively good, but of the
   absolutely good; relatively good is every harmonizing or congruence of
   the different; absolutely good is a harmonizing with God. Hence, first
   of all, God himself is good and the prototype of all good [Psa. xxv, 8;
   lxxxvi, 5; Matt. xix, 17],--good relatively to himself, as being in
   perfect harmony with himself,--good relatively to his creatures, in
   that He sustains them in the form of life which He gave them, that is,
   in their true peculiarities and autonomy, and constantly manifests
   himself to them as their loving God and Father [Psa. xxxiv, 9]. A
   creature is good in so far as it is an image of God,--namely, such a
   revelation of the divine as is conditioned by the normal peculiarity of
   the creature,--and, from another point of view, in so far as its actual
   state is in harmony with its essence, its ideal, and hence also (since
   all creatures are created for each other) with the totality of
   creation. Every thing that God created was "very good" also in this
   respect, namely, that the different creatures constituted among
   themselves a perfectly concordant and harmonious whole; "it was not
   good that the man should be alone," seeing that a finite creature is,
   in its very essence, not a mere isolated individual, but should
   constitute a member of a community. Hence the expression tvv has also
   the signification of kalos, gratus, jucundus, suavis; we attribute this
   quality to an object as bearing upon ourselves in so far as it
   harmonizes with and reflects our own peculiarities,--in so far as we
   feel an affinity for it and are enriched and furthered by it in our
   life-sphere and activity. Hence, that is truly good for man which
   contributes to the attainment of his true, divinely-intended
   perfection, and hence, in the last instance, this perfection itself.
   Now, a mere nature-object possesses the good within itself as a
   necessary law, and cannot but realize it; but a rational creature has
   it within itself as a rational consciousness, as a free law, as a
   command, and it may decline to realize it. In a nature-object the end
   fulfills itself; in a rational creature it is fulfilled only by the
   free will of the same. Nature-objects are, in and of themselves, an
   image of God; but man was created not only in accordance with the image
   of God, but also unto it,--has this image before him as a goal to be
   attained to by free action, as a rational task.

   Whatever is good is good for some object, and is for the same, in so
   far as actually appropriated by it, a good. That only can be a true
   good which is good absolutely, that is, divine; all true goods are
   front God [James i, 17], and lead to God. The idea of the highest good
   we propose here to determine, preliminarily, not as to its contents,
   but simply as to its form. It cannot belong exclusively to any one
   phase of man's being, but must consist in the symmetrical completion of
   his life as a whole; hence it cannot be simply the perfection of his
   isolated individuality as such, but only as a living member of the
   living whole. Nor is the highest good a merely relatively higher among
   many other less high goods, otherwise the sum total of the former
   together with these latter would amount to something higher still; on
   the contrary all goods collectively, as far as they are really such,
   must be single elements of the highest good; and the simple fact that a
   particular object which I desire, and which hence seems to me as a
   good, is adapted to be a manifestation or an element of the highest
   good, is clear proof that it is a real, and not a merely seeming, good.
   Whatever a man aims after appears to him as a good; whatever he shuns,
   as an evil; and rationality consists in the fact that he aim not at the
   seemingly, but at the really, good, and, in each single good, at the
   highest good; and this aiming is itself good. The highest good is,
   consequently, the highest perfection of the rational personality, or
   the perfect development of God-likeness, or, in other words, the
   perfect agreement of the actual state of man's entire being and life
   with his ideal, that is, with the will of God,--which all are, in fact,
   only so many different expressions for the same thing. Whatever
   contributes to this highest end is good; whatever leads from it is
   evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LII. The Moral.

   In so far as a rational creature realizes the good rationally, that is,
   with a consciousness of the good end, and with a free will, it is
   moral. The moral is the good in so far as it is realized by the free
   will of a rational creature; and. in this manifestation of rational
   life, both the will, and also the action and the end, are moral; and
   true morality consists in the complete harmony of these three elements.
   Morality is therefore the life of a rational being who accomplishes the
   good with conscious freedom, and, hence, works the harmony of
   existence,--as well the harmony of its own being with God as also (and
   in fact thereby) the harmony of the being in and with itself and with
   all other beings, in so far as they themselves are in harmony with God.
   Morality, therefore, embraces within itself two phases of rational
   life: on the one hand, it preserves and develops the normal autonomy
   and peculiarity of the moral subject,--does not let it vanish into, or
   be absorbed by, God or the All,--for there is harmony only where there
   is a distinctness and individuality of the objects compared; on the
   other hand, it does not permit this difference to become an antagonism
   or contradiction, but preserves it in unity,--shapes it into rational
   harmony. The moral is therefore the beautiful in the sphere of rational
   freedom,--is rationally self-manifesting freedom itself. To be rational
   and to be moral is, in the sphere of freedom, one and the same thing.

   Moralness bears the same relation to the goodness of mere
   nature-objects, as conscious freedom to unconscious necessity. The
   goodness of creatures is not their mere being, but their life, for God
   whose image they are, is life; God is not a God of the dead but of the
   living. Hence the goodness of rational creatures is essentially life
   also, and in this life morality realizes the good. With this view of
   morality we may properly enough speak also of a morality of God; the
   fact that human morality is really a progressive development of the
   image of God, even presupposes this; moreover the Scriptures positively
   express this thought, and there is no good ground for explaining it
   away. God is good [tvv] and upright; [ysr; Deut. xxxii, 4; Psa. xxv,
   8]; hence our German hymn: "O God, thou upright God!") is strictly
   Biblical. God, as the absolutely holy will, is perfect morality itself,
   inasmuch as his entire being and activity are in perfect accord with
   his will and essence, and inasmuch as his infinite justice and love
   establish and uphold the harmony of life in the created universe. God's
   morality is his holiness. For this reason God is also the perfect
   prototype and pattern of all morality; "ye shall therefore be holy, for
   I am holy" [Lev. xi, 45]; also virtue, arete, in the strict sense of
   the word, is attributed to God [1 Pet. ii, 9; 2 Pet. i, 3]. Hence, man
   is moral not merely in general, in that he makes God's will the law of
   his life, but more specifically, in that he makes God's morality his
   pattern. In God all good is also moral or holy; in the creature; all
   that is moral is also good, but all that is good is not also moral.

   Rothe objects to the more common notion of the moral, because it
   embraces only the idea of the morally-good, but not that of the moral
   in its secondary sense; in his view a definition of the moral should
   include also the morally-evil. It is evidently proper, however, to
   confine a notion primarily to the normal manifestation of its contents,
   and to treat the contrary manifestation as an abnormal perversion.
   Surely, for example, it would be too much to ask that the notion of the
   rational be so conceived as to embrace also the irrational,--that of
   organism, so as to include also disease. In fact the objection of Rothe
   has weight with him, chiefly for the reason that, in his system, evil
   is viewed not as a merely morbid phenomenon, but on the contrary as a
   necessary transition-state of development; in which case, of course, a
   definition of the moral would have to include also evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LIII. The Moral. (Cont'd)

   Though morality, as the free realizing of the good, appears essentially
   in the sphere of the will, yet as this will is a rational one,--the
   expression of a consciousness and of a love to the object of that
   consciousness,--hence, morality embraces the whole life and being of
   the spirit in all its forms of manifestation, as knowing, feeling, and
   willing. Moral knowledge is faith, not only religious, but also
   rational faith in general; moral feeling is pleasure in the good, and
   love of it, and, on the other hand, displeasure in the non-good; moral
   willing is a striving after the realization of the good. Morality
   itself, however, is not one of these three, but always and necessarily
   the union of all three of these phases of the spirit-life.

   These three phases of the spirit-life are severally and collectively an
   expression of the union of the subject with objective being, with the
   All in general,--in the final instance with God. The subject itself
   becomes also to itself an object, and only thereby attains to its
   truth. The mere isolatedness of a being is per se evil, is the opposite
   of true existence and life, the ruin of life, that is, death,--is a
   dissolution of the unitary collective life into indifferent ultimate
   atoms. The individual exists in its truth only in so far as it comes
   into union with the All; this union is not its annihilation but its
   preservation, its recognition in the All as an organic member of the
   same; it is a mutual, vital relation, a unity in diversity; and this is
   in fact the essence of life, namely, that both the individual being and
   the collective whole, in all its parts, stand in relation to each
   other, and that, in this relation, the individual is, on the one hand,
   as a member, quite as fully at one with the whole, as, on the other, it
   is an integral being of itself.

   In actively knowing, man brings the object into relation to
   himself,--takes it up, in its idea, spiritually into himself; in
   feeling, the subject brings himself in this spiritual appropriation
   into relation to himself,--embraces the appropriated object as in
   harmony or as in disharmony with his own being and character, that is,
   as pleasing or displeasing; in willing, the subject assumes an active
   determining relation toward the approvingly or disapprovingly received
   object; hence, the will rests on feeling, as in turn, feeling on
   knowledge, though the latter may be obscure and only half-conscious. In
   each of these three respects the spirit may be more or less free or
   unfree; in so far so it is free, it is also moral. It is true, knowing
   and feeling are primarily unfree,--they press themselves directly upon
   the essentially passive subject without his voluntary co-operation, and
   in so far as this is the case they are as yet extra-moral; but the
   moment they appear as freely willed they enter into the moral sphere,
   and this is their higher, rational form. Knowing is moral when we will
   to know rationally, that is, when we embrace isolated being, whether
   that of objective nature or of ourselves, as not existing for itself in
   its isolation, but on the contrary, when, passing beyond its
   isolatedness, we conceive it as having ultimately a divine ground,--in
   other words, when we associate all individual being with the infinite
   being and life of God, and thus conceive all existence as unitary and
   as established by God. Now, this passing beyond the individual object
   is not an unfree process; the object does not force us to do so, much
   rather it arrests us at its own immediate reality; but it is our
   rational nature that induces us to will to pass beyond. Knowing becomes
   moral when it becomes a pious consciousness,--assumes a religious
   character; and this pious associating of the finite with the infinite
   is faith, which is in its very essence religious. Faith can never be
   compelled by a presentation of arguments; in all its forms it is a
   voluntary matter; and from the simple fact that faith is a moral
   knowing, and hence includes within itself willingness and love, it is
   consequently not a mere knowing, not a mere holding-for-true; hence it
   may be, and is, a moral requirement. Without this willingness to find
   and acknowledge the divine in infinite objects, there is no knowledge
   of God, and hence no real rationality of knowledge. Though faith is
   essentially religious, nevertheless, springing forth from this source,
   it overflows and fructifies with its moral potency the entire field of
   rational knowledge. By virtue of this faith we have confidence in the
   truthfulness of the universe,--confidence that truth is discoverable,
   that the laws of our mind and the impressions made upon us by the
   external world are not untrue and defective, that divine order and
   conformity to law, and hence conformity to reason, pervade the
   universe, so that, consequently, we may rely on this order and this
   conformity to law. Without such a faith, without such a confidence
   independently of all presentation of evidence, there could be no
   knowledge--no possibility of a spiritual life in general. Without this
   confidence we would be unable to avoid suspecting poison in every cup
   of water, in every morsel of bread,--we would tremble lest, at every
   step, the ground might give way beneath our feet. Fondness of doubting
   presupposes depravity; skepticism proper, like the arts of sophistry,
   is an immoral dissolution of rational knowledge; under the skeptic's
   eye, both the spiritual world and the realm of nature fall apart into
   lifeless ultimate atoms.

   In so far as feeling is simply a direct consciousness of such an
   impressed state of the subject, it is as yet extra-moral, because
   unfree; it becomes rational and moral through freedom on the basis of
   the religious consciousness,--namely, when I do not permit myself to be
   determined by finite things in an absolutely passive manner, but, on
   the contrary, when I subordinate all my states of feeling to the power
   of faith or of the religious consciousness,--in a word, when I rise so
   far into the sphere of freedom as to have pleasure only in that which
   is God-pleasing, and displeasure only in the ungodly,--when my love to
   finite things is only a phase of my love to God.

   The will, the more immediate sphere of the moral, is in itself likewise
   not as yet moral, but must first become so. Free will, as distinguished
   from the unfree impulse of the brute, is primarily as yet devoid of
   positive contents,--is only the possibility, but not the actuality, of
   the moral. It becomes a really free and, hence, a moral will only by
   coining into relation to faith, namely, in that it ceases to be a
   merely individual will determined solely by the isolated personality of
   the subject,--for, as such, it is as yet simply irrational and
   animal,--and furthermore in that it imbues itself with a positive
   faith,--determines itself by its God-consciousness and by its love to
   God,--so that thus, passing beyond mere finite being, it bases its
   outgoings on a rational faith in the infinite. This is so wide-reaching
   a condition of the moral will, that even an evil will (which also lies
   within the sphere of the moral) is determined by a certain
   faith-consciousness, seeing that such a will is a rebelling against its
   God-consciousness; "devils also believe" in God's existence "and
   tremble" [James ii, 19]; the degree of guilt is strictly determined by
   the degree in which God is known. Hence the will is morally good when
   it rests on faith,--when it strives to realize the God-pleasing because
   of its God-consciousness and of its love to God; and it is morally evil
   when, despite its God-consciousness, it aims at the ungodly,--seeks to
   divorce finite beings, and especially its own, from its union with God.
   Hence in general terms, though morality has its essential sphere in the
   will, yet it also embraces, as intimately involved therein, the spheres
   of knowledge and of feeling.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LIV. The Moral. (Concl'd)

   As the life of a rational spirit is continuous, namely, a continuous
   free activity, hence it bears continuously a moral character. Morality
   is not simply a succession of single moral points, it is an
   uninterrupted life, and every moment of the same is either in harmony
   or in antagonism with the moral end,--is either good or evil. In the
   entire life of man there is not a single morally indifferent moment or
   state.

   Man is God's image only in so far as he lives this God-likeness, for
   God is life, and all life is continuous; a real interruption of the
   same is its destruction,--is death. Sleep is only a change in the
   manifestation of life, arising from the union of the spirit with
   material nature, but not a real interruption of the same. Spirit sleeps
   not; also the slumbering spirit is moral,--may be pure or impure; the
   soul of the saint cannot have unholy dreams; dreams are often unwelcome
   mirrorings forth of impure hearts; when Jacob rebuked his son Joseph
   for his supposed ambitious dream [Gen. xxxvii, 10], his moral judgment
   was quite correct,--simply his hypothesis was erroneous. Ally
   assumption that there are morally indifferent moments in life is
   anti-moral. And that there are;, in fact, in the natural life of man
   middle states between life and death,--for example, swoons,--is of
   itself a fruit of depravity, and in the same sense that death is such.
   Morality is the health of the rational spirit; and every interruption
   of health is disease. God's will is incessantly binding; there is
   absolutely nothing conceivable which would not either harmonize with,
   or antagonize, it.
     __________________________________________________________________

II. RELATION OF MORALITY TO RELIGION.

    SECTION LV. Relation of Morality to Religion.

   The religious consciousness,--which expresses the conditionment of our
   being and life by God, and which, as a state of heart, is piety,--is
   necessarily and intimately connected with morality, so that neither is
   possible without the other; yet they are not identical. Religion and
   morality, both, bring man into relation to God. In religion, however,
   his relation is rather of a receptive character,--he permits the divine
   to rule in him; in morality he is more self-active, he reflects forth
   the God-pleasing from within himself. In religion he exalts himself to
   communion with God; in morality he evidences this communion by
   developing the divine image both in himself and in the external world.
   In religion he turns himself away from finite individuality and
   multiplicity, and toward the unitary central-point of all life; in
   morality he turns himself from this divine life-center as a basis,
   toward the periphery of created being,--from unity toward
   multiplicity,--in order to manifest the former in the latter. The two
   movements correspond to the double life-stream in every natural
   organism, and hence they are simply two inseparably united phases of
   one and the same spiritual life; and the very commencement of spiritual
   life involves the union of them both. In religion and in morality God
   glorifies himself no less than in creation,--in religion for and in
   man, in morality through man; and the moral man, in that lie fulfills
   God's will in and for the world, actually accomplishes the divine
   purpose in creation,--the free moral activity of man being, in fact,
   the divinely-willed continuation and completion of the work of
   creation.

   The consciousness that we, as separate individuals, have no absolutely
   self-sufficient and independent existence and rights, as also that we
   are not simply dependent on other finite powers, but, on the contrary,
   on an infinite divine first cause, is of a religious character; and the
   spiritual life that develops itself on the basis of this consciousness
   is the religious life. In so far, however, as it is a disposition or
   state of heart, that is, in so far as it expresses itself in the
   feeling of love to God and in the thence-arising habit of will, it is
   piety,--in which form it assumes directly also the character of
   morality. A pious life is per se also a moral one; and morality is the
   practical outgoing of piety. Religion and morality are therefore most
   closely and inseparably associated; as morality rests on the
   recognition that the good is either the actual state or the final
   destination of all existence, and as this recognition, even in its
   rudest forms, is of a religious character (since the "good" can have no
   meaning save as the divine ultimate destination of creation), hence
   morality without religion is impossible, and its character rises and
   falls with the clearness and correctness of the religious
   consciousness. He who despises religion is also immoral; and the
   immoral man is also correspondingly irreligious; all immorality is a
   despising of God, since it is a despising of the good as the God-like.
   As now, on the other hand, religion is a believing, and hence a free,
   loving recognition of the divine, and as it places man in a living
   relation with God, hence all religion is per se also moral, and
   religion without morality is inconceivable.

   Thus, whatever is moral is religious, and whatever is religious is
   moral; and yet these two are not identical; every religious life
   includes in itself a moral will, and every moral action contains a
   religious element,--implies religious faith; "without faith it is
   impossible to please God" [Heb. xi, 6]. This looks like a contradiction
   utterly irreconcilable save by making religion and morality absolutely
   one and the same thing. Things, however, that are indissolubly
   associated, as, for example, heat and light in the rays of the sun,
   need not for that reason be identical. In the religiously-moral life
   two things are always united: our individual personality as a
   relatively self-dependent legitimate entity, and the recognition of God
   as the unconditioned ground of our entire being and life,--that is to
   say, an affirming and also a relative negating of our separate
   individuality, an active and a passive element. Both are equally true
   and important; the one calls for the other, and either, taken
   separately for itself, would be untrue; the two must exist in harmony
   and unity. The passive phase--the emphasizing of the being of God in
   the presence of which individual being retires into the background and
   appears only as conditioned and dependent--is the religious phase of
   the spiritual life; the active phase--that is, the emphasizing of the
   personal element by virtue of which man appears, as an initiative actor
   with the mission, as a free personality, of carrying farther forward in
   the spiritual sphere the creative work of God--is the moral phase. The
   religious life is, so to speak, centripetal; moral life, as radiating
   out from the middle-point, is centrifugal; the former corresponds, in
   the spiritual life, to the functions of the veins of the body; the
   latter is more like the arteries, which, receiving from the lungs,
   through the heart, the vitalized out-gushing blood, distribute it
   nourishingly and productively through the body, and ramify themselves
   out toward the periphery, whereas the veins conduct it back from the
   outermost ramifications toward the center. In correspondence to this
   figure, the separate outgoings of the moral life are more manifold than
   are the center-seeking manifestations of the religious life. Hence
   piety, by its very nature, tends to a communion of pious
   life-expression, to the social worship of God; but in morality the
   person comes into prominence more in his self-dependent individuality:
   in the sphere of morality, moral communion rests more on the moral
   individuals; in that of piety, the pious personality rests more upon
   pious communion and upon the spirit which inspires this communion. In
   the moral sphere, Christ says to the individual: "Go thou and do
   likewise;" in that of religion he says: "Where two or three are
   gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Secret
   prayer does not conflict with this, for it is only one phase of piety;
   the piety of the recluse is simply morbid.

   Religious life is only then genuine when it is at the same time also
   moral,--when it does not in Pantheistico-mystical wise dissolve and
   merge the individual into God; the one-sidedly religious life which
   lightly esteems outward morality entangles itself inevitably in this
   quietistic renunciation of personality. Moral life is healthy only when
   it is at the same time also religious,--when the person does not assume
   to live and act as an isolated being from an unconditioned autonomy of
   its own independently of God; it is, however, as distinguished from the
   religious life, essentially a virtualizing of liberty. The one-sidedly
   moral life, that is, the attempt to virtualize personal freedom without
   religion, leads to the reverse of the morally-religious life--to
   haughtiness of personality as of an absolutely independent power, to an
   atheistic idolizing of the creature, and, in practice, to a throwing
   off of all obligation that conflicts with personal enjoyment. The moral
   life is therefore true and good only when the virtualization of the
   freedom and independence of the person is rational, that is,
   essentially religious; and it becomes morally evil so soon as it
   asserts its freedom as unconditioned and apart from God.

   Piety and morality consequently mutually condition each other,--develop
   themselves in no other way than in union with each other. It is true,
   the first beginning of the religiously-moral life is, in so far; the
   religious phase, as all religion rests upon a revelation of God to man,
   that is, upon a receiving, and not upon a personal doing; but this
   revelation is only then our- own, the contents of our religious spirit,
   when we embrace it in faith, and this embracing is a free, a moral
   activity. Hence even the first incipiency of the rational, the
   morally-religious life includes in immediate and necessary union both
   phases of the same, so that, though in logic we may speak of the one as
   being; antecedent to the other, yet in point of reality we cannot so
   speak. Should this seem enigmatical to the understanding, still it is
   no more enigmatical than is the nature of all and every life-beginning;
   and just as little as we can deny the reality of the beginning of man's
   natural life, for the reason that it is absolutely hidden and
   mysterious--so that we can neither say that the material being of the
   same is antecedent to its spiritual power nor the converse,--even so
   little can we hope to solve the mystery of the beginning of the
   religiously-moral life, by assuming the one or the other of its phases
   as the first and fundamental one. The plant, in developing itself out
   of its embryo, grows upward and downward almost simultaneously; if it
   is insufficiently rooted it fades; if it cannot grow upward it decays;
   the sending out of roots corresponds to religion; the development into
   foliage and fruit, to morality. Also in the further development of the
   rational life these two phases are constantly associated, and in their
   associated unity and harmony consists the spiritual health of man. We
   are religious in so far as we recognize that God is the unconditioned
   ground of our being and moral life; moral, in so far as by our free
   life we confess in acts that God is for us the absolute rule of
   action,--that we are free accomplishers of the divine will. In
   religion, God is for us; in morality, we are for God; in the former God
   is manifested to us; in the latter God is manifested in and through us.
   "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" [Gal. ii, 20]; this is the
   essence of Christian morality. "As many as are led by the Spirit of
   God, they are the sons of God" [Rom. viii, 14]; that is, religion is
   the vitality of morality, and morality the factive life-manifestation
   of religion, and consequently of divine sonship. "Fear God and keep his
   commandments, for this is the whole duty of man" [Eccl. xii, 13; comp.
   Deut. x, 12]; hence the fear of God is the ground and beginning of
   moral wisdom; "this is the fear of God, that we keep his commandments"
   [1 John v, 3]. According to the uniform tenor of Scripture, religion
   and morality go always hand in hand; this is aptly expressed by Luther
   in his Catechism: "We should fear and love God, in order that," etc.;
   the fear of God necessarily involves the keeping of the commandments,
   and this fear is itself of moral character, as is implied by the very
   word "should"; "if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door" [Gen.
   iv, 7]. Hence the usual Scripture expression for morality is: "to walk
   before God" [Gen. xvii, 1; xxiv, 40], that is, to act out of a full
   consciousness of the holy and almighty One, in full trust and love to
   Him; or: "to walk with God" [Gen. v, 22, 24; vi, 9], to "keep the way
   of the Lord" and "do justice and judgment" [Gen. xviii, 19], "to walk
   in God's ways," "to serve the Lord" and "to keep his commandments and
   statutes" [Deut. x, 12]; and God's exhortation to the progenitor of the
   Israelites is: "I am the Almighty God, [therefore] walk before me and
   be thou perfect" [Gen. xvii, 1].

   The glorifying of God in religion and morality is the completing of his
   glorification in nature. In religion, God permits the man who comes
   into living communion with Him, to behold his glory; in morality God
   permits men to show forth his glory--to let their light shine before
   others that they also may praise the Father in heaven. The will of God
   in creation was not as yet fulfilled at the conclusion of the creative
   act. "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness," --but this
   image is God-like, not in its mere being, but only in its rational,
   moral life. God created the world for rational creatures, in order that
   for them and through them his image might be manifested in
   creation,--that is to say, in the interest of moral development. Hence
   sin is treachery against God, an infringement on his honor. Morality
   looks to the honor, not of man, but of God; it is per se a serving of
   God, and all divine service or worship is a moral act.

   The relation of religion to morality is often stated quite differently
   from the view here presented. The more important of these views are the
   following four:

   (1) Religion and morality are totally identical. In developing this
   view, the one is necessarily reduced to the other. (a) Morality is
   entirely merged into religion--the view of all consistent mysticism;
   man has nothing to do but to give himself entirely over to God; and
   wisdom consists not in acting, but, on the contrary, in renouncing all
   practical activity (Eckart, Tauler, Molinos). (b) Religion is entirely
   merged into morality. Morality is directly in and of itself true
   religion; to be moral is identical with being pious; outside of virtue.
   there is no piety which is not only not simply associated with virtue,
   but which is not, in fact, itself virtue;--the view of the
   worldly-minded in general, and, particularly, of the "illuminism" of
   the eighteenth century.

   (2) Religion and morality are in their entire nature radically
   different, and hence entirely independent of each other; the one may
   exist without the other. This is the view of all the naturalistic
   systems of recent date. It is at once refuted by the simple fact that
   the different religions have given rise to correspondingly different
   systems of morality.--In approximation to this view, Rothe affirms
   (Ethik, I, Seite, 191, sqq.) at least a predominant non-dependence of
   the two spheres on each other.

   His position is as follows:--Morality and piety, while not entirely
   different, are yet relatively independent and self-based. Each has
   indeed a certain relation to the other, and there is no morality which
   is not, in some degree, also piety; both have the same root, namely,
   the personality; but the two form, nevertheless, independent branches
   strictly coetaneous. The consciousness of this relative independence of
   morality belongs among the inalienable conquests of recent
   culture,--namely, the consciousness that an individual human life may
   be relatively determined by the idea of the moral, nay, even by the
   idea of the morally good, or, more definitely, by the idea of human
   dignity and of humanity, without at the same time being determined by
   the idea of God,--and indeed in such a manner that it shall possess
   this idea of the moral as not derived to it from the idea of God. The
   Christian moralist cannot refuse to recognize this consciousness. The
   misconception, that morality can rest on no other basis than the
   religious relation, would at once vanish, could moralists determine to
   keep distinct the moral sensu medio, from the morally-good. For, that
   there can be moral evil on a basis other than a religious one, will of
   course be questioned by none. It is true, when strictly understood or
   comprehended, the idea of the moral cannot arise apart from the idea of
   God.--These last two statements of Rothe undermine his entire position;
   for the question here is not at all as to evil, but exclusively as to
   the morally-good; and it is hardly possible that any one would argue
   thus: Because evil can exist without religion, therefore also the good
   can exist without religion. Moreover, in admitting that without
   religion man can be morally-good only relatively, but not truly, Rothe
   implicitly admits also that morality is in fact not a something
   existing alongside of religion and in real independency of it;
   consequently the above-assumed morality that is independent of
   religion, is but mere appearance.

   (3) Religion is the first, the basis, also in point of time; while
   morality is the second, the sequence. This is the most usual, also
   ecclesiastical, view; and as applied to Christian morality it is also
   undoubtedly correct, since here the question is as to being redeemed
   from a presupposed immoral state; in which case, of course, the
   religious back-ground forms the basis of the renewal, from which, as a
   starting-point, the moral will, in general, must rise to freedom.
   Where, however, the moral life does not presuppose a spiritual
   regeneration, there no moment of the religious life is conceivable in
   which it does not also contain in itself the moral element,--thus
   absolutely precluding the idea of a precedency of one to the other;
   moreover, even in the spiritual regeneration of the sinner, the process
   of being morally laid hold upon by the sanctifying Spirit of God,
   issues directly into a willing, and hence moral, laying hold upon the
   offered grace of God.

   (4) Morality is the first, the basis, while religion is the second, the
   sequence, also in point of time; the moral consciousness of the
   practical reason is the ground upon which the God-consciousness springs
   up;--so taught the school of Kant, and in part, also, Rationalism. This
   view, in its practical application, coincides largely with that one
   which merges the religious into the moral. It is true, appeal is made
   to the passage in John vii, 7: "If any one will do his will," etc.;
   here, however, the question is not as to the religious consciousness in
   general, but as to the recognition of Christ as the Messenger of God.
   But whoever purposes to do the will of God, must have a consciousness
   of God already.

   From the intimate unity of religion and morality, which we have
   insisted upon, results readily the solution of the question, as to how
   and whence we can have a knowledge of the moral condition of humanity
   as pure and unfallen. The sources of a knowledge of religion are at the
   same time, also, the sources of an acquaintance with morality; and
   religion throws light not only upon what has transpired and now is,
   since the fall, but also upon what preceded all sin. Thus we have for
   morality in general, as well as for the consideration of morality
   irrespectively of sin, the following sources of information:--l. The
   rational, morally-religious human consciousness, both as it is yet
   extant even in the natural man, and also, as it is enlightened by
   divine grace in the redeemed.--2. The historical revelation of God in
   the Old and New Testaments. Although as bearing upon the moral sphere
   Revelation relates predominantly to the actual sinful condition of
   humanity, yet it contains also, at the same time, the holy will of God
   to man per se. The moral law of Christ, "Thou shalt love thy God,"
   etc., is in fact absolutely valid, not only for such as are as yet
   implicated in sin, but also for man per se, and irrespectively of sin;
   moreover, it is not difficult for the Christian who has become
   acquainted with the divine economy of grace to distinguish, in the
   divine precepts, that which is intended for the chastening and
   discipline of the sinner, from that which is morally binding per
   se.--3. From the personal example of Him who knew no sin, from the holy
   humanity of the Redeemer.--So much here merely preliminarily.

III. SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION OF ETHICS.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LVI. Scientific Classification of Ethics.

   The usual distribution of the subject-matter of ethics into the
   doctrine of goods, of virtues, and of duties, does not answer the
   nature of this science, as these are not different parts of the whole,
   but only different modes of contemplating one and the same
   thing,--modes which are so intimately involved in each other, that such
   a classification inevitably involves, on the one hand, an unnatural
   severing of the subject-matter, and, on the other, manifold repetitions
   of the same thought. All the various articulations of this science into
   the mere discussion of virtues, duties, and goods, according to the
   different classes and subdivisions of particular virtues, duties, and
   goods, come short of exhausting the subject-matter, and must therefore
   involve the throwing of other important ethical considerations into an
   introduction or some other subordinate position.

   Among the various classifications of the matter of ethics, the
   above-mentioned is in recent times the more usual; it is adopted by
   Schleiermacher, though only in his Philosophical Ethics, and it is
   applied by Rothe to Theological Ethics also. In both of these writers,
   the importance of such a classification lies in the thought of the
   working of reason upon nature, in which morality is by them made to
   consist. The goal of this working, namely, the positive harmony of
   nature and reason, is the good; the power of reason which works this
   good, is virtue; the mode of procedure for working the good, the
   directing of the activity toward it, is duty. [3] This view,
   irrespectively of the so-strongly emphasized thought of Rothe, of the
   good as a harmony of (material) nature and reason,--which is utterly
   inapplicable to Christian morality,--is in fact valid also for
   Christian ethics (Schwarz). In Christ's words: "Seek ye first the
   kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things [temporal
   goods] shall be added unto you" [Matt. vi, 33], are comprehended both
   the highest good and the single goods, duty and virtue,--the latter
   being embraced in "righteousness," though righteousness is indeed more
   than virtue. There is a difference between the goal to be reached, the
   way or movement toward it, and the power of the subject which
   conditions this movement; still it does not follow from this that the
   entire subject-matter of ethics can be organically and exclusively
   distributed on this basis. The antithesis of duties and goods could be
   most easily carried out, since the producing activity and the produced
   result are clearly distinguishable. But even here the difficulty
   arises, that true good, and hence, of course, also happiness (as
   Aristotle very justly remarks), is not an inert result but an activity;
   but every activity, if it is rational, must be the expression of a
   moral idea, the realizing of a duty; so that we are brought to the at
   first strange-seeming conclusion, that dutiful acting is itself a part
   of the being and essence of the good,--is in one respect itself a good.
   The family, the church, the state, etc., are goods; but these all are
   conditioned not merely on dutiful acting,--they themselves are a purely
   moral life,--consist, strictly speaking, in a collectivity of moral
   actions, although not solely therein. If we once abstract these
   actions, there remains neither family nor state nor church; these are
   not mere empty spaces in which moral acting takes place, but they are
   themselves incessantly generated by this acting, and without it would
   not exist,--just as the fiery ring of a revolved torch is not an entity
   per se, but exists alone by virtue of the motion. Hence the visible
   embarrassment of the ethical writers in question as to where they shall
   treat, for example, of family and political duties, whether under the
   head of duties proper or of goods.--Still more embarrassing is it in
   the discussion of the virtues. That virtue is per se a good, being an
   end to be acquired by moral effort, is perfectly evident, and is so
   admitted by Schleiermacher (Werke, III, 2, 459); also in the
   above-cited utterance of Christ, righteousness appears as a goal of
   effort, as an element of the essence of the kingdom of God [comp. Phil.
   iv, 8]; we aim at virtue, and we possess virtues; but every possession
   is a good. Now as goods are of course not merely objective,--as indeed
   the highest good of Christians, the possession of the kingdom of God,
   comes not with outward observation but is of a strictly inward
   character [Luke xvii, 20, 21],--hence it is plain that virtue is also a
   good; as indeed the kingdom of God consists "in power" [1 Cor. iv, 20],
   and hence by its very nature includes in itself virtue. Hence the
   doctrine of goods cannot be discussed without treating also of virtue.
   On the other hand, a merely dormant power is in reality nothing at all;
   the reality of a power is its outgoing,--the reality of virtue is moral
   action, that is, the fulfilling of duty. It is not possible, therefore,
   to discuss the virtues without at the same time treating of all the
   duties, and vice versa. Hence the distribution of ethics
   above-mentioned can be adhered to only so long as the discussion
   lingers in generalities and avoids the particular.

   Schleiermacher and Rothe, in fact, admit that the three divisions,
   goods, virtues, and duties, are not, in reality, different parts of,
   but only a three-fold manner of viewing, the same object,--yet in such
   a manner that in each of the three the other two are included, if not
   expressly, at least substantially. The doctrine of goods, of virtues or
   of duties, embraces, either of them, according to Schleiermacher, when
   fully developed, the whole of ethics (Syst., p. 76 sqq.). The
   classification in question can therefore be carried out only by
   arbitrarily leaving some of the divisions imperfectly discussed.
   Particular goods, says Rothe, do not spring from the working of a
   particular virtue and through the fulfilling of a particular duty, but
   on the contrary no single one is realized otherwise than through the
   co-working of all the virtues and through the fulfilling of all the
   duties, and each single virtue contributes to the realization of all
   the goods, and is conditioned on the fulfilling of all the duties, and
   each particular virtue contributes in turn to every dutiful manner of
   action (i, 202). Irrespectively of the fact that the latter
   declarations are too sweeping,--seeing that, for example, the family
   may often exist as a good without the virtue of courage, of industry,
   etc., and that courage may exist apart from the fulfillment of the
   family duties, etc.,--still it is quite evident that if either of the
   three divisions in question were really and completely, and not merely
   in general, carried out, there would remain nothing for the other
   divisions save a few general observations. The family, for example, is
   a good only in so far as it has domestic love for its basis, and, in
   point of fact, Rothe treats of domestic love among the goods; but what
   remains then to be said of it in treating of the virtues and duties?
   The remarkable scantiness of Schleiermacher's discussion of duties is
   itself evidence of an erroneous classification. And Rothe obtains for
   his discussion of duties (in fact confessedly finds any occasion
   whatever therefor) simply because, as he says, reference is there to be
   had to sin, so that the discussion of duties becomes essentially the
   portrayal of struggle. But this admission destroys the very basis of
   the classification;--were it not for sin, a discussion of duties would
   not be possible, whereas the basis of this classification has not the
   least reference to sin. If Schleiermacher, after speaking, in his first
   part, of chastity and unchastity, had then in his second part spoken of
   chastity as among the virtues,--which his plan required of him, but
   which he does not do--and in his third part fully discussed the duties
   of chastity, then in order to carry out his classification he would
   have had to reiterate the same matter three times.--Rothe speaks in
   very strong expressions against those who do not adopt this
   classification, affirming that all previous ethical teaching and
   phraseology have been erroneous, and have ignored the fact that even
   every-day parlance makes a difference between being virtuous and acting
   dutifully;--as if common usage does not, just as frequently and just as
   correctly, speak also of acting virtuously and being true to duty!
   Oddly enough it seems, in the face of this so-deemed "imperishable
   desert" of Schleiermacher in regard to this classification, that
   Schleiermacher himself--clearer-sighted here than Rothe--does not apply
   it to his own Christian Ethics; and not only that, but he even declares
   it inadmissable here,--seeing that a description of virtue and a
   description of the kingdom of God as the highest good, cannot possibly
   be kept separate, inasmuch as virtue is simply a "habitus" generated by
   the Holy Spirit as indwelling in the kingdom of God; nor can Christian
   ethics, in his opinion, be treated under the-head of duties, seeing
   that no one duty can be discussed save in and with the totality of all
   the duties, and hence in connection with the idea of the kingdom of God
   (Chr. Sitte., p. 77 sqq.). And the same might also be said against the
   application of this classification to Philosophical Ethics.

   If this classification of general ethics into the doctrines of goods,
   of virtues and of duties, is practically untenable, much more is it
   inapplicable to Christian Ethics, since it lacks one essential
   Christian thought, that of the divine law. Schleiermacher presented no
   discussion of the law, as he wrote wholly irrespectively of the idea of
   God; and for this reason alone his classification would be inapplicable
   to Christian Ethics. For duty is not identical with the law. The law is
   objective, duty subjective; the law is the moral idea per se in its
   definite form, as thought, as universally valid--the will of God in
   general; duty is the subjective realization of the law for a particular
   individual under particular circumstances,--relates per se always to
   the strictly particular, the actual. The law is valid always, and under
   all circumstances; duty varies largely according to time and
   circumstances; the very same mode of action which is to-day my duty,
   may be to-morrow, contrary to my duty;--to-day my duty is silence,
   to-morrow I must speak. The law is categorical, duty is usually
   hypothetical; the former is the expression of divine morality, the
   latter of human. So also is the relation of goods to virtue; the former
   are more the general, objective phase; the latter is more the
   particular, personal, subjective phase; virtue is the subjective
   possession of a moral power the product of which is objective good. In
   the Old Testament the moral life-movement went over from the divine
   objective will, namely, the law, to the human subject in order to bring
   the latter into possession of the highest good; in the Christian world
   the moral life-movement goes out from the subject as being already in
   union with God, and already in possession of the everlasting good, and
   directs itself to the objective realization of God-like being,--from
   the inward possession of the kingdom of God to the objective
   manifestation and realization of the same.

   Of other scientific classifications, we will say but little. The older
   popular division of the subject-matter of ethics according to the Ten
   Commandments, was a form very well adapted for popular Christian
   instruction, and, indeed, by giving a large construction to the more
   immediate scope of these commandments, it admits of the treatment of
   all evangelically-ethical thoughts: it does not, however, suffice for a
   scientific development of Christian ethics, seeing that this series of
   commands was constructed primarily for merely practical purposes; very
   essential points, such as the moral essence of man and of the good, and
   (as parts of the latter) of the state and the church, would have to be
   thrown into introductory or collateral remarks.--The classification
   according to our duties to God, to our neighbor, and to ourselves,
   while in fact embracing the whole circle of duties, yet requires
   likewise too much of the essential matter to be thrown into an
   introduction.--Harless makes the divisions, the good itself, the
   possession of the good, and the preservation of the good; but by "good"
   he understands rather the antecedent condition than the goal of the
   moral life; by "possession," more the obtaining and preserving of the
   possession; and by "preservation," rather its actual manifestation.
   This, as well as Schleiermacher's theological classification, relates
   only to distinctively Christian ethics.--A very common classification
   is, into general and special ethics,--the latter treating of the
   special circumstances and relations of the moral life; but such a
   system can be carried out without violence only when the first division
   is reduced to a mere general introduction.

    SECTION LVII. Scientific Classification of Ethics. (Concl'd)

   Morality is life, and hence, activity or movement, and more definitely,
   rationally-free movement. Herein lie three things: the subject that
   moves, the end toward which the movement goes out, and the
   movement-activity itself. The subject goes out from its immediate
   condition of being per se, through movement, over into another
   condition which lies before it as an end. But the moral subject is not
   a mere isolated individual; on the contrary, it is the freely
   self-developing image of God as the primitive ground and prototype of
   all morality, and it lives only in virtue of constant inner-communion
   with God. The holily-ruling God becomes, as distinguished from man, the
   eternal, holy proto-subject of the moral life; and there is no moment
   of the moral life in which the human subject, strictly per se and
   without God's cooperation, works the good.--The goal toward which the
   moral movement directs itself is also of a twofold character. Man finds
   himself already in the presence of an objective world different from
   himself; and even where he makes himself his own object, this, his
   reality, is, primarily, a gift conferred upon him without any moral
   action on his own part; this conferred existence (world and self) is
   the working-sphere of his moral activity--the most immediate object and
   end of the same. But man is not, in his activity, to throw himself away
   upon this objective world-to merge himself into it--but he is to shape
   it by his own power, and in harmony with the moral idea,--to male the
   possibility of the good into real good, to realize a spiritual end in
   and through the objective world. Hence the goal of the moral activity
   is to be considered under two phases: (a) As a pure object untouched as
   yet by the moral activity,--as a mere platform, as material given for
   the moral activity in order to be spiritually dominated by this
   activity so as to become a spiritually and morally formed real good.
   (b) This object itself as morally fashioned, as having become a
   good,--existing primarily only as an idea, a rational purpose, but
   afterward as a result of moral activity, as a fruit realized,--that is
   the ideal goal proper, or the end of the moral activity. In the first
   case, the object is, for the moral activity, a directly-given reality,
   but it is not to remain as such; in the second case it is primarily not
   real, but exists only in thought, but it is ultimately to become a
   reality expressive of the thought.--The third phase of the moral
   movement, namely, the moral activity itself, is, as spiritually free,
   likewise of a twofold character; on the one hand, it is to be
   considered from its subjective side, that is, in respect to how it is
   rooted in the subject himself, and from him issues forth,--the
   subjective motive of the moral activity, the source of the stream; on
   the other hand, it is to be considered as a life-stream, sent forth
   from the subject and directed upon the object,--that is, the activity
   proper itself as having become real and objective in its progressive
   development toward the attained goal in which it ends.

   The subject-matter of ethics falls, therefore, into the following
   subdivisions:

   1. The moral subject, purely in and of itself considered.

   2. God as the objective ground of the moral life and of the moral law,
   and also as the prototype of the moral idea, and as co-working in the
   moral life.

   3. The given objective existence upon which, as material to be
   fashioned, the moral activity exerts itself.

   4. The subjective ground of the moral activity, the personal motive to
   morality.

   5. The moral working or acting itself, the moral life-movement toward
   the moral goal.

   6. The conceived object of the moral activity, its goal or end,--the
   good as an object to be realized.

   While Dogmatics sets out most naturally from the thought of God, Ethics
   takes its start from man, the moral subject, inasmuch as morality in
   its totality is simply the rational life-development of man,--God
   coming into consideration here not so much in his character as Creator
   as rather in that of a Lawgiver and righteously-ruling Governor. Should
   we, however, divorce Ethics entirely from Dogmatics, we would, of
   course, have to preface the moral discussion of man by a presentation
   of the doctrine of God.

   The idea of the moral subject, of the rational personality, is the
   foundation-thought of ethics,--the root out of which all the other
   branches spring. But man is a morally rational person only in so far as
   he conceives of himself, not as an isolated individual, but as
   conditioned by the divine reason and the divine holiness. Hence the
   idea of the moral personality leads out beyond itself to the thought of
   God, as the eternal fountain and the measure of morality, as the holy
   and just Lawgiver; the prototypal relation of God to the moral has its
   personally-historical manifestation in Christ, the Son of God; the
   moral idea becomes in Christ an actually-realized ideal. The doctrine
   of the moral law belongs not in the sphere of the human subject, but in
   that of the divine, for the law is not man's but God's will.

   In the notion of the moral subject considered as an individual being,
   there lies implicitly also the notion of an objective world different
   from the same. Morality, as active life, has this world before it as
   its theater of effort; the activity in its outgoing comes into contact
   with a reality independent of itself, which, though because of the
   unity of creation it is not antagonistic to the subject, is
   nevertheless primarily foreign to the same, and not in any wise imbued
   with or dominated by it. But to be a spirit, implies in itself the
   dominating of the unspiritual, the entering into harmony with all that
   is spiritual. It is the task of the moral subject to bring about this
   domination and this harmony. Moreover, in so far as man finds himself
   in a simply given, and not as yet spiritually-dominated and cultivated
   condition, he becomes to himself his own object, his moral activity
   being directed upon himself.

   The modifying activity as exerted upon this given existence is not,
   however, of a purposeless character, but it has before it, in the
   rational end, an ideal object the realizing of which is to be effected
   by the activity as moral. In an ethical discussion which follows the
   actual order of the moral life, this moral activity will have to be
   considered first, although with constant reference to the moral end.
   This activity, as a spiritual outgoing from the subject, has, on the
   one hand, its fountain in the moral subject, on the other, it has also
   a development-course as a stream. Each is to be considered separately,
   so that we have here again two subdivisions. The consideration of the
   subjective origin or ground of the moral activity--its motive,--has to
   do with the why. The existence of the law and the encountering of an
   external world by the subject, do not suffice to explain why man should
   enter upon a course of moral activity; there must be found, as
   distinguished from these, a motive in the subject himself that prompts
   directly to moral activity,--that sets the subject into movement. The
   mere "should" is not enough to move us; we may remain indifferent and
   emotionless in the presence of every "categorical imperative" and of
   every, however well-grounded, command; if there is not some impulse to
   activity within us, all and every command will fall back powerless from
   us; and this impulse must be of a rationally-free, a moral character.

   The moral activity itself, which is occasioned by this inner motive, is
   to be considered primarily only in its essence and in its general forms
   of manifestation, and it involves only the general, but not the
   special, discussion of the doctrine of duties. By far the largest scope
   of special activity comes under the last division of our
   classification; for the true essence and real worth of moral good lies
   in the fact that it is not a dormant possession, but that, on the
   contrary, it unfolds continuously new and richer life,--just as a
   natural fruit is not simply a product in which the life of the plant
   ends, but is also the germ of a new life;--with this difference,
   however, that the fruit of the moral activity is not merely the germ of
   a new life that simply repeats its former self, but rather of an
   enriched, spiritually-heightened life. In the attained moral good the
   moral life-movement rises to a new, higher circulation; the person in
   possession of this good has become richer,--is a spiritually
   higher-developed personality; the previously existing moral-subject has
   become more exalted and spiritualized,--is, in fact, the already
   attained moral good itself; and the moral activity gains thereby ampler
   and more ennobled contents; with the acquired good springs up new duty.

   In elucidation of the classification we have given, compare the
   passages Deut. x, 12 sqq.; xi, 1 sqq.; xii, 1 sqq. Here we may consider
   as the moral subject the people of Israel,--the moral mission and
   activity of whom cannot possibly be understood save in the light of
   their historically-moral peculiarity. Jehovah is the sovereign,
   requiring moral obedience to his will; the people's sinful hearts [x,
   16], the heathen country and inhabitants [x, 19; xi, 10 sqq.; xii, 2
   sqq.], and the national life of the Israelites, form the sphere. the
   theater, of the moral activity; thankful love to the merciful,
   longsuffering God is the moral motive [x, 15, 21 sqq.]; willing
   obedience, the walking in the ways of God, is the moral activity; and
   the approbation of God and his blessings are the moral end [x, 13-15;
   xi, 8 sqq.; xii, 7 sqq.].

   In consideration of the thought that there lies at the basis of all
   moral activity an end to which the activity directs itself, it might
   seem more correct to consider this end, namely, the good, before
   discussing the moral activity itself; however, on the other hand, as
   the realization of the good presupposes the moral activity, and as we
   are to consider the good not as simply conceived, but as realized, and,
   inasmuch as out of the realization of one good a new field of moral
   activity arises in turn before us, hence it is clearly more natural, in
   fact, to place the discussion of the end or the good (as being actually
   the last in the order of the moral development) in the last place; for,
   it is in fact quite evident, that we cannot speak of the family, the
   church, and the state, without having first examined the moral activity
   per se. To begin with the discussion of the good would be the so-called
   "analytical method," whereas ours, on the contrary, is the
   "synthetic;"--the course of the former is, so to speak, retrogressive;
   while the latter proceeds forward, more in the actual course of the
   moral development, and hence is the more natural.

   The first three subdivisions of our classification embrace, it is true,
   only the antecedent conditions of the moral activity itself; but it
   does not follow from this that their subject-matter is to be thrown
   into an introduction. Free rational life, as an object of ethics,
   cannot be treated as a mere activity without taking into consideration
   also the active subject, as well as the law by which the subject is
   governed, and the field upon which it acts; he who describes vegetable
   life, must surely speak also of the organs of plants. In any case, a
   controversy as to whether this consideration forms only an introduction
   to the subject-matter, or is a part of the subject-matter itself, would
   be very unprofitable.

THE MORAL SUBJECT.

    SECTION LVIII. The Moral Subject.

   THE moral subject is the personal spirit, in a stricter sense, the
   created spirit. Between the different grades of spiritual beings, there
   is, in respect to the moral life-task, no essential difference; and,
   hence, for the individual spirit, the life-task never comes to a
   definitive close. The basis of the moral life is the individual moral
   person; but in so far as a plurality of persons constitute themselves
   into a spiritual life-whole, such a collective totality becomes also
   itself a moral subject with a peculiar moral task.

   In the widest sense of the moral thought, even God himself, as the holy
   One, is a moral subject. But in so far as ethics has regard not to an
   absolutely infinite, eternal Being and life, but to a task
   accomplishing itself in time, it considers only the created spirit as a
   subject of morality. But all created personal spirits without exception
   are moral subjects, and that too with an individual task that never
   comes to a close; the blessed spirits, angels included, have not only,
   like earthly men, constantly to accomplish morality, but so soon as we
   leave sin out of view as an abnormal reality, their moral task is
   essentially the same as that of man; and Schleiermacher is wrong in
   limiting moral acting, and hence also ethics, to the, as yet, militant
   life, and in excluding them from the perfected life of the blessed
   (Syst., p. 51, 61). Unless we are to conceive the blessed as
   spiritually dead, then they must have a life-activity answering to the
   divine will,--that is, a moral one. Were this not the case, then
   Christ's holy life would be moral only so long as he had to do with an
   opposing world; and only the earthly, but not the glorified, Christ, as
   also not the saints in heaven, could be looked upon as moral examples
   for us. It is true, the manifestation-form of the morality of a blessed
   spirit will be different from that of the yet militant; nevertheless
   the essence remains the same.

   The distinguishing of the moral collective subject from the individual
   subject is a point of essential importance; for, the moral activity of
   the two is by no means the same. For the member of a moral community,
   there arise special moral duties that fall to him, not as a moral
   individual but as an organic member of a whole, and which he is to
   fulfill not in his own name but in that of the totality. The action of
   the individual is, of course, the first, the presupposition of the
   other; the moral community is always the fruit of a precedent moral
   activity of the individuals,--is itself a realized-good, which,
   however, at once becomes in turn itself a morally-active subject,
   unless indeed it is to cease to be.

I. THE INDIVIDUAL MORAL SUBJECT, MAN.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LIX. Man as a Spirit.

   Man as created after God's image is, as spiritualized nature, both
   spirit and nature, and also the real unity of the two.

   A. As a spirit he is a rationally-free, self-determining being,
   attaining to his full, peculiar reality through free activity. The
   basis and essence of this spirituality is personal self-consciousness.
   Only in so far as man is self-conscious can he be moral, and by virtue
   of this self-consciousness he is answerable for his life,--his life
   becomes to him a moral one, and is counted to him. But he is conscious
   of himself as a personal individual, that is, he distinguishes himself
   from others not merely by his being, but by a to him
   exclusively-peculiar, determined being,--by his peculiar personality,
   which in this peculiarity does not belong to him directly from nature,
   but is acquired only by personal, moral activity, and hence constitutes
   character-peculiarity. The individual being of man is distinguished
   from that of nature-objects by the fact that it has inherent in itself,
   as an inner rational power, the destination not to remain a mere
   individual unit, but to become a personality,--in a word, man is from
   the very beginning not a mere specimen of his species, but is called to
   become a peculiarly-determined being.

   The Christian idea of man is summed up in the thought of the image of
   God, and hence presupposes dogmatically the development of the idea of
   God. The great emphasis which is laid in Scripture on this idea of
   God-likeness [Gen. i, 26, 27; ix, 6; 1 Cor. xi, 7; James iii, 9; Col.
   iii, 10; Acts xvii, 28, 29] shows of itself that we have not to do here
   with a mere poetic figure. All that is created is good,--is an
   expression of the divine will, and hence is an image of the divine
   thought; but the rational creature, as the crown of creation, is the
   most complete expression of this goodness,--is the image of God, bears
   upon itself the most perfect impress of the Creator. Now as God is
   essentially a spirit, hence, man is God's image more immediately only
   as a rational spirit, whereas the body merely bears on itself, like
   other nature-objects, the trace of the Creator, but not his perfect
   impress, and it becomes an image of God only, mediately,--namely, in so
   far as it is progressively transfigured by the spirit into its own
   perfect expression. In the Scriptures Christ is called by pre-eminence,
   the true image of God; but man is called to become like this image
   [Rom. viii, 29]. Christ is this image not merely as the eternal Son of
   God, but also and especially as the true Son of Man, who historically
   and visibly reveals the divine [Col. i, 15]; and as such he is the
   "first-born among many brethren."

   The rational spirit stands in contrast to mere nature-existence. A
   nature-entity determines not itself, but is determined by a
   nature-force not lying within its own consciousness,--is even in its
   activity predominantly unfree, whereas that which constitutes the
   essence of spirit is, to be free, to determine itself in its
   peculiarity, to be active toward conscious ends. The brute has not
   purposes, but only impulses. There is indeed reason in the brute; the
   brute does not, however, have the reason, but the reason has the brute.
   The reason that is in nature is only objective rationality; whereas
   spirit is a subject possessing reason as a consciousness. This
   consciousness is rational, however, only as self-consciousness, wherein
   man becomes to himself a real object,--comes into spiritual
   self-possession, and in this self-possession distinguishes himself from
   all other objective beings. By virtue of self-consciousness man remains
   ever in the presence of himself, and at one with himself; and only in
   virtue of this continuous sameness of the personal spirit, is it
   morally responsible.

   But a spirit is more than a mere numerical individual; nature-creatures
   differ from others of their species, not by essential peculiarities but
   by their mere separate being and by outward fortuitous
   determinations,--are mere essentially-similar specimens of the same
   kind, mere repetitions of the same existence. But each individual
   personal spirit has, as distinguished from other personal spirits, a
   determined peculiarity of its own, which raises it from a mere
   numerical existence into a determined personality. In
   self-consciousness man knows himself not merely as a man, but as this
   particularly-determined man. He bears, therefore, a personal name, the
   significance of which is, that it is his destination to be something
   different from others,--to possess in his being something which others
   neither have nor can have in the same manner. The name is, with man as
   well as with God, an expression of personal peculiarity--of that which
   inwardly distinguishes one determined personality from others [Exod.
   xxxiii, 12, 17; Isa. xliii, 1; xlv, 3, 4; lvi, 5; John x, 3; Rev. iii,
   5]; this personal peculiarity the spirit does not have from nature, nor
   yet is it generated by merely natural development; but the child has
   from the very beginning the capacity for, and hence the destination
   unto, such a personality-constituting peculiarity; nor is this capacity
   a merely conceived possibility, on the contrary it is a real germ; but
   this germ can come to development only by moral activity. This germ of
   personality which lies in the very essence of the rational spirit does
   not contain within itself the determined peculiarity; it simply
   requires development, but as to how, and unto what peculiarity it
   becomes developed, that depends on the free moral activity of the
   person himself. That this personal peculiarity does not come from
   nature, but belongs to the life of the free spirit, is clearly implied
   in the custom, prevalent among almost all nations and tribes, of
   name-giving. Nature gives to man at birth his individual existence; the
   spiritually and historically formed society, or family, gives to him
   his personal name,--designating thereby either the goal of this
   personality or its already acquired peculiarity [Gen. iii, 20; iv, 25;
   v, 29; xxi, 3; xli, 51, 52; Matt. i, 25; Luke i, 60, etc.].

   This thought of the moral quality of the personality is not so
   uncontested as might be supposed. Schleiermacher, in his Philosophical
   Ethics, [4] holds that moral individualities differ primitively, before
   all moral activity, and hence do not merely become different. While
   preceding moral systems, and especially that of Kant, either overlooked
   the special peculiarity of the person, or even ignored it as something
   illegitimate, Schleiermacher emphasizes justly enough the moral
   significancy of this peculiarity, but lie also rushes to the opposite
   one-sidedness, and magnifies the difference into a primitive,
   determined, ante-moral one,--a sort of moral atomistics, which, in
   order to escape the difficulty of the notion of free
   self-determination, assumes a much greater incomprehensibility. In a
   system, sprung up from essentially Pantheistic soil, this view is not
   inconsequential, inasmuch as here the notion of a really free
   self-determination is out of the question; but at the same time also
   the notion of moral personality is precluded, and ethics is reduced to
   a presentation, not of how man as a free individual should conform
   himself to a moral idea, but of how he must develop himself in his
   strictly naturally-determined idiosyncrasy. But a spirit that is
   absolutely determined by the All (conceived here as strictly
   impersonal) could not essentially differ from a mere nature-creature;
   even brutes have unfree spirituality. We admit that men, even had they
   not sinned, would not have manifested perfect similarity, but would
   have been in some respects differently attuned from nature itself,--as,
   for example, in the peculiarities of sex, of temperament and of
   nationality, (see § 67,) but these natural differences affect not the
   personal essence itself,--do not make of the individual a being
   strictly personally-different from all others, but are only different
   traits of entire clans or groups,--are not so much differences of
   individuals as of races. The fact that in the present condition of
   mankind, each individual has inborn within him the germ of determined
   moral peculiarities, of particular vices and the like, is simply a
   result of his illegitimate abnormal state, and is very far from
   justifying us in merely cultivating and developing our inborn
   peculiarities. But Schleiermacher is very erroneous when he regards
   this original difference, even in spiritual and moral respects, as
   something necessary and contributive to the aesthetic beauty of the
   All,--as, for example, when he says: "Some [of the phases of humanity]
   are the most sublime and striking expression of the beautiful and the
   divine; others are grotesque products of the most original and fleeting
   whim of a master-hand; . . . why should we despise that which throws
   into relief the chief groups, and gives life and fullness to the whole?
   Is it not befitting that the single heavenly forms should be glorified
   by the fact that thousands of others bow themselves before them?
   Undying humanity is unweariedly busy in reproducing itself and in
   manifesting itself under the greatest variety of manner in the
   transitory phenomena of finite life. Such is the harmony of the
   universe, such the great and wonderful simplicity in its eternal
   art-work. What indeed were the monotonous reiteration of a beau ideal
   in which, after all, the individuals would be (time and circumstances
   substracted) strictly like each other-the same formula with the
   coefficients varied?--what were such a monotony in comparison with this
   infinite variety of human peculiarities? . . . This individual appears
   as the rude animal part of humanity, affected only by the first
   infantile instincts of the race; that other one, as the finest
   sublimated spirit, free from all that is common and unworthy, and with
   light wing rising above the earth;--but all are there in order to show,
   by their existence, how the various forces of human nature operate
   separately and in detail." (Reden, 2 ed., p. 130 sqq.). Such language
   outdoes even the Greek distinction of man into barbarous and free-men,
   and is, as a consistent expression of a purely naturalistic view of the
   world, in most direct antagonism to the Christian thought of a moral
   world-order upheld by a holy God.--Rothe (Ethik i, § 120 sqq.) adopts
   the view of Schleiermacher in a somewhat different, though less
   consistent form.

    SECTION LX. The Cognizing Spirit.

   The self-conscious personality unfolds its life under a variety of
   forms.--(1) Man is a knowing, a cognoscitive, spirit,--he takes objects
   spiritually, that is, according to their idea, into himself, and thus
   makes them his enduring possession. The object of knowledge is truth,
   and the knowing spirit is capable of attaining thereto. Knowledge is in
   itself true and does not deceive, for God's created universe is good,
   and hence true and in perfect harmony with itself. As a rational
   spirit, man knows not only the created world but also its divine
   source,--in fact the essence of rationality consists in the knowledge
   of God in his existence, his nature, his government, and his will. This
   God-consciousness, resting upon a self-revelation of God to man, is
   indeed, as finite knowledge, not capable of thoroughly comprehending
   the infinite essence of God, yet, with a full consciousness of its own
   limits, it is nevertheless a true, real, and well-grounded knowledge of
   the divine, and as such it is the presupposition of morality.

   The human spirit is an image of the eternal divine life, though in the
   form of a temporal life. God, in his eternal life, is eternally
   self-begetting, self-knowing, and self-loving,--absolutely his own
   object; and the finite spirit, reflectively manifesting the
   life-development of God, has a threefold object upon which its
   life-movement is directed, namely, itself, the external world and God.
   Man is God's image in this threefold relation,--in willing, in knowing,
   and in feeling; but as, primarily, his reality is given to him, as
   already existing without his co-operation, hence these three activities
   appear in another and chronologically different order of succession, as
   knowing, feeling, and willing. Thus the finite spirit knows (takes
   cognizance of), feels (loves) and wills both itself, the objective
   world and God; and, as the life of a created being is a progressive
   development whose spiritual significance lies before it as a goal or
   purpose,--as something not as yet fully real, but rather as to be won
   by effort,--hence the threefold life of the spirit has also a threefold
   end, namely, truth, happiness, and the good; and it is only in the
   perfect attaining of this threefold end that the image of God in man
   perfects itself,--that the highest good is realized. But as the
   perfection of created things consists in the fact that they perfectly
   correspond to the divine creative idea, so the perfection of knowledge,
   feeling, and willing, and consequently of truth, of happiness, and of
   the good, consists in their so relating to God that all finite objects
   are known, willed, and loved only in God and as relating to him. God
   himself is the truth, the good and love, and whatever falls under this
   threefold notion, does so only in so far as it is rooted in and in
   harmony with God.

   Man, as created good by God, must have the capacity perfectly to attain
   to this good state which is divinely proposed to him as his life-goal.
   Hence his knowledge cannot be deceptive, but must have the truth as its
   contents. The world would not be good, would not be in harmony, if the
   intellectual images of objects in the knowing spirit were not true to
   the originals,--if the thought as objectively real were essentially
   other than the subjective one. What Christ promises to his followers:
   "Ye shall know the truth" [John viii, 32], must also be fully
   applicable to man per se; redemption is in fact essentially a
   restoration of the lost perfection; God wills that all men should "come
   unto the knowledge of the truth" [1 Tim. ii, 4]. The destination of man
   to know the truth is expressed in Gen. ii, 19, 20. God brought the
   beasts to Adam in order "to see what he would call them," that is, how
   he would distinguish them from himself and from other objects,--form of
   them a definite, generically-characterizing notion; the name is an
   expression of the obtained notion;--and whatsoever he severally called
   them, "that was the name thereof;"--this is not a mere experiment on
   the part of God, but, on the contrary, a divine guaranty for the
   truthfulness of human knowledge, and at the same time for the freedom
   of the same. God himself brings before man the outer world; thereby he
   guarantees to him that his knowledge is legitimate, true, and reliable;
   and it is not God who gives names to the objects; man himself does it,
   and freely; the knowing (taking cognizance) of the truth is a free, and
   hence a moral activity; and this calling by name, this definite,
   distinguishing knowing, is sealed by God as truthful,--"that was the
   name thereof;" man's free knowing is not to be mere empty play, but to
   have a reality as its contents; and the spiritual significance of
   things is to find its goal only in its being spiritually appropriated
   by man. Our knowledge of the objective world is not to remain a mere
   sensuous beholding, as with the brute, but is to rise beyond that stage
   into the sphere of ideas; this is for us a moral duty, and one which
   has a divine promise. Thus the first man takes cognizance of, and
   names, also the woman, his created helpmeet [Gen. ii, 23]; and Eve, as
   well as Adam, recognizes the divine will and distinguishes it from her
   own as owing obedience to the former [Gen. iii, 2, 3]; in the one case
   as well as in the other, there is manifested at the same time a
   definite self-consciousness as different from the objective
   consciousness.

   The relation of our knowledge to God is of course quite different from
   its relation to the world. While all worldly being may, as created, be
   also ultimately fully known and comprehended by man, on the contrary
   the infinite and eternal being and essence of God is, for the
   essentially limited human spirit, a thought never fully to be grasped;
   and the incomprehensibility of God [Psa. cxlvii, 5; Isa. xl, 28; lv, 8,
   9; Job xi, 8; Rom. xi, 33] is a Christian doctrine by no means to be
   rejected. But this incomprehensibility does not preclude a very
   essential and true knowledge, otherwise were all Godlikeness in man a
   mere empty rhetorical phrase. Even as the eye is unable to take in the
   entire ocean, and nevertheless has a very definite intuition of its
   existence and peculiarities, so likewise is the finite spirit unable to
   take in the infinite, to fathom it in its bottomless depths, and yet it
   is able with constantly increasing clearness to attain to a true
   knowledge not only of the existence but also of the nature of
   God,--not, however, by means of the understanding, which relates to and
   is exclusively occupied with the finite, but by means of the reason,
   which relates essentially to the infinite. As all created being is a
   reflection of God, and as man is his image, hence the type leads
   directly to an (imperfect it may be, but yet) true knowledge of the
   prototype [Rom. i, 19, 20; Col. iii, 10]. The assumption that man can
   know of God only that he is, and what he is not, but not what he is, is
   self-contradictory and unbiblical; a merely negative knowledge is no
   knowledge at all, and of that of whose nature I know nothing I cannot
   affirm even, that it is. The Evangelical Church very strongly
   emphasizes primitive man's capability of attaining to a knowledge of
   the truth, even in relation to the divine nature; the Apologia (i, §
   17, 18) ascribes to him sapientia et notitia dei certior, "a correct
   and clear knowledge of God." Skepticism may readily find excuse for
   itself outside of Christianity, but what holds good of man as estranged
   from God, does not hold equally of him who is in communion with that
   God who is himself the truth; and hence within the Christian world,
   skepticism has no longer any reason of existence. Also the assertion of
   Kant, that the object per se remains hidden from human knowledge, and
   that all knowledge of reality has, in the sphere of pure reason, only a
   formal and subjective validity, is in direct contradiction to the
   Christian world-view, which expresses a much greater confidence in the
   harmony of the universe. The perfect man and the Christian can do more
   than "conjecture and presume;" for, "the spirit of man is the candle of
   the Lord" [Prov. xx, 27].--That man's first God-consciousness should
   rest on an objective self-revelation of God, was a necessary condition
   to his spiritual education toward finding the truth for himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXI. The Volitionating Spirit, Freedom of Will.

   (2) Man is a willing, a volitionating, spirit; the goal of his
   life-movement is for him a conscious end. He is not impelled
   unconsciously and by extraneous force toward that to which he is to
   attain, but he knows the end, and himself directs himself toward
   it,--he chooses the known goal by virtue of a personal
   will-determination,--that is, in his willing he is free. The end of
   rational willing is the good, and, in so far as this is to be realized
   by freedom, the morally-good. That which in nature-objects takes place
   by necessity, becomes, in the sphere of the moral will, a "should;"
   that which in the former case is natural law, becomes here a moral
   precept; that which is there natural development, becomes here moral
   life. But the will of the created spirit differs from the prototypal
   will of God by the fact that its development in time is not
   unconditioned, but is always conditioned on free self-determination, so
   that consequently there exists the possibility of another
   self-determination than that toward the true end,--that is, in a word,
   by the fact that man's freedom of will, as distinguished from the
   divine (which is, at the same time, eternal necessity), is freedom of
   choice--liberum arbitrium. The finite spirit can, and should, attain to
   the good as the purpose of its life, but it can also--what it should
   not do--turn away from this good; and it attains to the good only when
   it freely wills to attain to it. Man, as created good, has this freedom
   in the highest degree, so that it is not limited or trammeled by any
   tendency to evil inherent in his natural non-perfection, as, for
   example, by his sensuousness. It is incumbent upon ethics to describe
   and explain the development of the natural freedom of the, as yet,
   undetermined will, into the moral freedom of the holy will.

   The moral freedom of the will is distinctly presupposed in the Biblical
   account of primitive man. "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying,
   Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of
   the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it" [Gen. ii, 16,
   17]. God's injunction addresses itself to the free will of man, and
   requires of him moral obedience. When, now, man nevertheless actually
   did that which was forbidden, he simply did the opposite of what God's
   holy will was; and he thereby demonstrated in fact, though to his ruin,
   the reality of human freedom of choice. Scripture knows absolutely
   nothing of any other view of the true nature of man than that he was
   capable of freely choosing good or evil. For this idea of freedom of
   choice, however, Scripture has no specific expression; for eleutheros,
   eleutheria, originally used in a legal sense, designate the condition
   of mall as emancipated by Christ; the idea of man's freedom of choice
   is expressed rather as a "choosing between good and evil;" for example,
   in Isa. vii, 15, 16, where the time of the spiritual maturity of a man
   is called the time when he "shall know to refuse the evil and choose
   the good" [comp. Deut. xi, 26 sqq.], or when he can do "according to
   his pleasure" [Esth. i, 8], or that which is "good in his own eyes"
   [Gen. xvi, 6; xix, 8]. The view of freedom of choice as presented in
   the book of Sirach xv, 14, holds good in its full sense evidently only
   of man as free from the bondage of sin. In the New Testament, man's
   freedom of choice is implied by thelein (for example, in Matt. xxiii,
   37; whereas the "power over one's own will" mentioned in 1 Cor. vii, 37
   refers more to our moral discretion).

   In the Christian church the full moral freedom of choice of man before
   the fall, has been uniformly admitted; and the notion that human
   actions are necessarily determined, just as uniformly rejected [comp.
   Apol. i, p. 52, 53; Form. Conc. ii, p. 580, 677]. The "supralapsarian"
   predestinarianism of Calvin has never been ecclesiastically sanctioned,
   nor in fact does even it deny freedom of choice as a principle, and
   expressly, but only actually. Entirely different from this teaching of
   Calvin is the fundamental denial of freedom of will in all Pantheistic
   systems since Spinoza. In Pantheism there is no place for freedom, and
   what appears there under this name is something entirely different from
   that which the consciousness of all nations understands thereby. Where
   conscious spirit is not the ground, but simply a product of the
   collective development of the All, there the individual spirit is in
   its entire existence, essence, and life, absolutely determined; and its
   single life-manifestations are quite as absolutely determined as is its
   being itself;--in which case the rational spirit can never have a
   consciousness of freedom, but only a "sense of absolute dependence,"
   and hence there can be no room for any moral responsibility. The
   seemingly moral life is as immediate and necessary a manifestation of
   the "all-life" as is the growth of plants, and it differs from the
   nature-life only in the fact, that man has a consciousness of that
   which he does necessarily, in fact, but which he fancies he does
   freely. The will differs from unconscious nature-impulse only by the
   consciousness which attends it, but it is, in fact, quite as absolutely
   determined and unfree as is the latter. This view is expressed most
   clearly, simply, and consequentially, by Spinoza; and it is neither in
   the interest of clearness nor of scientific honesty, when more recent
   systems, based on him, make free use of fair-sounding words about human
   freedom. In essential agreement with Spinoza, Schleiermacher, in his
   "Discourses on Religion," rejects the freedom of the will. The essence
   of religion is a sense of the absolute unity of the universe and the
   individual existence,--a consciousness that our whole being and
   activity are the being and activity of the universe itself, and are
   determined thereby.--Schelling, who subsequently attributed to the idea
   of the personal will a very high significancy, held as yet in his
   "Lectures on Academic Study" (1803) to the unconditional necessity of
   all apparently free phenomena. History is quite as fully an immediate
   and necessary manifestation of the absolute, as is nature; men are but
   instruments for carrying out that which is per se necessary, and they
   are, in their reality and peculiarities, quite as fatally-determined as
   the actions themselves. Actions appear as free or arbitrary only in so
   far as man makes a necessarily-determined action specifically his own,
   but this action itself, as well as its result in good or evil, and
   hence also man in all his life-manifestations, is but the passive
   instrument of absolute necessity; all that which is apparently free is
   but a necessary expression of the eternal order of things. Subsequently
   (1809), Schelling sought to rise above Pantheism, and, in some manner,
   to comprehend the freedom of the will, but he did not rise beyond
   wide-reaching contradictions. The assumption of an ante-mundane fall
   into sin was intended to reconcile freedom with necessity (Phil. Schr.,
   1809, i, 438 sqq., 463 sqq.). On this we remark here simply, that from
   an ethical stand-point it makes no moral difference whether free
   self-determination is precluded, for our whole mundane life, by an
   absolute natural necessity, or by a pretended ante-mundane free
   determination of man himself, but of which he has not the least
   consciousness. Where there is no continuity of the consciousness, there
   is also no unity of the person; and a pretended free act which I am
   supposed to have done, but of which I know absolutely nothing, is not
   my act but is absolutely foreign to me; and a fettering of my freedom,
   by a, to me entirely unknown, timeless act cannot be regarded from a
   moral point of view as other than a simple being-determined by
   unconditional necessity.--Hegel has left the idea of freedom, in many
   respects, in great uncertainty; he is very fond of talking of freedom;
   but his system itself is compatible only with a universal
   all-determining necessity; freedom is nothing more than "the not being
   dependent on another, the sustaining relations to one's self;" in its
   full sense, however, this is true only of the spirit as absolute;
   individual spirits are only transient manifestations of the collective
   life, and are determined by the same.--More recent philosophy, wherever
   it deviates from strict Pantheism, uniformly attempts to bring personal
   freedom of will more clearly before the consciousness. There is here no
   possibility of a middle-ground, and ambiguous rhetoric can no longer
   deceive. Where God is not the infinite eternal Spirit, but comes to
   self-consciousness only in man, there the thought of a real freedom of
   will is impossible. The infinite domination of the All leaves no place
   for the free movement of the individual spirit; the misused freedom of
   a single creature would throw the collective universe into disorder,
   for the unfree All affords no possibility of preserving moral order as
   against the free actions of individuals. On this ground there remains a
   freedom only for thoughtless contemplation; and this would then, of
   necessity, lead to the ethics of an unlimited self-love which can seek
   and find in the bedlam of individual wills nothing higher than itself.
   Freedom is possible only where a free Spirit rules in and over the All.
   The personal God is able, in almighty love, to create free spirits, and
   to guarantee them in their freedom, namely, in that he lovingly
   withdraws his direct activity from the sphere of will-freedom, and thus
   preserves the created spirit in its spiritual essence which is freedom
   itself; and such a God is able in the midst of the diversity and
   multiplicity of free actions, and even of ungodly ones, to preserve the
   moral order of the universe.

   (The question of freedom of will has of late been much discussed,
   mostly from the stand-point of recent philosophy and in relation
   thereto. Daub: Statement and Criticism of Hypotheses Relating to
   Free-Will, 1834; Romang: On Free-Will and Determinism, 1835 [starting
   out from Schleiermacher's stand-point, he attains only to a semblance
   of freedom]; Matthias: The Idea of Freedom, 1834; [since Hegel]
   Herbart: On the Doctrine of the Freedom of the Human Will, 1836
   [critical, rather than furnishing new matter]; Vatke; Passavant: On the
   Freedom of the Will, 1835; K. Ph. Fischer, in Fichte's Zeitschrift,
   iii, 101; ix, 79; Zeller, in the Theologische Jahrbücher, 1846; and
   others).

    SECTION LXII. The Feeling Spirit.

   (3) Man is a feeling, a sensitive, spirit,--becomes conscious of
   himself as standing in harmony with, or in antagonist to, other being;
   and, inasmuch as in the primitive unperverted creation, goodness, and
   hence harmony, is an essential quality, and a real disharmony therein
   inconceivable, hence while man--as self-developing, that is, as seeking
   after an, as yet, unrealized goal--has a consciousness of something yet
   lacking to his ultimate perfection, still he knows nothing of any real
   antagonism of existence, and hence he has no feeling of pain, but only
   of joy in existence, arising from his consciousness of an undisturbed
   harmony of universal existence with his own. personality,--that is, in
   a word, the feeling of happiness. In so far as this feeling expresses
   at the same time the recognition of this existence in its peculiar
   reality, it is love. Bliss and love to God and to his works are not two
   different things, but only two different phases of the same spiritual
   life-manifestation,--the former being rather the subjective, the latter
   the objective phase,--inasmuch as in bliss and love man is, in fact,
   perfectly at one with the objective universe.

   Feeling is not peculiar to the rational spirit; it becomes rational
   only in so far as it is an expression of self-consciousness; and as
   self-consciousness is rational only in being a consciousness not of
   mere individual being but also of a Godlikeness in the peculiarity of
   the person, so also is rational feeling not of a merely individual
   nature, but it is excited by the traces of God which shine forth from
   all created existence, and hence it is, at bottom, always a love of
   God. The goodness of created existence is embraced by rational feeling
   not as being good merely for the feeling individual, but as a
   being-good per se; the rational spirit feels not merely that this or
   that entity stands in harmony with itself, but it feels itself as
   standing in harmony with the totality of existence,--feels the harmony
   of God's world as such. In the same degree that spirituality rises,
   rises also the vividness and compass of feeling. The unconscious
   nature-object is affected only by the very few things that come into
   immediate contact with it; the brute shows so much the more extended
   and more lively a sympathy with external existence the higher and
   nobler its rank. Emotionlessness, blunt indifference toward external
   objects, is always, save where it is artificially superinduced by false
   teachings, a sign of deep moral degradation. The Biblical account of
   the primitive condition of man uniformly represents the destination of
   nature to be, to procure to the rational spirit the feeling of joy, of
   happiness. Man is placed in the garden of Eden, and thereby brought
   into the immediate presence of the full harmony of the created. world;
   in it God causes to grow "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and
   good for food;" and the full feeling of happiness, as springing from
   his love to that which harmonizes with him, is procured to man (to whom
   it is not "good" to be alone) by the creation of woman,--in whom he at
   once recognizes that she is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh,--a
   being other than, and yet of, himself.

   Feeling is the presupposition of all activity, and hence also of the
   moral; and the most real feeling of all--that which relates to the
   moral-is not an un-pleasure feeling,--as is often assumed in antagonism
   to the Biblical world-view, but in fact a happiness-feeling. It would
   not imply a "good" creation, nor indeed any God-likeness in man, were
   it a fact that man were incited to activity only by un-pleasure, that
   is, by pain, while yet happiness were the end of the active life. Even
   as God is not prompted to activity by any feeling of want, but rather
   in virtue of his eternal and absolutely perfect bliss, so also can the
   true moral feeling of man, who is God's image, be no other than the
   feeling of happiness and love; but the consciousness of a yet to be won
   good is per se by no means a feeling of unhappiness, on the contrary it
   in fact awakens a direct pleasure in seeking.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXIII. The Immortal Spirit.

   (4) Man, as a rationally self-conscious spirit, is personally immortal;
   only as such is he a truly moral being,--has a moral life-task
   transcending his own immediate individuality. Faith in immortality is
   the presupposition of true morality; for the moral life-task is one
   that is incessantly progressive, ever self-renewing, and at no moment
   perfectly brought to a close; and, as the perfect realization of
   Godlikeness, it can only be accomplished through an
   uninterruptedly-continuing personal life.

   We have to do here, not with the scientific demonstration of the
   doctrine of personal immortality, but only with its moral significance.
   In recent times, especially since Kant, the notion has frequently been
   maintained, that morality is entirely independent of a belief in
   immortality, nay, that it evinces its purity and genuineness by the
   very fact of entirely leaving out of view this belief, and that a man
   is not truly moral so long as he allows himself to be determined in his
   moral activity by this belief. It is true, Kant deduces from the idea
   of the moral, the idea of personal immortality as a rational postulate;
   the moral idea itself, however, is with him independent of this
   postulate,--calls for its fulfillment absolutely and unconditionally.
   There is in this some degree of self-contradiction; if the "categorical
   imperative" demands morality unconditionally, and utterly
   irrespectively of immortality, then this immortality cannot be embraced
   in it as a postulate, but must be merely associated thereto from
   without. In the endlessness of the life-task, however, as it is
   presented by Kant, there actually lies, in fact, the thought of
   immortality as included in the moral idea itself,--so that his express
   dissociating of the two ideas is illegitimate and unnatural.
   Schleiermacher goes further; and, even in his Dogmatics, he is unable
   entirely to rise above his previous express denial of immortality. In
   his Discourses on Religion he places the religiously-moral life-task
   proper in an actual disregarding of the idea of this immortality.
   "Strive even in this life to annihilate your personality, and to live
   in the One and All; strive to be more than yourselves, in order that
   you may lose but little when you lose yourselves;" the immortality to
   be aimed at is not that of the personality, not above and beyond the
   earthly existence, but it is an ideal immortality in each and every
   moment; men should not desire to hold fast to their personality, rather
   "should they embrace the single opportunity presented to them by death
   for escaping beyond it." [5] Even in his Dogmatics Schleiermacher
   holds, that the purest morality perfectly consists with a "renunciation
   of the perpetuity of the personality,--that, in fact, an interestedness
   in a recompense is impious. In the Hegelian philosophy morality is
   absolutely independent of immortality; this idea in fact can nowhere
   find footing in the system; the religion of the "this-side" which
   sprang from this philosophy, affects to give point to its rhetorical
   flourishes on morality by its seemingly magnanimous renunciation of all
   expectation of eternal life.

   The pretended disinterestedness of moral actions performed without
   reference. to immortality, is mere appearance. All moral activity looks
   to an end, and this end is a good; and personal perfection is for each
   individual an essential part of the highest good, or, in fact, this
   good itself; hence not to wish to obtain any thing for one's self by
   one's moral activity is simply absurd; the first and most necessary of
   all goods, and the one which is the presupposition of all morality, is
   in fact existence; to desire to renounce personal existence, or to
   regard it as indifferent, is equivalent to renouncing moral life, and
   is consequently not unselfish, but it is immoral. It is true we cannot
   claim for the so-called teleological proof of the immortality of the
   soul, full demonstrative power; this much, however, it does prove,
   namely, that the highest moral perfection would be impossible without
   immortality; for, as man can never arrive at such a perfection of the
   moral life as that he can advance no further, so that consequently his
   farther existence would be purposeless, but in fact, on the contrary,
   every fulfillment of one moral duty gives in turn birth to new ones,
   and there is absolutely no point to be found where the moral spirit
   might say, "thus far and no farther, there remains nothing more for me
   to do," --hence also moral perfection cannot be realized save in an
   unbroken perpetuity of personal life. To say now, that the moral
   life-task does not consist in obtaining entire moral perfection, but
   only a limited degree thereof, would be per se immoral. And in fact
   should we for a moment concede some such limited degree of the moral,
   then there would be no conceivable rule for fixing this degree, and
   each would be at liberty to narrow the limits of his morality at
   pleasure, without that any one would be justified in blaming, or less
   esteeming him therefor.

   In all moral systems, even those of heathen nations, morality is more
   precious than temporal life, and that person is regarded as ignoble and
   contemptible, even by pagans, who clings to his life at any price, for
   example, at that of failing in his duty to his country, to his family,
   or to his own honor. This moral sentiment of honor we have no wish to
   weaken. It is conceivable, on the assumption of the prevalence of sin,
   that one's moral duty, as, for example, that of speaking or confessing
   the truth, or of fidelity in love or obedience, cannot in some
   conjunctures be fulfilled save at the sacrifice of temporal life. Now,
   to one's existence in general one has an unlimited right; it is his
   first and most natural right. In the absence of immortality, however,
   the sacrifice of one's life for a moral duty would not only not be a
   moral requirement, but it would be downright folly and sin; for
   morality can never require the giving up of the first condition of all
   moral activity, namely, personal existence. The first, the most
   immediate and absolutely unconditional duty, is self-preservation, and
   other duties are binding only in so far as they do not radically
   interfere with this one. As it would not be a moral action, but on the
   contrary a proof of insanity if one man should really choose [6]
   eternal damnation for the sake of another, just as little is any being
   whatever at liberty to purchase for others any temporal good, however
   great, at the cost of personal existence; and in the absence of
   immortality there can be none other than temporal goods. Man may
   sacrifice any one good only for the sake of a higher good; but in
   renouncing existence he obtains no good whatever. The sound and
   unsophisticated judgment will find, on the denial of immortality, no
   other rule of life-wisdom than simply to take advantage of the short
   span of life here allotted to us for enjoying the greatest possible
   happiness. Happiness is in fact an absolutely necessary phase of human
   perfection, and an essential expression of the highest good; to strive
   after it is not only not selfishness, on the contrary, it is a
   requirement of reason and of moral duty; and it is not possible that in
   a world of rational order morality should work any thing else than
   happiness. Were it otherwise it would be a plain proof of the
   non-existence of a rational, moral world-order, and in that case it
   would be totally absurd to speak further of moral duty at all, for duty
   is itself a part of a moral world-order. If there is, now, no eternal
   blessedness as a highest good, then it can be only after temporal,
   earthly happiness, that man has to seek, and by which consequently he
   is to measure the morality of his acts. If it is true that all morality
   necessarily renders happy, then on the above hypothesis only that can
   be moral which procures for us earthly comfort, temporal enjoyment; the
   teachings of the Epicureans would then be the only rational theory, and
   no valid objection could be made to the moral rule: "Let us eat and
   drink, for to-morrow we die" [1 Cor. xv, 32]. Foolish then would he be
   who did not recklessly seek as much enjoyment in his earthly life as in
   any way he possibly could. It is, of course, not necessary that this
   system should lead simply to groveling sensual enjoyment; the ancient
   Epicureans knew well enough that riotous intemperate indulgence works
   much suffering, and the modern ones also know equally well, that by
   unrestrained wantonness they bring themselves into shame and contempt
   in the eyes of the morally-taught masses; this, however, does not in
   any degree ameliorate the essence of this morality of the "this side."
   The outwardly-respectable life of many a denier of immortality rests in
   reality on the power of public opinion, and on custom as grown up from
   Christian ground. But the case is quite otherwise where unbelief
   becomes fashionable in wider circles of society. Let vouch for this,
   the utter immorality and depravity that prevailed in the circles of the
   French and of the Gallicized German free-thinkers of the last century.
   In the lower walks of society where a simpler logic prevails, and where
   respect for position and for public opinion has a less controlling
   power, the practical inferences from a naturalistic philosophy are more
   speedily and consistently drawn; and the ringleaders in depravity among
   the lower classes of the present day are, for the most part, deeply
   imbued with the conquests of "free thought," and are able thereby
   admirably to justify their wantonness; and there is scarcely
   conceivable a more absurd rôle than that assumed by the "respectable"
   among the free-thinkers, who presume to preach morality to their more
   free-thinking and more logically reasoning brethren.

   He who is without belief in immortality cannot act from an
   unconditional moral idea, but only from empirical external fitness,
   from circumstantial need; he cannot make moral duty his life-task, and
   his moral life sinks to a merely higher-cultured animal life. The
   question as to whether Christian morality is possible without a belief
   in immortality would have to be rejected as trivial,--seeing that a
   belief in Christ's and God's express word is certainly included in
   Christian morality,--had it not been expressly affirmed by some. The
   word of Christ, however, is a sufficient answer. "He that loseth his
   life for my sake shall find it," and "He that loveth his life shall
   lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto
   life eternal" [Matt. x, 39; Luke ix, 24; xvii, 33; John xii, 25; x, 17;
   comp. 1 Cor. ix, 25; Phil. i, 21]. We emphasize in these passages, not
   the expressly pronounced affirmation of a life after death, but simply
   the express requirement to sacrifice one's life in the interest of a
   moral duty. But a world-government in which the realization of the good
   is possible only by the destruction of him who has for his life-task to
   realize the good, would be per se in a state of utter anarchy, and
   would have no right to impose moral duties. The simple undeniable fact
   is this, that the Christian heroes who literally fulfilled the above
   word of Christ, had joy in so doing only because of that living faith
   that enabled them to pray amid the tortures of death: "Lord Jesus,
   receive my spirit" [Acts vii, 59]. But between the Christian martyr's
   joy in death and an unbeliever's defiant contempt of death, there is a
   world-wide difference. Cases are not unfrequently seen of hardened
   criminals and atheists meeting death with undaunted courage and great
   coolness; this is, however, but another form of the cold defiance with
   which other persons blow out their own brains; and whoever has the
   assurance to compare such blind hardness, even in the remotest degree,
   with the joyousness and peace of soul of the Christian, surely shows
   himself utterly incapable of appreciating the true nature of morality.

   When Schleiermacher and others, after him, declare it as unpious to be
   interested in a recompense,--understanding by this assertion that there
   is wanting a pure and immediate seeking for piety and morality
   themselves, and that both are desired merely as means for attaining to
   perfect happiness in a future life,--there is indeed some ground for
   their position, but only in so far as the subject should regard
   morality merely as a means to happiness, and that too as a meritorious
   means even in our present state of sinfulness, while the happiness
   should be considered as a justly claimable reward. But so soon as the
   objectors presume to reprehend the seeking after happiness as an
   essential and necessary phase of the highest good, and to brand as
   unpious the striving after the same as an actual life-purpose in
   general, we must reject their position as one-sided and untrue. Every
   good and hence every moral end produces happiness; and it would be a
   strange requirement, to permit the seeking after the good but not the
   seeking after the happiness therein contained. When Christ and the
   Apostles hesitated not to base all moral sacrifice on the promise and
   confident hope of eternal life, it does not seem very becoming in a
   Christian to stigmatize this as immoral self-seeking. When appeal is
   made to the Reformed divine Danaeus, who (in his Ethica Christ. i, c.
   17) represents the honor of God as the sole motive, and that for the
   sake of which we should be in duty bound to take upon ourselves eternal
   death, were it required of us, and who stigmatizes it as mercenary to
   act morally for the sake of eternal happiness,--we may reply, on the
   one hand, that it could never occur to one who is a Christian and
   conscious of redemption by grace to regard eternal blessedness, as a
   reward due for his virtue-merit,--which, in fact, is the sole view that
   Danaeus rejects [fol. 78, ed. 3],--and, on the other hand, that this
   somewhat rash and readily misunderstood declaration has quite a
   different sense in the mouth of Danaeus, who held fast to personal
   immortality, and in the mouth of those who see in the thought of
   immortality only a "dogma" without significance for the religious life,
   and which it is well to vail as much as possible in ambiguous
   phraseology. And in fact it doubtless forms a part of the moral
   honoring of God, that we believe in his promises, and love and thank
   him for them, and also act piously from this loving thankfulness. For
   the moral life is genuine only when it is a full and true expression of
   the filial relation of man to God; and it is not only illegitimate, but
   also a sinful disregarding of God, to require that we should keep only
   one phase of this relation in view, and violently throw aside and
   forget the other,--that we should see in God only the Sovereign and not
   also the lovingly promising Father. If God has gifted man with
   immortality, if he has promised to the Christian eternal life, then
   neither can nor should man, as moral, have any other moral goal than
   that which answers to this promise; if man, in his moral life, ignores
   that this life is the way to eternal life,--that God has placed before
   him an everlasting goal,--such conduct is an immoral rejecting of God's
   love. Whoever does not act from love acts immorally; now, for the
   promise of eternal life we owe God thankful love; hence there is no
   true morality which has not this loving thankfulness for its motive.

   Against this view,--which is surely in perfect harmony with the general
   Christian consciousness,--indignant warning has been made, [7] as if it
   were an ignoring of the inalienable "conquests of recent science," and
   even appeal has been made to the Old Testament, in which, as an actual
   fact, it is asserted, the doctrine of immortality is not presented as a
   moral motive. Now, if the conquests of modern science are to consist in
   going back to the Old Testament stand-point, for which, on other
   occasions, the objectors are not in the habit of showing any very high
   esteem, we may well allow ourselves to deem it a progress beyond said
   conquests, to come back to the stand-point of Christ and the Apostles.
   What the wise educative purpose of the said Old Testament peculiarity
   was, we have elsewhere inquired, and we do not hesitate in the least to
   claim that Christian morality stands higher than that of the Old
   Testament, and that also in moral respects "he that is least in the
   kingdom of heaven is greater" than the greatest of the Old Testament
   saints [Matt. xi, 11], though indeed the latter also had, in their
   faith in the divine promise, in their hope of a future glorious goal
   for all the children of God, a powerful moral motive that was in no
   wise opposed to a belief in immortality, but on the contrary implicitly
   contained it. Whether those who in recent times decline, with such
   professed disinterestedness, the application of faith in immortality as
   a moral motive, seek their moral glory in quite as unconditional a
   submission to God's revealed Word and guidance as did the saints of the
   Old Testament, seems to us, after all, quite questionable. We do not
   doubt but that there may be some sort of morality without said faith;
   but the question is as to true morality--that which embraces the whole
   man, appropriates to itself all truth, and is of the truth. The pains
   which some persons give themselves to prove that there may be a moral
   life without faith in immortality, reminds us very much of the recently
   made experiment of a naturalist:--he scooped out with a spoon the brain
   of a living dove, and the poor bird actually continued to live for six
   several weeks, and even partook of food in the mean time! Very
   interesting experiments may be had by performing similar amputations on
   the living body of the Christian faith,--and some of our theologians
   are quite busy at the work,--but whether the patient prospers very well
   under the operation is another question.

  B.--MAN AS TO HIS SENSUOUSLY-CORPOREAL LIFE.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXIV.

   The natural body, as the physical basis on which the spirit develops
   itself to its full reality, has not a purpose in and of itself; but
   only for the spirit, namely, to be the perfectly-answering and
   absolutely-subserving organ of the spirit's relations to nature. This
   embraces three points:--1. The sensuous corporeality is, despite its
   seemingly trammeling power over the freedom of the spirit, per se
   absolutely good, and there is neither any thing evil in it nor is it
   the cause of any evil whatsoever; and as the body must, in so far as it
   is normal, be in harmony with the spirit and with nature, hence there
   is in it no sort of ground for any trammeling of the spiritual
   life--for any pain.

   The moral significance of the sensuous nature, the corporeality, of man
   is a very important point in the Christian world-theory, and can in no
   wise be regarded as non-essential. It is, in fact, one among the living
   questions of the day,--questions which are being warmly agitated even
   outside of the church, and in relation to which the bearing of the
   Christian consciousness is, in many respects, entirely misunderstood.
   As early as the fourth century there infected the Christian church
   (partly under the prompting, or at least the countenance of
   non-Christian influences) a spiritualistic view of the
   naturally-sensuous,--a practical disesteeming of the same in comparison
   with the spiritual; and the Middle Ages followed in general the same
   tendency; the Reformation returned to the primitive Christian and
   biblical view. The recent rationalistic philosophy of the understanding
   developed, in contrast to the Middle Ages, the theoretical rather than
   the practical phase of spiritualism, and conceived the
   sensuously-corporeal life, not merely as the cause of sin, but as per
   se and originally a trammeling of the spiritual life,--as the real
   source and seat of sin, and hence as a mere transitory and soon
   entirely-to-be-thrown-off evil,--and interpreted, utterly erroneously,
   the New Testament term, sarx, referring it to the natural corporeality.
   Death, which had previously been viewed as the wages of sin, was now
   regarded as the emancipator from the seductive and spirit-burdening
   corporeal life,--as the divinely appointed normal beginning of the
   untrammeled life of the spirit. Sensuousness is here the not inherited,
   but innate, and not guilty, but guilt-generating malum originis--an
   evil, the origin of which was not free responsibly-sinning man, but the
   divine creative will itself; in getting rid of corporeality therefore
   man gets rid at the same time also of his (so-regarded)
   scarcely-imputable sinfulness. Sin consists essentially in the
   predominating of the sense-life over the spirit; the spirit per se
   would have little or no occasion for sin. The doctrine of a
   resurrection of a glorified body is rejected as belonging to a crude,
   unspiritual world-view; it is only the pure disembodied spirit that is
   free and perfect. In opposition to this view, the more recent and now
   spreading irreligious Materialism has exalted the sensuously-corporeal
   nature above the spirit, and conceived of the spirit as merely a
   transient force-manifestation of organized matter.

   The evangelically-Christian view is neither the above spiritualistic
   nor this materialistic one. Christianity, though so often charged by
   worldlings with a one-sided spiritualism, places in fact a much higher
   moral worth on the corporeal nature than was ever done by heathenism.
   The body is destined, it is true, to absolute subserviency to the
   spirit; but it has precisely in this, its perfect service, also a share
   in the high moral significancy of the spirit,--it is not only not to be
   discarded as a trammeling of the spirit, but is a very essential part
   of the moral person. As the eye cannot say to the hand: "I have no need
   of thee" [1 Cor. xii, 21], neither also may the spirit thus speak to
   the body. As the nature-side of man, corporeality mediates the action
   of the spirit upon nature, so that nature becomes thrown open to the
   spirit as an object both of knowledge and of action. The spirit stands
   in living relation not only to spirit, but essentially also to nature,
   and virtualizes also therein its Godlikeness.

   The normal relation of the body to the spirit cannot be directly
   inferred from the present actual state of humanity; for if we assume,
   even preliminarily, the possibility that the moral spirit of the race
   has fallen away from its harmony with God, we yet thereby render it
   unsafe to infer that relation from the present state of things, since
   from the disturbed harmony of man with God follows also the disturbance
   of his harmony with himself, and especially of that between spirit and
   body. The true original relation can be educed only, on the one hand,
   from Scriptural declarations and from the living example of Christ,
   and, on the other, from the Christian idea of creation. The simple fact
   that all that God creates is good, is itself proof that the
   corporeality created for the spirit can neither be a trammeling nor a
   natural source of suffering for the same. Suffering and pain are indeed
   means of educative chastening for man as sinful, but for the unsinful
   their presence would be the reversing of all moral order. In God's
   good-created world, men, were they unfallen, would receive their moral
   training through manifestations of love, without the intervention of
   suffering and pain; to deny this would be to deny either God's love or
   his power.

   The sensuous corporeality in its uncorrupted primitiveness can disturb
   neither the moral life by really immoral appetites, nor the feeling of
   happiness by pains and sickness,--the aequale temperamentum qualitatum
   corporis (equipoise of the qualities of the body) of the Apologia (i,
   17);--in that which was created good there can be no antagonism between
   the life of the spirit and that of the body, nor between the body and
   nature; but every suffering, every pain, is evidence of an antagonism,
   of an evil in its subject. In the Scriptures all bodily sufferings are
   expressly traced back to sin [Gen. iii, 16, 19; Rom. v, 12-21]; this is
   the only possible "theodicy" in regard to human suffering. The body of
   the rational spirit is under the dominion of that spirit, and not under
   that of unspiritual nature; and the spirit is under the power of
   itself, and not under that of a nature-bound body; and it is only such
   a spirit as is free in every respect,--one that is not rendered unfree
   by a hampering corporeality,--that is in a condition to fulfill the
   whole of moral duty. In proportion as the now actually spirit-hampering
   sensuous corporeality is held to be the normal condition, and to answer
   to the divine creative idea, in the same proportion must the moral
   life-task also be lowered. And when Rationalism finds the true freedom
   and moral emancipation of the spirit only in the freeing of the same
   from the body, there is at least this much of truth in the position,
   namely, that it is an admission that the present bondage of the spirit
   under the manifoldly-hampering power of the body is not in harmony with
   the true life of the moral spirit. But whereas the
   evangelically-Christian consciousness refers this antagonism in God's
   world to the guilt of man, Rationalism casts the responsibility for
   this condition (which itself admits to be in contradiction to the moral
   idea) upon God, and thereby, in fact, undermines the Christian idea of
   God, and hence also the unconditional obligatoriness of moral duty.
   Ultra posse nemo obligatur (Obligation does not transcend ability);
   this is an ancient truth valid not only in the sphere of jurisprudence
   but also in that of morality.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXV.

   2. The body mediates the relation of the objective world to the
   personal spirit, through the senses; and this mediation, as being
   established by the divine creative will, is a truthful one. On the
   other hand, the body mediates the active relation of the spirit to the
   objective world, and, in subserving the spirit, it thereby mediates the
   morally-essential dominion of the spirit over nature, and is, hence,
   the necessary and adequate organ of the moral spirit in its relation to
   the external world,--and not that of nature for its dominion over the
   spirit.

   If the created spirit has surety of ability for knowing the truth, this
   of itself implies that the knowledge mediated by the senses must be
   real and true,--that sense-impressions per se do not deceive us. "The
   hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them"
   [Prov. xx, 12]; but God is a God of truth; and the solemn exhortation:
   "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things!"
   [Isa. xl, 26], is at the same time a guarantee of the reliableness of
   the senses. If the senses deceive us, then God deceives us. Just as
   without faith in God there is no morality, so also, without confidence
   in the truthfulness of the divinely established world-order--which of
   course includes the vital relations of creatures to each other--a
   complete morality is impossible. Man cannot be under obligation to be
   truthful, if creation is not so. The matter is therefore not so morally
   indifferent as at first glance it might seem. If God is to be seen in
   his works [Rom. i, 20] then must these works speak truthfully to us. If
   sense-impressions have only subjective truth, then they have none at
   all, and hence no worth whatever,--then we sustain no moral relation to
   the objective world, inasmuch as under such circumstances it would have
   for us no existence. There could then be no further question save of a
   moral duty of man to himself or to God. Skepticism on this point is
   therefore no less anti-moral than impious. Deceptions growing out of
   false judgments as to per se true sense-impressions, must of course not
   be confounded with the deception of sense-impressions themselves; it is
   not the eye that sees the sky touch the earth at the horizon, it is
   only a premature judgment that leads to this deception. Real
   sense-deceptions spring of disease, but disease does not exist in a
   state of moral purity.

   The spirit is to dominate over nature, not directly, however, by a mere
   magic-working will, but by the instrumentality of its own dominated
   body. The destination to this domination is expressed even in the build
   of the human body: erect, with upturned look, with hands planned for
   the most manifold activity, the human body bears upon it the impress as
   well as the reality of dominating power. While Materialism subordinates
   spirit to nature, the Christian worldview subordinates nature to
   spirit; and as the spirit is entirely master over its body, so is it
   likewise master over nature by means of the body. A childish,
   morally-unripe spirit cannot, it is true, dominate nature at the will
   of its irrational whims,--but we speak here only of the rational
   spirit, and in this sphere the words, "the spirit is willing, but the
   flesh is weak," have no application; in normal man the flesh is also
   willing and strong. Even as through the senses nature is open and
   unlocked for the cognizing spirit, so is it also through the bodily
   organs for the volitionating spirit. If the facts seem otherwise in the
   present reality of things, if the body is no longer an absolutely
   obedient medium for the dominion of the spirit over nature, but on the
   contrary is much oftener a mere instrument of nature for her dominating
   over the spirit, this is simply because the right and primitive
   relation has been disturbed, and has given place to the enfeebling
   influence of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXVI.

   3. The incipient limitation of the freedom of the normally
   self-developing spirit by the body in consequence of the dependent
   condition of the latter on external nature, is only the corresponding
   normal expression of the still existing unfreedom of the, as yet,
   unmatured spirit, and is therefore also the protection of the same
   against its own immaturity,--a divinely-intended means of discipline
   for the same. But this primarily limiting relation of the body to the
   spirit is only transient, and is not a real trammeling. The body, while
   following in its own development the growth of the spirit in
   rationality and freedom, passes gradually over from its at first
   predominantly determining and conditioning character to that of being
   predominantly determined and conditioned by the spirit; and in its
   ultimate perfection,--as corresponding to the fall moral maturity of
   the spirit,--it becomes perfectly spirit-imbued and
   spirit-appropriated,--the absolutely subservient organ of the
   emancipated spirit,--becomes a perfectly spiritualized and transfigured
   body, which latter, as being developed by a regular growth out of the
   original unfree nature-body, is conditioned neither on a violent death
   of the nature-body nor is subject itself to death, seeing that it is
   simply the necessary and normal organ of the immortal spirit.

   It would be an injustice in the Creator, and a God-repugnant defect in
   creation, were the essentially free and morally matured spirit bound in
   unfreedom by a per se irrational nature; and the anti-scriptural
   notion, that the rational spirit has been banished into a body, as into
   a prison, in punishment for the sins of a previous life, would then be
   the sole possible justification of the Creator. But the conditional
   unfreedom of the spirit such as we must admit also for the unfallen
   state, namely, that it is limited by the natural alternation of
   sleeping and waking [comp. Gen. ii, 21] by the natural wants of food,
   etc., [comp. Gen. i, 29, 30], is not against but for the spirit. It
   reminds the personal spirit of its belonging to the per se unitary and
   law-governed All, its regulated connection with nature; it protects
   the, as yet, inexperienced spirit from unwise presumption, from
   arbitrary irrational meddling with the divinely-established order of
   the world,--teaches it to submit itself to the divinely-willed and
   ordered laws of existence, teaches it humility, and brings to its
   consciousness its dependence on God's power, thereby impressing upon it
   the lesson that it can attain to true freedom only by a free and
   cheerful self-denial in relation to the will of God. Hunger, e. g., is
   the most powerful stimulus to activity, and hence to the development of
   the spirit, and ever since the entrance of sin into the race there has
   been no other so sure and effectual a means of stirring up the spirit
   out of its slothful indolence [Prov. xvi, 26, in the original]. In the
   present state of man hunger is not only of significance for the
   individual, it is a world-historical power, the first and most
   persistent stimulus to civilization. Unfallen humanity, it is true,
   knows nothing of any hunger-stress, but it knows it as a want requiring
   satisfaction; and it is not a feature of the suffering but of the true
   humanity of Christ, that he also felt hunger.

   That which was a disciplining beginning, however, is not to be
   permanent; but it is not the body, but only the limiting power of the
   same that is to pass away. The view that the body is not a permanent
   condition of the spirit, but only a prison-house destined to
   destruction,--a merely useless burdening incident of the spirit,--is a
   very favorite one, it is true, but it is a very un-Christian one. What
   God does is done well, and he has given the body to the spirit for
   perfect service, and not for a burden and a clog. Of the notion that
   the original body is only a worthless case or husk, to be cast off like
   the chrysalis of the butterfly, the Scriptures know nothing;--the
   dissolving of the earthly house [2 Cor. v, 1] applies only to the body
   of sin and death [Gen. iii, 19];--the body is originally, on the
   contrary, the divinely-established permanent condition of true life,
   though indeed not an absolutely necessary condition of the life of the
   spirit in general. Christ, the perfect man, shows in his own person
   what the human body signifies and is; Christ's resurrection is a stone
   of stumbling for all one-sided spiritualism. Christ lives on, not as a
   mere bodiless spirit, but in his now glorified body, and he will
   transfigure our sin-ruined body that it may be like unto his glorious
   body [Phil. iii, 21]. This transfiguration, though without death--not a
   being unclothed, but a being clothed upon [2 Cor. v, 4]--is the
   original purpose of the body given to the immortal spirit as its
   subservient organ. The spirit's body is in fact, as such, no longer a
   mere nature-object, but, as the exclusive possession of an immortal
   subject, it is also itself raised above the perishableness incident to
   all mere nature-objects.--Death is in the Scriptures uniformly referred
   back to sin; and the great emphasis which the New Testament lays upon
   the resurrection of the body indicates what the original body was to
   have been. If it is the moral destination of the spirit to be free, to
   dominate by reason over the merely natural, then death, as a violent
   interruption of life, comes into direct antagonism with this
   destination; it indicates a complete ascendency of unconscious nature
   over spirit, the impotency of the spirit in the face of nature--a
   condition of the real bondage of spirit to nature. Were this
   wide-reaching antagonism between the actual state and the moral nature
   of the spirit the original condition, and were it included in the
   nature of things or in the creative will itself, then the nerve of all
   morality would be paralyzed, and all moral courage broken. To struggle
   against too great odds is folly; if irrational nature is more powerful
   than the moral spirit, then the latter can rationally take no better
   course than to yield to superior force, and to place its own sensuous
   nature higher than its spiritual.

  C.--THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXVII.

   In virtue of the union of spirit and body into one personality, the
   spirit is manifoldly determined also in its moral life, and it appears
   in consequence under different phases of existence, which occasion also
   correspondingly different manifestations of morality.

   1. The stages of life. The spirit is dependent in its development on
   that of the body, not absolutely, however, but only relatively; the
   development-stages of the moral spirit--which do not entirely coincide
   with those of the body, but only in general and partially run parallel
   therewith--are the following:--(a) The stage of moral minority,
   childhood. Here the body is as yet master over the spirit; the spirit
   is as yet in most things essentially unfree--dependent on outer,
   sensuous, and spiritual influences,--is more guided than
   self-guiding.--(b) The stage of transition to majority,--still wavering
   between freedom and unfreedom; morality appears essentially under the
   form of free obedience toward educators.--(c) The stage of moral
   majority. The person has come into possession of himself,--is actually
   master over himself as regards moral self-determination, is able by his
   moral consciousness to guide himself independently; hence he is fully
   morally responsible, and is in process of developing an independent
   character.--A relapsing of the morally matured into a state of moral
   irresponsibility, a becoming childish, is not conceivable in a normal
   condition of humanity, though here there would doubtless, indeed, be a
   greater turning away from merely earthly things, and a growing
   preoccupation with the supernatural,--in the stage of moral old age.

   The development of a spirit as united with a body, consists in one of
   its phases in the fact that it more and more throws off its primarily
   normal greater dependence on the corporeal life,--that it becomes
   freer, ripens toward maturity. Although we cannot conceive of the first
   created human beings as beginning life in a state of unconscious
   childhood, still the above-mentioned stages of life, seeing that they
   are implied in the very nature of self-development, must hold good, at
   least, of all succeeding generations; and even the first man could not
   appear at once as a perfectly mature, morally-ripened spirit, but had
   to pass through similar stages of development. According to the
   naturalistic view, the spiritual development is exclusively and
   absolutely conditioned on that of the body--is only the bloom and vigor
   of the same. This assertion, as well as the theory on which it is
   based, is refuted by the simple matter of fact that spiritual
   development often far outruns that of the body, and in fact in a normal
   development must do so, and also that in persons of precisely equal
   bodily development, the spiritual ripeness may be very widely
   different. In an as yet unmatured body there may be a mature spirit, in
   a weak and ailing body, a strong spirit; this would be inconceivable on
   the naturalistic hypothesis. But especially the moral development may
   come to ripeness of character much earlier than the corporeal life;
   growth in knowledge is much more dependent on the development of the
   body; the understanding does not outrun the years, and children that
   are early ripe intellectually, are usually morbid phenomena; but a very
   youthful soul may acquire a real and firm moral character. The proverb,
   "Youth is without virtue," in so far as it is meant to be an excuse, is
   absolutely immoral and perverse.

   In consequence of the normal super-ordination of the spirit to the
   body, the spiritual development-stages do not coincide, in point of
   time, with the corresponding bodily stages, but precede them somewhat.
   The first stage is that of childlike innocence, where the child as yet
   knows not how to distinguish between good and evil [Isa. vii, 16],
   where, as yet, the moral consciousness slumbers, and the life-activity
   does not spring from a will conscious of a moral purpose, but, on the
   contrary, from unconscious feelings which are directly excited by
   external or sensuous influences; hence an accountability proper cannot
   as yet be presumed. The child has indeed propensions and aversions,
   love and anger, and other states of feeling, but it does not have them
   intelligently,--is not as yet in spiritual self-possession. Obedience
   is, as yet, a mere scarcely-conscious following, taking its rise simply
   from natural feelings and from the instinct of imitation, and which is
   indeed a germ of morality, though not, as yet, actual morality, but is,
   in-fact, also found to some extent among domesticated animals. The
   typical character of children as presented by Christ [Matt. xviii, 3]
   does not relate to any moral perfection in them, but only to their
   receptiveness for moral impressions, to their innocence, to their
   consciousness of need, and their readiness to believe.

   The stage of transition, or youth, is the time when the person can
   distinguish between good and evil, and where, consequently, there
   exists a real moral consciousness, though not one that is thoroughly
   formed and in every case self-determining, but only primarily a
   consciousness of good and evil in general, and the particular
   application of which in single cases is, for the most part, not left to
   personal free self-determination, but to the guidance of educators. The
   boy has the definite law, as yet, only in an objective manner, in the
   will of his parents; his moral consciousness sketches only general
   outlines,--for the more definite traits and shades it is as yet
   dependent on some other, to him objective, consciousness. Hence the
   most characteristic form of the morality of this period is obedience;
   and the greatest danger to morality, so long as this partial
   uncertainty yet remains, is the tendency, readily resulting from the
   incipient consciousness of moral self-determination, to wish to
   determine one's conduct in particular cases directly and immediately
   from the, as yet, only general and indefinite moral
   consciousness,--that is, the tendency to premature freedom, the
   pleasure in an unregulated enjoyment of freedom, in arbitrary
   self-determination. This in fact was the danger to which our first
   parents fell a prey.

   The stage of moral maturity, in a normal development, far more than
   overtakes that of bodily ripeness. While civil law fixes the civil
   majority, that is, the time of ripe understanding, at the period of
   full bodily maturity, the moral community, the Church, declares man as
   morally mature much earlier (confirmation); also the state fixes full
   moral responsibility much earlier than the civil majority. These
   distinctions rest on well-grounded experience. The young man knows not
   merely moral duty in general, but he is also capable of conforming his
   life thereto in particular. Obedience to parents or guardians assumes
   now the form of obedience to the moral law, which latter indeed
   includes the former, but no longer as an essentially unconditional
   obedience, but simply as one that is to be subordinated to the moral
   law. But a morally mature person can come into an actual conjuncture
   where it is necessary to refuse obedience to parents, only on the
   presupposition of a morally disordered state of humanity; and also
   civil law finds in such obedience, after years of moral majority, no
   excuse for criminal acts.

   The becoming-childish of the aged would be a very weighty reason for
   doubting of personal immortality, were it a normal phenomenon of old
   age. When, however, we consider that even in the present sin-disordered
   condition of the race, this becoming-childish is by no means a
   necessary and universal phenomenon, but that, on the contrary, the
   fruit of a morally-pious life--even in far advanced age, and despite
   the otherwise slumber-like obscuration of the intellectual
   faculties--is a heightening of the religious and moral consciousness,
   and that even the better forms of heathenism consider reverence for the
   moral wisdom of the aged as a high virtue,--we can readily, then, infer
   from this, how little room there would be for a real becoming-childish
   in any respect whatever in an unfallen state of humanity. Precisely
   what would have been the characteristics of normal old age in a sinless
   state, we know not; this much, however, we do know, that the life of an
   immortal spirit, as being destined to a higher ennoblement or
   transfiguration, and as not subject to a positive violent death, could
   not be liable to a return to a state of moral minority,--at the
   farthest it would only have prepared itself for this freely
   self-accomplishing ennobling, by a greater turning away from earthly
   things. All senility of age we can regard only as an absolutely
   abnormal sin-born phenomenon, seeing that it stands in manifest
   antagonism to the nature and destination of the personal spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXVIII.

   2. Differences of temperament--the different tempers of the spirit in
   its bearing toward the outer world, as determined by differences of
   bodily peculiarity. These differences are--as an expression of that
   manifoldness of being which is necessary to the perfection of the
   whole--per se good, and give rise to a vital reciprocalness of relation
   among the members of society. As mere natural determinations of the
   spirit they have primarily no moral significance; they receive such,
   however, as conditions of the moral life. They do not constitute moral
   character; on the contrary, they are, in their disproportionateness, to
   be controlled by the character, and trained into virtue.--Related to
   the temperaments are the normal differences in the natural
   peculiarities of nations.

   From a naturalistic stand-point great importance is attributed to
   temperaments, as if they were original moral determinations. But that
   which is original and merely natural is not as yet moral; it is only
   the antecedent condition of the moral. Moral character is not
   determined by nature, but only by the free action of man himself; in
   proportion as we consider the moral as determined by nature, we destroy
   its very essence. While the ancients considered the temperaments rather
   in their purely corporeal significance, in recent times emphasis is
   often given rather to their spiritually-moral significance, to the
   detriment of morality. On this point there has been much fallacious
   speculation, and the inclination is in many respects manifest, to
   attempt to comprehend man in his moral peculiarity from mere
   nature-circumstances, rather than honestly to look into his moral
   nature--to search his heart; and men are very ready to excuse their
   moral foibles and vices on the score of temperament; this course is
   naturalistic, and, in fact, materialistic. Temperament is, essentially,
   simply the normal basis on which morality is to develop itself; it does
   not, however, itself determine the moral life-task, but only has
   influence in throwing it into its peculiar form; he whose character is
   shaped only by his temperament has no character. The moral character
   stands above all temperament; and where there are different and opposed
   temperaments like moral characters may be formed, and the converse.
   Temperaments are not per se a peculiarity of the spirit, but are based
   in that of the corporeal life, and pass over upon the spirit only by
   virtue of a kind of communicatio idiomatum. It is usual to distinguish
   four temperaments,--according to the susceptibility for external
   influences, and to the active bearing toward the outer world: (1) that
   which is very open for outward impressions, and is at the same time
   more acted upon from without than self-active--the light, sanguine
   temperament;--(2) that which is very open for outward impressions, but
   is at the same time rather self-active, initiatively working, and
   influencing the outer world--the warm, choleric temperament;--(3) that
   which is less receptive for outward impressions, and at the same time
   rather inactive, indifferent--the cool, phlegmatic temperament;--(4)
   that which, while equally feebly-receptive for outward impressions, is
   yet more active, storing up in itself what it receives--the heavy
   melancholic temperament.--The types of temperament, however, do not
   usually appear under these pure forms; generally they are commingled
   and toned down. Nor does a temperament always remain the same, but it
   changes with the outward relations and age of the person.

   As the moral person is not to permit himself to be determined by the
   irrational, but should himself freely determine himself on the basis of
   the moral consciousness, hence he is all the more moral the more he
   subordinates his temperament to his moral will,--not cultivating simply
   those virtues which are more congenial to his temperament, as, for
   example, friendliness in the sanguine, patience in the phlegmatic,
   courage in the choleric, etc. Morality consists rather, on the
   contrary, in the inner harmony of all the different moral phases, and
   must consequently counteract the one-sidedness of any particular
   temperament. The light temperament tends to frivolity, the warm to
   passionateness and revenge, the cool to indifference and indolence, the
   heavy to selfishness and narrowness. He who leaves his temperament
   unbridled, cultivates not its virtue but its defect; for virtue is
   never a mere nature-proclivity. As a peculiar endowment, temperament,
   like every other endowment, must be morally shaped, and hence brought
   into proper harmony with the moral whole of the life. No sin finds a
   moral justification in temperament; and, on the other hand, only that
   course of action is morally good which springs not merely from
   temperament, but from the moral consciousness.

   The differences of natural national peculiarities are related to the
   difference of temperament. Also in a sinless state, a diversity among
   nations, a difference of taste, etc., arising primarily from
   differences of country, would be perfectly normal and necessary [Acts
   xvii, 26]. As the mountaineer is different in his entire bodily and
   spiritual temper from the dweller in the plain, the inhabitant of the
   North from him of the Tropics, etc., so there arises therefrom a
   diversity of forms of the moral life-work,--which, however, cannot come
   into hostile antagonism with each other, but in fact constitute a
   stimulating diversity, from which arises an all the greater and more
   vital harmony of the whole. Labor and enjoyment, the family-life and
   the life of society, will necessarily assume different forms; and the
   proper development and preservation of the normal peculiarities of
   nations form an essential feature of general moral perfection. It is
   not as a progress of spiritual and moral culture, but to some extent as
   a perversion thereof, that we must regard the tendency manifested in
   recent times to sweep away, to a large extent, the peculiarities of
   nations, and to bring about the greatest possible uniformity.
   Manifoldness of language and spirit is not confusion, and it has, as
   opposed to a bald, lifeless monotony, its legitimate moral right. The
   sons of Jacob, as differing in character, imparted also a normal
   difference to the tribes in Israel; nevertheless one spirit could and
   should have pervaded them all.

   3. The difference of sex conditions a correspondingly different
   peculiarity of the moral life-work. Man represents the outward-working,
   productive phase of humanity, woman the receptive and formative,--he
   more the spirit-phase, she more the nature-phase; in him preponderate
   thought and will; in her rather the feelings, the heart; to man it is
   more peculiar to act initiatively,--to woman rather, morally to
   associate herself. The moral life-work of each is different in the
   details, but in both it is of like dignity; it is simply two different
   mutually-complementing phases of the same morality. The morality of
   both sexes consists, in fact, in especially developing that phase of
   the moral life that is peculiar to each,--not as strictly the same as,
   but as in harmony with, the peculiarity of the other.

   The antithesis of the two sexes is the highest spiritualized
   manifestation of that primitive antithesis of the operative and the
   reposing, the active and the passive, that conditions all earthly
   life,--that assumes an endless variety of forms, and appears in each
   single phenomenon of the world under some of its many forms of
   combination. Nowhere do we find mere force, nowhere mere matter, but
   every-where in nature both are united, and yet they are not the same.
   What this primitive antithesis is in nature,--what the greater
   antitheses of the light and the heavy, repulsion and attraction, motion
   and rest, sun and planet, animal and plant, arteries and veins, etc.,
   are,--this is, in highest refinement and perfection, the antithesis of
   man and woman in humanity. That the nature-phase is somewhat more
   prominent in woman than in man is evidenced also by the earlier
   physical development and maturity of the female sex, and by the greater
   dependence on nature and on the changes of the seasons in the entire
   female sex-life. The higher intellectual power is undoubtedly with man,
   and the moral subordination of woman to man in wedlock and in society
   is an unmistakable law of universal order. The difference of the two
   sexes is not to be t6ned down, but to be developed into moral harmony.
   As an effeminate man or masculine woman is offensive to the esthetic
   sense, and a hermaphrodite repugnant to uncorrupted feelings, and a
   sexless form expressionless and unnatural, so also, in moral respects,
   it is the duty of man to cultivate his manliness, and of woman to
   cultivate her womanliness; and any assumption by one party of the
   peculiarities of the opposite sex, is not only unnatural but also
   immoral.

II. THE COMMUNITY-LIFE AS A MORAL SUBJECT.

    SECTION LXX.

   Man is not simply an individual being, but, by virtue of his moral
   rationality, which seeks everywhere to reduce the manifold to unity, he
   effects also a moral community-life, a community of persons, to which
   the individual is related as a serving member, and which has in turn
   itself a definite moral life-purpose, to the fulfilling of which the
   individual members are indeed called, though this moral life-purpose,
   that is to be carried out by the individual, is not identical with the
   life-work which he, as a personal individual, has to fulfill for
   himself. A plurality of persons constitutes a moral community-life only
   when, in virtue of a real common-consciousness, and a common moral
   life-purpose, they are molded into a life-unity, so that the individual
   members bring not only the whole into active relation to themselves,
   but also and essentially themselves into active relation to the whole;
   and the moral life of the individual is the more perfect the more it
   develops itself into a life of the whole; and the ultimate goal of
   moral development is, that all humanity become a unitary moral
   community. The true morality of the individual assumes therefore always
   a twofold form: one that is personally-individual, and one that is an
   expression of the moral life-purpose of the community-life, and in the
   name of which it fulfills that purpose; neither is subordinate to the
   other, but they stand in vital reciprocity of relation.

   The notion of the community-life as a moral subject is of very great
   significance for ethics. Heathenism attained to it but very
   imperfectly, inasmuch as the thought of the unity of mankind was
   entirely wanting, and as where the community-life was most
   prominent--in China--there only a naturalistic, mechanical world-theory
   prevailed, and as, on the contrary, where the personal spirit came into
   prominence--in the Occident--there it did so only in the form of the
   strong individual will,--that is, the will did not appear as general
   but as individual and arbitrary, so that the community-life itself bore
   the impress of the individual will. In the Israelitic theocracy we
   find, in virtue of the divine disciplinary purpose, only the embryonic
   beginnings of the community-life; as yet, the morality of the
   individual prevails over the collective morality. But to the idea of
   the latter itself there is very clear allusion. The words, "I will make
   of thee a great nation;... in thee shall all families of the earth be
   blessed" [Gen. xii, 2, 3], are not a mere blessing, but they imply also
   for Abraham a moral duty, namely, that he live not for himself, but
   also for his people, and through them for the whole race,--that he work
   and act not merely as Abram but as Abraham, as the father of nations
   [Gen. xvii, 5]. Christianity brought the great idea to realization; the
   truth that makes man truly free rendered again possible the founding of
   a true moral community,--primarily as the Church, but then also as the
   Christian state. The idea of moral communion becomes here at once a
   fundamental one. Personal communion with the personal Son of God and of
   Man as chief, creates the true, vital moral community-life; the
   individual lives for the community and the community for the
   individual, and both through Christ and for Christ. This circumstance
   is very suggestive as to the moral destination of humanity as sinless.

   The moral activity of the individual person as such is clearly to be
   distinguished from the moral activity of the same as an embodiment of
   the public morality. The mere circumstance, that in a state of
   sinfulness these two forms of morality may appear in antithesis and
   contradiction--that a man may perform his duty as a citizen to a
   certain degree of serviceableness, while his personal morality stands
   very low--shows that in the thing itself there is a real difference.
   What I do as a vital member of the moral community--as it were out of
   the spirit of the same, and to some extent, in the name of and as
   representing the same, that is, what I do, not because I am a moral
   individual, but because I belong, as a part, to a moral
   community,--that must of course, under circumstances of moral maturity,
   be in entire harmony with my personal moral disposition; but harmony is
   not identity. As representing the moral community-life and the common
   consciousness, my personal individual will retires essentially into the
   back-ground, and the public spirit possesses me and guides me,--rules
   sovereignly in me, and thrusts aside even my otherwise legitimate
   individual weal. The warrior, in fighting for his country, acts not
   from his personal individual will; he seeks, in case he enters into it
   morally, nothing for himself, but every thing solely for his country;
   he sacrifices his personal right to domestic happiness, to quiet labor,
   to legitimate enjoyments, and even his life itself, for the
   community,--not as a personal individual, but as a vital member of the
   nation. The morality of the individual bears more a masculine, that of
   the community more a feminine character, inasmuch as in the latter case
   there is a predominancy of yielding to influence, of self-associating,
   of devotion even to sacrifice. The moral honor of a community is other
   than that of the individual; when the soldier defends the flag of his
   regiment, it is not, or should not be, his own honor, but that of the
   entire body, that prompts him; and where there is honor, there is also
   morality.

   The distinction of this twofold morality presents itself, under one of
   the special forms of the second phase, namely, official morality, as
   recognizable also outwardly. What the clergyman, the soldier, the judge
   does officially, is also morality, but it is not by any means identical
   with his personal morality, as is shown even by the fact of the
   different degrees of censure incurred for violations of duty in the two
   spheres. An untruth, a deception, perpetrated in official activity, is
   much more severely punished, and deserves also severer moral rebuke,
   than a like act done in non-official life. He who is acting in a public
   capacity is not at liberty to overlook an offered indignity, while his
   very first duty when insulted in a private capacity, is, to manifest a
   readiness for reconciliation. The moral community often expresses this
   difference in the fact that those who act principally and
   professionally in its name, wear a special official garb, so that the
   entire external appearance and bearing of such public persons are not
   governed merely by their personally free self-determination. but bear
   the impress of that which transcends the individual will, namely, the
   community-life; personal character, while realizing public morality,
   falls back behind the character of the community-life. Nevertheless it
   is true that the whole moral activity and life of the individual
   contributes essentially to the honor or shame of the family and of the
   community to which he belongs [Lev. xxi, 9], so that consequently this
   distinction of a twofold moral sphere of activity does not amount to a
   real separation.

GOD AS THE GROUND AND PROTOTYPE OF THE MORAL LIFE AND AS THE AUTHOR OF THE LAW.

     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXXI.

   As morality is connected with religion in an indissolubly vital unity,
   hence the God-consciousness is the necessary presupposition and
   condition of morality, and the character and degree of the morality is
   consequently also conditioned on the character and degree of the
   God-consciousness, although a higher degree of the latter does not
   necessarily work also a higher degree of morality. Hence true morality
   is only there possible where there is a true God-consciousness, that
   is, where God is not conceived of as in some manner limited, but as the
   infinite Spirit in the fullest sense of the word. Only where the moral
   idea has its absolutely perfect reality, in the personal holy God, has
   morality a firm basis, true contents, and an unconditional goal.

   If morality is in any manner conditioned by religion, then is also the
   quality of this morality different in different religions. We have
   already shown that morality is not conditioned by the mere
   God-consciousness, but only by it as having grown into religion, for a
   God-consciousness which does not become a religious one, but remains
   mere knowledge, cannot become a moral power; and this is the simple
   explanation of the fact, that while a feebler God-consciousness cannot
   produce a higher degree of morality, yet a higher God-consciousness
   does not necessarily create also a higher degree of morality,--namely,
   when it does not develop itself into a religious life-power. When it
   does so develop itself, however, then it is unconditionally true that
   the degree of morality perfectly corresponds to the degree of
   God-consciousness;--otherwise we would be forced to modify our
   previously assumed position, that religion and morality are two
   indissolubly united and mutually absolutely conditioning phases of one
   and the same spiritual life. Where God is conceived of as merely an
   unspiritual nature-force, as in China and India, there morality cannot
   rest on the free moral personality of man, but, on the contrary, it
   must throw the personality into the back-ground as illegitimate; where
   the divine is conceived of only in the form of an antagonism of
   mutually hostile divinities, as with the Persians, there the moral idea
   lacks its unconditional obligatoriness, and in fact the contra-moral
   has its relative justification; and where the divine is conceived of as
   a plurality of limited individual personalities, there the sphere of
   morality is invaded by the pretensions of the arbitrarily
   self-determining subject, and moral action lacks a solid basis. It is
   only where there is a consciousness of the infinite personal Spirit
   that both the moral personality is free, and the moral idea absolutely
   unconditional and sure. The heathen do not really have the divine law;
   they have only, lying in the very nature of the rational spirit, an
   unconscious presentiment of the same [Rom. ii, 14, 15].--Though
   Polytheism is with us no longer in fashion, still we are all the more
   infested with Pantheism, or such a form of Deism as differs therefrom
   only by an unscientific arbitrary inconsequence,--not, however, by any
   means with that vigorous and comparatively respectable Pantheism of
   India which drew, with moral earnestness, the full practical
   consequence of its world-theory, and presented in an
   actually-carried-out renunciation of the world the very contrary of our
   natural and legitimate claim to happiness,--but, on the contrary, with
   a Pantheism that is in every respect morbid and characterless, and
   which, greedy of enjoyment, delights itself in a world robbed of God.
   Pantheism lacks the antecedent condition of all morality, namely,
   personal freedom; with the universal prevalence of unconditional
   necessity there is no place for choice and self-determination; it also
   lacks a moral purpose, seeing that it knows no ideal,
   reality-transcending goal of morality, but, on the contrary, must
   acknowledge the real as per se the fulfillment of the ideal, that is,
   as good,--and for the reason that that which appears as a goal of
   life-development, is, in fact, realized from necessity; it lacks also a
   moral motive, for the sole causative ground of the absolutely necessary
   life-development is, as unfree and as unfreely-acting, non-moral,--is
   only a conscious nature-impulse. On the assumption that the entire
   being and activity of the individual is simply a necessary expression
   of the existence and life which God generates for himself in the world,
   it follows that each and every being is fully and perfectly justified
   in whatever nature and activity he may chance to appear, and no one can
   reproach another because of any seeming moral depravity. The moral
   tendencies of Pantheism, and of the therewith essentially identical
   Naturalism, must not be judged of from individual instances of men who
   are still unconsciously imbued with the moral spirit of the community,
   but rather from the effects that result where this world-theory has
   taken hold on the masses,--as at the time of the Reign of Terror in
   France, and in the bearing and aspirations of our more recent
   demagogues of reform, nearly all of whom are imbued with Pantheistic
   views.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXXII.

   The personal God is the basis of the moral, (1) in that He, as holy
   will, is the eternal fountain and embodiment of the moral idea. The
   good is not a mere object of a possible willing, not merely ought to be
   willed, but is eternally willed by an eternal will, and is nothing
   other than the contents of this will itself; God is the absolutely
   moral spirit, the holy spirit--perfectly at one with himself in his
   free personality, and eternally self-consistent,--and who as such
   guarantees to the moral life-task of his free creatures, full truth,
   unconditional and permanent validity as God's requirement, and unshaken
   certainty, and perfect, constant unity and consistency.

   Outside of the Christian God-consciousness the moral idea lacks all
   certainty and strength. It is easy to say, that we should do the good
   for its own sake, that the moral law presents itself as a "categorical
   imperative," but in the reality of life such generalities will not
   avail. For a mere idea without any sort of reality, no human heart can
   grow actively warm; here there is at best only an intellectual
   interest, but not a morally-practical one. The validity of the moral
   idea must have a deeper basis than a mere intellectual process. Before
   I can do the good for its own sake, I must love it; before I love it, I
   must with full certainty know it. So long as I am in doubt as to what
   is good, or as to whether there is any good, I have no object of love.
   The essence of the good, however, implies that the same is not my
   merely subjective opinion, but that it is universally valid--good per
   se. Now, should I leave the God-consciousness out of sight, then there
   would remain for me, in order to determine the unconditional validity
   of a supposed moral precept, and to avoid the possibility of a mere
   arbitrary judgment, no other resort than the impracticable test of
   Kant. [8] ." Suppose, however, that, apart from religious faith, there
   were in fact a scientific source for a certain knowledge of the moral
   law, still this would not yet answer the purpose;--not every one can be
   a philosopher, but all are required to be moral. Hence the moral
   consciousness cannot be based on mere scientific demonstrations, but
   must have a basis available for all rational men; now just such a
   resource is the God-consciousness. So soon as I know that a mode of
   action is God's will, then am I perfectly certain that it is good, that
   it has universal and unconditional validity;--I have not to infer that
   because it is universally valid, therefore it is God's will, but the
   converse. Without certainty of moral consciousness there can be no
   moral confidence; in this connection all doubt works ruin. The question
   is as to certainty of moral consciousness, and hence essentially as to
   God's will's becoming known to me.

   So soon as there exists a consciousness of God, all good must be
   referred absolutely to God's will; whatever God wills is good, and
   whatever is good is God's will. The divine order of the world assumes,
   in the sphere of the free will of creatures, the form of a moral
   command; the "must" becomes a "should;" this is not a lowering, but an
   exalting of the law, for freely realized good is higher than the
   unfreely realized, seeing that God himself is freedom. If a moral duty
   is God's will, then I am also further certain that it cannot be in real
   conflict with other moral duties. This is the high moral significancy
   of faith in the living God, namely, that it alone can give a full unity
   and certainty to the moral consciousness; with every limitation of the
   idea of God the moral consciousness also becomes uncertain and
   doubtful. Hence the Scriptures, even in the Old Testament, attribute
   such high significancy to the unity and unchangeableness of the holy
   and almighty God as moral law-giver, and base thereon, in contrast to
   heathenism, all morality,--as, for example, in Gen. xvii, 1; Deut. vi,
   4 sqq.; x, 14, 17. In the first passage God's omnipotence is emphasized
   in order to awaken in man a consciousness of his dependence; inasmuch
   as all existence is absolutely in God's hand, therefore should also
   man's free activity subordinate itself to Him,--therefore also is the
   sinful effort to be independent of God, that is, to be equal to God,
   unmitigated folly. Hence also he, who walks before the Almighty, has
   the assurance that he will attain to his goal; thou canst, for the
   reason that thou shouldst, for it is God who places upon thee the
   "should."

   But the certainty of the moral idea is only one of its phases, the
   other is its actuating power. It is true, the idea itself of the good
   should move the will; but its power is immeasurably greater When it is
   itself the expression of a holy will than when it merely speaks to the
   human will. It is the sacred awe of the Holy One that lends it this
   power. In a mere idea I can have pleasure, but it cannot inspire me
   with awe. The command that emanates from the Living One, gives life; a
   mere idea pre-supposes life as a condition of its efficacy. The moral
   idea becomes truly influential on the personal spirit only by its being
   the actual will of a personal God. "The statutes of the Lord are right,
   rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening
   the eyes" [Psa. xix, 8].

   The question: is a thing good because God wills it, or does God will it
   because it is good? contains for us no contradiction. It would do so,
   however, if the first clause meant, that it is accidental and arbitrary
   that God declares this or that to be good, and that He might also just
   as well have declared good the very opposite (Duns Scotus, Occam,
   Descartes, Pufendorf). God cannot will anything else than what is
   God-like--corresponding to his nature; this "cannot" is a limitation
   only in the form of expression, in reality it is the highest
   perfection. A being that can come into contradiction and antagonism
   with itself, is not perfect. If the good is that which corresponds to
   the divine nature, and if God's will is necessarily an expression of
   his nature, then, whatever is good is good because God wills it, and
   God wills it because it is good. God's declaration: "I am that I am"
   [Exod. iii, 14] is valid also for his holy volitions. The idea of the
   good is not something existing without and apart from God, it is a
   direct beam from his inner nature.

    SECTION LXXIII.

   God is the basis of the moral, (2), in that He reveals himself in his
   universe as the Holy One,--discovers himself to man as the prototype of
   the moral, as the personally holy pattern after which man should form
   himself. In this consciousness of God as prototype of the moral, man
   conceives morality as Godlikeness, and himself,; in his true moral
   dignity, as God's image and as a child of God.

   The idea of a moral self-revelation of God is of wide-reaching moral
   significancy. Heathenism knows nothing of such a self-revelation; it is
   true, in the higher heathen religions, moral laws are referred to a
   divine origin, but this signifies simply either a revelation of the
   general laws of world-order, or, at best, a revelation of the divine
   will in regard to men, but not of the real moral nature of God.
   According to the Christian world-view, the good is not merely to be
   realized, but it exists already in full reality from eternity; morality
   is not to create something absolutely new, but only to shape the
   created after the model of its divine Creator; the free creature is to
   become like the holy God,--to come into free harmony, not simply with a
   naked idea but with an eternal reality. As a consequence of this,
   morality has an incomparably higher certainty and vitality than if the
   moral law appeared merely under the form of an idea. There can be no
   more convincing logic than the word: "Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord
   your God am holy" [Lev. xix, 2; xi, 44, 45; xx, 7; comp. Deut. x, 17
   sqq.; 1 Pet. i, 15, 16; Eph. v, 1]; and Christ himself repeatedly
   presents the moral essence of God as the true pattern for man, both in
   general and in particular [Matt. v, 48; Luke vi, 36]. Even as in
   education there is no better moral instruction than that by personal
   example, so is there also in the moral education of humanity no more
   deeply influential moral revelation than that of the holy personality
   of God; and as the child naturally seeks not so much to realize a
   lifeless law as to become like a beloved and revered personal example,
   so is it likewise the case in the moral development of humanity in
   general; and this is not childlike immaturity, but rational truth; and
   herein also is the child a proper example. In realizing morality man
   does not present himself in the All as a solitarily-shining star, but
   as a God-loved and God-loving image of the invisible God,--as a human
   resplendence of His holiness.

   A much deeper impression than that made by the revelation of the holy
   personality of God through speech, is made by the revelation of the
   same by actual reality in the person of Christ. We cannot answer here
   the oft proposed question as to whether the Son of God would have
   become man even had not sin entered into the world; the Scriptures give
   us on this point no decision; and even those who affirm it do not place
   the advent of the perfect man at the beginning of the race. Hence, even
   in this view, the coming of Christ is not held as a necessary condition
   of the moral life. But as Christ is in fact not merely the Redeemer
   suffering for and through sin, but also the true personal manifestation
   of the perfect image of God--the absolutely perfect prototype of human
   morality,--hence, for us, who are no longer in the condition of
   original sinlessness, the knowledge of pure morality is essentially
   conditioned on a knowledge of Christ. The first sin-free human beings
   needed not this historically-personal example in order to have a
   truthful moral consciousness, and to be able to realize morality; but
   we need it--we who have had to be redeemed from the curse and power of
   sin; we need, also as a help to a knowledge of the morality of unfallen
   man, this example that did not rise out of sin but stood above it. In a
   much higher degree, in fact, than Christ is the example for the
   redeemed, Is he the true criterion for a knowledge of unfallen human
   nature; for there is much in the moral life of the Christian for which
   Christ's own life cannot be a direct example; for instance, the
   continuous struggle against the still-remaining sin in the human
   heart,--in Christ there was no such struggle; to him every thing that
   was sinful was foreign and external, but never inward and personal. On
   the. contrary, there could be nothing in the moral life, of unfallen
   man which could not be directly connected with the person of Christ,
   though indeed, not all the special phases of human morality could have
   their particular expression in the life of Christ. Thus we have
   occasion here to make at least allusion to Christ.

    SECTION LXXIV.

   God is the basis of the moral, (3), in that, omnipresently ruling and
   judging in his universe, He wisely, lovingly, and justly guides and
   furthers toward its eternal goal the moral life of his creatures,
   without, however; interfering with their moral freedom. This
   consciousness gives to the moral life full confidence and joy in the
   fulfillment of the divine will, and the proper fear of all that is
   ungodly.

   The thought of a merely impersonal moral world-order may seem in itself
   simple and attractive; for real life, however, it is of no efficiency.
   Even the proud equanimity of the Stoic is unable definitively to find
   any better remedy for the antagonism of the reality of existence with
   his self-conceived ideals, than suicide; and those who, in recent
   times, assuming that the Christian World-view is gloomy and
   unhumanitarian, prefer to it the domination of eternal impersonal
   necessity, and explain away all evil and anarchy as mere appearance,
   gain after all from this pretended self-explaining and all-reconciling
   view, little other profit than a complacent satisfaction with
   themselves and with their own system.. So long as man cannot rid
   himself of his consciousness of freedom and of the possibility of its
   misuse, as well as of his consciousness of the reality of evil in the
   world, just so long will the notion of a world-order unembodied in a
   personal God prove to be powerless. The Greek had a much higher
   world-theory than that of ordinary Pantheism, and yet he could not
   explain away the antagonism that exists between the moral life and
   non-moral fate, or the excess of real evil; and he gave utterance, in
   his noblest intellectual productions, either to a melancholy lament
   over the mysterious tragedy of life, or to a blank hopelessness as to
   the triumph of the good. Greek tragedy is, by far, more moral than the
   anti-Christian Pantheism of recent date. To feel and bewail the
   antagonism of existence even with out-spoken hopelessness, approximates
   more nearly the truth than to explain it away with delusive sophistry.
   In a world where the misuse of moral freedom may create evil and
   disturb the harmony of existence, there can be hopefulness and
   confidence in moral effort only in virtue of a firm faith in the
   personally-ruling almighty and holy God; without this there is for the
   rational spirit no possibility of an unshaken conviction that a truly
   moral conduct will, in fact, bring real fruit, and not prove to be a
   useless vain undertaking, an empty play of a restless
   activity-instinct.--We are here as yet not dealing with a world
   actually disordered by sin; but also for the unfallen state all moral
   effort becomes impossible, becomes even idle folly, so soon as we
   assume even the possibility of a disturbance of the harmony of the
   world,--unless there exists at the same time the consciousness of a
   holy God freely ruling above all creature-life, and conducting the
   moral order of the universe. But the possibility of such a disturbance
   through the misuse of freedom, is directly implied in the idea of
   freedom. Hence the notion of a merely general world-order without a
   personally-ruling God does not suffice, even for the unfallen state, to
   give to moral effort the necessary confidence. The question is here as
   to a certainty not merely that the moral efforts of the individual will
   bear the expected fruit for himself,--though we must consider this also
   as a perfectly legitimate claim,--but also, in general, that his moral
   efforts will not be in vain for the furtherance of the perfection of
   the whole,--will not be counteracted by the possibly interfering power
   of evil. Without the confidence that by virtue of the all-potent wisdom
   of the personal God, all truly moral effort will bear legitimate fruit,
   and that evil can never prevent him who continues faithful, from
   reaching the last and highest goal of the moral, and that consequently
   the anarchy that evil Brings into the world will fall only on the heads
   of the evil-doers, while even the "prince of this world" can effect
   nothing against the just [John xiv, 30],--without this confidence, the
   courage and vitality of all morality are paralyzed. Also in the
   unfallen state human knowledge must still be limited,--must be unable
   to see into the ultimate depths and ends of existence, and least of all
   into the future. Hence, without confidence there is no means of rising
   above doubt as to the success of moral effort, and consequently also of
   a degree of discouragement in the same. The true moral courage is not a
   blind defiance of fate, but a rejoicing in the consciousness that all
   things work to the good of those who love God [Rom. vii, 28], and that
   "in Him we live and move and have our being" [Acts xvii, 28],--that
   God, the ground and source of all morality, is not far from any one of
   us, but works in and with us for the accomplishment of his holy
   will.--And as effort for the good can be potent only through confidence
   in God, so also is the moral dread of evil effectual only through the
   fear of God. Not as if a mere fear of punishment were to restrain man
   from evil, but rather a holy awe of the holy and all-knowing God. This
   is also fear,--not, however, slavish, selfish fear, but moral
   reverence, befitting shame in the presence of the pure and holy One. To
   say that man should shun evil even irrespectively of God, is empty
   talk; if he believes in God, then he cannot leave Him out of thought at
   the sight of evil; and if he believes not in God, then he believes also
   not in the holiness of the moral command, and he will in fact not shun
   the evil,--he will simply deny it, as modern observation proves. The
   fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and also of morality [Psa.
   cxi, 10]; "fear the Lord and keep his commandments," says the Preacher
   [Eccles. xii, 13]; this is the fundamental idea of morality in the Old
   Testament [comp. Deut. x, 12, 13]. There is one Lawgiver and Judge who
   is able to save and destroy [James iv, 12]; in the unity of the
   lawgiver and judge lies the guarantee and holy potency of morality.
   Whoever believes, not merely in an All, but in the living God, and
   knows that all that is hidden from human eyes is known to the
   all-knowing One, and that all secret sins rest under the curse of Him
   who can kill and make alive, who can wound and heal, and out of whose
   hand there is none that can deliver [Deut. xxvii, 15 sqq.; xxxii,
   39],--such a one will evidently have a very different dread of evil
   from that of him who regards it as a mere world-inherent necessary
   transition-stage to perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXXV.

   God is the basis of the moral, (4), in that as holy Lawgiver he reveals
   his eternal, holy will in time. The totality of created being is, in
   the design of the creative will, to be in harmony with God and with
   itself. The idea of this harmony, as active in God under the form of
   will, is God's law. Unfree creatures have it as an inner necessity, and
   must fulfill it; free creatures have it as a moral command, and should
   fulfill it; for the former it exists as an unconscious instinct or
   impulse, for the latter it is revealed; as God's law, it is made known
   to rational creatures by revelation. The moral law is therefore the
   revealed will of God as to the rational creature,--namely, that the
   same should bring its entire life, consciously and with free will, into
   harmony with God's purpose.

   A law which cannot be derived from God's will is not a moral law, but
   at best a civil one. That the moral law is based in the inner essence
   of the human reason is not controverted by the proposition, that it is
   God's will, but it is in fact confirmed. Human reason is conditioned by
   the same divine will which wills the good; and as, among the goods
   which God himself created, the highest is reason, hence the inner
   essence of the reason must involve also the moral,--not, however, as
   something conditioned independently of God, but in fact as God's will
   revealed to the reason, in so far as the latter has kept itself
   unclouded. However, this moral law, as immanent in the reason, is not
   to be conceived as implying that the rational will gives law unto
   itself; it is the part of the will to submit itself to the law, but not
   to give it; the moral law is above the will, above human reason in
   general; and the latter, in its consciousness of the same, recognizes
   it in fact as divine, and consequently as absolutely valid and beyond
   the scope of human determination. As little as man can give to himself
   reason and its dialectical laws, so little can he give to himself moral
   law. Freedom of will has to do only with the fulfilling, but not with
   the conditioning of the law. The morally cognizing reason simply finds
   revealed within itself the divine law, but does not make it. The
   Scriptures uniformly present the moral law as being essentially the
   will of God, without, however, thereby interfering with the idea that
   the same is the expression of the inner purpose of being itself. "Be ye
   transformed," says Paul, [Rom. xii, 2], "by the renewing of your mind,
   that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of
   God;" the "will" of God is here the fundamental; any thing is "good"
   only because it expresses the will of God which is itself good per se;
   the "acceptable" is that which is good relatively to the spirit that is
   contemplating it,--that excites approbation in the rational spirit, and
   is in harmony therewith,--in a word, that is in harmony with God and
   his thoughts, and with God-related spirit in general; and the
   "perfect," the goal-attaining, is whatever is the realization of the
   divine and good end. Thus the apostle expresses the essence of the good
   under all its phases; the good is good both as to its origin, as to the
   cognizing spirit, and as to its end.

    SECTION LXXVI.

   In treating of the moral law as the expression of the divine will, we
   have two points to consider, first, the communication of this law by
   God to man, and then its inner essence.

I. THE REVELATION OF THE DIVINE WILL TO MAN.

   This revelation reveals to us not only the contents of the divine law,
   but must also reveal it as the divine will. This manifestation of the
   holy will of God is of a twofold character. In reason, which is the
   more especial embodiment of the divine image, and which is consequently
   the God-ward phase of man, man has the power of recognizing the divine
   will in regard to reason,--the rational life-purpose of the rational
   spirit. Hence, by virtue of his rationality, man has the divine law in
   himself as a personal knowledge attained to through free
   self-development. The divine will-revelation is therefore primarily an
   inner revelation within the rational spirit conditioned by the creative
   will itself. As, however, this knowledge cannot be a directly-given
   one, but must be first attained to by morally-spiritual activity, hence
   it cannot be for morality the sufficient antecedent condition. There is
   a necessity therefore, in order to the commencement of the
   morally-rational life of humanity, of a special training of the same by
   God unto moral knowledge,--of a direct extraordinary objective
   revelation by means of which man may have from the very beginning a
   definite consciousness as to the divine will, and a firm guarantee of
   the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   (a) The extraordinary, positive and supernatural revelation of the
   divine will, in the educative guidance of man by God, precedes indeed
   his own reason-knowledge as arising from the inner, general, natural
   revelation, but in a normal development of man it then gradually
   retires into the back-ground in proportion as his spiritual ripening
   advances. Its purpose is to awaken rational knowledge, and to conduct
   the awakened spirit to its spiritual majority; and hence it involves
   the virtualizing of the moral freedom and of the independent
   personality of the rational spirit.

   The seeming contradiction that lies in the facts, that rational
   knowledge cannot be given in an immediate and ready form, but must be
   first attained to through moral effort, and that, on the other hand,
   all moral activity presupposes already the consciousness of the moral,
   is reconciled solely and simply by the fact that the creating God is
   also an educating one,--that He reveals to man Himself and his
   will,--even as also the child does not ripen to reason and maturity by
   being abandoned to itself, but by being educated by reason and to
   reason,--by having the moral consciousness which as yet slumbers in it
   awakened by instruction, and, when once awakened, then strengthened by
   actual moral example. Without instruction and training the child never
   becomes a truly rational person; and when, in harmony with the
   Christian system, we affirm the same thing of the first man, we do not
   thereby state anything inconsistent with the nature of man, but in fact
   simply that which is implied in the very nature of rational
   spirit-development. If for a moment we should, with Rousseau, conceive
   of the first generations of man as in a condition of animal unculture,
   creeping on all fours, and without speech, then we are utterly unable
   to learn from any of the champions of this theory in what manner these
   human-like animals could ever attain to reason and to a moral
   consciousness. We have in fact, in the case of the uncivilized tribes
   of the race--who, low as they are, are yet not so low as the
   above-supposed semi-men,--positive proof that man when once sunk into
   the condition of a savage never again rises to a higher culture, of his
   own strength.

   Without a consciousness of God and of his will, man is as yet, on the
   whole, not rational; but man was created by God after his own image,
   and hence unto reason and unto morality. This implies of itself that
   this consciousness was necessarily shared in even by the first man. Now
   as man knows nothing of nature save as nature communicates herself to
   him through sensuous impressions, so also can man know nothing of God
   unless God reveals himself to him; and in fact a God who should not
   reveal himself is utterly unconceivable. If now a consciousness of the
   moral, that is of God's will, is the necessary antecedent condition of
   all moral activity, and if, at the same time, all real rational
   knowledge springs from a moral using of such knowledge, then is it
   perfectly self-evident that the beginning of this knowledge must have
   been directly prompted by God himself. The fact that this first
   revelation is termed, in distinction from the self-wrought-out
   knowledge, an extraordinary and supernatural one, does not imply that
   it stands in contradiction or antagonism to the inner revelation in the
   self-developing spirit. On the contrary it is for the development of
   humanity in general both very natural and in harmony with general
   order; for, all life of individual objects, both in the spiritual and
   in the natural world, requires a first stimulation, an awakening
   influence from other already developed objects and beings; and this
   stimulating rises toward educative training in proportion as the
   perfection of the species rises; man has therefore, by virtue of his
   rational nature, a claim upon an educative influence from the rational
   spirit; and this is in fact the historical revelation. Man is not by
   his birth or creation already really a morally-rational spirit, he
   becomes so only by an educative influence from the rational spirit, and
   hence, in the case of the first man, from a primarily objective
   revelation from God. This revelation, however, does not remain in this
   objective character, but, in stimulating man to a moral consciousness
   and to moral activity, it brings him to the inner revelation in the
   rational nature of man himself--to a consciousness of his own
   God-likeness, and hence also to a consciousness of the divine
   prototype. The first man sustained to God an absolutely child-like
   relation, as to an educating father; and such is precisely the Biblical
   account of the primitive state. If we do not presuppose such an
   educative primitive revelation of the moral, then, either the moral law
   would have to exist, (as in irrational nature-creatures, so also in
   man) as a direct instinctive impulse,--in which case man would not be a
   moral being, but only a peculiar species of animal; or, a rational
   knowledge of the moral would have to be already created in him,--which
   would be contrary to all our notions of man's spiritual development,
   and surely a much greater miracle than the one which it was designed to
   dispense with. That which has no need of training is either not a
   rational being, or it is God himself. The educative revelation
   presupposes indeed a corresponding moral endowment in man; but this
   moral endowment, the unconscious germ of the moral, has need, in order
   to its developing itself into reality, of a spiritual training. This
   training does not create the moral consciousness, but only awakens
   it--gives to it primarily definite contents, which the thus stimulated
   morally rational consciousness then perceives as not in antagonism but
   as in harmony with itself, and for that very reason appropriates to
   itself.

   In order to man's being really moral he must be conscious that in his
   free acting he freely subordinates himself to the will of God; but he
   can do this only when he recognizes the moral, not merely as such, but
   also as being of divine origin, and this he can do only when he
   distinguishes the divine will from his own; this distinguishing,
   however, is possible, for the first man, only when the divine will
   presents itself to him as other than his own, as objective to
   him,--when God expressly reveals himself to him. On this definite
   distinguishing of one's own personal, from the divine will, depends all
   morality; a merely unconscious following of propension is not moral,
   but immoral. Man must become conscious that he does this or that act
   not simply because it pleases him, but that it pleases him because it
   pleases God. In this conscious, discriminating, free choosing of the
   divine will as distinguished from the merely natural individual will,
   man is expected to discover his essential difference from nature, his
   belonging to the kingdom of God; he is to learn to distinguish between
   "can" and "should," between his ability and his obligation, and thus to
   become conscious of his moral destination to freedom. Were the moral
   consciousness or the moral impulse inborn in man, then he could not
   come to a consciousness of his freedom--of his ability morally to rise
   above his merely individual being, and freely to choose the divine.
   Herein lies the high moral significancy of the notion of an historical
   divine revelation. In the interest of freedom, in the interest of the
   training of man into a moral personality, we would have been forced
   philosophically, to presuppose such a revelation, did we not already
   know of it from Biblical teaching.

    SECTION LXXVII.

   (b) The inner revelation of the holy will of God in the rational
   consciousness of man is not a mere instinctive impulse, as this is the
   characteristic of irrational nature-creatures, nor is it a mere
   feeling, inasmuch as this, so far as relating to spiritual things,
   always presupposes a knowledge, a consciousness, but it is a real
   consciousness, which, however, is at first only obscure and indefinite,
   and receives more definite contents only through educative revelation,
   whereby it is developed into full clearness. The inner and the
   objective revelations, though differing from each other as to the order
   of their taking-place and as to their form, do not differ in their
   essential contents, nor indeed as to their certainty; and the objective
   revelation is no more rendered superfluous by the inner one, than is
   the latter by the former; each mutually calls for the other.

   Just as the educative influencing of the child does not render
   superfluous its own active moral self-development, but in fact calls
   for the same as its end, and as the latter without the former is not
   possible, so is it also with the twofold revelation. If the historical
   revelation did not lead to a knowledge of the moral law as immanent in
   the reason itself, man would remain in perpetual nonage,--would not
   come to a consciousness of his rationality; in fact this revelation has
   its own withdrawal into the back-ground as its ultimate end,--as indeed
   since the accomplishment of redemption it has actually, in a large
   degree, so withdrawn.--By inner revelation, here, is not to be
   understood a real inspiration as in the case of the prophets, for this
   would in fact be supernatural and extraordinary; it is simply the
   gradual coming forward of the divine image in man,--the rational
   spirit's becoming-conscious of itself as such image. This
   becoming-conscious on the part of one's own rational nature is properly
   called a revelation, for the reason that this God-likeness is not
   conditioned by man himself but is created by God in the state of a
   germ, and is by the free activity of man, simply developed. The
   positive revelation is the light whereby this divine image, hidden in
   man's inner nature, becomes visible to his understanding, or more
   properly, it is the warming sunlight under whose influence the germ of
   rationality unfolds itself out of secrecy into day. The inner
   revelation is neither in antagonism to, nor is it identical with, the
   objective; it is no more in antagonism therewith than is man's own
   active self-development to moral maturity in antagonism with his
   training received from others; nor is it so nearly identical therewith
   as to amount to a repetition of the same thing. Their respective
   difference of origin continues to hold good also for the morally
   mature; even for the regenerated Christian, though he possesses the law
   of the Spirit as a living power within him, the historical revelation
   continues to serve as a permanent unvarying basis for the development
   of his moral consciousness, and as a sure criterion for testing the
   truth of the light within him; Christ came not to destroy the law.--As
   in their origin, so also in their form, they are different; the
   positive revelation bears a thoroughly historical character; the inner,
   a psychological. The former assumes the form of positive laws given at
   particular times, and through particular personal instrumentalities;
   the latter is continuous in every individual throughout his life.

   On this inner revelation through the God-likeness of the rational
   spirit the Scriptures lay some stress, notwithstanding that they speak
   of it simply in connection with man as perverted by sin, in whom the
   natural consciousness of God and of his will is seriously obscured and
   in need of special illumination,--for which reason the natural inner,
   and the supernatural inner, revelations are not strictly and formally
   distinguished. In allusion to moral wisdom, it is said: "It is the
   spirit in man, the breath of the Most High, that gives him
   understanding" [Job xxxii, 8; comp. Prov. xx, 27]; and it is prophesied
   of the new Covenant: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and
   write it in their hearts" [Jer. xxxi, 33],--as in contrast to the Old
   Covenant under which the law was predominantly objective and in sharp
   antagonism to the sin-blinded heart. But what is true of the New
   Covenant is likewise true of the unfallen state. This prophecy refers,
   it is true, to the working of the Holy Spirit, but unfallen man was per
   se already filled with this Spirit. Paul speaks of a natural
   consciousness of God and of the moral, even in the heathen [Rom. i, 19
   sqq.]; by how much more must this be true of man as unfallen. This
   natural God-consciousness is the general manifestation of that "life"
   which was the light of men [John i, 4].

   It is a favorite manner with some to speak of a moral "feeling," and
   even of a moral instinctive "impulse," as the primitive germ which
   subsequently develops itself into a moral consciousness. If by such
   feeling or impulse so much is meant as a knowledge as yet indistinct--a
   presentiment rather than a comprehension,--we can readily admit it,
   though in any case the expressions are very inappropriate, and serve
   only to confusion. Understood in their proper sense, we must
   emphatically reject them; for feeling is simply an immediate
   becoming-conscious of a state occasioned in the subject by an
   impression, and is hence always of a merely subjective and strictly
   individual nature, whereas the moral law is per se necessarily
   objective and universal--an idea; an idea cannot be felt, but must be
   known, though indeed this knowledge may be primarily as yet indistinct.
   A direct feeling can be occasioned only by a sensuous impression; of
   spiritual things I can have a feeling properly so-called, only after
   they have become an object of my cognizing consciousness; every feeling
   presupposes either a sensuous impression or an idea, a conception. To
   consider feeling, in the sphere of the religiously-moral, as the
   fundamental antecedent condition before all knowledge, is simply to
   confound an, as yet indistinct, anticipatory consciousness with feeling
   proper, and poorly serves to the attainment of scientific clearness.
   Still less can we speak of a moral impulse; in the strict sense of the
   word, as the primitive antecedent; an impulse that does not rest on a
   moral consciousness belongs not to the sphere of the moral but to that
   of the merely natural, and in the exact proportion that we attribute
   power to some such pretended impulse, we violate the freedom of the
   will. If an unconscious impulse toward the good is the primitive
   antecedent in man, then is a choice of the evil utterly impossible. If,
   however, we should assume, as the primitive condition, that there were
   in man contradictory impulses, the one toward the good, the other
   toward the evil, still we would not, by this anarchical duality,
   safeguard the freedom of the will, if we did not assume as above these
   mutually conflicting impulses, also a higher moral
   consciousness,--whereby in fact the hypothesis itself would be
   destroyed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    SECTION LXXVIII.

   The revelation of the divine will to the moral subject, as given in the
   rational self-consciousness, is the conscience. This is not an
   originally ready power, but, as given at first only in germ, it must be
   developed,--stands in need of culture, primarily by God himself, and,
   in all after the first generation. by the already morally-matured
   spirit of men; and with its further moral development it constantly
   becomes more definite, more clear and more rich in contents. Now, as
   sin separates man from God and from the knowledge of Him, and also
   damagingly affects the moral training received from others, it is clear
   that the conscience has its full purity and power only in a sinless
   state.--As relating to the moral life-manifestations, the conscience
   appears as a morally-judging power, and as such it is either in harmony
   with the particular manner of action--in which case it awakens a joyous
   feeling of approval,--or it is in antagonism therewith, and in this
   case it awakens a painful feeling of disapproval; and either feeling
   prompts to a corresponding course of action. As the conscience is a
   revelation of the moral law as the divine will, hence it never exists
   without a God-consciousness,--it is itself, in fact, one of the phases
   of this consciousness, and is per se of a religious character, and is
   inexplicable from the mere world-consciousness. In its germ it is a
   primitive and not a derived power, and in this sense it is already
   presupposed on the entrance of the positive divine revelation. The
   actual acceptance of this revelation is of itself already a moral act
   which presupposes the conscience; but the latter is excited to activity
   and to full development only by the positive revelation. Conscience is
   essentially an integral part of man's God-likeness,--is, like
   rationality in general, a divine life-power imparted to the creature.

   The conscience is in its essence, not different from the
   God-consciousness, but is only the bearing of the God-consciousness
   upon the moral; as relating to the good, it relates also to God, for
   none is good but God alone [Matt. xix, 17]; and God is the criterion of
   all good, for the good is the God-answering; a conscience which is not
   a God-consciousness is a perverted, an unanchored one. As the
   conscience is an inner revelation of God to man, we place its
   discussion in this section, although it is an essential element of the
   moral subject.--The manners of conceiving of the conscience differ very
   widely; it is, in turn, regarded either as a cognizing consciousness,
   or as a feeling, or as an instinctive impulse; and consequently it is
   sought for in all the different spheres of the soul-life; it is indeed
   true that the conscience cannot be real without embracing in itself all
   three of these spheres; and hence the word may be used in all three
   significations. In the expression: "Conscience says to me," or "it
   approves this and rejects that," it is conceived of as a cognizing,
   judging consciousness; but we also speak of a joyous, or a chastising
   conscience; and again we say: "conscience compels me to this act or
   deters me from it." The question, however, is: which of the three
   phases is the primitive, the fundamental one? which constitutes the
   essence of the conscience? According to what we have previously said as
   to the relation of feeling and willing to the cognizing consciousness,
   it follows very plainly that the essence of the conscience is to be
   found in that which its name directly expresses in various languages,
   namely, a being-certain, hence a certain knowing, a cognizing
   consciousness; in the New Testament the term suneidesis--(from sunoida,
   conscious sum, strictly: "I am a fellow-knower," and in a higher sense:
   "I know with God," in whom all knowledge centers),--an associate
   knowing with God, in virtue of his indwelling in rational creatures, is
   used of the conscience, both in so far as it leads to the good (agathe
   suneidesis, or kale or kathara), and in so far as, by reproving, it
   punishes evil [John viii, 9]; and the same word is used also directly
   in the sense of religious consciousness, presenting the conscience as a
   consciousness of the divine will [1 Peter ii, 19; Rom. xiii, 5; Heb.
   ix, 9]. The conscience, as differing from the enlightening influence of
   the Holy Spirit [Rom. ix, 1], is a power inherent in the essence of man
   per se, see Rom. ii, 14, 15; in this passage the logismoi are not the
   conscience, but the reflections that spring from the conscience, which
   itself is the "work of the law written in the hearts," that is, the
   consciousness of the contents, of the requirements of the moral law;
   Paul is not speaking here of the true and perfect conscience, but of
   the natural conscience of sinful man; the essential features of the
   true conscience, however, still lurk in the disordered one; and this
   essential character appears here evidently as a consciousness of the
   moral. In the Old Testament the conscience is designated by the word
   heart, lvv [Job xxvii, 6].

   The conscience is not a mere simple knowing, it is an utterance of the
   practical reason, a direct judging of moral thoughts and actions, an
   approving or condemning witness as to the moral conduct of man [2 Cor.
   i, 12; v, 11; Rom. xiv, 22; Acts xxiii, 1; xxiv, 16; 2 Tim. i, 3; 1
   Peter iii, 16; Heb. xiii, 18]. Such a judging presupposes the
   consciousness of a moral law, according to which the decisions are
   made; and this consciousness is the inner essence of conscience itself.
   The conscience is a judging power, for the reason that it is per se a
   consciousness of the law as the divine will; it utters itself
   discriminating and deciding (krinon) because it is mindful of the
   eternal ground of the holy,--because it is the inner essence of the
   divine image as coming to self-consciousness; this latter is the
   essence of the conscience, the judging is its active
   manifestation.--The conscience can be awakened, cultivated, and refined
   by human instruction, but not generated; it is a perpetual witnessing
   of God as to himself and his holy will in the rational spirit of man,
   and for this simple reason it is not within the control of man, but is
   a power above him; it may be silenced temporarily, and led astray in
   its particular utterance as a discriminating power, but it can never be
   eradicated nor definitively perverted. It is not the person, strictly
   speaking, who has the conscience, but it is the conscience that has the
   person; it dwells indeed in the individual personality, but it is not
   itself of subjective character, since it is of divine quality; it does
   not express my personal peculiarity, but the holy will of God in regard
   to me. Conscience is the fact of the divine morality in man antecedent
   to all human morality; it is the germ proper of man's
   God-likeness,--the God-likeness itself as bearing relation to free
   conduct, in so far as this consciousness constitutes a part of the
   essence of rationality. Without this divine germ of the moral in man,
   morality would be impossible--as impossible as is seeing without
   eyesight, no matter how much light there might be, or instruction
   without previously existing rationality as a basis. A convicting by
   argumentation is possible only when there is antecedently existing in
   the subject some certain knowledge wherewith the new truth shall agree.
   What axioms are in mathematics, that is the conscience in the moral
   sphere. He who does not recognize the axioms, and hence has, as it
   were, no mathematical conscience, is beyond the reach of instruction.
   He alone can become rational and moral, and live so, who is so already
   in the original structure of his being; and this deepest ground of
   moral rationality is in fact the conscience. He in whom the witness of
   the holy God does not witness for the holy, cannot be moral; but such
   an abandoned one there cannot be in the entire creation of God, for to
   none has he "left himself without witness." A man may become ungodly,
   may be unconscientious, and yet not be free from the power of
   conscience; he may deprive himself of his eyes, but not of his reason,
   and consequently not of his conscience. For this simple reason, every
   sin is a fall of man from his own proper nature, an unfaithfulness
   toward himself. Conscience rests on the. discrimination of the personal
   creature and its will from the personal God and his will; it finds its
   universal expression in the words of the Lord: "Not my will but thine
   be done." Whoever supposes himself to act from necessity, or merely
   according to his own individual will, for him the idea of the
   conscience is obscured; the irreligious are necessarily
   unconscientious. It is for the simple reason that it is not the
   individual ego, but the divine, that speaks in the conscience, that
   there can be a reproving, an evil, conscience, in which the difference
   of this twofold ego appears in an irreducible antithesis. But this
   voice of the divine ego does not first come to the consciousness of the
   individual ego, from without; rather does every external revelation
   presuppose already this inner one; there must echo out from within man
   something kindred to the outer revelation, in order to its being
   recognized and accepted as divine. Even as Adam at the first sight of,
   the woman recognized at once that she was flesh of his flesh, so
   recognizes man immediately on the utterance of the divine will by
   special revelation that this is spirit of that spirit which dwells and
   speaks within him,--not, however, as his individual ego, but as
   distinct from it, and as having uncontested right to rule over it.

   The first manifestation of conscience in the Scriptures appears in the
   words wherein Eve opposes the temptation: "We may eat of the fruit of
   the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the
   midst of the garden, God hath said: ye shall not eat of it." Here Eve
   distinguishes the command, as the divine will, from her own will; which
   latter, however, she afterward carries out; but this adversely judging
   conscience presupposes a previous first activity of the same, namely,
   the recognition of the divine command as obligating. The command itself
   spoke in fact, primarily, only to the understanding; the recognition of
   it as divine, as a legitimate determining authority for the individual
   will, the receiving of it into the heart, and the willingness to
   conform the individual volitions to it,--all this is not a matter of
   the cognizing understanding, nor in general of the individual spirit as
   such, but of that divine element in man which responds to the divine
   command--the conscience; and in the very first utterance of this power,
   it shows itself primarily, indeed as a consciousness, but then
   straightway also as a feeling of love as toward the congenial, the
   right, and as a willingness arising from this consciousness and this
   love.

   The cognizing activity of the conscience relates primarily and directly
   only to the God-pleasing, and not also to the God-repugnant; for the
   former is real, but not the latter, and all true and real cognition
   relates to something real. Hence the second phase of conscience, that
   where men's "eyes are opened" and they "know the good and the evil,"
   does not belong to the primative and pure conscience, but is a
   manifestation of the conscience as already in antagonism to the moral
   actuality of man. As primarily relating to the Godlike, and hence as
   attended by a feeling of approbation, the conscience has originally
   nothing to do with fear of punishment, but is on the contrary an
   expression of peace with God; fear presupposes already a disturbed
   harmony and a knowledge of good and evil; hence in the Scriptures we
   find conscience expressly distinguished from fear. [Rom. xiii, 5.]

   According to Rothe, conscience is the divine activity in its passive
   form, that is, it is the soul's self-activity as being determined by
   the body, or, in general, by material nature, and, in the final
   instance, by the divine self-activity, or, in general, by God
   himself,--that is, it is instinctive impulse as religious. In his
   opinion conscience lies not on the side of the self-consciousness, but
   on that of the self-activity, and relates not to conceptions and to the
   understanding, but to volitions and to actions. Conscience has
   essentially an individual character,--is of subjective, not of
   objective, nature; hence it is not correct to speak of a tribunal of
   conscience. "The conscience of another has not the least binding force
   for me, but only my own; when an appeal is made to conscience, there
   all further discussion is cut off, there all objective arguments become
   powerless; whatever is a matter of conscience to me is to me a sanctum
   sanctorum which none dare violate"--not even for objective reasons; nor
   does my conscience bind any one else. Conscience is essentially a
   religious instinct-impulse; and as being an activity of God in man
   under the form of an instinctive impulse, and hence also a sensuously
   perceptible one, it is attended by sensuously-somatic phases of
   feeling. Now every instinct-impulse is either positive or negative,
   hence conscience is either approbative or disapprobative; as
   disapprobative it is religious aversion,--an instinctive impulse toward
   the counterworking of the sin (hence stings of conscience); as
   approbative it is the religious appetite. Rothe takes occasion here to
   complain seriously of the hitherto prevalent confusion of phraseology
   on this subject,--namely, in view of the fact that conscience is
   treated of, sometimes as a propension, sometimes as a moral feeling,
   sometimes as a religious feeling, sometimes as such and such an
   instinct-impulse, or as such and such a sense; in this, however, he is
   manifestly unjustifiable; it is to no good purpose to quarrel with
   language which is, in fact, often profounder and truer than the boldest
   theoretical systems: No one has a right arbitrarily to define ideas
   contrarily to the general consciousness, and then to find fault with
   language because it does not harmonize with the definitions. In the
   present case we find language perfectly justifiable in making so wide a
   use of the term conscience, inasmuch as all the above phases are in
   fact embraced in it, though indeed not in equal degrees. The strange
   notion that conscience rests on a determination of the personal soul by
   the material body, so that by implication a rational spirit without a
   material body would not have any conscience, we pass over in silence,
   and make only the following observations. Should we admit that
   conscience relates to volition and action, it does not follow from this
   that it is not per se, and primarily, a consciousness; thought in fact
   may influence volition; and the necessary presupposition of every
   volition is a thought; but an unconscious instinct-impulse is neither
   religious nor moral, but irrational. The fact is, conscience lies most
   strictly on the side of the self-consciousness; otherwise an evil
   conscience could not contain a self-accusation. That the conscience is
   of subjective nature is only in so far correct as it constitutes an
   integral element of rational personality; but it is entirely incorrect
   in Rothe to reduce it to a mere individually-subjective phenomenon, and
   entirely to deprive it of objective character. If conscience is to be
   at all of a rational character, it must have a general, and hence also
   an objective significancy. That which is merely subjective has not the
   least moral significancy, rather is it the opposite of the moral; what
   is holy for me must be also holy per se and before God, and what is
   holy before God must be holy for all moral creatures. My conscience is
   true only in so far as it is an expression of the moral idea; but the
   moral idea is not of a merely subjective nature. For every Christian,
   it is a matter of conscience to follow Christ; this holds good in
   general as well as in particular, and not simply for me as such and
   such a particular person. The more the conscience bears a merely
   subjective character, the more defective it is; in a normal condition
   of humanity all moral consciences would necessarily be essentially
   concordant, inasmuch as there is only one God and only one divine will,
   and inasmuch as conscience is the expression of this will. Rothe comes
   himself into violent contradiction with his assertions, in that he
   makes conscience to be determined by a divine activity; for this divine
   activity must be objective to the subject; and, as of a holy character,
   it certainly does not determine each individual to a different
   decision: and a little farther on Rothe himself takes this position:
   that the conscience as an activity of God in man, has a direct and
   unconditional authority, and from which man cannot in any manner
   escape; that arguments avail nothing as against conscience,--that
   perfectly convincing arguments may be urged and yet the conscience
   remain unmoved; that consequently conscience is also infallible, that
   it never deceives and is incapable of being bribed; and that though we
   may blind ourselves as to its decision, yet it is itself not to be
   deceived. These positions, so utterly extreme and so contrary to all
   experience, are manifestly irreconcilable with his previous position,
   namely, that conscience, being entirely devoid of objective character,
   is a mere subjective phenomenon; for in the notion of an authority in
   conscience, and especially of an unconditional one, it is manifestly
   implied that the subject is subordinate thereto. [9] --According to
   Schenkel (Dogmatik, 1858, I, 135 sqq.) the conscience is a special
   faculty of the human soul, or rather that one of its organs which has
   to do with religious functions, whereas the reason and the will do not
   relate directly to God but to the world; this conscience, in which the
   God-consciousness is primarily and immediately given, is at the same
   time also the ethical central-organ. What is to be gained by this freak
   of fancy it is difficult to determine. When men thus arbitrarily, and
   contrary to prevalent usage, limit the notion of the reason and the
   will, it is of course an easy matter to discover new faculties of the
   soul and new organs of the same; but whether anything important is
   gained thereby, and whether the supposed epoch-making new discovery
   will meet with much favor, we may seriously doubt.--Trendelenburg shows
   much more circumspection and acumen in considering conscience as the
   reaction and pro-action of the total God-centered man against the man
   as partial, especially against the self-seeking part of himself
   (Naturrecht, 1860, § 39).

II.--THE ESSENCE OF THE MORAL LAW AS THE DIVINE WILL.

  SECTION LXXIX.

   The essence of the moral law as the divine will cannot be deduced from
   the nature of man alone, but essentially only from the idea of God as
   ruling righteously in his creation.--(a) As morality rests on freedom,
   and as freedom consists in the fact that a man chooses, by a personal
   independent volition, a particular mode of action among several
   possible ones, hence every moral action is at the same time the leaving
   undone of a possible contrary action. The moral law is therefore per se
   always twofold; it is command and prohibition at the same time, and
   consequently there is in fact no essential difference whether the law
   appears in the one or in the other form; and as the moral life of man
   is a continuous one, hence he must at every moment of time be
   fulfilling a divine law; a mere non-doing would be a negation of the
   moral. It is in consequence of the freedom of choice, and not in
   consequence of sinfulness, that the divine law bears the form of a
   "should."

   Every presentation of the moral law from the stand-point of man alone,
   that is, purely from the nature of man, without deriving it from God,
   is anti-religious, and can never include the whole truth of the moral
   idea. And in precise proportion as we conceive more highly of the moral
   nature of man from that stand-point, we render unavoidable his
   Pantheistic exaltation into the highest realization of God himself--the
   putting of man in the place of the personal God. We cannot possibly
   understand the moral law save as the divine purpose in regard to free
   creatures, and we can base it on the nature of man only in so far as we
   recognize in and through this nature the divine creative will, the
   fulfillment of which lies in the realized moral perfection of man.

   The fact that any particular action is morally good, necessarily
   implies as possible a contrary, or non-good one; and the commanding of
   the former is per se a prohibiting of the latter; every command
   directly implies the prohibition of the contrary form of action. Now it
   might seem as if the converse did not hold good, namely, that a
   prohibition does not imply at the same time also a command; the laws:
   thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, seems to require
   simply a non-doing. This, however, would be possible only on condition
   that a mere non-doing were in general a moral possibility. But as life
   is strictly continuous in all of its stages, and as even a momentary
   real cessation of life is death, hence least of all can the highest
   form of life, the moral life, be a non-living, a simple non-doing,
   without thereby turning into the contrary, namely, into spiritual and
   moral death. As the human spirit, even in the deepest sleep as
   conditioned by the weariness of the body, is never idle, but keeps up
   an activity in remembered or unremembered dreaming, so also the highest
   form of spirit life, the moral life, is never interrupted by a pure
   inactivity. Hence a prohibition that should include in itself no
   contents of a positive character, no command, could not be of a moral
   nature. The moral non-doing of a morally prohibited action is in and of
   itself necessarily the doing of the contrary. Hence, Luther, in his
   elucidation of the Commandments, is strictly right in never leaving
   them in the form of a simple "thou shalt not;" but in uniformly
   deducing from them a very positive "thou shalt." The law: "thou shalt
   not kill," though in form a simple prohibition, nevertheless directly
   implies the enjoining of all that man, in his intercourse with others,
   ought to do as contrasting with the disposition that leads to murder;
   we should not only not kill our neighbor, but we should help and succor
   him in all his bodily perils;--a mere non-doing in the face of such
   perils would be a direct violation of the law. If man is not to commit
   adultery, then must he, in the conjugal relation, not only not do any
   thing that stimulates and nurtures an adulterous disposition, but he
   must do the contrary thereof; that is, he must live purely and chastely
   in words and acts, and love and honor his own consort.

   Nevertheless it is not indifferent as to which of the two forms the
   moral law assumes; the difference, however, lies not in the essence,
   but in the practical educative adaptation. As the essence, the end, of
   the moral life is not negative but has positive contents, the true and
   perfect form of the law is in fact that of the express command; "thou
   shalt" is higher than "thou shalt not." But for man while as yet
   undeveloped to moral maturity, the form of prohibition is the more
   obvious and simple, since, on the one hand, it brings his moral liberty
   of choice more clearly to his consciousness, and, with the exclusion of
   the immoral, opens to him the whole field of the discretionary, and
   since, on the other, it establishes protecting limits for the field
   within which he is to train himself up to moral maturity, to a
   consciousness of the good. With the child, education always begins in
   the prohibiting of what conflicts with its well-being; God's first law
   to man was a free throwing-open of the field of the discretionary in
   connection with a limiting prohibition [Gen. ii, 16, 17], whereas the
   real command appears primarily only in the general form of a blessing,
   as expressive of the goal of moral effort, the good [Gen. i, 28]. While
   the Mosaic Commandments bear predominately the character of
   prohibition, Christ sums up the moral contents of the divine law in the
   form of a positive command: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself;" and at the same time Christ
   declares that this command embraces the whole ancient law. Hence, while
   the essence of the divine law continues ever the same, the revelation
   of it gradually advances from the predominantly prohibitory form to
   that of the positive command.

   As both forms of the divine law present a duty to the free will of man,
   they both bear the expression of a command, a "should." This is the
   form assumed by nearly all laws, from the first one given to Adam to
   the perfect laws of Christ. Since the time of Schleiermacher, however,
   many take offense at this "should," and strive to banish it, at least,
   from the pure moral law. In Schleiermacher's Philosophical Ethics, this
   rejection of the "should" is entirely consequential; for here the moral
   is quite as necessarily-determined a phenomenon of the universe as is
   the natural, and for freedom of will there is no place whatever;
   consequently ethics has no other task than simply to describe that
   which takes place from necessity, but not to present laws under the
   form of requirements, of duty. Rothe follows this view only up to a
   certain point; he rejects the form of the "should" only for sinless
   man, as indeed also one cannot apply the idea of "should" to God; only
   for sinful man can the moral appear as a duty (Eth. I, Auf., § 817). As
   relating to God this is doubtless correct, inasmuch as God's freedom is
   not human liberty of choice, and as it absolutely excludes the
   possibility of sinning, and since God is absolutely his own law. But as
   relating to free creatures, even though they be as yet perfectly
   sinless, it is erroneous,--at least unless we are to regard the moral
   perfection of the same as a cessation of all freedom of choice and
   likewise of all moral duty. As long as man does not cease to propose to
   himself moral ends, and freely to aim to reach them, so long will duty
   as yet continue. This form of the law would be unsuitable for perfect
   man only when it should be conceived of as something uncongenial to
   man, as some sort of oppressive yoke, which, however, is by no means
   the case. The as yet unrealized state of a freely-to-be-attained goal
   always implies a "should." It is only from some such misconception as
   if the "should" implied something foreign and burdensome to man, that
   we can explain why even Harless limits the application of this word to
   the fallen state (Christl. Ethik, 6 Auf., p. 80 sqq.). There is,
   however, no shadow of censure in the form "thou shouldst;" in fact,
   there is for the free will no other form of law conceivable than that
   of the "should." Without a distinguishing of the divine will from that
   of the subject, no real conscious morality is possible; and simply this
   distinguishing and nothing more--not an antagonism of estrangement--is
   contained in the idea of the "should." It is in this idea in fact that
   morality and piety find their unity, the moral being conceived as the
   divine will [Deut. x, 12; Micah vi, 8]. The child that does the good
   for the reason that it knows that it is the will of its parents that it
   should do so, stands morally higher than the one that does it without a
   consciousness of its duty; the former, but not the latter, is able to
   offer resistance to temptation; for temptation is overcome only by the
   thought of the divine will, or of duty. A command does not presuppose a
   contrary inclination, but only the possibility of sin, that is, it
   presupposes freedom of will. In denying to man while as yet in a
   sinless state all consciousness of the divine law, and supposing him to
   act simply from a direct impulse of love, we not only contradict the
   express declaration of the Scriptures as to a revelation of the divine
   will to primitive man, but we also render the fall into sin an
   impossibility.

  SECTION LXXX.

   (b) Whatever is morally good is God's will, and is hence also moral
   law; and this law has, as God's will, an unconditional claim,--presents
   itself always as a requirement from which there is no escape, and
   cannot possibly be construed into a mere counsel the non-fulfillment of
   which would not be a sin, and the voluntary fulfillment of which would
   constitute a supererogatory merit. The moral goal of every human being
   is moral perfection, and all that conducts thereto is for every such
   being an absolute duty, that is, it is God's will and law concerning
   him. No one can do more good than is required of him; for the human
   will cannot be better than the divine, and God's law is not less good
   than God's will. That which in the Scriptures has the appearance of
   real moral counsel is simply a conditional law, the fulfillment of
   which becomes a duty to the individual only under certain, not
   universally-existing, circumstances; but wherever it does become a
   duty, there it is so absolutely, and hence its non-fulfillment is a
   violation of duty; and wherever it does not become a duty there its
   fulfillment has no merit.

   Here, for the first time, we meet an antagonism of moral views between
   the different Christian churches; and it is a far-reaching one; and
   from this point on, in our attempt to construct a system of Christian
   ethics, and not simply of the ethical views of this or that church, we
   must seek for the essence of Christianity, not merely in those
   generalities which are common to all particular churches, but, wherever
   two views are in irreconcilable antagonism, we must necessarily decide
   for that one which is of a really Christian character, and cannot
   regard both as equally legitimate. And although. the question in this
   connection is nearly always, as to counsels to redeemed Christians,
   still it properly belongs in this place, since in fact unfallen man
   would be, even much more than the redeemed, in a condition to obtain a
   higher merit than is strictly required.

   On a superficial examination it might seem that by the dogma as to the
   evangelical counsels (consilia as distinguished from praecepta) the
   moral requirements were advanced higher than the generally-sufficient
   degrees of morality; the fact is, however, the very opposite. The
   notion that there is some good which is not also a duty, can only be
   obtained by lowering the moral requirement from that of the highest
   possible moral perfection to an inferior requirement; and a
   supererogatory merit becomes possible only where the idea of the good
   embraces more than the moral requirement. The Protestant church,
   however, holds fast the view that all real good is absolutely a duty,
   and hence that man is obligated to do all the good within his
   power,--that he should unconditionally strive for the highest possible
   perfection. The Protestant view as to the moral requirement stands
   therefore higher than the opposing view. The Protestant church rejects
   the notion of moral counsels, and of the meritoriousness of their
   fulfillment, for the reason that it regards their contents as not
   absolutely good, as not per se moral, but as only good under certain
   not universally-existing circumstances, but as absolutely commanded
   when those circumstances do exist. That which is good in a particular
   conjuncture is, when that case arises, an absolute duty, and not a mere
   discretionary and non-obligating counsel. The saying of Christ [Luke
   xvii, 10]: "When ye shall have done all those things which are
   commanded you, say: we are unprofitable servants,"--which is not
   designed to disparage the worth of true morality, but simply to lead
   man to humility by reminding him of his sinful state, and of his
   redemption by grace alone,--is, however, applied by the theologians of
   the Romish church to the doctrine of the evangelical counsels, in that
   they say that man should in fact not remain a mere unprofitable
   servant, but should be a child of God, as indeed also Christ was not an
   unprofitable servant; and even some Protestant exegetes try to escape
   this inference simply by referring the works here in question not to
   Christian morality, but merely to the Mosaic law. We regard both the
   inference, and this mode of escaping it as inadmissible. It is indeed
   true, man should not be simply an unprofitable servant but a child of
   God; but from this very fact it follows that that which morally
   conditions this filial relation to God, must also be a positive moral
   requirement and duty, and not a mere counsel, which we may leave
   unfulfilled and yet not fail in doing all that is actually required of
   us; man is in fact absolutely bound to become a child of God. Now as a
   limitation of these words of Christ to the Mosaic law is not justified
   by the context, seeing that just previously (verses 5, 6) the question
   had been as to the power of faith, hence their true scope is, we think,
   as follows: man, even though redeemed but not yet free from sin, is
   unable by his dutiful works to acquire merit before God in such a sense
   as that he could claim of God the blessedness of the children of God as
   a reward due, and which God would be required by his justice to grant,
   but on the contrary he can regard this blessedness only as a gracious
   gift conferred upon him in virtue of his faith in the compassionate
   love of God in Christ. To the works owed, it is not other non-owed and
   hence supererogatory works that are compared, but faith, which, though
   indeed also a moral requirement, yet differs essentially from works
   properly so called (comp. verse 19; "thy faith hath made the whole").
   Christ's utterance, therefore, teaches clearly the very opposite of
   sanctification by works as prevailing in the Romish church.

   The Romish church finds further support for its supererogatory good
   works,--which consist essentially in intensified self-denial, that is,
   in voluntary celibacy, poverty, obedience to man-devised rules,
   solitary life, etc.,--in those texts of the New Testament which seem to
   present celibacy and voluntary poverty as a higher morality not to be
   expected of all Christians. To the rich young man, who, as he himself
   affirmed, had kept all the commandments, Christ says [Matt. xix, 21]:
   "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast,--and give to the
   poor, and then thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow
   me." Now, it is argued, the moral law does not in fact require of all
   men the giving up of their possessions, and yet this young man had
   fulfilled all the commands which Christ mentions to him; hence this
   giving-up was over and above these commands. This is a very unfortunate
   inference, for surely a morality which does not lead to the perfection
   of man, can hardly be pure and required by God; and in the case of this
   young man the giving-up of his riches was the condition of his
   perfection, and hence, as we hold, an unconditional requirement, in
   case he really desired to attain to the highest good. The young man in
   declining the requirement failed, as Christ says, to have part in the
   kingdom of heaven; all his presumed fulfillment of the law was
   insufficient. Now this is in plain antagonism to the Romish doctrine,
   according to which the fulfillment of the law, even without obedience
   to the counsels, is amply sufficient to a participation in the kingdom
   of heaven, whereas the supererogatory works simply serve to a more
   speedy attainment thereof, or to a higher degree of blessedness. Hence
   those who refuse to admit that certain particular actions become a duty
   only under particular and not universally-existing relations, but that
   when these do exist, then they become in fact a positive requirement,
   would have no other alternative left, than to regard the requirement
   made of the rich young man as a general duty for all Christians. We can
   distinguish universally-valid commands from conditional ones, not,
   however, moral commands from mere counsels. Also the conditional
   commands are, when the particular conjuncture arrives, of absolute
   obligation, and not to fulfill them is disobedience to God's command;
   whereas, in the Romish view, the non-fulfillment of the counsels does
   not incur the least moral blame.--When Paul says of himself [1 Cor. ix,
   12-18] that he has denied himself many things to which he had a right,
   that he has labored without charge, etc., the Romanists here find a
   supererogatory work to which the Apostle was not obligated. Paul,
   however, declares expressly that he so acted in order "not to abuse his
   power [liberty] in the Gospel." Now if the taking advantage of his
   discretionary power, under these particular circumstances, would have
   been a misuse of his liberty, then the course of action adopted by the
   apostle was evidently simply his duty, and by no means a supererogatory
   work.--But the greatest emphasis is placed on the utterances of Christ
   and of St. Paul as to abstaining from marriage: "All cannot receive
   this saying, but they to whom it is given" [Matt. xix, 11]. Now, that
   those who do not receive the saying can be believing Christians who
   attain to the kingdom of God, although not to that higher stage of
   salvation which is conditioned on supererogatory works as Romanists
   understand it, is not only not said, but, to the contrary, it is said
   that the self-chastening in question is done "for the kingdom of
   heaven's sake," and hence plainly in the sense that the same is a
   condition of attaining to the kingdom of heaven. But the opera
   supererogationis of which one is found here, are not regarded as a
   condition to participation in the kingdom of heaven. When Paul [1 Cor.
   vii] commends to Christians to abstain from marriage, this is certainly
   not offered as a universally-applying command, but manifestly as a mere
   counsel (comp. verse 12), not, however, in such a sense as that
   individuals may disregard it at perfect pleasure and without moral
   detriment. On the contrary, the apostle expressly gives the ground of
   his advice: "I suppose that this is good (kalon) for the present
   distress;" "such (as marry) shall have trouble in the flesh; but I
   spare you." From this it follows that where such a "present distress"
   does not exist, or where there is full moral power and readiness to
   endure the worldly trials, there the advisableness of celibacy no
   longer applies. In general the principle is valid: "If thou marry thou
   hast not sinned" (verse 28); but in every definite case the duty
   becomes definite also. Where there is such a pressure of "distress,"
   and where higher duties are to be fulfilled, and there is not
   sufficient power to bear the worldly trials without danger to
   faithfulness, there to marry is not only not a mere non-sinning, and
   abstaining from marriage a good counsel, but the former is a positive
   sin, and the latter a duty. And wherever any one, in view of these
   particular circumstances does remain unmarried, he does not thereby
   acquire a higher, a supererogatory desert, but he simply fulfills his
   duty. Such a supererogatory desert is moreover directly excluded by the
   fact that the apostle proposed by freedom from marriage to preserve the
   Christians, in that time of distress, from temporal "trouble;" now he
   who renounces an otherwise legitimate privilege in order to be spared
   from worldly trouble, cannot possible lay claim to a special higher
   desert and to a special recompense for the same. In fact, we can
   readily conceive of cases to the contrary, where the greater desert
   would consist precisely in the assumption of these trials by marrying,
   and where therefore to marry would be a duty.

   According to the Romish doctrine there is a difference between God's
   holy will and his moral law; the former has not an unconditional
   validity, but is, in relation to man in the sphere of higher moral
   perfection, simply a wish the fulfillment of which would indeed be
   pleasing to God, but with the non-fulfillment of which He will
   nevertheless be satisfied. Bellarmin says, apropos to Matt. xxii, 36:
   "He who loves God with his whole heart, is not bound to do all that God
   counsels, but only what He commands,"--an assertion that must appear to
   an evangelical conscience as a reversal of the moral consciousness.
   Hirscher, in his earlier writings, defended this doctrine thus: "Love
   is a command given to all without exception, whereas a specific degree
   of love is not commanded; rather is love, when once really existing,
   left to its own nature; it in fact presses forward of its own
   prompting, and it is inconsistent with its inner nature that the rude
   hand of a command should impose upon it that which it will always
   freely bring forth from its own heart; hence love is in general an
   absolute duty, not, however, a specific higher degree of love; the
   absence of the higher degree does not involve also an absence of
   righteousness in general, but only a certain higher range of the moral
   affections; so was it with the rich young man in the Gospel." Now, all
   this is manifest sophistry. It is true the degree of love cannot, for
   every particular case, be stated in a particular legal formula, still,
   however, this degree is an absolute duty; it simply depends on the
   spiritual and moral culture of the individual, but is in no case left
   to individual caprice. Whoever loves God or Christ, or father, mother,
   or consort less than his moral culture enables him to do, simply
   commits sin; and he who loves with all the capacity of his soul does
   not do any thing supererogatory, but simply his bounden duty; and it is
   nearer the truth to say that all will have to accuse themselves of
   loving too little, than that any single soul may boast of loving God
   more than with the "whole heart and soul and strength." (In the fifth
   edition of his Moral, II, p. 328 sqq., Hirscher so tones down the above
   teaching that only a mere shadow of it remains.) The Romish doctrine,
   in making perfection dependent on the fulfillment of the counsels,
   implies thereby that God's will, as expressed in the moral law, is not
   that man should be perfect, but it is on the contrary rather an
   individual courage transcending the mere will of God, that leads him
   out beyond the moral goal set for him by God himself. [10]

  SECTION LXXXI.

   (c) While, on the one hand, there is no form of action which could be
   to the subject, in any given moment, morally indifferent, that is,
   neither in harmony nor in disharmony with the divine will, neither good
   nor evil, still, on the other hand, no definitely-framed form of law
   embraces within itself the total contents of the moral life-sphere; for
   as every law has only contents of a general character, while the moral
   activity itself is always of an individual character, so that the moral
   actions of different men that fall under the same moral law offer a
   great diversity, hence the moral law does not sustain to the actions
   that answer to it precisely the same relation as an idea to its direct
   realization and manifestation; the particular moral action is not the
   simple, pure expression and copy of the moral law itself, but it always
   contains something which does not arise from the law, but from the
   individual peculiarity. The law as appropriated by the person is
   fulfilled only in such a manner as expresses also the peculiarity of
   the person. Every moral action contains therefore two elements: a
   general ideal one, the moral law, and a particular and inure real one,
   the personal element,--which latter, as the expression of the
   personally peculiar character, has also its perfect legitimacy. God's
   moral will is not that men should be mere impersonal, absolutely
   similar expressions of the moral law, but that the latter should come
   to its realization only as appropriated by the particular personality.
   This personally peculiar element that inheres in every actual moral
   action cannot be embraced in any general legal formula, inasmuch as in
   its nature it is in fact not general, but a pure expression of
   individual personality. Every real moral activity is therefore the
   product of a twofold freedom: of that which subordinates the individual
   personality to the law, and of that which does not merge the
   personality into a mere abstract idea, but preserves it in its
   legitimate peculiarity, and which is to a certain extent a law unto
   itself.

   By this notion of the right of personality Christian Ethics differs
   from all non-Christian systems, not excepting those of the Greeks,
   notwithstanding that the latter lay such great stress on the freedom of
   the person; and this feature is of wide-reaching significance. The
   decided rejection of the notion that there may be morally-indifferent
   actions and conditions, and the emphasizing the rights of personal
   individuality, are very essential to a true understanding of the moral.
   By insisting disproportionately on the former, we leave too little room
   for the peculiarity of the moral personality, and make it necessary
   that for every particular action there should be also a special law;
   this leads inevitably to a legal bondage hostile alike to all vital
   individuality, and to the essence of personal freedom. This is the
   stand-point of Chinese and of Talmudic ethics, and to a certain extent,
   of the casuistics of some Romish moralists. On the other hand, if we
   insist too exclusively on the peculiarity of the person, we incur the
   danger of trespassing on the unconditional validity of the law, to the
   profit of the fortuitous caprice of the subject,--somewhat as recently
   in the period of the so-called "geniuses" and of the genius-less
   freethinkers who followed them, all morality was made to consist in the
   uncurbed development of the fortuitous peculiarity of the individual,
   to which peculiarity every thing was freely allowed provided only that
   it was "genial." The only true course is, in harmony with the general
   Christian consciousness, to hold fast to both of these elements.

   At each and every particular point of time, the moral activity and the
   moral state are either good or evil, either in harmony with the moral
   idea or not so. Although in the same action there may be different
   phases which have morally different characters, and which place good
   and evil in close proximity, still these contrary elements never
   coalesce into a moral neutrum, into a morally-indefinite fluctuating
   between good and evil--a moral indifference. An individual may indeed
   be morally undecided, neither cold nor warm; this indecision, however,
   is not of a morally-indifferent character, but is itself evil. There
   may be different degrees of good or evil, but not an action that is
   neither good nor evil. This will become self-evident if we fix our mind
   on the fundamental idea of good and evil as that which answers to, or
   does not answer to, the divine will; between these two a third is
   absolutely inconceivable, just as in mathematics there is no medium
   between a correct and a false result, or in a clearly presented legal
   case no medium between yes and no. The bride who cannot answer "yes" to
   the question as to her willingness to the marriage, says thereby, in
   fact, "no;" and whoever does not at any given moment say "yes" to God's
   never neutral will, simply rejects it. The essentially
   self-contradictory assumption of a morally-indifferent middle-sphere
   between good and evil, is in itself anti-moral; and every immoral
   person is only too ready to transfer all his immorality, in so far as
   he cannot explain it into good, into this pretended sphere of the
   morally indifferent.

   And yet this so widely prevalent tendency to assume that there is a
   morally-indifferent sphere of action, is based on an actual, though
   falsely interpreted, presentiment of the true relations in the case.
   The fact is, every feature in correct moral action is not directly and
   specifically determined by the moral law, but a very essential phase of
   such action, has another source than the general law; nor is the truly
   moral man simply a mere expression of the moral law, but, as differing
   from other equally moral men, he is entitled as a person to have and
   retain his special peculiarity. This phase of the moral life appears at
   once, and very clearly, in that which lies at the basis of all moral
   society--wedlock-love. Love, and, more specifically, conjugal love, is
   a moral command; but the fact that this love fixes itself exclusively
   and continuously upon precisely this particular person, is a
   personally-peculiar shaping of the moral law; no law can prescribe what
   particular person shall be the object of my conjugal love; and the
   personal element is here so manifestly legitimate that the eliminating
   of it--the indulging in love, not to a particular personally-chosen
   person, but to the other sex in general--results in "free" love, the
   very quintessence of immorality and vulgarity. Wherever moral theories
   ignore the rights of personality, there the tendency is very strong to
   base marriage, not on personal choice, but on the choice of the State,
   as in ancient Peru. Now, what is true of conjugal love is true also,
   though not always in such striking consequences, of all moral activity.
   When two equally moral persons do the same thing, fulfill the same law,
   it is, after all, not the same action; nor indeed should it be; what is
   right and good in one person may, in that particular form, be even
   wrong in another, notwithstanding that the moral law is the same for
   all. Paul employs his moral activity in a different manner from that of
   Peter and James; in fact, in the living communion of Christians there
   is presented not only a great diversity of spiritual "gifts," but also
   of personally-moral idiosyncrasies; even in the purely spiritual sphere
   there are manifold gifts, but only one Lord. The normal difference of
   moral life-tendency as seen in the sons of Adam, and which must have
   occasioned as great a difference in the fulfilling of the moral
   commands as it did in the manner of offering worship, presents a type
   of the manifold moral diversities into which the moral law is shaped by
   peculiarities of personality.

   The virtualization of the personal element is not to be understood as a
   something conflicting with the divine law; on the contrary, it is in
   fact the divine will that the peculiarity of the personality be
   preserved. If, at first thought. it should seem questionable to place
   along-side of the universally-valid law another essentially variable
   element, lest thereby the unconditional validity of the law be
   infringed upon and negatived, let it be observed, in the first place,
   that the personal peculiarity finds in the moral law both its limits
   and its moral criterion, so that consequently it can never come into
   antagonism with the same, but that, nevertheless, there is, within the
   scope of the personal spiritual life, a field into which the law,
   because of its general character, does not dictatingly enter. So long
   as the moral consciousness is not yet truly mature, there is, indeed,
   in the personal element of the moral, a peril for the moral life,
   inasmuch as the law cannot give specific directions for every special
   case. Hence in the Old Testament God complemented his earlier
   legislation by special revelations of his will through priestly and
   prophetic inspiration; now, however, since the Spirit of God is poured
   out upon all men, there is no longer any need of this extraordinary
   revelation of the divine will in individual cases, for now the human
   personality, having come into possession of the truth, has also become
   "free indeed,"--is so imbued with the divine law that, in loving and
   acting as prompted by its divinely purified heart, it fulfills the
   divine law in the very fact of developing its personality; and, in
   fulfilling the law, it preserves also at the same time its personal
   peculiarity,--as, for example, in a happy marriage there is no longer
   any antagonism between the fulfilling of the will of the one party by
   the other, and the acting-out by each of his own personal peculiarity,
   but, on the contrary, in each of the two elements the other is already
   implied. And the moral unripeness of individual persons, that
   necessarily still exists even in a normal condition of humanity, is
   complemented to full moral safety by the spirit of the moral
   community,--as in fact this thought is vitally embodied in every true
   Christian church-communion.

  SECTION LXXXII.

   The sphere of the personally-peculiar element is that of the
   discretionary or the allowed. That particular action which is neither
   commanded nor forbidden in general by any moral law is an allowed
   action; this circumstance does not, however, by any means make it of a
   morally-indifferent character; on the contrary, the morally-allowed
   belongs per se to the morally-good in so far as the development of
   personal individuality is per se legitimate and good. The idea of the
   allowed relates therefore less to the moral activity per se and in
   general, than rather to the peculiar manner in which an end that is per
   se good, that is, correspondent to the moral law, is realized in
   particular, by virtue of the personal peculiarity of the actor; and the
   same moral law may be fulfilled in many ways, the moral quality of
   which, however, is conditioned in each particular case by the said
   peculiarity. There is nothing that is allowed under all circumstances;
   and all that is allowed, and all so-called indifferents (adiaphora) are
   in each particular case either good or evil, but never morally neutral,
   notwithstanding that such actions may be per se, that is, generally
   considered, morally undetermined, and neither commanded nor forbidden.
   The moral quality lies not so much in the action objectively
   considered, as in the disposition from which it springs and by which it
   is attended.--The sphere of the allowed is different for every stage of
   the moral development and for each particular circle of life. The
   farther the moral development of the person has progressed, that is,
   the more the moral law has become identified with his personality, so
   much. the higher will also be the rights of his personal individuality,
   so much the higher the morally-personal freedom, and consequently so
   much the wider also the sphere of the allowed; to the pure all things
   are pure. Free movement within the sphere of the allowed is therefore
   essential to a truly moral life, and conditions the all-sided
   development thereof; this movement is per se good, and it is in itself
   a good, the significance and compass of which increase with the moral
   development of the subject. Herein lies the contrast of the Christian
   freedom of the Gospel to the bondage of the law.

   This is one of the most important and, at the same time, most difficult
   points in ethical science, and both for the same reason, namely, from
   the necessity of giving play to personal freedom, and of doing this
   without infringing on the unconditionally-valid moral law; and in exact
   proportion as a system of ethics embraces the idea of personal freedom,
   will it also be able to embrace the idea of the allowed. As in express
   laws--commands and prohibitions--God manifests himself as holy, so in
   the concession of the allowed he shows himself as loving. As in the
   fulfilling of the command and in the observing of the prohibition, man
   becomes conscious of his moral freedom, so, within the sphere of the
   allowed, this freedom becomes to him an enjoyment. Now, as freedom of
   will is not a mere antecedent condition of all morality, but also
   itself a moral good, and as every good is per se an enjoyment, hence
   free-created beings have also a moral claim upon the legitimate
   enjoyment of freedom,--not simply of freedom as subject to definite
   commands, but also of freedom as entitled to free choice in various
   directions,--that is, they have discretionary power to free activity;
   this constitutes in fact the divinely conceded sphere of the allowed,
   wherein mainly the personally-peculiar element of the moral comes to
   virtualization.

   The very first moral direction, or rather blessing, that was given to
   man, contains implicitly the notion of the allowed or discretionary:
   "Replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of
   the sea," etc. This is really not so much a command as a blessing,--it
   proposes a moral goal, a good. But in this good that is to be sought
   after, namely, dominion over nature, there is at the same time implied
   a command to realize this supremacy of the rational spirit through
   moral activity. But within this command there lies also a discretionary
   field. The particular manner how man is to realize this dominion, is
   not expressed in the command, but is left to his free personal
   self-determination--in so far as he does not thereby come into
   collision with other moral commands. Thus, man may use animals for his
   own purposes, may domesticate them, train them, force them to help him.
   and use them for his nourishment; but as to what choice of them he
   shall make, and as to what kind of service he shall exact of them, this
   is left to his discretion,--here he may act freely, here he has the
   full enjoyment of his freedom. For unfallen man there was no need of
   narrower limits; but when depravity gained the upper hand these limits
   were drawn closer, and the Mosaic law gives very specific and narrower
   bounds within which man, as no longer morally stable, was to exercise
   his freedom upon nature.--The first definite command of God presents at
   once, along-side of the expressed command, also the allowed: "Of every
   tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the
   knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat;" whatever he may choose
   of the other trees is per se good; the choice he shall make is not
   prescribed; simply a boundary is set, beyond which begins evil. Now, we
   cannot say that this choosing within the given limits is of a
   morally-indifferent character; rather is such choice, as the
   realization of a good, itself morally good; and this goodness, consists
   in the simple fact that every choice is good, and that the choice of
   the one is not better and not worse than the choice of the other. To
   infer from this that the single objects of the choice are morally
   indifferent, would be to overlook the fact that the moral element does
   not lie in the object, but in the choosing person, and that the latter
   exercises his morality precisely in the fact of freely choosing in
   accordance with the peculiarity of his personality; not to choose at
   all would be to despise the divine gift, and hence immoral.

   In the state of innocence the sphere of the allowed was,
   notwithstanding the indispensable educative limitation, wider than it
   was subsequently in the state of sin, not, however, because men were
   then morally more contracted, but because they were morally purer. In
   consequence of redemption from the power of sin, the now sanctified
   personality becomes also freer, and the sphere of the allowed is
   enlarged; herein lies one of the most essential differences between Old
   Testament and New Testament ethics. The moral itself receives, in
   contrast to the specifically and particularizingly prescribing ancient
   law, a more general form, and the whole law and the prophets are summed
   up in one short command: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, and thy neighbor as thyself." The sanctified personality acts
   within the limits of the law with more freedom; the boundaries of the
   allowed, as established for the state of sin, are thrown more into the
   back-ground; the laws as to the Sabbath and as to meats and other
   similar prescriptions, are thrown into a freer form by the personality
   as made free in Christ. Instead of the limiting laws regulating the use
   of "meats," and other material objects in general, and which were
   framed with reference to the sinful impurity of man, Christ gives the
   broad principle: "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man,
   but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man" [Matt. xv,
   11]; and Paul expresses this in a still more general form: "Every
   creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received
   with thanksgiving" [1 Tim. iv, 4]; and elsewhere [Titus i, 15] he
   states the thought in its highest exaltation: "Unto the pure all things
   are pure;" that is, the higher the morality rises, so much the wider
   becomes also the sphere of the allowed, and hence of freedom; and upon
   him who is morally perfect, who is inwardly fully identified with the
   divine will, there is no longer imposed any degree whatever of
   outwardly-legal limitation to the employment of his freedom; for
   whatever he can love, that God loves also, and his sanctified
   personality cannot choose any thing that would be offensive to
   God,--and such a person is again invested with his original full right
   of dominion over nature, with his full right of free choice; and
   whatever he does of free choice, that he does to the glory of God [1
   Cor. x, 31].

   The words of Paul [1 Cor. vii, 28] may serve as a further illustration
   of the notion of the allowed: "If thou marry, thou hast not sinned;"
   whereas on this very occasion the apostle dissuaded from marriage. The
   Christian has a right to marriage; whether, however, under
   circumstances that would otherwise morally admit of it, he put into
   execution this right, does not depend on any particular legal
   prescription, but on his own untrammeled personal choice. Paul had
   discretionary "power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other
   apostles" [1 Cor. ix, 5]; but he did not do so; all have the "power to
   eat and to drink" [verse 4], but our choice is, within particular
   limits, left free. Ananias was at liberty to keep his field or not
   [Acts v, 4]; what he did was of his own election; it was not a moral
   law, but solely his personal choice that determined his conduct. [Comp.
   1 Cor. vi, 12; x, 23; Rom. xiv, 1 sqq.; xv, 1 sqq.; Matt. xii, 3, 4.]

   The sphere of the allowed is the more special theater of personal
   freedom, as distinguished from mere moral freedom. In obedience to the
   commanding law I am indeed free, but this freedom is nevertheless a
   controlled one; it is true, I can will and act otherwise than the law
   wills, but I dare not; and if I in fact do so, then I violate the law,
   then I am an enemy of God; I have the liberty but not the right so to
   act. Commanded duty has consequently, notwithstanding the liberty on
   which it rests, always still a certain constraint in it; and though in
   the mere literal fulfillment of the law, man becomes conscious of his
   freedom, yet he does not come to a proper and full enjoyment thereof.
   If God's law actually entered, prescribing and prohibiting, into all
   the details of individual action, without, by some concessions,
   allowing play-ground for discretionary action, then, though man would
   indeed have the privilege of freely obeying or disobeying at each
   particular moment, nevertheless he would feel the law as a burden upon
   him; and Paul was very apt in expression when he spoke of the
   preparatory law of the Old Covenant as a chastening-master. For the
   simple reason that the essence of man is freedom or self-determination,
   it is natural for him to aspire to become also fully conscious of this
   freedom,--to put it into exercise in so far as consistent with his
   moral obedience,--and hence he needs a free field wherein he may act
   with real freedom, without having his actions in every respect
   prescribed to him, without being strictly bound by the law,--where, in
   a word, he may say: I may choose this, but I do not need to choose it;
   and whether I choose this or that depends entirely on my personal
   self-determination, and that too without detriment to my moral duty.

   The sphere of the allowed stands in the same relation to that of the
   express law as play to earnest activity. Play also is an element
   essential to the full development of youthful moral life. With the
   child, play is of high moral significancy, as it is thereby that it
   learns to comprehend, to exercise, and to enjoy its full personal
   freedom. In learning and working the child is also free; but however
   good and zealous of work it may be, it is nevertheless conscious at the
   same time of being controlled by an objective law to which it must
   adapt itself; the other and equally legitimate phase of its life, that
   of personal freedom and self-determination, is revealed to it in its
   purest form only in play; and the child, even the morally-good one,
   finds so great a delight in play, for the simple reason that it thereby
   comes to the enjoyment of its personal freedom; and the essence of its
   enjoyment lies in the simple fact that in its playful activity and
   feats it is free lord of its own volitions and movements; and those
   children become spiritually dull whose plays are strictly watched over
   by tutorial intermeddling. Playing is freedom, however, only in form,
   and is without definite contents; hence it is essentially only a
   transition-occupation appropriate to the age of childhood. The sphere
   of the allowed in general, is the wider and positive-grown extension of
   that play. Here belongs recreation after labor, as in contrast to the
   positive fulfilling of the law; recreation is per se morally good and
   its essence consists in freedom; that I select precisely this path for
   a promenade, or busy myself thus or thus, is neither prescribed to me
   by any law, nor is that which I do not select forbidden. It is entirely
   erroneous to say that man must be totally swallowed up in his calling,
   that he has a definite duty to fulfill at every moment; this would be a
   moral slavery. The sphere of personal liberty has also its own good
   right, and for the plain reason that man is not merely an obligated
   member of the whole, but also a free individuality. Recreation per se
   is therefore by no means of a morally indifferent character, but the
   particular mode of its realization is discretionary, and the moral law
   is not, at this point, of a detailed particularizing character, but it
   simply hovers protectingly on the outskirts, and wards against
   abuses,--even as a prudent educator simply exercises a protecting
   oversight over the child's play, but does not prescribe the details.
   Man is indeed moral at every moment of his existence, and should at
   each moment be and act morally right. but every thing that he does is
   nevertheless not a direct expression of some moral formula, on the
   contrary there is a share therein that belongs, and rightly too, to
   personal free choice,--just as, in regard to his clothing, a sensible
   man, though in the main following the prevalent mode, will nevertheless
   reserve the privilege of deviating therefrom whenever it better suits
   his personal individuality.--Even as a fish in the water, though indeed
   swimming according to the natural laws of gravitation and motion, yet,
   within the scope of these laws, disports itself at pleasure, and
   exhibits precisely in this free motion the traits which distinguish it
   from the unfree plant, so also does man, within the limits and
   conditions of the moral law, comport himself freely on the field of the
   allowed, and in so doing manifests the characteristics of the free
   child of God as in contrast to servitude under a chastening law.

   Schleiermacher (Werke III, 2, 418 sqq.) denies the admissibility of the
   notion of actions that are merely allowed. We have, in his opinion, no
   time for that which claims to be, not duty, but simply allowed, not
   morally necessary, but only morally possible; every performance of such
   an action implies a definite willingness to act otherwise than from
   moral motives,--which is immoral; the idea of the allowed belongs not
   to ethics but to civil law. This we concede in so far as Schleiermacher
   speaks of such actions as are held to be neither in conformity nor in
   disconformity to duty, that is morally indifferent, but this is by no
   means the true idea of the allowed. However, we do not admit the
   existence of such a class of actions; but in morally-good actions there
   is a phase which is not determined by the law itself, and which
   constitutes the allowed.--Rothe (Ethik, 1 Auf. § 819) finds the idea of
   the allowed in the fact that particular forms of action cannot be
   referred with certainty to a particular legal formula, so that
   consequently their moral worth cannot be estimated thereby beyond a
   doubt. The reason of this may lie in the incompleteness of the law;
   hence the allowed has a larger scope in the minority-period and with
   children; but as the law becomes more definite and perfect, the sphere
   of the allowed grows narrower; the more fully man is as vet without
   positive law, so much the more numerous are the actions that are
   allowed to him; but there arrives a turning-point in the development
   where the relation again changes, and for the reason that, then. the
   law begins to retire into the background and to become progressively
   simpler, so that the sphere of the allowed becomes again more
   extensive. With this view of Rothe we cannot coincide. According to it
   the sphere of the allowed rests only on a lack of the law, and it
   would. be more properly termed the sphere of the morally doubtful.
   Adam, however, to whom the allowed was at once presented in connection
   with the commanded and the prohibited, could not possibly be in doubt
   as to what would be moral for him; and the divine word placed before
   him with perfect definiteness the sphere within which he was allowed
   entire freedom of action. And it is utterly erroneous to say that in
   childhood the sphere of the allowed is wider than in maturer years. The
   fact that many a thing is allowed to the child which does not become it
   in later years, is not a proof that it has a wider liberty, but only
   that at this period the allowed lies in a different circle, and one
   that answers to the childish understanding; on the contrary, the fact
   undoubtedly is, that to the child more things by far are not allowed
   which are allowed to the man, than conversely; and every wider stage of
   development brings to the youth a consciousness of an increased freedom
   of self-determination, although, on the other hand, it is true that the
   more earnest demands that are made by the growing positiveness of the
   life-work, exclude much of the earlier childish liberty. But that there
   comes again afterward a turning-point when a contrary relation begins,
   cannot be substantiated, and moreover it conflicts directly with the
   idea of a constantly progressive development toward moral
   maturity.--With a similar tendency, Stahl (Rechts-philos. II, 1, 112)
   transfers the allowed beyond the sphere of the ethical proper, as being
   in its fulfillment morally indifferent, and into the sphere of
   satisfaction, that is, of earthly enjoyment; hence he infers
   consistently enough, that the sphere of the merely allowed must
   constantly decrease as morality advances, and that satisfaction is
   ultimately to be sought only in that which is at the same time a
   fulfilling of the moral law,--as, for example, in the exercise of
   benevolence, etc. Christian Friedrich Schmid arrives at the same
   conclusion (Sittenl., p. 450 sqq.). According to this view the sphere
   of the allowed would amount in fact but to a sphere of the non-allowed,
   and would be simply a temporary concession to moral immaturity and
   weakness. This seems to us incorrect. For a truly rational man, there
   can be no other satisfaction than a moral one; whatever he does and
   receives, he does and receives in faith and love and with thanksgiving,
   and in virtue of this thankfulness every truly allowable enjoyment
   becomes invested with a moral character. Stahl appeals to the fact
   that, with the progress of moral development, many a thing that is
   otherwise allowed must be renounced; but this is only in appearance a
   greater limitation; for though it is true that mature man no longer
   allows himself many of the pleasures of his unripe youth, yet he has in
   their stead other and wider fields of the allowed which are denied to
   youth. The greater freedom of the Christian as compared with the
   law-observer of the Old Testament, is perfectly evident. It is true,
   many things were allowed to the Jew, which, because of the higher
   morality introduced, are no longer allowed to the Christian, such as
   the putting away of wives, and retaliation [Matt. v, 31 sqq.], so that
   it might seem as if the sphere of the allowed, and hence of personal
   freedom, were really more narrowly limited in Christianity than in
   Judaism. However, when we reflect upon the above-cited declarations of
   Paul as to the contrast of Christian freedom to the yoke of the law,
   the matter will doubtless appear in reality very differently. Many
   things were not indeed morally allowed to the Jews, but only tolerated
   in them, because of their hardness of heart; the whole significancy of
   the moral law was not yet exacted of them, just as in children many a
   thing is tolerated and overlooked because of their more limited moral
   knowledge, which in riper persons would be regarded as improper and
   blameworthy, without implying, however, that that which is tolerated is
   actually admitted as allowable. The fact is, that as the moral
   consciousness grows in clearness, the compass of duties grows wider
   also, so that many a thing that was not previously a moral requirement
   now becomes really such. This does not, however, render the sphere of
   the allowed narrower, but in fact wider, inasmuch as every duty admits
   also of a variety of ways of fulfillment, and consequently also a
   diversity of ways of virtualizing our personal peculiarities. Thus, the
   fact that consorts may no longer discard each other, though at first
   sight a seeming limitation of the sphere of the allowed, yet really
   greatly exalts the moral personality of both parties; they have by far
   a higher right in each other,--may require more of each other, may more
   strongly emphasize the right of their moral personality, may each allow
   to the other, and to himself toward the other, more than would be
   proper were marriage merely an easily-dissolved contract,--even as the
   son of the house is freer and may allow himself more liberty than the
   servant, and for the simple reason that the former is more indissolubly
   united with the house than the latter;--the closer and firmer the bond,
   so much the greater mutual trust and confidence, so much wider also the
   sphere of the allowed.

   Writers often admit two different species of the allowed: the one is
   allowed because of the meagerness of the moral knowledge, as with the
   child; the other, conversely, because of the advanced state of the
   moral maturity. This difference, however, is by no means a real one;
   and, when expressed in this form, the idea of the allowed has no longer
   any unity, but involves a direct antagonism. Rather do both of these
   forms of the allowed fall under the one notion of the rights of the
   personal peculiarity. Many things are, for the peculiar nature of the
   child, morally good, which are not so for a riper person, and for the
   simple reason that the unsuspecting child, in doing that which would be
   improper in those of riper years, "thinketh no evil," and because the
   sentiment holds good also of unconscious innocence, that "to the pure
   all things are pure." And the case is essentially the same with him who
   is morally matured; simply the form is different. When man has come,
   through moral growth, into a state of conscious innocence, then also to
   him, as being pure, many a thing is pure which would be impure to the
   sinful.

  SECTION LXXXIII.

   In so far as the moral law is made into a moral possession of the
   person, that is, a constituent element of his personally-moral nature,
   it becomes to him a moral principle, a life-rule or maxim; without
   moral principles there is no real morality. As in this union with the
   personal peculiarity the moral law itself enters into this peculiarity,
   hence though it is in fact the same always and for all men, still the
   life-rules that grow out of this law, among different persons and
   nations and under different conditions in life, must evidently also be
   relatively different. The correct shaping of the moral law into
   life-rules correspondent to the peculiarity of persons and
   circumstances, constitutes the principal work of practical wisdom.--A
   disregarding of the rights of the personal peculiarity in the moral
   life, and the exclusive application of general and definitely-expressed
   laws as direct rules of life, result in a servitude to a legal yoke
   (rigorism) which is incapable of producing any truly personal morality,
   and has no justification save as a temporary disciplinary process in a
   state of depravity.

   The law is not of man, but solely of God; life-rules each person makes
   for himself, not, however, independently of the law, but as based on
   it, though peculiarly modified by his moral personality. The life-rule
   or maxim is the law as incarnated, as having become subjective; in it
   man has appropriated the law as a personal possession,--has merged it
   into his flesh and blood. My life-rule, even in so far as it is
   perfectly correct, is valid in this definite form only for me, and it
   may legitimately enough be widely different at different life-stages
   and under different circumstances. The manifoldness of life-rules
   contributes to the esthetic richness of the collective life of the
   race; in them the moral idea, though essentially one, yet shapes itself
   into a variegated diversity, just as the light of day, though in itself
   essentially colorless, is reflected back from flowers in a thousand
   varying tints. It is true, the giving scope here for freedom of will
   involves also a possibility of immoral self-determination; and it is
   also true that sin, in consequence of its essential deceptiveness,
   seeks almost always to hide itself under the cloak of pretendedly
   legitimate life-rules, and thereby attains to its seductive power, and
   that the free personal shaping of the moral law into life-rules is
   possible without danger, only as proceeding from pure and sanctified
   human nature, so that consequently the severe discipline of the
   tutorial law appears as peculiarly appropriate for the divine training
   of mankind before the full realization of redemption; but wherever
   morality is to become perfect, that is, free, there the law itself must
   become an inner freely-appropriated one,--must be received into the
   personality as its essential possession, and not as a foreign element,
   but as one that has coalesced with its essence; and this essence is a
   personally-peculiar one. Even as natural nutriment does not nourish in
   its natural crudeness, but only in so far as it is received and really
   appropriated into the natural organism and into its peculiarity, so is
   it also with the moral law. From the possible danger of subordinating
   the unconditional validity of the divine law to individual caprice,
   there does not follow a condemnation of the personally-peculiar molding
   of the law, but only the requirement that morality be based not on
   merely unconscious or obscure feelings or impulses, but upon a positive
   clear consciousness of God's will and of one's own moral condition. The
   non-governing of one's self, the yielding of one's self to immediate
   natural impulses, the giving rein to the spiritual and sensuous
   proclivities that already exist irrespective of a knowledge of the
   divine will, is per se, even where sin does not yet exist as a power of
   evil, immoral. Moral life-wisdom is not an acquisition attained to in
   unserious play; and slavish submission to an all-specifying, rigorous
   law is easier than the free, moral developing of life-rules on the
   basis of the more general moral law. The less ripe the moral
   personality, so much the more dictating must be the objective character
   of the law, so much the more severe must be its discipline [Gal. iii,
   24]; and the riper the moral nature of the person becomes, so much the
   more freely and independently may and should he shape the law into
   life-rules for himself.

   It creates confusion to confound the moral law with personal
   life-rules; it inevitably leads either to legal bondage or to moral
   laxity. The Scriptures contain not only moral laws, but also life-rules
   for particular, not generally existing life-relations, and the
   regarding these latter as general moral commands or counsels has
   sometimes led Christian ethics into error. When the apostle recommends
   celibacy because of the "present distress" [1 Cor. vii,] he gives
   simply a life-rule for particular, expressly-stated circumstances; and,
   in order to prevent all misunderstanding, he says, in relation to the
   unmarried: "I have no commandment of the Lord" [verse 25]. By this,
   Paul does not mean that he establishes on his own authority a new
   command without reference to any divine law, but only that this
   specific life-rule is not itself a divine law, but rather simply a rule
   of conduct applying the divine law to particular circumstances. The law
   on which it is based, however, is not: "Thou shalt not marry," but:
   Care for the things that belong to the Lord, and not for the things
   that belong to the world [see verses 32, 34]. Monasticism made of this
   life-rule an objective law or counsel. The instructions of Christ to
   the apostles, when sent out to prepare the way for himself [Matt. x, 9
   sqq.]: "Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses,"
   etc., are not given as a moral rule to the moral man in general, but to
   the apostles for this specific mission. But the mendicant orders made
   of this also an objective law. When Christ required of the rich young
   man to sell all that he had and give it to the poor, it is perfectly
   evident that this was simply a specific injunction for this particular
   person, seeing that neither Christ nor the apostles required in all
   cases, or in any manner, the giving up of possessions, notwithstanding
   their strong emphasizing of the duty of charity [Acts v, 4; 1 Tim. vi,
   17 sqq.; 2 Cor. viii, 1 sqq.]. The monastic vow of poverty is a
   perverted application of this injunction. To the same category belong
   the rules of propriety for women, as given in 1 Cor. xi, 5, 10 sqq.,
   and in part evidently also the resolution of the Apostolic Council
   [Acts xv, 20, 29]. In all such rules either the assigned or the
   directly implied reference to particular, but not generally existing
   and permanent relations and circumstances, distinguishes them very
   readily from general moral laws, the characteristic of which is to be
   valid absolutely and always.

  SECTION LXXXIV.

   The moral law as (by virtue of the particular form into which it is
   thrown by the peculiarity of the moral person) requiring its
   realization in a particular case, is moral duty; duty is, therefore,
   the law as coming to actual application in moral action through the
   moral life-rules into which it has been shaped by appropriation into
   the moral person,--that is, it is the law as realizing itself under the
   form of life-rules, in other words, it is the law as shaping itself in
   and for a particular person under particular circumstances, and as
   becoming in him a determining and actuating power. I fulfill the law in
   that I do my duty. The duties that spring from the same law are
   different for different men and for different circumstances.--As,
   therefore, duty is the product of two elements, the moral law and the
   peculiarity of the person, and as the moral laws collectively, though
   existing under the form of a plurality, must yet of necessity
   constitute a concordant whole, hence, if we leave out of view the
   actuality of sin, a conflict of different duties with each other
   (collision of duties) is utterly impossible. The distinction of
   conditional and unconditional duties is not correct, and rests on a
   confounding of the notions of law and duty.

   The moral person does not directly and strictly fulfill the law, but
   simply his duty. Even ordinary speech indicates the difference; we do
   not say, "my law," but always, "my duty." The law per se is general and
   above man; duty is always special and personal. No one person can do
   the duty of another; and what is duty for me, may be a violation of
   duty for another. The law alone is directly prescribed; to what
   particular form of action this law, as appropriated into my
   personality, determines or obligates me, is not directly expressed in
   the law, but is the result of a moral judgment in view of my special
   moral peculiarity and circumstances. We cannot, therefore, with
   propriety institute a contrast between conditional and unconditional
   duties. The condition is already implied in the relation of the
   fulfillment of the law to the fulfillment of duty; what I may not or
   cannot now do, is simply not my duty; at another time, however, this
   same form of action may become my duty. Any and every duty may, with as
   much propriety, be called conditional as unconditional; in its becoming
   a duty it is always conditional; whenever, however, it actually
   presents itself, there can no longer be any question of conditionality.
   Whoever is in a condition to rescue a person from imminent life-peril,
   has the unconditional duty of doing so; whoever cannot do so, has no
   duty whatever in the matter; between these two positions there is no
   third one possible. With like propriety we may say also that the law is
   at the same time conditional and unconditional, but in a converse
   relation; in its essence it is unconditional, in the manner of its
   fulfillment it is always conditional. The law, "Thou shalt love thy
   neighbor as thyself," is in its moral contents unconditional; every
   human being is an object of this love, but how this love is to be
   exercised, in what manner it is actually to manifest itself in actions,
   that is, to what definite duties it shall lead, this depends on
   manifold conditions not contained in the law itself; to one's husband
   or wife, or to parents, one owes a very different love from that due to
   friends, and the very same sacrificing love will manifest itself very
   differently toward the moral and toward the immoral.

   When the law is presented in the general form of command or
   prohibition, the manners in which the manifold relations of life make
   it the duty of different persons to fulfill it are so different, that
   there may even arise an appearance of contradiction. The fact is,
   however, that for a real conflict (collision) of duties (a subject
   which has from of old been a favorite and much discussed one among
   moralists) there is in a normal state of humanity no possible place.
   Moral laws cannot come into conflict with each other, otherwise the
   idea of the moral, and the moral order of the universe itself, would be
   undermined; and there is just as little ground for a conflict between
   duties, seeing that their conditionment is in fact based in part on the
   personal peculiarity and special circumstances of the subjects. The
   personal peculiarity of a sinful man may indeed come into conflict with
   the moral law; but in so far as this is the case it forms no legitimate
   element in the construction of the notion of duty; rather will it
   become our duty in many respects to counteract this element. But all
   legitimate personal peculiarity is itself formed in harmony with the
   moral idea, and hence cannot come into conflict therewith. For an
   irreconcilable collision of duties there is, therefore, nowhere any
   manner of possibility.

   The idea of duty is often otherwise understood than as here presented.
   Duty is frequently declared to be the divine law itself. Now if by this
   is meant, that which God requires of us in each particular case, and
   that too of each individual in particular, then it would be
   correct,--this, however, is not expressed by the term "law;" but if it
   means, that duty and the divine law are identical, then it is
   incorrect. More definite is the statement, that duty is the manner of
   action which conforms to or harmonizes with the law. The Kantian school
   explains duty as that which, according to the law, should take place,
   or which, by virtue of a law, is practically necessary, or which
   answers to an obligation,--obligation being understood as the necessity
   of an action in consequence of a moral law. All these statements are
   inadequate, inasmuch as the personal peculiarity is left out of the
   account, so that consequently no difference whatever is made between
   duty and law; and as to how obligation differs from duty we are utterly
   unable to see. Schleiermacher in his System (§ 112 sqq.) defines duty
   as "the form of conduct in which the activity of the reason is at the
   same time special, as directed upon the particular, and also general,
   as directed upon the totality," or, the law of the free
   self-determination of the individual in relation to the common moral
   life-task of the race, or, the formula for the guidance of rationality
   in single actions in the realizing of the highest good. That these, in
   the main, correct statements, are still too indefinite, is shown even
   by their numerousness. Similarly, but more definitely, Rothe explains
   duty as that definite form of action which is required by the moral law
   as under the form impressed upon it by the individual instance.

  SECTION LXXXV.

   To duty on the part of the moral subject, corresponds right on the part
   of the law. My duty is to fulfill the right of the moral law, that is,
   the right of God to, or his claim upon, me. The substance of dutiful
   action is therefore justice or right, and the product of this action is
   the right, i. e., the realized claim. Hence dutiful action is per se
   right-doing. Duty and right call for each other,--are but two phases of
   the same thing; to every right there corresponds a duty, and
   conversely,--simply the subjects are different; every duty is the
   expression of a right; another's right in regard to me is for me a
   duty, and to the fulfillment of another's duty in regard to me I have a
   right; the two ideas are absolutely correlative and co-extensive. In
   virtue of duty I accomplish the moral, for the law has a right, a
   claim, upon me; in virtue of right the moral is accomplished upon me;
   in the fulfilling of duty I keep the law; in my accomplishing of the
   right the law keeps me. The fulfilling of my duty obtains for me a
   right to, or claim upon, the moral law in so far as this law is an
   element of universal order, namely, the right to be a real, living, and
   hence free, member of the moral whole,--in other words, a. moral claim
   on the just recompense of God. There is, morally, no other right of an
   individual than such as is conditioned by a corresponding fulfillment
   of duty on his part; rights without duties would be a reversing of
   moral world-order. God has an absolutely unlimited right because he is
   absolutely holy, and man, as related to God, is under absolute
   obligations. All right has therefore its basis in God's right and in
   God's love. Hence in the Scriptures the notion of duty is nearly always
   presented as an indebtedness,--as the right of God to man, as what man
   owes to God. God's righteousness has a right to righteousness in man,
   and hence righteousness is man's duty; those who fulfill their duty are
   therefore the righteous.

   As duty is not merely of a subjective character, a mere utterance of
   the individual consciousness, but the law as appropriated by the
   person, so also, and equally emphatically, is right also not a mere
   subjective something with no better basis than a merely fortuitous
   power of the individual. Every right of the individual is a special
   expression of the right of the whole, and is valid only in so far as
   this individual is in moral harmony with the whole. Whoever by
   undutiful conduct dissolves his union with the moral whole, loses
   thereby, in like measure, his right to or claim upon the whole. Duty
   and right are both an expression of the moral; the former is the moral
   as subjective obligation, the latter is the moral as objective
   requirement; both manifest the essence of the moral as an essential law
   of collective being. The individual has duties and rights only as in
   vital union with the whole. I have duties and rights, not in virtue of
   being a mere individual, but in virtue of the fact that the totality of
   being bears a moral character. From this it follows at once, that there
   can be true duties and rights only where the morality of the whole is
   based, not merely on the morality of the individual persons,--which
   would be a mere arguing in a circle,--but where it is based on the
   holiness of the personality of God. I can keep and fulfill the law only
   when the law keeps and fulfills me; I can do my duty only when I
   therein recognize a right or claim of the moral whole, and hence of the
   holy God, upon me. An impersonal whole has no right to, nor claim upon,
   the personal spirit; from such a servitude Christianity has
   definitively emancipated human thought; nor has one man, as upon his
   fellow, any other right or claim than such as he derives from God; that
   is, he has it only by the grace of God; that man has per se a right
   upon his fellow, irrespective of God, is an un-Christian view; "Be not
   ye the servants of men" [1 Cor. vii, 23]; this is Christian right and
   Christian freedom.

   In such a moral world-order where duty and right are absolutely
   correlative, where right extends as far as duty, and duty as far as
   right, every one receives strictly his own right--his due. The dutiful
   man has a right upon the moral whole,--a right to have his personality
   respected,--and it is thus that the moral law, the moral world-order,
   realizes itself on man; it upholds in a just and honorable position him
   who has upheld it. He who gives honor to God, to him God gives also his
   honor. Also he who violates duty receives his right; every punishment
   is the fulfilling of the right of God and of the collective universe
   upon the individual; the criminal has a right to the punishment; when
   the criminal comes to his right mind he demands himself his own
   punishment, and a child that is not totally perverted finds a moral
   tranquillization in suffering the punishment it deserves,--it even
   calls for it.

   The notion that the fulfillment of moral duty acquires for man a claim
   upon the moral order of the world, and hence upon God, is emphatically
   rejected by Schwarz (Eth. I, p. 199), who even declares such a view as
   blasphemous; God alone, he holds, is the absolutely-entitled One; man
   has, as toward God, simply duties, but no rights; God only can have
   claims upon us, not we upon God. And he appeals for support to Rom. ix,
   20; xi, 35 sqq.; Job ix, 12; Luke xvii, 10. The first two passages,
   however, relate to the impossibility of fathoming the eternal divine
   counsel, and declare any doubt as to God's holiness and righteousness
   as unjustifiable; moreover all of them relate exclusively to the
   condition of sinfulness, in which we of course concede, in harmony with
   Scripture, that all salvation rests exclusively on the undeserved and
   compassionate mercy of God. We are now speaking, however, of man as not
   yet under sin, of the moral life in its unclouded purity, and here the
   matter stands very differently. If God's righteousness is not a mere
   empty figure of speech, it must form the basis of a moral right; we
   cannot doubt that God rewards each according to his moral conduct; and
   when a truly moral creature receives from God a just reward [Rom. ii,
   6, 7, 13], this is not a mere compassionating gift, but it is justice,
   and the creature has, in virtue of his righteousness, a claim upon such
   a reward. It is indeed a gracious gift of the Creator, that he has made
   the creature thus noble, that it is permitted to bear in itself God's
   own image; but that God regards and treats the creature that has become
   positively holy, in view of and in reference to that fact, is simply
   justice. As the sinner receives but his right when the divine
   punishment falls upon him, so also the sinless creature receives but
   his right when he is an object of the divine pleasure. To think
   otherwise on this point would be to overthrow our notion of a holy and
   just God. The Scriptures express very distinctly this thought of the
   right of the moral person upon God, even in circumstances where,
   because of sin, there can no longer be any question of a right strictly
   speaking,--so that, then, it is in fact a pure grace that God,
   notwithstanding this, yet concedes to man such rights. Of the
   justifying faith of Abraham, Paul says, "To him that worketh is the
   reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt" [Rom. iv, 4]; if therefore
   man should really and truly fulfill the law of God, then his reward
   would fall to him in due course of justice. The inference of the
   apostle, as to the worth of faith for sinful man, would not have the
   least basis should we presume to regard this declaration of his as per
   se meaningless and impossible; and this holds good in the fullest sense
   of man as untouched by sin, as also it is true of the Son of man. The
   true and real fulfilling of the law has in fact eternal life as its
   just reward [Matt. xix, 17]; the only question is, as to whether in
   fact any person perfectly fulfills the law as Christ did. The doctrine
   of grace for the redeemed is not interfered with by that of a claim of
   the moral man upon God, but receives in fact thereby its proper
   foundation. In the idea of the Covenant which God made with the
   Patriarchs, and as to which he himself says: "I have made a covenant
   with my chosen, I have sworn to David my servant: Thy seed will I
   establish forever," etc., there is contained also the idea of a right
   upon God as graciously conceded even to sinful man, provided he should
   obey the voice of God and keep his commandments [Psa. lxxxix, 4; Exod.
   ii, 24; xix, 5; Deut. vii, 8, 9, 12; ix, 5]. That God should make such
   a covenant, is pure grace; but now that He, the truthful One, has made
   it, it follows that those who keep it acquire thereby a right to its
   fulfillment on the part of God; and hence the pious of the Old Covenant
   make appeal in their petitions to the promises of God [Gen. xxxii, 12;
   Exod. xxxii, 13; Deut. ix, 26 sqq.]. The great emphasis which the
   Scriptures place upon the thought of the covenant of God with man,
   which is, in fact, more than a promise, implies very clearly that here
   the moral character of God, as well as that of man, is essentially
   involved. We need only separate from the idea of a right all that the
   sinful heart has associated therewith, all that is presumptuous and
   self-seeking, and it will no longer have the least feature that could
   give offense to the most reverential mind. The Scriptures present the
   thought of duty as intimately connected with the idea of right; and
   this involves, in fact, the profoundest conception of the moral. Here,
   all dutiful living, on the part of man, is a right of God upon him
   (mspt), a paying of his debt to God,--it is hopheile,--and man is
   debtor to God and to the brethren [Rom. i, 14; viii, 12; Luke xvii, 10;
   comp. 1 Cor. vii, 22]; and God's laws are an expression of the rights
   of God [Lev. xviii, 4, 5; xix, 37; xxv, 18; Deut. vii, 12; xxxiii, 10;
   Psa. xix, 10; 1, 16; cv, 45; cxix, 5 sqq.; Isa. xxvi, 9; and others].
   By virtue of his moral nature, of the likeness of God that was
   impressed upon him, man becomes in turn a debtor,--is under obligation
   to bring this nature into realization, to fulfill the claim or right of
   God upon him; and he who fulfills this right is consequently just or
   righteous; "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good (the moral law);
   and what doth the Lord require of thee (as duty) but to do justly (the
   right) and to love mercy?" [Micah vi, 8; comp. Deut. x, 12, 13]. Thus,
   as it appears, the Scriptures present rather the objective phase of the
   moral, the right of God and of the divine law upon man; whereas the
   moralists of recent times, especially since Kant, devote their
   attention rather to its subjective phase, as duty.

   In the manner of viewing the relations between right and duty there
   often prevails some confusion; right is often confounded with
   discretionary power, whereas, in fact, the former is more than the
   latter, and contains an actual requirement; or, right is regarded as
   the mere possibility or liberty to act. Furthermore a great difference
   is frequently made between right and the right, the two being taken as
   capable of excluding each other, so that I may have a right and yet its
   execution be not right. This, in so far as the question is as to moral
   right, is manifestly absurd. It is true, according to civil law, I may
   have a so-called right in the exercising of which I shall do wrong; but
   of such civil right we are not here speaking; in the sphere of morality
   I can never have a right to what is wrong, and I can never exercise a
   right without doing the right. I have a right only in so far as the
   moral law takes me under the protection of the moral order of the
   universe; I have a right upon another in so far as he has a moral duty
   to fulfill toward me; I have right conduct in so far as I myself
   realize the moral law; and this I do in fact when I do not throw away
   my own moral right, but maintain it intact. Whenever I have a moral
   right, then is it also right to realize it.

CHAPTER III.

  THE OBJECT OF THE MORAL ACTIVITY.

  SECTION LXXXVI.

   As the moral is the free realizing of the good, and as the good itself
   is the inner law and nature of the divinely-created All, hence, in
   every moral activity, man comes into relation to this All, and this
   All--as well as also God himself--becomes in its entire existence, so
   far as within the scope of man, an object of the moral activity,
   namely, either in that as a good it is brought into unity with the
   moral person, or appropriated by the same,--or in that, as material
   capable of being modified, it is formed by the moral activity.

   I. The moral life relates primarily always to God. God can be an object
   of the morally-pious activity only in so far as he is conceived of as a
   personal spirit; to an impersonal God there can be no moral relation.
   This moral activity is not a mere receiving, but it is a real acting,
   namely, in that man not only turns himself toward God, but in that he
   also turns God toward himself; the good that is realized by this
   activity becomes actual, however, not in God, but in us, in that it
   brings us into communion with God, so that consequently all pious
   activity is at the same time a moral producing for ourselves.--As God
   upholds, and rules in, all creatures, hence all moral activity without
   exception stands in relation to God, and all realizing of the good
   works communion with God. All that is moral is also pious, and all that
   is pious is also moral. Hence all duties are also duties to God, and
   religious duties do not stand along-side of other duties, but they
   include them in themselves.

   Every view is defective which excludes from the moral life any thing
   whatever that comes into the life-sphere of man. This is precisely that
   which distinguishes rational creatures from the irrational, namely,
   that the latter have always simply a quite definite and restricted
   scope for their life-manifestation, while every thing else is
   indifferent to them, and as good as not existing, whereas rational
   creatures have an interest in all that exists, and bring it into some
   manner of relation to themselves. Perfect indifference to the world is
   Indian, but not Christian, wisdom; God is indifferent to nothing, and
   for this reason moral man, the image of God, is so also. The collective
   All and God himself constitute the life-sphere of the moral. Because of
   the inner unity of all things, every moral act not only reverberates in
   the whole universe, and there is joy among the angels in heaven over
   one sinner that repents, but this act itself acts upon the All, for all
   that is good and all that is capable of good belong together in one
   great unity. The declaration: "Whether life, or death, or things
   present or things to come--all are yours" [1 Cor. iii, 22], holds good
   in its fullest sense of the moral life, although indeed our moral
   bearing toward the different forms of existence is correspondingly
   different; to nature the moral spirit is related as dominating, to God
   as obeying.

   The conceiving of God himself as an object of the moral activity is a
   fundamental point in Christian ethics. It is true the heathen also
   required reverence toward the gods, but this exercise of piety did not
   rise to a dominating power over the entire moral life. In recent times
   it has become a favorite view to regard the moral as not relating to
   God at all, but only to man, or indeed also to nature; it is even said
   that God cannot be an object of the moral activity, seeing that because
   of his unapproachable sublimity he must be inaccessible to all human
   influence. Evidently, with this view of the matter, prayer is narrowed
   down to a mere pious exercise without any other possible efficacy than
   to benefit the person so exercising; it would be more consequential,
   however, for those who think thus to follow Kant, and discard prayer
   altogether as empty and meaningless. It does not come within our scope
   to answer here the question, how the answering of prayer is
   reconcilable with the eternally-immutable nature of God, but we simply
   accept from dogmatics the unquestionably Scriptural principle, that God
   actually does hear and answer prayer, that prayer and its answering are
   not a delusion, but that proper prayer really and truly conditions the
   answering of the petitions, and that consequently it has a positive
   influence on the bearing of God toward man. True prayer is impossible
   so soon as I entertain the opinion that it has no effect, that the
   gracious turning of God toward me is not in some way conditioned
   thereby. This does not imply that God comes into any manner of
   dependence on man; whatever he does is eternally self-determined, but
   it is determined in view of the moral bearing of man as divinely gifted
   with rational freedom. In this sense, prayer is really a moral activity
   in relation to God, and God is a real object of the same. Prayer is the
   beginning and the end of all moral activity. The sentiment: "Pray and
   work," holds good of all and every moral life; the two do not stand
   beside each other, but consist only in and with each other.

   God, as living and personal, cannot sustain a relation of indifference
   to human conduct. If we can speak in any proper sense of a displeasure
   of God at sin, of a wrath of God against sin, then must also,
   conversely, the pleasure of God in the moral conduct of man be of a
   real character, and hence, in some manner, conditioned by said conduct.
   The moral activity as relating to God is per se necessarily pious; but
   to presume, for this reason, to exclude it from the sphere of the
   moral, would be very inconsistent; for in fact it takes place with
   freedom, and with moral consciousness and with moral purpose, and it is
   frequently, in the Scriptures, expressly required as a duty; and all
   duties are moral. But, on the other hand, all duties are also pious,
   inasmuch as morality is always in very close association with piety (§
   55), and no duty can in fact be truly fulfilled without being regarded
   as an expression of the divine will, and hence without pious submission
   to that will. We therefore must reject the view that there are no moral
   duties toward God, and no moral influencing of God; if there are sins
   against God, as, for example, blasphemy, then there must also be duties
   toward Him,--and we must, further, reject the view that the duties
   toward God constitute a special group entirely distinct from the
   others, so that in fact the duties toward man might be fulfilled
   without at the same time also fulfilling those toward God.

   The distribution of the subject-matter of ethics into duties toward
   God, duties toward one's self and duties toward other men, was formerly
   very usual; it was, however, only partially correct. God fills, in
   fact, heaven and earth, and the statement of Christ that whatever "ye
   have done unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
   unto me" [Matt. xxv, 40], is of course true also in relation to God. It
   might, however, be said that, while it is true that all other duties
   imply in themselves also a fulfillment of duty toward God, yet that the
   converse is not true, so that consequently the duties of piety might be
   considered by themselves, seeing that in fact in the duty of worshiping
   God no other duty is directly implied. This is, however, only seemingly
   so; for in every duty toward God, I fulfill also directly at the same
   time a duty toward myself: I cannot possibly love and honor God without
   exalting myself into communion with Him; whatever man does to the honor
   of God is at the same time a self-transfiguration; he cannot praise God
   as his Father without confirming himself as the child of God. Moreover
   he can do this only in so far as he, at the same time, divests himself
   of illegitimate self-love; and only that one can be in communion with
   God, who likewise enters into communion with the God-fearing. The
   fulfilling of our moral duties toward God implies consequently in
   itself, really and directly at the same time also, the fulfilling of
   our duties toward those who are beloved of God. Hence, the moral
   relation to God is the central spring of all other moral life, and our
   duties toward God do not stand co-ordinate with and apart from our
   other duties.

  SECTION LXXXVII.

   II. The moral activity as strengthened by its moral relation to God,
   that is, by communion with Him, comes now, and only in consequence of
   this strengthening, into a truly moral relation to the
   created,--comprehending both the moral person himself and also the, to
   him, objective world.

   (1) The moral person is his own object. Man is morally to form, to
   cultivate himself--to make his personal peculiar reality a product of
   his moral activity. Man is what he is as a person solely in virtue of
   moral activity; without this activity he remains in spiritual
   unculture, and is essentially impersonal. Hence man is, in so far, an
   object of his own moral activity, as he has not yet attained to his
   ultimate perfection,--in so far as he is a cultivable and, as yet,
   relatively incompleted being, that is, in so far as there is yet a
   difference between his ideal and his reality. Man is to form himself
   into a good entity, that is, into a personal reality that is in full
   harmony with God, with itself and with the All, in so far as this is
   good.

   The possibility of man's bearing a moral relation to himself rests on
   the nature of rational self-consciousness, wherein man becomes in fact
   an object to himself. If man were from the very start absolutely
   perfect and complete, he would still be, even then, an object of his
   own moral activity, only however under its conserving, but not under
   its formative, phase. Progressive development is implied in the very
   nature of the created spirit, and there is no stage of temporal life
   conceivable where man would not have a still higher perfection to
   attain to, and further moral culture to work out.--All self-forming,
   unless kept in harmony with God, becomes necessarily anti-moral. Man
   can, it is true, develop himself in harmony with himself without being
   in harmony with God, --this is, however, a culture of self into the
   diabolical; and if he forms himself merely in harmony with the world,
   he becomes an immoral worldling, and if in this worldliness he leaves
   self-harmony out of the question, then he becomes simply characterless.

   (a) The spirit is an object of the moral activity in virtue of its
   being per se merely the possibility of its real development into a
   rational spirit,--the germ of itself,--and because it does not develop
   itself into its full reality by inner nature-necessity, but by freedom.
   Man has, in virtue of his very constitution, the task of forming
   himself into the full reality and truth of spiritual being, namely, in
   respect both to his knowing, to his feeling, and to his willing,--that
   is, into the perfect image of God. The soul-life of brutes shapes
   itself by inner nature-necessity; brutes have no need of education;
   man, however, without education and without moral self-culture would
   sink below the brute, and for the evident reason that he would thus
   fall into complete self-antagonism; his freedom would become unbridled
   barbarity. Spirit lives only by continuous development; where it is not
   morally trained, it pines away and degenerates. What Christ says of the
   received talents [Matt. xxv, 14 sqq.] is especially true also of the
   moral culture of the spirit.

   (b) The body is an object of the moral activity in so far as it is the
   necessary organ of the spirit in its relation to the world. It is not
   from the very start an absolutely subserving and perfectly
   spirit-imbued organ (§ 65, 66), nor does it become such by purely
   natural development, but it is trained into such only by the rightful
   dominating of the rational spirit over it. The merely natural
   development of the spirit forms not as yet a spirit's-body, but only an
   unspiritual animal body. Even as in the features of the countenance,
   spiritual unculture and spiritual refinement are almost always visibly
   expressed, so is also the body in its entire being subject to the
   refining influence of the moral spirit; and this influence ought not to
   be of a merely mediate and unintended character, as resulting from the
   unconsciously-ruling potency of the spiritual life in the body, but in
   fact also of an immediate character. The good that inheres in the body
   is to be faithfully preserved,--the germs of higher perfection to be
   developed. Whatever is originally given in the body, whether as
   actuality or as capacity, is a legitimate possession of the spirit and
   should not be lightly esteemed. To despise the body is to dishonor the
   Creator. It should not be honored, however, as merely corporeal, but as
   subserving the spirit in its rational life-work,--not as an end in
   itself, but as an end for the spirit. "Glorify God in your body;" this
   moral precept, the apostle bases on the fact that this body is "a
   temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye
   are not your own" [1 Cor. vi, 19, 20]. The body is not a mere
   nature-object, but a holy temple of a sanctified spirit,--bears the
   consecration of a sacred destination; man has not discretionary power
   over it, as over a mere nature-object,--not merely as over an
   unconditional possession, but as over a good intrusted to him by God,
   and belonging to God, and for which he must give account to God.

  SECTION LXXXVIII.

   (2) The external world as an object of the moral activity,--the widest
   and almost endlessly diversified field of this activity,--is--(a) the
   world of rational beings,--primarily and chiefly the world of humanity.
   To the moral person other persons stand, on the one hand, in the
   relation of similarity, in virtue of the common possession of a
   rational nature, and, on the other, in the relation of difference, in
   so far as each individual is an independent moral person with a special
   peculiarity; and it is the part of the moral activity at once to
   respect, to acknowledge, to preserve, and to promote both these
   features, and to bring them into reciprocal harmony. A human being
   never becomes, for the person acting upon it, a merely dependent
   rightless object, but in all cases continues to be a personality that
   is to be respected in its legitimate peculiarity, and hence it should
   never become an unfree and as it were impersonal creation of another,
   but it is an object for the moral activity only so far as it is itself
   at the same time recognized and treated as a moral subject. The moral
   bearing of man to his fellows rests essentially on the thought of the
   inner, and not merely conceived, but also real, unity of the human
   race, which finds its whole truth only in the thought of the common
   origin of all men from a first-created primitive individual.

   Here also Christian morality comes into striking antagonism to all
   non-Christian morality. The thought of mankind as a homogeneous whole
   of which each individual is a legitimate rightful member, is peculiar
   to Christianity; the heathen know only nations and compatriots but not
   humanity and man; even the free Greek and the Roman make the
   distinction both in fact and in law between persons and slaves; the
   slave is only a thing, not a moral personality. All acting upon others
   which aims simply to exert an influence upon them without also
   receiving an influence from them, is immoral. Even the immature child
   necessarily exerts some influence upon its educator; and when Christ
   presented a child to his disciples as a moral pattern [Matt. xviii, 3,
   4], this is not to be regarded as holding good simply in a loose sense
   and for the morally immature, on the contrary it is the moral essence
   of the child, its God-likeness, that is, in fact, a true mirror of the
   moral even for the relatively mature educator, and that has a right to
   his respect. That person is a pernicious educator who has never
   experienced a real moral influence upon himself from the child,--who
   has never recognized in the soul of the child the features of the image
   of God, nor been impressed with respect for child-naïveté; and it is
   the acme of meanness not to respect and sacredly to protect
   child-innocence.

   The moral conceiving of man as an object of the moral activity,
   presupposes that we have in fact to do with real true men, men who are
   not only similar to us, but who are bound to us as members of one body.
   To creatures which, while belonging to the zoological order bimana, and
   while differing from the ape by the formation of the skull and of the
   feet and by an erect walk, yet should have been from of old
   distinguished, both in their origin and also in their
   spiritually-inferior nature, from the so-called "nobler" race of the
   whites, we could not come into the same moral relation as to those who
   are our brethren. The question as to the origin of the different races
   of men has a deep moral significancy, and is of fundamental importance
   for ethics. The natural science of the present day, which has become
   largely infected with a spirit-denying materialism, is well known to
   have until quite recently declared it as a fully-established fact that
   the various physically-differing races of men are of different origin,
   and cannot have descended from a single primitive race; and there are
   not a few persons, in other respects favorable to the Christian faith,
   who recognize these pretended "results of modern science" as really
   such, and regard them as beyond question. It is not here the place to
   examine the scientific worth of these so-esteemed results; we have to
   do with the question here only in its moral significancy. We merely
   remark in passing, that we must absolutely deny to an experimental
   science--and this is the pretended source of said results--the right to
   decide upon matters that lie beyond all experience. Such science can
   simply affirm what is, or is not, but it cannot decide what cannot
   possibly be. "Empirical" natural science may be justifiable in saying,
   that so far as experience goes, a white person is never born of a
   negro, nor a negro of a white person, though even this is not
   uncontested, but it has no scientific ground for inferring, that,
   consequently, it can also never have been otherwise. Inferences of this
   kind, illegitimate even according to the simplest rules of logic, are
   overturned almost daily by the mere progress of science. Moreover, it
   is not unworthy of remark that the position: "as it is in the life of
   nature now, so must it always have been" is applied to the question
   before us by the very same persons who cannot admit that the human race
   could have otherwise originated than through some extraordinarily
   potent nature-process--through human germs, forsooth, that were cast
   from the sea upon the shore,--and who in reply to the question: why
   then this interesting nature-process has not repeated itself also in
   our own day, or at least during the historical period in general?
   immediately exclaim, that nature has declined in her generative power.
   On the whole, therefore, and in view of the fact that the latest
   "progress" of this particular wing of natural science takes ground in
   direct antagonism to the above pretended unassailable "results,"
   namely, in regarding man as an advanced development of the ape
   (Darwin), we may without the least anxiety spare ourselves the trouble
   of refuting the above-mentioned earlier view, and abandon this "modern"
   science to its own further self-dissolution.

   Christianity has from the beginning had a clear consciousness of the
   moral significancy of the original unity of the human race. Though God
   had undoubtedly the power to create thousands of men in the different
   parts of the earth, instead of one, as he did in fact do in the case of
   plants and animals, nevertheless it must be for good reasons that in
   the Scriptures the whole human race is assumed to have sprung from a
   single stock [Gen. i, 27, 28; ii, 18; iii, 20]. There is involved here
   an antagonism of the natural and the spiritual stand-points, and that
   too in a moral respect. According to naturalism the unity of the world
   is a merely conceived something,--in reality it is a product of a
   presupposed multiplicity of single existences; and also the good, which
   in its nature is a manifestation-form of unity, is not an element
   fundamental and presupposed in every single existence, but it is simply
   a consequence--a product of the active individual; the good is ever to
   be without ever and truly being. According to the Christian system,
   however, the real unity and the real good are every-where the first,
   the fundamental, while multiplicity is only of a derived character.
   Here the moral is simply and solely the following of God as the
   absolutely good One, a free manifestation of a unity with God which in
   fact, however, originally existed,--which had not first to be realized,
   but only revealed, witnessed, and freely virtualized. Man is able to be
   moral only because, in his nature, he is already at one with God. So is
   it also in his moral relation to mankind; the unity of the total sum of
   individual men is not first to be created out of an original
   multiplicity, and to be constituted as an entirely new something, but
   it is simply (and this is the origin and the reason of this plurality)
   to be freely and morally witnessed and confirmed. Humanity is to become
   morally one, for the reason that in their origin they are already one;
   love to mankind is simply fidelity to the nature of man as existing
   from the beginning. This view is in diametrical antagonism to
   naturalistic ethics; and hence Paul presented it very prominently, at
   Athens, as the peculiarly-Christian view in contrast to heathenism
   [Acts xvii, 26; comp. Rom. v, 12, sqq.]; the latter estranges humanity
   into an original diversity; the former attributes all hostile
   antagonisms to the workings of sin.

   The very natural and in fact morally legitimate feeling, that
   blood-relatives stand to us in a closer relation of duty than entire
   strangers, contains a profound truth. It calls forth really a very
   different and morally more potent feeling, when we know that even the
   degenerated negro is of our own blood, our brother, sprang from one
   father, than if we should assume that he is originally, and by nature,
   of a spiritually and corporeally inferior species [August., De Civ.
   Dei., xii, 21]. That which forms no unessential part of the
   world-historical honor of Christianity, namely, that it has made
   slavery morally impossible, has been again absolutely put into question
   by the teachings of naturalism; and it is scientifically as well as
   morally a signal indication of inconsideration, and especially so on
   the part of theologians, to declare the decision of the question as to
   the original unity of the human race as a mere non-essential matter. By
   the assumption that there were originally different races, the
   slavery-system is not only excused, but it is directly justified. In
   fact man has not only not the duty, but he has not the right to break
   down the original and naturally-constituted differences of spiritual
   existence. But the moral influencing of the degenerate races consists
   essentially in raising the actually lower-standing individuals of the
   colored races to the height of the whites,--in placing them both, in
   spiritually-moral respects, on an equal footing, in making of the
   colored races our true and proper brothers, in doing away, in fact,
   with whatever places them actually below the whites. But the effort to
   do this would be, in the eyes of the above-mentioned teaching, a simple
   presumption, a transgression of the limits prescribed to us by nature
   herself; according to it, the negro is destined by his primitive and
   manifestly inferior peculiarity, to service under the higher race, and
   it would be a criminal interference with the ordinances of nature to
   wish to change this. That which has hitherto passed for the greatest
   stain upon a perverted Christian civilization, the re-establishment of
   slavery, can find no more desirable an apology than these results of a
   perverted science; and it is a standing and entirely consequential
   opinion among even the most liberal-thinking champions of this
   tendency, that negroes are in fact but half-men and should remain such.

  SECTION LXXXIX.

   (b) External nature as an object of the moral activity is such not
   merely in its single manifestations, but also in its totality. On the
   one hand, nature exists not for itself but for the rational spirit for
   man; on the other, it is, as a work of divine creation, a good thing,
   and hence has rights in and of itself:--(1) Nature is by origin and
   essence destined to be dominated by the rational spirit as God's
   image,--to be formed by the spirit into its organ and for its service.
   As nature is not per se moral, hence man's moral relation to it does
   not consist in his receiving from it a direct moral influence, though
   indeed he does receive from it a mediate moral influence through the
   contemplation of the image of God as manifesting itself therein, but in
   his acting morally upon it. For the single individual, this action is
   always limited to a narrow theater, but for humanity it extends to all
   terrestrial nature. As the body is related to the individual spirit, so
   is nature related to humanity in general; nature's destination is to be
   perfectly subservient to man and to be exalted in the service of his
   rational destination.--(2) But this dominating of nature is essentially
   conditioned on the truly moral and hence rational self-culture of man,
   in virtue of which nature is not to be subjected to the whims of
   irrational caprice; for, as God's work, nature has claims upon man; it
   is legitimately an object for human activity only in so far as main
   subordinates himself to the divine will, whose peculiarity it is not to
   destroy but to preserve.

   The relation of nature to the rational spirit is neither that of an
   object absolutely different from and foreign to it, seeing that both
   are the work of one creative spirit, nor that of a power entitled to
   dominate over the same; this would be a reversing of the moral order of
   the world; for that which is per se higher and rational should not be
   enslaved under that which is inferior and irrational. If, therefore,
   nature and spirit exist for each other, and if they are to constitute
   an intimate unity, then the only relation possible is, that the spirit
   shall be the dominating power over nature,--the power that forms and
   molds it. And if in reality the relation is in many respects now
   actually otherwise, still this should not lead us astray in conceiving
   of the true relation between them in a sinless state. The rational
   consciousness of all nations has at least some presentiment of the
   proper relation. Even as in all forms of superstition a more or less
   clear expression is given to a presentiment, though indeed misapplied,
   of a corresponding deeper truth that lies beyond the grasp of the
   superficial understanding, so also has the notion of magic, so widely
   prevalent throughout heathendom, its roots in a presentiment of the
   true relation of reason to nature. [11] It is but the childishly
   perverted thought, that the spirit should not be enslaved under
   unspiritual nature,--that its true destination is to cause nature to
   subserve it in its own purposes. When Christ, in his character of Son
   of man, exerts his mastery over nature, and by his miraculous deeds
   counterworks the sufferings that have sprung from the enslavement of
   sinful humanity under nature, and when he promises like power also to
   his disciples on condition of faith [Matt. xvii, 20; Mark xvi, 17, 18;
   Luke x, 19; xvii, 6; John xiv, 12], he simply indicates, though
   primarily only in a typical manner, the true goal of human development
   in its relation to nature. The miracle does not play feats with nature,
   it simply dominates it,--subjects it not to the irrational caprice of
   the individual will, but to the rational will of man as in union with
   God; and it is a rational demand of the rational will, to be free from
   all fetters that lie outside of the rational will,--to be. untrammeled
   in its activities by sufferings that spring from bondage to
   spirit-hostile nature.

   Nevertheless nature is not to be considered as mere material for the
   active spirit, and absolutely without rights of its own; it has a right
   to be respected, because of the rationality that is impressed upon it.
   From the face of nature the Spirit of the Creator beams forth upon us
   with striking evidence; here also there is holy ground which man should
   not tread with unwashed feet. That is not a moral bearing toward nature
   which forgets the image of God that is stamped upon it, and which, in
   the zeal of shaping and enjoying it, perceives not that also natural
   objects, even while as yet untouched by the plastic hand of man,
   proclaim the glory of God. The Hindoo's dread-reverencing of natural
   objects, though indeed oblivious of the Creator, has yet a positive
   presentiment of the divine in the works of the, to him, unknown God.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE MORAL MOTIVE.

  SECTION XC.

   EVERY motive to action is primarily a feeling; but feeling springs from
   a consciousness. And feeling is such motive under both of its forms of
   manifestation, as feeling of satisfaction or of dissatisfaction, and
   hence of pleasure or of displeasure. The feeling of displeasure is to
   be assumed as existing to a certain degree also in a state of strictly
   normal life-development, namely, in so far as man, before reaching his
   last stage of perfection, has always a consciousness, that as yet
   something is lacking to him to which he is yet to attain. This is not
   pain, but yet it is a feeling of want.

   Any view is contrary to the nature of the soul-life which assumes any
   other soul activity, as, for example, cognition, as the most immediate
   motive of the moral. Thought per se contains nothing that moves the
   will; but thought is in fact never absolutely alone, is never a merely
   inert possession, but it excites at once and necessarily a feeling, and
   then, through this feeling, the will. I feel myself in some way
   affected by the perceived or conceived, more or less agreeably or
   disagreeably, according as it is in harmony with, or in contradiction
   to, my present state. An entire indifference is here impossible, though
   indeed the shades of the feeling of pleasure or displeasure may be very
   different,--impossible for the reason that that which I receive into
   myself sensuously or spiritually, must necessarily come into some sort
   of relation to my present corporeal or spiritual reality, and for the
   reason that this relation must always be either one of harmony or
   disharmony. It is true indeed that the different phases of a received
   impression may have different bearings, and hence the feeling that
   arises from them may be of a complex character; nevertheless in this
   complexity the elements of the pleasant and the unpleasant remain
   always distinct,--do not coalesce together into a feeling of total
   indifference, just as every object that is taken for nutriment is
   either strengthening or weakening to the body, but cannot be absolutely
   indifferent. Now, every feeling stirs up also straightway the will, and
   hence activity in general; in case it is a pleasant feeling we desire
   to possess its object, either by preserving it or by appropriating it;
   in case the feeling is unpleasant we seek to get rid of it. In this
   double-movement all action is embraced, and hence also all that is
   moral; and this movement itself rests absolutely on an antecedent
   feeling. Thought, it is true, is the foundation of the moral, but it is
   only the feeling excited thereby that is the motive proper of action.
   Only he can will the good who has pleasure in the law of the Lord [Rom.
   vii, 22; Psa. i, 2; cxii, 1].--When the thought of something not yet
   existing, but which may be realized by my action, awakens in me a
   feeling of pleasure, this is in fact the thought of a good, which, by
   virtue of this feeling, becomes an intention, which differs from a
   resolution in the fact that the latter relates not to the good itself
   but to the means of realizing it. While, however, an intention refers
   to a good, a purpose refers to the good. I purpose to become a perfect
   man; I have an intention of mastering a science; I form a resolution or
   determination to study. But a thought becomes to me a purpose only by
   the accession thereto of the feeling of love; in a resolution the will
   stands forth a little more actively.

   It might, now, seem that while in the condition of the primitive
   sinless goodness of human nature, there would be place for feelings of
   pleasure, that is, of happiness, yet there would not be occasion for
   the feeling of displeasure. This would be only then correct when man's
   original perfection should be conceived of, contrary to the very idea
   of life in general, as a state of completion. But all capability of
   development implies a certain lack, though not a fault, nor a non-good;
   and every consciousness of a lack awakens the feeling of a want, which,
   though it is not a pain, and does not destroy inward happiness, is yet
   also not the pleasurable feeling of complete satisfaction. That even he
   who is perfectly constituted, and who remains in this perfection,
   should still have bodily and spiritual wants, which are per se
   necessarily attended with a certain, though indeed only momentary,
   feeling of displeasure, is implied in the very nature of the creature
   and of its development.

  SECTION XCI.

   Feeling as relating to the object that excites it, is, as a feeling of
   pleasure, love, and, as a feeling of displeasure, hatred. Between these
   two there is no third, although both may exist in different degrees and
   even in association with each other. Hence love is the feeling of
   pleasure which springs from the consciousness of the harmony of a real
   or conceived object with the actual state of the subject, together with
   a desire to preserve and to perfect this harmony, and hence also to
   preserve the being and essence of this object. Hatred is the feeling of
   displeasure which springs from the consciousness of an irreconcilable
   antagonism between the object and the subject, together with a desire
   to destroy this antagonism in the object, even should this involve the
   destruction itself of that object. In a normal moral condition of
   things where all that exists is good, love alone has a real object,
   while hatred has only a possible one.--Love is essentially of a
   preserving character, hatred is essentially of a negating, destroying
   character; as, however, all moral action aims to create a reality by
   continuous development, hence preserving love is necessarily at the
   same time also promotive of the being and nature of the beloved object,
   and negating hatred is at the same time a confirming of the opposite of
   the bated object. Hence love works in order to be able to love always;
   hatred works ill order to destroy itself; love lives in order to be
   eternal; hatred lives in order to come to an end; only that hatred can
   be endless whose object is eternal--namely, Satanic hatred. As moral
   hatred is necessarily an effort to destroy the antagonism of existence,
   that is, to re-establish its harmony, hence it is in essence the same
   thing as love. Hatred is per se as moral as love,--is but its necessary
   reverse phase. There is no moral love without hatred, and no moral
   hatred without love; pure hatred without love would be simply Satanic
   hatred. As moral hatred is in its essence love, hence the actual motive
   of all moral activity is love.

   "Love is the fulfilling of the law" [pleroma, Rom. xiii, 10]; in this
   formula the Christian idea of the moral motive is very definitely
   expressed; love leads to the fulfillment of the law; it is the rich
   fullness in which all law is included. Without love there is no
   morality; and where love is, there morality is truly free, for love
   develops itself into all forms of the moral. Hence Christ, after the
   example of the Old Testament [Deut. vi, 5; x, 12; xi, 13], sums up the
   whole law in the one precept of love to God and to our neighbor [Matt.
   xxii, 37; Luke x, 27]; "This is the love of God, that we keep his
   commandments" [1 John v, 3]; love is not and cannot be a mere inert
   feeling, but it is by its very nature active, it produces that which
   its subject loves,--brings about the full and free harmony of the
   person and his life with God. Whoever assigns any other motive for
   morality than love, knows nothing of the moral. But love tends by its
   essential nature to a unity of the diverse,--seeks not its own mere
   isolated being. Mere self-love to the exclusion of love to others is
   not love at all, but only immoral self-seeking; it is indeed a motive
   to action, but to anti-moral action; Even that which appears in the
   animal world as an unconscious symbol of moral virtue, is based on
   love, and is an expression thereof. There is no form of moral activity
   conceivable which would not be an expression of love [1 Cor. xvi,
   14].--The moral love of the divine is, per se and necessarily, also
   hatred against that which is ungodly. But as the ungodly is primarily
   not real but only conceivable, and as this thought itself becomes
   really vital only through the reality of sin, it does not come here
   properly within our scope.

   Love is taken here primarily as not yet a virtue or a disposition, but
   as a simple feeling occasioned by a consciousness of harmony or of
   disharmony. The love that is required as the fulfilling of the law is
   more than mere feeling, though indeed it has feeling as its basis and
   essence. And yet the love here in question is not a mere feeling of
   pleasure, not a mere impressed state of the heart, but it contains in
   itself at the same time a power prompting to an active relation to the
   beloved object. All love has for its object a something that is good,
   and hence, as relating to the subject, a good (§ 51), and it evidences
   the existence of this good by the outgoing and recognizing
   life-movement of the subject toward it,--by the effort of the subject
   toward the object in order to preserve or intensify its unity, its
   harmony therewith. Now as all existences are created for each other and
   destined to a self-harmonious life, hence love is the primitive feeling
   of all rational creatures,--the direct witness of the goodness of
   existence, an echo of that first witness of the Creator as to his
   created work, and hence also the innermost vitality of the moral life,
   the purpose and essence of which is in fact, harmony, or the good.
   Directed toward the good, and hence the divine, love has for itself the
   pledge of eternity; whereas moral hatred, as directed against all
   non-good, that is, anti-divine, has, in virtue of its negating nature,
   for its purpose, the destroying of its object and of itself with it.
   Peace is the goal of love and also of hatred,--is an essential phase of
   the highest good itself.

  SECTION XCII.

   If love is the motive to all moral action, and consequently also the
   necessary presupposition thereof; hence there must also be an
   ante-moral love, one that is per se not yet moral but which simply
   leads to the moral. In man's originally-possessed, though not as yet
   developed, God-likeness, there is in fact implied an original love
   antecedent to all moral volition,--an immediate love of the created
   spirit for the Creator as revealing himself to it, and for the
   surrounding universe as proclaiming the Creator's love. This direct and
   not morally-acquired love is, however, not an unfreely-operating,
   compelling instinctive impulse, but receives the character of moral
   freedom through the simultaneously awakening consciousness of personal
   independence and of the therein-contained love of the person to
   himself, so that in virtue of this twofold primitive love, which offers
   the possibility of an antagonism as well as of a harmony, man is
   invited to a free self-determination.

   If the feeling of love is a directly excited one, and, as such, the
   presupposition of the moral activity to which it leads, it would seem
   as if moral freedom were actually precluded. For this feeling is as yet
   involuntary and unfree; and love and hatred produce, directly, a desire
   or a rejection. On the other hand, we cannot possibly exclude love from
   the sphere of the moral, and make of it a mere antecedent condition of
   the same; for according to the Christian consciousness at least, man is
   morally responsible for his love and his hatred; love is an object of
   duty, and is required by Christ as the essence of all fulfillment of
   the law. This seems like an irreconcilable contradiction.

   In the first place, it is unavoidably necessary to admit that there is
   an ante-moral love. Brutes even have love, and are thereby impelled to
   activity; also the child at its mother's breast feels and manifests
   love. This is not a love springing from free conscious volition,--not a
   moral love,--but a purely natural love, which forms, however, the
   necessary antecedent condition of all development to morality.
   Primitive man must also have had such a love, inasmuch as without this
   a life of God's image is not conceivable. Created in harmony with God
   and with the All, he must have had also a direct feeling of this
   harmony, must have felt happy in his existence and in his
   Paradise-world; and in this feeling of happiness he must also have
   loved that whereby it was produced in him; there met him on every hand
   the image of divine love, of the harmony of the universe, and he must
   have felt and loved it; and when God revealed himself to him as the
   loving Father, then must man have experienced also toward Him a feeling
   of harmony and love. But all this love is as yet simply a
   directly-excited one,--is not freely produced by moral activity, and is
   consequently not yet a moral love, though it indeed conducts to moral
   activity and thereby to a transformation of itself into moral love. If
   now this first ante-moral love of man for God and his work were the
   sole love really existing in man, then evidently the action answering
   to it, and hence also to the will of God, would flow out of it so
   immediately and necessarily that the possibility of a contrary
   self-determination would be scarcely conceivable, so that though indeed
   moral freedom in general would not be thereby destroyed, yet liberty of
   choice would actually and essentially be precluded. Man would not stand
   in free self-determination between the choice of the good and the evil,
   but he would be overpoweringly driven by an inner potent impulse to a
   choice of the good. Now, though this would in fact render conceivable
   an absolutely sinless development, still it would render all the more
   inconceivable the possibility of a determination to the sinful.

   But the matter assumes a very different aspect when we take into
   account the equally natural and immediate ante-moral impulse of
   self-love. This must, in fact, also be regarded as ante-moral, for the
   reason that it is the involuntary natural expression of soul-life in
   general, and hence exists also unconsciously among brutes. The fact
   that with man it is conscious, and constitutes a phase of rational
   self-consciousness, does not make it per se moral, but simply renders
   it capable of being formed into a moral quality. While now in the case
   of the brute the unconscious self-love can never become really evil,
   the self-love of man is, by virtue of the higher independence of the
   free spirit, only in a possible harmony with the love to God and the
   universe, but should come into real harmony therewith. Self-love is per
   se good,--is by no means the same as self-seeking or selfishness;
   Christ himself represents self-love as morally right, and as the
   measure for our love to our neighbor [Matt. xxii, 39; Luke x, 27; comp.
   Rom. xiii, 9; Gal. v, 14; James ii, 8; Eph. v, 28, 29, 33; 1 Sam.
   xviii, 1, 3]; but the goodness of this love consists not in an
   antecedently-established harmony with the love to God and the world,
   but simply in its liberty to confirm this harmony spontaneously. The
   love of God and the love of self are both equally primitive, and are
   per se not in antagonism with each other in the least, but yet they are
   different from each other and relatively independent of each other. In
   this mutual independence of these two forms of love there is afforded
   opportunity for the freedom of human choice. Man is called freely to
   confirm the harmony of his self-love and his divine love, and that too
   not by suppressing the one or the other, nor by making his love of God
   dependent on his self-love, but in fact by making his self-love
   dependent on his love of God,--by freely subordinating it thereto. As
   soon as the divine command was given to him, man was at once conscious
   that there was a difference between his self-love and his love to God,
   but also, at the same time, that it was his duty to develop this
   difference, not into antagonism but into harmony. The one (logically)
   possible mis-choice, of suppressing the per se legitimate self-love by
   disproportionate exaltation of the love to God, was impossible in fact,
   inasmuch as the love to God necessarily involves in itself all possible
   good, and hence also the proper love of self, for God preserves that
   which He himself has willed; so that consequently there remained
   possible only the other mis-choice (which was therefore morally
   forbidden), namely, of subordinating the love of God to self-love,
   instead of preserving the latter in its true character through its
   proper subordination to the former. If simply the love of God had been
   primitive in man, then a choice of the ungodly would have been
   impossible; if simply self-love had been primitive in him, then a
   choice of the good, of submission to the divine will, would have been
   equally impossible, and man would have been in the one case
   irresponsible for the good, and in the other for the evil--without
   desert and without guilt. But by virtue of the fact that the love to
   God and the love of self are alike primitive, as the ante-moral germ of
   the moral, it follows that man is fully responsible for the
   confirmation or the disturbance of the harmony of this twofold love;
   for this determination was not already involved in the constitution of
   man, but was proposed as a moral task to his free will. The mere love
   to God would have made man good but not free, the mere self-love would
   have made him seemingly free but not good; the twofold love made him
   free for choosing the good, but also free for the possible choice of
   the evil,--which, under these circumstances, assumed, in consequence of
   the equally real original love to God, the form of infidelity to God,
   of a punishable sin. The case is quite similar with the moral culture
   of the child. The child, as soon as self-conscious, has love for its
   mother, and also a per se strictly legitimate love for play; when the
   will of the mother calls the child from its play, it becomes conscious
   of the difference of the two forms of love; it knows also that it can
   prefer its love for play, and leave the will of the mother unheeded. It
   must by a morally-free choice, make a decision,--must subordinate the
   one love to the other; if it chooses obedience, then in thus choosing,
   and thus only, it feels itself truly free. If there had been no
   difference of a twofold love, the child would have had no choice; it
   would have just as unfreely, and without a consciousness of the good or
   a right to praise, followed its mother, as, on the other supposition,
   it would have unfreely and without a consciousness of the evil or a
   desert of blame, preferred its play. It is only such cases of choice,
   of moral self-determination, that bring the child's morality to
   development and to maturity.--It would be very erroneous to consider
   self-love as per se evil, and as a natural germ of the evil; the fact
   is, it simply offers-not per se, however, but in its normal difference
   from the love to God--the possibility of evil, but equally so also the
   possibility of moral good in general. It is only in the
   consciously-wrought free subordination of self-love to the divine love,
   that the latter as well as the former becomes moral. There can be no
   question of a "must" in the determination, whether in the one direction
   or in the other, but only of a "should" and a "should not."

  SECTION XCIII.

   The primitive love of man to God and his works becomes moral only,
   when, with consciousness and free recognition, it is confirmed by the
   self-loving spirit, and when the love to God is made to control the
   love of self, that is, when this twofold love becomes a striving of the
   self-love to put itself into harmony with all love, through free
   self-subordination to the love for God. Love as moral, and as
   consciously striving toward its object, becomes disposition. Hence for
   all further development of the moral life, a moral disposition is the
   necessary antecedent condition; and it is such in its twofold form, as
   the affirming disposition of love, and, with reference to evil, as the
   negating disposition of hatred. It is only as disposition, but not as
   ante-moral natural lobe, that love is an object of the divine law, a
   moral requirement, whereas the ante-moral love is simply an element of
   the good that is conferred in creation itself. Hence, as moral motive,
   love is also the basis of the moral in the fullest sense of the word,
   the life-inspiring germ of all other moral activity.

   By the fact that love becomes a moral duty, it does not cease to be a
   moral motive. Man, as, awakened to moral consciousness, is to have no
   other motive of his moral activity than one which he has himself
   morally constituted,--not a merely natural ante-moral love, but love as
   a disposition. Many are led to deny that love is at all an object of
   the divine law, from the simple fact that they reduce it to a mere
   involuntary feeling. Also Rothe affirms that we cannot command to love,
   but only to learn to love. This is very nearly a distinction without a
   difference; for if we can command to learn, and this learning has a
   necessary result, then evidently in commanding the learning we also
   command the result. The notion that man is per se, and irrespective of
   his moral depravity, not master of his own heart,--that he cannot
   dominate his proclivities. his love or his repugnance,--simply destroys
   his moral responsibility. If man cannot control his love and his
   hatred, and bring about in himself moral love, but must allow himself
   to be ruled by blind inclinations, then is he no longer a moral
   creature, but simply a dangerous sort of animal. If marriages are
   contracted only from "irresistible inclination" and dissolved because
   of "irresistible aversion," then they lie outside of the sphere of
   morality. Christian morality does not indeed require that marriages
   shall continue to exist despite the pretended "irresistible aversion;"
   on the contrary, it denies fundamentally that the notion of such an
   ungovernable aversion is to be admitted, inasmuch as it makes man
   morally responsible for his love and his hatred. It would not only be a
   monstrous but also an absurd theory of morals which should admit, on
   the one hand, that we are not at all master of our love and our
   aversion,--that love cannot be commanded as a duty,--and yet, on the
   other hand, should require that man should not act according to his
   love or aversion, but according to requirements of the moral law that
   have no connection therewith; he who has not love cannot practice love
   without hypocrisy; but that he has it not is his own fault. Christian
   ethics requires not to proclaim love in our deeds where there is no
   love, for it cannot require falseness; but it requires us to have love
   for all, and, for that reason also to practice it. The Scriptures
   declare unequivocally that love, the motive of all moral action, is
   also a duty commanded by the moral law; the law "Thou shalt love thy
   neighbor as thyself" [Lev. xix, 18; Matt, xxii, 39; Mark xii, 31] is
   called a "royal law," that is, a law that dominates all others [James
   ii, 8; comp. Gal. v, 14; Col, iii, 14; 1 Tim. i, 5; 1 John iii, 11
   sqq.; iv, 7 sqq.].

  SECTION XCIV.

   As morality is the free fulfilling of the divine will, hence moral love
   is primarily always love to God, and the love to created things is
   moral only in so far as it springs from the love to God,--considers
   created things as the work of God, and loves them in him. The
   God-consciousness, as developed into a moral love of God, is piety
   (eusebeia); hence all morality rests on piety. All non-pious love is
   immoral, and hence also all love to the creature as such, taken in
   itself without connection and interpenetration with the divine love.
   But all love to God rests on our consciousness of God's love to us;
   love is produced only by love; all moral love is, in its essence,
   reciprocal love; a non-loving creature can be loved only in so far as
   God's love is reflected to us from it; and for this very reason moral
   love to persons seeks indeed their love in return, but does not need
   it.

   As rational thought finds the unity of its thought-world only in the
   thought of God, so also moral love finds its rest and its unity only in
   love to God; it is not content with the semblance thereof but only with
   the truth; and all things have their truth only in their relation to
   God. As that love is higher, truer, and mightier which loves, in a
   person, not merely the earthly but also the soul, so is that love
   higher, truer, and mightier which loves in man, not merely the creature
   but also the image of God, and, through it, God himself. Love is the
   more genuine the higher its object; he who sees in creatures the trace
   of God, and loves God in them, he alone loves with the whole might of
   love. The proper love to the creature rests on the consciousness that
   "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof" [1 Cor. x, 26]; this
   does not lower the creature in the eyes of the love, but elevates both
   its worth and the love for it. Thus also Christ presents the precept of
   love to God as "the first and great commandment;" and "the second is
   like unto it," that is, it is already implied in it, though it does not
   absolutely coincide with it,--it is in fact the reflection of our love
   to God back upon our neighbor; our love for our neighbor is erroneous,
   when it does not rest upon love to God. Hence Christ says: "He that
   loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me" [Matt. x,
   37]. To the natural man this sounds hard and severe; but from a
   Christian stand-point, nay, even from a religious stand-point in
   general, no other view is possible than in fact, that a love for the
   creature without the higher divine love, or with one that prevails over
   the latter, is sinful. By this relation of all love to the love of God,
   this love is preserved also from one-sided narrowness,--clings not, in
   irrational caprice, to isolated objects,--but extends itself to all
   that is created, though indeed different degrees of such love are
   possible, from the fact of the differing peculiarity of the object and
   of the loving person.

   This true mutual relation of our love to the creature and our love to
   God, appears still more striking when we attentively consider the
   relation of human love to the divine love. As human thinking is only a
   reflection of the divine thought, so also is human love only a
   reflection of the divine love. All that is true and good in the copy is
   enkindled by the true and the good of the prototype; "He that loveth
   not knoweth not God, for God is love" [1 John iv, 8]. Man could not
   love God, and hence could not love morally at all, were he not loved of
   God. God's love is a love of grace; man's love is a love of
   gratitude,--the answering love of a child. Love cannot love any thing
   else but love [Psa. ciii, 1 sqq.; Col. iii, 17; 1 Thess. v, 18; 1 John
   iv, 11, 19]. For this reason there is no pain so great as where love
   remains unrequited. But to the pious heart it is not unrequited; such a
   heart finds the love which it seeks; Christ says: whatsoever "ye have
   done unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
   me;" and where, against the loving one, the heart of man coldly closes
   itself, there the love of God comes in its place.

  SECTION XCV.

   While our love to created things is either simply a love to the
   inferior, or to the equal, or to the merely relatively higher, and
   hence always meets its object with a consciousness of its own
   independent power and of an individual personal right, our love to God
   is, as directed to One that is absolutely superior to all that is
   human, always associated with a consciousness of our own impotency as
   in contrast to the infinite holy power of the Beloved, and hence is a
   love of fear. Love to God is essentially God-fearing; there is,
   however, no moral fear of God without also love to God. Mere fear alone
   is not a moral motive, for only love is this.

   In all love to a created object our moral action is complementive and
   promotive of the being and life of the same; we render to it in our
   love a real service, and obtain for ourselves a claim upon its
   grateful, answering love. But God's being and life cannot be
   complemented and heightened by our love; we cannot render to him a real
   service for which he would be under obligation to us [Job xli, 2; Rom.
   xi, 35]. Our love to God consists only with the consciousness that we
   receive every thing from God, and God nothing from us,--that our entire
   being and life stand absolutely in his power. Such a consciousness
   includes necessarily the feeling of fear--not fear of a mere power
   operating without reference to moral action, but of a righteous God who
   opposes all that is unholy; and in this sense Christ himself makes a
   regard for the penal judgments of God a motive for moral action [Matt.
   v, 22, 25 sqq.; xxv, 45, 46]. Fear of God in the absence of love is, in
   fact, by no means irrational; rather is it, wherever such love is
   lacking, the natural expression of the antagonism between the unholy
   nature of the person and the holy God, but such fear is not a moral
   motive. It presupposes the antagonism which the moral denies; and it
   cannot do away with it, for it is love alone that harmonizes. That
   nevertheless this slavish fear is of moral significancy for the state
   of sinfulness, we shall subsequently see. For the unfallen state, mere
   fear has neither reason nor possibility, for mere fear is, in its
   essence, hatred,--hatred against the more powerful being with whom we
   are not united by love.

   Mere love, however, without fear, as toward God, is not truthful, for
   that would be only a love of familiarity as with our equal. He who is
   conscious of his moral freedom, must also be conscious, as often as he
   makes use of this moral freedom, that God opposes his holy power to its
   misuse. The feeling which springs out of such a consciousness is not
   contrary to love, nor is it yet love itself, but it is genuine moral
   fear. Hence this moral awe of God, the true reverence for God, is the
   beginning of all wisdom and the condition of all morality [Deut. v, 29;
   vi, 2; x, 20; Prov. i, 7; viii, 13; ix, 10; xv, 33; xvi, 6; Psa. cxi,
   10; cxii, 7; Job xxviii, 28; 2 Cor. vii, 1]. Only those who fear the
   Lord trust in the Lord [Psa. cxv, 11]; for only the holy God gives
   surety for his love and truthfulness; not to fear God involves being
   godless [Prov. i, 29; Rom. iii, 18], and piety is synonymous with the
   fear of God (phobos Theou) [Acts ix, 13; Eph. v, 21; 2 Cor. vii, 1].
   The reference is not to this pious dread of the holy God, but to that
   mere servile fear which is at bottom hatred, when St. John says: "There
   is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear
   hath torment (kolasin echei, is a feeling of estrangement from God, of
   unblessedness); he that feareth is not made perfect in love" [1 John
   iv, 18]. The true fear of God is closely allied to the love of God
   [Deut. x, 12].

  SECTION XCVI.

   Where the love to God is true God-fearing, there it is also a firm
   trusting in God. Trusting is the reverse side of this fearing.
   Man-fearing is devoid of trust; God-fearing is per se also
   God-trusting. In relation to all that is evil, I fear God, who will
   bring it to naught and me with it; in relation to all that is good, I
   trust God, who will not permit me to come to naught, but will
   gloriously accomplish that which I begin in his name. God-fearing love
   is full of confidence in the results of its moral strivings; because it
   fears God, it has no reason to fear any power that is hostile to God.
   Certain of its victory, and certain that it works in God and for God,
   and hence that it accomplishes divine and imperishable work, it becomes
   enthusiasm, which is the highest and truest moral motive, and the only
   sufficient power where there is involved a moral working for general
   interests that transcend all temporal individual interests,--where the
   temporal happiness of the person must be sacrificed to a moral
   principle,--which, however, is conceivable only where sin is dominant.

   Trusting in God is faith, love, and hope at the same time; primarily,
   however, it is not a result of moral self-culture. but it is simply the
   germ of that threefold life that is antecedent to all actual moral
   life. As the awakening consciousness of the child expresses itself in
   an, as yet, obscure trust to its mother, so is it with man's first
   life-relation to God. Man attains a trust not simply through faith and
   through love, but faith and love are per se, and of necessity, trust
   already; and hence trust is a necessary antecedent condition of all
   moral life. Trust relates to the idea of an end; the mere desire of an
   end is not a sufficient motive to inspire moral effort toward it; it
   may be a hopeless, and hence an inactive, desire; doubting Peter sinks
   in the waves; it is only an unshaken trust that confirms courage and
   awakens strength [Psa. xviii, 31 sqq.; xxvii, 14; xxxiv, 9; xxxvii, 3
   sqq.; lxii, 6 sqq.; lxxxiv, 13; Prov. xvi, 20, and elsewhere].--There
   is no enthusiasm for evil,--at furthest only a Satanic pleasure in
   evil, but this pleasure is attended with fear and malice, but not
   enthusiasm. Man as sinful may err as to what is good or evil, and he
   may therefore have enthusiasm for a folly, but only from the fact that
   he takes it for something good and noble. Nor can the merely individual
   and temporal awaken enthusiasm; nothing but the ideal can do
   this,--that which is, or is conceived of as, absolutely valid, as
   eternal truth, and hence of divine significancy, in a word that in the
   victory and permanent endurance of which the person has entire
   confidence. For that which is merely individual or useful I may indeed
   have energy or passion, but not enthusiasm. Only the absolutely good,
   the divine, is free from all doubt. Doubt is death to enthusiasm;
   without faith it is not possible morally to battle for the divine.
   Without enthusiasm there can be but a cold, calculating working for
   temporal ends, but no effort for the divine and eternal; hence whatever
   is not of faith is sin, for it is non-moral, whereas man ought
   constantly to be moral. The apostles had indeed, during Christ's
   earthly life, a warm love for their Master, so that they were ready
   even to die with him [John xi, 16], but they had enthusiasm only after
   the pouring out of the Holy Ghost.

  SECTION XCVII.

   As love springs from the consciousness of the harmony of the person
   with his object, and as the feeling of such a harmony is the feeling of
   happiness, hence all love is per se also happiness, and its striving is
   necessarily a striving for happiness. As, however, love does not seek
   its own, but finds its bliss alone in that of the beloved, it is clear
   that this striving for happiness, as based on moral love, is in nowise
   self-seeking and narrow-hearted, but, on the contrary, a proper motive
   of moral activity,--only, however, in so far as it is in unison with
   the right love, and does not appear as something different from
   it,--not as the first and fundamental element, but only as a derived
   one; but it becomes an immoral motive in so far as it is an expression
   of mere self love (Eudemonism).--The tendency to the good, which is
   produced by moral activity, becomes in turn itself a higher motive to
   the moral.

   The question as to the morality of happiness-seeking as a moral motive,
   cannot be answered without a more definite characterization. The
   "eudemonistic" view proper, that of the Epicureans, is evidently
   immoral, as it rests on mere self-love. Heathen ethics could oppose to
   this self-seeking happiness-principle nothing other than the notion
   that virtue should be sought after for its own sake. If there was here
   a seeming subordinating of the person to a general moral idea, still,
   because of the inner untruthfulness of the position, it could not
   possibly be otherwise than that in fact, even in the strictest
   Stoicism, the mere proud self-consciousness of the individual should
   be, after all, the influencing motive proper. The thought of love as
   the true moral motive was entirely wanting to heathen ethics,--is
   peculiar to Christianity. The Christian idea of love harmonizes the
   legitimate self-love with submission to the moral law. In loving God,
   man loves also himself as a child of God, and in fulfilling his duty he
   at the same time realizes his happiness. The love to God and to His
   creatures is, on the one hand, a feeling of happiness, and, on the
   other, a motive to moral activity. The old controversy about the
   happiness-principle, which has in recent times been revived, especially
   by the school of Kant, receives its proper solution only in the
   Christian view, namely, in that, while Christianity recognizes in the
   proper seeking for happiness a strictly moral motive, it also exalts
   the character of this seeking by the love in which alone it bases it.
   It is therefore a very one-sided illiberality in Rationalists to
   reproach Old Testament ethics with "Eudemonism." It is true, the Old
   Testament recognizes the seeking after happiness as a proper motive in
   the fulfilling of the law: "That it may go well with thee and with thy
   children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the
   earth" [Deut. iv, 40; Exod. xx, 12; Deut. v, 16; xxix, 33; Psa. xxxvii,
   37; cxxii, 6, etc.]; the formula "Blessed is he that," etc., [Psa. i,
   1; ii, 12; xxxiv, 8; xl, 4, etc.] and other similar ones, are very
   frequently given as an encouragement to moral obedience; but also
   Christ himself and the apostles expressly present such a motive: "Do
   this and thou shalt live" [Luke x, 28; comp. Matt. xix, 16, 17, 28, 29;
   vi, 19, 20; Mark x, 21; Luke xii, 33; John iii, 36; Eph. vi, 3; Rom.
   ii, 7; 1 Tim. iv, 88; vi, 19]; the "crown" of life is promised as a
   reward to fidelity [1 Cor. ix, 25; 2 Tim. iv, 8; 1 Peter v, 4; James i,
   12; Rev. ii, 10]; but neither the Old nor the New Testament separate
   this striving for happiness from the love to God and our neighbor in
   which, in fact, both Covenants find the true motive to moral action.
   There is, in reality, no essential antagonism between love and the
   striving after happiness; but the latter is directly implied in the
   former, and is, in the nature of the case, inseparable from it.
   Christianity knows no other happiness than love to God in the
   consciousness of being loved by him.

   All moral activity has necessarily a permanent result in the person
   himself; it makes the moral his possession and property,--forms more
   and more his moral character, and hence creates a tendency to, and a
   readiness in, moral acting. I his moral possession, as a result of
   moral activity--virtue--becomes in turn itself, as an active power, a
   motive force to moral life, so that by his moral activity man
   constantly increases the actuating power of the same. Of this readiness
   or skill in moral acting we will have occasion to speak hereafter; we
   merely remark here, that by virtue of acting morally the originally as
   yet undetermined freedom of choice receives a determined
   character,--takes up into itself the morally good as such. The moral
   develops itself into a constantly increasing power,--renews itself on a
   progressively larger scale in the organic circulation of life. The good
   becomes to the moral man, as it were, a second nature, which, in turn,
   works out of itself by virtue of its own power; it is no longer simply
   something objective to him, nor merely a natural quality conferred upon
   him, but it is a vital possession, and hence an actuating power within
   him.

CHAPTER V.

  THE MORAL ACTIVITY.

  SECTION XCVIII.

   LOVE works the accomplishment of the lovingly-willed end; the moral
   motive and the accomplishing of the end belong, therefore, morally,
   inseparably together. The moral element lies neither exclusively in the
   motive, nor exclusively in the action; neither exclusively in the
   intention or end, nor exclusively in the means to the end, but in the
   unity of both. A good end does not sanctify the means, nor do good
   means sanctify the end, but a good end is accomplished morally only by
   good means; all end which actually can be realized by immoral means, is
   itself immoral.

   As the moral is a free realizing of a rational end, the question
   naturally rises, wherein the moral element properly lies, namely,
   whether in the end and in the motive? or in the means to the end, that
   is, in the acts that lead to the realization of the end? or whether in
   both at the same time,--that is, whether we are to judge of an act
   exclusively from the intention, or exclusively from the action itself,
   or in fact from both together? The first of these queries has been
   answered affirmatively by the Jesuits--though this is not peculiar to
   them, but is involved more or less in all perverted moralizing,
   especially in that of worldly society at large; outside of the sphere
   of Christian earnestness there prevails every-where in fact a tendency
   to distinguish between the morality of the end and that of the means.

   From the very idea of the moral it follows necessarily that the
   conscious end, and hence the intention, occupies with good right the
   chief place in determining the moral judgment, and that consequently
   only that action can be good which aims at a good end--one in harmony
   with the moral order of the world. Whatever accomplishes such an end
   must consequently be in harmony with the moral order of the world, and
   hence be itself good; when therefore the axiom: "The end sanctifies the
   means" is understood to mean "that the means which answer to a really
   good end are necessarily also good," then it is entirely
   unobjectionable; it becomes false only when either the end is only
   seemingly good, or the means only seemingly appropriate, or where it is
   assumed that the means, that is, the actions, are per se morally
   indifferent, and receive a moral character only from the intention. As,
   however, all free action falls within the sphere of the moral order of
   the world, and as the reality that is produced by this action is either
   in harmony or in disharmony with this order, hence also the action, per
   se and irrespectively of its end, is either good or bad,--though
   indeed, in order to its full moral appreciation, its end also must be
   taken into the account. He who sets a house on fire from negligence may
   have had no evil intention, but he is punished nevertheless, and justly
   so, for his action was per se evil, and might have been avoided by him.
   If we suppose instead of an absolutely good end, that is, such a one as
   is a part of the highest good, simply particular ends, the goodness of
   which consists only in their subordination to the order of the whole,
   then the axiom: "The end sanctifies the means," is false, in so far as
   the end or means do not consist with the order of the whole. He who
   burns down a house in order to drive the rats out of it attains indeed
   his end, but at the same time he destroys the super-ordinate end of the
   house. The question becomes difficult only when bearing upon moral
   action in a sinful world, in which evil, and hence the infliction of
   evils for punishment, for discipline and defense, has a legitimate
   place. But of this we can only speak further on.

   Moral action, as flowing from love, may be considered from two points
   of view: first, in itself, according to its inner differences, that is,
   moral action as such; secondly, in relation to the different moral
   objects in virtue of the differences of which the moral action itself
   assumes a different form.

SUBDIVISION FIRST.

THE MORAL ACTIVITY PER SE IN ITS INNER DIFFERENCES.

  SECTION XCIX.

   As moral action always seeks to effect a harmony between the acting
   person and the moral object, hence it stands in relation, on the one
   hand, to the former as its starting-point, and, on the other, to the
   latter as the goal aimed at by the life-movement. This harmony can
   consequently be effected in a twofold manner,--either in that the
   object becomes for the subject, or the subject for the object, that is,
   either by appropriation or by formation. As, however, every entity, in
   so far as it is good, has a right in and of itself, hence it has such a
   right also as bearing upon the morally active person, so that neither
   the appropriating nor the forming is without some degree of limitation,
   but both must respect this right of the object. The two forms of moral
   action have therefore, as a necessary limit, a third form of moral
   bearing, namely, a bearing by which the moral object is preserved in
   its rights,--moral sparing.

   This third form of the moral bearing, which, as an activity of the
   will, has of course a moral character, has been very largely ignored in
   ethics, or at least left in the back-ground, and it is even severely
   criticised in its defenders, and yet it is a sphere of very essential
   duties, duties which can be classed into other spheres only by manifest
   violence, and which yet consist, in fact, neither in appropriation nor
   in formation. When I check my foot in order not wantonly to crush an
   ant that is crossing my path, this is in fact a moral self-limitation,
   but it cannot be properly classed as moral forming, seeing that the end
   of this action is very evidently the to-be-spared animal, and not the
   acting person. But every moral action without exception is also a moral
   self-forming, a self-cultivating, without, however, that this
   self-culture should always appear as the end proper. Without the proper
   respecting of the duty of sparing, appropriation and formation would
   become violence. But the moral motive of all right action, namely,
   love, implies in its very nature also the exercising of preservative
   sparing; man cannot love an object, and yet not seek to preserve it in
   the beloved peculiarity of its being. Sparing is not of a mere negative
   character, a mere limiting of another action, but it is essentially
   different from all other action; it is of a negative character only in
   form but not in contents. When I do not severely reproach a person who
   is inwardly and deeply ashamed and humiliated because of his sin, but
   tenderly spare him, this is not a mere non-doing of that which I might
   do, not a mere limiting of my punitive activity, but it is the very
   opposite of this. There results here from the moral motive, that is,
   love, not a positive acting upon the other, but a restraining of such
   action; and if I thereby heap coals of fire upon the head of an enemy,
   and thus profit him morally, still this is not a real influential
   forming on my part, but a giving place for the moral self-forming of
   the other; my sparing procedure here is indeed mediately a forming, as,
   on the other hand, it is also a self-mastering; per se however, it is
   an action different from both. When, in the sphere of the freedom of
   rational creatures, God restrains his immediate action in order to
   preserve them in their freedom,--when God spared Cain, and, after the
   flood, promised henceforth to spare living creatures as a whole [Gen.
   iv, 15; viii, 21; ix, 11 sqq.],--this is simply a divine example of
   moral sparing. To spare is often more difficult morally than to
   appropriate or to influence, for in the latter cases the person has a
   lively consciousness of self, and stands forth prominently with his own
   rights and his enjoyment of activity; but, in sparing, it is the right
   of the object that stands in the foreground, and the actor must
   recognize and respect this right, and must morally overcome his
   personal will and his pleasure in self-assertion. Sparing is the
   preservative, the "conservative," phase of the moral life, and its
   carrying-out presupposes greater moral maturity than the exercise of
   the appropriating or forming activities; for the youthful zeal of the
   morally immature spirit, its practice is exceedingly difficult; not to
   crush the bruised reed, nor to quench the smoking wick [Matt. xii, 20],
   is more difficult, and involves a higher moral wisdom, than to destroy
   or to create anew.--As the sparing procedure is logically the most
   immediate course of conduct, and rather a withholding than an express
   acting, hence it is more appropriate to treat of it first.

I. MORAL SPARING.

  SECTION C.

   Moral sparing is a self-limiting of personal action in the interest of
   the rights of the object; the latter is neither appropriated nor formed
   by the person, but simply let alone in its peculiar being and nature.
   The duty of sparing rests upon the right of every natural or spiritual
   and historical entity to its existence and its peculiarity, in so far
   as these are good, and hence upon love to the object as being
   good,--consequently, in the final instance, upon a pious world theory,
   upon love to God. The entity is spared because it bears in itself the
   impress of the Eternal,--is an expression of the will of God; hence
   sparing is moral only in so far as it relates to the good and the
   divine ill existence, and not to that which by virtue of its ungodly
   nature should be an object of moral hatred.--The higher the perfection
   of an object, so much the higher is also its right to moral sparing;
   the less the perfection, the more the object falls within the sphere of
   appropriation and formation. The highest object of moral sparing among
   created things is man, and whatever exists through and for him; but,
   above all, his moral personality itself, and hence also his honor. God
   himself cannot indeed be an object of moral sparing in the strict sense
   of the word, but lie is such, however, in the forms of his revelation
   in time, and in all that symbolically represents him.

   An indiscriminate sparing would be simply spiritual and moral sloth or
   indifference, and hence immoral. The sparing of the anti-godly is a
   sinning against God, is the withholding of moral love. An evil
   existence has indeed also, in so far as any good still inheres in it, a
   right to be spared,--only, however, in that which it has of good. The
   right to be spared is not, of course, in the case of finite existences,
   of an unlimited and unconditional character, and in the case of
   nature-objects it is much more limited than with personal beings,
   though indeed it never sinks entirely to zero. It is true, nature is
   destined to service under the dominion of the rational spirit, and, in
   so far as it reaches this destination, man has in fact a right to pass
   beyond the limits of mere sparing restraint, and actively to lay hold
   on the very existence of nature, transforming and appropriating it.
   Where the right of the personal spirit is not recognized, where God is
   conceived of as a mere nature-entity, there pious morality manifests
   itself in a wide-reaching sparing of natural objects, far beyond the
   measure of what is required of us; so is it with the Brahmins and the
   Buddhists; and, especially in the case of the former, this
   over-delicate sparing of natural objects is associated with a cruel
   un-sparingness toward themselves.

   As the duty of sparing rests on the right of each particular being to
   its own peculiarity, hence this duty as well as this right rise in
   scope in proportion to the degree of the individual perfection. That
   which is absolutely perfect bears the character of eternity and
   unchangeableness, and though it may indeed be spiritually appropriated,
   yet it cannot in any respect be formed or changed. In the process of
   education, the dictating influence upon the child falls into the
   background in proportion as the child grows toward moral maturity.
   Lifeless matter has no claim to sparing. When the Brahmin does not
   allow himself causelessly to crush the least earth-clod, this is simply
   because he regards it as the sacred body of Brahma. Plants have a
   better claim to be spared than inorganic objects, and the more so the
   higher their organization, and especially as they stand in a closer
   relation to man; to injure fruit-trees and other edible vegetation,
   without cause, is regarded as sinful even by uncultured tribes. The
   more an object enters into the sphere of man's spiritual life, the more
   it bears the impress of the spirit, constituting, as it were, a sort of
   larger corporeality for man, so much the higher is its claim upon
   sparing. This is especially the case with the human body itself, as the
   organ of the spirit, as a "temple of the Holy Ghost;" in the next rank
   stand all such natural objects as hold a relation to the spiritual
   life, and which are mementos of important events and of spiritual
   effort in general,--every thing, in fine, that has been actually
   produced by the human spirit, and the more so in proportion as it is of
   a spiritualized character,--and hence, especially, all products of
   industry and art. But the highest right to sparing is possessed by the
   personal spirit itself in its personal peculiarity; to assail the honor
   of another is to wound his moral being; the higher the moral culture
   and maturity of a person, the higher is also his right to moral
   sparing; by sin this right is necessarily largely forfeited.

   While the heathen idol falls, of course, within the sphere of human
   sparing, the eternal and almighty God stands beyond the scope of this
   activity. Nevertheless there are sacred duties which express, in a
   certain sense, a sparing of the divine; the name of God and his honor
   are to be held sacred; and whatever is a symbol of the divine, or is a
   reminder of God's presence, has an especial claim to moral sparing;
   even uncultured tribes practice a reverential sparing in regard to all
   that is sacred or stands in relation to the divine in contradistinction
   to the worldly and the profane. From the simple fact of the sparing of
   whatever stands in real, or even in symbolical, relation to God, it is
   very evident, of how great significancy is piety for morality. The
   pious mind finds God's being and providence in all things and in all
   life, and whatever is not hostile to God is, for it, sacred and an
   object of pious sparing. The higher the piety of the person, so much
   the higher becomes the worth, and hence also the right, of all
   existence, in so far as this existence is good. He who is impious has
   no reverence for created things,--no tenderness toward them. Not to
   spare that which has a right to sparing, is moral rudeness. The immoral
   and the impious are uniformly rude and coarse; they have indeed fear
   but no awe.

   Sparing is, as a non-doing, only then moral when it is a conscious and
   freely-willed withholding of a real out-going action, that is, when it
   is an inner activity, a moral self-controlling out of respect for
   another's right, and when it is in real harmony with moral forming and
   appropriating, so as not in any manner to interfere therewith,--that
   is, when it is the virtualizing of the real rights of the moral object.
   The formable or cultivable object has, however, just as good a right to
   be formed as it has to be spared. In so far as sparing is a mere
   non-influencing of the objective entity, it is not yet moral, and may
   even also be evil. The spiritually indolent declines even this form of
   activity, not, however, from love to the object, but from mere
   selfishness. Only that sparing is morally good which rests on love to
   the object, and which therefore implies a conscious self-limitation and
   self-controlling, and which is, consequently, only in outer form, but
   not in inner essence, a mere non-doing; mere non-doing would be per se
   sinful, inasmuch as the moral life must always be active, and it is
   only the seeming non-doing which, however, is an inner-doing, that can
   be moral. True moral sparing is, in relation to beings that are.
   formable and in need of formation, uniformly also a formative
   influence, namely, in that it gives proper play for legitimate
   self-forming on the part of the object. A tyrannical education that
   extends its tutorial dictation into all the minute details, produces
   not a moral character but only servile-mindedness. All right education
   must also practice, in the interest of the training of moral freedom, a
   wise sparing,--must allow the child the possibility of determining
   itself independently, and of thereby maturing itself toward moral
   freedom. As the sparing of a growing plant is at the same time also a
   furthering of it, so also, and even in a higher degree, is this true of
   sparing as exercised toward rational beings; the pardoning of an
   offense exercises frequently a very fruitful influence on the moral
   development of him who is pardoned.

II. MORAL APPROPRIATING.

  SECTION CI.

   In the appropriating activity man effects his unity with the objective
   entity, by taking it up into himself,--by uniting it with himself, by
   making it an element of his own nature. This moral activity differs
   both in regard to what element of the object is appropriated by the
   actor, and in regard to how this takes place.

   (a) According to what element of the object is appropriated, the
   appropriating is either natural or spiritual; the latter is the more
   comprehensive, and extends itself to all objective existence,--also to
   God.--Natural appropriation relates as well to the existence and
   preservation of the individual person as to the existence and
   preservation of the species, and is the necessary condition of both. In
   both respects, therefore, man is bound to nature and stimulated by
   natural instinct, and although in this respect he is freer than the
   brute, and all the freer the higher his personality is developed,
   nevertheless in respect to the preservation of the existence of the
   subject, this freedom is still always of a limited character, and the
   law of nature is, in many respects, stronger than the will, though,
   however, not so potent as to force the will to the immoral.

   All natural existence is at the same time also of spiritual
   significance,--is a realized thought, the expression of an idea. But
   as, on the other hand, not every spiritual entity is connected with a
   natural one, hence spiritual appropriating is of greater compass and
   higher significancy than the merely natural. The higher moral worth of
   the former appears also from this, that it preserves the objective
   existence in its reality, whereas natural appropriation more or less
   destroys it. With the increase of moral and spiritual growth, natural
   appropriation constantly gives place more and more to the spiritual;
   with the child the former predominates; but what is normal in the child
   becomes immoral in mature age.

   In natural appropriation there is manifested a real and normal
   limitation of free self-determination. When hunger predominates, the
   spiritual forces subside, and at last it becomes even mightier than the
   free determinations of the will. Nevertheless this power of nature over
   the will is neither unlimited nor absolutely definitive, but the moral
   will is capable of asserting its autonomy against it. It may indeed
   enfeeble the bodily force and therewith also the spiritual, but it
   cannot absolutely determine the will. Christ cried out indeed on the
   cross: "I thirst;" but when hungering in the desert he resisted the
   temptation. The fact that from grief or despair persons have starved
   themselves to death, proves at least that the will is capable of being
   stronger than nature, even under its most overpowering phases. He who
   in the last desperation of famine lays hold on human life to satiate
   his hunger [Lev. xxvi, 29] commits a crime even in the eyes of human
   law, and the violence of hunger forms no excuse. That also in this
   respect a great difference is to be made between man as unfallen and
   man as enslaved to sin, we have already observed.

  SECTION CII.

   Natural appropriating per se is not yet a moral activity, but it is
   extra-moral, and therefore when it appears in and of itself as the
   substance and chief-end of life, it is immoral. It becomes morally good
   only when it is the expression of an under-lying spiritual
   appropriating, that is, when it does not rest on mere sensuous impulse,
   but on conscious love, not so much to the sensuous object per se as
   rather to God who lovingly gives it to us. This implies further that,
   with a moral person, the natural appropriating should never predominate
   over the spiritual,--that not the attendant sensuous enjoyment per se
   should be regarded as the essential and proper object of effort, but
   rather the rational God-willed end of the sensuous, so that
   consequently the sensuous enjoyment should be aimed at only in so far
   as the moral purpose admits of it.

   There is per se forbidden to man, irrespective of his sinfulness, no
   natural temperate sensuous appropriating; this is plainly seen in the
   account of Paradise and in the example and deed of Christ at the
   wedding of Cana. Thankfulness to God sanctifies even the sensuous
   appropriation of his gifts [1 Tim. iv, 3-5]. The Christian custom of
   saying grace at meals, after the example of Christ [Matt. xiv, 19; xv,
   36], which prevailed also generally in the ancient church [Acts xxvii,
   35; Tert. Apol., 39], has a high moral significancy; it rescues the
   natural enjoyment from the stage of mere sensuousness,--elevates it
   into the sphere of the moral. As even in the opinion of worldly society
   the significancy of social repasts consists not in the sensuous
   enjoyment, but in the intellectual entertainment and interchange of
   sentiment, so according to Christian morals the significancy of all
   sensuous appropriation consists in its relation to God,--in the
   appropriating of the divine in and through the bread and wine of daily
   food. "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all
   to the glory of God" [1 Cor. x, 30, 31]. But man does not give God the
   glory when he forgets Him and finds pleasure merely in the sensuous.
   God neither forbids nor begrudges to man the enjoyment of the sensuous,
   but he forbids a beastly merging of one's self into it. He who forgets
   the Giver in the gift sinks below the sphere of the moral and even of
   the human. The world at large is not fond of grace-saying, and yet even
   the heathen made his libations to the gods at his repasts. Even
   Schleiermacher (Christl. Sitte, Beil., p. 33) found in the just-cited
   words of Paul simply an assumption of the animal
   element--food-taking--"into the sphere of social pleasure," "in order
   to chasten mere sensuous desire," and he is unable to discover any
   significancy in the saying of grace.

   The observing of moderation in natural appropriation, the regarding it
   as a mere means to the rational end of preserving the individual as
   well as the species, is not merely a moral preserving of the person but
   also of the object,--is a doing of justice toward the object. He who is
   temperate simply, e. g., in order not to injure his health, is not yet
   moral, but only self-seeking. Appropriation finds its measure in the
   moral duty of sparing. All natural appropriating is more or less a
   destroying of the objective entity; and, as the latter has per se a
   right to sparing, it follows that the limit of appropriation is not a
   merely subjective one. The nightingale-tongue pies of the Roman
   epicures are not mentioned with detestation simply because they are a
   mere immoderation, but because they involved an injustice against the
   right of nature to be spared. And many modern table-luxuries are not of
   a much more innocent character.

   In sexual appropriation the moral is conditioned not merely, as in the
   use of natural objects, on thankful love to God as the giver,
   but--inasmuch as the object appropriated is itself a moral
   personality--also on personal love to the same. Without this love the
   person of the object would be treated as a mere impersonality, as a
   mere nature-object, and its validity as a personal moral spirit
   ignored. Upon this moral recognition of the personality Scripture lays
   great emphasis. "Adam knew Eve, his wife;" the same expression (yd) is
   very frequently used of wedlock communion, also on the part of the
   woman [Gen. xix, 8; Num. xxxi, 17]. This is usually explained as a mere
   euphemism, but it is in fact the appropriate expression to the essence
   of the matter. The persons mutually recognize each other as
   personalities bound to each other in full reciprocal
   possession,--recognize, each, himself in the other and the other in
   himself--recognize the complete belonging of each to the other in
   virtue of a mutual love which precludes every thing that is strange or
   disuniting, so that consequently the two constitute truly one soul and
   one flesh. The expression to "know," to recognize, refers therefore
   primarily solely to legitimate wedlock cohabitation, and was applied
   only subsequently and improperly also to sinful.

   Sexual appropriation also is in part a destruction, a despoiling of the
   person, which finds a compensation only in the fact that the one person
   belongs to the other as an inalienable possession--that both persons
   are united to an indissoluble life in common. Hence the commerce of the
   sexes without marriage is self-profanation; and virginity is esteemed
   among all, not absolutely barbarous nations as an inviolable treasure
   to which only that one has a right who is united in his whole
   personality to the person of the virgin. And even within the limits of
   marriage each party has a right to sparing, and should not be degraded
   into a mere object of sensuous pleasure; also here there is a measure
   that is conditioned on the end, and the transgressing of which is a
   dishonoring, a degrading. of the consort.

  SECTION CIII.

   2.--Spiritual appropriation relates to all objective existence, nature
   included, and takes up the spiritual contents thereof into the being of
   the self-conscious subject,--makes it its personal possession. The
   moral subject enlarges thus its own spiritual being,--receives the
   universe as well as God into itself,--forms for itself an inner world
   which, as a copy of the real world, realizes under its subjective phase
   the moral end, namely, the effecting of the harmony of existence.

   In spiritual appropriation, as the far richer field of this activity,
   the appropriated object is in no wise destroyed, but on the contrary
   preserved, nay, brought to its higher truth, namely, in that its
   spiritual contents not only exist per se, but also exist for the
   spirit, and have now in the spirit a continued existence even after the
   object itself outwardly perishes. That which has become a part of
   history and science has thereby attained to imperishableness. That
   which externally perishes, the natural existence, is the inferior, the
   less essential; that which is capable of becoming a possession of the
   immortal spirit is, in fact, the higher,--the essence, the idea, the
   spiritual contents of existence. In virtue of their spiritual contents
   even natural objects receive a sort of immortality by being
   appropriated by the rational spirit; in a still higher degree is this
   true of the facts of history. Spiritual appropriation is related to
   natural appropriation as the spirit to the body; the latter must
   therefore always be subordinate to the former,--must absolutely serve
   it.--As all nature is created not only by spirit but also for spirit,
   and as whatever is spiritually created is likewise for the spirit,
   hence it is but justice to both natural and historical existence,--but
   a simple right of the same upon the rational spirit,--that it be
   appropriated by the latter, and it is a perfectly moral requirement
   that spiritual appropriating be made an essential part of the moral
   activity. Only savages know nothing of history, of the permanent
   preservation of the transitory. The preservation of that which belongs
   to the spirit, that which has been appropriated by it, is the earliest
   evidence of the spiritual, the historical character of a people,--of
   human culture. The most ancient historical nations of heathendom, the
   Chinese and the Egyptians, place their chief interest in the preserving
   of transpired events; the Egyptians sought to rescue from perishing
   even the bodies of men, as the tabernacles of the spirit,--sought to
   appropriate them to history. The art of writing has as its original
   purpose, not mutual personal intercourse, but history,--was committed
   not to perishable leaves but to the rock; and also the most ancient
   products of architectural skill were consecrated, not to purposes of
   dwellings, but to purposes of history.

  SECTION CIV.

   (b) The difference of spiritual appropriation in respect to how it
   takes place, appears, on the one hand, in this, that the appropriating
   person is active as a rational spirit in general,--as at one with all
   other rational spirits, and hence in such a manner as that the
   appropriation might be made in like manner by any other
   spirit,--general appropriation; and, on the other, in this, that the
   person is active as a single personality for himself,--appropriates the
   object to himself as an individual, makes it his exclusive
   possession,--particular appropriation.--(1) General (universal)
   appropriation is cognizing or learning. The object is indeed received
   by the individual spirit and into it, not, however, as its exclusive
   possession; on the contrary, in this receiving, the person divests
   himself at the same time of his isolated character,--has the
   appropriated not as a mere particular possession for himself, but as a
   possession of the rational spirit in general,--as universally-valid.
   The so appropriated spiritual possession is truth; now truth has the
   destination and tendency to become a common possession. Learning or
   cognizing is therefore moral: (a) in that it seeks to appropriate to
   itself the real spiritual contents of existence, that is, seeks after
   truth; (b) in that it makes of truth, not a personal isolated
   enjoyment, but strives to communicate it to others.

   All learning is spiritual appropriating, but not all spiritual
   appropriating is general; we here consider spiritual appropriation
   under another phase than in the preceding section. Where the love of
   sensuous enjoyment prevails to a sinful extent, there the love of truth
   declines. The desire of knowledge is a characteristic of the moral
   spirit. Man, as called to dominion over nature, is also called to the
   spiritual appropriating of the same, and of all existence. The striving
   after truth is a seal of man's God-likeness. Even as to God every thing
   is open, and all truth is known, so also is man only then truly a
   spirit when he strives after truth and seeks cognoscitively to
   appropriate to himself all things. This is a legitimate striving after
   possession,--after the possession of an inner world, a true copy of the
   real one; and it is among the most essential sources of the bliss of
   the perfected, that they know the truth and constantly appropriate to
   themselves cognoscitively more of it. The acquiring of the truth is a
   becoming free from the limits of a merely individual existence,--a
   divesting ourselves of the mere state of nature, an assuming of a more
   general character, an entering into the life and essence of the
   self-concordant All, an appropriating of the objective outgoings of
   spirit in general. "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make
   you free," says Christ to such as shall continue in his word [John
   viii, 32]. Even as light breaks down the isolation of individual being,
   and throws up a bridge to that which is outwardly separated from it,
   thus causing all separate objects to exist in some sort for each other,
   so the knowledge of truth frees man from the bonds of a merely isolated
   being, opens for him the totality of existence as his
   life-sphere,--throws a unifying bond around deity and the totality of
   his creatures. As no life of the earth is without light, so also is
   there no life of the spirit without the knowledge of truth; and it is
   not this or that truth that makes man free, rational, and blessed, but
   the truth; and the Spirit of the Lord strives to lead his disciples
   into all truth. Whoever seeks to set limits to the moral thirst for
   truth, whoever declares any truth as indifferent or unworthy of effort,
   he resists the outgoings of the spirit of truth. Moreover, there is no
   particular truth which stands isolated and for itself, and does not
   first receive its validity from the truth which springs from the
   eternal Spirit of God; and he who thinks to satisfy the thirst of the
   soul for truth with certain separate morsels of truths from the sphere
   of the finite and transitory, knows not the truth but only falsehood.

   All true knowing is of such a nature that every other rational spirit
   can and must know in precisely the same manner, and hence has a
   significance beyond the possession of the individual,--is general
   appropriation. Hence, as moral, it is also directly connected with a
   tendency to make that which is appropriated by the individual person a
   general possession of all rational beings. The moral man cannot wish to
   retain the truth for himself alone, but the truth which has become his
   possession impels him, by virtue of its general character, freely to
   communicate it to others [Luke ii, 17; 1 John i, 1 sqq.]. The duty of
   secret-keeping has a validity and significancy only on the supposition
   of predominant sinfulness,--is inconceivable save on the presupposition
   of sin; and the weakness of being unable to keep a secret springs, in
   some sort at least, from a correct feeling of that which ought to be.
   Goodhearted persons are usually poor secret-keepers; and for innocence
   there is no secret. The truth, like light, cannot hide itself; it is
   only with designing effort that either can be concealed. Truth, morally
   considered, belongs not to the mere understanding but to the heart; and
   with that of which the heart is full, the mouth overflows [Luke vi,
   45]. He to whom the truth belongs, belongs also himself to the
   truth,--must also bear witness of the truth. "We cannot but speak the
   things which we have seen and heard," said Peter and John in the
   presence of the chief council [Acts iv, 20], and they only express the
   inner moral necessity of such a witnessing of obtained truth. Whoever
   feels nothing of such an inner impulsion to witnessing either possesses
   not the truth, or the truth possesses not him. With the witnessing of
   the truth it is in some sense as it is with the first ante-moral love;
   the person may indeed resist the inner impulse, but if he does not do
   so then his immediate love of the truth will spontaneously induce him
   to witness for it without any need of a special effort of the will. "Ye
   also will bear witness (as well as the Holy Ghost), because ye have
   been with me from the beginning," says the Lord to his disciples [John
   xv, 27]; this is not an injunction but a promise; they will not be able
   to do otherwise; the truth is stronger than the command. Hence he who
   is of the truth needs no longer the law; for the truth impels him to
   bear witness of itself through his life.

  SECTION CV.

   (2). Particular (individual) appropriating is enjoying. Here the object
   exists solely for me in so far as I am an individual being,--becomes my
   special possession. In enjoyment I do not, as in cognizing, have the
   object purely as such, but I have it as it stands in accord with my
   peculiarity, as it has become an element of my own being. In enjoyment
   I have, therefore, always also myself as in some way affected by the
   object; hence the sphere of enjoyment is essentially feeling, namely,
   the feeling of pleasure. Enjoyment is either sensuous or spiritual; the
   former is never moral per se, but only with and in the latter.--As the
   personal spirit has an independent right, in and of itself, and as true
   enjoyment rests on love to the object, and consequently is a
   virtualization of this love, hence enjoyment is also a moral right, and
   therefore also relatively a duty. The morality of enjoyment consists
   primarily in a conscious and complete subordinating of merely sensuous
   enjoyment to spiritual; and furthermore in the fact that it be always a
   pure expression of moral love, and hence also of thankfulness, and that
   it rest on joy in God,--that it stand in proper harmony with the
   formative activity; and also in the fact that, by virtue of the
   agreeable feeling manifested in it, it awake also communicative love,
   namely, the tendency to extend the enjoyment to others.--The highest
   enjoyment consists in the consciousness of the filial relation to God,
   that is, in the perfect appropriation of life-communion with God; and
   in fact to the child of God, only that is a real enjoyment, in which
   also God has pleasure. In association with this enjoyment of the filial
   relation to God, every other enjoyment is sanctified.

   In learning, or cognizing, I throw into the back-ground my isolated
   individuality,--let the truth, as general, rule over me; my mere
   isolated being has no validity; in enjoying, on the contrary, I come
   with my separate individuality into the fore-ground; the object per se
   has no validity; in learning I have myself only as a member of the
   whole, but in enjoying I have myself as an individuality distinct from
   the whole. Hence enjoyment, as of such and such a form, is not
   communicable; de gustibus non est disputandum. Whatever one rational
   person cognizes as true, that must be cognized by all as true; but that
   which is an enjoyment for one is not necessarily such for another. All
   enjoyment is love, and the highest earthly love is conjugal and
   maternal love; but this love which is at the same time the highest
   earthly enjoyment, belongs to this or that particular person,--is by no
   means personally-communicable; a child can be loved by no one else as
   it is by its mother. As knowledge naturally impels to communication, so
   enjoyment, on the contrary, impels rather to isolation; the
   pleasure-seeker would fain have every thing for himself; if he seeks
   society, it is only in so far as society becomes to him an object of
   enjoyment. Enjoyment readily gives rise to jealousy, whereas knowledge
   tends to a liberal imparting of the acquired truth; even maternal love
   knows jealousy.

   Christian morality begrudges not enjoyment to man, not even the
   sensuous, for "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof" [1
   Cor. x, 6; Psa. xxiv, 1; comp. Gen. ii, 9]. The pious reference of all
   enjoyment to God as the Giver of all good, and thankful love to him,
   render even sensuous enjoyment moral, in so far as it is sought in the
   divinely-ordained manner,--spiritualize it, in fact, by the
   heart-disposition of the subject, and place the joy proper in the
   spiritual associations of the sensuous. So soon as sensuous enjoyment
   is sought purely for itself, apart from the spiritual and from love to
   God, it becomes at once immoral, seeing that it then interrupts (§ 102)
   the spiritual life, which by its very nature is continuous; of the
   relation of enjoyment to forming, we will speak hereafter.

   The communication of enjoyment,--a constituent element of its
   morality,--springs not from the essence of the same, but from love to
   man in general. It can only take place in so far as thereby the essence
   of the enjoyment is not affected; the enjoyment that lies in the
   family-life can never be made a common possession; and the fact that in
   the case of a few rude tribes, hospitality is extended to a
   communicating even of marital rights, [12] is evidence simply of a
   perversion of the moral. Manifestly, however, wedlock-happiness and
   that of the family in general require, in order to their being moral,
   that they be communicated to others, not, however, as a direct
   enjoyment, but through hospitality,--through the throwing open of the
   family to friendly intercourse, through the permitting of others to
   share in the inner peace of the domestic life. Hence there is not
   lacking a moral back-ground for the custom of reserving the higher
   sensuous enjoyment of repasts for hospitable occasions, in which the
   spiritual intercourse, and hence spiritual enjoyment, occupies the
   fore-ground, while the sensuous enjoyment appears only as an attendant
   in the back-ground. The idea of Paradise is the epitome of the entire
   circle of true enjoyments,--it is not a mere crude or childish
   fancy-creation, but the very truth itself. Christian morality is not
   averse to enjoyment; it favors man's taking delight in this world of
   reality. But Paradise exists only where man is in filial communion with
   the divine Father,--where love to God sanctifies all earthly enjoyment.
   "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and
   peace, and joy, in the Holy Ghost" [Rom. xiv, 17]. Christianity knows
   no other joy than joy in the Lord; "Rejoice in the Lord always, and
   again I say, Rejoice" [Phil. iv, 4]. He who rejoices in the Lord, takes
   true delight in all that comes from the Lord [Deut. xxvi, 11]. To man
   as sinful many enjoyments are forbidden, because he is able to enjoy
   them only sinfully; to the pure the sphere of morally-pure enjoyment is
   much wider and richer [Titus i, 15]. The child of God has enjoyment in
   every thing, and every thing is to him a moral enjoyment, save alone
   the violation of God's law; to him the world is a paradise, for it is
   God's, as is also himself; and he loves not the world without God, but
   only in God and with God. The blessedness of the children of God, the
   unspeakable enjoyment of true heart-devotion in fervent prayer, in
   which man knows himself at one with his God, and rests in the peace of
   God, is not a subject for scientific synthesis and analytical
   description; it belongs to the sphere of the inner life, and needs to
   be experienced rather than described; the world knows nothing thereof.

  III. MORAL FORMING.

  SECTION CVI.

   Moral forming works the harmony of existence, in that thereby man
   impresses upon objective existence the peculiarity of his own
   spirit,--makes it an expression thereof, that is, spiritually shapes
   it. The object is destroyed not in its existence, but only in its
   isolation and peculiarity,--receives the peculiarity of the acting
   spirit, is imbued with, and thus bound to, it. Forming is morally good
   not when it is an impressing of the merely individual and as yet not
   morally-rational spirit upon the object (for this would be injustice to
   the object, a non-sparing of its legitimate being), but when it is an
   impressing of the spirit as moral, as rational and as in harmony with
   God, that is, when the object itself is formed toward a complete
   harmony with the morally-rational collective spirit. Moral forming must
   therefore always be associated with moral sparing, and all the more so
   the higher the spiritual significance and worth of the object that is
   to be formed. As related to the moral spirit, therefore, all moral
   forming is an educating, which latter is never an absolutely
   all-determining forming, but a forming that respects the rights of the
   personality that is to be formed.

   The outward-going formative activity can neither be arbitrary and
   purposeless, nor a mere destroying of that which exists, but must have
   a rational end and a right of its own. In view of the wants of the
   moral activity, therefore, created existence cannot be, primarily, at
   once and definitively completed and perfected, though indeed it is
   good, but it stands in the presence of the activity of the rational
   spirit as formable material to which man, as active, has a right, and
   the final completion of which is an end for human activity. It is only
   through forming that man makes the objective world his own, namely, in
   that he impresses upon it his stamp, and makes it by moral activity
   into a likeness of himself, and therefore into his own possession. "Do
   your own business (prassein ta idia) and work with your own hands" [1
   Thess. iv, 11]; man really possesses nothing as his own but that which
   he has produced by working and forming; and it is not a curse but an
   original moral law of the universe, that the true existence of man,
   bodily as well as spiritually-moral, is conditioned on formative
   working, on labor. Even the first man was not placed in Paradise simply
   to enjoy its delights, simply to appropriate to himself, naturally and
   spiritually, that which already existed, but he was to cultivate the
   garden [Gen. ii, 15]. Man is called to dominion over nature, to be a
   creator of a spiritual World; this is both a wide and also a
   privileging and obligating field for the moral. The play of the child
   is a forming; that of the brute has no objective significancy; and
   wherever by virtue of an instinct, the brute exercises a formative
   activity, there we are simply presented with a natural symbol of the
   moral, as in the case of the bee, the ant, etc.

   Forming, as compared to sparing and appropriating, appears at once as
   the higher, and generally more difficult, form of activity; sparing is
   a mere checking of the outward-going activity; appropriating, according
   to its kind, either annihilates the objective existence, or leaves its
   substance untouched; but forming interferes positively with the
   existence and peculiarity of the object. There is need here, on the one
   hand, of a considerate respecting of the right of the object to its own
   peculiarity, so that the forming may not become an unjust perverting
   and destroying, and, on the other hand, of a proper and clear
   consciousness of the rational purpose of the transforming.
   Appropriating begins earlier in the spiritual development of man than
   forming; the latter always presupposes some degree of moral maturity;
   forming as exercised by an immature spirit is a destroying. The
   formative activity of the child appears as a rending-asunder of
   whatever falls into its hand; the historical activity of savage or
   half-civilized tribes, bears also this childish character. Unripe youth
   have also, as relating to society and the state and to historical
   reality in general, great pleasure in destruction; and the
   revolutionary spirit of boisterous young men is only a higher degree of
   the destructive proclivity of the child; but on the supposition of the
   attainment of higher spiritual maturity, that which is innocent in the
   child becomes a culpable lack of judgment. Moral forming must
   necessarily always have also a preserving phase, inasmuch as in all
   that which is to be formed there is also something that has a right to
   existence, and hence a claim upon sparing; and an education which
   ignores this right in the pupil, is violent and therefore immoral.

  SECTION CVII.

   Moral forming differs likewise in two respects. (a) According to that
   which is formed in the object, it is either a sensuously-natural or a
   spiritual forming.--1. Natural forming is a shaping of nature-material
   for the human spirit by virtue of the mastery of the spirit over
   nature, to the end either of practical utility or of a manifesting of
   spirit in art-work. Nature, as created, is indeed per se good and
   perfect, but it becomes a true home for, a true organ of, the spirit
   and of history, only by becoming imbued with spirit. Natural forming is
   moral and rational only in so far as it is the sensuous expressing of a
   spiritual forming.

   All dominating is necessarily a forming, inasmuch as the dominated is
   more or less an expression of the will of the dominating power. A
   natural entity can bear this expression only in virtue of being shaped
   by man and at the same time for man. In natural forming the difference
   between man, as a moral creature, and the brute, becomes at once
   plainly visible. The activity of the brute is predominantly a sensuous
   appropriating; that of man is predominantly a forming, and indeed
   primarily a sensuously-natural forming. The appropriating of nature is
   primarily permitted by God to man, and is limited by a prohibition only
   in one respect; the forming of nature is enjoined upon him [Gen. i, 28;
   ii, 15]. The mere letting alone of even a Paradisaical nature in its
   given condition, is for man per se immoral; he is called to form it
   into a home for himself by his personal activity.--But man cannot
   morally accomplish a natural forming save on the condition that there
   exists already in him an antecedent moral forming. The artist cannot
   create a work of art unless it has already been spiritually formed in
   his soul; and each and every object that is shaped, is to be, in its
   entire purpose, not a mere solitary something existing for itself, but
   rather one of the stones of a greater and essentially-spiritual
   structure,--the structure of history. Man shapes nature not for its own
   sake but for humanity, namely, into a home for man's spiritual life,
   into an expression of historical reality,--which is essentially the
   product of spiritual forming. Hence natural forming has always the
   purpose simply of serving the spiritual, even as the nourishment and
   development of the body take place not in the interest of the body, but
   of the spirit.

  SECTION CVIII.

   Spiritual forming relates to the spiritual essence of the object, and
   hence predominantly to the conscious spirit; it is a communicating of
   the spiritual possession of the subject to the object, a shaping of the
   object according to the rational idea of the subject, a putting of the
   former into harmony with the moral person of the latter. Each man has
   the duty of helping spiritually to form every other one who comes into
   spiritual relation with him, that is, of communicating to him his own
   moral nature, of revealing himself to him; this holds good even of the
   as yet morally immature in relation to the morally mature. All
   morally-spiritual communicating is a forming, and all spiritual forming
   is a communicating. Communicating is, however, only then a moral
   forming, when the communicating spirit itself stands in harmony with
   God, is itself morally good, and when its motive is love.

   Also spiritual forming extends in a certain sense to nature-objects, in
   so far as these are not a mere sensuous existence, but have also
   spiritual contents. The training and ennobling of domestic animals is
   not a sensuous but a relatively-spiritual forming, inasmuch as their
   inner nature is raised to a higher plane. The chief sphere of spiritual
   forming is, however, the personal spirit. Man has neither the right nor
   the liberty to develop himself as a mere isolated individual,--he
   cannot develop himself morally save when in spiritual life-relation
   with the moral community; and each stands with every other in such a
   moral relation. And this relation is a mutual forming and
   appropriating, at the same time. Man is formed only by appropriating to
   himself spiritual elements, that is, in that another spirit reveals
   itself to him. Forming cannot take place morally by the imbuing of
   thoughts and sentiments that are foreign to the subject himself into
   the spirit that is to be educated, for this would be deception, and
   would not establish a spiritual communion; it can be done only by a
   self-revelation of the moral spirit. Only the morally-formed spirit can
   itself form; the immoral spirit can only pervert, and can do this
   successfully only when it affects morality. However, it is not
   necessary that the formative spirit should be already mature; also the
   child exerts a formative influence upon its elders.--In the condition
   of sinlessness the formative activity has no need of art or of a
   calculated plan; mere self-manifestation exercises a formative
   influence directly and of itself. All artfully-planned manners of
   influencing are evidence of lost purity, and cannot, however cunningly
   contrived, exert the power of the moral reality. The moral spirit lets
   its light shine before men that they may see its good works, and this
   light directly illumines and enlightens the spirit of others. This
   self-revelation, however, would be immoral, that is, hollow and empty,
   were it to spring from self-complacency instead of from love to others.
   It is love alone that divests this letting one's light shine of an
   appearance of parade. Loving souls hide themselves not from each other;
   true love impels to a full and genuine self-communication; and moral
   love has nothing that it would gladly or necessarily conceal.

  SECTION CIX.

   (b) According to the manner in which the objective entity is
   formatively influenced, we have to distinguish between particular and
   general forming.

   1. Particular forming forms single objects for the service of the
   earthly wants of single or several persons, that is, for use for
   temporal ends. It is therefore labor, in the proper and narrower sense
   of the word. Labor relates not merely to natural matter, but also to
   the individual spirit, in so far as the latter is to be formed for the
   temporal earthly life, and hence is spiritual as well as natural
   forming.

   All utility relates to the particular; that which is for the common
   utility is simply that which is useful for many particular persons.
   When the Rationalistic school spoke of the "common utility" of
   religion, it manifested simply very bad taste; religion is thus placed
   on a par, e. g., with a public fountain or an advertising sheet. Labor
   concerns the individual; works for the common utility, such as roads or
   canals, look not to the good of humanity as a whole, as a unity, but to
   the many individual persons whom they are to benefit; for him who does
   not use them, they have no significancy and are perhaps even offensive.
   Their utility and enjoyment fall to the individual as such, but not in
   virtue of his being a man, a rational spirit. In a work of art,
   however, one has pleasure precisely in his character of rational
   spirituality; although from another stand-point this work is of no
   "use" to him whatever. That which is to exalt the heart must be more
   than labor. Products of labor may indeed excite a general and rational
   interest, as, for example, a machine or other superior fruits of skill;
   here, however, it is not the work itself that is admired, but the art
   to which the handicraft has been exalted,--the spiritual power of
   invention, that is, the power of spirit,--not the utility, but the
   beauty or ingenuity,--not the merely individual element, but the
   spiritual, which, as such, bears upon itself the stamp of general
   significancy and validity. The actual work on a machine is performed
   not by the ingenious inventor, the master, but by the manual laborer;
   and in that which this laborer executes there is little else to admire
   than the industry, but nothing of a general interest. The end of a work
   of art is not, to be used by the individual, but to be enjoyed and
   admired universally; and it is properly regarded as a sign of spiritual
   unculture when a particular age takes delight only in the merely
   useful, in mere labor, and not also in that which transcends labor,
   namely, in art,--when the age does not also exalt labor into art. In
   the time of Rationalistic illuminism many "useless" art-structures of
   the Middle Ages, magnificent castles and churches, were converted into
   magazines and factories,--art was turned into a hand-maid of labor;
   this was certainly very "useful," but it was at the same time also an
   evidence of shameful unculture. The spirit of mere utility is but
   little removed from barbarism.

   Labor is not mere manual toil. Common usage is perfectly right when it
   speaks also, and not merely in the stricter sense of the word, of
   spiritual, intellectual, labor, and of intellectual laborers, in
   distinction from a higher spiritual and intellectual activity. The
   highest results to which the spirit can attain are not effected by
   labor; the delicate, etherial image which delights our astonished gaze
   was not painfully wrought out by the sweat of the multitude, but sprang
   forth at once from the brain of genius; but, as distinguished from this
   ideal activity of the spirit, there is another which is entitled to be
   called work in the strict sense of the word, and which consists in a
   strictly-particular forming. All spiritual activity which looks to the
   mere benefit of individuals is labor; thus, we speak of the labor of
   pupils, of official labors, etc. The pupil labors in order, by the
   appropriation of particular scientific material, to form himself as an
   individual for a calling in life; the teacher labors upon the pupil for
   the same end. All spiritual forming which looks to success in the
   world, to obtaining a position in it, is labor; hence also we may speak
   of a scientific industry; there is an immense difference between
   science as manual labor, and science as an art. When the learner,
   however, elevates himself to a more ideal activity,--when, inspired
   with enthusiasm for the true and the good, he soars above the merely
   particular, or when the teacher seeks to awaken an enthusiasm of this
   character in him, then the activity ceases to be labor and becomes a
   higher kind of forming. It is true, we sometimes speak, though in a
   less strict sense, of a laboring in the sphere of purely spiritual
   things, as, for example, in that of religion and of active love [Rom.
   xvi, 6, 12; 1 Thess. i, 3; Heb. vi, 10; 1 Cor. xv, 58; 2 Cor. vi, 5;
   xi, 27; Rev. ii, 2, 3; xiv, 13]; Paul says, "I labored more abundantly
   than they all" [1 Cor. xv, 10], and the pastor and the messenger of the
   Word may speak of their labor on souls [1 Cor. xvi, 16; 2 Cor. x, 15;
   xi, 23; 1 Thess. iii, 5; v, 12; 1 Tim. v, 17]; however, in this
   essentially figuratively-used expression [see John iv, 38; 1 Cor. iii,
   8] reference is had not to the activity per se, but to the trouble in
   overcoming obstacles (hence the words kopos and kopia) which lie not in
   the matter itself, but in other circumstances, such as the enmity of
   sinful men, the feebleness of the actor himself, etc.

  SECTION CX.

   2. General forming forms the object for a general, that is, a rational
   end,--not merely for a particular need, for temporal utility. but for
   the rational and moral spirit in general,--forms it for rational
   enjoyment, for moral approbation, i. e. into a beautiful and good
   product,--is artistic forming, in the largest sense of the word. It may
   be a sensuous as well as a spiritual forming. The natural entity
   receives a spiritual form,--becomes an expression, an image, of the
   rational spirit, an expression of harmony in general,--a work of art.
   The spiritual entity is formed into an essentially God-answering, truly
   rational character, into a beautiful soul, into a child of God.
   Religious and ideal culture in general differs essentially from
   education for a worldly calling,--aims not to make man into a "useful"
   and serviceable being, but into one in whom both God and men have
   pleasure, and who has himself pleasure in God and in all that is divine
   and beautiful,--seeks not to mold him into a merely isolated being, a
   mere citizen, a mere professional man, but seeks to bring to
   development that which is purely and truly human in him,--seeks to make
   the merely natural person into an image of the moral spirit, into a
   true image of God, into an expression of the truth. All that which is
   created by general forming is art-work; and when this forming, as
   distinguished from professional working, creates a science, then this
   science becomes itself a work of art. Hence, no general forming is
   possible without moral enthusiasm, that is, without being imbued with
   and prompted by a universal spirit which divests itself of all
   individual narrowness, and of all selfishness, and aspires to a
   universal divine ideal (§ 96).--A special phase of general forming
   constitutes the typical or symbolical activity, under which falls also
   the morally becoming.

   The fruit which is aimed at in mere work is only for the benefit of the
   individual; works of art, and the beautiful and good in general, are
   for the spiritual enjoyment of rational man as such. Also the angels
   must rejoice in heaven, not only over a sinner who repents, but also
   over all that is truly beautiful. Man forms himself into a useful, a
   skillful, a learned member of society by labor and pains-taking, but
   into a beautiful soul only by enthusiasm; this is indeed not the
   beautiful soul as improvised by sentimental novelists, but the soul
   that is beautiful in the eyes of God and of all of God's children,--the
   child-soul of a child of God, full of love and enthusiasm,--the soul of
   him who is pure of heart, and which inwardly beholds God, because God
   looks upon it with pleasure. Hence the Scriptures look upon the higher
   artistic endowment as a special gift from God [Exod. xxxi, 3, 6; xxxvi,
   1, 2].

   Art in its deepest ground and essence is religious, as in fact
   historically it is a birth of religion; this holds good. without
   exception of all nations. No religion is without art, without an ideal
   embodying of the highest ideas. Architecture, plastic art and song,
   among all nations, have sprung from religion, and are the subservient
   attendants of religion [Exod. xxxi, 2 sqq.; xxxv, 1 sqq.]; and it
   required all the ungenial one-sidedness and bald reflective tendency of
   Zwingli to banish art from the Church,--a wrong against Christian
   humanity which has, at least in some degree, been disavowed in most of
   the branches of the Reformed Church. Even worldly art, in so far as it
   has not, untrue to its essential nature, entered into the service of
   sin, is closely related to religion. It also elevates man above the
   merely individual and sensuously-natural; and, itself a birth of
   enthusiasm, it awakens also in man enthusiasm for the beautiful and the
   noble,--for that which raises him out of his isolation and
   self-seeking, and up to that which finds response in all moral souls.
   Love to art banishes rudeness,--makes the heart receptive also for the
   morally beautiful and divine. Hence the culture of art is so important
   an element in education and in the life of nations. But for this reason
   also art becomes such a demon-power, when, forgetting its nobility, it
   stoops to the role of pandering to corrupt pleasure, and when, instead
   of inspiring enthusiasm for the truly beautiful, it only aims to
   intoxicate and seduce by lustful appeals to the senses. Wherever there
   is a healthful religious life, there art and religion stand in intimate
   and mutual relations. Where faith is alive in the heart, there it
   utters itself in "psalms and spiritual songs," there it celebrates the
   glory of its God in a becoming ornamentation of his altars and courts
   [Exod. xxxv, 21 sqq.], and wherever true art prevails there it
   consecrates the most beautiful of its products to the honor of God.
   Religion created for the Greeks poets and artists, and the poets and
   artists created for the Greeks their gods; and however much there may
   have been of heathen error in these creations, still this much at least
   is here exemplified, namely, that the divine makes its nearest
   approaches to man in the words, the songs and the works of artistic
   inspiration. The prophets of the Ancient Covenant were also unable to
   bring down to the plane of mere simple prose, the visions which they
   had spiritually beholden; and also the Prophet of the New Covenant
   publishes his visions under the drapery of boldly-constructed symbols.
   He who finds fault with this knows neither art nor religion.

   General moral forming does not necessarily take place directly and
   immediately; as relating to the free spirit, it consists essentially in
   the fact that, by the moral activity of the subject, the object is so
   incited and inspired as to bring about self-development through his own
   spontaneity and strength. In this consists the true art of education
   and governing, namely, in that the guiding power hides itself in some
   respect from the spirit that is to be molded,--does not permit its
   influence upon it to appear as a limiting, overpowering force, but
   rather simply gives scope for free and independent self-development.
   This does not take place, however, by a simple "letting alone" of the
   one who is to be guided, but by the fact that the moral and rational
   consciousness is quickened and strengthened in him,--that he is brought
   to feel and know himself, not as a mere non-obligated individual, but
   as a personality inspired by a holy and moral spirit,--that a moral
   disposition and an ideal enthusiasm become in him an actuating power,
   which in turn itself forms him to a higher development and perfection.

   There is an important sphere of moral activity, namely, symbolical
   forming--to which belongs also the practicing of the becoming,--which
   can be understood only from the stand-point of general artistic
   forming;--a sphere of stumbling and offense to all champions of the
   merely prosaically useful. The morally-good, is not simply to become
   real, but the real is also to be an expression, a manifestation of the
   morally-good,--is to bear witness in its entire outward appearance to
   an inner ideal quality, and every single good is to show itself not
   merely as per se good, but is also to point to a higher good beyond
   itself. Even as in nature, the good, as a regulated means to an end, is
   associated with a beauty more significant than the mere fitness for an
   end,--even as the flower not merely possesses the fructifying organs
   and the delicate tissues that protect them, but also, in its graceful
   form, its hues and its fragrance, delights man, and, as a symbol of the
   eternally beautiful, reminds him of divine love and of the glory of
   God,--even as the birds of song not only nourish themselves and
   propagate their race, but also praise the goodness of the Creator in
   strains that touch the heart,--even as God not only causes the sun to
   shine and to awaken life, and the clouds to drop rain, but also paints
   on the skies the color-resplendent bow as a pledge of his faithfulness
   and grace,--in a word, as God himself decks his creation with such
   grandeur that the heavens proclaim his glory, and with such beauty that
   the understanding is incapable adequately to comprehend it, but only
   the adoring heart to feel and love it,--so also man, as God-like, not
   only forms that which is useful for the temporal life, but also that
   which, as a significant sign, points to a higher good,--forms reality
   into a type of the true and good,--creates the poetry of reality. Every
   artistic product is such a sign or symbol, but all symbolical forming
   is not properly artistic in the stricter sense, though it is indeed
   poetical. The clothing of man is not simply for a protection against
   the weather, but also largely a suggestive expression of the inner
   life; all adornment as well as cleanliness has a spiritual
   suggestiveness. For him who knows not this symbolical, poetical phase
   of the moral, a very important and essential part of morality remains
   incomprehensible. A large portion of the moral precepts of the
   Scriptures look not to a direct and simple realization of a good, but
   to the expressive suggesting of a moral element not directly contained
   in the matter itself,--have a symbolical character; and lightly to
   esteem this phase of things is an indication of moral obtuseness.
   Doubtless it was not very "useful" when Mary, the sister of Lazarus,
   took a pound of pure and costly ointment and anointed the Lord's feet;
   and the harsh reproof of Judas was perfectly well-grounded from the
   stand-point of mere utilitarianism, but the Lord judged very
   differently from Judas [John xii, 3 sqq.; comp. Mark xiv, 3 sqq.]. To
   this category belong almost all the precepts of the Old Testament in
   regard to the clean and the unclean, to food and clothing,--in which
   case the object of the forming is man himself,--and also in regard to
   the form of worship and whatever is therewith connected, such as
   circumcision, etc., as well as in regard to agriculture [Lev. xix, 19;
   Deut. xxii, 9, 10] and to the treatment of animals [Exod. xxi, 28, 29,
   32; xxiii, 19; Lev. xx, 15, 16].

   The becoming is the outward, beautiful or symbolical form of the
   moral,--in a certain sense its esthetic phase. To celebrate the Lord's
   day in the spiritual-exalting of the heart to God, is a moral duty; to
   give expression to the celebration by sacred art and by a worthy
   outward appearance, is becoming. The ungodly world is prone to
   substitute in the place of the moral substance an outwardly and
   externally gracious form--the becoming; the suggestion: "That is not
   becoming," is with the irreligious world of much more weight than: "It
   is sinful." The outward form may indeed be hypocritically assumed in
   the absence of the substance, but he who holds fast to the moral
   substance, must observe also the form; he only is morally-cultured who
   not only observes the substance of the general precepts, but also aims
   at the morally-becoming; and this is in fact a general and artistic
   forming on the part of the moral activity. The becoming stands not
   along-side of the moral precept, but is essentially contained in it,
   as, in fact, without it man remains coarse and rude. Almost all of the
   above-mentioned precepts of the Old Testament are precepts of the
   becoming, and the New Testament also lays great stress on the becoming
   [1 Cor. xi, 4 sqq.; 1 Tim. ii, 9, and others].

  SECTION CXI.

   Appropriating and forming are, in a right moral development, ever in
   association with each other, and that too all the closer the higher
   their character. No spiritual appropriating is without spiritual
   self-forming, and no forming of an objective entity is without a
   spiritual appropriating of the thing formed; and in fact the forming of
   one's own spirit is per se necessarily an appropriating. The measure of
   appropriating and especially of enjoying stands in all right
   development, always in strict relation to the measure of the forming;
   and the two modes of forming are associated not only with each other,
   but also with the two modes of appropriating, as are in turn the latter
   with each other.

   The fruit of labor and still more the work of art, are the property of
   the laborer and the artist; they call it their own; they have
   appropriated it to themselves in the very process of producing it. The
   outward-directed activity turns thus about and flows back into the
   acting person. In forming an objective entity, man forms his own self;
   he has the work not merely as his own, as a copy of his thought, but he
   is also himself spiritually and morally promoted both by the working
   and by the work. All forming is self-forming; and inasmuch as man
   stands to his fellows in a spiritual relation,--reveals himself to them
   through his culture,--hence all self-forming is directly also in turn a
   forming of others.--All particular forming, all work, should as moral
   include in itself also at the same time an element of general forming;
   without this the laborer falls into spiritual and moral deterioration.
   When the laborer unites the useful with the beautiful,--gives to his
   work a graceful form,--when song accompanies the work, when the heart
   mounts up from the work that serves a temporal end, toward the Eternal
   One, and thus puts into earnest practice the precept: "Pray and labor,"
   then the particular forming is exalted and transfigured by the general.
   The more isolated, the more limited, the work is, so much the more
   preponderates the merely useful phase of it; hence no work is so
   dangerous, nay, so detrimental, to the harmoniously-moral culture of
   man as the spiritless mechanism of factory-work; and white slavery
   works here often much more ruinously than the black. The uninterrupted
   monotony of the narrow routine of the work paralyzes the spirit and
   subverts morality.

   Furthermore, all forming is not only a general appropriating, formative
   of the subject himself, in that he recognizes the product of his
   influence, but also a particular appropriating, in that he enjoys it.
   The divine prototype of this is seen in the account of creation, where
   we read that God looked upon all that he had made, and found that it
   was very good. All moral work, and still more, all general forming,
   are, in and of themselves, also enjoyment, and that too the highest and
   purest enjoyment, even as in the above utterance of the Creator his own
   bliss was implicitly expressed also. But also the sensuous enjoyment
   that is not directly included in the formative activity itself, is
   nevertheless, in virtue of the moral order of the world, associated
   with it. Adam was first to dress and care for the garden, and
   thereafter to eat of its fruits [Gen. ii, 15, 16]. "If any one will not
   work, neither should he eat" [2 Thess. iii, 10]; this is a morally
   unassailable principle; and where the practice is otherwise, there the
   social relations are corrupt; and the grudge of the suffering laborer
   against the luxurious idler has a very just foundation. In proportion
   to the degree of productive activity, rises or falls the moral right to
   enjoyment in general, and to personal position in society. Hence the
   admonition: Let each labor to produce with his own hands something good
   [Eph. iv, 28; comp. Acts xx, 34, 35; 1 Thess. iv, 11; ii, 9].

  SECTION CXII.

   Inasmuch as man becomes perfect only through the perfect all-sided
   development of all his life-phases, and as ally exclusive realization
   and culture of one, or simply some, of them works a disturbance of the
   inner harmony, hence every person should, in so far as his
   circumstances admit of it, realize every form of moral appropriation
   and moral culture. He who allows his life to be devoted exclusively to
   particular forming and appropriating,--to toil and enjoyment, has
   fallen out of moral harmony, and is consequently immoral. General, and
   hence, essentially, religious, forming must attend the work hand in
   hand; and the ordination of the Sabbath along-side of the days of labor
   has not simply a religious, but essentially also a moral significancy.
   Moral resting from labor is a rising to ideal self-culture, an exalting
   of the temporally-particular into the eternal, the holy, the general,
   the divine; the celebrating of the Sabbath is the higher and moral
   transfiguring of the temporal prosaic individual life by the poesy of
   the ideal and the infinite.

   In particular forming man merges himself into objective existence;
   primarily he has not the object in his own possession, but the object
   possesses him; hence the danger, especially in a state of sinfulness,
   that the person lose himself in his labor,--that, as in sensuous
   enjoyment, he passively surrender himself to the creature [Eccles. vi,
   7, in the Hebrew text]. Man should, however, hold fast to himself and
   to his Creator,--should withdraw himself from his absorption in finite
   things, collect himself in spiritual repose,--should obtain fresh moral
   strength for the particular forming of industry, in the general forming
   which springs of enthusiasm. Even as God, though merging himself into
   the world while creating it, yet did not lose and forget himself in it,
   but returned to himself and to his infinite self-sufficiency, and ever
   retains himself in eternal unchangeable majesty above all that is
   created, so also is it a moral requirement that man, in his creating of
   the finite and particular, should not forget himself as a personality
   gifted with eternal destinies; it is for man's sake that the Sabbath
   was made [Mark ii, 27]. It is very suggestive that in the Scriptures
   the repose of God after creation is made the prototype and basis for
   the celebration of the Sabbath [Gen. ii, 3; Exod. xx, 8 sqq. ]. It is
   thereby implied that it is our innermost God-likeness that calls for
   the rest of the Sabbath,--the truly rational, religiously-moral essence
   of man, and not the mere natural need of repose and enjoyment. That
   which is with God only two phases of his eternal life itself, and not
   an alternation in time, namely, creative action and self-possession,
   this falls, in the case of the finite spirit, at least partially, into
   such an alternation,--into labor and Sabbath-rest. God blessed the
   Sabbath day; there rests upon its observance an especial, an
   extraordinary benediction, an impartation of heavenly goods, even as
   the blessing upon labor is primarily only an importation of temporal
   goods. The Sabbath has not merely a negative significancy, is not a
   mere interruption of labor, but it has a very rich positive
   significancy,--it is the giving free scope to the higher,
   time-transcending nature of the rational God-like spirit, the
   re-attaching of the spirit that had been immersed by labor into the
   temporal, to the imperishable and to the divine. Where God is conceived
   of as swallowed up in nature, as with the Chinese and in the unbelief
   of our own day, there exists no Sabbath; there is to be found only a
   discretionary alternation of labor and sensuous enjoyment. The
   celebration of the Sabbath belongs to morality per se, and does not
   depend on the fact of the state of redemption from sinfulness; but
   where sin is as yet a dominant power there its observance is
   necessarily less free, legally more strict, than where the freedom of
   the children of God prevails.

   From the fact that all moral working is attended also with a general
   forming, it follows manifestly that, for him who is truly morally free,
   the antithesis of Sabbath-rest and labor is not of an absolute
   character,--that every day and all labor have also their Sabbath
   consecration, and that, on the other hand, also the Sabbath does not
   absolutely exclude all work. It is perfectly clear, however, that, in
   general, only such works consist with the observance of the Sabbath as
   express a general formative activity,--as bear an artistic character in
   the noblest sense of the word. In this category belong those healings
   of the sick by which the Lord incurred the reproach of
   Sabbath-breaking. Such works are not labor, but, as a restoring of the
   disturbed order of the universe, ate of general and spiritual
   significancy.

SUBDIVISION SECOND.

THE MORAL ACTIVITY IN ITS DIFFERENCES AS RELATING TO ITS DIFFERENT OBJECTS.--I.
IN RELATION TO GOD.

  SECTION CXIII.

   As God sustains to man an essentially active and creative, but not a
   receptive, relation, hence in the strict sense of the word he is an
   object only of moral appropriating.

   (a) The moral appropriating of God is directly at the same time also
   the highest moral self-forming of the moral person, and contains two
   necessarily associated elements: first, that God becomes for us, and
   secondly, that we become for God; that is, that, on the one hand, we
   take up into our moral consciousness the ever present divine, and that,
   on the other, we elevate our moral consciousness to God,--form it into
   the divine life; the former is faith, the latter is worship; neither
   can exist without the other. Believing is the lovingly-willed and
   lovingly-willing, that is, the pious recognizing of God as lovingly
   revealing himself to us as our Lord and our Father, and to whom we are
   obligated to unconditional obedience and submissive love,--it is the
   self-consciousness of man as having come to its rational truth, namely,
   in that man regards himself no more as a mere isolated individual, but
   thinks of himself constantly and strictly in his relations to God.

   As believing is essentially the particular appropriating of God, so the
   knowing, the cognizing of Him is the general appropriating; and hence
   the striving for this knowledge is a high moral duty; this duty is
   fulfilled not without believing, but only through and in virtue of the
   same,--is a spiritual receiving and a true appropriating of the divine
   revelation imparted to us through the channel of faith, in regard to
   the nature, power, and will of God. The correct knowledge of God is not
   the antecedent condition, but the goal of the moral striving, and hence
   without it there can be no perfection of morality.

   God is indeed per se already present in every creature; but in order
   that he shall be truly present for man, that is, in a manner called for
   by his rational nature, it is necessary that man shall freely
   appropriate to himself this presence of God. I possess rationally only
   that which I rationally and morally appropriate. All appropriating, and
   hence all faith, pre-supposes a difference, and at the same time a
   mutual life-relation between its subject and its object; what I already
   am, in and of myself, that I cannot appropriate to myself. That the
   appropriating of God is a moral act, arises from the fact that man may
   fully admit his difference from, and yet not heartily recognize his
   life-relation to, God,--may cling to himself as independent of God, may
   sinfully aspire even to become like God. It is a moral activity when
   man raises his self-consciousness, which is primarily merely
   individual, into a truly rational one, and conceives of himself not
   merely as an isolated being, but as conditioned by God, that is, as
   created by and obligated to God; it is only this religious
   self-consciousness that is moral, and this is in fact faith. Faith is
   not a mere regarding as true, not a mere religious knowledge, or a mere
   objective consciousness, but it is a morally-conditioned believing, a
   willing, and hence a loving, recognition; in faith we will to have God
   and a consciousness of him in us, and we desire this consciousness as
   divine, that is, as a full and true life-force, and hence as operative,
   as realizing the divine. The notion of faith combines, therefore,
   loving and willing with knowing,--is not identical with one of the
   three, but is the unity of them,--is not an affair of the mere
   understanding but of the heart (§ 53). Faith is the thankful reflection
   of the divine love; he who is loved by God, turns himself lovingly
   toward the loving One. Without the love of God to man there would be no
   love of man to God; man believes because he becomes conscious of the
   divine love; he who would only recognize received love, but not
   reciprocated it with his heart, is immoral; a mere recognition of God
   without heart-faith is sinful.

   "Faith is the substance (the sure confidence) of things hoped for, the
   evidence of things not seen" [Heb. xi, 1]; it is not a confidence of
   that which falls within the immediate scope of experience, but of that
   which lies beyond it, not of that which already exists in realization
   but of that which is yet, in virtue of faith, to be realized into fact,
   though indeed it already exists in germ. The really complete
   life-communion with God, the full appropriating of the divine, is at
   first only an object of hope,--can be really brought about only through
   faith; and faith lays hold, in full confidence of success, upon the
   divine as lovingly revealing itself to it. Faith stands, therefore, not
   by the side of knowledge, as if not including this within itself, nor
   yet below it, as if it were but a lower degree thereof, and would cease
   with the increase of knowledge, but in fact above it, inasmuch as it is
   a loving knowing, a lovingly-willed and lovingly-willing knowing of
   God, so that consequently it includes within itself both feeling and
   willing as essential constituent elements. Believing leads to knowing,
   but also precedes actual knowing, and hence is not conditioned thereon.

   As particular appropriating, believing or faith is, so to speak, an
   enjoying of the divine,--belongs essentially to the personality itself,
   and is therefore not communicable, whereas knowing may, on the
   presupposition of faith, be communicated by instruction. In the entire
   sphere of the religious life, believing precedes knowing, for without
   faith God would no more exist for us than would sensuous objects
   without our senses; believing includes, it is true, some degree of
   knowing, but is not per se complete knowing. And for the simple reason
   that believing includes knowing as an essential element, it is a moral
   requirement to bring our knowing to its highest possible perfection,
   and thereby also to heighten and strengthen faith. The divine
   revelation as received by faith becomes real knowledge by a proper
   spiritual merging of ourselves into it, by a full appropriating of its
   contents into our entire spiritually-transformed being, so that the
   knowing becomes thus a powerful moral motive to the loving of God and
   to obedience to his will [Psa. lxiii, 7 sqq.; Jer. xxix, 13, 14; John
   viii, 32; Acts xvii, 27; Col. i, 11; Eph. i, 17, 18]. The knowledge of
   God consists not merely in the, as yet, only imperfectly attainable [1
   Cor. xiii, 9, 10; 2 Cor. v, 7; Isa. lv, 8, 9] knowledge of God's being
   [Rom. i, 19, 20], but also of the divine will as to us [Col. i, 9, 10;
   Eph. v, 15-17] and of the divine providential activity in nature and in
   human life, and of the holy purpose of his world-government. Though
   indeed a proper and ripe knowledge of God leads to a higher perfection
   of the moral life, still knowledge is not, as faith, the antecedent
   condition of the moral in general; for only he can know the truth of
   God who is pure of heart [Matt. v, 8].

  SECTION CXIV.

   The second phase of the moral appropriating of God is, that man becomes
   for God,--that he exalts himself toward God by a moral act in order to
   unite God actually, and not simply in inner recognition, with
   himself,--in order to permit the divine activity to be influential upon
   him; this is in fact the worshiping of God, which is at once a
   religious and a moral, and hence a holy, activity. The worship of God
   is either purely spiritual and at the same time affirmative, namely, in
   that man puts himself spiritually into direct relation with God,--rises
   to God in pious devotion, which is prayer,--or it is of a rather
   virtual and at the same time more negative character, namely, a free
   moral turning away from the ungodly and the unholy,--sacrifice. These
   two phases of the worshiping of God belong inseparably together; there
   is no prayer without sacrifice, and no sacrifice without prayer.

   Faith is the purely inward phase of the moral appropriating of the
   divine,--the woman-like self-opening of the soul for the in-shining of
   the divine light; in this receiving, the person remains strictly in and
   with himself. Worshiping is more objective; the person goes forth out
   of himself,--lets his own light beam forth toward the divine original
   light, even as the flame of the sacrifice, when once kindled by the
   heavenly fire, mounts up toward heaven again. All worshiping of God
   presupposes faith, though it is itself more than faith. When man has by
   faith received the divine into himself, and imbued himself therewith,
   he still yet distinguishes himself as a creature from God,--puts
   himself into moral relation to God, raises himself by a moral action to
   God as to one different from himself; and this is the worshiping of
   God. To the pure mystic all worship falls away, for he loses sight of
   the distinction between the Infinite and the finite.

   Worship is the immediate actual outgoing of faith; it is a religious
   activity which aims at making the already naturally-existing communion
   of God with us into a consciously-willed communion of ourselves with
   God; it is a sacred activity as distinguished from the worldly or
   profane,--from that which deals only with temporal things. In a normal
   moral condition of humanity, all activity whatever would bear a sacred
   character, and the distinction between the sacred and the "profane"
   could only assume the form of a conditional outward difference of a
   temporally-alternating occupation with earthly things, on the one hand,
   and with eternal interests on the other; with labor and with the
   Sabbath-rest of the soul during the continuance of the earthly life,
   and that, too, only in so far as consistent with the fact that all
   earthly occupation is constantly exalted and sanctified by a positive
   and conscious relation to the eternal. Our sacred activity relates
   either immediately to God,--is a purely affirmative uniting of the
   human to the divine; or it relates only mediately to God, but
   immediately to the ungodly, namely, in that by refusing the ungodly, it
   sets up a barrier against it,--turns the heart away from the evil, and
   toward God. These two features can never be separated; prayer without
   sacrifice, without a rejecting of the ungodly both within and without
   us, is morally impossible; in exalting ourselves to God in prayer we at
   the same time distinguish the divine from the anti-divine, and withdraw
   ourselves from the latter; we cannot truly pray without at the same
   time renouncing the worldly,--without giving up, without sacrificing,
   the pretentious emptiness of finite things.

  SECTION CXV.

   1. Prayer, as resting on faith in the personal God, is the free moral
   uniting of the believing heart with God, in such a manner that the
   moral personality is in fact not lost, but, on the contrary, exalted in
   and by God; it is the free and conscious recognizing that God knows all
   our thoughts, and the joyful wish that such be the case; it exalts our
   natural communion with God into a spiritual and moral one, the being of
   God in man into a being of man in God. As it is alone in this being at
   one with God that the true life of the rational spirit consists, hence
   in the moral man, at least a prayerful disposition, if not express
   praying in words, must be strictly unceasing. Prayer has only then
   moral worth when it really springs of a praying heart, and hence, when
   it is offered with devotion; and as it unites the person with the
   Father of all men, hence it leads to a communion of prayer, and the
   higher form of prayer is therefore social prayer.

   In prayer man enters into personal communion with God, and in loving
   confidence expressly communicates to him as the All-knowing One, his
   pious thinking, feeling, and willing; only that which is pious can be
   communicated to God; a consciously unpious prayer is blasphemy. Prayer
   is absolutely conditioned on a believing recognition of the divine
   omniscience; it is not, therefore, so much a means of making our
   thoughts known to God,--for God knows our thoughts from afar, and of
   what we have need before we ask therefor,--as rather an expression of
   our belief that God knows, and our joyful willingness that he should
   know thereof. A prayer that should spring from the thought that God
   himself needed it in order to know our inward state, would be per se
   impious and in self-contradiction; but every thought and every act that
   we are not willing that God should know, and that we would hide from
   him, is impious, and the degree of our piety is measured by the degree
   in which we have the desire that all our acts and thoughts should be
   known of God. The intermission of prayer does not shut out our inner
   life from the divine knowledge, it simply shuts out the divine blessing
   from us. Prayer reveals not our being to the divine knowledge, but it
   reveals the divine all-knowing presence to us,--brings not God down to
   us, but elevates us to God; it is for us the means of uniting ourselves
   truly with God, inasmuch as thereby not only is God, as the Omnipresent
   One, with us, but also we, by a religiously-moral act of will, are with
   God; and only when God is himself with us, not merely naturally and
   without our desire, but upon our express prayer and seeking therefor,
   are we in real saving life-communion with him. Without prayer there can
   be only a natural, but not a moral and spiritual communion with God;
   and this merely natural communion is, on the supposition that it rises
   no higher, in antagonism to the essence of a moral creature, and hence
   leads to the casting off of man by God. For him who cannot pray, God's
   presence is judicial and condemnatory. As in prayer man exalts himself
   to the highest object of the moral activity, so is prayer also the
   highest moral act; and all other moral action receives its moral worth
   solely from its relation to this,--solely as morally consecrated by
   prayer.

   In prayer, man gives utterance to his highest moral privileges and to
   his free personality, inasmuch as thereby, with full and joyful
   freedom, he wills, recognizes and heightens that which already existed
   without prayer, though indeed only in an immediate, natural ante-moral
   manner, but which could not so remain without turning into antagonism
   and unblessedness, namely, the divine omnipresent domination. Only to
   those who desire it is God's presence a blessing, and only by those who
   love is the loving communion of God experienced; "draw nigh to God, and
   he will draw nigh to you" [James iv, 8; comp. Psa. cxlv, 18, 19]. It is
   the sublime significancy of prayer that it brings into prominence man's
   great and high destination, that it brings to expression his free
   personal relation to God, that it heightens man's consciousness of his
   true moral nature in relation to God; and as all morality depends on
   our relation to God, prayer is, in fact, the very life-blood of
   morality. The true freedom, and hence also the true morality of man,
   manifests itself not in his arbitrarily choosing that which is fleeting
   or baseless, but in the fact that with conscious free-will and glad
   assent he recognizes and confirms that which lies in the holy
   constitution of the world itself. To the limited natural understanding,
   prayer seems useless and therefore irrational; for this understanding
   is not capable of comprehending the spiritual. It is true, God causes
   his sun to rise upon the good and the evil, gives rain to the just and
   the unjust, furnishes food to man and beast,--in a word, He "gives to
   all men their daily bread" even without prayer; but the significancy of
   such prayer is the fact of our recognizing Him as the Giver of all, of
   our receiving his gifts with thankfulness. That God's presence and
   gifts be not only about us but also for us, that they become a blessing
   to us, a bond of love between God and us, a living fountain of
   godly-mindedness,--that they be not foreign to us, not in antagonism to
   us, but in fact our own and in harmony with us,--that God's being in us
   be also our being in God,--all this is the fruit of prayer.

   Prayer is so intimately connected with the morally-religious life that
   it appears, under some form, even among those nations where, because of
   the relative ignoring of the personality of God, it has almost lost all
   shadow of meaning, as, for example, in India. Greek and Roman
   philosophers often introduce their disquisitions with prayers
   (Socrates, Plato); the Romans prayed on occasion of all important
   state-events, on the election of magistrates, the enactment of laws,
   etc. Of course in heathen prayer there could never exist the proper
   earnestness, inasmuch as the idea of God was always imperfect; no
   heathen could ever pray as could a pious Israelite. The first real
   opposing of prayer, if we except the frivolous Epicureans, was on the
   part of Maximus of Tyre, a Platonist of the second century after
   Christ; it was also opposed by Rousseau, though for very superficial
   reasons (because the order of the universe could not be changed by
   individual wishes), and, with astonishing lack of insight by Kant, who
   even finds in the Lord's Prayer, as given by Christ, a very clear
   suggestion to substitute in the place of all prayer simply a
   determination to lead a good life (Relig. innerh., etc., 1794, p. 302).
   In Pantheism the rejection of prayer as absurd, is a matter of
   course.--The Scriptures present prayer as one of the most essential
   moral requirements [Psa. cxlv, 18, 19; Matt. vii, 7; Mark xi, 24; James
   i, 5 sqq.; 1 Tim. ii, 1-3; Eph vi, 18]. The injunction to pray without
   ceasing [Luke xviii, 1-7; 1 Thess. v, 17; Rom. xii, 12; Col. iv, 2; 1
   Tim. ii, 8; comp. Psa. lxiii, 7] implies the constant aspiring of our
   heart to God as to Him whose will alone is our law, and who gives his
   blessing to whatever is done in his name.--Where sin is not yet
   dominant, any other than a devotional prayer is inconceivable. Devotion
   in prayer is not merely the absence of distraction, but it is the
   praying out of a true, earnest and upright heart-disposition. Devotion
   cannot be required as a special duty, for it is necessarily included in
   the very idea of prayer; the Scriptures simply allude to the
   earnestness of prayer, and to the liability of self-deception in
   well-meant prayer [Isa. xxix, 13; Psa. cxlv, 18; Matt. xv, 8; vi, 5-7;
   James v, 16].

   It is not as a merely moral, but as a religious, activity that prayer
   leads to communion, for religion is essentially socializing, not
   directly, however, but in virtue of the communion which it establishes
   with God. Mere individual prayer has its proper justification as
   bearing on the personal relation to God; it is in fact the primary and
   most obvious form [Matt. vi, 6]; but prayer attains to its highest,
   though never exclusive, character as the single-hearted prayer of the
   believing communion or church-society. And this not simply because such
   prayer hightens the feeling of the unitedness of the faithful, but
   because, in virtue of the throwing off of personal isolation and of its
   flowing out of the holy spirit which pervades the society, it has a
   guarantee of greater purity, and consequently the promise of special
   blessing [Matt. xviii, 20; Acts ii, 42; Eph. v, 19; Col. iii,
   16].--Christ himself gives the moral pattern of prayer; he prayed out
   of the full consciousness of life-communion with God, and consequently
   with full confidence of being answered [Heb. v, 7]; he prayed often in
   solitude [Matt. xiv, 23; xxvi, 36, 42; Mark vi, 32; Luke vi, 12; ix,
   28], and often in the presence of others [Matt. xxvi, 39; John xi, 41
   sqq.], and in communion with his disciples [John xvii, 1 sqq.].

  SECTION CXVI.

   All prayer is primarily, either expressly or in virtue of its necessary
   presuppositions, a confession, a recognition of God as the
   unconditional Lord, and as the all-knowing, all powerful and all-loving
   Father. In as far as in it we are always conscious of ourselves as
   loved by God, prayer is at the same time also thanksgiving. In so far
   as in prayer we have respect not only to the past and present, but also
   to the goal of moral effort, the realization of which we regard as not
   in our own power independently of God, nor yet in an unfree
   nature-necessity, but in the will of God as co-operating with us,
   prayer becomes petition--the climax of the inner religiously-moral
   life, wherein the true filial relation of man to God finds its
   expression; and as the moral end is of a rational, and hence not merely
   individual, character, consequently the petition is essentially also
   intercession--the highest religious expression of our love to man. As
   only the all-embracing wisdom of God is capable of fully seeing the
   appropriateness of earthly things and relations to the attainment of
   the highest good, hence the petition for earthly goods, though per se
   entirely legitimate, can never be more than of a humbly conditional
   character; and there is no petition other than that for the per se
   unquestionably eternal good, that has no other condition than the
   willing, believing obedience of the subject. The promise of answering
   is based on the condition of believing and of humble confidence.

   Prayer is per se a recognition of God,--it is adoration and confession
   both to God as the all-ruling One, and also before God as the
   all-knowing and holy One. In this recognizing confession itself, there
   is involved a thanksgiving, which consequently is included, though it
   may be but implicitly, in every prayer; in the Lord's Prayer it lies in
   the very address. All thanksgiving [1 Sam. ii; Psa. cvi, 1; Rom. xv, 6;
   1 Tim. iv, 4, 5; Phil. iv, 6; Col. iii, 17; iv, 2] is at the same time
   a petition for the bestowal of the good for which it is offered; and
   the petition is, in virtue of the soul-uniting filial relation to God,
   necessarily also intercession for others and for the whole kingdom of
   God [Matt. vi, 10; John xvii, 9 sqq.; Eph i, 16; vi, 18; 1 Tim. ii,
   1-3; Col. i, 9; iv, 3; Phil. i, 4; James v, 16; Heb. xiii, 18]. So long
   as prayer remains of a merely individual character, it comes short of
   true prayer,--rests not yet on a consciousness of the filial relation
   to God, for this consciousness is inconsistent with self-seeking
   exclusiveness; the children of God have their home only in the kingdom
   of God.

   Prayer as petition is the profoundest enigma for the merely wordly
   finitely-occupied understanding; for the religious heart, however, it
   is the beginning and the center of the spiritual life. He who cannot
   offer petitions to God is not of God. All intellectual doubts as to the
   nature and efficacy of petitioning prayer, have as their back-ground a
   doubt of the personality of God, although they may assume to be a
   vindication of the eternal order of the world. A God who cannot answer
   petitions is not a personal spirit, but only an unconscious
   nature-force. In the believing petition the Scriptures promise answers
   [Psa. 1, 15; x, 17; xxii, 4, 5; xxxiv, 15; lxii, 1 sqq.; lxv, 2; xciv,
   9; cii, 17; cxlv, 18, 19; Prov. xv, 8; Isa. lxv, 24; Matt. vii, 7;
   xviii, 19; xxi, 22; John ix, 31; xvi, 23, 24; 1 John iii, 22; v, 14;
   James i, 5; iv, 8; v, 13-18; 1 Pet. iii, 12]; to the impious and
   foolish petition they refuse it [Job xxvii, 9; xxxv, 13; Psa. lxvi, 18;
   Prov. xv, 8, 29; xxviii, 9; Isa. i, 15; John ix, 31; James iv, 3, and
   others]; and confident faith in an answer is itself the condition of
   the answer [Mark xi, 24; James i, 6, 7]. As the fuller development of
   the subject belongs to dogmatics, we here subjoin but a few general
   observations. The answering of prayer is not unconditional; it is
   conditioned, on the one hand, on the loving wisdom of God, which is
   higher than that of man [Eph. iii, 20], and, on the other, on the
   prayer-spirit of him who prays. And the answer is not a merely seeming
   one, so that prayer would be superfluous, but the answer is given on
   the basis and in virtue of the prayer [Luke xi, 5-13; xviii, 1
   sqq.,--the lesson of which is, that if earnest prayer is effectual even
   with unloving men, how much more is it so with the all-loving One who
   gladly hears such petitions; Gen. xviii, 23 sqq.; Exod. xxxii, 9 sqq.;
   Num. xiv, 13 sqq., 20; xvi, 20 sqq.; Isa. xxxviii]. Prayer does not
   change the eternal counsel of God; this counsel is itself not
   unconditional, but it is determined by the all-knowing One in view of
   the free conduct of his creatures; and, consequently, one element of it
   is, that prayer is eternally destined to be answered. Every pious
   prayer is answered, although only in the manner most wholesome to him
   who offers it, and hence not always in the special manner in which the
   answer is expected [2 Cor. xii, 8, 9.] If man deceives himself as to
   the sought good, still he receives the good,--not, however, the false
   one which he had in mind, but the true one which he had in heart. Hence
   no believing prayer, in so far as it relates to earthly goods, can be
   or should be more than a conditional petition, and the manner of the
   fulfillment must be submitted to the wisdom of God. If even Christ
   prays in this conditional manner to the Father [Matt. xxvi, 39, 42;
   Luke xxii, 42], by how much more should man so pray, whose knowledge is
   so limited; true faith is in fact a confidence that God knows best what
   serves for our peace, and brings it about; childlikeness and humble
   confidence give power and truth to prayer [Rom. viii, 15; Gal. iv, 6].
   Under this condition, prayer for particular earthly goods is not only
   allowed to man, but is also willed by God and with promise of answering
   [Matt. vi, 11; vii, 7 sqq.; Phil. iv, 5, 6; Eph. vi, 18; James v, 14
   sqq.]; and the confidence of obtaining the object sought, even in such
   special petitions rises to confident assurance wherever the prayer goes
   forth from a complete life-communion with God, and in the, power of the
   Holy Ghost,--wherever it is prayer "in spirit and in truth" [John iv,
   24; Rom. viii, 26, 27; Gal. iv, 6; Eph. vi, 18; comp. John xiv, 13;
   xvi, 23]; for, the more complete the union of the pious heart with God,
   so much the more does it partake of the illuminating power of God, and
   God's knowledge of the future begets in him who partakes of God's
   Spirit a presentiment of the divine counsel in regard to him; and the
   presentiment rises to a prayerful longing, an unshaken faith; and the
   true petition to a prophecy. The fulfillment of the petition is felt by
   anticipation in the prayer itself; he who truly prays is a prophet; and
   God is the fulfiller of the prophecy, because he is the author of the
   counsel. Here also Christ himself furnishes the pattern: "Father, I
   thank thee that thou hast heard me," etc. [John xi, 41]; his prayer
   related to what he had already prophetically beholden and predicted
   [verses 11, 23]. The primary and most essential element of true prayer
   is, of course, the petition for the filial relation to God and for the
   coming of the kingdom of God [Matt. vi, 10, 12; John xvii, 15; Luke xi,
   13]. Man should beware, however, of sinning in prayer itself; but by
   self-seeking narrowness he does this; to pray in the spirit of God, is
   to pray for the kingdom of God. Model prayers are the Lord's Prayer and
   the high-priestly prayer of Christ.

   As God's eternal decree to answer prayer is conditioned on the
   actuality of the prayer, hence prayer is not simply moral
   appropriation, but also, though not in a direct and strict sense, moral
   forming, seeing that, though indeed not God himself, yet in fact the
   particular temporal manifestation of his world-government, is
   conditioned on prayer. God's essence is indeed not subject to change;
   his doing and acting in the world, however, are, in virtue of his
   righteous love, conditioned on the free conduct of his rational
   creatures, and hence also on prayer. The real forming, however, which
   is directly connected with prayer relates to the personal
   religiously-moral being of the subject. The blessing efficacy of prayer
   beams back from God upon the offerer, namely, in that in virtue of the
   prayer not only his being in God comes more vividly to his
   consciousness, and has a more efficacious influence, but also God's
   being in him comes to a higher reality. Faith in prayer and in the
   answering of prayer, heighten the divine life of the children of God.

  SECTION CXVII.

   2. The negating and rather virtual phase of the service of God, is the
   actual or symbolical manifesting of the real or conditional vanity of
   earthly things and relations, as contrasted with God or with the
   God-loving, pious state of the heart, namely, in sacrifice, the essence
   of which is self-denial or renunciation. In the unfallen state of man
   sacrifice consists essentially simply in a free giving-up of that which
   is naturally pleasurable, out of regard to the divine will and far the
   sake of the higher good, the moral end; hence it consists in the
   subordinating and giving up of earthly desire. The appropriating of the
   divine requires the rejection of all that is ungodly, and therein the
   person accomplishes, at the same time, a high moral culture of himself.

   As contrasted with the highest good and with God, every thing finite
   appears as relatively empty and void; the actual manifesting of this
   nullity, out of love to the divine, is sacrifice,--a notion that is
   fundamental to all religions, and that constitutes the focal point of
   all religious life, and which is still recognizable even in the most
   utter perversions of the truth. [13] There is no love without
   sacrifice; the higher the love, so much the higher the readiness to
   sacrifice for the sake of the beloved; sacrifice is the test of love;
   maternal love sacrifices repose and enjoyment for the sake of the
   child; this is not figurative language,--the sacrifice is real and
   true. As God's highest love expresses itself in the giving up of his
   Son, so man's love to God is manifested in the sacrificing of that to
   the enjoyment of which man has in general a right. As, however, in the
   sinless state of humanity, there would exist no really untrue and vain
   object from which man would have actually to turn away in moral
   abhorrence, but only a merely relatively such, namely, the merely
   natural and transitory as in contradistinction to the spiritual, hence
   in this case sacrifice would not consist in the destruction of an
   entity, but in the renunciation of an enjoyment, an abstaining from the
   merely worldly. In the interest of his spiritual freedom, of his moral
   growth, man is not to give himself over to nature, but must by
   obedience renounce some degree of the enjoyment of nature and of his
   personal discretion. He is to sacrifice whatever tempts him from God,
   whatever binds him to the merely natural or to the non-divine; also of
   unfallen man it was required that he should realize his spiritual
   freedom by the free renunciation of a merely natural enjoyment.
   Christ's fasting in the wilderness was not a part of his atoning
   self-sacrifice, and yet it was a sacrifice on the part of the Son of
   man, even as was also required of unfallen man. In yielding himself to
   enjoyment without moral discrimination, man loses hold on the
   spiritual; lie must renounce in order to be free. In the unfallen state
   sacrifice has essentially an educative end and a symbolical form. God
   certainly did not forbid man to eat of the designated tree because it
   was a bad tree, for to sinless beings there could be nothing evil in
   the entire circle of God-made nature; but in his educative wisdom, God
   required of man a sacrifice, for the simple reason that no moral life
   is possible without self-restraint, no religious life without
   sacrifice. Man stands in the presence of nature and God, both are good;
   but nature is a created object and may not be placed on an equal
   footing with God. When man enjoys nature for its own sake and without
   reference to God, he sins; for he ought to belong, not to nature, but
   to God. Hence he should recognize, and manifest in moral acts, the
   truth that nature per se is not the true being and the true goal of
   moral aspiration, namely, the highest good, but only a means to this
   end. Hence his moral relation to nature and to the sensuous, is, as in
   contrast to his relation to God, of a negative character. This "no" in
   regard to nature, man pronounces morally when he subordinates his
   relation to nature to his higher relation to God, when he says to
   sensuous desire: "Thou mayest not, shalt not absorb and dominate my
   thinking and willing;" he must freely hold in check the merely
   sensuous, for the sake of the spiritual,--must restrain himself from
   the former in order that he may possess and perfect himself as a moral
   spirit, and that he may rise to spiritual-mindedness.

   It is the antagonism of the spirit to the flesh that lies at the basis
   of sacrifice; in the interest of the spiritual, the spirit sacrifices
   the fleshly. Also man as normal and not yet sinful, had to crucify his
   flesh with the affections and lusts thereof [Gal. v, 24], although this
   flesh and its desires were not yet immoral; but to have sought the
   flesh as an end, as a good, would have been sinful; and God put upon
   him a requirement of abnegation in order that he might recognize and
   actually learn this fact,--that he might break away from the merely
   sensuous, and develop in himself the image of God. Simple obedience to
   this requirement, without a why or wherefore, was the purest and best
   of sacrifices. This Paradisaical germ of all sacrifice is, therefore,
   self-denial in obedience to God, a renouncing not a destroying, a
   giving up, out of love to the spirit, of that which is dear to the
   flesh; and this idea pervades all forms of sacrifice, even the emphatic
   sin-offering; only that which is dear to man can be to him a sacrifice;
   and because of the simple fact that the first man would not bring the
   light sacrifice required of him, it became necessary for him afterward
   to make severer ones; and from the hour of the fall and thenceforth the
   morally-religious consciousness of humanity finds satisfaction only in
   a series of progressively more violent and more terrible sacrifices,
   culminating in the offering of human victims, and that too not merely
   among the rude, but even among the most civilized of gentile nations.

   In the idea of sacrifice it is always implied that that which the
   person gives up is per se good and right, that primarily lie has a
   right to its enjoyment, but that he gives it up for the sake of a
   higher end; to give up that which is per se bad, is not to sacrifice;
   the offering that was presented to Jehovah had to be pure and spotless;
   and the worth of the sacrifice rises with the worth of the object
   offered. Thus, sensuous enjoyment is per se good, but it must be
   restrained and limited, and often refused, in order that not it but the
   rational spirit may be the master. But man has also to bring, in the
   interest of the moral, purely spiritual sacrifices. It was not the
   sensuous per se that was the temptation to Eve, but the representation
   made to her that the tree would render her "wise;" it was her duty, as
   it is the duty of man in general, to renounce the desire of obtaining
   from the creature that wisdom which only God can impart--which can be
   learned only in believing obedience to God.

   The sacrifice that was required of unfallen man implied in its
   renunciation at the same time, a confession, namely, to God as the
   highest good and the highest love, and this again implied thankfulness
   for the love received in communion with God. Inasmuch as every good
   gift is from God hence the thank-offering of the believer can only be
   symbolical, expressive of his readiness to give up in the interest of
   the eternal even that which is dearest of all to him, in the
   consciousness that in the communion with God for whom it is given up,
   the real and true life is in fact preserved; in the presence of God
   none is to appear empty [Exod. xxiii, 15; xxxiv, 20].

   Sacrifice appears in the Old Testament in its more definite form as
   early as in the case of Cain and Abel; we find no indication of its
   express institution by God; and we might therefore regard it as an
   immediate and natural expression of the religious consciousness;
   however, a positive divine prescription is the more probable. It is
   certainly not probable that sacrifice was first made from a
   consciousness of guilt; the offerings of Cain and Abel, consisting of
   the products of the field and of the flock, seem rather to be
   thank-offerings than sin-offerings; Abel's bloody offering is expressly
   designated [Gen. iv, 4] by the word minchah (present, gift) by which
   are subsequently designated the bloodless thank-offerings in
   contradistinction to the bloody, and, for the most part, atoning
   offerings, namely, the sebachim; the offering of Noah appears expressly
   as a thank-offering [viii, 20] The burning up of the material of the
   sacrifice signifies the renunciation and the eradication of the earthly
   desires of him who sacrifices; the pure heavenward-mounting sacrificial
   flame symbolizes the exaltation of the heart from the earthly to the
   heavenly,--the union with God. Thus sacrifice becomes a symbol of the
   alliance of man with God; and in the case of Noah and the patriarchs, a
   sign of the Covenant, and hence also a sign of the union of the
   Israelites who escaped from Egypt, into one people [Exod. iii, 12].
   And, therefore, subsequently in the fully-developed sacrificial service
   of a sinful people, the essence of the sacrifice was in fact not placed
   in the outward rite, but in the submission of the heart, in the
   renunciation of an earthly self-seeking mind, in the complete giving up
   of all earthly love for God's sake [Gen. xxii, 16]; obedience is better
   than [outward] sacrifice; God-pleasing sacrifices are a broken spirit
   and a contrite heart, and "to do justice and judgment is more
   acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice" [1 Sam. xv, 22; Psa. xl, 6; 1,
   8-15; li, 16, 17, 18; Hos. vi, 6; Eccl. iv, 17; Prov. xxi, 3, 27; Isa.
   i, 11; Jer. vi, 20; comp. Matt. ix, 13; xii, 7; Mark xii, 33]. In the
   case of the very first sacrifices God warns man against the error of
   supposing that the essence of the sacrifice lies in the outward act;
   Abel's offering He graciously accepts, that of Cain He disregards.
   Sacrifice is an appropriating of the divine, inasmuch as in the turning
   away from the non-divine there is necessarily implied a turning to the
   divine.

  SECTION CXVIII.

   The moral sparing of the divine, has direct reference not to God
   himself; but to the forms under which He is revealed. Every thing
   whereby God becomes for us is sacred as distinguished from merely
   created objects per se. In the unfallen state of humanity all created
   objects are at the same time also sacred, namely, in so far as they are
   considered an expression of the divine will; and whatever is sacred is
   in the highest degree an object of moral sparing,--should be treated as
   sacred. This sparing springs from moral humility,--is an express
   respecting of the sacred in virtue of a holy awe, springing from a
   lively consciousness, on the one hand, of the divine glory even in the
   humbler forms of its manifestation, and, on the other, of our own
   existence as a limited one and as resting solely on divine grace. The
   objects of this sacred awe, and hence of moral sparing, are both the
   immediate, full and actual self-revelations of God, and also all
   mediating instrumentalities of His revelation and communication, as
   well as also every thing that relates to the reverencing of God on the
   part of man.

   The distinction between the sacred and the non-sacred is, for the
   unfallen state, of a merely conditional character; it is in fact,
   simply the same thing considered under two phases; in all things we can
   behold both the created and the Creator. He who is truly pious sees
   himself every-where surrounded by the sacred,--he prays to God not
   merely in the temple of Jerusalem, or on Mount Gerizim, but every-where
   in spirit and in truth. Now, in so far as objects that are imbued with
   the divine are temporal and finite, they are capable of being abused
   and desecrated,--hence the moral duty of sparing. The direction of God
   to Moses on occasion of the revelation in the burning bush [Exod. iii,
   5], suggests the proper moral bearing of man; he must put away from
   himself all that bears upon itself the character of the common, the
   unholy, the dross of earth. The duty of sparing, as relating to the
   sacred, is not. a mere non-doing, but, like every other form of this
   duty, it is a self-restraining out of regard to the higher right of the
   sacred object; a sparing from mere indifference would be sinful.

   The objects of this sparing are: (1) The immediate personal revelations
   of God himself. Here there is no room for a mere passive bearing; here
   the mere non-doing, the mere not respecting the divine presence, is an
   offending of God himself; and moral sparing passes over at once into
   adoring reverence; here the declaration of Christ holds good: "He that
   is not for me is against me;" the not-concerning ourselves about God is
   a dishonoring of God.--(2) God's revelation and self-communication
   through his Word should be recognized as absolutely sacred, and
   distinguished in every respect from whatever is merely human and
   natural; it is disesteemed and dishonored by doubt, unbelief, and
   disobedience, and by trifling or irreverent use, by ridicule or
   neglect; the divine Word as sacred is to be treated entirely
   differently from the merely human; it calls for unconditional faith and
   reverent submission.--(3) The name of God [Exod. iii, 14] and other
   symbolical designations of God must be treated with sacred awe and
   sparing,--may not be associated with the common and thus subjected to
   irreverent use, may not be misused in sport, or frivolity, or for
   deception [Exod. xx, 7; Lev. xix, 12; xxii, 32; Matt. vi, 9]. A name is
   not a mere empty sound; it is the body of a thought; and as the human
   body is not an object of indifference for the spirit, and as to
   dishonor it is to insult the spirit, so also is a misusing of the
   divine name a dishonoring of God himself. In the awe of the Jews as to
   the pronouncing of the name of Jehovah, there lay a deep moral
   significancy, though indeed this peculiarity rendered also possible an
   outward evasion of the command itself. That the precept to revere God's
   name appears as one of the chief commandments of the Mosaic law,
   evinces its high moral importance. Where there exists reverential love,
   there the name of the beloved will not be desecrated by triflingness
   and frivolous sport. And what is true of the name is also true of all
   symbols of God, as, for example, in the Ancient Covenant, of the
   covering of the ark of the Covenant (the mercy-seat), of the pillar of
   fire, etc. In a more general sense every form of sin is a dishonoring
   of the name and image of God, inasmuch as man himself bears God's name
   and image in himself, and should therefore spare and respect these in
   his own person [comp. Rom. ii, 24]; and all morality may be summed up
   in the keeping sacred of the divine image in ourselves,--as expressed
   by Jehovah: "Ye shall sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am holy"
   [Lev. xi, 44], or in the words of Peter: "Sanctify the Lord God in your
   hearts" [1 Pet. iii, 15].--(4) The human organs of divine revelation,
   the prophets and the called heralds of the divine Word in general, have
   a moral right to reverential sparing, though this sparing refers
   essentially not to them as men, but to God in whose name they speak.
   [Psa. cv, 15; Matt. x, 40, 41; comp. xi, 49-51; 1 Thes. v, 12, 13; Heb.
   xiii, 17]; the persecuting and killing of the prophets is frequently
   spoken of in Scripture as among the most heinous of offenses. Also in a
   sinless development of humanity all those would be regarded in the
   light of prophets of God, who, having attained to higher spiritual
   knowledge, should bear witness of divine truth; they would stand not
   strictly on an equal footing with those whom they should teach and
   train; and their recognition as divine messengers would beget a greater
   willingness to give heed to them. Wherever there is a really moral
   communion, there the ministers of God are honored; not to respect them
   is a sign of deep moral declension; but the deepest degradation of all
   is where they themselves do not respect their calling. No prophet of
   God was ever without moral self-denial and constant humiliation before
   God,--without the deeply felt consciousness of Moses: "Who am I that I
   should go unto Pharaoh, and bring forth the children of Israel out of
   Egypt?"--but also no prophet of God was ever without the sacred right
   to be recognized and respected as God's messenger, provided only that
   he be found faithful.--(5) All that relates to the worshiping of
   God,--the holy seasons, places, and things, are, as sacred, to be
   distinguished from the non-sacred, and to be honored accordingly, and
   not to be placed on an equal footing with that which serves only
   temporal, individual ends. The Sabbath is to be treated quite otherwise
   than the day of labor; it has a right to be respected, for it is God's
   day, set apart to his special service. Its celebration by actual divine
   worship is only one of its phases, the other is its being sacredly
   spared. Every thing is to be avoided on the Sabbath which disturbs the
   devout frame of the soul,--attracts it back to the merely earthly and
   sensuous, impresses upon it a mere every-day character. lie who does
   not honor the day of the Lord, honors also not the Lord of the day.
   Holy places and things, being consecrated to heavenly purposes, should
   not be profaned to worldly entertainment and to merely temporal uses.
   Though we do not recognize any mystic power in a special consecration,
   yet we hold fast to the principle that holy places and things belong
   exclusively to the service of the Lord. God himself ordained, in the
   Old Testament, particular sacred things and a special consecration of
   them [Exod. xxv, sqq.; xxx, 22 sqq.]. Even as the "burning bush" [Exod.
   iii, 5] and the mount of legislation and the holy of holies in the
   temple were separated from all that was not sacred, so also is it with
   every place that is dedicated to the holy One [Lev. xix, 30]. The
   significancy of this setting apart, and the importance of this
   respecting of the sacred, increase with the actuality of sin.

   Note. God cannot of course be an object of moral forming in the strict
   sense of the word. Though prayer is in fact a moral influencing of God,
   inasmuch as it finds hearing, still no change is thereby wrought in
   God, and that which is realized by the efficacy of prayer is not so
   much in God as in us and in the world. But in a remote sense we may
   speak of a forming of the divine, namely, in so far as God is expressed
   in sacred symbols and in sacred art, and in so far as, by our
   witnessings for God, the knowledge and love of God are implanted in the
   souls of men; all this, however, is in reality simply a forming of the
   finite and the human into an image of God, and not a forming of God
   himself.

II. THE MORAL ACTIVITY, IN RELATION TO THE MORAL PERSON HIMSELF.

  SECTION CXIX.

   (a) The duty of moral sparing is here the preserving of one's own
   existence and of its normal peculiarity and development, as prompted by
   a consciousness of the divine will, and hence also the warding off of
   all therewith-conflicting and disturbing or destroying influences on
   the part of nature or of the spiritual world. To this end it is
   necessary that in all things the true relation of the body, as a
   serving power, to the rational spirit, as the dominating power, be
   preserved, and that the image of God, which though originally inherent
   in man. is yet in need of fuller development, be preserved pure even in
   its corporeally-symbolical manifestation.

   The moral sparing of one's self is the higher moral application of a
   law that pervades the entire totality of being. That which is cohesion
   in a nature-body, and the law of gravitation in the natural world in
   general, and the instinct of self-defense and of self-preservation in
   the animal world, becomes with man a moral duty. When man seeks to
   preserve himself, to ward off injury and death, out of mere natural
   instinct, his action is not yet moral; it becomes moral only when it
   springs from a consciousness that it is God's will,--that God has
   pleasure in our existence as his own creative work, that He has a
   purpose in us which we are morally to fulfill. Of a duty of
   self-destruction there can never be any possibility; and for a duty of
   entire self-sacrifice, of the giving up of life for the sake of a
   higher end, there is, in a state of sinlessness, also no possibility;
   otherwise the divine government would be in anarchy. God who gave
   existence to man wills also its preservation,--has willed it as a moral
   end, and not simply as a means to an end. Death is simply the wages of
   sin, and not a condition of virtue, save alone where on account of sin
   there is need of a sacrifice.

   In a sinless state the duty of self-sparing is of easy fulfillment,
   partly for the reason that it corresponds to a natural law immanent in
   all living creatures, and partly because disturbing influences are
   conceivable only where they are occasioned by the fault of man
   himself,--for example, when he presumptuously exposes himself to such
   natural influences as he is not yet able to resist,--which is in fact
   possible seeing that, also for the unfallen state, the complete mastery
   over nature is presented as a condition yet to be attained to by moral
   effort. Also from the influence of spiritual beings an injuring of the
   moral person is possible, so long as the rational creature has not as
   yet attained to its ultimate perfection, so that here also there is
   place for the duty of watchfulness, in order that the diverse
   personalities that are as yet in process of development may not act
   hinderingly upon each other. And this duty of sparing watchfulness is
   still more increased when the moral person stands no longer in the
   presence of simply sin-free beings, but is assaulted by spiritual
   temptation, as in the case of Adam and Eve; here the duty of
   self-preserving sparing assumes at once the form of a positive warding
   off.--In the Scriptures the duty of sparing one's self, even in
   relation to the corporeal life, is presented as per se strictly valid;
   "no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
   even as the Lord the church" [Eph. v, 29]. Man is also to exercise this
   duty of sparing in view of his own possible sinning; in protecting his
   moral innocence, man protects also the image of God as created in him.

  SECTION CXX.

   (b) Moral appropriating is, as regards the moral person himself,
   directly at the same time also a moral forming of the person into a
   progressively more perfect expression of the moral idea,--into a
   personally-peculiar realization of the moral end; and in proportion as
   the moral person appropriates to itself its own self, puts itself into
   possession of itself, it accomplishes upon itself also a moral forming.

   (1) Not the body is to appropriate to itself the spirit, but the spirit
   is progressively more and more to appropriate to itself the body, and
   to form it, and thereby also to form itself; hence the spirit alone is
   the appropriating factor, and the body is simply to be appropriated and
   formed. Even as nature stands to God in a twofold relation, namely, in
   that, on the one hand, God accomplishes his will in it, makes it good,
   and, on the other, reveals himself through it, makes it into his image,
   into an object of beauty, so also has the body in relation to the
   spirit the twofold destination of being its organ and its image; the
   former it becomes essentially by particular forming, the latter by
   general forming (§§ 109, 110).

   (a) The body is formed and appropriated to itself by the spirit as its
   true absolutely subservient organ, in that (1) it is strengthened and
   rendered apt in accomplishing every service for the rational will,
   through the mediating and carrying out of all appropriating and forming
   action of the rational spirit as bearing upon the external world; (2)
   in that, in its sensuous impulses, it is held under the discipline of
   the spirit, and is never allowed to have an independent right for
   itself; in both these respects realizes itself the complete domination
   of the spirit over the body.

   It is characteristic of the true moral nature of man, that he is
   capable, not merely, as is the case with the brute, of appropriating
   and forming external objects, but also himself. The brute is formed by
   nature, not by itself, and it appropriates to itself only nature, but
   not itself; but man in his first-given condition does not as yet really
   have himself, but must first learn to possess himself,--must attain to
   moral ownership of himself.

   Man virtualizes his god-likeness primarily in this, that he glorifies
   God even in his body as the temple of the Holy Ghost [1 Cor. vi, 19,
   20], and that he presents this body to God as a living, holy, and
   well-pleasing sacrifice [Rom. xii, 1.] The preliminary manifold
   dependence of the spirit on the body, and through the body also on
   external nature, is to be overcome and changed into spiritual freedom;
   the spirit is itself to make the body truly its own body, to
   appropriate it to itself as a moral possession, to form it into the
   perfect organ of the spirit,--in a certain sense, to create it
   spiritually. The original foreignness of the body to the spirit is to
   be overcome; its as yet partially-actual independence is to be broken;
   the body is to be thoroughly permeated by the spirit, and all that is
   merely objective and unfree in it, to be done away with. The dominion
   of the spirit over nature, which is set before it as a moral goal, is
   to realize itself first on its own nature, that is, on the body. That
   this is a moral task is plainly indicated by nature itself. The brute
   is much earlier self-supporting and mature than man, and needs no
   training in order to attain to its greatest skill; all the skill that
   man attains to he has to get by learning, to acquire by moral effort;
   and all learning is an appropriating through consciousness; man must in
   some manner first comprehend his body, before he can really form it and
   take it under his control; he who is spiritually dull usually remains
   also physically clumsy; man as coming from the hands of nature is the
   most helpless and most unskillful of creatures; all that he ever
   becomes is by the spirit,--by free moral activity; that his nascent
   life is much more helpless than that of any of the animals, is simply
   an incident of his high moral dignity. That which he has from nature is
   indeed good, but if it remains as mere unspiritualized, undominated
   nature, then it becomes for him evil,--becomes something of which he is
   to be ashamed. This rendering the body skillful is a
   personally-particular forming--a working of the spirit upon the body;
   thereby the spirit forms the body into its own true possession; it
   aspires to have it for itself, to have it entirely in its control.
   Herein consists also the true particular appropriating, the enjoying,
   of the body; man enjoys it when he has it fully in his power. This is
   the secret of the rich enjoyment of young persons, when, in free
   corporeal movement, in skillful playing, in skating, in rhythmical
   muscular action, etc., they feel themselves masters over their bodies;
   it is the consciousness of freedom, of acquired mastery; for, all
   consciousness of mastery is a feeling of happiness, and that, too, a
   per se legitimate one.

   Man is to form and appropriate to himself his body in two respects; for
   as a spirit lie stands to the outer world in the double relation of
   receiving and of influencing,--through the senses and through the
   organs of motion. The cultivation of the senses is more an
   appropriating than a real forming; the senses must first be brought
   under the control of the spirit; the seaman and the huntsman have not
   always a really sharper natural eye than others, but their seeing is
   more skilled,--they see many objects from which others may indeed
   receive exactly the same light-impressions, but yet not actually
   perceive them, for the reason that they overlook them; seeing is an
   art, and many, though with open eyes, see comparatively little. An
   uncultured person hears, in a beautiful piece of music, little more
   than confused sounds, for the reason that he does not know how to hear.
   It is a moral duty of man to develop his senses to perfection, fully to
   appropriate them to himself, for they were given to him by God as
   channels through which to appropriate to himself the outer world; and
   it is unthankfulness to God for man to be willing to see and hear
   little or nothing in God's nature,--for him to have no open eyes for
   the glory of God as resplendent in creation, and no ear for the
   beautiful harmonies of nature and art. Rudeness and unculture are
   sinful in every respect, and hence also in respect to the senses.

   The appropriating training of the organs of motion to vigorous
   skillfulness, not merely as a pleasure but also as a duty, is brought
   about under normal circumstances not so much by calculating art as by
   spontaneous natural activity; and it takes place chiefly during youth.
   While it was an error of many former educators entirely to neglect the
   training of the body to skillfulness and grace, still, on the other
   hand, there is danger of overestimating the worth of regulated
   gymnastics. The unnatural physical life of our city populations may
   render necessary a systematic process of corporeal exercise,
   notwithstanding its manifold unesthetic and even repulsive
   joint-wrenchings; but where the young people can have scope for
   indulging in more natural and frolicksome muscular recreation, regular
   gymnastics are doubtless quite superfluous; the learned cramming of
   overcrowded schools needs them indeed as a sanitary complement, but it
   is dangerous to substitute mere medicine for daily bread. It is a
   morbid condition of society, when that to which nature itself prompts
   us has to be made a school-requirement.

   The complete subordinating of the sensuous impulses to the discipline
   of the spirit, that is, the training of the body by the spirit to
   temperateness in respect to all sensuous enjoyments, and to such
   activity as is necessary to its being a proper organ for the spirit, is
   also, at the same time, an appropriating and a forming; the members are
   to be formed into "instruments of righteousness unto God" [Rom. vi, 12,
   13]. Paul represents the complete dependence of the body on the moral
   spirit as a dependence, not on the merely individual spirit, but on the
   spirit as morally subordinating itself to God. Man, as consecrated to
   God, is not to permit the per se legitimate caring for his body to
   become a fostering of the sensuous desires [Rom. xiii, 13, 14], but is
   strictly to subordinate the nurturing of the body and the indulgence in
   sensuous enjoyments to the rational purposes of the moral spirit, so
   that they shall simply be means for the spirit and never ends, in
   themselves [Luke xxi, 34; Rom. xiv, 17; Eph. v, 18; 1 Thess. v, 6; 1
   Tim. iii, 2; Tit. ii, 1 sqq.; 1 Pet. iv, 7, 8]. Temperateness, however,
   does not imply the taking of the least possible quantity of food and
   drink, nor indeed indifference to the sensuous pleasures of the table;
   this would in fact be unthankfulness toward the goodness of God who has
   prepared for us also this pleasure; it does, however, require the
   observance of that measure which is conditioned on the needs and health
   of the body, and on the properly understood social relations of the
   person. Excessive indulgence is not only a degradation of the person
   himself, but also uncharitableness toward the destitute.

  SECTION CXXI.

   (b) The body is to be formed into an image or symbol of the rational
   spirit,--to become a revelation of the spirit in the external world;
   that is, it is to be shaped into an object of beauty, into a
   spiritualized expression of the moral personality. This takes place:
   (1) immediately,--in that the body, without the express and conscious
   activity of the person, is formed into a true expression of the
   morally-cultured spirit; (2) mediately,--in that the body, which though
   per se possessing the highest nature-beauty, is yet not to remain in
   simply that state, is formed by means of a spiritually-expressive
   characterizing adornment into an expression of artistic beauty,--into a
   symbolical expression not merely of the spiritual in general, but also
   of the personally-moral character in particular,--and in that, with
   moral carefulness, it is kept free from whatever would present it in
   the light of an object that is disesteemed or given over to natural
   unfreedom, and cast off by the spirit,--the virtue of cleanliness.
   Adornment, both under its positive and its negative phase, is a moral
   duty, not merely out of regard to others, as the true moral
   presentation and revelation of self to others, but also out of regard
   to the moral person himself.

   The natural perfection of the body is not yet the true,--is to be
   exalted from natural beauty to spiritual. As the spirit (exists
   primarily only in a germinal form, hence the body cannot, from the very
   beginning, bear the full impress of the same; the spiritual expression
   of the body is at first not that of the personally-formed, but only of
   the as yet impersonal, spirit in general. The expression of the
   countenance becomes really spiritual, truly beautiful, only by and
   through a personal character-development, which is, in turn, reflected
   back from this personal peculiarity. The spirit must already have
   behind it a moral history, before it comes to expression in the
   features. A general beauty without character, is meaningless; a
   personally-spiritual beauty is winning and magnetic. The body becomes
   truly beautiful only through the complete appropriating of the same by,
   and for, the spirit; and the true secret of beauty consists in a
   genuine spiritual and moral culture. Where falseness has not yet gained
   firm foothold, there the countenance is the mirror of the soul; and,
   for the skilled look, even disguising falseness is transparent. There
   lies at the basis of "physiognomics" a deep truth; but this truth is
   not expressible in definite words and lines. It is not by mere chance
   that for certain historic personalities, such as those of Christ and
   the more prominent of the apostles, certain very definite forms and
   casts of countenance have found their place in Christian art, and by
   which every one recognizes them at first glance. The true
   character-expression of the cultured body is, in some sense,
   spirit-imbued,--is sensuous and supersensuous at the same time; neither
   words, nor outlines, nor even the photographic pencil of nature, is
   capable of reproducing it, but only the spirit-guided hand of the
   artist; spirit is recognized and grasped only by spirit; no photograph
   of a spiritual, character-imbued face attains to the fidelity of an
   artistic portrait. In a sinless state, the beauty of the spirit would
   necessarily reveal itself in beauty of body. So also must it have been
   in the case of Christ,--and the erroneous notion that for a time
   prevailed in the early church, to the effect that in Christ there had
   been no physical comeliness, was soon dissipated by the correct
   consciousness of Christian art. The heavenly soul of Christ must have
   depicted itself in his countenance [comp. Psa. xlv, 3]; and the reason
   why the children approached Him with glad confidence and shouted:
   "Hosanna!" is doubtless because of a direct impression which Christ's
   person made upon them; children have a wonderful capacity for reading
   character in the external appearance. Female vanity, in laying such
   great stress on corporeal beauty, is guilty simply of applying to
   sinfully-perverted reality, the thought, that is correct for the
   unfallen state of humanity, namely, that beauty of body is evidence of
   a beautiful soul. The moral task in relation to this culture of bodily
   expression, is, happily, not an immediate intentional forming of the
   body, but rather the moral forming of the soul, which then, in turn, of
   itself impresses itself on the body.

   The ornamentation of the body, including the exclusion of all
   uncleanliness, is a very important moral duty, and one that is very
   definitely emphasized in the Scriptures. On the subject of nudity and
   clothing, there has been, both from the moral and from the artistic
   stand-point, much disputing. Greek art, in its golden age, represented
   some of the gods nude; at a later period, when it had stooped to the
   service of worldliness rather than of religion, it expressed itself
   predominantly in the nude. Still, however, only such gods appear nude
   as represent a certain degree of moral and spiritual unripeness or
   sensuousness; Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, appear almost always draped; for
   spiritually-developed and historical characters, also among human
   beings, nudity was an artistic impossibility. This suggests the true
   law in the case. Nudity represents merely the naturally-beautiful, not
   the spiritually-beautiful, merely the human in general, not the
   personal in particular,--is that which is alike in all persons, not
   that in which they spiritually differ. That portion of the body which
   does not express the merely general, that is, the countenance, is, in
   fact, uniformly left free of clothing. The very sense for the
   morally-spiritual gives even a stronger expression to the personal
   through the medium itself of clothing. Who could bear the thought of a
   nude Caesar or Homer! Christian art rejected the nude, for the good
   reason that it had spiritual characters to represent. Moreover, mere
   nudity is artistically beautiful only in the form of lust-repellent,
   colorless sculpture; in painting it becomes licentious and, therefore,
   un-beautiful. It is a very false opinion, that clothing really conceals
   beauty; clothing, as an expression of the spiritual, as a free artistic
   creation, is in fact the higher beauty. This appears very clearly when
   man is represented not as an individual, but in groups; a
   bathing-place, swarming with nude figures, presents assuredly no
   beautiful spectacle, even if they were so many Apollos; precisely where
   man appears in his higher truth, namely, in society, there a beautiful
   scene is presented only by the help of diversified,
   character-expressive clothing. It is true, clothing is beautiful only
   where it is really expressive of a character, whether of the nation or
   of the person. The slavish copying after journals of fashion, is
   evidence of a want of sense and of character, and of a lack of esthetic
   perception.

   Clothing did not first become necessary because of sin. The Biblical
   account implies only, that it became necessary prematurely, and for
   another than its normal reason,--namely, before the development of
   personal character had led to its invention as an adornment. The sin of
   the first pair effected only that the hitherto-innocent consorts felt,
   now, shame in each other's presence, and that clothing, the proper
   object of which is ornamentation, was turned into a garb of penance.
   Clothing was not the very first want of persons living as yet in the
   most primitive simplicity; nor was yet its lack the characteristic
   trait of the Paradisaical state; clothing would have become a moral
   requirement also in the unfallen state so soon as man had grown into
   families, and the riper character of parents appeared in the presence
   of children [comp. Gen. ix, 21 sqq.] The nudity of savages is not
   innocence, but shameless rudeness.

   Animals do not decorate themselves, they are decorated already; man
   exalts himself above the animal by ingenious decoration. The tawdry
   ornamentation of savages exemplifies this, under a rude form; with
   them, the mere changing of the natural form is regarded as a
   beautifying; the notion of ornamentation is conceived under an
   essentially negative form; the unnatural itself is regarded as
   beautiful. There is a higher significance in the hunter's hanging about
   himself the skins of the bear or lion;--this is to him essentially a
   decoration of honor, a sign of his courage. Thus also, in the simpler
   forms of civilized life, it is an honor for a woman personally to weave
   and to prepare her own clothing and that of the family; it is natural
   for man to display his work, the fruit of his skill; but he also loves
   to manifest his spiritual idiosyncrasy under an esthetic form in the
   ornamentation of the body. Clothing and ornamentation in general, when
   of a normal character, manifest, in part, the general element, the
   natural peculiarity, and, in part, the personal peculiarity; hence in
   the style of the clothing we can to a certain extent recognize the
   personal character; the distinction between male and female clothing
   among all civilized nations has a deep moral ground [comp. Deut. xxii,
   5]; and just as, on the one hand, it is usually foolish and vain for an
   individual to break entirely with a general national custom, so, on the
   other, it is evidence of spiritual imbecility to make one's entire
   outward appearance a piece of mere imitation, without personal
   peculiarity.

   The Scriptures attach some importance to a befitting adornment,
   especially in its moral significancy. Jehovah himself prescribes a
   worthy garb for those who officiate in his worship [Exod. xxviii and
   xxxix; Num. xv, 38 sqq.]; a holy adornment becomes those who offer
   worship to the Lord [Psa. xxix, 2; comp. Exod. xix, 10; Ezek. xxiv,
   17]. When Christ in his parable [Matt. xxii, 2 sqq.] characterizes the
   not putting on of the wedding-garment as a serious fault, he manifestly
   does more than allude to a mere worthless custom [comp. Gen. xli, 14];
   and the apostle does not consider it unimportant to commend to the
   societies a becoming adornment [1 Tim. ii, 9, 10].

   That cleanliness of body and of clothing is regarded not only in the
   Old Testament [Exod. xix, 10; xxix, 4; Lev. viii, 66; Num. viii, 6
   sqq.; xxxi, 21 sqq.; comp. Prov. xxxi, 25], but also in all the higher
   heathen religions and in Islamism, as an important moral and religious
   duty, so that in fact a large part of the worship consists in washings,
   with direct symbolical reference to moral purification,--is a plain
   indication of the deep moral significancy of bodily purity. The
   sanitary interest is here merely incidental; the essential point is the
   outward expressing of the spiritual. Man is to bear, in his entire
   inner nature, as well as in his outward manifestation, a
   spiritually-moral impress,--is to be, in all respects, an expression of
   free self-determination, is to have upon himself nothing which has
   attached itself to him merely outwardly or fortuitously, as something
   belonging not to him, but to an extraneous nature-body,--is to be a
   purely spiritual creation. Uncleanliness is the expression of unfree
   nature,--of a dependent, passive belonging to mere outward nature, an
   evidence of self-abandonment, self-disesteem and dishonor, and is
   regarded among all cultivated nations as a symbol and actual indication
   of sin; it has never been any thing other than isolated spiritual
   perversions of humanity who have found an especial wisdom and greatness
   of soul in an open display of uncleanliness. Sensual pleasure-seeking,
   riotousness and moral degradation usually lead to corporeal filthiness;
   and it is a very wise principle of education in the case of the morally
   abandoned, and in missions among rude tribes, to place a very high
   value on bodily cleanliness. The precepts as to cleansing, in the Old
   Testament, are based on this ground; Christianity expressly declares
   carefulness about outward cleanliness as a virtue intimately connected
   with religion [Matt. vi, 17; comp. John xiii, 4 sqq.].

   To the gracefulness and beauty of the physique, belongs also that
   manner of movement or bearing which answers to the spiritual character,
   to beauty of soul; the cultivation of skillfulness of movement leads
   directly to the culture of esthetical motion. The beauty of movement
   consists in the fact that it expresses the perfect mastery of the soul
   over the body, and thus presents, in the body, not merely the organ of
   the will, but also, through the element of the beautiful, an image of
   the self-harmonious spirit,--in youth an expression of heart-gladness,
   in age that of earnest dignity. The dance is esthetic only in youth, in
   the mature it is repulsive.

  SECTION CXXII.

   (2) Moral appropriating and forming, as bearing upon the spirit itself,
   that is, the moral striving of the spirit to have and to possess itself
   as its own moral product, takes place through conscious, free activity,
   although indeed in the unconscious nature of the personal spirit there
   exists an impulse ill that direction. In so far as man is a rational
   spirit he has before him his own self as a moral task,--is to form
   himself into a moral personality, into a character; all non-advancement
   is here retrogression. This appropriating and forming relates to the
   spirit both as cognizing, as feeling, and as willing, and looks to the
   harmony of these three phases of the spirit-life.

   It is only when the spirit makes itself into its own possession,--forms
   itself into a truly rational spirit, that it is a moral spirit. He who
   is only a product of other spirits, who allows himself passively to be
   molded merely by the spirit that for the time being prevails in
   society, is, even when this spirit is a good one, not yet morally
   mature, but is in moral nonage; he is not yet a person, not yet a
   character. What Christ says [Matt. xxv, 14 sqq.] of putting to use the
   talents received, holds good also of the moral endowments of man; he
   dare not leave them idle, but must put them to moral usury,--must mold
   himself by spiritual appropriation into richer self-possession. He who
   "has not,"--who leaves idle his received talent, who makes it not into
   a vital possession,--does not retain it even as an unproductive power,
   but loses what he already has, and for the simple reason that it is a
   general law that a life-power, if unawakened into activity, dies away
   and perishes; it is only in virtue of a vital progressive development
   that the spiritual can be preserved,--even as water is saved from
   stagnation only by motion. The state of innocence cannot be preserved
   by mere non-doing; moral indolence would let even the trees of life in
   Paradise wither away. By the leaving idle of that which is destined to
   development, man sinks to moral dullness and insensibility; the
   spiritual condition of savages is a manifestation of the consequences
   of burying the received talent.

   The culture of self by the appropriation of truth, that is, the forming
   of self to knowledge and wisdom, is presented in the Scriptures as one
   of the highest moral duties, and it is inadmissible to limit this
   appropriation to merely religious and moral truth, though of course
   this is the principal thing (§ 104). God actually directed the first
   man to the acquirement of knowledge by the fact of his referring him to
   the objective world about him (§ 60), and in the fact that He made
   known himself and his will to him. But the knowledge of good and evil
   was forbidden to man, for the reason that a real knowledge of the
   latter was possible only by its realization; he was indeed to know what
   he should not do, but not to know of a real evil, and only a real
   entity can be truly known; but the woman sought after a wisdom [Gen.
   iii, 6] apart from true wisdom, and consequently fell.

   Feeling is primarily of an immediate, involuntary character; but man is
   not to be under the power of unfree feelings; he is rational only when
   he develops his feelings into moral ones,--brings them under the
   control of his rational knowledge and of his moral volitions. There is
   absolutely no place in the human mind or heart for any thing that is
   not morally willed or conditioned. Hence it is a moral duty to
   cultivate our feelings into moral integrity, so that they may never
   incur the liability of being reproached by the moral
   consciousness,--never, even involuntarily, entertain envy, and the
   like. In the ante-sinful state such feelings of course do not yet
   exist; but non-moral feelings become very soon sinful ones unless they
   become developed. And even the, as yet, uncorrupted feelings are
   primarily still in a crude state and in need of culture. The feeling of
   delight, and hence of happiness, rises with the increase of culture;
   the first human beings could not be so happy in their first days as
   they could have been after further moral development. They too were
   liable to have morally false feelings. It is true there was as yet
   nothing immoral before their eyes which could have become an object of
   immoral delight; but they had, before them, themselves as in need of
   further development; hence if they had felt perfectly contented in this
   state of need, instead of thirsting after a higher perfection, this
   feeling would have been immoral. On the other hand, they were capable
   of feeling displeasure at the divine,--as in fact actually occurred in
   view of the divine prohibition. And the pleasure which Eve felt in the
   words of the tempter was already decidedly immoral, seeing that it
   implied a will not to follow the will of God, and was essentially the
   fall itself.

   But feeling must be formed not merely as to its quality, but also as to
   its degree of liveliness. If only the more prominent phases of good and
   evil make an impression upon us, while the less prominent ones pass
   before us unnoticed, then our moral feeling is obscure and obtuse. The
   fact that feeling, like the bodily senses, is affected at first only by
   the stronger impressions, implies of itself the duty of making it
   sensitive--sensitive even for the most delicate features of the godly
   or the ungodly. And this can be brought about only by a constantly
   increasing growth in knowledge,--by an attending to whatever takes
   place within and without us; we must prove all things and hold fast to
   the best, the good, and that too not merely as knowledge but also as
   the possession of our heart, as our delight and joy.--Our feelings, as
   moral, stand not outside of, but also under our will. The notion that
   the heart cannot be commanded, is absolutely immoral,--is an assertion
   of man's irresponsibility. Natural feeling does indeed precede the
   will, but moral feeling is, under one phase, determined by the moral
   will [§ 93]. It is not left to the hearts of children whether they will
   or can love their parents, they are bound to love them; and the same is
   true of wedlock-love, of our love to our calling, to our rulers, to our
   country. The first promptings of feeling are as yet extra-moral, but in
   that by this first excitation the will becomes free and is set into
   activity, it then in turn directs its activity also upon the feelings
   and the affections.

   That willing is in harmony with knowing and feeling, is primarily
   strictly natural; in man, however, as distinguished from the much
   earlier self-possessing animal, this agreement is primarily only
   approximative; the will must be exercised in order to be sure of
   itself; man must first learn how to use it. There is need of a moral
   will in order that the will nay become moral. This has all the
   appearance of a vicious circle, but it is not; the fact is, I must in
   general, and as a principle, have a will always to follow the truth, in
   order that, in particular, I may actually form my individual will
   morally, and make it subject to recognized truth. The spirit is willing
   but the flesh is weak; this is relatively true also in a normal
   development of mankind; this flesh is, however, not merely
   sensuousness, but also the spirit itself, the will, in so far as it has
   not as yet become veritably free. The will of the spirit must become
   something which it is not, as yet, from the very start,--truly free;
   and it is free only when that feebleness, which is primarily merely a
   sort of clumsiness, is overcome,--when the spirit is not only in
   general willing to do God's will, but also shows in each particular
   case the same unwavering willingness. That which, in a state of
   sinfulness, becomes a self-conflicting double will [Rom. vii, 15 sqq.],
   exists also in the ante-sinful state, at least in so far as to
   constitute a difference between the will as purely individual and the
   will as truly rational, God-consecrated, and self-denying. The former
   is not to be done away with, but to be harmoniously subordinated to the
   latter; the will must be so formed as that we can say at every moment:
   I will, and yet not I, but God who dwells in me. The will should not be
   a willful will, but must be molded into an obedient one,--into
   obedience to the divine will, which, in virtue of our love to God,
   becomes at one with our own will. In obeying, man distinguishes indeed
   his own will from God's will, but he subordinates his will, not
   lothfully but in loving willingness, to the lovingly-appropriated
   divine will,--transfigures the former, more and more, by his love of
   the latter, so that finally there are no longer two wills, but only
   one,--and that, not in virtue of any destruction, but simply in virtue
   of love, not by violence but through freedom,--by following the example
   of Christ in the constant practice of the principle: "Not my will, but
   thine be done" [Luke xxii, 42; Matt. vi, 10; John v, 30; Psa. xl, 8;
   Jer. vii, 23; Matt. vii, 21; xii, 50; 1 John ii, 17; Heb. xiii, 21].
   Every moral will must say with Christ: "My meat is to do the will of
   him that sent me" [John iv, 34]; obedience is the food of the
   soul,--forms and strengthens the will to an increasingly freer and
   holier manner of willing. Only those are the children of God who are
   led by the spirit of God,--who permit themselves freely to be guided by
   Him, who will only in and through Him [Rom. viii, 14].

   Hence also in the forming of the will we have to distinguish between
   the quality and the degree. A will may in fact be good in quality, may
   aim at the good and detest the evil, and yet be lacking in strength and
   in steadfastness,--may shrink before difficulties; it may begin well
   and yet not bring to perfection; good resolutions do not necessarily
   imply a truly good will; in fact, the road to hell is said to be paved
   with good resolutions. He who has a good will only at first, but does
   not really carry out any thing, is as yet unfree in his will,--has it
   not under his control, and is yet a moral minor; he does not actually
   will at every particular conjuncture that which he wills in general.
   Hence it is man's duty to place his will entirely under the dominion of
   moral reason, to mold it to freedom, in order that in particular cases
   it may not offer resistance to good resolutions in general,--in a word,
   that a will of the flesh may not oppose itself to the will of the
   spirit.

III. THE MORAL ACTIVITY AS RELATING TO OTHER PERSONS.

  SECTION CXXIII.

   (a) The moral sparing of others consists in a real recognition of their
   moral personality, and hence of their personal independence, freedom,
   and honor.

   (a) Man's personal independence and freedom, which are the expression
   of his morally rational essence, may be limited by others only in the
   interest of higher moral ends, namely, either in order to train the as
   yet morally and spiritually immature toward real freedom, or in the
   moral interests of the moral whole or society.--(b) The personal honor
   of our fellow-man is preserved when we recognize and treat him as a
   morally-rational being called to God-likeness and God-sonship, and
   hence as capable of, and entitled to, moral communion with us,--when we
   do nothing toward him which is inconsistent therewith,--which would
   stigmatize him as non-moral, or, undeservedly, as immoral and
   irrational; this is the duty of respecting our neighbor, and as implied
   therein of respecting the personal dignity of man in general,--the duty
   of sparing and protecting the good name of our neighbor.--(g) From
   these two duties follows the duty of a sparing respect for whatever
   appertains to our neighbor,--belongs to him as a possession, is his
   property in the broadest sense of the word, that is, whatever he has a
   right to call his own,--and hence a positive avoidance of all action
   whereby it would be damaged or alienated from our neighbor.

   Even as our personal morality does not consist in undisciplined
   arbitrary discretion, but in the controlling our own will by the will
   of God, so also there is no moral influencing of our fellow-man without
   a limiting of his individual will, of his individual liberty, and that
   too in the very interest of his higher personal freedom. The child
   cannot be educated without that in many respects limits be set to its,
   as yet, unripe, unintelligent will; in the person of the educator it is
   confronted with the principles of moral order under which it is to bow
   its individual will; it is in fact an essential part of the duty of
   sparing the personality of the child, that it be not allowed to grow up
   in rudeness. As the child is related to its parents, so is the
   individual person to the moral whole. He whose calling it is to govern,
   must confine the liberty of the individual within the order of the
   whole,--must in some measure limit it in order that all may become
   truly free; in an organized moral community it is each member's duty to
   co-operate in the realization of moral order, and hence to hold within
   bounds both his own will and the will of others. Hence the moral
   sparing of others is never of an unconditional character, but finds a
   limit in the duty of moral culture; but within this limit the duty of
   sparing becomes all the more imperative. The limiting may never be such
   as to reduce the object to a mere will-less creature of arbitrary
   discretion; the right of the object of education or guidance to be an
   independent moral personality with a moral purpose of its own, may
   never be ignored. He who is as yet morally a minor may never be treated
   as if he were always to remain such,--never as a mere means to an
   end,--but he must be treated as having an end in himself. A slavish
   education is sinful; despotic government is immoral, whether exercised
   by a single individual or by a minority-crushing majority. Whatever
   apology may be made for slavery in a sinful world, in the sphere of
   pure morality it is absolutely anti-moral.

   The sparing and respecting of the personal honor of others, appears
   among the chief commands in the Old Testament [Exod. xx, 16; Lev. xix,
   16], and is presented also in the Gospel as one of the most essential
   of duties [Matt. v, 21, 22]. My neighbor has upon me a claim to respect
   for his honor, for his good name. Man is not a mere isolated unit, but
   a vital member of a moral whole; the personal honor, the good name, of
   each is the moral bond which holds together the community; he who has
   lost respect in society stands outside of the scope of its
   common-life,--is a broken-off leaf soon to wither away.--The sparing of
   the possessions of others [Exod. xx, 15, 17; Lev. xix, 35, 36; Deut.
   xxv, 13 sqq.; xxvii, 17; 1 Thess. iv, 6] is only a special phase of the
   sparing of the person of others. In his property man creates for and
   about himself a little world which as the product of his labor, belongs
   to him, which he calls his earnings, and for which he has consequently
   a moral right to recognition and respect on the part of others.

  SECTION CXXIV.

   (b) The moral appropriating and the forming of others are, in virtue of
   the mutual moral relation of men to each other, always associated
   together in a normal state of things,--each being and involving at the
   same time also the other; and both take place at the same time in the
   moral act of love. In active love toward his neighbor, man brings about
   also love toward himself, for the beloved person becomes united to, and
   appropriated by, him who loves; the active love of one's neighbor is
   therefore an appropriating and a forming at the same time, both in
   respect to the neighbor and in respect to the loving person himself.
   The exercise of love breaks down the antithesis of individual persons,
   but at the same time respects their moral rights and moral
   independence.

   It is noteworthy that in the Scriptures we never read of the love of
   mankind, but always of the love of neighbor; [Matt. vi, 14, 15 is only
   a seeming exception to this, as here "men" stand in contrast to God].
   Christ's love to us is indeed called love to man or to the brethren,
   but never love to neighbor; but our love to man in general, and not
   merely to our Christian brethren, is always called love to neighbor. In
   this very circumstance the moral relation of men to each other is
   directly indicated. My fellow-man does not stand before me as a mere
   isolated individual, but as one who, by God's will, is near to me,--who
   belongs to me for my full love, belongs to me so intimately that there
   ought to be nothing strange or uncongenial between him and me. In love,
   my neighbor becomes mine, and I his; hence love is a mutual
   appropriating; and by the fact that I thereby enlarge both my
   life-sphere and his own, it is at the same time a mutual forming. Love
   seeks not merely the welfare of the other, but also his love. In the
   act of love I form the other, in that I impart myself to him as loving,
   and that too in my moral character; I rejoice him and exalt his moral
   life, in that I stimulate him to reciprocal love. At the same time also
   I exercise a formative influence on myself, in that by this communion I
   am myself exalted and promoted in my spiritually-moral existence,--in
   that I spiritually appropriate to myself an other spiritual being.

   The law of love is presented by Christ as the highest of all commands,
   and love of neighbor as the substance of all moral duties toward our
   fellow-man [Matt. xxii, 39, 40; John xiii, 34, 35; xv, 12, 17; comp.
   Rom. xii, 10; xiii, 8-10; Gal. v, 14; Eph. v, 2; 1 Thess. iv, 9; 1 Cor.
   xiii, 1 sqq.; 1 Pet. i, 22; iv, 8; 1 John iii, 11; James ii, 8; Heb.
   xiii, 1]. All fulfilling of duty toward our neighbor is an exercise of
   love; when not so it is but deception; that which springs not of love,
   is not only morally worthless, but also immoral, because counterfeit.
   Love is the test of true God-sonship [1 John iv, 12, 13], "for love is
   of God, and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God" [1
   John iv, 7]; human love is thankful reciprocation for that love which
   first loved us,--is true religion [James i, 27]; and love to God must
   necessarily manifest itself also in love to the beloved of God [1 John
   iv, 20, 21; v, 1, 2]. The precept of love to neighbor is presented even
   in the Old Testament as a chief duty [Lev. xix, 18], and is expressly
   extended to non-Israelites [verse 34; Deut. x, 19; Micah vi, 8; Zech.
   vii, 9]; what a contrast this forms to the boasted "humanitarianism" of
   the Greeks to whom every non-Greek was a right-less barbarian! Thou
   shalt love thy neighbor "as thyself;" this is not a mere comparison of
   two parallel forms of love,--both are at bottom but one love; a truly
   moral love of one's self as a moral personality, necessarily manifests
   itself also as love to other moral persons through whom in fact one's
   own rational being is heightened; true love of neighbor is also at the
   same time true self-love. This holds good even of the false love of
   neighbor; every one seeks, in some form, friendship and love, and feels
   himself unhappy in isolation; hence our Lord says: "If ye love [only]
   them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the Publicans the
   same?" [Matt. v, 46, 47; comp. Luke vi, 32]. If now even a false love
   of neighbor is at the same time a love of self, how much more so is the
   true love of neighbor!--not however, of course, in such a sense as that
   I love my neighbor only for my own sake, for that would be
   self-seeking, but in the sense that I love my neighbor for God's sake,
   and in this love of God exalt at the same time my own moral life, and
   find in the love of neighbor true moral enjoyment.

   The symbolical expression of mutual union in love is bodily touching,
   especially the giving of the hand [2 Kings x, 15; Gal. ii, 9], and in a
   higher form the kiss, which evinces a more intimate equality of love
   the more it is reciprocal; the kiss on the forehead or cheek is rather
   the sign of a condescending and more distant love, the kissing of the
   hand that of a reverential love, the kissing of the feet that of a
   humbly submissive love [Luke vii, 38; Isa. xlix, 23], the kiss on the
   lips that of a mutual, confidential, intimate love, and hence
   especially expressive also of sexual love. In the Scriptures the kiss
   appears as the sign of love between parents and children [Gen. xxvii,
   26, 27; xxxi, 28, 55; xlviii, 10; l, 1; Exod. xviii, 7; Ruth i, 9; 1
   Kings xix, 20; Luke xv, 20], between brothers and sisters and relatives
   [Gen. xxix, 11, 13; xxxiii, 4; xlv, 15; Exod. vi, 27; Ruth i, 14],
   between friends [1 Sam. xx, 41], as an expression of homage [1 Sam. x,
   1; Psa. ii, 12; Luke vii, 38], and as an expression of love in other
   respects [2 Sam. xx, 9; Matt. xxvi, 48 sqq.; Luke vii, 45; Acts xx,
   37]; hence it is also a symbol of reconciliation [Gen. xxxiii, 4; 2
   Sam. xiv, 33: Luke xv, 20]; and the fraternal kiss was, in the early
   church, a general custom [Rom. xvi, 16; 1 Cor. xvi, 20; 2 Cor. xiii,
   12; 1 Thess. v, 26; 1 Pet. v, 14.]

  SECTION CXXV.

   Active love is a self-impartation of the subject to the object,--an
   imparting of what is one's own to another in order to exalt his life.
   Hence it manifests itself in service-rendering, in benefiting; all
   moral community-life is a reciprocal service of love; every act of love
   is a sacrifice. Sympathizing love imparts every thing which is dear to
   it:--(a) It imparts its own spiritual possessions in order thereby to
   promote the spiritual life and the spiritual possessions of the other,
   and this, in virtue of an honest and truthful self-communication. To
   this communication corresponds, on the part of the object, the
   answering and accepting love of confidence, that is, a willingness to
   let himself be formed by the appropriation of the
   spiritually-communicating love of his fellow,--a being receptive for
   self-revealing truthfulness. (b) Love imparts also its material
   possessions, and is hence a devoting of our personal productive forces
   to the aid of the needy, in the fulfillment of the duties of charity
   and personal assistance. In imparting and devoting itself, love
   acquires a right to the reciprocating love of the other,--to
   thankfulness in heart and act.

   Love imparts lovingly to the beloved that which itself loves; only that
   in which I myself have pleasure, can I lovingly impart; for this reason
   every true act of love is a sacrifice, and a sacrifice that is not
   hesitatingly and stumblingly brought; love makes it easy; but every
   sacrifice must be made to God; only he who practices love for God's
   sake brings a proper offering. To do good and to communicate is
   expressly declared in the Scriptures as a God-pleasing sacrifice [Heb.
   xiii, 16]. The mite of the poor, when offered in love, avails more than
   the rich gift of the thoughtless spendthrift; in fact he who does not
   morally love his legitimately-obtained possessions, cannot in the
   nature of things make therefrom a sacrifice.

   Christ gives as the determining rule for our conduct toward our
   neighbor the general formula: "All things whatsoever ye would that men
   should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the
   prophets" [Matt. vii, 12]. Hence true self-love is the pattern and
   measure of love to neighbor; our own rational striving shows us what is
   the striving of others, and ought to put itself into harmony with the
   latter; that which I would acquire for myself as a right upon others,
   ought first to be a duty toward them. By this rule Christ implies, at
   the same time, that love begets answering love, and hence reverts back
   upon him who exercises it. This is a practical life-rule in answer to
   the question: flow shall I exercise love in each and every particular
   case? and it gives as the answer: Just as I should wish that it should
   be done to myself,--a very safe rule, provided always that my own moral
   consciousness in general is not beclouded, so that I should no longer
   know what would really serve to my peace. The precious is purchased
   only by the precious,--love only by love. All love seeks to serve; love
   of neighbor is ministering love. "Whosoever will be great among you,
   let him be your minister, and whosoever will be chief among you, let
   him be your servant, even as the Son of man came not to be ministered
   unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many" [Matt.
   xx, 26 sqq.]. Christ's love, the highest pattern, is itself the highest
   love-service, and has brought the greatest sacrifice; all love to God
   is a service of God; all neighbor-love is a God-serving in the service
   of the neighbor. "Let no man seek what is his own, but every man what
   is another's" [1 Cor. x, 24]; love to self must not become a separating
   of ourselves from others, nor a self-seeking using of them;
   self-seeking must be sacrificed in order to attain to true self-love in
   the love of neighbor. "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he
   said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" [Acts xx, 35]; giving
   makes happier in the very love-act itself, and, though a sacrificing,
   is yet at the same time a receiving, an enkindling of reciprocal love,
   an imitating of God and of Christ who out of love gave all; it is more
   blessed than receiving,--not that we are simply to give acts of love,
   and not also thankfully to receive them,--for he who cannot, out of
   love, receive, is unable also to give out of love, and he who, because
   of pride, will not receive, gives in fact only out of pride; but that
   kind of receiving is not blessed and does not render blessed, which is
   not willing also to give, but only to have, and in which the person
   regards only the bestowment as such, and not the love which makes
   it,--inclines only to possess the gift, but not to recognize the love
   and to reciprocate it in love. The moral person receives also gladly,
   out of love, from love, not however for the sake of the gift but for
   the sake of the giver,--desires indeed to receive love, but only for
   the reason that he himself loves. The giving of presents is a
   universally recognized sign of love, even where the moral consciousness
   appears under its rudest forms [Gen. xii, 16; xlv, 17 sqq.]; there is
   no love which does not seek to impart itself,--which would not gladly
   offer liberally, for the delight and enjoyment of the other, that in
   which the loving one himself has delight and enjoyment, and thus prove
   itself genuine by sacrifice [Gen. xxiv, 22, 53; xxxii, 13 sqq.; xlii,
   25; xliii, 11; xlv, 22 sqq.; 1 Sam. ix, 7 sqq.; xviii, 4; Prov. xviii,
   16]. Among certain rude tribes it is customary for friends to
   interchange names, as is, in fact, the case with one of the parties,
   even now, in Christian marriage; this is also a love-offering.

   Communicating love imparts indeed all that it has, but it does not give
   away all; the spiritual possession grows in imparting itself. The
   communicating of one's own spiritual possessions is the exercise of
   truthfulness. The rational spirit has, in virtue of its own duty of
   spiritual appropriating, an absolute right to truthfulness in the
   self-communications of. others, though indeed not an unconditional
   right to the communication of all that is known by others. Love admits
   of no falseness; and though there may be things in the life, even of
   the righteous, especially inner states, which may not and should not be
   communicated indiscriminately to every one,--for example, to the as yet
   morally immature,--still, this silence is essentially different from
   falsifying. In the Scriptures truthfulness is based on love; "speak
   every man truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another"
   [Eph. iv, 25], that is, because we are united as vital organs to a
   single moral body,--belong to each other, should he transparent to each
   other. "To this end," says Christ, "was I born, and for this cause came
   I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth" [John
   xviii, 37]; this is true of Christ also in his character of Son of man,
   and hence also of all men; now Christ came into the world out of love,
   and out of love he bore witness to the truth. Truth is the good, the
   divine, as relating to spiritual communicating. Whatever exists is for
   the personal spirit, and each personal spirit exists for all other
   personal spirits,--must be perfectly transparent to them, in so far as
   sin throws into it no shadow, in order that spirit in general, the
   essential nature of which is to unite the separated, may attain to the
   truth [Matt. v, 37; comp. Job xxvii, 4; Zech. viii, 16; Psa. xv, 2;
   xxxiv, 14; Rev. xiv, 5]. Where sin is not yet predominant, but love
   prevails, there truthfulness is easy and natural; it becomes difficult
   only where sin predominates.

   The formative influencing of others through the living-out of a moral
   character is to be regarded simply as a phase of the truthfulness of
   loving self-communication, and not as constituting a special duty of
   giving a good example [Matt. v, 14-16; Rom. xiv, 19; xv, 2; Phil. ii,
   15; iii, 17; Titus ii, 7; 1 Pet. ii, 9, 12, 15; comp. 1 Cor. iv, 16;
   xi, 1; Phil. iv, 9; 2 Thess. iii, 7]. No one may wish to be moral in
   order to appear moral; that would be downright hypocrisy; but also no
   one should desire to conceal that which in his character is truly
   moral; this would likewise be untruth. But in order to the formative
   influencing of others through moral self-manifestation, it is of course
   not enough simply to be inactive, simply as it were to let one's self
   be contemplated, but there is requisite, in view of the diverse
   characters that are to be influenced, a selection of special manners of
   self-communication; as bearing upon children the manner must be other
   than with the morally mature; from this, however, it does not follow
   that this self-impartation is to sink to a mere self-complacent display
   of self,--an intentional presentation of self as a moral pattern, in
   any respect whatever. This would be, even in a saint, a violation of
   becoming humility,--a tempting of hearts from Him who alone is the
   perfect type of holiness.

   Spiritual self-communicating, even when perfectly truthful, is not per
   se of a moral character, for, in view of the limitedness of men as
   individual persons, it is in fact a direct necessity; for this reason,
   perfect solitude is so great a torment; the recluse endures his
   freely-chosen solitude solely because he is engaged in a continuous
   spiritual self-communicating, namely, to God in prayer; a non-praying,
   unpious solitary would either be suffering the severest punishment or
   would be spiritually deranged. Self-impartation may even be sinful, as
   in purposeless, thoughtless gossip; it becomes moral only when it is a
   practicing of love. Loving self-communication seeks not its own but
   that which is another's. Falsehood is hatred, is lovelessness; where
   true love is there falsehood is impossible; hence the deep pain
   occasioned by falseness on the part of the beloved one.

   From the fact that truthfulness is an expression of love, it is
   entitled to answering love from the other party, to a ready welcoming,
   to confidence. It is true, confidence in men is generally presented in
   the Scriptures as deceiving [Psa. cxviii, 8; Jer. xvii, 5, 6, etc.];
   here, however, the question is only as to an unpious confidence which
   builds not upon God but upon man, and of the state of sinfulness in
   general. But where sin is not yet in the mastery, there mutual
   confidence is the necessary antecedent condition of all moral
   communion, and a necessary out-going of love. Distrust paralyzes love.
   The truthful have a moral right to confidence in their word; confidence
   is the reverse side of truthfulness. Even as Christ uniformly required
   faith and confidence in himself, because he was the Truth, so may every
   one who is of the Truth lay claim to confidence; hence confidence is
   not a discretionary state of the mind, but a moral act. The little
   child that was proposed to the disciples as a moral type, is such also
   in respect to trust and confidence.

   The more outward form of self-imparting through service-rendering [Gen.
   xxiv, 18 sqq.; xxxiii, 12, 15; Exod. ii, 17; Deut. xxii, 1 sqq.; Matt.
   xxi, 3; John xii, 2; xiii, 4 sqq.; Acts xxviii, 2; Gal. v, 13; 1 Pet.
   iv, 10; Heb. vi, 10; xiii, 16, etc.] which, on the supposition of a
   state of sinfulness, includes in itself also beneficence, is not as yet
   in the unfallen state a showing of pity, for misery does not exist save
   in a state of sin; but there is always need of mutual assistance so
   long as the last degree of perfection is not yet reached, and hence
   there is always also the duty of helping, through the imparting of our
   own forces and means,--of mutually complementing our possessions which
   largely vary according to the personal peculiarity of the possessors.

   Love is in its very nature communion-forming,--calls for the love of
   the other. And unreciprocated love presupposes sin. Love gives itself
   over, but it does not give itself away; it desires to find itself again
   in the beloved, even as light never shines without being reflected. The
   loving reflection of love, namely, love as the fruit of love, is
   thankfulness. He to whom thankfulness or unthankfulness is indifferent,
   has no love; even the Lord himself wept over Jerusalem when it spurned
   his love. The warmer the love, so much the more sensitively is felt the
   chill of thanklessness; only a taking refuge in the love of God can
   assuage this pang. But only he is entitled to thankfulness whose love
   is itself humble thanks to the loving God; without this the pretended
   right is simply presumptuous self-seeking. The moral worth of
   thankfulness and the despicableness of thanklessness are recognized
   even among the rudest tribes, as in fact even in brutes thankfulness is
   manifested by brightened looks; and hence Christ represents this duty
   as valid even among the heathen,--as instinctively commending itself to
   the natural consciousness, and as also practiced by man in his natural
   state [Matt. v, 46; Luke vi, 32, 33; comp. Exod. ii, 20; Josh. vi, 22
   sqq.; 1 Sam. xv, 6; 2 Kings v, 16, 23; Ruth ii, 10 sqq.; Luke xvii, 16;
   Acts xxiv, 3]. But only love has a right to thankfulness; a benefit
   which does not flow from love, which merely seeks thankfulness, does
   not deserve thankfulness, for it is inwardly false.

  SECTION CXXVI.

   At an equal stage of spiritually-moral maturity, men are related to
   each other as mutually-forming and appropriating each other to a like
   degree; but the more there is a difference in this maturity, so much
   the more predominates on the part of the morally higher-developed the
   formative influencing, and on the part of others the appropriating.
   However, the right and duty of formative influencing on the part of the
   morally less-developed never sinks to zero;--even the as yet morally
   immature inevitably exert a measure of moral influence upon the morally
   higher-developed and upon the totality of society.

   A complete moral equalization of all men as to their moral influencing
   of others would be an irrational reversing of all moral order, a
   dissolving of all historical life into unorganized individual units.
   Children never sustain to their parents a relation of perfect equality;
   their relation to them is always rather appropriating than formative;
   the resistance of children to the higher moral validity of the parents
   is regarded among almost all nations as a flagrant outrage, and
   reverence for age as a high virtue. But society at large is a moral
   whole, and here also the higher-advanced have and exercise naturally a
   guiding and an educative influencing-activity over and upon the others,
   and the totality has a higher validity than the individual. The
   higher-developed moral individual sustains to the morally-immature the
   right and duty of educative influencing; a perfectly holy man would
   enjoy per se a right to spiritually-moral dominion; and for this good
   reason, and not simply in virtue of his being the Son of God, is Christ
   our legitimate Lord. Nevertheless the right and duty of moral forming
   never sinks, even in case of the most immature, to absolute nothing;
   childish innocence has disarmed many an evil intent; the direct
   impression of guileless confidence, of unsuspicion, strikes the
   malicious purpose with shame. The pious simplicity of the faith-word of
   a child has often proved a heart-stirring awakening for vain
   wisdom-boasting unbelief.--Also toward the moral community, the
   individual sustains the right and the duty of moral influencing, though
   in a normal development of the community-life this influencing would
   give place very largely to appropriating; moreover it varies according
   to the varying social stations of the individual.

IV. THE MORAL ACTIVITY AS RELATING TO OBJECTIVE NATURE.

  SECTION CXXVII.

   (a) The moral sparing to which nature, in virtue of its essence as
   God's perfectly created work, and as an expression of the divine love
   and wisdom, has a right, requires that man, in the exercise of the
   moral dominion over nature to which he is called, regard this, its
   divine phase, with due respect,--that he avoid all purposeless and
   wanton changing or destroying of natural objects, and that, on the
   contrary, he exercise toward nature a considerate love, especially in
   its higher manifestations, by preserving them in their peculiarity. The
   duty of considerate sparing rises in proportion as the nature-creature
   comes into actual relation to human life, and enters into the sphere of
   his moral activity as a helping factor.

   Moral love to nature is thankfulness to God who gave it to us for moral
   enjoyment and for moral dominion; to man, as pure, God gave not an
   uncongenial and fear-awakening nature, but a Paradisaical nature. God
   loves nature as he made it, and from its bosom God's creative love
   beams out toward us, and he has even impressed manifold natural
   suggestions of the moral upon it; Christ himself requires respect for
   nature, for the heavens are God's throne and the earth is his footstool
   [Matt. v, 34, 35], and it is in virtue of this religious conceiving of
   nature that there can be moral duties also toward nature (as against
   Rothe, Ethik, 1. ed., iii, § 866). With the exception of the Indians,
   who adore nature as the revealed divine essence itself, no people has
   manifested so high a respect for nature as the Israelites; the
   legislation of the Old Testament surpasses all other systems in a
   considerate sparing of nature. Domestic animals especially are placed
   under the sparing protection and care of the law [Prov. xii, 10]; the
   mouth of the threshing ox is not to be muzzled [Deut. xxv, 4]; on the
   Sabbath cattle, also are given rest Exod. xx, 10]; and in the
   Sabbatical year both cattle and beasts are to pasture on the fallow
   lands [Exod. xxiii, 11; Lev. xxv, 6, 7, in the original text]; the
   beast of another that falls under its burden, or loses its way, is to
   be helped [Exod. xxiii, 5; Deut. xxii, 1 sqq.; comp. Matt. xii, 11];
   animals may not be castrated or otherwise maimed [Lev. xxii, 24; even
   the crossing of animals of different kinds is, in high moral
   recognition of the rights of nature-creatures, forbidden [Lev. xix,
   19]. With the greatest tenderness of feeling, a merely symbolical
   cruelty is not allowed; "thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's
   milk" [Exod. xxiii, 19; xxxiv, 26; Deut. xiv, 21]; it makes the
   impression of cruel mockery when the milk which is destined to nourish
   the young is used in connection with its death. Under the same category
   falls the prohibition of killing the calf, the kid, and the lamb, on
   the same day with its mother [Lev. xxii, 28], and of taking an
   incubating mother-bird at the same time with the nest [Deut. xxii, 6,
   7]. The touching account of the care of God for the animals at the time
   of the deluge, is an emphatic illustration of the moral sparing of
   animals as it should be exercised by man; God includes also animals in
   his covenant with Noah, and promises to spare them [Gen. ix, 10, 15].
   Christ himself illustrates his own relation to the body of believers in
   a gracious picture of a shepherd loving his flock [John x; comp. Matt.
   xviii, 12, 13].

   The piety-inspired careful sparing of whatever contributes to the
   nourishment of man, is so natural an expression of the moral
   consciousness that it prevails among almost all, and even barbarous,
   nations. Christ sanctions this significant carefulness [John vi, 12].
   This sparing has essentially a symbolical meaning,--is an evidencing of
   thankfulness for the good gifts of God,--a thankfulness which suffers
   not that these gifts of love be destroyed in wanton thoughtlessness and
   in purposeless waste, or contemptuously thrown away.

  SECTION CXXVIII.

   (b) The moral appropriating of nature is either of a purely spiritual,
   or of an actual character.--1. Spiritual appropriating consists, in
   addition to the legitimate striving after the highest possible
   knowledge of nature considered as a manifestation of divine power, love
   and wisdom, mainly in the reflective contemplating of nature in its
   symbolical suggestiveness of the moral,--God having implanted in it
   natural symbols of the moral.

   The thoughtful, moral contemplating of nature is at once of a pious and
   of a poetical character; [14] it is not a mere play of the fancy, it is
   veritable reality. Nature is not moral, but it is the work of Him who
   is himself perfect morality. Nature as created by the holy God must
   necessarily reflect this holiness as from a mirror; it is the high and
   mysterious charm of nature that it is not mere nature, but that
   everywhere the Spirit whispers out of its bosom and broods over its
   expanse. Nature reveals to us not only God's creative power, wisdom and
   glory [Rom. i, 20; Job xxxvii, sqq.; Psa. xcvii; civ; cxi, 2; cxlvii, 8
   sqq. ], [15] the heavens not only declare God's glory [Psa. xix, 1
   sqq.], but also God's love is made known to us in nature [Matt. vi, 26
   sqq.; Acts xiv, 17], and the bow on the clouds [Gen. ix, 12 sqq.] and
   the bespangled vault of the skies are symbols of the divine
   faithfulness [Gen. xv, 5]. But the moral consciousness finds still more
   than this; the phases of beauty that are perceived in nature are
   suggestions of spiritual beauty. It is not a groundless fancy when the
   mind discovers moral ideas symbolically suggested even in plants; we
   feel at once the kindredness of impression upon the sensibilities that
   is made by a delicate rose and by modest virginity, by a violet and by
   childlike humility, by an oak and by firmness of character. And the
   fact that animals so frequently directly remind us of human moral
   qualities, is simply evidence that the holy creative Spirit rules in
   them and discovers to us; in that which is merely natural, embryonic
   premonitions of the moral. The ant, the bee, etc., are natural emblems
   of the virtue of industry [Prov. vi, 6]; it is God who causes them
   busily to care for a common want,--who works in them in order to speak
   to man an unmistakable word of exhortation and instruction. The care of
   birds for their young, the fidelity of the dog and of the horse, are
   manifestations of a deeply suggestive character in nature. The quiet
   gentleness and the patient sufferance of the lamb are applied as types
   even to Christ [Isa. liii, 7; John i, 29, 36; 1 Pet. i, 19; Rev. v, 6,
   and elsewhere]; Christ himself uses the dove as a symbol of uprightness
   of heart [Matt. x, 16]. The animal-fable has something of the mystical
   in it and contains deep truth. The attractive and convicting element
   thereof is this inner mysterious fact, that something of the divine
   rules in the animal, and looks out upon us,--a moral element
   unconsciously immanent in nature itself; and that which appears in the
   brute as a type of human sin, is more than a mere fancied
   resemblance,--is in fact the root of that which in man actually becomes
   sin, whereas in the animal it is simply a normal limitedness.

  SECTION CXXIX.

   (2) The actual appropriating of nature-objects for nourishment, and
   thereby at the same time for sensuous enjoyment, involving the
   destruction of living natural objects,--rests upon the moral right of
   man over nature; and the limitations to the enjoyment of the
   nature-objects which serve for food, lie less in the nature-objects
   themselves than in the degree to which they are used and in the moral
   state of the person, as also in the thought of the morally-becoming.
   Also the flesh of animals is allowed to man for food) and hence also
   the killing of the same for such purposes, although in connection
   therewith all cruelty and all wanton levity is to be avoided. The chase
   is moral only in this sense, and not for diversion.--As drink man is
   permitted to use not only the strictly natural fluids, but also such as
   are prepared by skill, including the vinous; it is simply their misuse
   for inebriation that is immoral.

   What things are per se appropriate as means of nourishment, is not a
   moral but a physiological question. Although for the state of
   sinfulness, the disciplinary law of God required man also in this
   sphere to distinguish between clean and unclean, and forbade to him a
   number of per se appropriate means of nourishment, still this law of
   limiting discipline had no validity for humanity while as yet unstained
   by sin. Here are applicable the words of Christ: "Not that which goeth
   into the mouth defileth a man" [Matt. xv, 11; comp. Titus i, 15; Acts
   x, 15; Rom. xiv, 1 sqq. 20; 1 Cor. x, 25 sqq.]. It is not the object
   per se that renders an article of food sinful, but the disposition of
   the eater, the manner of enjoying it,--namely, when one forgets God in
   the sensuous, forgets his own moral dignity in the pleasure, aims not
   at the satisfying of the want, but only at the enjoyment, and does not
   observe the measure prescribed by the purpose of nourishment.

   The admissibility of flesh-food, though very clear from a physiological
   stand-point, has yet been contested from a moral point of view.
   Asceticism has in all ages laid great stress on abstinence from flesh;
   the Indians reject flesh-food unconditionally, inasmuch as, in
   consequence of their Pantheistic philosophy, they regard the
   slaughtering of animals, otherwise than for sacrifice, as a blasphemous
   outrage. [16] The Manichees (and Essenes?) abstained likewise from all
   flesh. The rejection of flesh-food in seasons of fasting has less an
   objective than an inner ground. According to St. Jerome flesh and wine
   were originally not allowed, and were first permitted after the deluge,
   but they are not permissible under Christianity. [17] Paul mentions
   similar views [Rom. xiv, 2]. Jehovah expressly conceded to man after
   the deluge also animals for food [Gen. ix, 3], whereas in the blessing
   after creation [Gen. i, 29] there is mention only of plants as food;
   from this circumstance some have inferred that, previously, flesh-food
   was not in fact allowed; but we find no trace of a previous
   prohibition, and we can discover no reason for a change; rather would
   there lie in the progressive corruption of mankind a reason for a
   limiting of former rights; God's direction to Noah has in fact all the
   appearance of an express confirmation of a former right; and the
   privilege conferred at creation, of ruling over the fish of the sea,
   etc., would hardly have any significance if it did not also include the
   right to eat them. Abel brought offerings of the firstlings of his
   flock and of their fat [Gen. iv, 4]; now as it was uniformly that which
   was most precious to man that was offered as a sacrifice, hence it is
   probable that flocks were kept also for the sake of flesh-food, to
   which in fact the "coats of skins" [Gen. iii, 21] seems to allude. Were
   flesh-food simply a concession to sinfulness, which in fact would have
   no comprehensible reason, it would certainly not be prescribed in
   connection with the Passover and with sacrifices, and above all Christ
   himself would have abstained from it, whereas we know that the contrary
   was the case [Matt. xi, 19; comp. Mark ii, 19; John ii, 2 sqq.; Matt.
   xxvi, 17 sqq.]. Paul declares abstinence from flesh as a weakness of
   faith [Rom. xiv, 2; comp. 21; 1 Cor. x, 25]; to Peter animals are
   expressly offered in a vision for food [Acts 11 sqq.], and animals are
   spoken of as destined to be slaughtered [2 Pet. ii, 12; Deut. xii, 15,
   20]. It is true man can live without flesh, and he certainly has reason
   not needlessly and out of mere wantonness to multiply the destruction
   of animals; still, however, as it is grounded in the very constitution
   of nature that animals serve for food to each other, hence it must be
   allowable also for man to take food for himself out of the animal
   kingdom. And should there seem to lie in the killing of an animal
   something inconsistent with the original peace between man and nature,
   and with man's instinctive feelings, and should it be inferred
   therefrom that it is only the changing of the original relation of
   things, as alluded to in the blessing upon Noah, that rendered
   flesh-food morally possible,--still the force of this difficulty will
   vanish so soon as we reflect upon the very ancient, pious, and
   significant custom,--wide-spread even among heathen nations and
   suggested in the laws of Moses [Lev. xvii, 3 sqq.],--namely, of slaying
   the nobler animals in general only for purposes of sacrifice, and of
   receiving back the flesh, thus consecrated to the Deity, only out of
   His own hand. In regard to the primitive usage it is most probable,
   therefore, that before the deluge the devout children of God partook
   indeed of flesh-food, but only of animals offered in sacrifice, and
   that too only seldom, as indeed pastoral people in general use but
   little flesh-food. Noah might, in view of the sensuality of the
   perished world, have doubted the propriety of flesh-food, and hence God
   sanctions it expressly.

   It is indeed not to be denied that in the practice of the slaying of
   animals in general there lies a moral danger; it tends to blunt our
   feelings of natural compassion; and it is not a mere morbid
   sensibility, that makes it repugnant to some persons, e. g., to wring
   off the head of a dove; moreover it is a well-known fact that those who
   are engaged for the most part in the slaughtering of animals are liable
   to become hardened and cruel; it does not follow from this, however,
   that the slaughtering of animals for food is per se wrong, but only
   that the manner of the slaughtering is not a matter of
   indifference,--that it should be done with the least possible
   suffering, and that not every animal is equally appropriate therefor.
   It is in fact repugnant to our moral feelings to slaughter such
   domestic animals as by their fidelity to and fondness for us, have
   become in some respect our home-companions; it has the look of
   treachery on the part of man,--of a betrayal of the confidence which
   the animal had placed in him, in a word, of a breach of faith. The iron
   necessity of our evil-fraught actual condition may excuse it; but it is
   surely not the proper relation of things; and the fact that the general
   feeling of almost all cultured nations has a horror of the butchering
   of dogs and horses, man's most faithful companions, has its foundation
   surely not in any notion of the unwholesomeness of their flesh, but in
   a very legitimate moral feeling,--a feeling the disregarding of which
   is no mark of a special refinement of culture. Much more natural, and
   less questionably morally, is the killing of wild animals, and of such
   animals of the flock as have not as yet stood to man in a close
   relation of confidence. We cannot here as yet discuss in full the
   subjects of food and drink.

  SECTION CXXX.

   (c) The formative working upon nature, the shaping of it into an organ
   for man, is at the same time also an exalting of nature into the
   service of the moral life, and hence a forming of it into an expression
   of the human spirit,--an educating of nature whereby it is raised above
   its immediate naturalness. and is made to receive the impress of human
   action, of spiritual discipline. Man ennobles, spiritualizes, nature,
   and makes it into his spiritual possession, into his freely-formed
   home,--and in forming nature he appropriates it at the same time to
   himself.

   If the dominating of man over nature,--to which God expressly called
   the first man [Gen. i, 28; Psa. viii], and which still holds good in a
   somewhat modified manner even in the state of sinfulness [Gen. ix, 2,
   3]. and which is promised again in the fullest degree for the yet to be
   recovered perfect state [Isa. xi, 6 sqq.],--is not to be regarded as a
   mere figure of speech, then it must also imply a forming of the same.
   Man forms nature into an obedient instrument of the spirit, and gives
   to it a spiritual, historical impress. Nature, in its wild state,
   stands to man in an unhomelike, not to say hostile relation,--it is
   only in its form as shaped and disciplined by his skill that he feels
   at home. God gave nature to man as a theater for his moral activity,
   but man is not at liberty simply to sport with it, simply to admire and
   enjoy it,--he should really rule over it; but all ruling is at the same
   time an appropriating and a forming. Man is to make of nature something
   which as yet it is not,--is himself to form it into a
   spiritually-molded home for himself. This forming of nature is either a
   forming of it into a useful object for the individual, and hence in the
   service of labor (§ 109), or a forming of it into an image of the
   spirit, into a thing of beauty, into a work of art (§ 110). A hill-side
   cavern is not a dwelling-place for man; his home-protection, he must
   construct for himself. If even the bird builds its nest in a way of its
   own, so that it bears an impress peculiar to the bird, how much more
   must man spiritually shape nature into a home for himself! Of course
   the forming of nature does not consist in an abuse of it,--e. g., in a
   forcing of trees to be square, in cropping the tails of horses and the
   ears of dogs,--but in the further development of the natural beauty and
   perfection already existing in nature. The cultivated rose is more
   beautiful than the wild one; the improved fruit tree is better in many
   respects than the wild-growing one; the domesticated animals have
   become in many respects quite other and more perfect creatures than
   they were in their wild state; they have attained not only to higher
   soul-capacities, but also to a nobler and stronger physique; the wild
   dog and the wild horse cannot in any respect bear favorable comparison
   with those which have been cultivated by man. The fidelity of these
   creatures,--which indeed they show almost exclusively toward man, to
   whom they attach themselves much more closely and affectionately than
   to their own kind,--is an evidence of the normal dominion of spirit
   over nature, and a positive ennobling, and is the thankfulness of the
   animal for its culture.

   The task of overcoming the wild forces of nature that stand in the way
   of individual human life, and of subjecting them to the discipline of
   the spirit, is a powerful stimulus to moral activity; and they are in
   fact, in virtue of the divine creative plan, perfectly overcomable by
   the rational spirit,--if not always by the individual, yet at least by
   the collective, spirit. Though it is not true that all nature-objects
   exist merely for the outward use of man, nevertheless they are in fact
   for man, in a still higher sense,--for his moral delight, for spiritual
   enjoyment, for the service of the moral life. The dominion and
   discipline which man can and should exercise over the animal world,
   does not in the original purpose imply that he is to surround himself
   in his domestic life with animals of every sort, but it does imply that
   he ought not (as, however, has actually taken place) to acknowledge
   them as a power over against himself, and before which he has to
   tremble, and against which he can secure himself only by strategy and
   deadly violence; on the contrary, he should rise to a consciousness of
   his all-sufficient dominating power over them; but to destroy is not to
   dominate. That nature-creatures should become to man a torment, a
   plague, a death-bringing danger, and that man in the interest of his
   self-preservation should have to carry on a war of extermination
   against a large portion of them,--all this is, according to the
   Scripture view, a consequence of the disturbance of the harmony of
   creation; hence, as it is a result of sin, we cannot as yet, here,
   treat of it. Even in the fallen state, however, we can still discover
   clear traces of the true relation of things; even the lion and the
   tiger cannot bear the steady, fearless look of man, and they throw off
   their natural awe of man only after having tasted of human blood. Man
   can and may, however, actually realize his dominion over nature, only
   when he permits himself to be ruled over by the holy Originator and
   Lord of nature.

CHAPTER VI.

  THE FRUIT OF THE MORAL LIFE AS MORAL END.

  SECTION CXXXI.

   The end of moral action, as willed by man as moral, is identical with
   the end of God in man's creation; in this action man wills perfectly to
   realize in himself the image of God,--to develop himself in reality as
   a good being, and thereby to realize the good in general. In so far as
   the good is a fruit of moral action, it is not a something exterior to
   man, but inheres in him,--is his possession, which, as incorporated
   into the morally-formed essence of man himself, and as thenceforth
   inseparable from him, is a property or quality of his person. In so far
   as the good is the property of man, it is his moral estate. Hence, as
   the end of the moral activity in general is the good, so is this end,
   for the moral man himself; the good as having become a moral estate.

   The world is, with its mere creation, not as yet complete, but is
   charged with a task which is to be carried out by moral creatures
   themselves. Though it is true that all good is from God, still all good
   is not from Him immediately; but in man's case it arises through the
   free developing of that which was directly created. Man is himself to
   create good; though as a creature he is good, yet he is not good in
   such a manner as he is to become so; the image of God becomes complete
   in him only through his own moral activity; and he makes into a good
   entity not only himself, but also the world that comes into contact
   with him,--he creates a spiritual historical world which is itself
   good. To this good as created by himself he sustains quite other
   relations than to that which is directly given to him in his natural
   existence. To the first man much good was given, to which he had a
   right, and which he could call his own. This good, however, was simply
   placed upon him,--was as yet external to him, and not as yet identified
   with his spiritual being; he indeed possessed it, but it was not yet
   his property,--was not a quality of his. All that I have in my power,
   upon which I have an actual claim, is my possession. But the idea of
   property is higher; only that is my property which by moral action I
   have appropriated to myself, and which consequently essentially belongs
   to my personal life-sphere, as my free personal acquisition. A merely
   inherited property or power is morally a mere possession, while an
   estate or power that is acquired by labor or is morally developed, is a
   property; in it I have invested my labor, my soul, my will,--it inheres
   in me and in my self-created life-sphere,--is my enlarged personality
   itself. Hence property has always a moral element in it,--is moral
   fruit, is an acquisition. In the case of the first human beings, the
   possession of Eden would have become a property, only in virtue of
   their cultivating and caring for it. A moral property is inalienable;
   it may, as, for example, in the case of a work of art, come into the
   possession of another, but it remains the spiritual property of its
   author. A slave is the possession of his master; but consorts not only
   possess each other,--they appertain to each other,--each is the
   property of the other. Thus in so far as the good becomes and is a
   property, it is a good, a moral estate,--and hence it is such only as a
   fruit of moral action. The good as an outward possession may be lost;
   but when exalted into a moral property, it is permanent; to this Christ
   alludes when he says: "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,"
   etc. [Matt. vi, 19, 20].

  SECTION CXXXII.

   The good to be attained to by moral action is, that perfection which
   answers to the divine creative intention,--on the one hand, the
   perfection of the individual person, and, on the other, that of the
   moral community; that is, it is in part a personal, and in part a
   common good. The two forms mutually condition each other, and stand
   with each other in constant and closest relation; but both are further
   conditioned on the moral communion with God which is aimed at by the
   moral activity, and which is the highest moral goal as well as the
   ground and essence of all creature-perfection in general; for God alone
   is the eternally-perfect good. The real moral life-communion with God,
   as distinguished from the merely natural, is consequently the absolute
   good, and hence the highest good,--that which is the source and
   condition of all other goods. In so far as individual man has the
   highest good as his moral property, he is a child of God; in so far as
   the moral community has this good inherent in itself, it is the kingdom
   of God, which rests on the God-sonship of its individual members.

   The thought of a moral communion, and hence also of a moral
   common-good, is met with also in the extra-Christian world; the
   Republic of Plato was meant to embody it. But where the common ground
   of the personal good as well as of the common good, namely, communion
   with God, is lacking, there this thought is realizable only as a sum
   total of single goods, or only by the all-dominating despotism of the
   community-organism over the individuals, as in the system of Plato. A
   vital union of the two forms of good is effected only by the Christian
   God-consciousness. Some form of communion with God is enjoyed by every
   creature as such; this, however, is of a merely natural character, and
   needs, in the case of rational creatures, to be exalted to a moral
   character. As coming from the hands of nature man is not the child of
   God; he becomes truly such only by free moral love to God.

   The question as to the highest good,--for the heathen difficult and in
   fact not truly solvable at all,--is, from an evangelically-moral
   stand-point, readily answerable. There is absolutely no good realizable
   or actually realized without standing in relation to God, without
   springing from God as its source, and hence none for man without
   personal life-communion with God [John xvii, 21; 1 John i, 3; ii, 5, 6]
   who is the perfectly good One in an absolute sense [Matt. xix, 17];
   only he has the highest good who is rich toward God [Luke xii, 21; Psa.
   lxxiii, 25], and who has everlasting treasures in heaven [Matt. vi, 20;
   1 Tim. vi, 19]. While heathen philosophers grope about in uncertainty
   as to the highest good, Jehovah reveals it in all simplicity and
   definiteness to the patriarch Abraham at a time when he was wavering in
   faith as to the fulfillment of the prophecies made to him,--reveals it
   in these words: "I am thy exceeding great reward" [Gen. xv, 1],--thou
   canst aim at and attain to nothing higher; and the highest blessing of
   the Old Testament is the "peace of God" [Num. vi, 26; Psa. xxix, 11].
   This highest good man cannot have as a merely outward possession, as a
   mere gift,--he cannot have it from nature, but only as a
   morally-acquired property; even under the economy of redemption from
   sin, where not merit but grace prevails, faith which is in fact a moral
   work--is the necessary condition. The idea of a kingdom of
   God,--unknown throughout heathendom, but prepared for and anticipated
   in the Old Testament, and realized in Christianity,--presents the moral
   community as in full possession of the highest good, which now becomes,
   in turn, for the individual members (by whom it is enjoyed as
   God-sonship) the source of higher moral perfection. In virtue of
   life-communion with God the highest good bears the stamp of eternity,
   in the sense of endless duration; the life of the children of God is an
   everlasting life [Matt. xix, 16, 17, 29; xxv, 46; John xvii, 3; 1 John
   ii, 25, and other texts], and the kingdom of God is an everlasting
   kingdom.

I. THE PERSONAL PERFECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS THE END OF THE MORAL ACTIVITY.

  SECTION CXXXIII.

   The personal perfection of the individual person is the realization and
   virtualization of God-sonship, that is, of the idea of man, and of the
   creative will of God as to man. The moral goal set before man, namely,
   the all-sided personal perfection of the human life-powers and of their
   manifestation, is, as a fruit of the collective moral activity, never
   fully and definitively realized during the temporal life, but is
   involved in constant progress, though at every stage of the truly moral
   life it is in fact relatively realized.

   To be perfect is neither an improper nor an impossible requirement upon
   man; on the contrary, it is expressly presented by Christ and the
   apostles as the moral goal: "Be ye therefore perfect (teleioi) even as
   your Father which is in heaven is perfect" [Matt. v, 48]; "if thou wilt
   be perfect, follow me" [xix, 21; Luke vi, 40; 1 Cor. ii, 6; xiv, 20;
   Eph. iv, 13; Col. i, 28; 2 Tim. iii, 17; Heb. v, 14; James iii, 2]; the
   term teleios implies the contents of telos, that is, the purpose and
   goal of the moral life. This perfection of the creature is indeed, as
   compared with the divine perfection, of a limited character; such as it
   is, however, it really exists, in every case of normal development,
   from the very first moment on, and it steadily advances, keeping pace
   with every stage of the life-development. Christ himself, even as a
   child, is presented as a pattern, while as yet he was increasing in
   wisdom and in favor with God and man; that is, he was even as a child
   perfect, though this perfection was not yet that of the full man's-age
   of Christ [Eph. iv, 13]. Every moral being should and can be relatively
   perfect at every moment of its life; even the child is to be so in the
   manner of a child [1 Cor. xiii, 11]; and the final and true perfection
   is not a merely conceived and never-to-be-realized goal, for such would
   not be a goal at all, but it can in fact and should actually be
   realized by each and all. Christ as the son of man really reached this
   goal, and all who belong to him have, in virtue of their God-sonship,
   both the duty and the possibility of attaining to it [Phil. iii, 12,
   15; 1 Cor. xiii, 10].

  SECTION CXXXIV.

   All moral attainments, and hence all the elements and forms of
   perfection or of the true good, are a moral possession, and hence a
   property. Every possession is an enlargement of the existence, the
   power and the life-sphere of the moral person, in virtue of moral
   appropriation,--is a breaking down of the limits of the original
   individuality, a uniting of the isolated existence with the life of the
   whole. Corresponding to the distinction between special and general
   appropriating (§ 104), and, from another point of view, to that between
   natural and spiritual appropriating (§ 101), the possession acquired by
   moral appropriating (which is at the same time necessarily also a
   forming) is, on the one hand, partly of a more external
   character,--bearing upon the individual as such and widening his
   life-sphere, and hence, as relating to others, of an exclusive
   character,--and, on the other, in part of a more inward, spiritual and,
   in so far, not merely personal, character, but, on the contrary,
   promotive of communion.

   (a) The outward possession-legal property, temporal means--is, as the
   fruit of moral labor, a real and legitimate good, and hence also a
   legitimate end of moral effort, though it becomes at once sinful when
   it is made the end per se, the highest good itself, when it is placed
   above the inward possession and not rather vitally united with it, when
   the effort for it aims merely at the enjoyment and not. also at the
   moral culture and the moral communion naturally involved in it,--when
   it does not become a channel of communicative love.

   If appropriating is per se a moral activity, then is also the striving
   after temporal possessions not only a right but also a duty.
   Possessions distinguish man from the brute, and civilized man from the
   savage; the Diogenic form of wisdom is by no means very profound. Labor
   finds in possessions its normal fruit; possessions are labor as having
   become reality. The brute is possessionless because he does not labor.
   In property man ceases to be a mere isolated individual of his species;
   he creates for himself a world about himself which he can call his own;
   his property is the outward manifestation of his inward peculiarity.
   The fact that he who possesses much is also much regarded and esteemed
   in the world, is, indeed, often very hollow and baseless, though in
   reality it springs from the per se correct consciousness that
   possessions are the fruit of labor,--the result of moral effort. He who
   acquires nothing for himself passes in the world, not without reason,
   for unrespectable. Of a special virtue of possession-despising, as with
   the mendicant monks, there can, in the ante-sinful state, be no
   question; and even after the fall, possessions are presented as a
   perfectly legitimate end of moral effort, and their being increased as
   a special divine blessing. Cain and Abel possess already personal
   property; and the God-blessed possessions of the patriarchs occupy a
   very large place in their morally-religious life [Gen. xii. 5, 16;
   xiii, 2; xiv, 14; xxiv, 22, 35, 53; xxvi, 13, 14; xxvii, 28; xxx, 27,
   30, 43; xxxi, 42; xxxii, 5, 10, 13 sqq.; xxxiii, 11; xxxix, 5; xlix,
   25; Exod. xxiii, 25; Lev. xxv, 21; Deut. ii, 7; vii, 13; xv, 14 sqq.;
   xvi, 15, 17; xxviii, 3 sqq.; xxxiii, 13 sqq.; xxiv, 25; comp. 1 Kings
   iii, 13; Psa. cvii, 38; cxii, 2, 3; cxxxii, 15].

   Property being the enlarged life-sphere of the moral person,--in some
   sense his enlarged personality itself,--the moral phase thereof lies
   not merely in its antecedent ground, namely, labor, but also in its
   moral use and application. To its enjoyment man has a moral right, as
   such enjoyment is the reward of labor; but to the exclusive enjoyment
   of it for himself alone he has no moral right, seeing that he is bound
   to other men by love, and love manifests itself in communicative
   distribution.

  SECTION CXXXV.

   (b) The inner possession, namely, the perfection of the personality
   itself in its essence and life,--perfectly realized in the person of
   the Son of man alone,--is,

   (1) The perfection of knowledge, namely, wisdom; that is, that
   all-sided knowledge of God which rests on a true love of God, and which
   in virtue of moral effort has become a true property of the person, and
   which consequently also constitutes a life-power determinative in turn
   of the moral life itself,--and hence involving also a knowledge of the
   being, essence, and end of created reality, especially also of one's
   own life (§§ 60, 104). As influencing the moral life, wisdom is
   necessarily also practical; and as taking into view the actual
   circumstances of existence and their application to the moral end, it
   assumes the form of prudence.

   Wisdom is presented in the Scriptures as the first and most essential
   element of the highest good, and in fact always under its two phases,
   as a knowledge of the truth, and as power to fulfill it. It is not a
   mere knowledge in which man forgets himself in the object, not mere
   science, but a knowledge which merges the person himself into the life
   of the truth,--which fills the soul with vital, life-creating truth.
   The object of wisdom is not this or that particular truth, but the
   truth,--is the self-consistent complete whole. Knowledge is not yet
   wisdom; with scantier knowledge there may be more wisdom than with a
   richer knowledge; a much-knowing one may even be a great fool. Wisdom
   is essentially not world-science but God-science; it is, as a
   manifestation of God-sonship, never without a life in God,--is in its
   essence piety; without God-knowledge and God-fearing there can be only
   folly [Psa. cxi, 10; xxv, 14; Job xxviii, 28; Prov. i, 7; ix, 10].
   Wisdom is more than knowledge and science, inasmuch as it always aims
   at unity, at the central point, at the whole,--always unites the person
   himself with God and with the All, both cognoscitively and actively; it
   is moral knowing. Its essence consists not in the compass and in the
   fullness of the knowledge, but in the harmony, the true foundation, the
   truth and the moral potency of that which is known. There is no wisdom,
   therefore, without constant moral effort; but also none which does not
   itself produce a moral life. Such wisdom is presented as the most
   essential element of the highest good, and to acquire it, as a high
   duty [Prov. ii, 2 sqq.; iv, 5 sqq.; viii, 11; xvi, 16; xxiii, 23; John
   viii, 32; xvii, 3; Acts xvii, 27; Rom. xii, 2; xvi, 19; 1 Cor. xiv, 20;
   Eph. i, 18; iii, 18; iv, 13; v, 10, 17; Phil. i, 9, 10; iii, 8; iv, 8,
   9; Col. i, 9, 11; iii, 10, 16; 1 Tim. ii, 4; 1 Pet. iii, 15; 2 Pet.
   iii, 18; James i, 5], and the non-recognizing of the divine as deep
   guilt [Rom. i, 20, 21; iii, 11; 1 Cor. i, 21; 2 Tim. iii, 7; 2 Thess.
   i, 8]. Wisdom associates all knowledge with God, and uses it all in
   moral self-revelation,--is pious and moral at the same time,--goes back
   always to the primitive ground, and forward to the ultimate end; hence
   it leaves nothing in its isolation and separateness, but brings all
   things, man included, into relation to the whole, and the whole into
   relation to every part; it is knowing in its truly rational character;
   the fear of the Lord, it is wisdom.--As wisdom makes knowledge the full
   property of the person,--as it belongs not merely to the understanding
   but also to the heart, and is in fact intelligent love,--hence it is
   necessarily also active life,--begets love and works from love, awakens
   a striving to manifest the attained truth in the reality of life. A
   wisdom which does not generate life,--which remains locked up in the
   subject,--is folly [Deut. iv, 6; Prov. viii, 11 sqq.; James iii, 13,
   17].

   Prudence (phronesis, different from sophia, Eph. i, 8) is indeed in the
   sphere of sinful humanity not identical with wisdom, and can even exist
   as a merely worldly quality apart therefrom; but where sin is not yet
   actual, this difference is merely formal. Wisdom, as essential
   rationality itself, embraces truth per se as a harmonious whole;
   prudence, on the contrary, takes into account actual reality with a
   view to bringing it into relation to the moral idea as embraced by
   reason,--in order to find for the moral idea its realization in each
   conjuncture, and the means thereto; hence it is simply wisdom as
   relating to specific real circumstances. Hence true prudence can
   neither exist without wisdom, nor wisdom without prudence, and moral
   duty involves both of them in inseparable unity. The harmonizing of
   prudence with open-hearted simplicity becomes difficult only in a world
   of sin. Considerateness and circumspectness are designations of
   prudence as applied in cases difficult of decision [Luke xiv, 28, 29],
   especially in so far as it guards against the promptings of over-rash
   feelings.

  SECTION CXXXVI.

   (2) The perfection of feeling, as a moral fruit, is the feeling of pure
   pleasure in the divine, and of unmitigated repugnance to the ungodly,
   and, as based on faith, the feeling of pure joy which springs from the
   consciousness of the morally-wrought harmony of one's own existence
   with God and with the universe. As relating to existence other than
   that of the moral subject, this perfection is perfect love as a power
   grown essential and inherent in the personality; in relation to the
   moral subject himself it is the perfect bliss of the child of God, the
   repose of the soul in God.

   So long as the feeling of self is not yet reduced to full harmony with
   the love of God (§ 92), so long also is feeling, as relating to the
   godly and the ungodly, not pure and not decided. As the ear must first
   be made skillful by attentiveness and practice in order to be able
   readily to distinguish beautiful from discordant notes, so also must
   feeling, first be made sensitive by moral exercise in order to be able,
   at every moment, unhesitatingly to love and to hate at once in the
   right manner. Such decisiveness, such purity of feeling, constitutes an
   essential part of the perfection of the life in God, that is, of
   blessedness; blessed are they who are pure of heart; blessed they who
   find no occasion of offense in Christ and in the ways of God [Matt. xi,
   6.] Mere joy is not yet blessedness; the merely natural pleasure in
   existence, even were it of a Paradisaical character, is not enough to
   satisfy the spiritual nature of man; only that which is morally
   wrought, or at least morally appropriated, renders blessed. Even a
   normal child rejoices more in its own playful creating than in mere
   eating and drinking. The nine Beatitudes of Christ [Matt. v] relate,
   all of them, to the moral, and not one of them to a mere state of
   enjoyment. All blessedness, however, is love, and true love is
   blessedness; but only morally attained love is true love; even love to
   God becomes truly blissful only when it is the expression of
   already-attained God-Sonship. The moral man feels blissful when he
   views the harmony of being not as simply immediately existing and as
   merely contemplated by himself, but as in moral freedom recognized,
   willed, and realized by himself,--namely, in so far as, on the one
   hand, those features in the objective world which are originally as yet
   exterior and uncongenial to man are overcome, and the dominion of man
   over nature realized, and in so far as, on the other, a spiritually
   moral world is brought into being with which the individual knows
   himself in moral harmony; but the consciousness of this double harmony
   produces loving blessedness only when it rests on the consciousness of
   a morally virtualized filial relation to God. True blessedness exists
   only in union with God; peace of soul only in the eternal.

   That such blessedness is not simply an inheritance in the future but
   the destination even of the present life, is implied in the moral idea
   itself, as well as in the thought of the divine love. God has not
   appointed us unto wrath, but to obtain blessedness [1 Thess. v, 9];
   "but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
   therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
   man shall be blessed in his deed" [James i, 25]; though this thought
   may hold good on the part of one redeemed by grace, only under certain
   limitations, yet it is unconditionally valid of man per se and as
   unfallen; with him moral activity is per se blessedness, and there is
   no blessedness without moral activity. "Blessed are they that hear the
   word of God and keep it" [Luke xi, 28],--keep it not merely in memory
   but in their heart, in love and in volition; "blessed are they that do
   his commandments" [Rev. xxii, 14].

  SECTION CXXXVII.

   (3) The perfection of the moral will, that is, the full moral freedom
   of self-determination as effected by wisdom and love, the perfect
   mastery over one's self, the completed possession of one's self,
   constitutes the fully developed personal character. As distinguished
   from all mere fortuitous character-forming, the truly moral character
   is the copy of the divine holiness as attained to through free moral
   culture,--the moral law as become the real free property of man, the
   harmony of the human with the divine will as become a dominant power, a
   moral nature, so that consequently the willing and accomplishing of the
   ungodly becomes to man a moral impossibility,--so that the love to God
   becomes perfect hatred against sin. The constantly advancing
   development of the moral striving toward this holiness, constitutes the
   ever-progressive sanctification of the soul, the ultimate fruit of
   which is the perfect freedom of the will, and as contained therein the
   enjoyment of blessedness.

   In that the moral activity becomes fact, that is, becomes a moral
   possession of the person, it transforms the original, as yet,
   undetermined will-freedom into a determined moral will-quality, into
   moral character. Character-formation illustrates clearly the nature of
   moral freedom. An, as yet, undetermined character has a much wider
   possibility of choice in single cases than a definitely shaped one; a
   characterless man is unreliable because his freedom has no moral
   determinedness, but is merely external freedom of choice. Character is
   reliable, and upon the degree of its firmness rests the confidence
   which it inspires; we know in advance with certainty how, in a definite
   moral conjuncture, such and such a character will choose. This is now
   surely no limitation of freedom, but rather its moral maturity. The
   freedom is all the more perfect, true, and mature, the more it is
   character-firm, the more it has moral determinedness; and the highest
   moral freedom is that where the person can no longer waver in any moral
   question, where it has become for him a moral impossibility to choose
   the immoral,--and this is the state of holiness. Holiness is related to
   innocence as morally-acquired good to ante-moral natural good--as moral
   property to mere possession.

   Human holiness as a copy of the divine holiness differs from the latter
   in this, that with God holiness constitutes his essence itself, and the
   possibility of sin is not in any sense conceivable; whereas human
   holiness is simply a morally-acquired good, and presupposes the
   possibility of sin, which in fact it has morally overcome. God's
   holiness is eternal; human holiness is, in its true character, the goal
   of development,--depends on progressive sanctification, which advances
   from a mere non-willing of the sinful to hatred against it and to
   abhorrence of it. The moral requirement of complete heart-purity and
   holiness may not in any manner be lowered, as if a limited measure
   thereof were enough, and as if a lower requirement were to be made of
   feebly constituted man than, e. g., of the angels. According to the
   testimony of Christ, men are in fact to become equal to the angels
   [isangeloi, Luke xx, 36]; and also in their moral essence they should
   and must not remain below them. Man ought (and the word ought expresses
   the fundamental condition of all morality in general) to become morally
   perfect, and hence holy. This requirement is fully maintained even in
   the state of sinfulness, where primarily, that is, before the
   completion of redemption, the entire fulfilling of the same was not
   possible. The legislation from Sinai places this moral requirement, as
   the fundamental idea of morality, in great prominence: "Ye shall be
   holy, for I am holy, the Lord your God" [Lev. xi, 44, 45; xix, 2; xx,
   7]; and the apostles adopt the same words as fully valid also for
   Christians [1 Pet. i, 15, 16]. The utterances of the Scriptures
   elsewhere fully harmonize therewith [Eph. i, 4; iv, 24; 1 Thess. iii,
   13; comp. Matt. v, 48; Luke i, 75; and other passages], and the fact
   that the faithful of God are so frequently styled "saints" is clearly
   an expression of their moral destination.

   Man is originally innocent, but not yet holy; he is not, however, to
   remain merely innocent, but is to advance to real holiness. Man is
   created in innocence unto holiness. The mere unconscious retaining of
   the first innocence would be a lingering in the child-consciousness;
   and the going beyond it,--not of course in the direction of sin but
   only in that of conscious holiness,--was the true normal course;
   Christ's holiness was not mere innocence. As a morally-acquired
   property, holiness as distinguished from the mere possession of
   innocence, is a permanent quality, and constitutes the moral character
   itself of man; he for whom there is yet possible a single sinful
   moment, has not yet attained to holiness. There is not only a natural
   but also a moral must; and when the child Jesus says: "Wist ye not that
   I must be about my Father's business?" [Luke ii, 49], this is a direct
   reference to this moral "must" of a holy soul. Holiness is consequently
   not a quality of single actions, but it is character-peculiarity; not
   the single volitional act, the single frame of mind is holy, but the
   heart itself. This purity of heart is not a merely negative state, a
   mere non-presence of sin, for that would be only innocence, but it is a
   moral fruit, a morally-acquired power over sin, and hence where sin has
   once actually existed it cannot be attained to by a mere ceasing to
   sin, but only by ceaselessly militant santification. Sanctification
   (hagiasmos) is consequently by no means a merely negative bearing, even
   in the ante-sinful state, but is a positive forming of the will and
   heart unto holiness. The sanctification mentioned in the Scriptures [1
   Cor. i, 30; 2 Cor. vii, 1; 1 John iii, 3; Heb. xii, 14, and other
   passages] designates of course only the putting off of existing
   sinfulness as taking place in virtue of redemption; but when Christ
   says of himself: "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also
   might be sanctified through the truth" [John xvii, 19], this
   self-sanctification of the holy One is indeed primarily to be
   understood of his giving himself in sacrifice, but it alludes at the
   same time also to the perfecting of the moral life-development of the
   Son of Man unto the plenary possession of morally-acquired holiness in
   his character as man; such sanctification is the duty of man as man.

   Through progressive sanctifying culture of the will man becomes
   perfectly master over his heart, over his will,--the moral becomes easy
   to him, becomes his second nature, whereas his first nature is the as
   yet not morally formed one. The will of the person is now no longer
   different from the divine will, but it is, in full freedom, at one
   therewith; the divine will has fully become the inner essence and the
   vital power of the disposition of the person, not merely in general but
   also in particular, so that in each special case the will with
   unfailing certainty chooses the right,--even as a true artist possesses
   full mastery over his hand, so that it never introduces a false tone or
   makes a false stroke. Practice leads to mastery; and the
   morally-matured man is master over his own will.

   It is only in this mastery that man is truly free, namely, in that he
   has then overcome every thing in himself which, as a
   morally-to-be-mastered material, was as yet different from the moral
   idea itself. But freedom is bliss; he who has become truly free in his
   will is thereby necessarily also happy. Master over himself, he is also
   at the same time master over all that is unspiritual, over nature; and
   in having put himself into complete and free harmony with God, he
   participates in the lordship of the absolute Spirit over nature. "The
   Father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works," says Christ in
   reference to his miraculous works--the works of the Spirit upon nature;
   "verily, verily," says Christ to his disciples, "he that believeth on
   me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall
   he do" [John xiv, 10, 12]; for God who dwells in him, as he in God, the
   same does the works; having become free in God, man has nothing more
   either within or without himself which could prove a hinderance to the
   moral will of the rational spirit,--which would say, No! to the
   striving of the Holy Spirit; as an expression of true and complete
   freedom, and not as the caprice of the immature and unsanctified
   spirit, this promise of Christ holds good for all his faithful
   followers. The hard rind of unspiritual nature must be broken through,
   the longing of the vanity-bound creature must be fulfilled; nature must
   be "delivered from the bondage of corruption unto the glorious liberty
   of the children of God" [Rom. viii, 19-22]; all that is natural must be
   spiritualized, must be exalted into the complete untrammeled service of
   the free spirit; such is the freedom, such the blessedness of the
   children of God.

   In the possession of knowledge, of purified feeling, and of the mastery
   of the will, as attained to by moral appropriating and self-forming,
   man becomes morally cultured, as distinguished from the as yet morally
   immature and crude man; and in such culture he is truly free. The very
   first man was called unto perfect culture, and it is quite the opposite
   of correct to conceive, with Rousseau, the first human beings as living
   in a state of happy barbarism. As far back as the Biblical account
   reaches we find even in the state of sin no trace of an actual
   cultureless barbarism. The fact that Adam was to till his garden was of
   itself an implication of his destination to culture, for barbarians
   never till the soil; Adam's sons appear, from the very first, as
   persons of culture with a definite savagery-excluding- calling; Cain
   was a founder of villages [Gen. iv, 17]; and among his immediate
   descendants appear inventors of manifold articles of skill [Gen. iv,
   21, 22]; and from that time forth we find traces of a progressive
   culture. The progenitors of the Israelites are by no means half-savage
   nomads; their wandering-about is only a temporary state of necessity,
   for they are in search of a home; and their entire form of life gives
   evidence indeed of great simplicity, but yet also of high spiritual and
   moral culture. True culture is always a fruit of moral effort, and a
   culture that aims at mere temporal enjoyment and profit is but a
   deceptive self-defeating counterfeit.

  SECTION CXXXVIII.

   (c) In that the morally-good becomes an acquired possession of man, his
   real property, it has become an essential element of his moral nature,
   and hence is not an inert state, but an active power generative of new
   moral life,--has become a creative, operative disposition, and is
   consequently itself per se a directly active motive to moral action.
   The morally-good has become virtue, which is accordingly, on the one
   hand, a good not innate and embraced in the nature itself of man, but a
   morally-acquired possession, and on the other a power generative in
   turn itself of the good.

   "All Scripture, given by inspiration of God, is also profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
   unto all good works" [2 Tim. iii, 16, 17]; the moral perfection
   attained to by the sanctifying activity is itself in turn a stimulus to
   the good, a capacitation, a skilledness and power for moral activity;
   such is the inner idea of virtue. Man as come into possession of virtue
   is no longer the original man possessed of merely naturally-moral
   power, but he is man as armed with morally acquired and hence
   heightened power. There are no innate virtues, but only innate
   capabilities of virtue. The merely natural man has moral freedom as a
   simple and as yet undetermined freedom of choice; the virtuous man has
   his freedom as exalted to a determinedness for the good; he has no
   longer an equally balanced choice between good and evil, but his
   morally acquired peculiarity of character inclines spontaneously to the
   good. Man can never merely possess virtue, he must let it be operative;
   a dormant virtue is none at all. Hence, varying from the usual view
   which distinguishes and contrasts goods and virtues, we consider virtue
   directly as a good. The contrasting of virtue as a power and of goods
   as a possession is inaccurate; all power is a good, and every good is a
   heightening of power; hence men of the world seek so zealously after
   earthly goods, as they thereby enlarge their power. That virtue is not
   a dormant possession, but strictly an operative power, does not make it
   differ essentially from all other goods; no real property exists merely
   to lie idle, no talent is to be buried; but it is to be put to usury
   and made constantly to acquire more. Money is a good; for him, however,
   who does not put it to use, it does not really exist; it becomes a real
   good only when it becomes a power, when it is employed in heightened
   life-activity. Virtue, however, is a much higher good than that which
   is given us directly and from nature, or as an outward possession.

   In the New Testament the notion of virtue is variously expressed; arete
   [Phil. iv, 8; 1 Peter ii, 9; 2 Peter i, 3, 5] is not strictly virtue,
   but is rather the notion of the morally good in general. Usually the
   notion of virtue is expressed by dikaiosune, in so far as this quality
   is a personal possession [Luke i, 75; Rom. vi, 13; Eph. iv, 24; v, 9,
   and other passages], also by hagiosune [1 Thess. iii, 13], by
   agathosune [Rom. xv, 14; Eph. v, 9], and likewise also by eusebeia, in
   so far as the root of virtue rather than virtue itself is meant; for
   Christian virtue, charisma is also used, as designating its resting
   upon divine grace. In the Old Testament the notion proper of virtue is
   wanting; under the predominance of the thought of the law and of right,
   the morally correct character is designated as "righteousness," in
   virtue of its answering to the law and claims of God; hence this is
   merely a designation of the form. Before the full accomplishment of
   redemption, the inner essence of virtue was neither fully realizable
   nor comprehensible.

  SECTION CXXXIX.

   Inasmuch as all moral motive consists in love (§ 91), and inasmuch as
   virtue, as a moral property, is also an actuating power, hence virtue
   is essentially love to God, and is consequently per se not multiple but
   single. In so far, however, as the relation of this one-fold virtue may
   be different both as to the moral person and as to the object, it
   appears under the form of a plurality of virtues, which, however, as
   merely different phases and manifestation-forms of the one virtue, are
   never to be entirely separated from each other, and can never exist
   alone. These diverse manifestation-forms of virtue may be reduced to
   four cardinal virtues:--(1) Moral love preserves itself for the object
   in its proper relation to it, and thus manifests itself in the virtue
   of fidelity.--(2) Moral love preserves the object in its moral rights,
   and hence in its legitimate peculiarity,--as the virtue of
   justness.--(3) Moral love preserves the moral subject himself in his
   moral rights, and hence at the same time within his moral limits, in
   that it places upon the moral activity of the same a definite
   measure,--the virtue of temperateness.--(4) Moral love preserves at
   once both itself, the moral object and the moral subject in their moral
   rights, in that it actively opposes all hinderances that stand in the
   way of it and of its realization,--the virtue of courage.

   We do not adopt the Platonic classification of the virtues which has
   found its way into a large portion of works on Christian ethics, for it
   is only by violence that it can be accommodated to the Christian
   consciousness. The cardinal virtues which we adopt, result logically
   and naturally from the notion of love as a disposition of the soul; and
   it is, by no means, accidental that they correspond to the four
   temperaments. The so-called temperament-virtues are simply the natural
   germs of the real virtues. The virtue of courage corresponds to the
   warm or choleric temperament; that of temperateness to the cold or
   phlegmatic; that of justness to the quick or sanguine,--for sanguine
   persons are very receptive for whatever is objective, accepting it just
   as it presents itself, yielding themselves to it, doing it no violence;
   sanguine persons are very companionable. The virtue of fidelity
   corresponds to the melancholic temperament, which, directed inwardly
   and dwelling within itself, and largely closed to outward influences,
   is not easily led astray.--The four virtues are so intimately connected
   with each other that each contains within itself in some measure all
   the others. Temperateness is justness in so far as it restrains man
   from that which does not become him; it is fidelity in so far as it
   regards love to God and to God's will as having the highest claims, and
   does not allow the individual self to become too prominent; and it is
   courage in so far as it actively confines the unspiritual and the
   irrational within their proper limits. Justness is fidelity in so far
   as it preserves love for and verifies it upon the object; it is
   temperateness in so far as it respects every-where the measure and the
   limits of the moral person and of the object; and it is courage in so
   far as it carries out and vindicates the just. Fidelity is courage in
   so far as it asserts itself in the active overcoming of all
   hinderances; it is justness in so far as it manifests to the object
   only the measure of love which is really felt for it; and for the same
   reason it is temperateness. Temperateness and fidelity correspond to
   each other in so far as they both retain the moral person in a proper
   bearing in relation to the object; justness and courage correspond to
   each other in so far as they both resist all influences that are
   unfriendly to the moral. Temperateness and courage are purely human
   virtues in so far as both presuppose a creature-limit of the moral
   personality, and hence they can in no sense be predicated of God;
   fidelity and justness are also divine virtues [1 John i, 9] because
   they presuppose only a difference of the personal subject from the
   object, and a claim of the moral. The former two have in their
   manifestation a negating character,--presuppose an antagonism in which
   one phase must be made subordinate; the latter two bear a more
   affirmative character,--are an express recognition and carrying out of
   the moral rights of the object. Of a conflicting of the virtues. with
   each other there is no possibility.

   Of the cardinal virtues here presented, three coincide with the
   Platonic virtues; but in the place of wisdom our classification gives
   fidelity. With the Greeks the making of wisdom the fundamental virtue
   was quite consequential; for all the other virtues were a fruit of
   moral knowledge, but not of love. From a Christian stand-point, where
   the moral freedom of the will is conceived more highly and is not
   placed in so unconditional a relation of dependence upon knowledge as
   with the Greeks, and where, consequently, virtue inheres essentially in
   the love-inspired will, wisdom is indeed conceived as a high
   morally-to-be-acquired good, as the presupposition and attendant of all
   virtue, and is also in fact closely associated with love, (§ 135), but
   still it cannot be regarded as a virtue proper. The first and most
   essential manifestation-form of virtue as love is persistent love,
   namely, fidelity, which consequently cannot be classified under any one
   of the other virtues as a subordinate manifestation, but it must be
   placed at the head, as the virtue dominating all the others.

   (1) Fidelity (pistis), thrown very much into the background in heathen
   ethics, for the reason that, there, the absolutely firm basis of all
   morality, faith in the true God, was lacking, comes in the Christian
   consciousness into the foreground. Human virtue, as lasting love, is an
   image of the divine fidelity, which is presented in the Scriptures as
   one of the most prominent of the divine attributes, and is almost
   always associated with love, grace, and mercy [Gen. ix, 9 sqq.; Exod.
   xxxiv, 6; Deut. vii, 9; ix, 5; xxxii, 4; 1 Sam. xii, 22; Psa. lxxxvi,
   15; 1 Cor. i, 9; x, 13; 1 Thess. v, 24; 2 Thess. iii, 3; 2 Tim. ii,
   13]. God's fidelity is loving grace; the fidelity of man is humble
   obedience, and is hence a manifestation of piety,--is, in ground and
   essence, fidelity toward the faithful God [Matt. xxv, 21; 1 Cor. iv,
   2]; the holy walk of the Christian is summed up in the word: "Be thou
   faithful unto death" [Rev. ii, 10; comp. Psa. lxxxv, 11, 12; Matt. x,
   22; Luke xvi, 10-12; 1 Cor. vii, 25].--True fidelity relates not to a
   mere idea, to a mere law, but to a spiritual reality, and chiefly to
   the personal spirit; love loves only a loving spirit. A merely
   conceived law cannot be loved; hence there can be no real fidelity to
   such, which is not in reality fidelity to the holy law-giver. Fidelity
   toward man is morally without anchor unless it is based on fidelity to
   God; for fidelity can be based only on a perfectly firm foundation.
   Fidelity to a creature in the absence of fidelity to God, would not be
   a virtue but sin. Fidelity is the truthfulness of love; a changing love
   is mere inclination, and is not moral; truth changes not, and hence
   also moral love changes not.--As relating to industrial activity in a
   temporal calling, fidelity appears as diligence, which is only then
   morally good, and hence a virtue, when it is a conscious persistence in
   our God-appointed moral task [Prov. x, 4; xii, 27; 1 Thess. iv, 11].

   (2) Justness or righteousness is the constant willingness to the actual
   recognition of the rights of every moral personality, as well those of
   God as those of man; it is love in the fulfilling of the command:
   "Render unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the
   things that are God's" [Matt. xxii, 21],--the imitating of the
   righteousness of God which gives to each that which is his due. In the
   Scriptures justness or righteousness is one of the most important of
   the moral notions, and it appears even in its widest sense as the
   respecting of the suum cuique; it is a manifestation of love, and a
   never fully to be absolved debt [Rom. xiii, 8]; and in so far as it is
   a manifestation of reciprocal love it is thankfulness (§ 125). It is
   for the reason that justness lovingly fulfills the claims of God that
   it can lay claim to the essence of virtue in general; it is virtue in
   so far as virtue is a disposition of soul recognizing the claims of God
   upon us. Christ sums up all our moral relations to our fellows under
   the one head, justness, and makes of this, in its fuller sense. the
   fundamental idea of morality: "All things whatsoever ye would that men
   should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the
   prophets" [Matt. vii, 12]; this is not merely ordinary civil justice,
   but the higher,--that which is an expression of love. But all love
   seeks to maintain the harmony of existence, and hence the divine order
   of the world, that is, the rights of whatever truly is; and all human
   justness is a copy of the divine [Deut. x, 17, 18.]

   Justness adapts itself to the differences of existence and of rights;
   God has different rights from those of man, and among men there exist,
   even in an unfallen state, different rights, according to their
   differing conditions and relations; parents have different rights from
   those of the children, governors from those of the governed; justness
   gives not to each the same, but to each that which is his due [Rom.
   xiii, 7-9], and thus realizes the harmony of existence. Even toward
   nature there is a justness, inasmuch as nature, in virtue of its being
   good, has a claim upon the moral spirit (§ 127). Real justness
   therefore presupposes wisdom; its practice becomes difficult, however,
   only where the harmony of existence is already disturbed by sin. The
   Scriptures describe justness manifoldly in its single manifestations
   [e. g. Lev. xix; Job xxxi; Psa. xv; ci; Ezek. xviii, 6-9; Isa. i, 17;
   Jer. xxii, 3; Zech. vii, 9, 10; viii, 16, 17; Luke vi, 38]; the
   Decalogue itself is but a description thereof. That Christian justness
   or righteousness is not a merely human virtue but essentially a gift of
   grace, need here only to be mentioned in passing. As virtue simply and
   purely, it appears only in the person of Christ [1 John ii, 1, 29; Acts
   iii, 14; 1 Pet. iii, 18].

   (3) Temperateness, the self-discipline of the heart, the sophrosune of
   the Greeks, is presented in the New Testament in the narrower sense of
   enkrateia, while sophrosune, has, here also, only the more specific
   sense of modesty and irreproachableness of behavior [1 Tim. ii, 9;
   perhaps only in verse 15 in a somewhat wider sense], but the adjective
   sophron is used in a more general sense [1 Tim. iii, 2; Tit. i, 8; ii,
   5]. Temperateness in the wider and full sense is the self-restraining
   of the subject within his normal moral limits, a subordinating of all
   self-seeking desires to unconditional obedience to the moral law, and
   hence, on the one hand, as relating to sensuousness, a controlling of
   the sensuous desires by the moral reason, and, on the other, as
   relating to the spiritual, a controlling of self-love by love to God
   and to our neighbor,--a maintaining of the rights of the rational
   spirit in its true essence. That temperateness is at once also justness
   is self-evident; it is but another phase of the same virtue. Even as
   relating to the sensuous desires it is also justness, in so far as
   these are restrained within their moral limits out of regard to the
   higher rights of the spirit. Modesty, patience, and obediateness are
   special phases of this virtue; so also are shame, pudicity and
   chastity, as a keeping of sexual sensuousness within bounds, a
   subordinating of it to its higher moral conditions; shame and pudicity
   are rather the inner elements, the state of the heart, and chastity
   rather the outward manifestation; they are an expression of the fact
   that this sensuous instinct has absolutely no right per se, but only in
   the service of wedlock-love.--Temperateness presupposes indeed a
   difference and a possible antagonism between selfish desires
   (especially the sensuous ones) and the morally-rational consciousness,
   though not an actually-existing antagonism and opposition. In its
   manifestation it is more a negating virtue than justness, and yet its
   essence is very affirmative.--This virtue becomes most difficult where
   the individual energy stands forth most strongly over against general,
   rational right, and hence in the period of youthful vigor when the
   consciousness of personal strength and of self-will delights to cope
   with objective barriers, and seeks to cast them off as trameling
   fetters,--when the strongly self-conscious individuality delights to
   enjoy this consciousness, whether in the enjoyment of sensuous
   pleasure, or in that of unbounded freedom, or in that of
   will-assertion. Fidelity, justness, and courage are, for vigorous
   youth, much more easily attained to and preserved than the virtue of
   temperateness; but as all the virtues are only different phases of
   virtue in general, and as they are all connected with each other in a
   vital unity, hence the violation of one of them is necessarily also a
   violation of the others; intemperateness is, in every respect, per se
   also an infidelity, an unjustness and a cowardliness, and it leads
   directly to a further development of these vices.

   (4) Courage, the moral readiness to combat against whatever opposes the
   moral end,--expressed by the Greeks by the more limited andreia, and in
   the Scriptures by the higher and more inward notion of parrhesia [Eph.
   iii, 12; 1 Tim. iii, 10, etc.],--is the being joyous and confident in
   the carrying out of the moral idea on the basis of hopeful faith [Matt.
   v, 12; Acts ii, 29; iv, 13, 29, 31; ix, 27, 28; xiii, 46; xiv, 3;
   xviii, 26; xix, 8; xxvi, 26; xxviii, 31; Rom. viii, 31 sqq.; 2 Cor.
   iii, 12; v, 6, 8; xii, 10; Eph. iii, 12; vi, 19, 20; Phil. i, 20; 1
   Thess. ii, 2; Heb. xii, 3; Psa. cxviii, 5 sqq.]. The moral life of the
   Christian is a constant struggle [Luke xiii, 24; 1 Tim. vi, 12] as well
   against the outward hinderances of the moral life as also against the
   inner opposing desires and against carnal sloth and fear. Though both
   these forms of hinderance do not hold good in a strict sense for the
   unfallen state, still we must doubtless admit that there were
   relatively corresponding relations of a normal kind. During the
   development of man toward his ultimate perfection there constantly
   exists an, as yet, extra moral reality, namely, nature within and
   without him, which is to be brought within the dominion of moral
   reason, and which is, as extra-moral, also per se a barrier that is to
   be overcome by moral effort; however, it is not an active antagonism,
   and the effort does not involve suffering. Self-love, in itself
   perfectly legitimate, needs also to be brought into perfect
   subordination to the love of God, and the mastering of it requires
   conflict and courage. This "parrhaesia" is not mere feeling, not mere
   in4vard peace, but it is essentially a combat-courting courage, a
   persistence in the moral struggle in virtue of joyous trust in God.
   Absolutely sure of victory, it fears nothing and undauntedly carries
   out what it undertakes.

  SECTION CXL.

   In so far as God himself is the object of love, and in so far as, in
   the creature, the divine phase, the image of God, is brought into
   prominence, the above four virtues appear under a special form
   expressive of the essence of piety, as piety-virtues, which, however,
   do not stand along-side of the other virtues, but are in fact the
   highest and God-directed phase of the same. Fidelity as relating to God
   appears as moral faith; justness as moral devotedness or pious
   obedience; temperateness as filially-pious humility, as
   child-mindedness; and courage as hope or confidence.

   The piety-virtues, only partially corresponding to the so-called
   theological virtues, are the essence proper, the ground, the kernel and
   the crown of the virtues in general,--are neither super-ordinate nor
   co-ordinate to the four cardinal virtues, but are their essential
   substance and spirit itself.

   1. Faith, designated in Scripture by the same expression with fidelity,
   is the loving response to God's fidelity to us, and, as an expression
   of our fidelity toward the faithful God, is a high moral
   requirement,--is a loving confiding of our own being and life to the
   faithful love and truthfulness of God, a holding-fast of love to God.
   Were faith a mere holding for true, then it would not be a moral
   requirement, and hence the possession of it not a virtue; as fidelity,
   however, it is a virtue (§ 113). Faith is reckoned to man for justness
   or righteousness [Rom. iv, 3; Gal. iii, 6], for the reason that, as
   fidelity, it is itself justness toward God, and the root and essence of
   all righteousness.

   2. Obedience toward God, moral decotedness, hupakoe, is the inclination
   and willingness that God's claim upon us should be perfectly realized
   in our moral conduct, and hence that we should do that which, as God's
   creditors, we owe to Him [Rom. viii, 12]; we meet God's claim upon us
   only by perfect, voluntary and joyous submission to his will [Exod.
   xix, 8; xxiv, 3, 7; Deut. iv; xi, 1; xii, 1, 32; xiii, 4, 18; Jer. vii,
   23; Luke i, 38; James iv, 7; 1 Pet. i, 2, 14, 22; comp. Gen. vi, 22;
   vii, 5; xii, 4; xxi, 13 sqq.; xxii, 1 sqq.]; the obedient are by that
   very fact the just [Hos. xiv, 9; Mal. iii, 18; Matt. xxv, 37; 1 John
   iii, 7]; obedience is the fruit of faith [Heb. xi, 8], the expression
   of the child-mindedness of believers toward the Father. The Son of man
   is the holy pattern of obedience [Rom. v, 19; Gal. iv, 4; Phil. ii, 8;
   Heb. v, 8; Isa. liii].

   3. Humility, tapeinophrosune, the moral and reverential confining of
   ourselves within the limits fixed by God for us as creatures and for
   each of us, in his special moral calling, is an absolute duty even of
   sinless man, inasmuch as the moral creature, as related to God, is and
   has nothing which is not to be recognized as depending upon God's
   support; hence it holds good also of the angels [Col. ii, 18], and of
   Christ as the Son of man in his subordination to God [Matt. xi, 29;
   comp. xx, 28; Phil. ii, 6-8; Heb. xii, 2; John xiii, 4 sqq.]. All moral
   humility is at bottom humility before God [James iv, 10; comp. Gen.
   xxxii, 10; Luke xviii, 14], even as the first sin consisted in a lack
   of humility; when humility before men does not rest on this ground, it
   sinks to abjectness and servile-mindedness; it is only in humility
   before God that man learns to harmonize humility before men with a
   proper respect for his own moral dignity. All humility rests on faith
   and is also obedience; its essence, however, is a keeping within
   bounds, a self-retention within our divinely-appointed position [Matt.
   v, 3; xxiii, 11; Luke xxii, 24 sqq.; Acts xx, 19; Rom. xii, 3, 16; Eph.
   iv, 1, 2; Phil. ii, 3; Col. iii, 12; 1 Pet. v, 5; James iv, 6].
   Child-like humility aims not at high things, but only at the highest,
   which in fact are accessible only to child-mindedness,--retains always
   toward God its filial character [Matt. xviii, 3, 4]. Humility is a
   purely Christian virtue; to Greek ethics it was almost unknown (§ 21).

   4. Hope, elpis, mentioned in connection with faith and love as a high
   virtue [1 Cor. xiii, 13], directs itself with firm confidence toward
   the highest good as the goal to be attained to, toward the idea of the
   good [Rom. viii, 24], and is not a mere expecting of a future
   happiness, but a joyful trusting faith-born confidence that God means
   it well with us, and will also actually enable us to reach our moral
   goal, provided we honestly strive toward it,--is, in a word, that moral
   courage in God that is sure of its victory, and that has consequently
   already overcome all inward obstacles to the outward victory; it is not
   merely an involuntary state of feeling, but a morally-acquired good.
   All hope is faith [Heb. xi, 1], but it is also moral self-surrender and
   child-like humility, for it expects the victory not from itself but
   from God. The hope that is fixed merely upon created things is vain and
   sinful; but moral hoping in God does not end in disappointment [Rom. v,
   5], and all moral courage is based upon it [Psa. ix, 10; xxv, 2; xxxi,
   15; xl, 4; lvi, 4 sqq.; lxii, 6; xci, 2; cxii, 7; John xvi, 33; Rom.
   iv, 18; v, 2, 4, 5; xii, 12; Phil. iii, 1; iv, 4; 1 Cor. i, 10; iii,
   12, etc.]. God is a God of hope [Rom. xv, 13], because all hope is
   based on him, and relates to his promises. The word of the faithful God
   is the ground, the contents and the vitality of all true hope. Hope is
   a virtue belonging essentially only to the kingdom of God; among
   heathens only the Persians have as much as a darkly-groping hope; the
   Greeks looked but dismally into the future, and their ethics knows
   nothing of hope as a virtue; in the Old Testament, however, we meet
   with it almost on every page; it is the key-note of the
   religiously-moral life, constantly bursting out in inspired strains;
   the Christian's hope, as fulfilled in Christ, awakens and gives ground
   for new hope.

   As all virtue whatever is a force and a motive to moral action, much
   more is this true of the piety-virtues. All moral action directs itself
   essentially toward a yet to be attained good, and which consequently
   exists primarily only in thought; hence the moral motive is not merely
   love to an existing entity, but at the same time also love to a, as
   yet, not existing one, to a merely conceived one, the realization of
   which, however, is, in virtue of our love to the truly existing
   primative ground of all morality, absolutely sure to us,--hence it is,
   essentially, faith in the living and truthful God, and hope of the
   realization of the highest good. In virtue of this pious believing and
   hoping, as springing from our love to God, fidelity in our temporal
   calling becomes joyous perseverance; and in our working for the
   spiritual and the eternal, it becomes enthusiasm.

   Observation. The systematic development of the cardinal virtues has
   ever been one of the most weighty and difficult points in ethics. Plato
   was the first to present the four virtues, which were adopted by Sts.
   Ambrose and Augustine, and which then held sway through the entire
   Middle Ages and up to the most recent times; and to these were added
   and superordinated, without any clear connection, the three theological
   virtues (§ 31). The Greek classification of the virtues is, however,
   entirely unadapted to the Christian notion of virtue, as the violent
   construction of them, to which even Augustine had to resort, abundantly
   manifests; while with the Greeks the fundamental virtue was wisdom, in
   Christianity it is love, love to the loving, personal God; this love to
   God was entirely lacking to the Greeks, because with them its certain
   object was also lacking. Protestant ethics sought out, therefore, with
   a correcter consciousness, new paths, and that too from the very
   beginning (§ 37). The three cardinal virtues of Calvin: sobrietas,
   justitia, pietas, do not, however, exhaust the material, and they admit
   of no proper organic union, because pietas is not co-ordinate to the
   other two, but superordinate. Schleiermacher's cardinal virtues (§ 48):
   wisdom, love, discretion and perseverance, are, in spite of all the
   dialectical skill bestowed in their development, of a merely artificial
   character, and are least of all adapted to Christian ethics,--to which
   in fact he does not apply them; the Platonic virtues admit of a much
   more natural development. In the system of Schleiermacher, love is by
   no means presented in its full Christian significancy, least of all as
   love to God (which is in fact regarded as an unapt expression), but it
   is presented only as the "vivifying virtue, as working forth out of
   itself into the world, namely, into nature,"--as manifesting reason in
   its action upon nature; reason is the loving element, nature the loved;
   love to God is true only as love to nature (Syst. §§ 296, 303 sqq.);
   this is almost the very opposite of the Christian notion of love. C. F.
   Schmid accepts this classification under a more Christian form,
   without, however, developing it in greater fullness (Christl. Sittenl.,
   p. 528).--Most peculiar of all is Rothe's classification (Eth. 1 ed., §
   645 sqq.). He gives two virtues of the self-consciousness or
   rationality, and two virtues of self-activity or freedom. (1.)
   Individually-determined rationality is geniality,--aptness for an
   absolutely individual cognizing, so that the same can absolutely be
   accomplished by no other person-the artistic virtue proper; to it
   belong courage, composedness, modesty, grace, sympathy, confidence,
   etc. (2.) Universally-determined rationality is wisdom--aptness for a
   universal cognizing, so that the same may absolutely be accomplished by
   every other spirit in the same manner; it appears under the forms of
   considerateness, impartialness, sobriety, instructiveness, benevolence,
   fairness, etc. (3.) Individually determined freedom is originality, the
   virtue which specifically qualifies for individual forming,--the social
   virtue proper; to it belong valor, temperateness, chastity, dignity,
   unselfishness, fidelity, etc. (4.) Universally determined freedom is
   the strength which leads to a universal forming, that is, to laboring
   and acquiring,--the public or civic virtue proper; it appears under the
   forms of persistence, patience, self-control, eloquence, beneficence,
   magnanimity, etc.

II. MORAL COMMUNION AS A FRUIT OF THE MORAL LIFE.

  SECTION CXLI.

   All moral activity is of a communion-forming character, and all true
   communion is an expression of love,--in nature an expression of
   immanent divine love, in humanity, an expression of human love. The
   highest end of the moral life is indeed the full morally-acquired
   communion with God, but man, as an individual being placed in natural
   and spiritual relations to other creatures, fulfills his moral destiny
   not in an exclusive communion with God, but only in a communing at the
   same time with the children of God, and hence he has it as a moral duty
   to form this his relation to other men into a moral communion, without
   which his personal perfection cannot be reached. The most primitive
   natural communion is sexual communion, from which naturally arises the
   second form. that between parents and children; both forms are to be
   raised from the merely natural. to the moral communion of the family.

   As all love presupposes some form of communion, though it be ante-moral
   and merely natural, hence the moral forming of this communion is not an
   absolutely new creating of a communion, but the spiritual exalting of
   one that already exists naturally. Though moral communion with God is
   the highest good, still this does not exclude, but includes, a
   communing with other rational creatures, for God is himself in
   communion with them. Mystical quietism is but a refined self-seeking,
   and conflicts with the essence of Christianity; for God did not create
   mere isolated beings, but destined them for each other; "it is not
   good," not in harmony with the moral destination of the race, "that man
   should be alone," for an isolated person lacks a very essential sphere
   of moral activity-that upon which he can not only (as in his relation
   to God) appropriate and obey, and not only (as in his relation to
   nature) dominate, but also, as relating to beings like himself, form
   and appropriate at the same time in mutual moral reciprocity. Without
   moral communion with other men morality cannot come to its full
   development; communion is not a mere inactive condition, but it is a
   productive good, a condition of new, higher morality. This of itself is
   a condemnation of the hermit-life; of such a life the Scriptures know
   nothing; solitude may indeed be salutary as a preliminary preparation
   for a calling that requires great collection of soul [Luke i, 80], as
   indeed the Son of man himself resorted thereto for a while [Matt. iv];
   but the Sabbath-introspection of the soul cannot, as opposed to an
   active life among men, be made the exclusively-legitimate life. The
   recluse life, even where the severest discipline is exercised against
   the sinful nature, is an immoral renouncing of the moral duties of man
   toward his fellows, a dissolving of the kingdom of God into mere atoms,
   into mere isolated individuals, and hence it was utterly foreign to the
   earliest Church.

   The communion of man with his fellows is primarily of a merely natural
   character; but man is to have in his whole being and nature, and above
   all in his spiritual nature, nothing which he has merely naturally
   received and not also morally appropriated to, and formed for, himself.
   The communion of the sexes, as well as that between parents and
   children, is primarily as yet extra-moral,--does not yet distinguish
   man from the brute; both forms of communion need to be raised to a
   moral character, otherwise they will sink to an immoral one; even
   parental love may be sinful.

   (a) THE FAMILY.

  SECTION CXLII.

   Natural sexual love is, as a manifestation of the divine love ruling in
   nature, per se a type of moral communion, but it does not itself
   suffice to create this. The merely natural, and hence extra moral,
   element of the same is confined entirely to the unconscious natural
   inclination; the exalting of the mere inclination to real love is never
   an ante-moral or extra-moral process, but springs of moral
   determination; the actual accomplishing of the sexual communion should
   never follow upon mere natural love, but must, as a free act, be simply
   a manifestation of the already realized moral communion of the persons
   in virtue of moral love. Without this condition it is not extra-moral,
   but anti-moral, as an actual destruction of moral communion.

   Sexual communion is the first possible communion, and hence has in
   nature its first incitation. As man was not an absolutely other and new
   creation but the divinely-animated nature-creature, so also is the
   first moral communion not one that was absolutely new-created by man,
   but a morally-exalted natural communion. Sexual love prevails
   throughout animated nature,--is its highest life-function, and,
   therefore, also the highest manifestation of the divine love as ruling
   in nature The flower develops in its sexual bloom its highest force and
   splendor; the brute has, in sexual love, the highest pleasure-feeling,
   that of a perfect, mutually life-unifying harmony with its like; it is
   the feeling that it is not a mere isolated unit, but a living member of
   a higher whole. It is not man's duty to suppress this
   life-manifestation, but to exalt it,--to raise the
   unconsciously-prevailing love of the animal into a conscious and moral
   love. Though in idea the same, the sexes are in reality different,
   mutually complementing each other to the full idea of man. The somewhat
   clumsy myth as to the original androgynous forms of humanity, as given
   in Plato's Symposium, is but a distorted echo of the thought, much more
   suggestively expressed in the Biblical account, of the formation of Eve
   from a rib of Adam.

   Love, according to its inner idea, is not only preservative but also
   communicative, awakening new life and promoting it; hence the
   propagation of the human race is conditioned on the highest earthly
   love. All love is an appropriating and a forming at the same time. In
   sexual love the sexes mutually appropriate and form each other as
   natural beings, though in different degrees; the spiritually moral
   appropriating and forming must, however, precede the natural, as its
   moral consecration and conditionment; the reversing of this relation,
   the letting the moral and personal love simply follow the sexual
   communion, is morally impossible, as thereby the latter is degraded to
   a purely bestial, immoral character, and cannot become the
   starting-point of a moral communion.

   A possession is moral only as property, that is, in virtue of its
   having been morally-acquired and appropriated; now the communion of the
   sexes is the complete giving up and appropriating of each party as the
   property of the other; hence when it is not a manifestation and fruit
   of an already-accomplished, morally-personal, spiritual unity,--of the
   appropriation of the persons as moral and hence as permanent
   inalienable property,--it is then not only not a simply natural action
   but an immoral throwing away of one's moral personality, an
   irremediable ruining of the moral personality of the other. Lost
   innocence is irrecoverable; mere sexual communion without moral love is
   a defamation. But moral love is in its very essence permanent; that
   which is by love appropriated to the person as property is
   inalienable,--can be destroyed only with the personality itself.
   Whoredom is not mere bestiality, but, as a moral self-abandonment, it
   is below bestiality; for the brute does not throw itself away. Even in
   the case of the first man, moral love preceded sexual communion. "And
   Adam said: this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she
   shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man" [Gen. ii, 23
   sqq.]. This is a child-like, natural expression of moral love, the full
   consciousness of the harmony and unity between man and wife; the wife
   is the man's other ego, belongs to him, is destined to him as property,
   as also he to her; she is of, and for, him. Hence to this expression of
   moral love joins itself, as a sequence, the further thought: "therefore
   shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his
   wife, and they shall be one flesh;" the becoming one in the flesh
   follows only from and upon the being one in spirit; they become one
   also sexually, because they have mutually recognized each other as
   joined in a personally-spiritual unity. The moral consciousness of the
   personal belonging of the one to the other, the free recognition of
   their mutually-possessing each other as property, is the indispensable
   antecedent moral condition of sexual communion. Without this moral
   condition, that which is the acme of the nature-life, the innermost
   center of nature-mysteries, the synthesis of all that is wonderful in
   nature-force, namely, the generative act,--which, as moral, is a sacred
   act,--becomes an absolutely immoral one, and sinks man toward the brute
   more than any other natural action.

  SECTION CXLIII.

   Moral sexual love being a love of the persons to each other, and the
   moral personality of the one being per se equal to that of the other in
   moral worth, and consequently also in moral rights, hence that giving
   up of the one person, as a complete moral possession, to the other,
   which is required by sexual communion, is only then possible when this
   surrender is a mutual one, that is, when the two persons belong to each
   other exclusively; and hence moral sexual love exists only in the
   marriage of two persons, in view of sexual communion and consequently
   of complete personal life-communion. Polygamy is morally
   impossible,--is but legally regulated whoredom, makes a real personal
   love-surrender, and hence marriage itself, impossible. For the same
   reason, marriage is morally indissoluble. Marriage is not a mere right,
   is not simply allowed, but it is a divinely-willed and expressly
   ordained moral communion, and hence the entering upon it is not a
   merely natural but also a religious action, which, standing as it does
   under the express, promise of the divine blessing, is very naturally
   invested with a religious consecration.

   The extra-Christian notion of polygamy absolutely excludes the moral
   essence of marriage; in it the woman is indeed the man's property, but
   not man the woman's; this involves a difference in the moral worth and
   rights of the sexes, which, from a moral stand-point, is impossible;
   for it denies the moral personality of the woman; and in fact, in
   polygamy, woman is only a slave. Of the polygamy of the Old Testament
   it is not here the place to speak. The primitive divine institution of
   marriage recognizes only the marriage with one woman, and the New
   Testament presupposes this throughout [Matt. xix, 3 sqq.; 1 Cor. vii,
   2; xi, 11; Eph, v, 28; 1 Tim. iii, 2].

   As marriage rests entirely on personal love to a person, hence it is
   not a mere legal relation; and as in it the persons belong entirely to
   each other,--are to each other a mutual property, the essence and
   strength of which is love,--hence to view marriage as a merely legal
   relation not only falls below the moral idea of marriage, but is per se
   immoral, for a contract-relation presupposes the non-presence of
   mutually-confiding love,--excludes a perfect moral
   life-and-body-communion, the reciprocal belonging to each other as a
   moral property; on the contrary, such a contract tends to raise between
   the two persons, as exclusively bent on their personal advantage, the
   separation-wall of distrust, and delivers the one consort to the other
   for mere stipulated service and use. As little as a contract-relation
   is conceivable between parents and children in their mutual family
   duties, just so little is it morally possible between husband and wife.
   Sexual communion when based on a mere legal contract is only
   respectable concubinage; it stands essentially on an equal footing with
   polygamy.--The generating of children is not so much the purpose as
   rather the blessing of marriage; its purpose is absolutely the
   fulfilling of moral love; marriage is and continues in full validity
   even where this blessing is wanting. The legal principle that "the
   chief end of marriage is the generating and training of children," is
   consistent rather with a legalized concubinage or with polygamy than
   with the moral idea of marriage, and would in consistency require that
   barrenness be regarded as a perfectly valid ground for divorce.

   For the simple reason that consorts belong to each other as moral
   property, marriage admits morally of no dissolution. A moral property
   is inseparably united with the moral peculiarity, and hence with the
   personal essence of the individual,--is, like this essence,
   inalienable. It is as impossible morally to dissolve a marriage as it
   is for a person to separate from his personal life, his peculiar
   character, and hence from his own self; and, as a violent internal
   anarchy of the spirit, namely, in insanity, is conceivable only in a
   sinfully-disordered state, so also is a dissolution of marriage
   conceivable only in a state of sinfully morbid disorder,--it is in fact
   an ethical insanity, a moral ruin of the two self-separating consorts.
   Christ affirms this moral impossibility of divorce [Matt. xix, 3-9],
   and bases his doctrine on this significant reason: "They are no more
   twain, but one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not
   man put asunder." This is not two reasons but only one; God has joined
   together marriage in his primative instituting of it, that is, by his
   creative will, which established the essence of marriage to consist in
   the fact that the two consorts should be one flesh, one single
   absolutely inseparable life as to soul and body, even as every living
   body is a single inseparable whole, and any dissevering of it, the
   death of the same. The indissolubility of marriage is still more
   strongly emphasized by Christ by his citing the words of the Creator at
   its institution: "I For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
   and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh." Man
   is not to abandon his father and mother with his love, though he may
   outwardly withdraw from them in order to build up a family of his own;
   but still more intimate than the bond between parents and children, is
   the bond between husband and wife, who mutually fully belong to each
   other. Now if the bond of love and unity between parents and children
   can never be dissolved without great moral violence, still less can the
   bond between husband and wife be morally dissolved. The unity of the
   "flesh" is not to be understood merely, nor even chiefly, of the bodily
   union, but alludes to the highest and perfect moral union of the whole
   life of both body and soul. A merely spiritual unity is designated by
   mia kardia kai psuche [Acts iv, 32], but husband and wife are also heis
   mian sarka [1 Cor. vi, 16; comp. vii, 4; Eph. v, 28 sqq.]. Adultery
   alone works divorce, and all divorce is in its moral essence adultery
   [comp. 1 Cor. vii, 10], and, as relating to the children, a ruthless
   annihilating of the family.

   It is of high significancy that the Scriptures expressly affirm the
   divine institution of marriage, and give to moral marriage a promise of
   special blessing [Gen. i, 28; ii, 24; ix, 7; Matt. xix, 4; comp. Psa.
   cxxviii, 3; cxxvii, 3-5]. Hence marriage cannot in any sense be
   implicated in unsanctity or lowness, so as to be inconsistent with a
   truly spiritual and holy life; otherwise God, when he introduced woman
   to man as called to be holy, would have encouraged him to turn aside
   from his high destination, and Adam would have had not merely the right
   but in fact also the duty of declining this gift of divine love; the
   creation of the woman would really have been the first temptation. In a
   normal, uncorrupted state of humanity it is not only the right, but
   also the duty, of the morally and corporeally mature individual to live
   in this God-instituted state of marriage; it is not marriage itself but
   the particular choice of the consort that is left to the particular,
   personal preference of love. God's declaration: "It is not good that
   the man should be alone; I will make him an help-meet for him,"
   distinctly implies that celibacy per se is not the better but the less
   good state,--as well for man, for he ought to have a help-meet, as also
   for woman, for her express destination is to be a help-meet for the
   man. Of the relations of marriage after the fall into sin, it is not
   here the place to speak.

   The fact that in all not totally savage nations marriage is not
   constituted simply by the consent of the two persons, but by some sort
   of solemn and, most usually, religious ceremony, is a significant
   implication of the moral essence of marriage; and the importance that a
   people places on the religiously-moral consecration of marriage, is a
   pretty safe criterion of its morality in relation to the sexual life.

  SECTION CXLIV.

   The two consorts stand to each other, as moral persons, on an equal
   footing; they both find their union in a complete devoted love, and
   hence, in fact, in a loving, free subordination to the moral law. The
   consorts complement each other also in spiritually-moral respects; and
   it is only in respect to this harmony-conditioning complementing that
   the woman is in many things rather guided than self-determining. This,
   however, is not a real domination of the man over the woman as over a
   subject, but only a conditional super-ordination of the man as the
   actively-guiding unity-point of the common life. As a moral relation
   marriage rests on freedom, that is, on free mutual choice; consequently
   it presupposes the moral maturity of the two lovers. This freedom of
   choice, however, is not irrational caprice, but determines itself in
   view of the true life-harmonizing, reciprocally-complementing, personal
   peculiarity of the two parties, and receives its moral ratification by
   its being freely recognized on the part of the moral community, and
   primarily of the family.

   But moral equality is not sameness. As the final destination of all
   moral beings is the same, hence a difference of the moral worth of the
   sexes is not conceivable [Gal. iii, 28; 1 Pet. iii, 7]. The inferior
   position of the female sex in all non-Christian nations is a sign of
   moral unculture, which even the Greeks did not entirely put off. The
   account of the creation of woman indicates her true dignity; taken from
   man's heart, she belongs to man's heart, and is not a slave at his
   feet; she is a part of him,--is not merely flesh of his flesh but also
   soul of his soul. The antithesis of sex. which is not of a merely
   bodily character, conditions indeed also very different moral duties;
   but these duties are absolutely equal in moral worth. The precedency of
   the woman in the interior of the family is in no respect less than that
   of the man in the civic sphere; and though, in virtue of this
   difference, the woman is, in many respects,--especially in those of the
   external, public life, that is, of the outward-directed
   activity,--properly subject to the man as the natural leader in this
   sphere [Eph. v, 22, 23], yet, as an offset to this, the man is in his
   turn properly dependent on the woman in the sphere of female activity;
   it is not to the credit of the man to dominate in the kitchen and
   nursery. Each rules, by the constitution of nature, in his own sphere;
   and it is perfectly in order for the woman, in her sphere, to exercise
   a determining influence on the man (§ 69). The historical
   tyrant-relation of the man over the woman is not the original and true
   one, and is inconsistent with true confiding love and with the dignity
   of womanhood, and is expressly explained in the Scriptures as a
   punishment for sin [Gen. iii, 16]. On the other hand, however, a
   certain guiding super-ordination of the man is the original and normal
   relation, and is in no respect a fruit of the fall; Adam was as guilty
   as Eve: sin was effectual only in changing the original normal
   subordination of the woman into a relation of servitude. Though the
   woman is, in more than one respect, the "weaker vessel" [1 Pet. iii,
   7], nevertheless she is a "co-heir of grace;" and she has, though
   indeed another and peculiar, yet not a less noble moral life-task than
   the man; as the help-meet of man it is hers faithfully to preserve and
   foster that which the stronger and more independent-willed man actively
   creates. The strong vital initiative, the fixing of the goal, and the
   task of producing, are the work of the man; in this work the woman is
   to be for him, to aid him, to have him for the vital central-point of
   the activity peculiar to her [1 Cor. xi, 8, 9]. Though the woman had
   first sinned, and the man was thus led astray by her, yet the offended
   and sentencing God turns himself first to Adam, and requires account of
   him, and then afterward to Eve; Adam was in duty required to strengthen
   and dissuade the yielding and sinning woman, and not to let himself be
   led by her.

   The contracting of marriage is neither a mere business-transaction nor
   a fruit of a simple falling in love; where moral love does not form the
   marriage, there it is desecrated. Hence marriages cannot be planned and
   brought about simply by parents, no more than can the parents practice
   virtue for their children; the moral must be accomplished by each for
   himself. The free personal choice that is absolutely necessary to
   marriage proper is not to be made arbitrarily or by hap-hazard; it aims
   essentially at the realization of the complete life-unity of the two
   persons, to the end of moral communion. This unity, and hence this
   perfect harmony, presupposes a difference and at the same time a
   similarity of the spiritually and bodily self-complementing persons.
   The difference consists in the normal spiritual and corporeal
   antithesis of the sexes in general, and, in particular, in the
   respective peculiarity of the persons, which finds, largely, in the
   opposite peculiarity its complement, and hence its moral satisfaction;
   a fiery, impassioned temperament is advantageously complemented by one
   that is gentle and calm. The similarity consists in the essential
   agreement of the persons, not merely in their moral and spiritual, but
   also in their physical peculiarities,--a similarity which can well
   exist in the midst of large difference. Without the similarity there
   would be no unanimity; without the difference there would be no mutual
   complementing, and hence no mutual attraction. The selecting for
   marriage is a finding of the complementing personality, and is free and
   unfree at the same time. There lies, indeed, in this finding, something
   of the mysterious, something which transcends the dialectical
   consciousness; and an anticipatory feeling antecedes, even in a normal
   state of things, the definite recognizing of the person; the matter
   should not rest, however, at the stage of mere feeling, but the person
   should at once exalt it to a rational consciousness,--should
   transfigure the ante-moral love-feeling into rational love.

   The morally-rational character of the contracting of marriage is
   recognized by usages prevalent among all not utterly uncultured
   nations, and is guaranteed by the fact that it is not left to the mere
   discretion of the individuals, but is subject to the ratifying
   recognition of the moral community, and hence primarily of the parents
   concerned [comp. 1 Cor. vii, 37]. Though parents are not entitled so
   far to represent their children as to choose consorts for them, yet
   they are perfectly entitled to ratify the choice of their children by
   their approval.

  SECTION CXLV.

   Marriage as productive is the basis of the more extended family, which,
   like marriage, is not a merely natural but essentially a moral
   relation. The family members stand to each other either in the relation
   of equality, as husband and wife or as brothers and sisters, or in that
   of super-ordination and subordination, as parents and children. The
   relation between parents and children is the first inequality among
   men, and the presupposition and type of all other relations of
   super-ordination and subordination. Parents and children stand to each
   other in the relation of moral personalities, and hence also of mutual
   moral duties; parents have, in relation to their children,
   preponderatingly the duty of forming, and hence of educating, during
   the progress of which, however, the constantly and necessarily
   therewith-connected duty of sparing, rises gradually to greater
   prominence as the development advances, until finally it predominates,
   and the child has attained to its moral majority. As, however, in a
   process of normal development, the parents also constantly advance
   spiritually and morally, hence they always retain their super-ordinate
   relation to the children even as matured; their formative influence on
   the children can never cease, and never gives place to a relation of
   moral equality with them. The children, on their part, continue always,
   though not in a constantly like manner, subject to the parents in
   reverential obedience, which, however, as itself resting upon love to
   God, is ever also conditioned thereby.

   The difference between consorts and blood-relatives rests on the
   difference between moral and natural communion. In both cases the
   communion is not only spiritually-moral but also corporeally-natural.
   With consorts, however, the bodily-natural communion rests on an
   antecedent moral communion; and with blood-relatives the moral
   communion rests on the precedent corporeally-natural communion; the
   former become corporeally one because they love each other, the latter
   love each other because in blood they are already one; the former
   proceed from an original state of separation, toward union; the latter
   tend from their original union to a state of separation;
   blood-relationship proper precludes sexual communion. The fact that
   relatives are bound to each other by especially close bonds of love
   [Gen. xiii, 8, 9; xiv, 14 sqq.; xviii, 23 sqq.; xxix, 13 sqq.; Exod.
   xviii, 5 sqq.; Ruth i; ii, 20; Luke i, 38, 40, 58; comp. Job xix, 13;
   Psa. xxxi, 12; lxix, 8], does not conflict with the more general love
   of neighbor.

   In the family begins, now, moral society with all its normal
   differences. Husband and wife do not as yet constitute a society, for
   they are one flesh; nor do parents and children form one, for although
   they are one spirit, yet they stand to each other in the relation of
   super-ordination and subordination. Persons who are entirely alike, and
   who stand to each other in absolutely like relations, constitute indeed
   a multitude, but not a society; where there is no vital all-guiding
   nucleus, no throbbing heart for the body, no soul for the acting
   members, there is no living whole, no society. Inequality, unlikeness,
   lies in the essence of every moral society,--not an inequality of the
   moral rights of personalities, but an inequality, a difference, of
   spiritually-moral position in and relation to society. Parents are the
   first princes, and true princes are the fathers of their people; patres
   was the title of distinction of the Roman senators; "elders" is used in
   a like sense for the leaders of moral society in almost all the free
   constitutions of antiquity and also of the church. Parents are the
   guides of their children by the grace of God, for children are a gift
   of divine grace [Gen. xxi, 1; xxv, 21; xxix, 31; xxx, 6, 17 sqq.;
   xxxiii, 5; Exod. xxiii, 26; Deut. vii, 14; Ruth iv, 13; 1 Sam. ii, 21;
   Psa. cxxvii, 3; cxxviii, 3; comp. 1 Tim. ii, 15]; therein lies the
   right as well as the duty of the parents. Guiding the children in God's
   name, standing in God's stead for them [Eph. vi, 1; comp. Lev. xix,
   32], they have not only a right to reverential obedience, but also the
   duty of reverence-awakening training. Parental love is per se strictly
   natural, hence it is found even in the natural man [Gen. xxi, 16; xxxi,
   28, 43, 50, 55; 1 Kings iii, 16 sqq.; Isa. xlix, 15; Matt. ii, 18; Luke
   xv, 21 sqq.; John iv, 47 sqq.], and consequently very much more so in
   the pious [Gen. ix, 26, 27; xxi, 11, 12; xxii, 2; xxiv; xxviii, 1-4;
   xxxvii, 3, 34, 35; xlii, 36 sqq.; xliii, 14; xliv, 22, 30; xlv, 28;
   xlvi, 30; xlviii, 10 sqq.; Exod. ii, 2 sqq.; 2 Sam. xii, 16 sqq.; xiii,
   30 sqq.; xiv; xviii, 33; xix, 1 sqq.; Prov. x, 1; xv, 20; Jer. xxxi,
   15; Matt. ii, 14; Luke ii, 35, 44; John xix, 25].

   It is the part of parents to cultivate their children into
   morally-matured personalities; this is not merely a right of the
   parents, but also of the children, and hence, for the former, a duty;
   they are to impart to their children the spiritually-moral attainments
   of their own spiritual development, and consequently also those of
   humanity in general, so that the children shall not have to go through
   again, in the very same manner, the same absolutely new-beginning
   development as the parents, for this is simply the manner and
   characteristic of nature-objects, but that they may place themselves in
   the current of history, and learn and appropriate to themselves its
   spiritual results, and then, in their turn, carry them further forward.
   All spiritual forming of the, as yet, spiritually immature is an
   historical working,--an initiating of the, as yet, immature spirit into
   the current and working of history. Now, as the child is in fact to
   ripen on into a morally-mature personality, and yet from the start
   already is, both in essence and in faculties, a moral personality,
   hence the forming of the same by the parents is never a strictly
   exclusive influencing, and hence, on the part of the child, never a
   merely inactive receiving, but always also a spiritually-moral
   co-operating of the child, a constantly increasing initiative
   self-forming of the same, so that consequently from the very start
   there must always be united with the formative activity upon the child,
   also a sparing bearing toward it; and such a forming is in fact
   education.--Education,--which, as aiming at the moral goal, namely,
   harmony with God and with the totality of moral being, must always be
   at the same time a natural and a spiritual, a special and a general
   forming, directed toward bringing the child to God and to God-sonship
   [Gen. xviii, 19; Deut. vi, 7; xi, 19; xxxi, 12, 13; xxxii, 46; Psa.
   lxxviii, 3 sqq.; xxxiv, 12; Isa. xxxviii, 19; Eph. vi, 4; comp. Luke
   ii, 27],--is a characteristic manifestation of rationality; the brute
   needs no education, as it is never destined to become free and moral.
   All created beings are, in their essence, naturally good; but it is
   only by education that they become morally good, and truly rational and
   free. Wherever the morally uncultured and unmatured undertake to
   establish liberty, there it soon results in unbridled license, and, as
   an attendant thereof, in the coarse tyranny of the stronger. In the
   want and requirement of education are implied a recognition and
   admission that the entire true essence of the child is not conferred
   upon it immediately by nature, but must he first acquired by free
   spiritual acts, and that too not by merely individual acts, but by the
   spiritual appropriation of the already extant spiritual attainments of
   humanity,--by spiritual obedience toward the spiritually and morally
   mature. The child cannot educate itself, nor can it on the other hand
   simply be educated without its own moral co-operation; but it must
   willingly let itself be educated.

   Reverence for parents, and, what is only another phase of the same
   thing, for the aged in general, is regarded by all nations, with the
   exception of the totally savage, as a sacred duty [comp. Gen. ix, 23];
   and it is a sure sign of a deep moral corruption of the spirit of a
   people where there is a declension in the reverence of children for
   parents, and, in general, of youth before old age; and more especially
   so when this declension is not undeserved. In a morally-normal
   development-course of humanity it is absolutely inconceivable that old
   age should so deeply decline as to fall behind the wisdom and moral
   maturity of the youth; the superior wisdom and knowledge of divine and
   human things would, in virtue of the higher inner and outward
   experience, continue to be the imperishable possession of old age; and
   it belongs among the most distressing evidences of the sinful disorder
   of the human race, that in fact old age does frequently sink back to
   childishness, and needs to be taken under the guardianship of the
   children. If any one can regard this as the natural order of life, let
   him also regard as foolish and groundless the pain which every, not
   totally perverse, child's heart experiences at the sight of such a
   sinking of the gray head, before which it would fain only bow in
   reverence.

   Children have, toward their parents, predominantly the duty of
   appropriating, which, however, gradually passes over more and more into
   a self-forming, though without ever entirely breaking off from the
   formative influence of the parents; and the sparing bearing of the
   children toward the parents can never, save under utterly corrupted
   conditions, be transcended by their formative bearing toward them. The
   formative influence of the children upon the parents, that exists
   indeed from the very beginning, can, even after they have become
   morally mature, assume only a secondary rank. This
   predominatingly-receptive relation of the children to the parents is
   that of filial reverence [Gen. xlv, 9 sqq.; Exod. xx, 12; Lev. xix, 3;
   Prov. xxx, 17; Matt. xv, 4; Eph. vi, 2], the outward expression of
   which is obedience [Prov. xxiii, 25; Eph. vi, 1; Col. iii, 20]. Christ
   himself is the pattern also in this [Luke ii, 51; John xix,
   26].--Children, when entering into wedlock and establishing a new
   family, enter thereby indeed into a greater independence of the parents
   [Gen. ii, 24], but the bond between parents and children, the duty of
   the former to care for the weal and the honor of the latter [Gen. xxxi,
   48 sqq.; Deut. xxii, 13 sqq.], and that of the children to show
   reverence for the parents, is not thereby dissolved.

   The right of parents to obedience, and the duty of children to show it,
   are, however, essentially conditioned on the agreement or disagreement
   of the parental command with divine will, and can never become per se
   and unconditionally binding, For this right is not a merely natural but
   a moral one; the merely natural dependence of children on their parents
   extends, as with brutes, only so far as the state of actual
   helplessness and need extends; the moral dependence, however, is a
   permanent one that is never to be dissolved. The moral right of the
   parents to obedience rests on the fact that they do not represent their
   own individual will, but the divine will. And for this very reason the
   guilt of parents is so deep when they misuse their moral mission to
   educate in God's name, and lead the child away from God, placing their
   own sinful will in the stead of the divine will.

  SECTION CXLVI.

   Brothers and sisters sustain toward each other, in the same manner as
   consorts, though only in morally-spiritual respects. complementing
   relations; and their mutual love forms an essential element in the
   morality of the family-life; but this complementing is, because of the
   predominant like-character of the parties, never perfect and
   all-sufficient, and hence brothers and sisters naturally seek for
   complementing elements also outside of the family-circle. This form of
   love which passes beyond the merely natural communion and freely
   selects for itself the complementing personality, is friendship.

   Also the mutual love of brothers and sisters is primarily of a purely
   natural character and requires to be exalted to a moral one [Gen.
   xxxiii; xxxiv; xlii, 24 sq.; xliii, 16 sqq.; xliv, 18 sqq.; xlv, 1
   sqq.; 1, 17; Exod. ii, 4 sqq.; Psa. cxxxiii, 1; Luke xv, 32]. Brothers
   and sisters can never personally complement each other to such an
   extent as that the need of friendship outside of the family-circle
   should not arise; they are originally too homogeneous, too similar, to
   render attainable that full harmony that both requires, and perfectly
   consists with, large difference. Brother and sister complement each
   other much more than brother and brother or sister and sister; and they
   in fact usually unite themselves more intimately with each other than
   do brothers or sisters among themselves; nevertheless there remains
   also here, and especially as spiritual maturity draws near, an
   unbridged chasm, and there is felt the need of a harmony more
   vital--one that is conditioned on a more strongly developed antithesis.
   It is not a loveless turning away from the family, but a strictly
   legitimate impulse, when the boy and girl seek after outside
   friendship. This does not interfere with the family-love, but heightens
   it. Friendship is an enlarged brother-and-sister love, or rather it is
   its complementing of itself outside of the family proper; it is
   brotherly love as resting upon purely spiritual affinity. Hence
   friendship is usually stronger in the period of transition from the
   original narrow family-circle into new and more independent forms of
   life; and on the establishing of a new independent family-circle it is
   usual for the friendship of the consorts with others to grow less
   strong, and for new friendships to be less easily formed; wedlock-love
   occasions an enfeebling of friendship; he who in youth has Wad true
   friendships usually turns out to be an affectionate consort; and
   friendship with persons of the other sex very readily develops itself
   into real sexual love, and is consequently not without its essential
   dangers.

  SECTION CXLVII.

   The necessity of the complementing of family love by friendship,
   indicates of itself the reason of the moral impossibility of marriage
   between near blood relatives. The instinct that prompts brothers and
   sisters to seek friendship outside of the narrower family-circle,
   prompts them also to seek for themselves consorts outside of the same.
   The requisite antecedent condition of marriage, a difference of the
   bodily and of the spiritual peculiarities of the persons, exists most
   feebly in near blood relatives; and marriage is, in its very essence, a
   free moral communion which does not spring from a natural communion,
   but, on the contrary, itself gives rise to this. As marriage
   presupposes a moral equality, and is a relation of homogeneous
   reciprocal love, hence it would be, between parents and children, a
   revolting crime, inasmuch as here the relation of reverence is
   insuperable; also, as between brothers and sisters, it is, for all save
   the second generation of the race, absolutely inadmissible, partly for
   the reasons already given, and ill part because of that deep awe of the
   parental blood which holds good also as towards brothers and sisters.
   The antecedent moral presupposition of marriage is riot filial or
   brotherly love, but friendship.

   The obstacle to marriage as found in blood-relationship is one of the
   most difficult of ethical questions, not so much, however, because of
   any kind of doubt as to its legitimacy, as rather in reference to the
   moral grounds for this recognition, which in fact is almost universal
   and which prevails in almost all, even heathen, nations. With the
   adducing of mere outward grounds of fitness, such as the avoidance of
   near-lying temptation, very little is gained; also it is difficult to
   establish this prohibition, as a nature-law, from the practice of
   animated nature in general, for brutes do not observe it. The grounds
   lie deeper and are essentially of a spiritually-moral character. In the
   first place, however, a distinction is to be made between ascending and
   collateral blood relationship. Marriages between parents and children
   and within other ascending and descending degrees of relationship are
   an outrage even for our natural feelings in general [Lev. xviii; xx, 11
   sqq.; 1 Cor. v, 1 sqq.; comp. Gen. xix, 30 sqq.]. The insuperable
   relation of reverence between children and parents [comp. Gen. ix, 23]
   renders morally impossible any sexual mingling, inasmuch as sexual
   communion rests upon the closest confiding equality of the persons;
   whatever conflicts with filial and paternal love is absolutely immoral,
   and this would unquestionably be attendant upon sexual communion. The
   same is of course true of grand-parents and grand-children. The case
   stood originally somewhat different as far as regards marriage between
   brothers and sisters; in this respect there occur in the general
   consciousness some, though indeed very rare, exceptions. The Peruvians
   punished such marriages with death; and yet for political reasons they
   prescribed them for their ruling Inca. In the case of the children of
   Adam, God made an exception in the interest of the indispensably
   essential unity of the human race (§ 88). And the unconditional
   prohibition of such marriages could only come into force when the
   possibility of other alliances was fully realized. In the legislation
   of Moses, the sexual mingling of brothers and sisters was visited with
   anathemas and death [Lev. xviii, 9, 11; xx, 17; Deut. xxvii, 22]; and
   as early as in the time of Abraham such marriages were utterly foreign
   even to the heathen consciousness, as is evidenced by the fact that
   Abraham, in order to protect himself, caused Sarah to pass as his
   sister [Gen. xii, 13; xx, 2]. (That Sarah was really Abraham's
   half-sister in the stricter sense is not proved by Gen. xx, 12, as the
   expression "daughter of my father" may also designate Terah's
   grand-daughter, and it is not improbable that she was the daughter of
   Haran, Abraham's brother, and that her earlier name Iscah [Gen. xi, 29]
   was exchanged for the title of honor, Sarai [my mistress, my wife]; in
   verse 31 she is called Terah's daughter-in-law, which would hardly be
   said had she been his daughter; and whatever the facts may be, the
   contracting of this marriage falls before Abraham's call.)

   The most immediate ground for the inadmissibility of marriage between
   brothers and sisters lies in the fact, that though here the requisite
   likeness of disposition in the parties does exist, yet on the other
   hand there is lacking that degree of difference which is essential to a
   vital complementing harmony; brothers and sisters are entirely too
   homogeneous in their bodily and spiritual natures to give rise to a
   vital, fruitful, reciprocal influencing. Narcissus fell in love with
   his own image, and passed, for this very reason, for a simpleton; and
   brother and sister are to each other, each, the image of the other. No
   sensible man will select for himself as a friend one who is only his
   strictly-resembling second-self, but, on the contrary, such a one as,
   by his difference, will stimulatingly-complement himself; the same
   holds good of husband and wife; of these, because of their constant
   uniformity of life in marriage, it holds good in fact in a still higher
   degree. This explains also the well-known fact that an actual falling
   in love between brother and sister is among the rarest of occurrences,
   even under circumstances where moral corruption has taken deep root;
   (illustrated in the case of Amnon, 2 Sam. xiii, 1). To attempt to
   explain this natural phenomenon simply from the express law is
   inadmissible, and for this reason among others, because this law, as
   existing among all cultured heathen nations, can in fact be explained
   only from a natural conviction, and because this sentiment prevails
   even where in general no regard whatever is had to religious and moral
   laws. This reason, however, is not fully sufficient, because while
   indeed it has reference to, and accounts for, unhappy marriages, yet it
   does not explain why some marriages should be regarded as criminal;
   and, besides, in many cases, where only too great differences exist
   between brothers and sisters, it would not apply at all. A second
   reason for this inadmissibility reaches deeper, namely, that marriage
   as distinguished from a merely natural communion, must rest essentially
   upon a purely moral free choice and act; it exists in its truth only
   where it does not proceed from natural communion as developing itself
   into complete love, but where it first creates this natural communion;
   its purpose is to create love and spread it abroad, and not merely to
   affirm a love which is already strong from nature. Blood-relationship
   and marriage are two different moral ordinances and bonds, which are
   not to be intermingled with each other; marriage looks to the uniting
   of a previously existing antithesis by love, and not to the uniting or
   ratifying, a second time, of an already existing natural unity. It is
   because of this peculiarity that marriage forms the basis of all moral
   community-life, and must therefore express in itself the essential
   character of this life, namely, purely spiritual love. If the marriage
   of brothers and sisters were admissible, then the family would tend to
   hedge itself in upon its purely natural basis,--would grow up
   animal-like to a merely natural, but not to a purely spiritual,
   communion. There is need of the general dissemination of love, as St.
   Augustine remarks, and this would be obstructed by the possibility of
   marriage between brothers and sisters; and family self-seeking in
   narrow-hearted seclusion would become almost inevitable; marriage looks
   not merely to the uniting together of two persons, but also of two
   families. The moral development of a people as a whole imperatively
   requires this breaking down of the walls of family seclusiveness,
   namely, the non permission of the marriage of brothers and sisters;
   hence this prohibition is of high world-historical significancy.--The
   chief ground, however, and one which expresses itself chiefly in our
   natural feelings, is reverence for the parental blood which has passed
   from the parents over upon the children, and which calls for a
   respectful avoidance of fleshly-sensuous enjoyment. Man sees in his
   brother or sister not merely the image, but also the blood of his
   parents [comp. Lev. xviii, 9; vii, 8, 11 sqq., where this thought is
   implied]; and the feeling of reverential awe and shame that springs
   from this consciousness precludes any feeling of sexual love. And in
   general the feeling of reverence is uncongenial to sexual love; and
   when, as not unfrequently occurs, a maiden has stood in a reverential
   relation to the man who offers himself to her as husband, there the
   transition from this feeling of reverence to that of conjugal love
   costs her a severe and poignant struggle.--Where sin has actually taken
   deep root, there arise other grounds for the inadmissibility of the
   marriage of blood-relatives. But we must confine ourselves here to the
   expression of the fundamental idea.

  SECTION CXLVIII.

   The family is a unitary vital whole also in relation to its moral
   property; it is not a mere sum of simply isolated persons of like name,
   but a body and a soul--a moral person with a common moral honor and a
   possession of its own, in which all the single members participate.

   The family has as a living unity, also one spirit, a common moral
   life-purpose and a common moral peculiarity; the common life-purpose
   consists in the mutual promotion of the moral life in one God-inspired
   spirit; the common peculiarity is, spiritually, the moral honor of the
   family, and, outwardly, its temporal possessions. The moral
   acquirements of one family member, especially of the head, pass over to
   the whole family, and the deserts of the parents bear, in virtue of the
   divine order of the world, fruits of blessing for the children, and are
   rewarded upon them [Gen. xxvi. 4, 5, 24; xlix, 10, 26; Exod. xx, 6;
   Deut. v, 10; vii, 9; 2 Sam. ix, 7; xxi, 7; 1 Kings xi, 34; Psa. xxv,
   13; xxxvii, 25 sqq.; cxii, 2, 3; Prov. xiv, 26; xvii, 6; xx, 7; Jer.
   xxxii, 18; comp. 1 Cor. vii, 14; Rom. xi, 16]; and the sins of the
   fathers are visited upon the children, and are for them a shame and a
   misfortune [Gen. ix, 25; xx, 7, 17 sqq.; xlix, 7; Exod. xx, 5; xxxiv,
   7; Lev. xxvi. 39; Num. xiv, 18; Deut. v, 9; vii, 9; 1 Kings xi, 39; 2
   Kings v, 27; Job v, 4; xxi, 19; xxvii, 14; Psa. xxxvii, 28; cix, 9, 10;
   Prov. xi, 21; xvi, 5; Isa. xiv, 21; Jer. xviii, 21; xxxii, 18; Lam. v,
   7; Hos. iv, 6; comp. Matt. xxvii, 25], and the sins of the children
   upon the fathers, as their disgrace [Lev. xxi, 9; Prov. x, 1; xvii, 25;
   xxviii, 7; comp. Deut. xxii 13 sqq.],--whereof we shall speak elsewhere
   more fully. The consciousness, deeply rooted in all cultivated nations,
   of a transmission of deserts; of a moral nobility of family-lines, has
   a profoundly moral basis; but this moral solidarity of the family is
   conceived even by the Old Testament more clearly and more distinctly
   than was ever done in any heathen nation. This is morally a very
   weighty thought. Man is made to feel that he does not live and act as a
   merely isolated individual, but, on the contrary, every-where and
   always as a member of a moral whole,--that the fruits of his actions,
   be they good or evil, pass over to those who belong to him and with
   whom he is morally connected, and hence that in sinning he commits an
   injustice not merely against himself, but also against all whom he
   calls his own. So the family is a divine ordinance, so is the
   solidarity of moral deserts and guilts such also; this is not injustice
   but sacred justice, for the simple reason that man is never a merely
   isolated individual. That which is true of the spiritually-moral
   property of the family is true also of the material property, and upon
   this rests the principle of inheritance.

   (b) MORAL SOCIETY.

  SECTION CXLIX.

   Moral society is the family as enlarged by its own natural growth and
   by friendship, but which, in this enlarging, assumes also. an
   essentially different character. Social communion differs from
   family-communion by the greater retreating into the back-ground of the
   natural unity and at the same time of free personal choice; society
   itself assumes an objective, and, in some sense, nature-character; and
   the place of natural and free moral love is supplied by custom, which
   becomes more or less an objectively-valid power over the individuals.
   It differs, furthermore, from the family in this, that it involves a
   communion of a far more general character, one that absorbs into itself
   the individual person far less, and requires and brings about a more
   interrupted and only occasionally-exercised moral intercourse of its
   members. The members of society sustain to each other the relation of
   friendliness, which is larger in extent, but feebler in inner quality
   and power, than friendship. That form of love which manifests itself in
   friendliness, and which consequently constitutes the moral essence of
   society, is the love of neighbor, which, as distinguished from more
   intimate love, does not elect its own object, and is not directed
   toward particular persons but toward man in general. Social communion
   realizes itself through mutual, spiritual and natural, communicating,
   of which the latter form is the expression and the medium of the
   former. Spiritual communication may, however, take place only within
   the limits conditioned by the family, and hence only with some degree
   of moral reserve,--should never become family-confidentiality.

   The family throws itself open indeed, in a normal state of things, to
   and for, society, but it does not merge itself therein,--rather is it
   the uniform and indispensable moral basis and presupposition thereof;
   it is a morbid state of society that does not rest on the family, but
   rather throws it into the back-ground, and more or less assumes its
   place. Only the moral integrity and the deep-reaching moral nature of
   the family give to society moral vitality; without these elements
   society declines to selfish, enjoyment-seeking characterlessness.

   Society cannot, from its very nature, require as large a personal
   giving up of individual peculiarities as does the family; it rests
   essentially on a greater independence of its individual members to each
   other,--gives greater scope to the equal right of the individuals to
   independent peculiarities, than is the case with unreservedly-confiding
   love or reverence; it is made up therefore strictly only of the truly
   independent, and hence of the spiritually and morally mature; minors
   should belong predominantly only to the family, and should not as yet
   enter society; premature ripeness for society damagingly affects not
   only the taste for family-life but also the moral character of the
   person; and the most common reason for the characterlessness of the
   fashionable world, is the too early supplanting of the family-life by
   society-life. In society the individuals stand less in a strictly
   personal relation to each other,--stand not in the relation of a
   special, personal love, personally complementing each other, but rather
   as the single members of a more extensive generality. Here each one
   sees and loves, in the other, not so much the special personality as
   rather simply a single representative of society as a whole. In order
   to the exercise of social virtue, not so much depends on the personal
   choice of the individual--on the fact that I have to do with precisely
   this or that, to me, congenial personality--as on the fact that the
   person be simply a member of human, of moral, society in general. Hence
   the members of society make also less demands upon each other for
   mutual devotion and confidentiality than the members of a family; in
   the place of such perfect, mutual self-devotion as the property of
   others, come tender deference, politeness, friendliness and
   complacency. Politeness, which has nothing in common with
   hollow-hearted pretense, is not shown to the person as such but simply
   as a member of society, and should not be confounded with a
   manifestation of friendship, as this regards only the person. Forms of
   politeness are an expression of love, of friendliness, of humble
   deference, to another; they are manifestations of honor to whom honor
   is due, and it is due to every upright man [Rom xii, 10; xiii, 7; 1
   Pet. ii, 17; v, 5; and, for examples, see Gen. xviii, 2 sqq.; xxiii, 7,
   12; xxxii, 4, 18; xxxiii, 3, 6, 7, 13, 14; xliii, 26, 28; xliv, 18
   sqq.; Rom. xv, 14, 15; etc.].

   The boundary lines between the family and society are very delicate,
   but also very legitimate; and he who, from a misconception of this
   difference, oversteps these limits and demeans himself in society as in
   the family, that is, does not show that proper reserve which seeks not
   to press itself upon others,--in a word, he who shows himself
   over-confidential, is regarded, and rightly so, as indelicate,
   characterless, or impudent; and when the person so acting is a female,
   she is looked upon as unwomanly or shameless. French gallantry, for
   which, happily, we have no German word, is a treating of the female
   members of society as if they were family-members; it treats every
   maiden as if she were an affianced sweetheart; it manifests the
   appearance of love where neither its reality nor the design of
   realizing it exists; this is an immoral disintegration and invasion of
   the family by society, a breaking down of the limits between them. With
   the growth of gallantry the dissolution of the family usually increases
   also; and the gallant society-man usually is or turns out to be a very
   ungenial husband. That devotion, that full, mutual, spiritual
   self-communicating, and that confidentiality, which, within the family
   as well as within the bounds of friendship, are not only a right but
   also a duty become sinful when shown to society at large. Hence the
   personal love that manifests itself in the family is less in compass,
   but greater intensity in, than that love of neighbor which extends to
   all members of society without exception, as well as also without
   choice, and which manifests itself in the equally generally due spirit
   of friendliness [Matt. v, 47; Gal. v, 22; 1 Cor. xiii, 4; Eph. iv, 2,
   32; Col. iii, 12; 2 Tim. ii, 24; Prov. xii, 25; Ruth ii, 8 sqq.]. He
   who loves and treat the members of his family merely with the
   friendliness of neighbor-love sins quite as much as he who
   promiscuously treats any or every one he meets with as a personal
   friend or as a consort; and this holds good not simply and merely of
   society as sin-disordered, though of course the difference is here much
   greater than in a state of innocence. Christian neighbor-love is indeed
   designated as brother-love, and the members of the moral community are
   to regard each other as brethren, even as also Christ calls his
   disciples his brethren [John xx, 17; Heb. ii, 11] or his friends [John
   xv, 13, 14], but this must not be so taken as to do away with the
   difference between family-love and neighbor-love; but, on the contrary,
   it rather simply implies that the latter is a form of love that is to
   be shaped after the pattern of brotherly love proper. Society is to be
   progressively more closely allied to the family,--is to be more and
   more affectionately and intimately united together on the basis and
   after the pattern of the family; and the closer bonds of the family are
   not thereby relaxed but in fact confirmed. The Son of man who embraced
   entire humanity in his love, loved yet his disciples with a closer love
   than he felt for others; and even among the disciples there was one
   "whom the Lord loved" by pre-eminence--who lay upon Jesus' bosom; and
   also Lazarus was a special friend of the Lord [John xi, 3, 33 sqq.],
   although Christ's love to these persons was still always something
   essentially other than human friendship--the Friend never predominating
   over the divine Master.--Of the distinctions that naturally form
   themselves in every society, and hence of the classes of callings, we
   cannot as yet here treat, as their sharper separation springs of and
   presupposes a sinful perversion of humanity.

   As, on the part of the moral person, love in society is more of a
   general and, so to speak, impersonal character, so also is this love
   met from without by the objective reality of the moral, not so much as
   personal love in a personal form, as rather under a general and
   impersonal form--as a merely spiritual power, as custom. Custom is
   indeed upheld by the individual members of society, but it does not
   proceed from them as particular single persons, but rather from the
   collective public spirit of the whole. Custom is a fruit of the moral
   life, not of the individual, but of the collective public; it is the
   virtue of society as peculiarly-constituted; and, as such, it has a
   right to be respected by the individual; and the duty of the individual
   to conform to custom cannot be limited by mere caprice, but only by the
   higher moral law itself and by the legitimate peculiar duty of the
   individual subject. It is not requisite, in order to entitle social
   custom to the right of being respected, that in each particular case a
   definite moral or other rational ground be readily adducible for its
   continuance; this is in many cases even impossible; and though, of
   course, the custom, if legitimate, must ever have its sufficient
   reason, yet this reason is not always a universally-moral one. A
   respectful deference for that which has become historical in society is
   a high moral duty, provided simply that society itself is not already
   morally perverted. The ebullient juvenile vigor of the intensely
   self-conscious youth gladly recalcitrates against the historical
   reality of society,--is loth to recognize for itself any other limits
   than such as are imposed by the general and, as yet, not
   historically-determined moral law. The moral law, however, is not of a
   merely universal character, but shapes itself in society into a
   particular historical form; moral society has the same right to the
   forming and retaining of a peculiar character as has the individual
   person; and as the individual is entitled to be respected and spared in
   his moral peculiarity, so is entitled also, and with still greater
   right, the moral collective whole [Gen. xxix, 26]. It is a sign of
   moral crudity when individuals disregard social custom in cases where
   it is not positively evil, and oppose themselves to it for the simple
   reason that they do not regard it as absolutely necessary,--as, for
   example, in the style of clothing and in the forms of social
   intercourse. It is true, each individual is entitled to his own moral
   judgment as to a custom, and an immoral or irrational custom may by no
   means be spared or conformed to; on the contrary, there arises here the
   duty of reformatorily influencing society itself. But of such a
   perverted state of things we are not as yet here treating. The proper
   moral respecting of custom is good-mannered or becoming behavior
   koomios, 1 Tim. ii, 9; iii, 2]. The female mind embraces the moral more
   as an expression of custom; the male more as that of the law.

   As all communion of love is a mutual imparting, so is it also with
   social love; the basis and at the same time the moral limit of this
   imparting or communicating, is the family. The family throws itself
   open occasionally for society,--imparts itself to society, welcomes its
   members hospitably into itself. Hospitableness or hospitality [Gen.
   xviii; xix; xxiv, 31 sqq.; Exod. ii, 20; Lev. xix, 33, 34; Judges xix,
   20, 21; Job xxxi, 32; Matt. xxv, 35; x, 41, 42; Luke xi, 6; Acts
   xxviii, 7 sqq.; 1 Pet. iv, 9; Rom. xii, 13; 1 Tim. iii, 2; v, 10; Titus
   i, 8; Heb. xiii, 2] is properly a virtue practiced not by the
   individual, but predominantly by the family. It is the occasional
   letting in of society into the family, the outward manifesting of the
   love that prevails in the family toward those who stand to us simply in
   the relation of members in society. It is only the family that can
   exercise true hospitableness--that can constitute a hospitable house;
   this manifests itself, even in our present so radically perverted state
   of society, in the fact that it is always the housewife who takes the
   lead of the guest-circle, and gives it the family-consecration.
   Hospitality is one of the first and most natural manifestations of
   neighbor-love, hence it is highly esteemed even among many uncultured
   nations; it exists always in its highest form where also the family is
   preserved in high moral integrity, as, for example, among the ancient
   Germanic races. It is a very special and important characteristic of
   hospitality, that it is not exercised merely toward friends proper, who
   in fact already belong to the outer circle of the family, but also, and
   historically even primarily, to strangers who are as yet not known
   personally at all, that is, to man simply in his quality of neighbor.

  SECTION CL.

   The recognition of the moral character of a person on the part of moral
   society, is his social honor; each and every one has, normally, a moral
   right to such recognition by every other morally honorable person, and
   should strive to obtain and retain it. The actual manifestation of
   personal honor, as a moral possession, is personal dignity. No honor is
   morally valid save in so far as it is, at the same time, honor before
   God. The moral society into which the individual is incorporated by
   virtue, on the one hand, of custom, by which he as well as the
   collective society is influenced, and in which lie consequently
   recognizes the morality of society, and, on the other hand, by virtue
   of the honor which he enjoys in the eyes of society, and in which
   consequently his morality is recognized by the society, is for him his
   moral home.

   Only he has honor who has acquired a moral character; the characterless
   is honorless. Honor is the reflection of the personal character in the
   consciousness of society,--is its recognition by the same. Honor is the
   reverse phase of love; only the moral man can rightly love, and in
   loving he thirsts also to be loved, and hence to be recognized in his
   moral personality by others; the immoral man as such is not loved,
   because he is not in the possession of honor. Though honor is based on
   moral character yet it is not identical therewith,--it is character as
   having become objective in the moral consciousness of society. God's
   honor is not his holiness and his divine essence themselves, but the
   recognition of the same on the part of rational creatures; and as God
   vindicates and seeks his own honor [Exod. xiv, 4; 1 Sam. ii, 30; Psa.
   xlvi, 10; Isa. xlii, 8; xlviii, 11; Ezek. xxviii, 22; comp. John v, 23;
   Rom. xi, 36; xvi, 27], so also the moral man seeks, and rightly so, his
   honor, but only such as is at the same time honor before God, namely, a
   recognition of his conduct and spirit as those of a child of God, and
   hence an honor which is at the same time the witness of a good
   conscience before God [Psa. iii, 3; lxxiii, 24; cxii, 9; John v, 44;
   xii, 26, 43; Rom. ii, 6, 7, 10, 29; v, 2; 1 Cor. iv, 5; 2 Cor. x,
   18],--the pleasures of God in him who loves Him [2 Cor. v, 9; Col. i,
   10]. In this sense honor before men and the children of God is a high
   good [Psa. vii, 5; xlix, 11; lxxxiv, 12; Prov. iii, 16, 35; viii, 18;
   xi, 16; xxi, 21; xxii, 4; xxix, 23; Phil. ii, 29], and to disesteem
   such honor is either to think unworthily or to be too high-minded.

   Personal honor and social custom condition man's moral home. Society
   and country are only in so far a home as they are expressive of the
   spiritually-moral life of society. My fatherland is not where I am
   outwardly prosperous, but where I enjoy myself morally,--feel myself
   vitally at one with a moral community. Mere nature forms a sort of home
   only for the savage; a true home is of a spiritual character, and
   nature is such only as brought within the sphere of history, as
   transformed by man. It is at home that man enjoys his existence; the
   far-off is tempting mostly only for him who is as yet in process of
   development toward spiritual and character-maturity; the seeking of a
   new home is in normal circumstances less an affair of the single
   individual than of whole branches of a nation, namely, in cases of the
   founding of new colonies; but here in fact the moral home migrates
   along. To be shut out from one's home is properly regarded as a severe
   misfortune; the declaration that he should be a fugitive wanderer in
   the earth was the bitterest element in the curse upon Cain; among
   ancient nations banishment was the severest of punishments.

   (c) THE MORAL ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY.

  SECTION CLI.

   As single persons unite themselves into a family and develop in it a
   vitally organic life in common, so in turn society unites itself into a
   higher-organized copy of the family, into a society-family, into a
   homogeneous moral organism,--organizes itself into a real unitary life;
   social custom rises from being primarily a purely spiritual, impersonal
   power, and becomes a real personally-represented and actually self
   executing power,--that is, it becomes social right as expressed in law,
   in which form morality becomes for and over the individual an objective
   reality and power, and is not a mere formula but is in fact embodied in
   and tested and executed by moral personalities. There is no law without
   a personal representative and executor of the same.

   If at first view society appears as a mere falling apart of the family,
   as a loosening of the narrower bond of love and duties as existing in
   the family itself, as a dissolution of the family-generated collective
   spirit into mere independent individual spirits, as a freer-making of
   the single individuals,--and if it is nevertheless, at the same time, a
   necessary progress beyond the mere family-life,--still there can be no
   resting at mere society and social custom, but society must in turn in
   its further development return back to the fundamental character of the
   family,--must exalt itself to the ideal of the family and of its moral
   organism, even as the plant, when unfolded out of the seed into
   branches and leaves, in turn generates again in the fruit the original
   seed. This return of society to the family takes place not merely
   through the fact that society itself becomes the occasion to constantly
   new unitings of families, but essentially by the fact that it itself
   takes on the character of a family of a higher grade,--that custom
   itself (which rules in society only as a bodiless spirit) assumes full
   objective reality, attains to flesh and blood and vital force, so as to
   vindicate and execute itself against whatever individual will may
   oppose it. Social custom depends for its realization entirely on its
   favorable recognition on the part of individuals; it falls away
   powerless where it meets with extended resistance; but when raised to
   the state of social right or law, it Can itself compel recognition in
   the face of such resistance,--can force its opposers to submit
   themselves to general rationality as incarnated in the law. Just as
   mere custom is society-virtue as sentiment, so is law
   society-character,--with firm will-force for carrying itself out.
   Custom is, as it were, the heart-rich idealistic bride-state of public
   morality; right as enunciated in law is its marriage-state with the
   full earnestness of obligation; the former rests on the discretion of
   the individual; the latter binds the individual unconditionally and
   with the power of active compulsion. That is surely a very bad legal
   condition of society where right is accomplished only by coercion and
   fear; and the normal condition of society is that where the law is
   inscribed in, and a vital force of, every individual heart, and that,
   too, as law and not as a mere and, as it were, simply beseeching
   custom; and where it does not find free recognition, there it should
   not bow its head and suffer in silence, but it has been intrusted by
   God with the sword for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise
   of them that do well [1 Pet. ii, 14; Rom. xiii, 1-4]. That would be a
   bad-ordered family where the father, as against his disobedient
   children, merely be, wailed in inactivity,--where he should not
   virtualize his true moral love by palpable chastisement; and organized
   society has, as the higher-developed family, also the love-duty of
   coercion and penal chastisement. Morality cannot and ought not to have
   a merely subjective form; it should attain also to objective
   reality,--should become a power above the individual person, and that,
   too, not as merely conceived, but as having full reality; and this
   condition is realized only in the fact that right or objective morality
   is not a mere thought, a mere written code, but that it has its
   personal upholders and executors; this is not merely human order, it is
   divine order.--As the highest form of the moral community-life,
   positively-organized society cannot do away with the earlier stages,
   the family and society in the larger sense of the word,--but as it is
   itself based upon them, it must necessarily contain them within itself,
   and foster and promote them. A state which, as was the case with
   Plato's, swallows up the family is totally illegitimate and in utter
   conflict with the moral idea. That unlimited autocracy of the state
   which assumes to be the sole and absolute source of right is a heathen
   notion, and, within the Christian world, anti-moral.

  SECTION CLII.

   The difference, as necessarily existing in every moral communion, of
   the morally-advanced and the morally less-matured, and which finds its
   first expression in the relation of parents and children, forms also
   the basis of organized society. In this society the duty of forming, of
   guiding and of educating falls mainly to the former; that of
   appropriating and obeying, to the latter. The guiding rests entirely on
   morally-religious culture, and aims by general forming to make of
   society a moral art-work, a moral organism. The difference between the
   guiding or ruling ones and the guided and obeying ones, is therefore
   per se strictly identical with the difference between the morally and
   religiously higher-developed (the prophets and priests) and the as yet
   to-be-developed, namely, the general public, the body of society. In so
   far as the moral organism expresses the antithesis of priest-prophets
   and people-congregation in the sphere of religion, it is the church; in
   so far as it expresses the antithesis of the ruling and the ruled in
   the sphere of law or right, it is the state. In a normally constituted
   and absolutely sin-free society church and state are perfectly
   identical, and the moral organism appears as a theocracy; its definite
   popular form would be a fully developed patriarchal state. The
   religious and the legal commonalty in their perfect unity are the
   morally developed family; and as its inner law and essence are
   absolutely the moral law itself, which rules at the same time as a
   vital power in the hearts of all its members, hence the
   theocratically-organized religiously-moral society is the historical
   realization of the kingdom of God on earth, and its perfecting is the
   goal of all rationally-moral effort, of the individual as well as of
   society as a whole; and the spiritual and moral development of humanity
   toward this ultimate end forms universal history.

   We have nothing to do here with the actual church and the actual state,
   which are both essentially conditioned on, and constituted in view of
   combating, sin, but with the ideal moral community-life which is free
   of all sin. The family continues to be the moral basis and the pattern.
   The inner difference between the guiding and the guided can, in a
   sinless state of things, be only of a very mild and a merely relatively
   valid character. In a perfect religious community all the mature
   members are of priestly character, are invested with the duty of
   spiritual guidance; and in a perfect civil society all the mature
   citizens participate in the spiritual and moral guidance of the whole;
   and the more perfect the collective development of all the members, so
   much the more does the fundamental relation of fathers and children
   retire into the back-ground, and assume rather the form of the gentler
   antithesis of the two sexes in marriage.

   As in the normal family, religious and moral life are united, and the
   father is also the spiritual and priestly guide of the religious life,
   hence in the ideal social organism, church and state are simply one and
   the same thing; they are but two absolutely inseparable phases of the
   same spiritual life. All religion becomes social reality, and all
   social life rests on religion; the normal state is also a church,. and
   the true church develops out of itself a corresponding social
   community-life,--as was seen in the early Christian church, and as, in
   recent times, the Unitas Fratrum, from a correct presentiment of the
   goal of Christian history, has partially carried out. That the father
   of the people should also be the chief bishop, is implied in the
   prototype of the moral commonalty; but whether in this particular the
   ideal is to be applied to the very unideal present reality of the
   world, it is not here the place to decide. The patriarchal state is the
   primitive manner of morally organizing society,--the one most nearly
   related to the family prototype; and the family-chief of the closely
   related tribe is at once its chief leader and its priest; lie
   represents, however, not his single personal will, but the moral will
   of the whole, which is in turn itself a faithful expression of the
   divine will. For this simple reason the ideal form of the social state
   is necessarily and essentially a theocracy; for it is only in a vital
   communion with God that the rulers of the people have their right,
   their law, their power; and it is not the mere divine law that is the
   all-guiding factor, but the living personal God himself, who enlightens
   and guides his trusting children, and governs directly through his
   prophets and anointed ones. The divine right of a true magistracy is
   based on this idea, but is valid as a moral right only in so far as
   humble submission to God rules in the hearts of the rulers. The
   theocracy of the Old Testament [Exod. xix, 3-6; Deut. vii, 6 sqq.;
   xxxiii, 5; 1 Sam. viii, 6 sqq.; Isa. xxxiii, 22] is only a faint shadow
   of that which was to have been realized in sinless humanity, and of
   which as partially regained through redemption only glimpses are caught
   in prophetic vision [Isa. ii, 2; iv, 2 sqq.; ix, 6 sqq.; xi, 1 sqq.;
   xxxii, 15 sqq.: lxv, 17 sqq.; Ezek. xxxiv, 23 sqq.; xxxvi, 24 sqq.;
   xxxvii, 24 sqq.]. The mysterious phenomenon of the priest-king of
   Salem, Melchizedek [Gen. xiv, 18 sqq.; Heb. vii, 1 sqq.; Psa. cx, 4],
   like a reminiscence of a long-forgotten better age floating down into a
   totally different present,--perhaps the last scion of those who had
   remained faithful to the Covenant of Noah outside of the family of
   Abraham,--is in some respects the expression of a true theocracy as it
   exists in a higher manner only in Christ. With the Israelites royalty
   and priesthood were in fact separate; Aaron and David represent the two
   sides of the one theocratical idea; Samuel approximated this idea, but
   was more a priest than a king. The theocratical form of society was
   realized in Old Testament times only in its first beginnings, in the
   family-state of the patriarchs. The people of Israel was both outwardly
   and inwardly too little at peace both with the world and with God to be
   able to sustain a theocratical form of government; it is only in
   "Salem" that the Prince of Peace can rule.

   The moral commonalty in its double form as church and state is, on the
   one hand, a complete preserving and virtualizing of the personal moral
   freedom of the individuals, in that the collective will, as manifesting
   itself in laws and in the government, is at the same time the will of
   the individual, and on the other, a real objective presentation of the
   moral idea with a determining power for and over the individual, but
   which acts as a limit to the freedom of the individual only when this
   freedom has fallen from its harmony with God into irrational caprice.
   In the ideal state all morality becomes right or law, and all law is a
   pure expression of morality. When this moral commonalty has become a
   full reality, then it is the kingdom of God as having attained to
   historical form and reality. The kingdom of God comes not, it is true,
   with outward show [Luke xvii, 20, 21], inasmuch as it exists primarily
   in the hearts of men; but when it has come into the hearts of men--when
   God has assumed form within them--then will also the kingdom of God
   itself take upon itself a form, and the collective history of the
   God-imbued portion of humanity (the true church) is simply this
   gradually self-developing form. As soon, however, as sin has entered
   into reality, then church and state at once fall apart, and dissolve
   themselves in turn into discordant and contradictory subdivisions, and
   the kingdom of everlasting peace becomes a plurality of kingdoms of
   endless strife. The moral or ideal destination of universal history is,
   to be the uniformly undisturbed evolution of the kingdom of God; to
   confound its criminal reality with the unclouded ideal, is to deny
   ethical moral truth. But universal history, in its pure and normal
   form, is the development of humanity as unitary (§ 88); of this
   humanity the statement would hold good in the most perfect manner, that
   "the whole earth was of one language and of one speech" [Gen. xi, 1].

   far as entirely to exclude it from his work. He declares the word as
   "scientifically inadmissible," inasmuch as it is devoid of "accurately
   determined logical contents;"--it is but a popular expression for the
