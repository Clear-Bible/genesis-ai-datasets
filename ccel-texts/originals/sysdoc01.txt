PREFACE.

   SYSTEMATIC Divinity is considered and treated, by many, with slight and
   contempt. And if a book be written in this form, and published under
   the title of a System or Body of Divinity, this is a sufficient reason,
   with them, to neglect it, as not worthy their attention. But can this
   be supported by any good reason? Is not a System of Divinity as proper
   and important, as a System of Jurisprudence, Physic, or natural
   Philosophy?

   If the Bible be a revelation from heaven, it contains a System of
   consistent important Doctrines; which are so connected, and implied in
   each other, that one cannot be so well understood, if detached from all
   the rest, and considered by itself; and some must be first known,
   before others can be seen in a proper and true light. When all these
   are stated, and explained, according to Scripture, and in their true
   order, connection and dependence, a System of Doctrines is formed. This
   every person must do in some measure and degree, who understands the
   Bible. And he who would assist others in doing this, and set the
   Doctrines of Christianity in a clear light, and to the best advantage
   to be understood, will, of course, form a System of Truths. And so far
   as he falls short of this, or deviates from it, he must be defective
   and confused.

   If the following System do indeed contain the chief and most important
   doctrines of Christianity; and they be, in any good measure, explained
   and vindicated, shewing their consistence and connection with each
   other, the reader, it is hoped, will get some advantage by it. If it
   should be thought by any that it contains great errors and
   inconsistencies, it is to be wished, for their sake, and for the sake
   of truth, that they would not confidently rest in their conclusion, or
   drop the subject, till they are able to fix on a system of truths more
   consistent, and which can be better supported by the scripture, and are
   more agreeable to sound reason.

   It is presumed, the author will not be suspected of going through the
   labour of composing the following work with a view of rendering himself
   popular, and obtaining the general applause; or that he has sought to
   "please men." The most that can be reasonably expected, is, that it may
   serve to confirm the friends of truth in the doctrines contained in the
   scripture; and enlighten some of those who have been in the dark
   respecting some truths, and have been inconsistent with themselves in
   the doctrines they have espoused: And that it may assist the honest
   inquirers to see what are the leading and most important doctrines of
   divine revelation; particularly those who are candidates for the
   evangelical ministry.

   It is not pretended that every doctrine of Christianity is expressly
   mentioned in this System; but that the most important and essential
   truths are brought into view: And of these some are treated more
   concisely; and others are more particularly examined and vindicated, as
   was judged most convenient and useful. Nor was it thought necessary, or
   expedient, to mention all the objections which have been made to the
   doctrines here advanced, as they are sufficiently obviated, by
   establishing the truth, from scripture and reason; and as this would
   have enlarged the work to an undesirable length: Those only are
   mentioned, by an answer to which, the truth is more explained and
   established.

   The same sentiments are brought into view, and repeated, in a number of
   instances; which could not well be avoided, in such a work: And it is
   hoped, that such repetitions will not be inconvenient or tedious to the
   reader.

   To the most correct and elegant style, the author makes no pretension;
   as this is not his talent. If the words and expressions be not
   ambiguous, but are suited to convey the ideas, designed to be
   communicated to the mind of the reader, with ease and clearness, the
   chief and most important end of language is answered: And it is hoped,
   that they who are, with proper attention and concern, inquiring after
   the truth, will exercise so much candour, as not to be offended, or
   slight it, though it be not expressed in words and a style, more
   agreeable to their nice and critical taste; and they may observe a
   number of inaccuracies.

   This work has been undertaken and prosecuted, under a conviction, that
   a performance of this kind is much wanted; and, if well executed, would
   be very useful, and greatly serve the cause of truth and religion. It
   is to be wished there were a more able hand, disposed to execute it:
   But as none appeared to do it, the author has done his best. Yet he
   doubts not that there are many defects; and is not confident that he
   has made no mistakes in less important points; while he has not the
   least doubt that the chief and leading doctrines here advanced are
   contained in the Bible, and are important and everlasting truths: And
   that all those sentiments, and schemes of doctrine and religion, which
   are wholly inconsistent with these, and contrary to them, are not
   consistent with the Bible, or with one another; and, if followed in
   their just consequences, will lead to universal scepticism, and, which
   is the same indeed, to the horrible darkness of atheism itself.

   The truth is great, and has omnipotence to support it; and therefore
   will prevail: And all erroneous doctrines, and false religion, will be
   utterly abolished. And there is no reason to doubt, that light wall so
   increase in the church, and men will be raised up, who will make such
   advances in opening the scripture, and in the knowledge of divine
   truth; that what is now done and written, will be so far superseded, as
   to appear imperfect and inconsiderable, compared with that superior
   light, with which the church will then be blessed. Nevertheless, if
   publishing that to which we have now attained, may be a mean of making
   such advances, and a proper and necessary step to it, the labour and
   expense of doing it, will be abundantly compensated.

CHAP. I.

  CONCERNING DIVINE REVELATION.

   IT is evident from reason, fact and experience, that mankind stand in
   need of a revelation from God, in order to know what God is--what is
   their own true state and moral character--whether he be reconcileable
   to them, who have rebelled against him--and if he be, what is the
   method he has appointed, in which he will be reconciled; and what man
   must be and do, in order to find acceptance in his sight: Wherein true
   happiness consists--whether there be another state--what are the
   favours he will grant in a future state, to those who serve and please
   him in this life--what are his grand designs in creating and governing
   the world, &c. The ignorance and uncertainty, with respect to these
   most important points, in which all men have been and still are, who
   have enjoyed no such revelation, is a constant, striking evidence of
   this.

   There are, indeed, those who refuse to admit this evidence; and insist
   that human reason alone, unassisted by any revelation, except what is
   made in the works of creation and providence, is sufficient to
   investigate every necessary and important truth; and therefore think
   themselves authorized to reject and despise every other revelation that
   pretends to come from God, as the contrivance and production of
   designing, or weak, deluded men. But while they entertain so high an
   opinion of human reason, and especially their own, in the face of the
   glaring evidence from fact and experiment, just now mentioned, they
   have produced an incontestible evidence of their own sad mistake; for
   upon examination, the writings of the deists are found to contain
   numerous contradictions to each other, on points of the highest moment;
   and most of them have embraced for truth, many tenets most unreasonable
   and absurd. Thus, when they have renounced revelation, and boasted of
   their own reason, and relied upon that, as a sufficient and infallible
   guide, they have all, or most of them, run into darkness and delusion.
   And at the same time, there is abundant evidence, that all the real
   light and knowledge they appear to have in divine things, which they
   attribute to the unassisted exercise of their own reason, and which is
   more than the benighted heathen have, originated from that very
   revelation, which they discard and despise. With great propriety
   therefore they have been compared to a man who is in a room,
   illuminated by the bright shining of a candle, and thereby is assisted
   to behold the objects around him distinctly: But being ignorant of the
   assistance which he has from the candle, imagines he discerns those
   objects by the strength of his own sight; and therefore despises and
   endeavours to extinguish that light, which, if withdrawn, would leave
   him wholly in the dark. [1] Besides, there is this farther evidence
   against them, and in favour of the revelation which they renounce, viz.
   It does not appear, that by all their writings and attempts, they have
   made any reformation in the morals of men, or that so much as one man
   has been reclaimed from a vicious course of life, and become sober,
   humble, benevolent, pious and devout, by being made a convert to them:
   But, on the contrary, most, if not all their disciples, are of a
   character directly the reverse of this; and they are most admired by
   men of vicious character, or who at least are evidently without those
   virtues which are essential to constitute a truly religious man.

   Moreover, if the revelation they discard represents men to be in such a
   state of depravity and vicious blindness, as to be disposed to shut
   their eyes against the clearest light, and to treat it as these men in
   fact do treat the Bible; and foretells this same treatment and conduct
   of theirs, as it certainly does; while they are thus slighting and
   rejecting it, they are really giving a strong evidence of its divine
   original.

   But, to return: The usefulness and necessity of such a revelation is
   abundantly evident from fact, and has been implicitly or expressly
   acknowledged by many of the most wise and inquisitive among the
   heathen. [2] Hence we may conclude, that God has given one to men: And
   when we find ourselves in possession of a book which has all the marks
   and evidence that we can reasonably expect or desire, that it is indeed
   from God, and suited to answer all the ends of a divine revelation, we
   shall be very criminal, if we do not receive it with gratitude, and
   improve it to promote all the important purposes for which it is given.

   Such a revelation we find to be contained in the book called the Bible,
   or the holy scriptures. For while all other pretended revelations from
   God, which have been, or now are found among men, are without all
   proper evidence of their being such, and carry evident marks of
   imposture, which has been abundantly demonstrated, by those who have
   examined them: This has stood the test of the severest scrutiny both of
   its friends and enemies, and the more it has been examined, the more
   clearly does it appear, that all the objections which have been made
   against it are futile and groundless; and that there is sufficient and
   abundant evidence, that it is from God, suited to give satisfaction and
   a well grounded assurance of its divine original, to every impartial,
   honest mind.

   The first part of this book was written by Moses, after he had given
   abundant evidence, by a series of astonishing miracles, done in the
   sight of the Egyptians, and all Israel, that he spake and acted, under
   the influence and direction of the supreme Ruler of the universe, and
   had sufficiently established his character, as a prophet divinely
   inspired. Moses said he was sent by Jehovah, the only true God, the God
   of Israel, to demand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let his people
   go out from under his oppressive hand; and foretold that if he refused
   to do it, God would slay his first born son. Pharaoh said he knew not
   who Jehovah was, and bid defiance to him, declaring he would pay no
   regard to his demand. This gave opportunity for an open trial and
   decision, whether Jehovah, the God of Israel, was the true God, or the
   gods of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The priests and the magicians of
   Egypt were collected, and entered the dispute with Moses. They wrought
   several miracles, in imitation of those which Moses did in the name of
   the God of Israel; but there was an evident, decided superiority in
   those wrought by Jehovah. And the contest went on, till at length they
   were not able to stand before Moses, and confessed publicly that
   Jehovah was God, and superior to theirs. Moses went on doing wonders,
   in the sight of all Egypt, and inflicting various successive judgments
   on Pharaoh, and on the Egyptians; at the same time particularly
   foretelling the miraculous chastisement which Jehovah had revealed to
   him he would inflict. At length, Moses informed Pharaoh, that if he
   should still persist in refusing to let Israel go out of Egypt, Jehovah
   had said to him, that he would slay all the first born in Egypt; and
   this was foretold to all Israel; which accordingly came to pass: And
   the Egyptians were made to fear and tremble before the God of Israel,
   and entreated his people to pray to him for them, acknowledging he was
   the supreme God. Thus Israel went out of Egypt, as Jehovah had promised
   they should, and were led through the Red Sea, the waters dividing to
   make them a way, at the direction and command of their God; while
   Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who were so hardy as to follow them, were
   all drowned in the waters. Thus Jehovah publicly triumphed over all the
   gods of Egypt, and executed judgment upon them; and by the fullest and
   most incontestible evidence established his character as the only true
   God. The people of Israel felt, and solemnly acknowledged this, at the
   Red Sea; and they were led on by the hand of Moses, attended with a
   constant course of miracles, unto Mount Sinai. On that Mount, God
   appeared in a manner suited to manifest his presence and awful glorious
   majesty, and excite their utmost attention, fear and reverence; and
   then, from the top of the mountain, out of the fire, with a voice that
   could be distinctly heard by all that vast multitude, consisting of at
   least three millions of people, he spake the ten commandments, and
   added no more. They were after wards written on two tables of stone, by
   the finger of God; which was most probably the first writing by letters
   in this world: [3] And Moses, being taught of God to read it, and so
   how to write, was directed and inspired by God to write the history of
   the creation of the world, and the events which had taken place since;
   and of mankind, so far as was necessary these things should be recorded
   and known; and, more particularly, the history of the origin of the
   Hebrews, and the events of divine providence respecting them. As this
   is the first, and oldest, so it is the only authentic history of the
   creation of the world, and of mankind, from the beginning to that time,
   which is an era of about two thousand five hundred years. Moses also
   wrote a code of laws for that people, which he said were dictated to
   him by God, containing many promises and threatenings, together with a
   number of typical institutions, which were shadows of things to come.
   And there are many predictions in his writings, which have already come
   to pass; especially that God would raise up unto them that great
   prophet, the Messiah, of whom he himself was a type; and if they would
   not hear him, they should be destroyed.

   God having thus established his character, as the only true God, by
   abundant and most clear evidence; and magnified Moses in the sight of
   the Egyptians and all Israel, as his servant and prophet, directed and
   inspired by him both to do, and to say, all that he did and said, in
   the name of Jehovah; he forbid them to hearken to a prophet, or any
   other person, who should arise and do wonders and miracles, not in the
   name of Jehovah, but of some other god, with a view to draw them away
   from obedience to the God of Israel, to worship and serve other gods.
   And every one who will attentively consider the subject, must at once
   see both the reasonableness of this injunction, and the wisdom and
   goodness of God in laying a proper foundation for it, and then giving
   it by Moses to Israel. For Jehovah having given all the evidence that
   could be reasonably expected or desired, by a series of public
   incontestible miracles, appearances, words and works, that he was the
   only true God; which all Israel had, under the fullest and most
   rational conviction, acknowledged, over and over again, and under this
   conviction, solemnly given themselves up to him, as their God; and
   promised to renounce all other gods, and cleave to, and obey Jehovah
   alone, as their God: It became them never from that time to call in
   question what had been made so abundantly evident, but with the
   greatest assurance, and the most sincere abhorrence, reject every thing
   which was evidently contrary to the light and revelation they had
   received; and not pay the least regard to any wonders and miracles,
   pretended to be done, or really wrought, to prove that Jehovah was not
   the only true God, and in favour of other gods.

   These things have been observed, to show with what abundant evidence
   and assurance the church of Israel received the writings of Moses, as
   divine oracles, the infallible dictates of Heaven, which he was
   inspired to reveal and communicate; while it is at the same time
   acknowledged there are many other things which have not been here
   brought into view, which serve to strengthen this evidence, and show
   that to make any other supposition, and not to admit these writings as
   the oracles of Heaven, is most absurd, shutting the eyes against the
   most glaring light, and doing violence to every principle of reason.

   After Moses, other prophets and inspired men were raised up to write
   the history of that nation; to declare the will of God, in reproving,
   directing and exhorting; and adding threatenings and promises, to deter
   them from rebellion against Jehovah, and excite them to obey him. Whose
   writings also contain innumerable predictions of things to come, many
   of which are already come to pass; those in particular which foretold
   the coming of the Messiah, his incarnation, death, resurrection,
   exaltation and reign: and the events that should attend his coming with
   regard both to Jews and Gentiles, &c. &c. And in these writings there
   is a constant reference to the things contained in the writings of
   Moses, the wonders wrought by his hand, when they were delivered from a
   state of bondage in Egypt, &c. and to the institutions and laws, which
   by him were given to Israel: And at the same time there is a perfect
   consistence and harmony, between these writings and those of Moses.

   The last prophet, whose writings we have, lived about four hundred
   years before Christ; so that the sacred writings which were given to
   the church of Israel, and which they received as divine oracles, and
   have carefully kept and preserved, not only to the time of the
   incarnation of Christ, but even down to this day, were written at
   different times, by different men, through the space of above a
   thousand years, from Moses the first, to Malachi, the last writer. And
   yet they all agree; and the latter constantly refer to the writings of
   Moses, and what is contained in them; and therefore they mutually
   strengthen the evidence, that they all wrote by inspiration, as most of
   them declared they did. And Malachi concludes with foretelling the
   coming of Christ, and directing the church of Israel to attend to the
   laws and institutions of Moses, and obey them, until Christ should
   come; and to expect no more divine revelation, till that time; plainly
   intimating, that then some further revelations from God should be given
   to the church. [4] Thus the standing, written revelation, given lo the
   Jewish church, was finished; and they were commanded not to attempt to
   make, or expect any addition to it, till the days of the Messiah.

   Should it be said, that perhaps all these writings were forged by some
   wicked, designing man, or set of men, and that the facts and miracles
   therein related never did take place, nor was Moses, or any other man,
   inspired of God to write these things; but they were imposed upon that
   nation, and they were made to believe that which never had any reality:
   Such a supposition will appear most unreasonable, and even impossible,
   on the least reflection. When, and how, could this be done? How could
   that nation, even all of them, old and young, learned and unlearned, at
   any time be made to believe that all these things related in the
   writings of Moses, concerned them, and which he said took place
   publicly, and that they were seen and acknowledged by the whole nation;
   and that all those rites and laws had been received in a miraculous way
   from Jehovah, by their ancestors, and handed down, and practised from
   generation to generation, if there was no truth in all this; but they
   were all novo invented, and they never had any existence, or were heard
   of before, by any of them? This is perfectly incredible, and absolutely
   impossible. And it is equally incredible, that a whole nation should at
   any time receive such writings, and pretend they were all genuine and
   true, and handed down from their fathers, when at the same time they
   knew there was no truth in it, but was real imposture and delusion. Who
   can believe, that any nation or people under heaven, could ever be
   brought to do this; and receive and practise all those burdensome rites
   and ceremonies, and hand them down to their children as the
   institutions of Heaven, when they knew it was all a cheat? And this
   will appear yet more incredible, if possible, when we observe, that
   these writings give no agreeable, flattering idea of that nation, as a
   wise, excellent, and honourable people; but contrary to this, they are
   represented as a very stupid, ungrateful, rebellious people, always
   disposed to abuse and revolt from their God, and violate the most
   sacred obligations and solemn vows, by which they were constantly
   incurring the displeasure of Jehovah; and were severely punished, from
   time to time, for their horrid impiety, and most stupid idolatry, and
   their obstinate perseverance in shameful unrighteousness and cruelty
   towards each other. If a people could forge and receive a history of
   themselves as a nation, in which there was no truth; or if it were
   contrived and formed by any set of men, or by any one man among them,
   with a design to impose it on the nation, to be received by them as
   genuine; we may be sure it would be written in favour of that nation,
   and so as to flatter their selfishness, pride, and vanity, instead of
   representing them, as these writings do that nation, in a disagreeable,
   shameful, odious light.

   Besides, these writings have no marks, not the least appearance of
   imposture and forgery, when most critically examined; but all
   appearance that can be desired, that they are genuine, and were written
   at the different times, and in the different circumstances, in which
   they are said to have been written, and by those different men:
   Whereas, if they were a forgery, and not written by inspiration, it
   cannot be supposed possible, they should carry all those marks of
   genuineness, and none of the contrary.

   Moreover, they contain a system of truths, and point out and enjoin
   commands and duties to God and our neighbour, which bespeak their
   divine original, and are worthy to be revealed by God; and which no
   ungodly, selfish, designing impostor, and such these writers must be,
   if they wrote not by inspiration, would ever think of, and much less be
   disposed to publish and enjoin.

   The promised Messiah at length made his appearance in the world, even
   at the very time in which it was foretold he should come! the way for
   his coming having been prepared by his harbinger, as was particularly
   predicted by Isaiah; and by Malachi, in the last words of the Old
   Testament.

   It having been abundantly proved, as has been ob» served and shown,
   that Jehovah, the God of Israel, was the only true God, and that the
   writings in their hands were given by divine inspiration, in which the
   coming of the Messiah and his future kingdom were foretold, and
   particularly described; all that was now necessary, in order to his
   being on good ground received as king of the church, was to give proper
   evidence that he was the very person, the promised Saviour of the
   world. This was done not only by his appearing at the time, and in the
   character and circumstances, which were foretold by the prophets; but
   by working a series of miracles, done in a public manner: And by his
   predicting many things, which soon came to pass, especially his own
   death, and the particular circumstances of it; and that he would rise
   again on the third day. He was accordingly put to death, which his
   enemies as well as friends confess; and if he did rise again, as he
   said he would, the evidence that he was the Messiah, the same Jehovah
   who was the God of Israel, would be complete, and none could reasonably
   desire more.

   That he did rise on the third day; and when he had continued on earth
   above forty days, conversing with his disciples and friends, and giving
   them instructions and commands, left the world and ascended to heaven,
   there were a competent number of chosen witnesses, who declared they
   were eye and ear witnesses of this; and that they had the most
   satisfactory, full and abundant evidence of it. And farther, to prove
   the truth of it, they had power to work innumerable miracles in the
   name of Jesus of Nazareth, as a testimony that he was alive, and
   consequently the Son of God, and Saviour of the world. And they gave up
   all their worldly interest in this cause; and subjected themselves to
   poverty, hatred and reproach of men; and to various hardships and cruel
   sufferings, and even to death, in bearing witness to this truth, and
   those that are implied in it, and preaching the gospel; which was
   attended by an invisible mighty power, purifying and renewing the
   hearts of multitudes, and leading them to renounce their former
   delusions and wicked ways, and to believe in Christ, and obey him; who
   became so many witnesses of the truth and power of Christianity.

   A history of these things was written by those who had the most certain
   knowledge of them, and intimate acquaintance with them, giving an
   account of the birth, life, death and resurrection of Christ; and of
   the doctrines which he taught, and the instructions and commands he
   gave, and the miracles which were wrought by him, &c. &c. Also, a
   history was written of what took place for a number of years after the
   ascension of Christ to heaven; the promised gift of his Spirit to the
   apostles and others, whereby they were enabled to speak different
   languages, and to work miracles: Their bearing testimony for Christ,
   and preaching with great success, not only to the Jews, but to the
   Gentile nations, and erecting churches in many parts of the world, Sec.
   This history of Christ and his apostles is written in a manner
   remarkably different from that of any other history written by men not
   inspired. It is simple, plain and concise, consisting only in the most
   intelligible narration of facts, of what was said and done, without
   justifying or condemning any person; not giving the least encomium, or
   bestowing any praise on Christ himself, or any of his friends, nor
   saying a word in their favour; not reproaching or condemning their
   enemies, or any person, or speaking against them: but confining
   themselves to a plain history of simple facts, without any comments of
   their own, against any one, or in favour of him. This, by the way, is a
   striking evidence, among others innumerable, that these writings, "came
   not by the will of man;" but were composed under the direction and
   superintendency of the Holy Ghost, the authors being inspired and moved
   by him. [5]

   We have also the writings of several of the apostles of Christ,
   containing a number of letters, which they wrote to churches, and to
   some particular persons, in which the doctrines and duties of
   Christianity, and the institutions and laws of Christ, are more
   particularly explained and inculcated. And last of all, there is a
   book, called "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which he sent and
   signified by his angel unto his servant John." This the apostle John w
   rote in his advanced age, after the destruction of Jerusalem by the
   Romans, when he was suffering for the cause of Christ, being banished
   to a desolate island, after his character had been long established as
   an apostle of Christ, by miracles, and a holy life. He says, he
   received this revelation from Christ, and was by him directed to write
   it, just as he here has done. It contains, among other things, a
   representation of the state of the church, and the great events that
   should take place respecting it, from that time to the end of the
   world, and of its perfect and glorious state from that period forever
   and ever; and of the endless punishment of all her implacable enemies.
   And many of the predictions in this book have been already
   accomplished: others are daily fulfilling before our eyes, which is a
   constant miracle, of the most indisputable kind, evidencing the divine
   original of this prophecy; and that the things therein foretold, which
   are not yet come to pass, will all be accomplished in their season.

   And as the divine inspired writings, given to the Jewish church,
   conclude with an intimation that they should have nothing more of this
   kind, till the promised Messiah did come, and a command carefully to
   keep and observe what they had received; so this book concludes with a
   declaration, that there should be no addition to divinely inspired
   writings, given to the christian church; and therefore mankind must
   look for no more; but are commanded carefully to observe and obey what
   was then revealed, without adding any thing to it, or taking from it,
   until Christ shall come to judgment.

   God having thus completed a revelation containing every thing he saw
   necessary and proper, to make it a sufficient, perfect, and unerring
   rule for his church to the end of the world; and every way adapted to
   answer all the desired ends of a divine revelation; attended with all
   the evidence that can be reasonably desired, that it is from God, and
   the whole that he ever will give; the use and end of miracles has of
   course ceased; and therefore the church is to expect no more, or any
   more prophets inspired to foretel things to come, not already foretold
   in the holy scriptures. And whatever pretences any may make of working
   miracles, and whatever miracles may be really wrought, in support of
   any pretended truths or institutions, or system of religion, the church
   of Christ has no liberty to pay the least regard to them; but ought to
   renounce all such pretences with abhorrence; and to hearken to them,
   and regard them in the least, is to renounce the Bible, and the God who
   has given it to his church. Nor have we any warrant to pay the least
   regard to any who pretend to a spirit of prophecy; even though the
   things they foretel, come to pass; but, on the contrary, ought wholly
   to disregard and renounce such pretences, being certain from divine
   revelation, that they are not from God, and cannot in the least
   strengthen the evidence of the divine authority of the Bible, or of any
   truth contained in it: but have a contrary tendency: And to pay any
   regard to them is really to slight the Bible, and may give Satan an
   advantage, and opportunity to introduce the most gross and fatal
   delusions. [6]

   This general view of the holy scriptures, and the observations that
   have been made, are designed to exhibit no inconsiderable part of the
   evidence we have, that they do indeed contain a revelation from God,
   and may with the greatest safety be relied upon as such. But there are
   many other evidences of this, some of which ought to be brought into
   view, when this subject is considered. And it may be proper now to
   mention a number of arguments to prove that the writings contained in
   the Bible are a revelation from God, in which several things that have
   been already hinted will be included.

   I. The series of miracles which have been wrought, as a testimony that
   this revelation is from God, is a standing, undeniable proof of it.
   These have been in some measure brought into view, in the observations
   above; from which the propriety and importance of these miracles, and
   the end for which they were wrought, appear. That these miracles were
   really wrought, we have as great evidence as the nature of the case
   will admit; and not the least ground of suspicion and doubt; especially
   when we consider the times and circumstances of them, and their
   apparent design, and the nature and contents of the revelation, the
   credit of which they are designed to establish. These things have been
   particularly and largely considered by many, and therefore are only
   mentioned here, except the last, which will be attended to in the
   sequel.

   II. The numerous prophecies which are contained in the Bible, with
   their exact accomplishment, are a standing, clear evidence, that it is
   a revelation from God. The certain independent foreknowledge of future
   events, or of any thing to come, all will grant, belongs to the true
   God alone. Therefore we find Jehovah challenging this as his own
   prerogative; and his declaring what will be, and bringing it to pass
   accordingly, is asserted to be a demonstration that it is the true God
   who speaks. And he says, that he who can do this, does prove himself to
   be God. "Produce your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your strong
   reasons, saith the king of Jacob. Let them bring them forth, and shew
   what shall happen.--Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we
   may know that ye are gods." "I, even I am the Lord, and beside me there
   is no Saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when
   there was no strange god among you: Therefore, ye are my witnesses,
   saith the Lord, that I am God." When Jehovah brought Israel out of
   Egypt, he demonstrated that he was the only true God, and they
   renounced all other gods; then he foretold what would befall them, both
   in promises and threatenings, and a great number of predictions, which
   had actually come to pass in their sight: Therefore they were his
   witnesses, as they were witnesses of this fact, which was sufficient to
   support his character, as the only true God, in opposition to all other
   pretended gods. Jehovah tells them that one end of his thus foretelling
   events, and then bringing them to pass, was to give them an undeniable
   proof that he was the true God, who spoke to them by Moses, &c. and
   leave them inexcusable, if they should acknowledge any other God. "I
   have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth
   out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came
   to pass. Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
   iron sinew, and thy brow brass; I have even from the beginning declared
   it to thee: Before it came to pass, I shewed it thee, lest thou
   shouldest say mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my
   molten image, hath commanded them." [7]

   Though they had in many other ways good evidence that he was the true
   God, in whose name Moses spake and acted; yet God, knowing their evil
   disposition, and how prone they were to unbelief, and to turn away from
   him to other gods, in his great condescension and goodness, took care
   to give and heap up more abundant standing evidence that they had
   indeed the oracles of the true God, who was the God of Israel, by
   foretelling innumerable events, and then bringing them to pass before
   their eyes. When Moses wrought the numerous signs and wonders in Egypt,
   he foretold these events before they took place: And so most of the
   miracles wrought by the hand of Moses at the Red Sea, and in the
   wilderness, were foretold immediately before they took place: And also
   many things of which we have an account in the books of Joshua, Judges,
   and the two books of Samuel, &c. To such predictions as these, which
   were brought to pass immediately, the above cited words seem to have
   particular reference: God says, "They went forth out of my mouth, and I
   shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass." In this way
   they had not only the evidence which the miracles themselves gave of
   the truth, in favour of which they were wrought; but the prediction and
   the immediate accomplishment, was a yet farther evidence that he who
   wrought the miracle spoke and acted under the influence, and according
   to the dictates of the omniscient God. In this way were most of the
   miracles wrought by Christ and his apostles.

   But there are almost innumerable prophecies in the Bible which foretel
   things to come, that were not to take place immediately; but a long
   time, and numbers of them many ages after the predictions were
   published. Many predictions of this kind are contained in the writings
   of Moses, which foretel a multitude of events respecting that nation,
   which have been exactly fulfilled. And indeed great part of the
   religious institutions and worship enjoined in the Mosaic ritual, are
   so many prophecies of what should take place in the person, character,
   and kingdom of Christ, as they are appointed types and shadows of these
   things, and have been exactly fulfilled in them. This is particularly
   attended to and illustrated in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This is a
   strong argument that these institutions and laws, were made by the only
   true God, who knows what is to come, even all his own designs, and
   works that are future.

   A great part of the writings of Moses and the prophets are prophecies
   that respect Christ, his incarnation, his sufferings, and the glory
   that should follow in the salvation of men, and his kingdom. Jn these
   writings it is foretold that he should l3e the seed of Abraham by
   Isaac, that he should be of the tribe of Judah, and the family of
   David: Should be born of a virgin, in the town of Bethlehem; that he
   should be poor and despised, rejected, hated and put to death by the
   Jews and Gentiles, joining together to perpetrate this horrid deed. The
   particular time of his appearance and death is pointed out; and a great
   number of particulars relating to his life, death and resurrection are
   foretold; all which have been exactly fulfilled. They also foretel the
   rejection of the Jews, and calling of the Gentiles to be the people of
   God, and share in the blessings of Christ's kingdom; and speak much of
   the extent and glory of his kingdom, and particularly foretel that it
   should rise, prevail, and fill the world after the ruin of the Roman
   monarchy, and shall continue forever. Christ and his apostles did
   constantly appeal to these prophecies, as most plainly, and with die
   greatest exactness predicting what took place in Jesus of Nazareth.
   Christ himself, after his death .aid resurrection, addresses those who
   were wholly at a loss what to think of these things, in the following
   words; "O, fools, and slow of heart, to believe all that the prophets
   have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to
   enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he
   expounded unto them, in all the scriptures, the things concerning
   himself." The apostle Peter publicly appeals to them, and says, "God
   hath spoken of these things by the mouth of all the prophets, since the
   world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a prophet shall the
   Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me. And it
   shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that prophet,
   shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets
   from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have
   likewise foretold of these days." And St. Paul declares, that in
   bearing testimony to the truth of Christianity, and preaching the
   gospel, he asserted "no other things than those which the prophets and
   Moses did say should come." And with this argument, taken from the
   fulfilment of prophecies in Jesus of Nazareth, the first preachers of
   the gospel often put to silence, and confounded the opposing Jews, and
   convinced many, that Jesus was the Christ.

   The writings of the New Testament contain many predictions. Christ
   particularly foretold his death, and his resurrection on the third day
   after--Who should betray him, and who should deny him--The gift of the
   Spirit to the apostles in his miraculous powers--What treatment they
   should receive from the Jews--What support they should have; and what
   should be their success. He in a very particular manner foretold the
   calamities that should come on the nation of the Jews, and the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the temple; and said this should come to
   pass before all that generation did go off the stage of life. And
   though to human appearance, these events were not merely improbable,
   but even impossible; yet they all came to pass exactly agreeable to the
   prediction.

   But passing over many other instances of prophecy, both of Christ and
   his apostles, and others in the primitive church, and the particular
   fulfilment of their predictions, that remarkable one of St. Paul, [8]
   of the grand apostasy in the christian church, by the rise and reign of
   one whom he calls the man of sin and wicked one; by which the Pope and
   the false church of Rome are exactly described, together with his final
   overthrow and destruction, is worthy of particular attention. This was
   then the most incredible and unlikely to come to pass of almost any
   event whatsoever: That the Emperor of Rome should be taken out of the
   way, to give opportunity for this apostasy, and the exaltation of this
   man of sin in the church of Christ, &c. But this is all come to pass.
   And this apostasy in the church, with all its circumstances and
   attendants, together with the general state of the church, and of the
   world down to the day of judgment, are yet more particularly and fully
   foretold in the revelation which Jesus Christ gave to the apostle John
   after his ascension. In this prophecy many things are foretold, which
   were then future, and which have already come to pass; and others are
   daily fulfilling in the sight of all who have wisdom to observe and
   discern; from which there is a standing, and increasing, public
   evidence of the truth of the christian religion, sufficient to silence
   and convince all the opposers of Christianity, would they honestly
   attend to the voice of reason.

   From the view we have now taken of the prophecies, contained in the
   Bible, and their fulfilment, the following particulars may be observed.

   1. Those predictions which have been exactly fulfilled are numerous,
   and made at different times, and by different persons; and most of them
   were made publicly; and the events foretold are many of them of a
   public nature, and lie open to the examination of all. Therefore if
   they were not given by the omniscient God, it cannot be supposed the
   events would in so many instances answer to the predictions so exactly,
   and not fail in one, among so many: For this may well be considered as
   impossible.

   2. There is all the evidence that can be desired that many of these
   predictions were given long before the events took place, and while
   there was not the least ground from any thing that then appeared, to
   expect they would ever come to pass. Thus, all the prophecies in the
   Old Testament, which have been fulfilled in the days of Christ's
   appearance on earth, and of the apostles, and since, were certainly
   written and published, and in the hands of the Jewish church, long
   before the events took place. And prophecies of those things relating
   to the Pope and the church of Rome, and the kings of the earth who
   commit fornication with her, and join to support her, which have come
   to pass, and are now taking place in the world, were published, long
   before any of these things took place, or there was any appearance or
   probability that they ever would come to pass. And in many instances,
   all appearances, to human view, were against it.

   3. Those prophecies are such, and the times and manner in which they
   are given such, as become an almighty, omniscient, infinitely wise and
   good Being. They are given in an orderly manner, with an apparent good
   design, and suited to answer important ends.--To establish the
   character of those who spake and wrote in his name, as men inspired by
   God, and prove that he was the omniscient God who spoke, and so to be a
   clear standing evidence that it is a divine revelation, most evidently
   distinguished from all possible deception and imposture--To confirm the
   faith of the friends of God, and direct, support and comfort them,
   under all dark appearances and afflictions, Sec. Sec.

   Surely they who would honestly attend to these things and carefully
   consider and examine the prophecies contained in the Bible, with the
   exact fulfilment of so many of them, must be sensible that they afford
   clear and abundant evidence that the writings in this book are from
   God, as the prophecies found in it could not come by the will and
   contrivance of man; but these holy men of God evidently spake as they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost.

   III. The writings in the Old Testament, and those in the New, reflect
   light and evidence on each other, that they are from God.

   This appears from what has been observed on the preceding argument from
   prophecy: For the exact fulfilment of so many of the types and express
   predictions in the Old Testament, by the events and things of which we
   have a history in the New, does abundantly establish the credit of
   those writings as given by divine inspiration. And, at the same time,
   they prove the divine original of Christianity; and therefore that the
   writings in the New Testament are from God. And the perfect consistence
   and harmony between the writings of the Old Testament, and those of the
   New, does also afford a striking argument of the divine original of
   each of them. Moreover, Christ and his apostles constantly appeal to
   the writings of Moses and the prophets, the scriptures, as of divine
   authority, and the oracles of God. This establishes the credit of all
   those writings as given by inspiration of God, so far as the authority
   and testimony of Christ and the apostles is of any weight, and worthy
   of regard; so that if the writings in the New Testament be from God,
   the Old Testament is from him also, and is handed down to us
   uncorrupted, unless it has been corrupted since that time, which is
   many ways impossible, as might be easily shewn, were there need of it.
   At the same time, the prophecies contained in the Old Testament, of
   those very events which are recorded in the New, prove the latter to be
   from God, as has been shewn. In a word, the writings in the Old
   Testament are all established as the oracles of God, by those in the
   New: And that the writings in the New Testament are by divine
   inspiration, there is much and clear evidence from the writings of the
   Old. So that there could not be so much, so great evidence of the
   divine authority of either of them, if we had only one, without the
   other.

   The Jews did not indeed acknowledge that their scriptures were
   fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and continue as a body to reject the gospel,
   as not from God. But this is so far from being any evidence against the
   divinity of the writings of the New Testament, that it is a great
   confirmation of it. For it was foretold by the prophets, whose writings
   they acknowledge to be from God, chat they should thus reject Christ
   and the gospel, and for this be cast off by God, and the church be
   called by another name: So that their unbelief and opposition to the
   gospel, is a clear and standing evidence of the truth of it.

   IV. The great care taken by Jews and christians to receive no writings
   as divinely inspired, but those of which they had proper evidence that
   they were such; and to preserve those which they did receive as such
   from being corrupted or altered, is a further evidence that these
   writings are from God. If God has given a standing revelation to men,
   which is committed to writing, he will doubtless take care in his
   providence that it shall be received on good evidence and preserved
   uncorrupt; and that it shall be handed down to posterity in such manner
   and circumstances, as that all future generations shall have good
   evidence, that it was with proper care and caution received at first,
   and not without good evidence, that it was of divine authority; and
   that it has been handed down to them uncorrupt. And when we find the
   writings of the Bible be received and handed down to us in this manner,
   it carries an evidence that it is from God, which otherwise we could
   not have. That the writings of the Old and New Testaments have been
   thus received, and carefully preserved uncorrupt, has been abundantly
   proved by those who have written on the subject. It would swell this
   chapter beyond its designed brevity to produce this evidence at large.
   It may suffice only to observe here, that Jews and christians have been
   a guard with respect to each other, so as to render it impossible there
   should be any alteration made in the writings of the Old Testament, in
   favour of, or against either, without being detected by the other. And
   among christians, the different sects and opposite parties, which early
   sprung up in the church, made it impossible that they should agree to
   alter and corrupt those writings, which were received as divine oracles
   by them all; and if one sect or party had attempted it, they must have
   been detected by others.

   V. The consistence and harmony found in the scriptures, is another
   argument of their divine original The agreement between the writings of
   the Old Testament and those of the New has been already mentioned; but
   the agreement of every particular part with the whole, and of every
   sentiment and sentence with each other, is the fact now intended. A
   divine revelation must be perfectly consistent and harmonious
   throughout, though it consists of many parts, and be made by many
   different men, and at different times and ages distant from each other.
   Therefore if any real, material contradictions or inconsistencies can
   be found in this book, it will be a sufficient reason for rejecting it,
   as not from God. There may be seeming contradictions, at first view,
   and to a superficial reader, and to one who does not attend to it with
   honesty and candour; but with prejudice and disaffection. This we know
   to be the case with respect to human writings, in many instances, when
   the fault lies wholly in the ignorance or prejudice of the objector,
   and the upright and judicious know them to be perfectly consistent. How
   much more may we expect it will be so with respect to those writings
   which come from God, and treat of the sublime things respecting his
   being, character, kingdom, designs, laws, works, &c. and which must be
   really contrary to every wrong propensity and lust of man.

   This indeed we find to be verified: Many have thought they have found
   numerous contradictions in the Bible; and its enemies have eagerly
   searched to find them, and have used all their art and plausible
   colouring to make them appear to be real contradictions; and urged them
   with all their powers against revelation. But this has turned to the
   advantage of the holy scriptures, and been the occasion of making their
   consistence and harmony more evident and certain, than if no such
   accusation had been brought against them. For the objections of this
   kind have been critically examined, and found to be entirely
   groundless. And since all the wit and art of men of the best abilities,
   and under the greatest advantages to try, cannot find any real
   contradictions in them; and those which have been most plausibly urged,
   or have had the greatest appearance of inconsistencies, at first view,
   appear, upon careful and thorough examination, to be perfectly
   consistent, this has cast new light on the subject, and made it more
   abundantly evident and certain that there is indeed no inconsistency to
   be found in them.

   This is a very powerful argument that they are given by divine
   inspiration. For if those writings were only the contrivance of men, it
   appears impossible that so many men, who lived in different ages, of
   different natural tempers, and in such different and various
   circumstances and connections, writing on such a variety of subjects,
   with such difference of manner, style and expression, should so
   perfectly agree; and that even in those passages which at first view,
   and to a cursory, inattentive observer, may seem to contradict each
   other. There can be no parallel instance produced under heaven, of any
   number of writers thus agreeing, though they lived in the same age: and
   it is difficult to find any one author, not inspired, consistent with
   himself throughout. Therefore this consistence and harmony running
   through the writings of such a number of men, who lived in different
   ages, and which took up the space of fifteen hundred years to complete
   them, after they were begun, proves they must have been inspired by the
   all seeing, unchangeable God.

   VI. The contents of the Bible, or the truths therein revealed and the
   duties enjoined, are the greatest and crowning evidence that these
   writings are given by divine inspiration, and serve to strengthen and
   confirm all the other arguments which have been mentioned.

   This argument will of course be particularly illustrated in the
   proposed following work, in which the scriptures are to be examined, in
   order to find what are the truths and duties therein revealed and
   inculcated; what system of religion is there taught. It may be proper,
   however, to observe here in general, that we find in the Bible an
   orderly, intelligible, concise and well connected history of all those
   events which are most important and necessary to be known by the
   church, from the beginning of the world, down to the time in which this
   book was completed. The being, character, designs and works of God, are
   represented to be such as reason must approve, and pronounce
   harmonious, and becoming the true God. The state and character of man,
   and God's designs and works respecting him, are set in a clear light.
   What God requires of man, as his duty, and the way in which he may find
   acceptance with God, and be happy, are particularly stated with great
   plainness. A judgment to come, and a future state of rewards and
   punishments, are revealed. Promises to those who believe and obey the
   truth, and threatenings to the disobedient and impenitent, run through
   all those writings; and the best and strongest conceivable motives are
   set before men, to deter them from sin, and excite them to fear and
   obey God.

   Here two things may be observed,--

   1. What is revealed in the scriptures concerning the perfections and
   works of God, his laws as the rule of duty, the nature and evil
   tendency of sin, and the description given of true virtue and religion,
   and their happy tendency and end, appears so reasonable and evident to
   every attentive person, when revealed, that this, with the other
   evidences that have been mentioned, is sufficient to convince the
   reason and judgment of every one, that this is a revelation from God,
   though their hearts be ever so corrupt and vicious; and has generally
   proved sufficient, unless where peculiar prejudices by education or
   otherwise, have taken place.

   2. The honest, virtuous mind only, which does discern and relish the
   beauty and excellence of truth and virtue, will see and feel the full
   force of this argument for the divinity of the holy scriptures. Such
   have true discerning to see the wonderful, excellent, glorious things
   revealed in the holy scriptures, which in themselves carry a most
   satisfying and infallible evidence of their truth and divinity. They
   see the divine stamp which this system of truth carries on it, and
   believe and are sure that this is the true God, and that here is
   eternal life . They therefore no longer need any other evidence but
   this which they find in the contents of the holy scriptures; in this
   they rest satisfied, and are assured that the writings contained in the
   Bible are the word of God.

   Thus the holy scriptures are attended with the highest possible
   evidence that they came from God; they carry that external and internal
   evidence of their divinity, to the reason and conscience of men, which
   is sufficient to convince them, however corrupt their hearts may be:
   But the highest internal evidence is fully discerned only by the humble
   honest mind, which is disposed to relish, love and receive the truth.
   To such the true light shines from the holy scriptures with
   irresistible evidence, and their hearts are established in the truth.
   They believe from evidence they have within themselves; from what they
   see and find in the Bible. And as all might have this evidence and
   certainty that the contents of the Bible are from God, did they not
   exercise and indulge those unreasonable lusts, which blind their eyes
   to the beauty and excellence of divine truth, unbelief is in every
   instance and degree of it wholly inexcusable and very criminal.

   Having considered the abundant evidence there is that the writings
   contained in the Bible are given by divine inspiration, the following
   observations may be made concerning this sacred book.

   1. This is a complete, unerring and perfect rule of faith and practice,
   and the only rule. This being understood and believed, is sufficient to
   make men wise unto salvation; and we have no warrant to believe any
   religious truth, unless it be revealed, or can be supported by the holy
   scriptures; and this is the only rule of our duty. We may be certain,
   if God has given us a revelation, it is in all respects complete, and
   in the best manner suited to answer the end: And must be the only
   standard of truth and duty.

   2. Whatever may be justly and clearly inferred as a certain consequence
   from what is expressly revealed in the scriptures, must be considered
   as contained in divine revelation, as really as that which is
   expressed. For instance, if from any two or more truths, expressly
   revealed, another certainty follows, that other truth, by the
   supposition, is really contained in those expressly revealed, and
   therefore is in fact revealed or made known, in the revelation of them.

   3. The holy scriptures are not to be understood without a constant,
   laborious attention to them, and a careful examination and search of
   them, in order to know the mind and will of God therein revealed. This
   is no evidence that the scriptures are not plain and easy to be
   understood; as plain and intelligible, as in the nature of things they
   can be, and adapted, in the best manner, to give instruction in those
   things about which they treat: For they cannot be instructed by the
   best possible means of instruction, who will not attend and take pains.
   They only who "incline their ear unto wisdom, and apply their heart to
   understanding; who cry after knowledge, and lift up their voice for
   understanding; who seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid
   treasures," will understand the sacred writings.

   4. The holy scriptures were never designed to be understood, especially
   in those things that are most important and excellent, by persons of
   corrupt minds, whose hearts have no relish for these things: but do
   wholly oppose and hate them, and are determined in a course of
   disobedience to them. It is impossible indeed, that such should
   understand the sublime holy truths that relate to the infinitely holy
   God, his holy law, gospel and kingdom. Therefore their not being
   understood by such is no argument that they are not sufficiently plain.
   It is no evidence that the sun does not shine clear and bright, because
   they who have no eyes, or if they have, refuse to open them, do not see
   the light, and discern the objects it plainly discovers. It is
   abundantly declared in scripture, that wicked, evil men, will not
   understand the things there revealed. "The wicked know not, neither
   will they understand: They walk on in darkness." [9] "Evil men
   understand not judgment." [10] "The natural man (that is, the man of a
   corrupt, carnal mind) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God;
   for they are foolish unto him: Neither can he know them, because they
   are spiritually discerned." [11] Christ says to the Jews, "How can ye
   believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour
   that cometh from God only!" [12] And again, "If any man will do his
   will, (that is, has an obedient heart ready to comply with the will of
   God, when it is made known to him) he shall know the doctrine, whether
   it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." [13] This implies that
   they who are of a contrary disposition do not understand and know,
   which is expressly asserted in the following words, "Every one that
   doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
   should be reproved. But he that doth truth cometh to the light." [14]
   Therefore, if the scriptures be dark and unintelligible to any,
   especially in the most important matters there revealed, it is not
   owing to any defect or darkness in them; but the fault is wholly in the
   persons themselves, and they are altogether inexcusable and criminal,
   in not seeing what is revealed with sufficient clearness.

   5. It can therefore be easily accounted for, that these sacred writings
   should be so little understood by multitudes, and so greatly
   misunderstood by many; and that there should be so many different and
   opposite opinions respecting the doctrines and duties inculcated in the
   Bible, among those who enjoy this revelation, and profess to make it
   their rule. This is not the least evidence of any defect in the
   scriptures, or that they are not sufficiently plain, and in the best
   manner suited to give instruction; but is wholly owing to the criminal
   blindness, corrupt propensities and unreasonable prejudices of men; who
   do not attend to the Bible with an honest heart. It is impossible that
   a revelation should be given, that cannot be misunderstood, and
   perverted to the worst purposes and to support the greatest errors and
   delusions, by the prejudices, wicked blindness, and perverse
   inclinations of artful men. Nothing has taken place, with respect to
   this, but what might justly be expected, if mankind are naturally as
   depraved and rebellious, as the scriptures represent them to be; and is
   perfectly consistent with the perfection of divine revelation. And when
   men shall in general become honest and virtuous to a proper degree, and
   their hearts shall be turned to the Lord, and to his word, willing and
   ready to receive the dictates of heaven, the vail of darkness and error
   will vanish, and the true light which has so long shined in darkness,
   and so has not been seen and comprehended, shall shine in their hearts,
   and they, receiving the truth in the love of it, will be "perfectly
   joined together, in the same mind and in the same judgment."

   This brings another observation into view.

   6. The chief and greatest end of divine revelation is not yet answered.
   The Bible has been greatly neglected and abused, and not understood;
   and perverted to evil purposes by most of those who have enjoyed it.
   This light has hitherto shined, in a great measure, in vain, in the
   criminal darkness of this world, which has not comprehended, but abused
   and rejected it. And those few who have in some measure understood and
   received and practised the truth, have done it in a very imperfect
   degree; and the Bible has not been yet fully understood by any: But
   this same revelation informs us that it shall not always be so; but the
   time is coming, and is now just at hand, when God will destroy the face
   of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over
   all nations, by causing the gospel to be preached to them all, and
   giving them a heart to discern and understand the truth. Then "the
   light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of
   the sun shall be seven fold, as the light of seven days." And the eyes
   of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear,
   shall hearken. The heart also of the rash or inconsiderate foolish,
   shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be
   ready to speak plainly, and the earth shall be filled with the
   knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." In
   that time the Bible shall be understood, and all the institutions and
   ordinances of the gospel shall have their proper, greatest and most
   happy effect, in the illumination and salvation of multitudes. All that
   precedes this time is but preparatory in order to introduce this day of
   salvation, in the reign of Christ on earth. The word of God shall then
   have free course and be glorified, as it never was before, and shall
   fully answer the end for which it was given. [15]

REFLECTIONS.

   I. WHAT gratitude do we owe to God for giving such a complete
   revelation to men, every way suited to give instruction in every
   necessary and most important truth: and without which mankind must have
   remained in the grossest darkness! What gratitude do we owe to God, who
   has distinguished us from so great a part of mankind, in giving us to
   enjoy this inestimable privilege, while they are left to grope in the
   dark!

   The enemies to divine revelation have made this an objection against
   it, and said, if it were from God, it would have been given equally to
   all mankind, and not confined to so small a part, as this revelation
   has been. Such a partial revelation, say they, which was not completed
   or even began till after many ages and generations were passed and
   gone; and which when it is given is confined to so small a part of
   mankind, cannot be from God, who has no respect of persons, and would
   not conceal what is necessary to be known, from the greatest part of
   men, while a few only are indulged with this favour, if it be one.
   Among other things which might be and have been said in answer to this
   objection, it may be sufficient only to observe the following.

   1. God was under no obligation to enter on those designs of good and
   salvation, and do those things in favour of man, which are now made
   known: And therefore could not be obliged to make this revelation. And
   if he is obliged to none, he may for good reasons, known to him, though
   we should not see them, order things so that but few shall enjoy it, as
   a distinguishing sovereign favour, while others are left in that state
   of darkness, in which all might have justly been left.

   2. It is wholly owing to the fault of man that this revelation has been
   so long, and still is confined to such narrow bounds, and is known to
   so small a part of mankind. The most essential things in this
   revelation were made known to the first parents of mankind. Had they
   been faithful, and all their posterity wise, and disposed to make a
   good improvement of the light, it would have continued and increased,
   and every one of them would have enjoyed it. And after this light was
   abused and rejected, and almost wholly put out, by the wickedness of
   man, before the flood, it was again restored to the new world in the
   family of Noah; and was soon corrupted and extinguished by men, when
   they multiplied into nations, because they loved darkness, and hated
   this light. And when this revelation was renewed and enlarged,
   committed to writing and completed, had mankind been as desirous of
   knowing the truth, and as inquisitive after it, as they ought to have
   been; and had they, who enjoyed it, been as ready and as much engaged
   to understand and practise it, and spread and communicate it to others,
   as was most reasonable, and their duty, all nations would have enjoyed
   it fully, soon after it was published. It is not therefore owing to
   divine revelation that it is so confined, and not universal; but the
   fault is wholly in man. And it is to be wholly ascribed to God's
   merciful, irresistible interposition and care, that it has not been
   wholly lost and destroyed by men, long before this time. Therefore the
   scriptures being preserved as they have been, and handed down to this
   day, and put into our hands by God's merciful, wise, sovereign
   interposition and direction, is both an argument that they are from
   God, and of our great obligations to gratitude to him for this
   unspeakably distinguishing favour.

   3. It may be observed, that they who do not enjoy this revelation, do
   not live up to the light they have, but misimprove and abuse it: And
   therefore have no reason to complain, that they have not greater light
   and advantages; but are most righteously given up to their chosen
   blindness and darkness. There cannot be a person that lives, or ever
   has lived in the heathen world, produced, who has fully improved, and
   lived up to the light he has had, or might have had, were it not his
   own fault. Divine revelation warrants this assertion. "The invisible
   things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
   divinity; so that they are without excuse; because that when they knew
   God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became
   vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."

   Oh! Let us not be unthankful, who enjoy so much greater light, which
   will render our ingratitude proportionably more criminal, and dreadful
   in its consequences. This leads to another reflection.

   II. How very criminal and wretched are they who neglect or abuse this
   inestimable privilege of a revelation from God!--Many not only
   disregard it in practice, but reject and despise it, and speak evil of
   it. How much will the deists, who have been, and now are in the
   christian world, have to answer for! What they call foolishness, is the
   wisdom of God; and the wisdom of which they boast, is the height of
   folly and madness. Would to God there were none who abused and despised
   the holy scriptures, but professed deists! Multitudes, who profess to
   believe the Bible is a revelation from heaven, hold this truth in
   unrighteousness: They pay no proper regard to it, and constantly abuse
   it innumerable ways; and all the advantages they have by it, and
   concerns with it, will only serve to render their damnation greater,
   and unspeakably more dreadful. How much lower will they sink in eternal
   misery, who by their folly and impenitence perish from the countries
   enjoying divine revelation, than they who perish from heathen lands!
   This truth, though so obvious, solemn, and awakening, is too little
   thought of, by those who enjoy, and yet disregard and abuse the holy
   scriptures.

   III. What obligations are we under to attend to this revelation, and
   make the best improvement of it; surely we ought to study it with great
   diligence and care, and meditate therein day and night, looking to God,
   the Father of lights, with sincerity, earnestness and constancy, that
   he would prevent our misunderstanding, and perverting it, and direct
   and lead us to discern all the truths he has revealed, and give us a
   heart to conform to them in practice. We ought to pay a conscientious
   and sacred regard to all the directions and commands in the Bible; to
   turn our feet unto these testimonies, and to improve the words of God,
   as to make it a constant light to our feet, and lamp to our path.
   Blessed are they who thus watch daily at wisdom's gates, and wait at
   the posts of her doors; for they shall be wise unto salvation, obtain
   favour of the Lord, and find eternal life.

   warrant sufficient to condemn and renounce it as such, without being at
   the pains of examining all their pretended miracles, to see if they be
   real miracles or not. If that church could be supported and proved to
   be right, by the holy scriptures, we ought to own it as a true church;

   but even their pretending to work miracles, and appealing to these, is
   a demonstration that it is not a true church, as this is a slight and

CHAP. II.

  CONCERNING THE BEING AND PERFECTIONS OF GOD.

   THOUGH the evidence of the existence of God be as clear and certain as
   that of our own, or of any thing else whatever, and it is one of the
   first dictates of reason, when offered to consideration, and attended
   to; and has by general consent been acknowledged by mankind in all
   ages, as most demonstrable and certain; yet it is most probable that
   even the knowledge, and general acknowledgment of this truth depends
   greatly, if not wholly on divine revelation. Mankind are so "alienated
   from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of
   the blindness of their hearts;" and so disposed by their depravity and
   wickedness to sink down into brutish ignorance and stupidity with
   regard to every thing invisible, that if they were not first told that
   there is a God, they would most probably grow up without believing, or
   ever thinking of this truth. The general acknowledgment of the being of
   God, is no evidence that it does not originate from divine revelation;
   for there are many things generally believed and practised in the
   heathen world, in their religion, which evidently depend on tradition;
   and though in many respects corrupted, had their original in divine
   revelation, handed down from Noah and his sons, or taken from the Jews,
   and the revelation given to them. But one instance shall be mentioned,
   viz. the practice of sacrificing beasts, or some animals, to appease
   the gods, or ingratiate themselves with them, which has so generally
   obtained in the heathen world; and which most certainly never would
   have been thought of by men, had not God first instituted it by
   revelation; and from that it was handed down, and the practice kept up
   among all nations, even long after they had lost, or corrupted, the
   original intent and design of such sacrifices. So the belief of the
   being of a God may derive from the same origin, and be handed down from
   generation to generation the same way. The following facts seem to
   favour this supposition, if they do not clearly prove it.

   1. The absurd and ridiculous notions respecting God, or a plurality of
   gods, which have generally taken place in the heathen world: Such as
   the following, viz. That there are many gods both male and female--that
   they are embodied, like men and women--have carnal affections and
   lusts, and commit adulteries, rapes, &c.--have cruel hatred and
   contentions with one another--are taking advantage of each other by
   deceit and cunning, or by power to accomplish their own selfish,
   unreasonable inclinations and designs, &c. &c. All this can be well
   accounted for; on supposition their belief of the being of God depends
   chiefly on tradition; for this truth, being thus handed down by
   tradition, would naturally and easily be corrupted, and blended with
   endless absurd notions, according to the foolish and wicked humours and
   inclinations of man; which has been the case of all religious truths
   among the heathen, which originated from revelation. But if we suppose
   all nations ill the heathen world believe the existence of God by
   reasoning themselves into it, and attending to the clear and abundant
   evidence there is of this; how can it be accounted for, that they
   should make no use of their reason in forming their notions of Deity
   and determining what kind of a being a God must be; but contrary to all
   the dictates of reason, and the clearest evidence, embrace the greatest
   absurdities? If their belief, in the first instance, be founded on the
   dictates of reason and evidence, why is reason wholly laid aside, in
   the latter; and as soon as they have reasoned themselves into the being
   of a God, make no further use of their reason; but most unreasonably
   believe there are many gods, and embrace the greatest absurdities
   respecting Deity?

   2. Those people and nations who are most out of the reach of the
   instruction and influence of divine revelation, and of the traditions
   which originated from it, have the most faint belief, and make the
   least acknowledgment of the being of a God. And historians and
   travellers tell us that there are people, and even whole nations, among
   whom there is not any acknowledgment of a Deity, or the least
   appearance of the belief of any. [16] These are nations, which by their
   situation and circumstances, are most out of the way of receiving any
   advantage by revelation, and by being long unconnected, and without any
   intercourse with other nations, have by degrees lost all tradition
   relating to every thing invisible. This seems to be a proof that if
   mankind were without all the light and advantages of a revelation, and
   traditions which originate from it, they would not pay any regard to an
   invisible supreme Being, or entertain any belief or notion of such a
   being; but would, in every sense, "live without God in the world." And,
   by the way, this may serve to shew what need mankind stand in, of a
   divine revelation, and that all religious light and knowledge
   originates wholly from this source.

   3. There have been instances of persons who have been deaf from their
   birth, and consequently dumb; and after they have arrived to adult or
   middle age, have been able to hear and speak: And though before this,
   they attended public worship with others, and appeared very devout; and
   often made those signs which those with whom they conversed in this
   way, thought were expressions of their belief of the being of God, and
   of their piety: Yet, when they came to hear and speak, they declared,
   that +hey never had a thought that there was a God, until they could
   hear, and were by that means informed. And there never has been an
   instance known, of any such person's declaring that he had any belief
   or thought of the existence of a God, before he could hear and speak.
   [17]

   Are not these facts an evidence that though the being, of God is so
   clearly manifested in the works of creation and providence, yet
   mankind, in their present fallen, corrupt state, would not discern and
   acknowledge this truth, had it not been otherwise revealed?

   And since the nature of all sin, so far as it has dominion in the
   heart, is real Atheism, and a denial of the God who is above; and
   therefore the fool, the wicked man, always says in his heart, "There is
   no God:" and the tendency of it is to darken and stupify the mind, or
   rather is itself blindness and stupidity, with regard to the being of
   God, and every thing invisible, and naturally shuts all these things
   out of the mind; it can be easily accounted for, that without a
   revelation, the reason of man, who is totally corrupt and sinful, will
   never suggest to him the being of a God, however evident and
   demonstrable this is to reason, when once suggested and revealed, and
   men can be excited and persuaded to attend to the evidence, and
   exercise their reason on the subject.

   We will now take a short and summary view of the evidence there is of
   this great and fundamental truth of all morality and religion; and
   mention some of the arguments which offer themselves to our reason,
   when we attend to the subject. These are not long and intricate; but
   when the truth is once suggested to us, it becomes an object of
   intuition, in a sense, so that though there be reasoning in the case,
   it is so short and easy, that it strikes the mind at once, and it is
   hardly conscious of any reasoning upon it, and of the medium by which
   the evidence comes to the mind. Hence it is probable, that some have
   thought, doubtless without any good reason for it, that the existence
   of God is, what they call an innate idea, which is essential to the
   mind of man, and impressed on it, independent of all reasoning on the
   subject.

   I. It is certain there is a God from our own existence, and the things
   we behold around us. There must be some cause of the existence of these
   things. They could not cause their own existence, or make themselves;
   because this is a contradiction. There must therefore be some invisible
   cause which existed before them, and was able to give them existence,
   and to uphold them when they were made. And this first cause, maker and
   preserver of all things, is God.

   It is natural for the inquisitive mind, when it is necessarily led thus
   far, to inquire, how came God to exist? Or, what is the cause of his
   existence? If he be the first cause, he must be the cause of his own
   existence, which implies a contradiction, or he must exist without any
   cause, and without beginning, which is perfectly inconceivable; and we
   may as well suppose the world exists without a cause, and go no farther
   back for a cause; and then we find no evidence of the existence of God.

   Answer, The first cause of all things we behold, must certainly exist
   without beginning, and so without any cause, that is antecedent to his
   existence, or that is without himself. Yet there may be a reason or
   cause of his existence within himself, viz. The necessity of his
   existence, so that he exists necessarily, there being no other possible
   way or supposition, or it being infinitely impossible it should be
   otherwise; universal non existence, being the greatest contradiction in
   nature.

   If it should be said, this runs all into darkness; for we can no more
   conceive of God's existing necessarily, and without beginning to exist,
   than we can of the world's existing without a cause; and therefore
   gives no relief to the mind: An easy, and it is hoped, a satisfactory
   answer, is at hand. It is a plain contradiction to say, that the world
   and all things in it exist without a cause, or a reason why they exist,
   rather than not: But necessary existence, and existence without
   beginning, implies no contradiction or impossibility. It is granted,
   that each of them is to us incomprehensible; but this is so far from
   being any argument against the truth and reality of them, that it is
   rather an evidence in favour of them; for if there be a God, he must be
   incomprehensible, as he is an infinite being, and exists in a manner
   infinitely above us; therefore must be infinitely above and beyond the
   comprehension of finite minds. It is very unreasonable to object that
   against the being of a God, which certainly must be true if God exists.

   II. The being of God is evident from the manner of our own existence,
   and of all things visible, viz. the design, contrivance and wisdom that
   appear in them. It would fill volumes fully to illustrate this argument
   from the works of creation and providence, as this design and wisdom
   appear in them all; and the more particularly they are considered, the
   more clear the wisdom appears and shines. Volumes have been written on
   the subject, and many more might be written, and yet the subject not be
   exhausted. But it is not consistent with the design of this work, to
   enter particularly into this subject. Every one must have observed so
   much of this, as to see the propriety and force of this argument, at
   first view, unless he be very criminally inattentive. The innumerable
   creatures and things which come under our observation appear to be
   contrived and formed to answer some end; and the numerous ranks of
   different animals are all furnished with provision for their own
   support and defence, and have members and organs suited to their
   situation, and to obtain, receive and use what is necessary for the
   support of their lives, &c. If we attend only to our own bodies, we
   shall find them so admirably contrived, and so curiously formed; and
   though of so many parts, each one is suited to the rest, and all so
   contrived as to form one harmonious system of animal life, without any
   defect or any thing superfluous; is it possible, if we make any proper
   use of our reason, that we should find ourselves inhabiting such
   bodies, without discerning the contrivance and wisdom of our make, and
   seeing and acknowledging the hand and skill of the wise Author of this
   frame, so curious in all its parts and movements? As well may we behold
   a most beautiful, well contrived palace, furnished with every thing
   convenient and comfortable to dwell in, having nothing useless, nothing
   wanting; and not have one thought of a wise skilful architect, who
   contrived and built it; or imagine this building might exist without
   the exertion of any design or wisdom and have no author and maker.

   Surely we cannot survey ourselves and the world in which we are, and
   see the design and contrivance apparently running through the whole,
   and not be convinced that there must be a wise contriver and author who
   has made them. Not to think of and acknowledge this, is to be more like
   beasts, than rational creatures. The language of the Psalmist is most
   rational and natural, when contemplating the works of creation and
   providence. "O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou
   made them all."

   III. The being of God is made evident by the holy scriptures. Not
   merely by being there abundantly asserted; but by the existence of such
   a book as the Bible. It is as much impossible there should be such a
   book, were there no God, as that there should be such a world as we
   see, without an invisible cause. For it is as much beyond the power and
   skill of man, or any number of men, to form such a book, as it is to
   make the world. It is impossible that such a number of men, who lived
   in ages at such a distance from each other, should write so much, and
   not contradict themselves, nor each other; but agree and harmonize in
   every thing, were there no invisible, unerring, omniscient Being to
   direct and guide them: As impossible as it was that every stone and
   piece of timber in Solomon's temple, should come together, and be
   exactly fitted to its place, so as to make one complete, harmonious
   building, without any design, or contrivance; but by mere accident or
   chance. The character of God there given is far above and beside the
   thought of man, and could no more be drawn by man, were there no such
   God, than the world can be made by him. And the law of God there given,
   and at last summed up and comprehended in one sentence, "Thou shalt
   love the Lord with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself," could
   no more be thought of and contrived by man, than the heavens and the
   earth could be planned and produced by him. The series of miracles
   wrought by those who said there was a God, and that Jehovah was the
   only true God; that he spake to them, and they did these wonders in his
   name, and by his power, are a standing proof of the existence of God.

   But above all, the predictions contained in the Bible, with their exact
   and certain accomplishment, is a striking proof and demonstration of
   the existence of an omniscient, omnipotent Being. For it is as much
   beyond the art and power of men to foretel so many thousand events, so
   precisely answering the prediction, as it is for him to make the sun,
   moon and stars.

   All these have been urged as proofs of the divinity of the scriptures,
   and they are equal proofs of the being of God. Therefore, though
   invisible things of God are clearly seen in the works of creation and
   providence, even his eternal power and godhead; so that all the nations
   who have not the Bible are left without excuse, which if they do not
   believe in, love and worship the true God: yet they who enjoy this book
   have more clear evidence of the being of God, as well as unspeakably
   greater advantages to know his true character; and consequently are far
   more inexcusable than the heathen, if they do not believe.

   Upon the evidence of the existence of God, two things may be observed.

   1. Though this be as evident a truth as any whatsoever, and men may
   have a full rational conviction of it, while their hearts are opposite
   to it, and receive no impressions answerable to this truth, and the
   whole system of their affections and exercises of heart, are just as if
   this were not true, or directly contrary to it; yet do really say in
   their hearts, there is no God. Therefore we find this asserted in the
   scriptures, "The fool, (that is, the wicked man whose heart is wholly
   corrupt, as it is there explained) says in his heart there is no God."
   Hence it is, that this conviction and profession, that there is a God,
   in multitudes of instances, has little or no effect on the heart and
   practice; but while they profess to know there is a God, in their
   hearts and in their works they deny him. In this case, the heart
   governs the man, and forms his true moral character, and not his
   speculative conviction and judgment, which is so weak and ineffectual
   that it flies, or vanishes, into nothing, before the strong fixed
   propensities of the ungodly heart, as a bubble is blown away by the
   strong blast of a furious wind.

   2. Where the heart is upright and honest, and men have a proper taste
   and relish for moral truth, the evidence of the being of God is
   discerned in a true light. The being and true character of God appear
   to be a pleasing reality; they have a genuine and powerful impression
   on the heart, and its leading affections and exercises are answerable
   to the truth. Therefore the scriptures represent such only, as knowing
   God and believing in him; and others are spoken of as not knowing God,
   and saying in their hearts there is no God, and in their works denying
   him. The latter are in darkness, and walk in darkness which blindeth
   their eyes. The god of this world hath blinded their minds, so that
   they believe not, and the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who
   is the image of God, doth not shine unto them. But the light shines
   into the hearts of the former, and gives them the light of the
   knowledge of the glory of God, ill the face of Jesus Christ. For where
   the being of God is truly discerned, his whole revealed character, or
   his glory, is in some good measure seen; and they who have not
   discerning and relish of this glory, which is true of all wicked men,
   have not that belief of the being of God which good men have, as their
   faith consists in mere speculation; which is not the true light. This
   is so plain, that a heathen has said, "The mind destitute of virtue,
   cannot see the beauty of truth." [18]

   This leads us to consider the character and perfections of God; or what
   God is. This is the must important subject in the whole compass of
   divinity, as right conceptions of God lay the best and only foundation
   for religious knowledge and right sentiments in general: And it is no
   doubt true, that all who agree in their sentiments respecting the
   divine character, will also agree in the same system of religious
   truth: And the origin of the difference and opposition of opinion that
   have taken place among professing christians, respecting the doctrines
   of Christianity, is their different and opposite notions of the
   character and perfections of God. Therefore the true knowledge of God
   is often mentioned in scripture as the sum of all knowledge, and
   comprehending all religious knowledge. This affords a good reason for
   our attending to this awful subject with great care and caution; with
   solemnity of mind, reverence and devotion, searching the holy
   scriptures, and praying that we may be saved from wrong and
   dishonourable conceptions of God; and obtain the true knowledge of him.

   What are called the natural perfections of God, as distinguished from
   his moral perfections, are first to be considered. There is a general
   agreement respecting these, among those who enjoy divine revelation, as
   men are not so prone to prejudice and error on this head, as they are
   concerning the other. It will therefore be needless to enlarge here.

   We are warranted by the scriptures, and it appears reasonable, to
   exclude every thing that implies any imperfection, when we consider
   what God is; and ascribe to him nothing that is not absolutely perfect
   in the highest degree. Therefore we must conceive God to be a pure
   spirit, which the scriptures assert: And hence we are certain that
   nothing corporeal, or that has any shape, figure or limits, is to be
   ascribed to him. Hence it is unreasonable and very dishonourable to
   God, to attempt to make any image or likeness of him, by any thing that
   has figure or shape, or to form or entertain any such notion in our
   minds. Moses gave a particular caution on this head to the people of
   Israel. "The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
   the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice.
   Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves, lest ye corrupt
   yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure;
   for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto
   you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire." And this is expressly
   prohibited in the second command, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any
   graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or
   that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."
   Therefore when God is spoken of in the scriptures as if he had bodily
   parts and members, hands, eyes, cars, mouth, &c.--these expressions are
   to be taken in a figurative sense, and mean no more than that God does
   see and hear, &c. which we perform by those members and organs; and not
   that he has eyes of flesh, or sees as man does: Such language being
   used as better suited to convey knowledge to our minds, in conformity
   to man's way of speaking and conceiving.

   In the scriptures God is represented as an infinite being, that he is,
   in every respect, without limits or bounds. His existence is infinite,
   or in him is an infinite degree of existence, so that all created
   existence is nothing when compared with him; and indeed is comprehended
   in him, and is really no addition to existence, it being only an
   emanation from him, the fountain and sum of all existence. And all his
   attributes and perfections are infinite, according to the scriptures.
   "His understanding is infinite," and consequently every thing that can
   be attributed to him.

   And reason teaches that God must be infinite. He who exists without any
   cause, that is, without himself, or who exists of and from himself,
   from the necessity of his own nature; or, in other words, exists
   necessarily, must be infinite or cannot have any bounds or limits, in
   any respect; and that for these two plain reasons,

   L He can be limited or bounded by no thing, because there can be
   nothing to limit him; no possible cause or reason of any kind of
   limitation; and therefore there can be none.

   2. Necessary existence must be infinite; for as there can be nothing to
   bound this necessity, it must take place with respect to every possible
   degree of existence, and is as much a reason of infinite existence, as
   of any existence at all. If any existence be necessary, infinite
   existence is necessary; so that it is a plain contradiction to suppose
   that God exists of himself, or necessarily; and yet has but a limited
   degree of existence, or is not infinite.

   Hence it appears that God exists without beginning, or end; or is
   eternal, as he is represented in the scriptures: For he who has no
   limits, but is infinite, can have neither beginning or end, or must be
   infinite in duration. And necessary existence must be eternal, because
   this same necessity cannot be limited as to time or duration; but is
   always the same. It is a contradiction to say that self existence, or
   which is the same, necessary existence, does not exist, or can cease to
   exist.

   For the same reason God is unchangeable in all respects; which the holy
   scriptures abundantly assert. He who exists necessarily, and is
   infinite, must exist unchangeably in the most perfect manner and
   degree. Change, or alteration in any respect, necessarily supposes
   limitation and imperfection. And as God is eternal and immutable, he
   must be without any succession; for this supposes change, and an
   advance in years and increase of duration. God does not grow older;
   there is nothing first or last, no beginning or end, past or to come,
   with respect to him; he has no change or succession of ideas; but he
   inhabits or possesses eternity, without the least variation or shadow
   of turning.

   God is perfect and infinite in understanding and knowledge. He is
   omnipresent, which is necessarily implied in his infinite, unlimited
   existence.

   God is almighty. He can do what he pleases, and nothing is impossible
   with him. And he must be absolutely and infinitely independent and all
   sufficient. All this is asserted in the scriptures, and it is easy to
   see they are essential to the character of God, who made and governs
   the world, and is to be trusted in all cases, and worshipped.

   God is invisible. Invisibility is ascribed to him in the scriptures, as
   essential and peculiar to him: And the meaning is not merely, that he
   is invisible as all pure spirits are, not to be seen by our bodily
   eyes; but he is not to be seen by any created mind, by direct,
   immediate intuition; nor can he ever be seen thus to all eternity; but
   only as he reveals and manifests himself, ad extra, by his works, or
   some other medium, or exhibition. This seems to be asserted in the
   following words, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten
   Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." It is
   to be observed, that the word man, is not in the original; but it is
   none, or no one hath seen God; and the assertion may be considered as
   extending to angels as well as men. St. Paul says, No man hath seen,
   nor can see God.

   God is incomprehensible, by all finite minds. This is as evident and
   certain, as it is that what is finite cannot reach unto and comprehend
   infinity. But a little portion can be known of God, compared with the
   whole of his existence: And none, among men or angels, can by searching
   find out God to perfection; though under the best possible advantages,
   and possessed of the greatest abilities to search; and though they
   exert all their powers and strength to the utmost, and wisely improve
   every advantage to get knowledge, without intermission, and without
   end. Though they should make the swiftest progress imaginable in the
   knowledge of God, they would still fall infinitely short of fully
   comprehending all that is in God, or even any one thing. For however
   great and extensive this knowledge may be, in itself considered; yet it
   is but finite, and therefore is infinitely less than the perfect,
   adequate knowledge of an infinite being. Creatures may have the true
   knowledge of God; they may know something of him, and what they know
   may be agreeable to the truth; but this is infinitely short of
   comprehending his being, or any of his attributes and perfections. This
   plain truth may well be improved to teach us modesty in our inquiries
   about God; and shew us the arrogancy and folly of those who refuse to
   believe any thing respecting the existence, character or works of God,
   which cannot be comprehended. Such, while they are valuing themselves,
   for their own reasoning abilities, are acting a most unreasonable part.
   How unreasonable are they who doubt of the being or any of the
   perfections of God, only because they cannot fully understand and
   comprehend how they can be. For if there be a God clothed with infinite
   perfection, he must be incomprehensible. They who will not believe in a
   God whose being and manner of existence are beyond their comprehension,
   must certainly have no true God; for what they reject, is essential to
   the true God; and were there nothing incomprehensible, it is certain
   there could be no God.

   The moral perfections of God are next to be considered; or what the
   scriptures say of his moral character. As this is of the greatest
   importance to be known, we may be sure it is very clearly discovered,
   and precisely stated in divine revelation, whatever mistakes men may
   make about it, and however they may differ in their sentiments
   concerning those divine attributes. We have therefore the greatest
   reason and encouragement to search the scriptures with attention and
   care, and upright and honest hearts, that we may find the knowledge of
   God, in this part of his character.

   The following general observations may be made concerning the moral
   perfections of God, before they are considered more particularly.

   1. The infinite excellence, beauty and glory of God, consist wholly in
   his moral perfections and character. Infinite greatness, understanding
   and power, without any rectitude, wisdom and goodness of heart, if this
   were possible, would not be desirable and amiable; but worse than
   nothing, and infinitely dreadful. Therefore they who do not understand
   the true moral character of God, and discern the excellence and glory
   of it, have not the knowledge of God; his real amiableness and glory
   are hid from them. And this being true of all whose moral character is
   wholly evil, and who have hearts altogether opposed to the moral
   perfections of God, they are represented in the scriptures as not
   knowing God. "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
   commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." [19] "He that
   loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love." [20]

   2. The moral character and perfection of God consists in his holiness.
   Holiness comprehends all that belongs to his moral character, and does
   not consist in any particular attribute, distinct from any other moral
   perfection. The holiness of God is his goodness, wisdom, justice, truth
   and faithfulness, &:c. It consists in these, and cannot be
   distinguished from them. Therefore they who have considered holiness as
   a distinct attribute of God, and have attempted to describe it as
   distinguished from goodness, wisdom, Sec. do not appear to have any
   distinct, clear ideas, and to be able to give any satisfactory or
   intelligible definition of it. It does not appear that the scriptures
   warrant any such distinction; but there the holiness of God means the
   goodness of his moral character in general. And we find that when it is
   applied to men, it denotes a virtuous moral character and conduct, and
   comprehends every thing morally good, even every branch of moral
   excellence. And should any one attempt to define the holiness of a man,
   as distinct from goodness, his love to God and his neighbour, his
   humility, righteousness and temperance, he not only would have no
   scripture warrant for it; but must run himself into the dark, and be
   altogether unintelligible to himself and others.

   3. The whole of true holiness, or the moral excellence and perfection
   of God, is comprehended in love, or goodness, by whatever names it may
   be called. Where there is no love or goodness of heart, there is
   nothing morally good; and where this love or goodness is, there is
   every moral virtue and excellence, as necessarily involved and implied
   in it. Therefore infinite goodness is infinite moral perfection, and
   forms an absolutely perfect and infinitely excellent moral character.
   By this love and goodness is meant good will, with every affection
   necessarily implied in it; that universal benevolence which consists in
   a disposition to seek and promote the greatest possible general good
   and happiness, and all those affections and exercises, and that conduct
   in which this is expressed and acted out. What absolutely perfect and
   infinite benevolence and goodness implies, and contains in the nature
   of it; and that nothing can be added to it to form an infinitely
   excellent moral character, will be more particularly considered and
   evinced hereafter. But it is proper first to consider what evidence we
   have from the scriptures, that the divine, moral character, or the
   holiness of God, consists wholly in this.

   1. The holy law of God, which is not only the standard of holiness, or
   of moral excellence and perfection in the creature, but an expression
   and transcript of divine holiness, requires nothing but love or
   goodness; so that he who loveth, as the law of God requires, is
   perfectly conformed to the law, which is the same with being perfectly
   holy: And this is perfect conformity or likeness to God in his moral
   character; for holiness in the creature is the moral image of God:
   Therefore God. says to men, "Be ye holy; for I am holy."

   Jesus Christ has taught us that the holy law of God requires nothing
   but love, in the following remarkable words, "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like
   unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two
   commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Agreeable to this St.
   Paul says, "Love is the fulfilling of the law." Nothing can be more
   expressly asserted than this, viz. that love, exercised to a proper
   degree, and expressed and acted out in all proper ways, forms a perfect
   moral character; and therefore that the divine moral character consists
   wholly in this.

   2. The apostle John says repeatedly that God is love, and he that
   dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Here all the moral
   perfections of God are comprehended in love, and by this the whole of
   his moral character is expressed. If we know what love is, we know what
   God is; for God is love. And if we dwell in love, we are conformed to
   God, and he dwelleth in us, his moral image is formed in us by love.

   3. When Moses besought God to shew him his glory; in answer to this
   petition, God said, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee." And
   when he granted this petition, it is said, "The Lord descended in the
   cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord.
   And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord
   God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness
   and truth." The glory of God consists in his moral perfection and
   character: But when he proposes to shew this his glory to Moses, he
   mentions his goodness, and nothing else, "I will make all my goodness
   to pass before thee." q.d. I have no glory to show but my goodness;
   this is the whole of my moral beauty and excellence. And when it is
   said, "he proclaimed the name of the Lord;" it means that he proclaimed
   his character, and declared that in which his moral perfection and
   glory did consist. And here is nothing but goodness or love mentioned.
   Love in the highest, most resplendent and glorious exercises and
   manifestations of it, in the pardon and salvation of sinners. Truth is
   indeed mentioned here; but not as any thing distinct from goodness or
   benevolence; but as that which is necessarily included in it. But this
   leads to a more particular consideration of the moral perfections of
   God, which are included in love or goodness.

   1. Infinite wisdom is a moral perfection of God. Wisdom consists in
   discerning, and proposing the highest and best end, and fixing on, and
   pursuing the most proper and best way and means, in order to accomplish
   it. Infinite wisdom does this with infinite ease, and without any
   possibility of the least error and mistake. It is certain that this
   wisdom is a moral excellence, and belongs to the heart, and therefore
   does not consist in mere speculation, or that knowledge or
   understanding, which may be without any rectitude or goodness of
   disposition or heart. Satan, who has no moral goodness, has no wisdom.
   He does not discern and propose any good end, but the contrary; and is
   devising and pursuing methods to accomplish his evil designs.
   Therefore, however clear and right his speculations may be in some
   instances, and though he may be very subtil and cunning, he has no
   wisdom, and no true discerning in things of a moral nature; but all his
   proposals, designs and pursuits, are directly the reverse of wisdom.
   They are consummate folly and madness. Therefore the scriptures speak
   of wisdom, as a moral excellence; yea, as including all moral
   rectitude; and perfectly opposed to all folly or moral evil; and a wise
   and understanding heart, in the scriptures, means a moral excellence
   depending on the disposition of the heart, and not consisting in any
   knowledge and speculations which are consistent with a corrupt and evil
   heart. Of this every one who has attended to the Bible, must be
   sensible; it is therefore needless to produce passages here to prove
   it. This true wisdom is called light, in the scriptures; in which sense
   God is said to be light, and to dwell in light. "God is light, and in
   him is no darkness at all."

   Wisdom and goodness, or benevolence, are not to be considered as
   distinct, and the former as independent of the latter. Where there is
   no benevolence there is no wisdom; for where benevolence or goodness is
   not, there no good end is proposed and pursued, or discerned. It is
   benevolence alone that seeks the highest general good, and proposes and
   pursues the best end; and where this is not, the true good is not
   discerned, and therefore the best end is not proposed, sought, or
   perceived. This therefore gives or contains all the light and
   discerning there is in true wisdom. If we have a just idea of
   benevolence or goodness of heart, and know what that is, we have an
   idea of true wisdom, the latter being necessarily included in the
   former. This will be evident to every one who considers and understands
   what benevolence is, and what is true wisdom; so that no farther proof
   of this point will be needed. This is agreeable to what is said in the
   scriptures of benevolence and wisdom. There love or benevolence is
   represented as being or containing all that light and knowledge which
   is in true wisdom; and that where this love is not, there is not any
   degree of this light and discerning. "Every one that loveth, knoweth
   God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God. He that saith he is in the
   light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that
   loveth his brother, abideth in the light: But he that hateth his
   brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness." Here love is said to
   be, or imply, all that light and discerning which is of a moral nature,
   in which true wisdom consists; therefore love is wisdom. Love is true
   light and discerning, and this is true wisdom. Love is the true
   knowledge of God, or implies it, and is essential to it. And in the
   knowledge of God true wisdom consists. "If thou incline thine ear unto
   wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding--thou shalt then
   understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God: For the
   Lord giveth wisdom." [21]

   Moreover, the scriptures teach us that wisdom, considered as proposing
   and pursuing a good end by the best means, consists in love. There it
   is said, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of
   the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: But fools despise wisdom and
   instruction." And unto man he said, "The fear of the Lord, that is
   wisdom, and to depart from evil, is understanding." By the fear of the
   Lord, is evidently meant, true piety, or obedience to God, in keeping
   his commandments; which consists wholly in love, love to God and our
   neighbour. This, it is said, is true wisdom, and is the beginning of
   wisdom. There is no wisdom where there is no love to God, and wisdom
   begins in this, and this is wisdom itself. Therefore, according to the
   scriptures, love is wisdom and understanding. Agreeable to this, all
   true virtue and moral rectitude, which consists in love, is called
   wisdom, in the Proverbs of Solomon, and through the Bible; and the
   contrary is called folly: And the former is called understanding and
   knowledge, the latter darkness and ignorance.

   Hence it appears, not only that wisdom is moral rectitude and
   excellence, and a moral perfection of God; but also that it is nothing
   more than benevolence or goodness, and is included in it; so that when
   it is said God is love, his wisdom is asserted, as well as his
   goodness; because love or goodness, is wisdom itself.

   2. Justice or righteousness belongs to the moral character of God. This
   denotes in general the perfect and infinite rectitude of his will, in
   opposition to all injustice or unrighteousness. The scriptures
   constantly ascribe this to God, as essential to the perfection and
   glory of his character, as every one must be sensible who is acquainted
   with the Bible. "He is the rock, his work is perfect: For all his ways
   are judgment: A God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is
   he." "The Lord is righteous in all his ways."

   Righteousness often has a very extensive meaning in the scriptures, and
   seems frequently to be used to express the whole of the moral character
   and glory of God, or his moral rectitude in general; as it is also
   often used to express the moral character of a man who is conformed to
   God, or true holiness. "Put on the new man, which after God is created
   in righteousness and true holiness." Here righteousness and true
   holiness seem to mean the same thing, and the latter, true holiness, is
   put as exegetical of the former; because righteousness, expresses the
   whole of moral rectitude, both in God and the creature. "Blessed are
   they who hunger and thirst after righteousness," that is, true
   holiness. But the instances of righteousness being used in the
   scriptures in this extensive sense, as including all moral goodness,
   are too many to be particularly mentioned here. Every one who has read
   the Bible knows that the words just and righteous are commonly used to
   denote that moral character, rectitude and holiness, by which good or
   holy men are distinguished from others. To be righteous, is to be right
   according to the rule, the holy law of God, the standard of all moral
   rectitude; and therefore must include universal holiness.

   But righteousness and justice are sometimes used in the scriptures in a
   more limited sense, both when applied to God and to men; and to be just
   or righteous, is to be disposed to do no wrong to any, and actually to
   do none; but to give to every one, every thing to which he has a right,
   and may justly claim as his due, and is therefore opposed to doing
   wrong or injuring any being, by withholding or taking from him that to
   which he hath a right, which is called injustice, or unrighteousness.
   Justice and righteousness of a judge, and when ascribed to God, as such
   also denote, judging according to truth between opposing and contending
   parties, justifying the innocent and injured, espousing, vindicating
   and maintaining his cause; and condemning and punishing the guilty and
   injurious, according to his desert; especially when this is necessary
   to vindicate the character and cause of the injured in the best manner,
   and to make proper restitution for the injury done. Not to do this
   would be to pervert justice and judgment.

   This justice, righteousness or uprightness, is essential to a perfect
   moral character, and therefore must be included in infinite moral
   perfection. It is needless to him, who reads the Bible with attention,
   to say that justice, in this sense, is there constantly ascribed to
   God; and that he who overlooks this, or has wrong notions of it, must
   be ignorant of the moral character of God.

   It is important to observe here, that God, in the exercise of justice,
   or righteousness, has a proper regard to himself, and is disposed to
   maintain the rights of Deity, and properly to resent all injuries done
   to him. Therefore he requires his rational creatures to love him with
   all their hearts, because this is his due; and has annexed to his law a
   threatening of a punishment, which is the just desert of the
   transgression of it, or of any injury done to him. This regard to
   himself, and disposition to assert and maintain his rights and
   character, is expressed, when he styles himself a jealous God, who is
   jealous for his holy name; [22] and will not give his glory to another,
   neither his praise to graven images: [23] "For my name's sake will I
   defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut
   thee not off. For mine own sake, even for mine own sake will I do it;
   for how should my name be polluted? And I will not give my glory to
   another." [24] "God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, the Lord will
   take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his
   enemies." [25]

   It belongs to God to vindicate his own rights, his name and character,
   and see that justice is done to himself; for there is no other being
   who can have the care of this, or can do it, or see that it is done.
   But he who is most upright, infinitely righteous, and can do no wrong,
   and sees what is right in all cases, without any possibility of
   mistake, is every way qualified to judge, decide and act in this
   matter, and it becomes him to do it; and not to regard his own rights,
   and do justice to himself, would be infinitely unjust and wrong. As God
   is infinitely the greatest, and the sum and perfection of all being,
   and his character, interest and rights, are of infinitely the greatest
   worth and importance; to disregard his rights, and injure him, is
   infinitely the highest instance of injustice that can be; and the
   exercise of justice and righteousness, in the first place, and chiefly,
   respects him; and were it possible for God to disregard his own
   character, and not vindicate and maintain his own rights, he would be
   infinitely far from being just and righteous; and this would be a
   greater instance of injustice, than every possible injury to all
   creatures, can be. Therefore when God is said to be just, it
   necessarily includes his being just to himself, so that he w ill do
   himself no wrong, but will regard and maintain his own rights, and
   claim and secure the honour due to his name: and if he be injured by
   any, he will see that complete restitution is made, whatever it may
   cost him who does the injury. And at the same time he is infinitely
   engaged to administer justice through all his dominions, and not to
   injure any one of his creatures in the least degree. "The Judge of all
   the earth will do right."

   Before we leave this head, it must be particularly observed, that
   justice or righteousness, whether taken in a more extensive, or in a
   confined sense, is nothing really distinct from love or goodness; but
   is included in it, and essential to it, though it has been thus
   distinctly considered. For injustice is directly opposed to good will;
   and goodness will not injure any one. He therefore, who is perfectly
   good, must be perfectly just; and goodness always is, and always will
   be justice. And infinite benevolence or love disposes to maintain and
   vindicate the rights of all; to administer justice and judgment in all
   cases; to condemn and punish the injurious so far as is necessary to
   make compensation to the injured. For as universal goodness seeks the
   greatest general good, it can do no wrong; and is therefore opposed to
   all ill will, and every thing that is contrary to the rights of any
   being, and to the highest general good. Love, therefore, still appears
   to comprehend all moral rectitude and excellence; and justice or
   righteousness in the divine Being, is nothing but universal, infinite
   benevolence, considered with relation to particular objects, and as
   acted out in particular circumstances.

   3. Perfect truth and faithfulness are essential to the moral character
   of God, and included in his holiness. His declarations are all
   perfectly agreeable to the truth: and none can be deceived by believing
   what he says. Whatever he promises may be relied upon with the greatest
   safety; and all his predictions, promises and threatenings he
   punctually and completely accomplishes.

   And here again, it must be observed, that truth and faithfulness are
   not to be distinguished from goodness, as though there were any thing
   in them different from it, and not contained in it, and essential to
   it; for there is no foundation for this, and it would be contrary to
   the truth. He who is infinitely benevolent must be perfect and
   unchangeable in truth and faithfulness; for love or goodness is itself
   truth and faithfulness, acted out in that particular manner, and
   towards those particular objects in which it obtains this denomination.
   There can be no truth and fidelity, where there is no goodness; and
   where the latter is, there, in the same degree, is the former.

   We have new had some view of the moral character of God, or his
   holiness; and find it to consist in love or goodness, wisdom,
   righteousness or justice, truth and faithfulness. And that all is
   comprehended in love or benevolence, there being not only nothing
   contrary to this; but nothing really distinct from it, and that is not
   essential to it: The whole being nothing but infinite goodness, in
   different views of it, and as it respects different objects; and on
   this account, and that we may better understand it, the scriptures
   speak of it by parts, and call the parts of this whole, by different
   names.

   But this very important and interesting subject requires yet further
   consideration; and it is hoped the following observations will not be
   useless; but tend to cast more light upon it.

   I. When it is said that the moral character of God, or his holiness,
   consists in love, in which sense "God is love," universal, infinite
   benevolence or good will is meant by love, and all that which this
   necessarily implies. This has been supposed, and taken for granted, in
   all that has been already said on this subject; but needs to be more
   particularly explained, and made evident. When God is said to be love,
   it is evident that the love of benevolence, or the goodness of God, is
   here meant from the context, where the meaning of the apostle is
   explained. When it is said, "God is love," the words immediately
   following are these, "In this was manifested the love of God towards
   us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that
   we might live through him. Herein is love: Not that we loved God, but
   that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
   sins." Here the love of benevolence or good will only, is mentioned as
   that in which the love of God was manifested and acted out: Therefore
   this is the love here intended, when it is said, "God is love." It is
   love of good will to enemies, to men in a state of rebellion against
   God; and therefore the most disinterested, generous love and goodness.
   This is the love and goodness spoken of by Christ, when he says, "God
   so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." This is
   by the angels, called good will to men. This is the highest instance of
   the most pure disinterested benevolence or goodness; in which God has
   made the clearest discovery of his infinite goodness, and so of all his
   moral perfections, that creatures have ever beheld. This benevolence
   has the highest good of being in general for its object: Being capable
   of life and happiness. It discerns what is the supreme, greatest good,
   and this it seeks and pursues with unerring wisdom; and being attended
   with omnipotence, all the infinite good, the proper object of infinite
   benevolence, which is discerned, willed and sought, must take place in
   the highest possible degree, without the least defect. This is
   universal benevolence; disinterested, unlimited, infinite goodness,
   which has the highest possible good of being in general for its object,
   that is, infinite good; which must infallibly take place, and be
   enjoyed forever.

   II. This love of benevolence does not exclude, but necessarily
   includes, that which is called love of complacence; for he who is good,
   benevolent and friendly, must delight in goodness. He will not only
   take pleasure in the exercise of goodness; but will be pleased with
   benevolence wherever it exists. Therefore a complacency and delight in
   holiness, or moral excellence, is always implied in holiness. God is
   therefore represented in the scriptures as delighting and taking
   pleasure in the upright, in them that fear him, and are truly holy, and
   delighting in the exercise of loving kindness, judgment and
   righteousness. But it ought to be remembered that love of complacency
   is not the primary or chief part of holy love; for holiness must exist
   as the object of complacency, in order to the existence of the latter.
   And what can this holiness be, which is the object ox complacency and
   the spring of holy delight, but the love of benevolence or goodness?
   This is the primary and most essential part; yea, the sum of holy love,
   which implies the love of complacency in its nature; the latter being a
   branch and emanation from the former. Therefore when we think and speak
   of holy love, benevolence should be the primary and chief idea in our
   minds, as being the sum of all, and implying the whole: For holy
   complacency, is complacency in benevolence and a benevolent
   complacency. And if we leave benevolence out of our idea of the love of
   complacency, we have no idea of true holiness; nor understand the
   scriptures where they speak of holy love in God or creatures.

   It is true indeed, that moral excellence, or the love of benevolence
   and complacency, may be the object of benevolence as well as
   complacency, for the more excellent any being is. the greater is his
   importance and worth, and his interest so much more valuable; and
   indeed, the more existence he has; for excellence is real existence:
   Therefore there will not only be more complacence and delight in such a
   being; but he is more the object of benevolence, in wishing him well,
   prosperous and happy, and doing him good if he stands in need, and
   there is opportunity; and in being friendly to his existence,
   prosperity and happiness, and rejoicing in the same. But this is not
   the primary object of benevolence, but what may be called the secondary
   object, which appears from what has been said; for benevolence is good
   will to being, and seeks the greatest good of the whole; and therefore
   loves those who have no excellence, and wishes well even to enemies;
   but is exercised in a stronger degree, and a peculiar manner, towards
   those beings who are themselves benevolent, and friends to the general
   good; while at the same time they are the only objects of complacence
   and delight.

   III. Divine love or goodness is perfectly disinterested, in opposition
   to all self love, or selfishness. This is expressed by uprightness, or
   righteousness, and consists in it. Uprightness is ascribed to God in
   the scriptures, as essential to his character; yea, he is called "the
   most upright." [26] That is, perfectly, infinitely, and unchangeably
   so. This is opposed to partiality, which consists in self love, and is
   selfishness itself. True goodness, or love, is in its own nature
   uprightness, or disinterested, in opposition to this self love, which
   is in its nature partiality and unrighteousness, and contains in it the
   essence and sum of all that which is opposed to true holiness, that is,
   all sin. Therefore we must exclude from the love in which the divine
   holiness consists, all that can be properly called self-love, all
   selfish, partial, interested affection; and consider the holiness of
   God as infinitely opposed to all this.

   IV. God himself is the object of his own love and goodness. Or, in the
   exercise of his love he has respect and regard to Deity as well as to
   creatures. This is necessarily implied in perfect, universal, infinite
   benevolence, which includes impartial uprightness and righteousness;
   for it would be infinitely otherwise, and the most partial, unrighteous
   affection, if there were no regard paid to the infinite fountain and
   sum of all being and perfection. That which is friendly to the greatest
   universal good of existence, and is most pleased and delighted with the
   highest moral perfection, must regard the interest of the supreme Head
   of the universe, and delight in the most perfect beauty and excellence.
   And it hence follows that God is the chief and supreme object of his
   own love and regard; and he loves and regards himself infinitely more
   than the whole creation, and makes himself his highest and last end of
   all: and therefore has made all things for himself, as the scriptures
   assert. This has nothing of the nature of what is called self-love in
   creatures; but is directly and perfectly opposed to it. There is not
   the least partiality and selfishness in it; but the contrary, and is
   uprightness and righteousness itself, as has been shown; for if God did
   not love and regard himself, his rights and interest, according to his
   own existence, importance and excellence, he would not be just,
   impartial and upright. Impartial, disinterested benevolence and
   affection must pay the greatest regard to the greatest and best being;
   and therefore to suppose this is partiality and selfishness is most
   unreasonable, and a direct contradiction.

   This evident truth, which may be so easily demonstrated, ought to be
   impressed on our minds, and never forgotten; for if it be out of view,
   and wholly disregarded, we cannot have right conceptions of God, or
   understand the holy scriptures: and must be in darkness with respect to
   the most important doctrines of Christianity, and not know wherein true
   religion consists. Many, by making a mistake here, and considering the
   love of God as having no respect to himself, but wholly exercised
   towards his creatures, in seeking their good and happiness only, have
   conceived of him as an almighty tool or servant, existing only for the
   sake of his creatures, and seeking nothing but their happiness; and
   hence have gone into a scheme of doctrines and religion, which is
   wholly selfish, and as contrary to the holy scriptures, as darkness is
   to light.

   Let it then be fixed and remembered, that God is love. He is infinite
   benevolence and goodness itself; and that he himself is the first,
   chief and last object of this love; so that he regards himself
   supremely and ultimately in all his works, and does every thing for
   himself, for his own sake: And that his wisdom and righteousness
   consist chiefly in this, as he would be neither just, faithful, nor
   wise, should he forget himself, and have no regard to his own rights
   and character, in any one thing that he does through all his dominions;
   and therefore to suppose he does, is to entertain the most
   dishonourable thought of him, which in the highest degree tarnishes and
   ruins his moral character. In the light of this truth, rightly
   understood, and cordially embraced, we shall have great assistance in
   finding the meaning of the holy scriptures; and determining what are
   the important doctrines there revealed, and see their consistence and
   beauty.

   V. Infinite benevolence or goodness, which seeks and promotes the
   greatest good of the whole, is infinitely opposed to all malevolence or
   ill will, which opposes all the good of being, and tends to universal
   evil; and must be infinitely displeased with it. This is just as
   evident and certain, as it is that he who loves and is friendly to any
   particular character, or desirable object, is displeased with the
   contrary, and hates it, to as great a degree as he loves and is pleased
   with the other. And this displeasure and hatred is implied in his love
   to the opposite object and pleasure in it; and is really the same
   affection acting towards opposite objects.

   He who is a friend to the greatest good, and therefore is pleased with
   such friendship, must be equally an enemy to ail who oppose this good,
   and proportionally displeased and angry with them. And this
   displeasure, hatred and anger, in a perfectly benevolent being, is
   nothing in nature different from benevolence. It is nothing but
   goodness opposing its contrary; which it must do, or else cease to be
   love and goodness.

   Agreeable to this, the scriptures represent God, who is infinite love
   and goodness, to be in a proportionable degree displeased with all sin,
   which is in its nature opposition to benevolence, and to the general
   good. This is represented as the object of his implacable hatred; and
   as exciting his anger, indignation, wrath and fury. This is so far from
   leading us to conceive of any thing in God contrary to infinite love
   and goodness, or really distinct from it, that it is nothing more than
   benevolence acting according to its own nature towards objects that
   oppose it. For love of good is itself opposition to evil, and hatred of
   it, and benevolence must be displeased with ill will, and hate and
   oppose the same. Nor are these opposite or different affections; but
   the same affection, love, acting towards different objects.

   This displeasure, anger and wrath of God against sin, and the sinner,
   may therefore with propriety be called a just, benevolent, kind
   displeasure; which is the same with holy displeasure; all proceeding
   from love, and implied in it. Therefore, when we read in the scriptures
   of the divine displeasure, anger, wrath, &c. we must not form the same
   idea of this, as we do of those passions, as they exist in man; for
   this would be to conceive of God as exercising affections and passions,
   contrary to love; and as very imperfect, changeable and miserable. We
   must exclude, in our minds, every thing that implies imperfection or
   change, and that is inconsistent with infinite benevolence and
   felicity; and understand those expressions in the scriptures, as
   meaning perfect, unchangeable opposition of God to everything in moral
   agents that is contrary to infinite benevolence or goodness; for which
   they are wholly blameable and answerable, and deserve to be punished.
   And these words are doubtless the best chosen, and most fit to convey
   to us this idea of infinite love, considered as opposed, injured and
   affronted by selfish creatures, and acting accordingly.

   VI. The infinite love and goodness of God, which has been described
   above, which is opposed to every thing in creatures that is contrary to
   itself, and with which it is displeased, must be disposed to manifest
   this displeasure and opposition to sin, in all proper ways, and to
   punish the sinner according to his desert whenever this is necessary m
   order to show his displeasure, to assert and vindicate his own
   character, and secure and promote the greatest good of the whole. It is
   proper and desirable that infinite benevolence and goodness should be
   manifested and acted out, in all instances, where there is opportunity
   for it; and therefore in its opposition to sin. For if it does not
   appear how opposite the moral character of God is to all sin, it cannot
   be set in the most clear and advantageous light; but this cannot be
   done, if opposition to this character be not punished in any instance
   or way, according to its desert. Besides, when thus to punish is
   necessary, in order to support the character of God, and secure the
   general good; not to do it would be injustice to himself and the
   creation: Therefore to punish, in this case, is the proper and
   necessary exercise of justice and righteousness, which has been shewn
   is included in goodness, and is an exercise of the same. It is
   therefore evident, that God's manifesting his displeasure and anger
   with the creature who is an enemy to his goodness, is not only
   consistent with infinite benevolence, but an expression and exercise of
   love and goodness itself; and it would be contrary to the nature and
   dictates of the most perfect goodness not to punish. And it may be
   added, such punishment is not the least evidence of want of benevolence
   to the creature who is punished. When a judge orders a criminal who is
   guilty of treason against his king and country, to be put to death, he
   does nothing contrary to perfect benevolence and goodness, but this
   very conduct is an expression of it, and dictated by goodness itself;
   for he herein acts as a friend to his king and country; and not to
   inflict this punishment would be unfriendly, and contrary to true
   goodness. Nor does he manifest any want of benevolence to the criminal,
   or of a proper regard for his life and welfare, by punishing him
   according to his deserts, when the public and general good requires it.

   The disposition of the Most High to inflict punishment, and his
   actually inflicting evil on his creatures, as a testimony of his
   displeasure at sin, and to vindicate his own character, is often called
   vengeance in the scriptures; and is represented by his taking or
   executing vengeance, and being avenged on his enemies. And in this view
   he is frequently called. The mighty and terrible God, with whom is
   terrible majesty, &c. If God were not disposed to punish his creatures
   for their rebellion against him, and never did inflict evil on any for
   their sin, vengeance or vindictive justice could not he ascribed to
   him, nor would there be any thing terrible in his character; which
   would be an imperfection, and inconsistent with infinite benevolence or
   goodness, as has been shown. Therefore they who form notions of a love
   and goodness, in which there is no wrath and vengeance to punish
   enemies, nor any terrible majesty; and ascribe such love to God, have
   conceptions of his moral character which are essentially wrong, and
   very dishonourable to him.

   VII. It appears from what has been said, and from reason, as well as
   scripture, that the moral perfection of God, or the divine holiness,
   consists in one most simple, pure, uncompounded, unchangeable act;
   though to accommodate it to our imperfect way of conceiving, it be
   divided into parts, and a number of attributes, and called by different
   names, as it is exercised in different views and towards various and
   opposite objects.

   Benevolence or goodness is mercy, grace, compassion, patience, long
   suffering, &c. And the same benevolence is wisdom, justice, truth,
   faithfulness, complacence, displeasure, anger and wrath, in different
   views, and as it respects different objects.

   VIII. Absolute, uncontrollable sovereignty may be considered as
   included in the moral character of God. This is the same with
   omnipotent love or goodness; benevolence doing whatever it pleases,
   infinitely above any control or obligation to any other being.
   Omnipotence is indeed a natural perfection; but benevolence, clothed
   with omnipotence, or doing what it pleases, is the essence of God's
   moral perfection, and if we leave out the idea of this sovereignty, we
   shall have not only an imperfect, but a wrong view of divine
   benevolence. Indeed, if we should conceive of divine sovereignty, as
   some seem to have done, as consisting in God's doing what he will,
   merely because he will, and without any possible reason why he wills
   thus, rather than the contrary, this would be so far from a moral
   perfection, that it would be no perfection; but infinitely undesirable
   and unbecoming the Most High, representing him rather as an almighty
   despot and tyrant, than an infinitely wise and good being. Though God
   does what he pleases, and is infinitely above all obligation or control
   by creatures; yet he has a good reason for all his determinations, and
   always wills that which is most wise, and the dictate of infinite
   rectitude and goodness. It is most agreeable, desirable, and of
   infinite importance, that infinite goodness and wisdom should be
   sovereign goodness, that is, above all possible control, or obligation
   to creatures, which is inconsistent with its doing what it pleases, or
   with God's "fulfilling all the good pleasure of his goodness." All the
   friends of God who can confide in his goodness, wisdom and
   righteousness, must be pleased with this sovereignty, and rejoice that
   he is above all control, doing whatever he pleases, through all his
   dominions, and "working all things according to the council of his own
   will:" And the idea and acknowledgment of the sovereignty of God
   attends all their views and pleasing sense of his moral character. This
   is the same with rejoicing that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, which
   all good beings are represented to do; for to be under the least
   control, or involuntary obligation, is inconsistent with reigning,
   which consists in doing whatsoever he pleases. When it is said,
   however, that God reigns above all obligation to any, which is
   inconsistent with his doing what he pleases, it is not meant that he
   can in no instance be under obligation to his creatures. He may enter
   into voluntary obligation, by promise and covenant; for it may be truly
   said, that what God has promised he will do, he is obliged to fulfil.
   But all must be sensible that this is not in the least inconsistent
   with the most perfect sovereignty, as it has been now described.

   IX. God is independently, infinitely and unchangeably happy. And this
   may be considered as included in his moral perfection and character,
   and depending upon it; for his happiness is not properly a natural, but
   a moral good, and consists hi moral exercises and enjoyment. If God
   were not benevolence or love, he would not be happy; but his infinite
   greatness, understanding, &c. would render him infinitely miserable;
   therefore his moral character is essential to his felicity, and he is
   blessed forever, because he is unchangeably holy: And his happiness is
   a holy happiness. This attribute of God is essential to complete his
   infinitely glorious character; and is most pleasing and delightful to
   all his true friends; and their benevolence or good will to God is
   gratified and expressed in seeing and rejoicing in his infinite,
   unchangeable, independent felicity and blessedness; and adding their
   hearty amen to it, as St. Paul did when he spoke of it. "Who is over
   all, God blessed forever, Amen."

   Here it must however be observed, that when it is said God is
   independently happy, it is not meant that he takes no pleasure in his
   works of creation and providence, or delight in the holiness and
   happiness of his creatures; so that he would be as completely happy,
   were there no holy and happy creatures and no creation; for this is
   contrary to the scriptures, which represent God as pleased with his own
   works, and creating all things for his own pleasure; and as delighting
   in his holy creatures, and in exercising loving kindness, judgment and
   righteousness in the earth. So that it is not strictly true, that
   creatures add nothing to the enjoyment or happiness of God, even his
   essential happiness; and that he would have been as completely blessed
   forever, as he really is, had there been no creatures, which has been
   too often asserted, even in solemn addresses to God. Though the
   creation, with all its attendants and eternal consequences, be
   essential to the infinite happiness of God, and he could not have been
   so happy without it, this does not suppose him in the least dependent
   on creatures for his happiness, or for any thing else; for the creation
   is absolutely, perfectly, and in all respects, dependent on him; being
   only an emanation from his infinite fulness; and he is as independent
   of his creatures, as if they never had existed, and he took no pleasure
   in them. Nor is this inconsistent with the eternal, unchangeable
   happiness of God; for he from eternity perfectly enjoyed the creation,
   and every event that will take place to all eternity, without any
   change or succession of past, present and future, with respect to
   himself.

   The scriptures, indeed, speak of God as repenting that he had made man,
   and being grieved at his heart, which, when spoken of man, denote
   uneasiness and pain; but these expressions concerning God cannot
   reasonably be understood as meaning any such thing; and only denote
   that the great wickedness and misery of man are so contrary and
   displeasing to the holiness and goodness of God, that were he a man, or
   his goodness as limited and imperfect as that of man, it would be very
   grievous to him, and make him repent that man ever existed. And these
   words are doubtless wisely chosen, as best suited to convey this idea
   to us, and gives us a proper sense of the exceeding wickedness and
   misery of man in the sight of God; even so as to render his existence
   infinitely worse than nothing, should things take their natural course,
   and not be checked and overruled by infinite power and wisdom. If God
   speak to men, he must speak after the manner of men.

REFLECTIONS.

   From the view we have now taken of the evidence of the existence of
   God, and his character and perfection, we may infer the following
   things.

   1. What is meant by seeing God, or a true sensibility of his being and
   character. God is infinite power, knowledge, goodness, wisdom, justice
   and righteousness, unchangeable, eternal, every where present. To see
   God, is to have some proper discerning and sense of all these: and so
   as to make suitable impressions on the mind. And as the human mind is
   infinitely unequal to an adequate, comprehensive view of God; and
   cannot, at once, see all that it is capable of seeing, we view this
   infinite whole, by parts, and may sometimes attend to infinite power,
   more particularly, or to wisdom or goodness, and have a more affecting,
   pleasing sense of those, than of other perfections, though not
   excluding them. A discerning sensibility of any thing in God, is seeing
   him.

   II. We hence learn what a foundation and source there is in the being
   and perfections of God, for the complete and eternal happiness of those
   who know and love him. In God there is every thing that is agreeable
   and desirable to an infinite degree, and no possible blemish or defect;
   nothing that can be in the least disagreeable, to a mind of a right
   taste and disposition. His whole character is superlatively beautiful,
   bright and excellent, and it is impossible it should be properly
   discerned and understood, without giving the most noble and highest
   kind of enjoyment! And perfect discerning and love of this infinitely
   excellent and glorious being, accompanied with an assurance of his love
   and favour, must be the most perfect and highest kind of happiness of
   which we are capable, or can have any conception. In this view, the
   truth and propriety of our Saviour's words appear in a striking light.
   "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,
   and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." And as this infinitely
   excellent and glorious object is unchangeable, eternal and infinite, he
   whose happiness consists in the knowledge and enjoyment of him, must
   have not only a perfect and unfailing, but also an increasing
   happiness; for as the object of his knowledge and love is infinite,
   there is a foundation for an endless progression or increase of
   knowledge and love, which is the same with an endless increase of
   enjoyment and happiness.

   III. We hence learn the amazing folly, wickedness and misery of those
   who are displeased with the divine character and real enemies to it.
   This is true of all those who dislike the laws of God, and are
   unwilling to be under his government, and obey him; for the government
   and laws of God are all like himself, and an expression of his own
   character.

   There can be no greater crime, than direct opposition to God, and
   hatred of him, disaffection to his existence and character; for this
   must be criminal in proportion to the greatness of God, his importance
   to being in general, and the excellence of his character, and his
   authority over us, and his goodness exercised towards us. But he is
   infinitely great, and therefore his existence is of infinite worth and
   importance, and he is as excellent as he is great, is infinite love and
   friendship to being in general; and his authority over us is great in
   proportion to his greatness and perfection, our inferiority to him, and
   dependence upon him. And what is the just and certain consequence from
   this? If it be not that disaffection and opposition to him is
   infinitely criminal, that is, a crime of unlimited infinite magnitude;
   then it cannot be proved to be any crime at all. This is certain, if no
   reason can be given, or argument offered to prove that opposition to
   God, and rebellion against him, is wrong and criminal, which does not
   equally prove that the crime is infinitely great. Any one will
   doubtless be convinced of this, if he will attend to the point so much
   as to make a trial.

   The misery of such must be great. If infinite perfection and excellence
   give them no pleasure, but uneasiness and pain, they are of course shut
   out of all true happiness, and they have no object that can afford them
   any enjoyment, suited to their natural capacity and strong desires; and
   therefore must, in all their pursuits of happiness, meet with
   continual, vexatious disappointment, which must constantly render them
   very unhappy. And if they persist in this disaffection to God, and
   opposition to him, and so fall under the just and proper manifestations
   of his displeasure, and are punished in suffering evil answerable to
   their crimes, they must necessarily be miserable beyond all conception,
   and without any end!

   The folly of this is beyond all expression, and the greatest that can
   be. To turn away from the fountain of all good and perfection, and
   renounce the only object of true enjoyment and happiness, and seek it
   in a way in which it is not to be found, but issues in complete and
   endless misery: what instance of folly can be great like this! No
   wonder the scriptures call such fools, in an emphatical sense, as if
   this was the sum of all folly, and there were no fools but these.
   These, in the highest sense, and in the most striking manner, "call
   evil good, and good evil; put darkness for light, and light for
   darkness; bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter." The scriptures speak
   of such in the following language. "Be astonished, O ye heavens, at
   this, and be ye horribly afraid: For my people have committed two
   evils: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed
   them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. For my
   people are foolish, they have not known me, they are sottish children,
   and have no understanding: They are wise to do evil; but to do good
   they have no knowledge."

   IV. This subject leads us to reflect upon the very criminal blindness
   and great delusion of those who say in their hearts, "There is no God."
   The scriptures teach us there are such; and surely we must see the
   justice and propriety of calling them fools. "The fool hath said in his
   heart, there is no God." That there should be any such of the human
   race, is very shocking and deplorable; but it is more so to have it
   asserted by God, that this is true of all mankind in their natural
   state! That all are here declared to be such fools naturally, is
   certain from the context, which is quoted by St. Paul, and applied to
   all men. [27] What awful darkness and delusion must that be, in which
   they are, who, in the midst of the clearest light shining around them,
   do shut their eyes so as not to see the most evident and important
   truth, and to be quite blind to the most excellent, charming, glorious
   character! And that the heart of man should be thus stupid and blind,
   even when there is a rational conviction, and acknowledgment of the
   truth, is yet more shocking. This is the blindness of the heart, spoken
   of by St. Paul. [28] "Having the understanding darkened, being
   alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them,
   because of the blindness of their heart." When the light that is in men
   is, through the moral disorders of the mind, turned into such darkness,
   how great is that darkness!

   And this blindness and delusion must be criminal in proportion to the
   clear and abundant evidence of the truth, and the infinite importance
   and excellence of the object, which this darkness hides from the mind;
   for it is the blindness of the heart, and therefore a moral, voluntary
   blindness, and cannot be distinguished from disaffection and real
   opposition of the heart to the being and character of God; and
   consequently the whole of it is nothing but sin. In this light,
   therefore, the scriptures every where represent this sort of blindness
   and delusion, which originates from the heart, and consists essentially
   in the moral disorders and depravity of the mind. All sin is indeed
   moral darkness and delusion, it is opposed to all moral truth, and is
   in its own nature a sort of Atheism, as it does in all the exercises of
   it deny the God that is above. It is therefore so far from being
   unaccountable that the scriptures should assert, that they whose hearts
   are wholly under the dominion of sin, say in their hearts there is no
   God, that the reason of it may be easily seen; and it is most evident
   and certain, that it cannot be otherwise, and to assert the contrary is
   a very gross and palpable contradiction. When all the feelings and
   exercises of the heart are as if there were no pod, or are opposed to
   his being and moral character, then the heart says, there is no God:
   Therefore they who have no true virtue, no love to God, are in the
   scriptures said not to know God; but to be alienated from the life of
   God, and without God in the world. [29]

CHAP. III.

  CONCERNING THE UNITY OF GOD; AND THE TRINITY.

   THAT there is but one God, the scriptures every where assert; and this
   is agreeable to reason, and the works of creation and providence, which
   we behold. And the contrary supposition is most absurd, and
   undesirable, and really involves in it infinite evil. God must be a
   self existent being; which is the same with existing necessarily: But
   necessary existence must be infinite, as has been shewn. Therefore
   there can be but one first cause, who exists necessarily, and without
   beginning, for there can be but one infinite being. To suppose another,
   or a second, necessarily excludes the first, and to suppose the first,
   necessarily excludes the second, and any other infinite being. The same
   is evident from the consideration of the divine perfections: God is
   infinite power, infinite wisdom: But there cannot be two or more
   infinite wisdoms, &c. because this is a contradiction. Infinite power
   is all the power there is, or can be, and is clearly inconsistent with
   another power distinct from that, which is also infinite. Moreover, if
   we make the impossible supposition that there are two or more infinite
   beings, they must be perfectly alike in all respects, or not. If not
   perfectly alike and without any difference in any respect, then one or
   the other must be imperfect; for absolutely infinite perfection admits
   of no variation, or difference: so that if any two beings differ in any
   respect, they cannot both be absolutely perfect; therefore cannot both
   be God. But if they are perfectly alike in every respect and every
   thing, then they are perfectly one and the same; and the supposition
   destroys itself, being a direct contradiction. And there can be no
   possible need of more than one God; and therefore were this possible,
   it is not desirable. There can really be no more existence than one
   infinite being, or any addition to infinite perfection and excellence;
   therefore no more can be desired; and nothing can be effected or done,
   more than he can do. In a word, he is all-sufficient, and no addition
   can be made to this, or even conceived.

   Yea, it is so far from being desirable, that there should be more gods
   than one, were it possible, that it is most undesirable, and would be
   the greatest evil. Such a supposition would only tend to perplex the
   pious mind, not knowing which of the gods he did worship, or what god
   to love and adore, or in which to put his trust. There have been those
   in the christian world, who have supposed two gods, a good and an evil
   one. The former the author of all good, the latter of all evil. Were it
   so, there must be infinite variance and opposition between these
   beings, and it is impossible that the votaries of either should be
   happy. Such a belief, as the acknowledgment of more gods than one, is
   even worse than atheism itself; or rather is the worst sort of atheism;
   for such are really without any God.

   The scriptures teach us that there are three in this one God. Not three
   Gods; for this would be a contradiction; but that this infinite being
   exists in such a manner, as to be three distinct subsistencies or
   persons, and yet but one God. The most express declaration of this is
   by the apostle John. He says, "There are three that bear record in
   heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: And these are One."
   [30] This is also clearly asserted by Christ himself, when he directs
   his disciples to baptize all the proselytes to Christianity, "In the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." [31]
   Baptism being a covenant transaction between God and the creature, and
   a solemn act of worship, it would be idolatry to administer it in any
   other name but that of the only true God. Therefore these words warrant
   us to believe that the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, are God,
   and but one God, agreeable to what is said by the apostle John in the
   above cited passage, the Word and the Son meaning the same. This is
   also expressed by the apostle Paul, in his benediction or prayer, with
   which he concludes his second epistle to the Corinthians. "The grace of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the
   Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen." [32] Hereby God must be meant, the
   Father, mentioned in the above cited passages; and this is therefore
   parallel to them. And divinity is ascribed to each of these; by his
   blessing in each of these names, and making them the object of prayer.

   There are many passages in the Old Testament, which are agreeable to
   those in the New Testament, which have been mentioned, and represent a
   plurality or Trinity, as comprehended in the One true God: The
   following are some of them. It is remarkable that the Hebrew word,
   which is generally used for God, and is so translated, is commonly put
   in the plural, and not in the singular number. There is an instance of
   it the first time it is used in the Bible. "In the beginning God
   created the heaven and the earth." And agreeable to this it is said,
   "Remember thy Creators." [33] It is translated Creator, but the Hebrew
   word is plural. And the reason and propriety of it is discovered and
   best explained, by observing that a plurality, or Trinity, is included
   in the Creator of all things: for it is expressly and repeatedly
   asserted, that Jesus Christ created the world and all things in it. "In
   the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
   made, that was made." [34] "For by him (the Son of God) were all things
   created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth." [35] And creation
   is also ascribed to the Holy Spirit. "And the Spirit of God moved upon
   the face of the waters." [36] "By his Spirit he hath garnished the
   heavens. The Spirit of God hath made me." [37]

   Agreeable to this, God uses words in the plural number, when he is
   about to create man, and speaks as if there were a plurality of persons
   to do it. "And God said. Let us make man, in our image, after our
   likeness." [38] And this form of speech is repeatedly used. "And the
   Lord God said. Behold, the man is become like one of us. And the Lord
   said--Let us go down, and there confound their language." [39]

   There is a remarkable passage in the prophecy of Isaiah, which
   represents a plurality, or three in Jehovah, or the Lord of Hosts. The
   Seraphims "cried one unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
   Lord of Hosts. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I
   send, and who will go for us?" [40] The plurality is here expressed by
   the plural pronoun, us. "Who will go for us?" And the Trinity is
   expressed by using the word holy three times successively; of which
   there is no instance of the kind in the Bible, when a single person,
   which is in no sense plural, is addressed. There is an instance of the
   same, indeed, when the same Being is addressed by the living creatures
   which John saw and heard. "And they rest not day and night, saying,
   Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."
   [41] But that a plurality and a Trinity, comprehended in Jehovah, is
   designed to be expressed here by these words, is confirmed and made
   certain, by the reference which is made to this passage, in the New
   Testament. All will grant that he who is called the Father, in the New
   Testament, when joined with the Son or Word, and the Holy Ghost, is
   intended or included in the word Jehovah, or the Lord of Hosts, in this
   passage in Isaiah. And the apostle John, referring to it, says, "These
   things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him." That is,
   of Jesus Christ. [42] The apostle Paul, when he quotes some of the
   words of this same passage in Isaiah, says, "Well spake the Holy Ghost,
   by Isaiah the Prophet, unto our fathers." [43] So that the glory of
   Jehovah was the glory of the Son, or Jesus Christ; and what was spoken
   of the Lord of Hosts, was spoken of Christ the Son of God. And what the
   Lord of Hosts said by Isaiah, the Holy Ghost said. It is hence certain,
   that these three, the Father, the Son, or the Word, and the Holy Ghost,
   into whose name christians are baptized, and in whose name the Apostles
   blessed, and who bear record in heaven, were included in the vision
   which Isaiah had of the Lord of Hosts. And who that attends to this
   scriptural view of the case, can doubt when it is said. Who will go for
   us? the plurality of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost is intended; and
   that when the Seraphim adored the Lord of Hosts, and cried, saying,
   Holy, holy, holy, there is reference to those three.

   From the passages of scripture which have been now mentioned, to prove
   there is a plurality or Trinity in the one true God, it is also proved
   that the Word, the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is God, and as
   really, and as much included in the Deity, in Jehovah, as is the
   Father: And that this is equally true of the Holy Ghost. But the
   evidence of the real divinity of Jesus Christ, will appear yet more
   clear and strong, by examining the scripture more particularly on this
   point. But as this will be done in a more proper place in a following
   section, it is omitted here. And the divinity of the Holy Ghost will
   now be more particularly considered.

   In addition to the evidence of this, from the scriptures, which have
   been produced above, a number of other passages of scripture will now
   be mentioned, from which it appears, that the Holy Ghost is God, and
   included in the Godhead.

   Christ says, "Except a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot see the
   kingdom of God. What is born of the Spirit, is spirit." [44] And the
   apostle Paul says, "christians are saved by the washing of
   regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost." [45] The apostle John
   speaks often of the same change, and renovation, common to all
   christians, as being born of God. [46] The inference is, that the Holy
   Spirit is God; since to be born of the Spirit, and to be born of God,
   is precisely the same thing. This renovation, by which men are born of
   God, and born of the Spirit, is called in scripture the new creature,
   or new creation. And it is indeed a greater work than the creation of
   the world; therefore the Spirit who thus renews men must be God.

   "Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost? Thou hast
   not lied unto men, but unto God." [47] Here God and the Holy Ghost are
   synonymous, and mean the same thing; as much as if it had been said,
   thou hast lied unto God the Holy Ghost. "The things of God knoweth no
   man. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
   neither can he know them." [48] From these two sentences compared, it
   appears that the things of God, and the things of the Spirit of God,
   express the same thing. But if the things of the Spirit of God are the
   things of God, does it not follow that the Spirit of God is God? "All
   scripture is given by inspiration of God. Holy men spake as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost." [49] To be inspired by God, and moved by the
   Holy Ghost, is the same; therefore the Holy Ghost is God. [50]

   These three are spoken of, or addressed, in the scriptures, in such
   terms as are used to denote a distinct personality, such as I, thou,
   he, or him. Thus the Father speaks of himself, and the Son; and thus
   the Son speaks to the Father, and of him, and of the Holy Spirit; of
   which there are many instances, which must have been observed by those
   who read the Bible.

   It is thought that the use of the above mentioned personal epithets, is
   a sufficient warrant to distinguish the three in the divine Trinity, by
   the word person. But it must be carefully observed, that when this word
   is applied to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as three distinct
   persons, it does not import the same distinction which is expressed by
   it when applied to men. It means nothing inconsistent with the highest
   perfection, or with these three being really and most perfectly one
   God. Nor is it pretended that this word, when used in this instance,
   can be so defined as to give any clear and adequate idea of a subject
   so mysterious and infinitely incomprehensible. They who object to the
   word person, and will not use it because not applicable to the three
   who are one, may doubtless, with equal reason, object to any word which
   can be used, even the word Trinity, or three, which the apostle John
   uses, and to the personal words so often mentioned in scripture.
   However, if they who object to the word person, will allow that,
   according to the scripture, the one only true God does subsist in such
   a manner, and so infinitely above our comprehension, that there are
   three, viz. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in this one jehovah; and that
   this distinction and manner of existence is peculiar and essential to
   the infinite eternal Being as the most perfect, happy and glorious mode
   of existence, independent of any divine operations ad extra, and the
   proper foundation of these: If they will grant this, it is presumed
   none will contend with them about the word person.

   It is acknowledged, that this is incomprehensible by us, we not being
   able to form any precise or adequate idea of three persons in one God,
   but as there is no inconsistence or contradiction in this, our not
   being able to comprehend it, is no reason why we should not believe it,
   when it is revealed; for if we will not believe any thing respecting
   God, which we cannot comprehend and is therefore above our reason, we
   shall not believe there is a God. If there be a God, he does exist
   without beginning or succession; but this is as much above our
   comprehension, as that he subsists in three persons; and we cannot have
   a more clear understanding of the former, than of the latter. God, who
   is infinitely great; and infinitely above us, exists in a manner
   infinitely above our conception: And if we will not believe what God
   has revealed of himself, because it is above our reason, and
   incomprehensible by us, we shall act a most unreasonable part; for
   reason teaches us, that God is incomprehensible in more respects than
   one; and in how many we know not. God has been pleased, for wise
   reasons, to reveal one instance of this, which we otherwise could not
   have known; and there can be no reason against believing it: and
   therefore to reject it, is most unreasonable and absurd.

   There may be innumerable truths respecting this infinitely
   incomprehensible Being, which would be as much above the reach of our
   understanding and reason, as this is, were they revealed; for but a
   very small portion is yet known of him. This truth, respecting a
   Trinity of persons in the one God, is revealed, because it was
   necessary to be known and believed, in order to understand the gospel,
   revealing a way for the salvation of sinners, in which each of those
   Three are concerned, in different respects and views, and distinct from
   each other: For had there not been this distinction of persons in God,
   there would have been no foundation or sufficiency in him for the
   exercise of mercy, in the recovery of apostate man. In this view, the
   doctrine of the Trinity, one God subsisting in three persons, appears
   to be an important and essential doctrine of christianity.

   There have been many attempts to explain this doctrine, and shew the
   particular manner of the distinct subsistence of the three persons in
   the divine Trinity; but these have often been so far from giving any
   light and satisfaction on the subject, that they have only darkened
   counsel, by words without knowledge; and rather given advantage to the
   opposers of the doctrine, and increased their prejudices. Therefore
   nothing of this kind will be attempted here. It may however be
   observed, that this manner of subsistence in three persons, though
   incomprehensible to us, may be essential to the infinitely perfect
   Being, and that otherwise he would not be absolutely perfect,
   all-sufficient, and infinitely blessed. Have we not reason to conclude
   that this distinction of three in one, is that in which the most
   perfect and happy society consists, in which love and friendship is
   exercised to the highest perfection, and with infinite enjoyment, and
   felicity? And that the most perfect and happy society of creatures,
   united together forever, in the kingdom of God, in the strongest,
   sweetest love and friendship, is an emanation from this infinite three
   one, as the fountain and pattern of all happy society and friendship;
   and the highest possible resemblance and imitation of it? This idea
   seems to be suggested, if not necessarily implied, in what Christ says
   in his prayer to the Father. "That they all may be one. as thou,
   Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us. That
   they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me, that
   they may be made perfect in one. That the love wherewith thou hast
   loved me, may be in them, and I in them."

CHAP. IV.

  ON THE DECREES OF GOD.

   HAVING considered what God is, the next inquiry will be concerning the
   divine operations and works. And in these are included the decrees,
   which are first to be considered; as they are the foundation and origin
   of all his exertions and works, ad extra, in creation and providence:
   For God worketh all things after the council of his own will. Indeed,
   every thing which is properly an effect, has its foundation in the
   purpose or decree of God, as its original cause, without which it could
   not have taken place. And every such effect is fixed and made sure of
   existence by the divine decree, and infallibly connected with it.

   The assembly of Divines, in their shorter catechism, have given a
   concise definition of the decrees of God, which is both rational and
   agreeable to the holy scriptures, viz. "The decrees of God are his
   eternal purpose, according to the council of his own will, whereby for
   his own glory he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass." And in
   their confession of faith, in words a little different, "God from all
   eternity did, by the most wise and holy council of his own will, freely
   and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass."

   The decrees of God must be from eternity, and not in time. He who
   exists without beginning, absolutely independent, omnipotent, infinite
   in understanding and wisdom, must know what is wisest and best, or what
   is most agreeable to him with respect to all possible effects or
   events; and therefore must determine what should actually take place,
   and what should not. Such determination or decree is, in such a sense,
   essential to the divine existence, that the former must be coeval with
   the latter, and is necessarily implied in it. Besides, if any of the
   purposes or decrees of God be in time, or later than his existence, he
   must be changeable, by having new determinations, new views and
   designs, which he had not before; which is inconsistent with his
   necessary existence, his infinity, and absolute perfection, all which
   are essential to God, as has been proved.

   Therefore in scripture the purpose or decrees of God are said to be
   eternal, "Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the
   world," or from eternity, as it should have been rendered. If God's
   knowing all his works from eternity does not mean his purpose
   concerning them, it necessarily implies this; for how could he know
   what he would do, if he had no will or purpose to do? "According to the
   eternal purpose, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord." [51]

   Though God be sovereign in his decrees, and all his operations; that
   is, he has determined every thing and every event just as he pleased,
   being infinitely above all control by the will or power of any one; and
   under no obligation to any other being; yet they are not arbitrary,
   that is, determined and fixed without any reason why he should purpose
   and decree as he has done, rather than the contrary, or otherwise: But
   they are all infinitely wise and good, or the dictates of the most
   perfect wisdom. For if God decree or act, he must decree and act like
   himself, an infinitely wise Being. Infinite wisdom is able or
   sufficient to form the wisest and best plan of creation and providence,
   of a world or system, be it ever so large and complicated, and however
   many creatures, things and events, it may comprehend; and though it
   include innumerable existencies and events without any end. Such a plan
   is therefore formed and fixed upon by the divine decrees, which is of
   all other possible plans the wisest and the best: For if it were
   otherwise it would be so far disagreeable, defective, unwise, and
   wrong. The scripture therefore ascribes wisdom to God in all his works,
   by which his wise purpose and decrees are brought into effect. "O Lord,
   how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all." [52] "O
   the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
   unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" [53]

   The decrees of God are unchangeable; they are fixed from eternity, and
   cannot be altered, in any degree, or with respect to any thing, event,
   or circumstance. "The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the
   thoughts of his heart to all generations." [54] "He is in one mind, and
   who can turn him?" [55] That the divine purpose is unalterable, is as
   evident and certain as that God is unchangeable; for alteration of
   God's design or decree is a change in God: And this necessarily
   supposes imperfection. And it is unspeakably undesirable and dreadful
   to suppose, that the infinitely wise and good purpose and decree of
   God, as all his decrees are, should be capable of any possible change
   or alteration; so as to fail of the most exact and perfect execution.
   And the more stable and fixed the infinitely wise decrees of God are,
   and the farther from all possible change, the more agreeable, and the
   greater ground of joy, are they to every one who is a friend of wisdom.

   It may be farther observed, concerning the decrees of God, that they
   extend to every thing, and every event, though ever so small, compared
   with others, and every the most minute circumstance that takes place,
   or will exist to eternity. For every one of these are necessary parts
   of the most wise and perfect plan; otherwise they could have no
   existence in it. And if one of these had been left out of the divine
   plan, it would have been so far less perfect, and really defective. It
   is not to be supposed that of any two possible existences, events, or
   circumstances of existence, there should be no difference in any
   respect; so that one could not be preferred to the other, by infinite
   wisdom, as better and more suited to answer the end proposed, than the
   other; though we, or finite discerning, may not be able to perceive any
   difference: Therefore infinite wisdom discerns and fixes upon that
   which is preferable and best, in every instance. No two proposed or
   possible objects, events or circumstances, being perfectly alike or
   equal in the view of omniscience, there is ground of choice and
   preference; so that the divine determination respecting the actual
   existence of all these, and their taking place in all respects exactly
   as they do, or will, is, in every instance, most wise: and no thing,
   event, or circumstance, would be in any other respect otherwise
   consistent with infinite wisdom.

   Jesus Christ teaches us that God's providence and care extend to the
   smallest things, and most minute circumstances, when he says to his
   disciples, "Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one
   of them is forgotten before God, or shall fall on the ground, without
   your heavenly Father: But the very hairs of your head are all
   numbered."

   It may be of some importance to observe here, that there is a
   distinction and difference between the decrees of God, and his
   foreknowledge, as the words are commonly used. Divine foreknowledge is
   God's foreseeing future existence and events, and knowing from eternity
   what would take place in all futurity, to eternity, or without end.
   This foreknowledge is not only to be distinguished from the decree; but
   must be considered as, in order of nature, consequent upon the
   determination and purpose of God, and dependent upon it. For the
   futurition or futurity of all things depends upon the decrees of God;
   by these every created existence, and every event, with all their
   circumstances, are fixed and made certain; and in consequence of their
   being thus: decreed, they are the objects of foreknowledge; for they
   could not be known to be future, unless they were so; and they were
   made so by the divine decree, and nothing else. If we may so speak, God
   foreknew all things, that were to come to pass, by knowing his own
   purpose and decrees, by which their existence was made certain. Had God
   decreed nothing respecting future existences, by creation and
   providence, there could have been no foreknowledge of any thing
   whatsoever. Hence the decrees of God may be certainly inferred from his
   foreknowledge; for the former must be as extensive as the latter; and
   nothing can be foreknown or seen to have a future existence, the future
   existence of which has not been made certain by a divine decree.

   All future existences, events and actions, must have a cause of their
   futurition, or there must be a reason why they are future, or certainly
   to take place, rather than not. This cause must be the divine decree
   determining their future existence, or it must be in the future
   existences themselves; for there is no other possible supposition. But
   the future existences could not be the cause of their own futurition;
   for this supposes them to exist as a cause, and to have influence,
   before they have any existence, even from eternity. And if they may be
   the cause of their own futurition, or become future of themselves, then
   they might actually exist of themselves; for by becoming future, their
   existence is made certain and necessary; therefore that which makes
   them certainly future, is really the cause of their existence. This
   therefore can be nothing but the divine decree, determining their
   future existence, without which nothing could be future, consequently
   nothing could be known to be future. They therefore who deny the
   doctrine of God's decrees, and yet acknowledge the omniscience of God,
   and that all future events were known to him from eternity, are really
   inconsistent: for if the world, or any creature, or any event, could be
   certainly future, without being made so by God, it can actually exist
   without him: for the existence of it is certain and necessary, and it
   cannot but exist, when once it becomes certainly future.

   Therefore, because the foreknowledge of God does necessarily imply and
   involve his decrees, the former is sometimes put for the latter, in the
   inspired writings. The following are instances of it. "Him, being
   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have
   taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain." [56] "For whom he
   did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of
   his Son." [57] "God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew."
   [58] "Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father." [59]

   As the decrees of God are most wise, this necessarily supposes some end
   in view, and that which is best, the most excellent, important, and
   desirable that can be; for wisdom consists in proposing and pursuing
   such an end, in ways and by means in the best manner adapted to
   accomplish that end. When no end is in view to be accomplished by any
   purpose or work, if this can be, there is no wisdom; and if there be an
   end proposed and pursued, if this be not the best that can be proposed
   and effected, the purpose and pursuit is not wisdom but folly. And if
   the end proposed be the highest and best that can be; yet if the means
   fixed upon to accomplish that end, be not in all respects the best
   suited to accomplish the end proposed, this must be a defect of wisdom.
   Therefore infinite wisdom discerns without a possibility of mistake,
   what is the best end, most worthy to be set up and pursued, and fixes
   on this end; and discerns and determines the best means by which this
   end shall in the best manner be answered. And this determination is the
   same with the decrees of God, and involves or comprehends every thing
   that comes to pass, every event, great and small, with every
   circumstance, be it ever so minute; and fixes them all; unerring wisdom
   being exercised with respect to them all; so that to make the least
   alteration in any thing, event, or circumstance, would render the whole
   plan less perfect and wise. "The work of God is perfect. Whatsoever God
   doth, it shall be forever: Nothing can be put to it, nor any thing
   taken from it." That which is perfect is not capable of the least
   alteration, without being rendered imperfect and defective. This is
   true of the infinitely wise plan of the divine operations, and all
   future events, which was formed by the eternal purpose and decrees of
   God.

   If it be inquired, What that best, most important and desirable end can
   be, which must be proposed by infinite wisdom? The answer must be, that
   God himself, or that which respects him, is the end of his decrees and
   works. When the divine plan of operations was laid, there was nothing
   but God existing, or to be set up, or regarded as an end; and how could
   future existence be made an ultimate end with him, in proposing and
   causing it to exist? And when it does exist, it is infinitely less
   considerable and respectable than God; and as the dust in the balance;
   yea, as nothing, in comparison with Him. It would therefore be contrary
   to reason, and therefore contrary to infinite wisdom, to make creatures
   or the creation, considered as something distinct from God, the object
   of supreme respect in God's designs and works, and not God himself,
   whose existence is infinitely greater, more important and excellent,
   and who is the sum of all being. Wisdom must have supreme respect to
   him in every design, and in every operation, as the first and the last,
   and all in all. Which is the same as to say, God makes himself his end
   in all his purposes and operations.

   Divine revelation confirms this, in which God speaks of himself as the
   first and the last, the beginning and the ending, by which he
   represents himself as the first cause and supreme or last end of all
   things. And this is confirmed by the following passages, "For of him,
   and through him, and to him, are all things. [60] For by him were all
   things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
   invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
   powers: All things were created by him, and for him." [61] Agreeable to
   this it is said, "The Lord hath made all things for himself." [62]

   God makes himself his end in his decrees and works, in being pleased
   with the exercise and expression, exhibition and display of his own
   infinite perfection and excellence: And determining to do this in the
   best manner, and to the highest possible degree, in his works of
   creation and providence. This exhibition, display or manifestation, is
   in divine revelation called the glory of God; and is there abundantly
   represented as the supreme end of all God's designs and works, which
   any one properly attentive to the Bible must have observed: It is
   therefore thought needless to illustrate this by a particular attention
   to those passages of scripture by which it is evident. This exhibition
   and display of the divine perfections, necessarily implies and
   involves, as essential to it, the communication of his own holiness and
   happiness to the greatest possible degree, which consists in effecting
   or producing the greatest possible moral excellence and felicity in his
   creation, or by his works. This consists hi the highest, the greatest
   possible good or happiness of creatures, whose capacities,
   circumstances, and their number, and all other things, circumstances
   and events, are contrived and adapted in the best manner to answer this
   end.

   The moral excellence and perfection of God consists in love, or
   goodness, which has been proved in a former chapter. This infinite love
   of an infinite Being, is infinite felicity. This consists in his
   infinite regard to himself as the fountain and sum of all being; and
   ills pleasure and delight in himself, in his own infinite excellence
   and perfection; and in the highest possible exercise, exhibition and
   display of his infinite fulness, perfection and glory. And his pleasure
   in the latter, so as to make it the supreme and ultimate end of all his
   works, necessarily involves and supposes his pleasure and delight in
   the happiness of his creatures. If he be pleased with the greatest
   possible exercise, communication, and exhibition of his goodness, he
   must be pleased with the happiness of creatures, and the greatest
   possible happiness of the creation, because the former so involves the
   latter that they cannot be separated; and may be considered as one and
   the same thing; and doubtless are but one in the view of the all
   comprehending mind; though we, whose conceptions are so imperfect and
   partial, are apt to conceive of the glory of God, and the good of the
   creature, as two distinct things, and different ends to be answered, in
   God's designs and works. [63]

   Thus whatsoever comes to pass from the beginning of time to eternity is
   foreordained, and fixed from eternity by the infinitely wise counsel
   and unchangeable purpose of God. He being infinite in understanding,
   power, wisdom and goodness, must perfectly know, what was the wisest
   and best plan of creation and providence, of operations and events,
   which includes everything desirable and good, and excludes whatever is
   not so; and he must fix upon this plan, without any possible error, and
   determine to prosecute it; for if any thing be left undetermined and
   uncertain, even the most minute existence, event, or circumstance and
   appendage of any existence or event, it must be owing to a defect in
   wisdom and goodness, or in power to execute. No truth ever was, or can
   be more demonstrably certain than this; and none can be more agreeable
   to wisdom and goodness, or more important. If a man be to contrive and
   make any machine or building, the end which it is to answer must be in
   view, and fixed; and the plan of his operation must be laid, including
   every thing that is to come into the composition, so as in the best
   manner to answer the end designed. And the more skill and wisdom the
   workman has, the more clear and perfect will be his idea and view of
   the whole plan, and of every part, even the most minute, which is
   included in it; and the more fixed and determined he will be to
   prosecute this plan, without the least variation from it. And if he
   have skill and wisdom sufficient to lay a perfect plan of operation,
   without the least mistake or error, he will be esteemed and prized
   above all others of less skill; and the more certain and fixed his plan
   of operation is, and the farther he is from a disposition to make any
   alteration, or a possibility of being impeded in his work or unable to
   execute his design, according to his present purpose, the more
   agreeable it will be to all who are interested in his work which he is
   to execute; and to all who have the least spark of wisdom and goodness;
   and that in proportion to the excellence and importance of the design.

   What a source of unspeakable satisfaction and joy must it then be to
   all the children of wisdom, that the most High, omnipotent, infinitely
   wise, just and good, has laid a plan to express and exhibit his own
   character; which therefore must be wise and good, like himself; and
   which comprehends and fixes every thing, and all events, from the
   greatest to the least, from the first to the last; and which is
   absolutely perfect, infinitely wise, and comprehends all possible good;
   so that not the least thing, event, or the smallest appendage and
   circumstance, can be altered, left out, or added, without rendering it
   less desirable, excellent and perfect! And is it possible that any one
   who is not unfriendly to infinite wisdom and goodness, and to the most
   absolute perfection and excellence, should have the least objection to
   this? Yea, will he not highly approve of it, and make it the ground of
   his chief comfort and joy? And is not this infinitely preferable to a
   world and series of events, if this were possible, fixed by blind fate,
   or existing and taking place by mere, undesigning chance? Most
   certainly this demonstrable truth, that God has, by the infinitely wise
   counsel of his own will, from eternity foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass, is infinitely more desirable than any other supposition whatever,
   were it possible; and is a foundation on which a pious mind, a true
   friend to God, may rest with the greatest security and satisfaction.
   And if he should give this up, what support and comfort could he have?
   Where could he fly for refuge from evil? He must fall into the most
   awful darkness, and horror.

   Objection, It is granted that this doctrine of the divine decrees, as
   it has now been stated, might readily be admitted as certain and
   desirable, were it possible, and was it consistent with known fact,
   which it most certainly is not: Therefore, however great and clear the
   evidence of this doctrine may seem to be; and though it appear most
   desirable that all events should be determined by infinite wisdom and
   goodness; yet it cannot be true, because it is impossible and
   inconsistent with what has actually taken place. It is impossible,
   because inconsistent with moral government, and with the freedom and
   moral agency of creatures; and so excludes all possibility of virtue or
   vice, praise or blame, reward or punishment. And if this doctrine were
   consistent with all this; yet it is inconsistent with the evil which
   has taken place, both moral and natural evil, which could have no place
   in a plan formed and fixed by infinite wisdom and goodness, and
   comprehending the greatest possible good. Besides, to suppose all this
   evil was foreordained by God, and takes place in consequence of his
   purpose and decree, represents the Most High as the origin, cause or
   author of it all, even all the moral evil in the universe: And what can
   be more shocking and horrible than this!

   In this objection are three distinct things, which re« quire a separate
   and particular consideration.

   First. It is to be inquired. Whether the doctrine of God's decrees,
   whereby he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, is inconsistent
   with the liberty and moral agency of creatures, by fixing all events
   and all actions, so as to render them infallibly certain. And here it
   may be proper to observe several things, in order to prepare the way to
   a more clear determination of this question.

   1. If the doctrine of God's decrees be inconsistent with the freedom
   and moral agency of man; then the foreknowledge of God is equally so:
   Therefore the objection under consideration is as much against the
   latter, as it is against the former. For if it be foreknown what events
   and what actions will take place, then they must be fixed and certain;
   since it is a contradiction to say, an event is certainly foreknown,
   and yet it is uncertain whether it will come to pass; just as great and
   palpable a contradiction as to say, an event is certain and fixed, and
   yet precarious and uncertain whether it will take place or not. Nothing
   can be the object of the divine foreknowledge, which is not fixed as
   certainly future. If it be not fixed by the decree of God, it must be
   fixed by blind fate, or by something else, if this were possible; and
   this surely is as inconsistent with the freedom of man, as if fixed by
   the counsel and decree of God: Yea, infinitely more so. This is
   observed, to show that he who makes the objection under consideration,
   and yet believes the foreknowledge of God, is inconsistent with
   himself; and must, would he be consistent, withdraw his objection, or
   give up the doctrine of God's foreknowledge.

   II. It being confessedly so very important and desirable that
   whatsoever comes to pass should be determined and fixed by infinite
   wisdom and goodness, if this can be done consistent with moral
   government; and since God is infinitely great, powerful and wise, there
   is reason to conclude this is not impossible; but that both are
   perfectly consistent: Is it not presumption and arrogance for fallen
   man, ignorant and deceived in a thousand things, peremptorily, and with
   assurance to determine that it is impossible with God to make
   creatures, who shall be absolutely dependent upon him, in all respects,
   and so as to act perfectly conformable to his most wise plan, and
   fulfil his counsel, and yet exercise all the freedom necessary to moral
   agency? If this were certainly known to imply a contradiction, it might
   safely be pronounced impossible: But since many things have appeared to
   short sighted, partial man, inconsistent and impossible, and have been
   confidently pronounced to be such, which afterwards have been found to
   be otherwise, it may be so in this case. And if both these be really
   and perfectly consistent, how happy! Let this point then be examined
   without prejudice, and with the utmost care and attention, reviewing it
   again and again. And if the consistence may be discovered, what matter
   of consolation and joy will it afford!

   III. It does not appear from our feelings and experience, that a
   previous certainty respecting our actions in the least takes away or
   diminishes our freedom and moral agency. We feel ourselves free and
   accountable in our voluntary actions; and the supposition of a previous
   certainty that we should act just as we do, does not alter our feeling
   ourselves free, and knowing we act so, so far as our experience is to
   be regarded. Is not this a just ground of suspicion at least, that all
   objections and reasonings against this, by which it is concluded to be
   impossible, are fallacious and without foundation: Especially when it
   is considered, that a mistake respecting the divine decrees and
   superintendency, determining and fixing all events, which are so
   infinitely high, and above our reach; or about the nature of human
   liberty, &c. will lead to groundless and very erroneous conclusions on
   this point?

   IV. Since it is so consonant to reason, and even demonstrably certain,
   that a Being of infinite understanding, power and wisdom, who is
   absolutely independent, and on whom all creatures and events wholly
   depend, must determine and foreordain whatsoever comes to pass; and at
   the same time it is equally certain that men are free and moral agents:
   And since Divine Revelation most expressly and abundantly asserts both
   these; he who admits and believes them both to be true, however unable
   he may be to reconcile them, and show or conceive how they are
   consistent, acts a more reasonable and wise part, than those who reject
   one as not true, and impossible, merely because they cannot see their
   consistence.

   There are innumerable instances in the scriptures of God's determining
   and foretelling the voluntary actions of men, and the events dependent
   on them: And yet, in those actions, they are represented as free and
   accountable, as sinful or virtuous, and blameable or commendable; as
   much so, as if their actions had not been thus fixed and foreknown.
   There is not perhaps a prediction in the Bible, which is not an
   instance of this; and most of those predictions do fix and declare to
   be certain, innumerable voluntary actions of men, which are either
   expressly foretold, or necessarily implied in the prophecy. Only a few
   instances, out of the many, will here be mentioned, as sufficient to
   illustrate this observation. The conduct of Pharaoh and the Egyptians,
   towards the children of Israel, was determined and foretold long before
   it took place, to Abraham and to Moses: And yet they were considered
   and treated as moral agents, and culpable, and were punished for those
   very actions which were foreordained and foretold. God said to Abraham,
   "Know of a surety, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is
   not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four
   hundred years. And also, that nation, whom they shall serve, will I
   judge." And God told Abraham that he would bring his seed from Egypt
   into the land of Canaan, after four hundred years, which event depended
   on millions of millions of voluntary free actions of that people, and
   of others. And he promised the same thing to Moses, and that they
   should hearken to him, when he seat him into Egypt to deliver them; and
   that they should worship God in Mount Sinai; and he said to Moses, "I
   am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go. And I will stretch
   out my hand, and smite Egypt, and after that, he will let you go."

   God told Moses that the people of Israel would apostatize after his
   death, and practise idolatry, &c. and that he would punish them for it.
   Upon which Moses said to them, "I know that after my death ye will
   utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have
   commanded you: And evil will befal you in the latter days, because ye
   will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger, through
   the work of your hands."

   The rise, grandeur and ruin of particular kingdoms and empires are
   foretold as fixed and certain, which depended on innumerable voluntary
   actions of innumerable men, and could not be accomplished without them;
   which therefore must be fixed and certain. The Persian, Grecian and
   Roman empires, are instances of this, as well as many other kingdoms.

   The evil that Hazael did to the children of Israel was foretold, and
   therefore determined and fixed, long before he did it. And the
   particular actions of Cyrus, and of Josiah, were determined and
   foretold long before they were born: Yet this did not render them the
   less free and accountable as moral agents, in what they did.

   But one instance more, among the many thousands that might be produced
   from the Bible, will now be mentioned. It is that of the Jews
   crucifying our Lord. It was before fixed and written that thus it must
   be; and by their voluntary conduct in this affair, God fulfilled those
   things which he before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets:
   And, in putting Christ to death, they did the very things which his
   hand and counsel determined before to be done. Surely he who will well
   attend to this must be sensible that to say, that God's foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass, is inconsistent with the liberty and moral
   agency of man, does at the same time affirm, at least implicitly, that
   it is impossible the Bible should be from God.

   Therefore, seeing the previous infallible certainty of all things which
   come to pass is necessarily implied in the foreknowledge of God, and
   the former cannot be rejected, without denying the latter: And since
   reason teaches that a Being of infinite power, wisdom and goodness, on
   whom all things absolutely depend for their existence, and every mode
   and circumstance of it, must determine by the counsel of his own will,
   and foreordain whatsoever comes to pass; and that it is infinitely
   important and desirable that he should do it, and that all events
   should be determined by infinite wisdom, rather than by any thing else:
   And since, according to our own feeling and experience, this is
   consistent with our freedom and moral agency: And since Divine
   Revelation abundantly asserts both these; and declares men to be moral
   agents, and accountable in those actions which have been foreordained
   and fixed by divine counsel and decrees; and therefore to deny these to
   be consistent, is really to renounce the Bible: When all these things
   are well considered, will it not appear to be amazing boldness, and the
   height of stupidity and arrogance, in a fallen, short sighted, ignorant
   man, liable to a thousand prejudices and mistakes, confidently, and
   without hesitation to pronounce these two doctrines absolutely
   inconsistent with each other? How much more modest, reasonable, and
   becoming us, is it to believe them both to be true and perfectly
   consistent? And if any have not yet been able to see how they may be
   reconciled; let them not rashly conclude that no man ever did, or ever
   will see their consistence with each other, and reduce it to a plain
   demonstration: Nor ought they themselves so to despair of receiving
   light and full satisfaction on this point, as to neglect ail means and
   attempts to obtain it; but aught rather, with a proper sense of the
   importance of the matter, and their accountableness to God, for their
   belief and feelings respecting it; and with humble, fervent, constant
   application to the Father of Lights, for a wise and understanding
   heart; carefully to attend to the subject, and diligently improve every
   opportunity and advantage they may have to obtain that understanding
   which is pleasant to the soul, and more precious than the finest gold.

   Attention to the foregoing preliminaries, it is hoped, has, in some
   measure, prepared the mind to a careful and candid examination of this
   point, about which there has been so much dispute in our world.
   Therefore the question will now be resumed, which is, How the divine
   decrees, foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass, can be consistent with
   the freedom and moral agency of man?

   There can be no light respecting this question; nor can it be
   determined, without proper, precise and consistent ideas of both these
   subjects, about which the inquiry is made, the divine decrees, and the
   freedom essential to moral agency. Without this, it will be impossible
   to determine whether they be consistent with each other, or not; and if
   we affirm, or deny, we shall talk in the dark, "not knowing what we
   say, or whereof we affirm." My neighbour now comes into my study, and
   asks, whether a table he has made for me, can be introduced and have
   room here? I ask him, what is the length and breadth of it? He answers,
   it is three yards square. I tell him, it can then be of no use to me,
   nor can it be introduced. He is confident I am mistaken. And after some
   dispute, we at length conclude to take a common measure and apply it to
   the table, and to my door and study. Upon this the matter is soon
   decided, and it is found that the former agrees exactly with the
   latter; for his yard-stick was found to be but twelve inches long.

   To prevent, as far as possible, all mistakes concerning the doctrine of
   God's decrees, it must be observed, that it may be justly considered as
   a medium between the two extremes, viz. of a supposed fatality in all
   things; every thing, and all events, being unalterably fixed by blind
   and undesigning fate on the one hand, and on the other, of a perfect
   contingence and uncertainty respecting all future events, there being
   no cause or reason of their taking place; but all things come to pass
   by mere chance. It would be infinitely undesirable, and dreadful, if
   either of these opposite extremes were true, or possible, as they
   certainly are not, each of them implying such absurdity, contradiction
   and impossibility, that it may be presumed no one ever yet had a real
   idea or conception of either.

   All things, and every event, are indeed fixed by the decree of God; but
   they are wisely, and therefore most happily contrived and adjusted, as
   has been before observed, so as to make one most wise, consistent, and
   absolutely perfect plan: And in which the freedom and moral agency of
   rational creatures are effectually secured (if this can be done by
   infinite wisdom, clothed with omnipotence; and whether this be possible
   is now to be considered) and made a necessary and essential part of the
   divine plan.

   This leads more particularly to observe, that this doctrine does not
   imply, but totally excludes a notion, which many have had of the divine
   decrees, which supposes that certain events, especially those which are
   the greatest and most important to man, are fixed and made certain,
   independent of the agency of man, and of any means whatsoever; and
   wholly unconnected with any thing of this kind; so that they will come
   to pass just as they are decreed, let man's conduct be what it may. For
   instance, they suppose that if the time of a man's death be appointed;
   he will live to that time, whatever means necessary to preserve his
   life shall be neglected, as eating and drinking, &c. and whatever may
   be done to take away his life. And if it be decreed that a particular
   person shall be saved, or he be elected to life, he shall certainly be
   saved, let him conduct as he will; and though he live and die in
   impenitence and unbelief: And if he be not elected, he must perish, let
   him do what he can, and though he sincerely seek salvation, and however
   humble, penitent and obedient he may be.--The scripture doctrine of
   God's decrees does not imply, but absolutely excludes, such an absurd
   notion and fatality as this; and makes the use of means, and agency of
   man, as important and necessary, in order to accomplish any proposed
   end, as if there were no decree respecting it: And, indeed, much more
   so: For if there were no appointed connection between means, and the
   attempts and exertions of men, and the end, then they would be of no
   importance, and have no tendency to the end; and there would not be the
   least reason or encouragement to do or attempt any thing, or use any
   means to accomplish any end whatsoever.

   It cannot with truth be said, that according to the doctrine of God's
   decrees, he who is elected to salvation, shall be saved, let him do
   what he will, and live and die in impenitence and unbelief; for there
   is no election or decree inconsistent with the declaration of Christ,
   "He that believeth not shall be damned." They who are appointed to
   salvation by the decree of God are "elected according to the
   foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit
   unto obedience." And none are appointed to destruction, whether they
   believe or not; for "he that believeth shall be saved." This is
   particularly observed here, because the true scripture doctrine is so
   generally misunderstood in this point, and consequently misrepresented;
   especially by those who do not believe this doctrine, but oppose it.

   The doctrine of God's decrees, including the means as well as the end,
   and connecting one with the other, so as to render the former important
   and necessary as the latter, as has been now stated and explained, in
   opposition to the absurd notion of fatality just mentioned, may be
   illustrated by a piece of history which we have in the Acts of the
   Apostles. [64] The apostle Paul being in a terrible storm at sea, and
   "all hope that they should be saved was taken away," had a revelation
   from heaven, that not one of them in the ship should lose his life; but
   they should all get safe to land. Upon which he stood forth, and
   declared it unto them, and his assurance that this revealed decree
   would come to pass. Thus Paul and his company were elected to be saved
   from the danger of the sea; the preservation of their lives was
   unalterably fixed, and certain. Yet, soon after this, while they were
   yet in danger, and the seamen, who only could manage the ship, were
   about to quit it, to provide for their own safety, "Paul said to the
   centurion, and to the soldiers, except these abide in the ship, ye
   cannot be saved." Here the doctrine of the fatalist above mentioned is
   contradicted, and declared not to be true; and that the decree, making
   their salvation absolutely certain, did not exclude the necessity of
   the use of means, in order to its taking place; but included this, and
   made their agency in the use of means important and necessary, there
   being a connection between these, and the end. It appears that in this
   instance, the means, and the exertions and agency of those who were to
   be saved, were as much appointed and fixed, as their salvation: and the
   latter could not come to pass without the former. And this is equally
   true of ail other instances of the purposes and decrees of God; so that
   this instance is an illustration of all others that can be mentioned,
   or that do exist. And they who separate the means from the end, and
   say, or expect, that what God has appointed will come to pass, whether
   any means are used to bring it to pass or not, do separate what God has
   joined together by infallible connection. And they assert what is not
   true, and believe and trust in a falsehood.

   And, by the way, if Paul and his companions were free moral agents in
   all they did in this affair, and which was necessary in order to their
   getting safe to land; and the declared decree respecting it, which
   fixed the whole train of actions and events that took place, w as not
   in the least inconsistent with their acting freely, but implied it; and
   they felt, and really were, as perfectly free as if there had been no
   decree in the case: Then the divine decrees, by which all events are
   made certain, cannot, in any instance, be inconsistent with the free
   moral agency of men. But no one, it is presumed, who reads this story,
   or ever has read it, thought or can think, that their freedom was taken
   from them by this decree, so as to render them no longer moral agents;
   or that it could have the least influence in rendering them in any
   degree, less free and accountable in their exercises and conduct on
   this occasion: And it would not alter the case a whit with respect to
   their freedom and moral agency, had there been no decree determining
   what should take place; and had there been no previous certainty
   whether they should be saved or perish, or how they would conduct in
   those circumstances, and at that time. Does not every one who attends
   to this story, and consults his own sense and feeling, consider them as
   exercising all desirable or possible liberty of action, and blame or
   approve of their conduct, as much as if there had been no decree
   respecting it, and the event? If so, then we have the verdict of the
   common sense and feelings of mankind in favour of the consistence of
   the doctrine of the divine decrees, with human liberty and moral
   agency. What need is there then of proceeding any farther on this
   subject?

   However, as more light may perhaps be thrown upon it by considering
   what is free moral agency, and wherein it consists; it may be of
   advantage to attend to this matter more particularly; by which it is
   hoped it may be more clearly seen, whether this moral freedom be
   consistent with the certainty of all events, which is implied in the
   doctrine of the divine decrees; and if consistent, how they are so, and
   may be perfectly reconciled.

   It has been before observed, that nothing can be determined on this
   point, without forming an idea of the liberty essential to moral
   agency, and determining what it is, and wherein it consists: For he who
   knows not what liberty is, is not in a capacity to determine what is
   consistent with it, or what is inconsistent. Men will differ on the
   question before us, as they have different notions respecting human
   liberty; and if they be agreed in this, they will agree in the decision
   of it. The question then is. What is liberty? What is that freedom
   which is essential to moral agency?

   The only way, perhaps, for any one to obtain the most satisfactory
   answer to this question, is to consult his own feelings, and inquire
   what that is: what are the exercises and exertions in which he
   supposes, yea, is certain, he acts freely, and is a moral agent. He
   will doubtless find that the internal freedom of which he is conscious,
   consisteth in his voluntary exercises, or in choosing and willing; that
   he is conscious that in all his voluntary exertions he is perfectly
   free, and must be accountable; and has no consciousness or idea of any
   other kind of moral liberty; or that the liberty he exerciseth hath any
   thing more or less belonging to it; or that it could be increased, or
   made more perfect freedom, by the addition of any thing that is not
   implied in willing and choosing. [65] He may indeed not be able to
   accomplish the thing or event which is the object of his choice; and,
   in this respect, be under restraint; but this is not inconsistent with
   his exercising perfect freedom in his choice, and in all his voluntary
   exertions, or in all he does with respect to such object or event. And
   in these exercises of will and choice his moral character does wholly
   consist; and therefore here he looks, even to his inclination and
   choice to determine what is his moral character, whether he be sinful
   or virtuous, and approves or condemns, according as he judges of the
   nature and quality of his inclination and choice; and they appear to
   him to be right or wrong, according as they are conformable or not to
   the rule or law, under which he considers himself placed.

   And where can freedom, moral agency, virtue and vice be found, if they
   consist not in voluntary exercises? Shall we look to something which
   takes place in our minds antecedent to choice and voluntary action, by
   which acts of choice are determined, and out of which they spring, and
   place liberty and virtue and sin in that? This will be to place these
   wholly in that, in which we have no concern as agents, as we are no
   more active in that which precedes our exercise of will and choice,
   than a rock or tree; or than we were in those events which took place
   ages before we were born.

   Shall liberty and moral agency be considered as consisting in what
   follows the exercise of will, or voluntary exertions, and takes place
   after the will ceases to act? There is indeed as much propriety and
   reason in placing them here, as in any thing that is antecedent to the
   exercise of will: But surely no man in his senses can imagine, that
   there is the exercise of liberty and moral action, where there is no
   liberty, choice or action, whether it be antecedent to these, or
   consequent upon them, and after they cease. When our will and choice
   are over, or we cease to will, our agency is at an end; and most
   certainly there can be no liberty exercised, when there is no exercise
   of any kind, no action.

   If voluntary action, or the exercise of will and choice, be not freedom
   and moral agency: and if all virtue and sin do not consist in this, and
   are not to be found here, even in the will and choice itself; it will
   be impossible to find them any where, or that there should be any such
   thing: And they are therefore but empty names. Every exercise of the
   will in choosing or refusing is the exercise of freedom: And it is
   impossible for man to will and choose without exercising moral liberty;
   and as impossible to exercise liberty without voluntary action, or
   exercising choice. Therefore, to say a man is not free in exercising
   will and choice, is to say he is not free in that, in which freedom
   wholly consists, and is the only possible exercise of liberty; or that
   he is not voluntary or does not choose in willing and choosing: And, it
   is no more improper and absurd to ask, whether a man is rational in
   reasoning, or to say he is not, than it is to ask, whether he is free
   in willing and choosing; or to affirm that he is not. And that because
   the exercise of freedom and the exercise of will, are convertible
   terms, and are indeed one and the same thing; as really as reasoning is
   the exercise of reason; or existence is existing. And if there be any
   such thing as moral agency, it consists in the exercise of will and
   choice, and in nothing else: and virtue and vice, praise and blame, are
   predicable of this only, and belong wholly to the exercises of will or
   voluntary action, and are as the inclination, will or choice is. [66]

   It may therefore be safely presumed, that no man, by consulting his own
   exercise and feelings, or in reasoning properly about them, ever had
   any other idea or conception of liberty, and that moral agency by which
   he is accountable for his exercises and conduct, but that which
   consists in voluntary action, or in will and choice; though many have
   confused and bewildered themselves on this point, by using words
   without any real meaning, and with mere chimeras and imaginations,
   which are perfectly inconsistent, and have no real existence.

   For instance; it has been often said, that there can be no liberty in
   man without a self determining power; and that freedom consists in
   this, even in determining his own volitions, what they shall be, Sec.

   Upon this it may be observed, that if it be meant, that man himself
   exerts his own volitions, and they are his own actions, and that he
   determines his own choice in actively willing and choosing; so that
   there can be no choice without his exertion and activity, and where he
   is wholly passive; and that, in this sense, he is the cause and author
   of his own volitions; then nothing is meant more than will be granted,
   and has been asserted above, viz. that he does act in willing and
   choosing, and is really the author, or actor of his own acts. But if by
   self determining power be meant, a power or capacity to determine,
   previous to any act of choice, what he will choose, (which must be
   their meaning, if they are not satisfied with that now expressed; and
   if that which is self contradictory can be said to have any real
   meaning) then what they mean to assert is, that in order to a man's
   being free in his choice, he must, by a foregoing act of power, exerted
   before he begins to will and choose, determine what his choice shall
   be. That is, he must act and determine, before he begins to act by
   choice; or he must make a choice before he begins to choose, and in
   order to it; which cannot be exceeded in self contradiction and
   absurdity: It being as absurd as to say, that a man can have no motion
   unless he do, previous to all his motion, move himself; that is, move
   himself before he begins to move. Or that his existence was produced by
   an exertion of his own, before he existed, putting himself into
   existence.

   Agreeable to this notion of a self determining power, and in support of
   it, it is said, that a man cannot be free in his voluntary actions,
   unless he has a freedom to either side; that is, has a freedom to
   choose or refuse, to prefer one thing, or the contrary; or has power
   and freedom to choose that, which is directly contrary to that which is
   actually the object of his choice. If by this be meant that whenever
   any one freely chooses any particular object or act, or is inclined any
   particular way, he is at liberty to prefer a contrary object or act,
   and to incline the contrary way, if he please, or wills and chooses so
   to do; this is no more than to say, that in the exercise of liberty, a
   man must choose agreeable to his choice; or has his choice; that is,
   must be voluntary: And therefore is not a contradiction to that which
   has been above asserted, viz. that liberty consists in the exercises of
   will and choice, or voluntary action.

   But if by a freedom to choose either side, be meant, that in order to
   the exercise of a free act of choice, he must, at the same time, be as
   much disposed or inclined to choose the contrary, or be no more
   inclined one way than the other; there is no need of saying any thing
   to expose the absurdity and inconsistence of this, to those who allow
   themselves to think: For it is the same as to say, that in order to a
   moral agent's choosing freely, he must really have no choice; or when
   he inclines one way, in order to be free, he must be equally inclined
   the contrary way, so as to make no preference of the one to the other.
   This assertion, thus understood, (if such an inconsistence, which
   destroys itself, can be properly said to be understood) is inconsistent
   with any possible liberty, and with all preference and choice, moral
   agency, virtue and vice, and utterly excludes all these out of the
   universe.

   They who have contended for a self-determining power, as essential to
   the freedom of moral agents; and a freedom to either side, as now
   mentioned, do hold to what they call a liberty of indifference. That in
   order to the exercise of free choice, in the time of choosing or making
   a preference, or immediately antecedent to it, there must be no
   inclination of the mind to one thing more than to another; and that
   every act of choice must arise out of a perfect indifference to either
   side, by a sovereign determining act, turning the will one certain way,
   and causing or producing an inclination, where there was none before.

   It is not needful to point out all the absurdities of such a notion; as
   supposing an exertion or act of the mind, previous to an act of will or
   choice (by which alone the mind can act) determining what the choice
   shall be; and that while the mind is perfectly indifferent, as to any
   preference or choice; and so inclination and choice must originate
   from, and rise out of that which is no inclination or choice; as its
   true cause, in order to be a free choice! And yet liberty does not
   consist in this free choice; for there is no indifference in choice;
   but it lies in that indifference to all choice or inclination, which is
   as far from choice as nonentity is from existence; and which by some
   inconceivable, impossible exertion of its own, produces inclination or
   volition, as contradictory to itself, as nothing is to something!

   These things have been observed, to confirm the truth under
   consideration, viz. that liberty, moral agency, virtue and vice, blame
   and praise worthiness, consist wholly in the exercise of will and
   choice, made in the view of motives; and in nothing else beside, or
   which is antecedent to, or consequent upon voluntary action. That this
   is the highest and most perfect liberty in nature; and no other freedom
   of moral agents can be conceived of, or is possible. That this is the
   freedom which we feel and experience, when we consider and pronounce
   ourselves free; and that of which we have an idea in others, when we
   view them as accountable for their conduct, as virtuous or vicious, and
   worthy of praise or blame, reward or punishment. [67]

   And now, from the view we have had of the doctrine of God's decrees,
   and of the nature of human liberty and moral agency, and in what they
   consist, it may be easily determined whether they are consistent with
   each other; and that their perfect consistence is demonstrably clear
   and certain. For if liberty and moral agency consist in the exercise of
   will and choice, or voluntary exertions; which is all the liberty of
   which we are, or can be conscious, can have any conception, or is
   possible, as has been shewn; then the absolute fixedness and certainty
   of all events is perfectly consistent with liberty: For though all
   events be decreed, and every motion and exercise of the will, and all
   moral actions, be determined from eternity, this is so far from
   destroying the liberty of man, that it establishes it, and makes it
   certain, viz. that he shall thus will and choose. The exercise of this
   liberty and agency is as important and necessary, as if there were no
   fixed certainty of events; and more, much more so. This liberty is
   consistent with the moral agent's absolute and universal dependence on
   God, while he acts freely and is under moral government and is
   accountable to the supreme Being, in all those exercises by which the
   events comprehended and fixed in the divine infinitely wise plan, do
   come to pass: This therefore is the only desirable as well as the only
   possible liberty. If there were, or could be any other liberty of moral
   agents, it would be infinitely dreadful! As it would be inconsistent
   with the real, absolute supremacy of the Deity, and with his perfect
   universal providence, and infinitely wise, uncontrolled government.

   Secondly, It is to be considered whether the evil, both moral and
   natural, which has taken place, and may continue without end, be really
   inconsistent with the decrees of God, foreordaining whatsoever comes to
   pass.

   It is probable that the existence of evil in God's world, and before
   our eyes, has been with many the chief, if not the only ground of
   dissatisfaction with this doctrine, and the opposition made to it. If
   no action or event had taken place, but such as appeared to men
   perfectly right, wise and good; and therefore most agreeable and
   desirable, none surely would object against God's ordaining every thing
   that was to take place, in the best manner possible. But since evil has
   actually taken place, both sin and suffering; and is like to continue
   forever, to a dreadful and amazing degree; men have been ready to think
   and say, "Surely this world had been infinitely better, more desirable
   and happy, if all evil had been effectually and forever excluded, both
   moral and natural; and nothing but perfect, eternal holiness and
   happiness had taken place. This is certainly an imperfect, disorderly,
   confused system, undesirably marred, and in a great measure ruined, by
   the rebellion of creatures against their Maker, and their consequent
   sufferings. How then is it possible that an infinitely wise, powerful
   and good God, should decree and foreordain all this? To say he has done
   it, is rather to represent him as unwise and evil, than wise and good;
   though this might be done, consistent with the freedom and moral agency
   of man."

   It is of great importance that this difficulty and objection should be
   removed, if possible; for it is not only an objection against God,
   foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass; but is equally irreconcileable
   with his supreme, uncontrolled, wise and good government of the world.
   This leads to observe,

   I. This objection does not really lie against those who hold that God
   has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, more than against those who
   do not admit this doctrine. And therefore it is far from being just, or
   agreeable to truth, to consider and represent it, as militating only,
   or in a peculiar manner, against such a doctrine. For, if the matter be
   well considered, it will appear, that the objection may be with equal
   reason and force urged against the objector himself, or those doctrines
   which he professes to believe. This difficulty, if it be one, is not
   peculiar to predestinarians, but is common to all, who believe in one
   supreme, infinitely powerful, wise and good Creator and Governor of the
   world. It has therefore been represented as the Gordian knot in
   philosophy and theology, and a question above all others unanswerable,
   Whence cometh evil? God is infinitely good; and therefore could not be
   willing or consent it should take place: But it could not take place,
   contrary to his will; for he is infinitely wise; and therefore must
   know how it might be prevented; and he is almighty, and nothing is
   impossible with him; therefore he was able to prevent it, if he had
   pleased to do it. How then is it possible that evil should take place,
   under the government of this God; while he sits at the head of the
   universe; has all things in his hand, absolutely dependent upon him,
   and rules infinitely above all control?

   This question cannot be answered, on any plan, to the satisfaction of a
   rational, inquisitive mind, or the difficulty in any measure solved,
   unless it be supposed and granted, That all the evil which does take
   place, is necessary for the greatest possible general good; and
   therefore on the whole, all things considered, wisest and best that it
   should exist just as it does.

   All who believe the divine foreknowledge, or admit that an infinitely
   perfect Being made and governs the world, must adopt this solution, and
   grant that, on the whole, it is best that evil, moral and natural,
   should take place; or be left wholly without any satisfactory solution
   at all: And indeed, they do either expressly or implicitly grant it,
   however they may differ as to the mode of explaining the matter, and
   the reasons why it is better that evil should exist, than otherwise.
   They who oppose the doctrine of the divine decrees, and yet allow that
   God could have prevented evil taking place, had he pleased to do it,
   cannot account for his not preventing it, unless they allow that he saw
   it was on the whole best, that it should not be prevented; and
   therefore it was, on the whole, best it should exist.

   And they who suppose that sin could not be prevented, if God made free
   moral agents, and continued them in the exercise of their freedom; and
   account for the introduction of evil in this way; yet must grant that,
   all things considered, it was better that there should be sin, rather
   than that there should be no moral agents; and that the system or plan
   which includes evil, is the best that was possible. For if God foresaw,
   that if he made moral agents, vast numbers of them would, in the
   exercise of their freedom, fall into sin and ruin, he would not have
   made them, and continued them in the exercise of their liberty, if it
   were not best, on the whole, that evil should take place; and if this
   was not preferable to any other possible plan; and he did not, all
   things considered, choose that evil should exist, just as it does. For
   to say that God made free moral agents, when he knew that they would
   sin, if he made them; and yet knew that it was not best, all things
   considered, that moral evil should exist; is to say, that he is neither
   wise nor good, as well as not omnipotent. This is so plain that it is
   needless to say any more to make it intelligible and evident to the
   lowest capacity.

   And the same thing, in effect, must be granted even by them who deny
   the divine foreknowledge of the actions of creatures made free. For if
   God knew that sin might possibly take place, if he made moral agents;
   and at the same time knew that it was not, all things considered, best
   that it should take place; but infinitely to the contrary, it could not
   be best to make any such creatures, and run this dreadful venture; and
   open a door for the possible introduction of this infinite evil, which
   never could be remedied: and therefore it was not consistent with
   wisdom and goodness to make them free, and continue them so, on this
   supposition. They must therefore grant that it was, in God's view, on
   the whole, better that evil should take place, and to have the world
   fall into sin and ruin, than not to create moral agents, and have no
   moral kingdom; and that he preferred such a world, and to have sinful
   miserable creatures, rather than not to create; or they must allow that
   their God was deceived, and is dreadfully disappointed, and now
   heartily wishes he had not created; or is neither wise nor good: Which
   is to have no God, or something infinitely worse! It must therefore be
   observed,

   II. It is abundantly evident and demonstrably certain from reason,
   assisted by divine revelation, that all the sin and sufferings which
   have taken place, or ever will, are necessary for the greatest good of
   the universe, and to answer the wisest and best ends; and therefore
   must be included in the best, most wise and perfect plan.

   1. This appears evident and certain from the being and perfections of
   God. God is omnipotent; his understanding is infinite, and he is
   equally wise and good. He is infinitely above all dependence and
   control; and hath done, and can and will do whatsoever pleaseth him. It
   hence is certain that he will do no thing, nor suffer any thing to be
   done or take place, which is not, on the whole, good, wisest and best,
   that it should take place, and is not most agreeable to infinite wisdom
   and goodness. It is impossible it should be otherwise. Therefore, when
   we find that sin and misery have taken place in God's world, and under
   his government, we may be as certain that it is, on the whole, best it
   should be so; and that all this evil is necessary in order to answer
   the best ends, the greatest good of the universe, as we can be, that
   there is a God, omnipotent, and possessed of infinite wisdom, rectitude
   and goodness; and he who denies or doubts of the former, equally
   questions and opposes the latter. If it be once admitted that any evil,
   or the least event may, or can take place, which is not, on the whole,
   best, and therefore not desirable that it should be, it must with equal
   reason be granted, that nothing but evil, and what is, on the whole,
   undesirable, may take place; and that the universe may become wholly
   evil, or infinitely worse than nothing: And all would be left without
   any ground or reason to trust in God, or any thing else, for the least
   good for himself, or any other being. The divine perfections and
   character are the only security against this, and are the ground of an
   equal certainty that nothing has taken place, or ever will, which is
   not on the whole best, or necessary for the greatest good of the whole.
   And this is a sure and ample foundation for the trusty confidence,
   comfort and joy of him who is a true friend to God, and desires the
   greatest good of the whole; and consequently is irreconcileably opposed
   to every event which is not, on the whole, wisest and best. If this
   foundation were taken away and destroyed, what could the righteous, the
   truly pious and benevolent do? They must be left without any possible
   support, and sink into darkness and wo!

   There can nothing take place under the care and government of an
   infinitely powerful, wise and good Being, that is not on the whole
   wisest and best; that is, for the general good; therefore, though there
   be things which are in themselves evil, even in their own nature and
   tendency, such are sin and misery; yet considered in their connection
   with the whole, and as they are necessary in the best system, to
   accomplish the greatest good, the most important and best ends, they
   are in this view, desirable, good, and not evil. And in this view,
   "There is no absolute evil in the universe." There are evils, in
   themselves considered; but considered as connected with the whole, they
   are not evil, but good. As shades are necessary in a picture, to render
   it most complete and beautiful, they are, in this view and connection,
   desirable; and the picture would be imperfect and marred, were they not
   included in it; vet considered separately, and unconnected with the
   whole, they have no beauty, but deformity, and are very disagreeable:
   So moral evil is, in itself considered, in its own nature and tendency,
   most odious, hurtful and undesirable; but in the hands of omnipotence,
   infinite wisdom and goodness, it may be introduced into the most
   perfect plan and system, and so disposed, and counteracted in its
   nature and tendency, as to be a necessary part of it, in order to
   render it most complete and desirable, [68]

   It has been said by some, that it is not becoming us, but presumption
   and arrogance, to say, that the system in which moral evil takes place
   is, on the whole, preferable to one in which it is wholly excluded; and
   is, all things considered, the best system, containing the greatest
   good. It is said, we are infinitely unable to determine this, unless we
   could comprehend the whole of each opposite system, and compare them
   together, and without error, determine the advantage of either, and see
   the good of each in their final issue, and exactly balance the account.

   The weakness, error, and impiety of such an objection, will be
   sufficiently discovered and exposed, by observing, that though man is
   infinitely unequal to this, to take a comprehensive view of all
   possible systems, and determine which would be the best, and comprehend
   the greatest possible good; and is far from seeing all the ends that
   moral evil will answer; and though he could not see how it could be the
   occasion of any good, and why a plan, in which all evil is forever
   excluded, is not infinitely preferable to that in which evil exists and
   continues forever: Yet we know that One, infinitely able to judge and
   determine in this matter, has actually chosen and fixed upon a system
   in which moral evil takes place, and preferred it to all other possible
   systems; from which known fact, we may be as certain, that it is, on
   the whole, the best possible system, containing the most real good, as
   we are, that he is omnipotent, infinitely wise and good; and to
   question the former, is equally to deny, or doubt of the latter. If God
   be infinitely perfect, wise and good, his plan of operation, and all
   his works, must be so too; and we cannot entertain the least doubt
   whether it be not, on the whole, best, and for the greatest general
   good, that evil should take place, without impeaching the divine
   character and perfections. And to say that it would have been better,
   on the whole, if sin and all the consequences of it had never taken
   place, is the same as to say, that God is neither wise nor good, or had
   not power to execute what he saw was best, and desired to do, had he
   been able. It is not necessary that it should be determined and known
   what is the greatest good; or what is the best plan to effect this,
   were it known in what it consists, in order to decide this matter. It
   is enough, that God knows and has certainly fixed upon the wisest and
   best method to accomplish it; and therefore it is certain, that in
   order to this, it is necessary that moral evil, in all its eternal
   consequences, should take place. But if the greatest possible
   manifestation and display of the divine perfections, and the highest
   possible degree of moral good and happiness in the creation, be the
   greatest good, which it certainly is, according to reason and divine
   revelation: yet a great degree of moral evil and of misery may be
   necessary, in order to produce the highest possible degree of this
   good; and therefore that system which includes this evil may contain
   the greatest good, and be infinitely preferable to any other possible
   one, in which there would be no evil. And that this is really so, we
   may be absolutely certain, since we have the infallible evidence before
   our eyes in the fact which has taken place, under the direction of
   infinite wisdom.

   It has been suggested by some, that this argument may not be
   conclusive: For though it be granted that infinite wisdom and goodness
   could not fix on a worse plan, when there was a better possible; yet
   there may be two or more possible systems equally good; and if one of
   these be fixed upon, rather than the other, we cannot hence infer that
   this is the wisest and best. Therefore, though the system in which evil
   takes place has been actually fixed upon, we do not know that a system
   might not be equally good, in which there is no evil. And then it will
   not follow that it is wisest and best, on the whole, that evil should
   exist. Upon this the following things may be observed.

   1. If two or more possible systems be supposed to be exactly alike, in
   all respects, the supposition is inconsistent, and destroys itself: For
   if there be no kind or degree of difference , there are not two or
   more, but only one. There cannot be two, where there is not, in any
   respect, the least diversity.

   2. But if there be any considerable diversity in any two or more
   possible systems, it is not to be supposed that they are, or can be,
   equally good and eligible, in the sight of infinite, unerring wisdom.
   The least difference must render one more eligible than the other. But
   if not, if two different proposed systems be equally good, and eligible
   in the view of infinite wisdom, and this were possible; then, by the
   supposition, one could not be chosen and preferred to the other; for,
   in such a case, it is supposed there is no ground of choice or
   preference: therefore no choice can be made. And if it were possible to
   choose the one and reject the other, there would be no wisdom in such a
   choice, it not being made from any reason or motive, or with any
   design. Indeed, such a supposed choice and preference is impossible,
   and therefore never did take place. It therefore could not be from
   choice, that one of two systems equally wise and good, exists, rather
   than the other, but must be from mere chance or accident, which is also
   impossible.

   3. If two or more possible systems, though different in some respects,
   might be equally good and eligible, and it were possible that one of
   these should be preferred and chosen before the other; yet it is not to
   be supposed, and it is really impossible, that two systems, so
   infinitely diverse and opposite as those must be, in one of which is
   infinite evil, and from the other all evil is excluded, should be
   equally good and eligible. The evil which has taken place in this world
   will continue forever, and in this respect is infinite; and all moral
   evil is infinite in its nature and criminality; aid the effects of this
   extend to all the views, feelings and exercises of moral agents; of all
   the subjects of God's moral government and kingdom, without end, and
   render them, in many respects, vastly different from what they would
   have been, or could be, had there been no evil. And the divine
   perfections and conduct appear in a very different light to all
   intelligences from what they would have done; and circumstances and
   events in God's eternal kingdom are, and will forever be, infinitely
   different from what would have been, if no evil had ever taken place.
   If this then be a good system, and worthy of the preference and choice
   of an infinitely wise Being, is it supposable, is it possible, that a
   system infinitely different from this, and diametrically opposite to
   it; in the great events of it; in the divine conduct; in the displays
   of the perfections of God; and in the views and exercises of all his
   subjects to all eternity, should be equally good; as well suited to
   display the divine character, and promote the holiness and happiness of
   the kingdom of God; and answer all the infinitely important and
   glorious ends, which are accomplished by the divine plan, which has
   actually taken place?

   Surely, as there is an infinite difference in two such opposite
   systems, that which has been actually chosen by infinite wisdom and
   goodness is infinitely the best; and all the evil that takes place is
   the occasion of infinitely overbalancing good, so that the former is
   wholly swallowed up by the latter; and, in this view and connection, is
   not evil, but good, being the occasion of infinitely more beauty,
   holiness, happiness and glory, in God's moral, eternal kingdom, than
   could have been in any possible system, in which evil has no place. The
   evil involves so much good, and is so absorbed in it, that, all taken
   together, and in the view of infinite wisdom, there appears the
   greatest possible beauty, perfection and glory. As shades, which appear
   deformed and disagreeable, when they stand alone, being introduced into
   a picture, by the art of a limner, add to the beauty of it, and are
   absorbed in the beauty and perfection of the whole, of which they are
   the occasion. [69]

   2, That all moral evil is designed by God to answer a good end, and is
   overruled for die greatest good, is evident from divine revelation.
   This is certain, if we can find one instance of this recorded in the
   Bible. For, if sin may be overruled for good, so that, on the whole,
   there is much more good, than could have been, had not that instance of
   sin taken place; then an infinitely wise and omnipotent Being can do it
   in every instance, and an infinitely good Being certainly will do it.
   Therefore though numberless instances of this might be produced from
   scripture history, but two or three will be mentioned, as sufficient to
   support the argument.

   The sin of Joseph's brethren, in hating him and selling him, was
   overruled by God for great good, and appears to be an important and
   necessary part of his benevolent plan to bring about the good he
   designed for Joseph himself, and the people of Israel: Therefore it is
   said God sent Joseph into Egypt, and meant to accomplish good by it.
   The sin of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, in refusing to hearken to Jehovah,
   and hardening his heart, and obstinately opposing the God of Israel,
   was designed by God for great good, and overruled to answer this end.
   The happy consequences of this instance of rebellion are too many to be
   mentioned here; and they will abide, and have influence, and a good
   effect to the end of the world; yea, to all eternity.

   It is sufficient for the present purpose to recollect what God himself
   says of this instance. "And in very deed even for this purpose have I
   raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name
   might be declared throughout all the earth: And I will get me honour
   upon Pharaoh and upon all his host." He who is sensible of the
   desirableness, worth and importance of the display of the name and
   character of Jehovah, surely will not say that the sin and ruin of
   Pharaoh was not the occasion of good, which infinitely overbalances the
   evil. And who can say that God hath not more glorified himself by the
   sin and ruin of Pharaoh, and that he is not the occasion of immensely
   more good to the church and people of God, than if he had been
   perfectly obedient? Who can say, or has any reason to believe that the
   sin and destruction of Pharaoh has not been, or will not be the
   occasion of so much good, of so great a manifestation of the divine
   character and glory, and of so much holy exercise and happiness of the
   friends of God, as his obedience, holiness and happiness would have
   been? Is it not rather certain that the contrary is true, and that to a
   degree beyond all conception? And therefore he was raised up, that by
   his sin and ruin he might, by the all directing hand of God, answer
   this infinitely important end. Had not Pharaoh existed just such an one
   as he was, and such as he is, and will be forever, the great and good
   end of which he is made the occasion, could not have been answered; and
   had not infinite wisdom seen that such a character as that of Pharaoh
   was necessary in order to the greatest good of the whole, it would not
   have had an existence.

   We have another instance of this kind in the condemnation, sufferings,
   and death of the Lord of glory. This is an instance of sin, the most
   aggravated and criminal, doubtless, of any other that has ever taken
   place. And yet all this sin and suffering was foreordained, and
   actually took place, by the wise counsel and decree of God, because it
   was absolutely necessary in order to accomplish the most benevolent
   purposes of Heaven, and produce the highest good of the universe. In
   order to this, it was necessary that Christ should die on the cross;
   but this could not be, unless he died by the hands of sinful men. Had
   he not been thus put to death, there would have been no redemption of
   man, nor any of that remarkable, glorious display of the divine
   character, which is exhibited in this work. It was most certainly
   desirable, and of infinite importance, that all the sin should take
   place which was necessary in order to bring to pass this event, the
   suffering and death of Christ, which though infinitely evil, in itself
   considered, is of most happy and glorious consequence. All this sin and
   evil sinks into nothing, when compared with the good, the glory that
   follows; and the whole appears to be an infinite good; the evil being
   covered, and vanishing, in the splendour and glory occasioned by it,
   and with which it is connected. Better, infinitely better is it, that
   the Jews should commit that sin, and that Christ should thus suffer,
   than that the infinitely good and glorious consequences should not take
   place. And may it not with safety and the greatest assurance be added,
   it is better that all the sin and misery that ever has been, or will
   be, should take place, than that there should not be such a character
   as that of the Mediator; such works as he has done and will do; such
   manifestation s of the divine character, as he has made and will make;
   such happiness and glory; which will be the eternal consequence of
   redemption? But to return.

   If the sin of putting the Son of God to death was the occasion of the
   greatest good, which could not otherwise have taken place; and
   therefore God ordained that this should come to pass, for the sake of
   the infinitely overbalancing good J and brought it about, consistent
   with the freedom of man, and his own hatred of that sin, in itself
   considered, and the total inexcusableness and infinite ill desert of
   those sinners; then here is an instance of the most horrid wickedness,
   which is necessary to promote and bring about the greatest good; and,
   in this view, very desirable, and of infinite importance that it should
   take place. And it may be hence safely concluded, that every instance
   of evil that ever has been, or will be, is as really necessary to
   promote the greatest possible good; and, in this view, a desirable
   event; and therefore determined by the infinitely wise counsel and
   decree of Heaven, however undesirable, odious or detestable it may be,
   in itself considered.

   But that all the sins of men are overruled by God for good, and are
   appointed to take place for this end, may not only be inferred from the
   instances mentioned, and from many others; but it is expressly asserted
   in the following words of Sacred Writ, "Surely the wrath of man shall
   praise thee: The remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain." If by the
   wrath of man, here be meant the furious exertions of sinners in their
   opposition to God and their neighbour, this comprehends all the sins of
   men, as they are all of the same nature. It is here declared as a most
   certain truth, that these sins of men, however numerous, and though
   they rise ever so high, shall turn to the praise of God, and promote
   his declarative glory. God will so overrule the sin of man, that he
   will get honour thereby: And that sin which would not answer this good
   and infinitely important end, he will not suffer to take place; but
   will effectually prevent it.--The following things are clearly
   contained in this passage,

   1. That God does superintend and direct with regard to every instance
   of sin: He orders how much sin there shall be, and effectually
   restrains and prevents all that which he would not have take place. Men
   are, with respect to this, absolutely under his direction and control.

   2. That all the sin which does take place shall answer the best and
   most important end; even that for which all things were made, the glory
   of God. "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee."

   3. That therefore God wills and orders it to take place, that he may
   answer this end by it. If he effectually restrains and prevents that
   which will not praise him; it is certain that he could prevent all sin,
   if he pleased, and that he would do it, were it not necessary to answer
   this end; and that he wills the existence of it. not for its own sake,
   but for the sake of the end to be answered by it; or the good of which
   it is to be the occasion.

   4. From this it follows, that the sin of man is the means of a good
   which so far overbalances the evil of sin, and all the evil
   consequences of it, that it is desirable, on this account, that it
   should take place: Therefore there is more good in the universe, and
   this is a better world, than could possibly have existed, had no evil
   come into it; and every instance of sin and evil is conducive, and
   necessary to the greatest possible good of the whole.

   5. All this is here asserted in the strongest terms as a most certain
   and important, pleasing truth. The evidence and certainty of it are as
   clear and great, as of the existence of an almighty, wise and good
   Creator and Governor of the world. And it is a truth of the highest
   importance to be known, and believed with the greatest assurance, as it
   is implied in the exercises of true piety, especially in a joyful
   acquiescence in the divine government; joy in the supremacy and
   infinite felicity of God, and implicit cheerful trust in him: And as it
   is necessary to the support and comfort of the friends of God, in all
   the darkness and evil in this world; and the only proper ground of
   their rejoicing that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; and that their
   God is in the heavens, and hath done whatsoever he pleased.

   Thus it appears demonstrably certain, both from the being and
   perfections of God, and from divine revelation, that all the evil which
   takes place in God's world, and under the influence of his government,
   is necessary in order to the greatest possible good; and is made the
   means of this; so that in this view, it is desirable, and perfectly
   agreeable to infinite wisdom and goodness, that it should take place
   just as it does. Therefore God, infinitely wise and good, has
   determined and decreed that evil should exist, as necessary to the
   highest perfection, beauty, happiness and glory of the system which was
   to be formed by his hand. Consequently, the evil which does actually
   take place, does not afford the least ground of objection against the
   doctrine of God's decrees, by which he has foreordained whatsoever
   comes to pass; but is perfectly reconcileable to this doctrine: And
   this truth is the great support and ground of comfort to the truly
   pious mind, in the view of the abounding evil with which this world has
   been so long filled. God has foreordained all this, and all that ever
   will take place, for his own glory, and the greatest good of the
   universe: He superintends the whole, and brings good out of all this
   evil, infinitely greater good than could have been, without the evil.
   Therefore all is perfectly agreeable to the dictates of infinite wisdom
   and goodness.

   It is certain that evil, both moral and natural, is in itself
   undesirable, and must be considered as infinitely contrary to divine
   holiness and goodness, viewed in this light only; and could not
   possibly have place in a system formed by God, and absolutely under his
   direction and government, were it not necessary in order to the
   greatest good of the whole, to make the system in the highest degree
   perfect, happy and glorious: And, in this view and connection, the
   existence of evil is desirable, and must be introduced, if infinite
   wisdom and goodness dictate and govern. And all the children of wisdom
   will approve and rejoice. And very unhappy are they who are
   dissatisfied with die works and ways of God in the moral or natural
   world; and think they have wisdom enough to see many things defective
   and wrong; and to have ordered matters better, had they been to
   contrive and direct them. This seems to be the situation of those who
   make the objection under consideration; which, it is presumed, will
   appear to all who well consider what has now been said in answer to it,
   to be altogether groundless and unreasonable. [70]

   Thirdly, It is now to be considered, whether God's foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass, does imply that he is the origin, cause and
   author of sin, in a sense which is contrary to infinite holiness, and
   therefore very dishonourable to him. This is confidently asserted by
   many; and they have on this ground exclaimed against this doctrine, and
   all that is implied in it; and represented it in a most shocking and
   horrible light. Therefore, though what has been said of the nature of
   sin, as consisting wholly in the disposition and will of the sinner,
   and of the good of which it is the occasion, which renders it desirable
   that it should take place, may serve to throw some light on this point,
   and show that God's choosing and determining that sin should take
   place, as necessary to accomplish the greatest good, is a wise and holy
   choice: Yet it may be proper and important more particularly to
   consider this subject, and attend to it in the light in which it is set
   by the objection which has been introduced, and is now under
   consideration.

   We ought to attend to this point, and think and speak of it with care
   and caution, and in the exercise of fear and reverence of the
   infinitely great and holy God, lest, under the notion of thinking and
   speaking for him, and to his honour, our thoughts and words should be
   really against him, and tend to his reproach. And this caution and
   reverential fear ought to possess the minds of those who make the
   objection under consideration, as well as of those who believe and
   assert the doctrine against which the objection is made. For if indeed
   God has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass; then all objections
   against it, however plausible they may appear, are really replying
   against God, and very dishonourable and displeasing to him. But if, on
   the other hand, the objection be reasonable and well founded, they who
   believe the doctrine of God's decrees, do really dishonour and
   displease him. We are happy that we have a revelation from God, in
   which this point, as well as every important one, is set in a clear and
   easy light; so that no man can, with this in his hand, run into an
   error concerning it, and be blameless. In the light of reason, and this
   revelation, let the following things be well considered.

   I. It is of importance to observe here, and fix it as certain, that
   when the origin or cause of evil is inquired after, or is ascribed to
   God, or any other being; the moral evil itself is not meant by the
   origin or cause of it. The origin or cause of any thing is necessarily
   before the thing which is the effect, and must exist and take place
   antecedent to the evil, and before the evil can exist. It is therefore
   certain that there can be no moral evil in the origin or cause of this
   evil, in whatever and wherever it may be found: For to suppose the
   contrary, is a direct and plain contradiction. Moral evil cannot be the
   origin or cause of moral evil, any more than any effect can be the
   cause of itself, or a child be the cause of his father. We, in
   considering what is the origin of moral evil, are going back to
   something which is antecedent to the evil, and where, or in which, no
   such evil does, or can be supposed to exist, to find the cause of moral
   evil, or a reason why it does take place, rather than not. We must go
   back, therefore, till we get to that in which there is no moral evil,
   before we arrive to, or can find that which is the origin or cause of
   it. If we find an existence, object or exertion, in which there is
   moral evil, we may be sure, we have not yet found, or arrived to the
   origin and cause of it; and must yet go a step farther back, even to
   that in which there is no moral evil, in order to find the origin of
   this evil.

   It hence follows that if man, or any creature is, in any instance, the
   origin or cause of sin, (meaning by cause, that which is antecedent to
   the existence of sin, and of which sin is properly the effect) that man
   or creature cannot be the sinful cause of that sin: And there is no
   moral evil in any conceptions, thoughts or exertions of such a
   creature, which are necessary to take place, antecedent to the
   existence of sin, and in order to it, whatever they may be, or if any
   be necessary.

   It is also certain that if God, the first cause of all things, be the
   origin or cause of moral evil; (and this can be proved, and may be
   asserted, as a most evident truth,) this is so far from imputing moral
   evil to him, or supposing that there is any thing of that nature in
   him, that it necessarily supposes the contrary; and that in being the
   first cause of moral evil, there is no sin; and therefore that he may
   be the origin or cause of it, consistently with infinite holiness, and
   exercise it in whatever exertions or influence may be necessary or
   implied in being thus the cause of sin.

   If any should say or imagine, that the thought, exertion, or influence,
   which tends to produce sin, and is in fact the cause or origin of it,
   must be itself sinful or wrong; this is only to contradict himself, and
   say that such exercise or exertion is not the origin of sin, but sin
   itself; consequently, as has been observed, we must go farther back to
   find the origin of this sin, till we find something in which there is
   no sin. And, according to this notion, we must go back without end, and
   never find the origin of sin, unless sin itself be the origin and cause
   of all sin; which is a contradiction. It therefore still appears
   demonstrably certain, that if there be any origin or cause of moral
   evil, which is supposed by all those who inquire after it, there is no
   moral evil, nothing morally wrong in this cause, wherever it may be
   found, and whatever it may be. Therefore God, in foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass, may be, in this sense, the origin and cause
   of sin, consistent with infinite holiness; and the contrary cannot be
   supposed without a contradiction.

   If it should be said, "There is no origin or cause of moral evil except
   what is in the evil itself: It is the cause of itself, so far as it has
   any cause: Therefore the question concerning the origin of sin, meaning
   something antecedent to it, is groundless and vain, there being no such
   thing in nature. Moral evil has no cause, in this sense of cause." Upon
   this it may be observed,

   1. If this be admitted, then the objection under consideration, against
   the divine decrees, foreordaining all actions and events, as making God
   the origin, cause or author of sin, falls to the ground, and is given
   up: For, according to this, sin has no cause out of itself, or previous
   to its existence. But this cannot be admitted , for,

   2. If moral evil may exist without a cause, there being no thing
   antecedent to its actual existence, which had any more influence or
   tendency to the existence of sin, than to the contrary; and there was
   no ground or reason of its existence, or why it should be, rather than
   not be, antecedent to its actually taking place; then there is an end
   of arguing from any effect whatever, to a cause; and we have not the
   least evidence that We ourselves, or any thing around us, or the world,
   have any origin or cause. For if moral evil may exist without a cause,
   so may every thing else which comes under our notice; and we have not
   the least evidence that there is a God, as the cause of the things
   which we behold. Which is not only directly contrary to the assertion
   of St. Paul, but to the reason and common sense of mankind in general.
   And why should one choose to embrace such an absurdity, and assert that
   sin has no origin or cause, antecedent to its actual existence, and is
   the cause of itself, rather than to admit that God is the origin of it;
   since by admitting this, it is not supposed there is any moral evil in
   him; but the contrary is necessarily implied, as has been observed
   above?

   It will, perhaps, be farther said, "It is not meant that sin has no
   cause whatsoever in any sense; but that it has no positive cause: It
   has a negative cause; and God may be the cause, in this sense, that is,
   he permitted moral evil to take place, by determining not to prevent
   the existence of it, when he had power to prevent it, had he been
   pleased to do it."--Upon this the following remarks may be made.

   1. If God could prevent every sin that is committed, and yet has
   determined to permit all that takes place, which renders the event
   certain; then his determining to permit it, is really decreeing that it
   shall take place; or foreordaining that it shall come to pass: So that
   the objection that God's foreordaining sin, makes him the cause and
   author of it, is not the least obviated by this supposition or scheme.
   And it may be worth while to consider whether any other supposed
   difficulty is removed by this. This leads to observe,

   2. This does not in the least obviate what has been just observed upon
   the assertion that sin has no cause: For a negative cause is really no
   cause. Therefore to say concerning any existence, It has no cause but a
   negative one, is really denying that it has any cause. This therefore
   makes sin to exist without a cause or reason of its existence, rather
   than of its nonexistence. If the world has only a negative cause of its
   existence, then there is no cause of its existence, and no reason can
   be given why it does exist.

   Moreover, this notion of a negative cause of moral evil supposes some
   positive cause, by which sin would come into existence; a cause of
   sufficient force, and positive energy to produce this effect, unless
   the operation of it be counteracted by God, by preventing the existence
   of it, by a positive energy; and therefore it has actual existence, as
   an effect of this cause, by the determination of God not to hinder it.
   If an effect will certainly take place upon a mere permission, or not
   preventing it, it is necessarily supposed there is a cause sufficient
   to produce this effect, if not counteracted. And it must be now asked,
   what is this cause? Does it exist in God, or in the creature? If in the
   creature, from whence is the origin of this positive cause? Is its
   origin in itself; or in the creature? Or must we go back to the first
   cause? If either of the former be admitted, then we are again involved
   in the absurdity of sin being the cause of itself; or of a cause and
   effect existing independent of the first cause.

   3. Even this supposition, that God is only the negative cause of moral
   evil, were it consistent, and did not leave sin really without any
   cause; yet relieves no difficulty respecting the existence of sin. It
   will be asked, why God suffered sin to exist, when he could have
   prevented it? If we could account for its existence without any reason
   or cause of it, if permitted or suffered to exist, that is, if not
   prevented; how shall we account for God's suffering it to exist? It is
   presumed all must agree in the following answer. Because He, on the
   whole, all things considered, saw it best, or chose it should exist,
   rather than not. And if so, he must, he certainly did, choose things
   should be ordered so ns to make its existence absolutely certain; and
   consequently did order them so, and did every thing that was necessary
   to be done, previous to the existence of sin, in order to render the
   existence of it certain. Indeed, if it be granted that God, on the
   whole, chose moral evil should exist (which all must grant, who allow
   that he has permitted sin) and that this is a wise and holy choice;
   such a choice implies his doing every thing that is necessary in order
   to render this choice effectual; and that God is wise and holy in
   willing or doing all this, whatever it may be. And all this is really
   nothing more than his choice or will that it should exist; as all that
   God did in creating the world, so far as we can conceive, was to will
   its existence, or say. Let it be; there being a certain connection
   between his willing the existence of any thing or event, and the actual
   existence of it. He is in no other sense the origin or cause of any
   thing. And in this sense, it is granted by all who allow he permitted
   it, that he is the origin of moral evil.

   Some may, perhaps, think all which has been now said of the origin or
   cause of moral evil may be evaded, and proved to be nothing to the
   purpose, by observing, that sin is purely a negative thing; that it is
   so, at least, in its original and foundation; and therefore has no
   origin or cause; or, at most, can have nothing more than a negative
   one.

   On this it may be observed, that if it be meant that sin is a
   nonentity, and has, properly and in truth, no existence, and therefore
   is really nothing; and if this can be proved, then certainly a negative
   cause, or, which is the same, no cause, is quite sufficient in this
   case, to account for that which is not an effect, and is really
   nothing: And the inquiry, and all assertions about origin, cause or
   effect, are nugatory and absurd.

   But will any man say, or can he believe, that there is nothing positive
   in moral evil, and that it has no positive existence? If such an one
   can be found, he must, if he will be consistent, say and believe that
   it is nothing or that there is no such thing; for not positively to
   exist is non-existence; and what is this more than nothing? And why is
   not moral good or holiness a negative, or nonentity also? Reason and
   divine revelation join to assert both to have a real, positive
   existence. Is there not as real, positive existence and exertion in
   selfishness, or self love, as in benevolence, or love to God? Or in
   enmity against God, as in the highest exercise of friendship to him?

   But may it not be urged, that it is indeed granted that sin has
   something positive in it, when it comes to actual exercise, and is
   exerted in opposition to God and man: But is not this consistent with
   its having a negative original, or arising from a privative cause?

   Answer. If there could be sin where there is not, in any sense, the
   least exercise, which it will be difficult, if not impossible to prove;
   still this must be nothing, if a mere negative or privation; and can
   have no existence. And a privative cause is no cause. But granting that
   a negative or privative cause is a real cause, and that a negative
   effect, is a reality; yet, this does not account for this negative
   becoming a positive existence of its own accord, without any positive
   cause. If that which is merely negative, were any such existence
   possible, may start into positive existence, without any positive
   cause; then the whole world might come into existence without any
   positive exertion or cause. This supposition therefore does not appear
   to help the matter in the least, or to remove any difficulty.

   But it may still be asked, is not the true and only origin of sin
   overlooked in all that has been yet said? Is not the sinner himself the
   only true and proper cause of his sin, as he produces it, and there is
   no other cause or author of his sinful exertions?

   Answer. If in this question it be meant, that he with whom moral evil
   is found is the sinner, and that we must not look beyond him, or out of
   him, to find the sin of which he is guilty; but that he is, in this
   sense, the origin, cause and author of all the sin that is found with
   him; it being his own act, which he has exerted voluntarily, and
   without any compulsion; and for which he only is blameable: If this be
   the meaning, it is granted the sinner is, in this sense, the sole cause
   and author of all the sin found with him; and we are not to look any
   farther for it. But still there is a reason why things were so ordered
   and disposed, as that he should thus sin, rather than not. Something
   must have taken place previous to his sin, and in which the sinner had
   no hand, with which his sin was so connected, as to render it certain
   that sin would take place just as it does. This is the origin or cause
   of sin, which the question we are upon respects, and concerning which
   inquiry is made: And in which it has been observed, there can be no
   sin, as by the supposition it takes place and is exerted before the
   existence of moral evil, of which it is the origin or cause, and in
   order to it. Therefore, if we find that the great first cause of all
   things is, in this sense, the origin of moral evil, by foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass, this does not suppose any moral evil in him,
   but the contrary; and is perfectly consistent with his infinite
   holiness, as has been before observed.

   Objection. But after all the above reasoning about the origin of sin,
   which seems to prove that the first cause of all things is in a true
   and important sense, the cause of this evil; he having foreordained
   that it should take place, and disposed and done every thing that was
   necessary to be done, antecedent to the existence of sin, and in order
   to it, by which this event was made certain; and that in all this there
   can be no moral evil, but the contrary: Yet it will appear to the
   common sense and feelings of men, that to will the existence of sin,
   and to make any exertion or do any thing in order to it, in consequence
   of which it does actually exist, is wrong and sinful; and therefore
   infinitely unbecoming the supreme and infinitely holy Being. And to
   assert any such thing, or even to suppose that God is, in any sense,
   the origin of sin, is shocking, and fraught with impiety!

   Ans. 1. It may be that many under the gospel, by not attending candidly
   and without prejudice to this subject, and not thinking closely upon
   it, nor making proper distinctions; and by habituating themselves to a
   wrong association of ideas on this point; may be shocked at the above
   representation; and feel as if it carried in it a degree of blasphemy;
   and yet, this not be any evidence that it is not agreeable to the
   truth, and consistent with the highest degree of real piety, and
   veneration for the Most High; and even the proper dictate and language
   of it.

   The Jews had, by education, and otherwise, imbibed such prejudices in
   favour of their temple and worship, and had habitually formed such an
   association of ideas, that they thought and felt that Stephen was
   guilty of blasphemy, when be intimated, that their place of worship
   should be destroyed, and the customs which Moses delivered to them be
   changed. And they were shocked, and stopped their ears, when he told
   them that he saw the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the
   right hand of God. And when Christ said to the Jewish council,
   "Hereafter ye shall seethe Son of Man on the right hand of power, and
   coming in the clouds of heaven," the high priest was so shocked, that
   he rent his clothes, and they all cried out, blasphemy! The present
   Jews, and those of many generations past, have thought it a piece of
   high impiety to pronounce the Tetragrammaton, as it is called; that is,
   the sacred name Jehovah, and shudder at the thought of doing it; and
   are to the last degree shocked to hear it done. This is the effect of a
   false association of ideas, and superstition, introduced by the force
   of education, by which it comes to pass, that the pronunciation of a
   name, which was spoken freely, and with the highest exercise of pious
   veneration of the Deity, by the prophets and holy men of old, is now
   considered by the Jews as an instance of shocking impiety.

   If we look into the popish world, we shall find innumerable instances
   of this kind. If a protestant pay no veneration to the host, and refuse
   to bow, and worship the breaden god, when it is carried in public
   procession, the populace will be shocked with a degree of horror: and
   it will be no wonder if he gets a broken head for his impiety. And if
   he do not worship and pray to the virgin Mary, and venerate her image;
   but speaks against it as idolatry, their pious feelings are most
   sensibly excited, and they abhor the impious wretch; while he considers
   himself to be following the dictates of true piety in all this, and
   honouring the Most High.

   From these and many other instances of the same kind, it appears, that
   what is sometimes called the common sense and feelings of men, is not
   to be depended upon, in determining what is true or false; especially
   in those things which respect the Deity: And more especially, when the
   dictates of this sense and feeling are contrary to the most clear
   dictates of sober, sound reason, and to the plain and abundant
   declarations of divine revelation. For as that which is often highly
   esteemed among men, is an abomination in the sight of God; so that
   which is most important truth, in his sight, and honourable to Him, is
   in too many instances an abomination to men. This leads to,

   Ans. 2. That God did will the existence of moral evil, in determining,
   at least, to permit it, when he could have prevented it, had he been
   pleased to do it, must be granted by all who would avoid ascribing to
   Him that imperfection, impotence, and subjection to that power, be it
   what it may, which introduced sin, contrary to his will; which is
   indeed shockingly impious, and real blasphemy, to every considerate,
   and rationally pious mind. We may inter from this, with the greatest
   certainty, that it is, all things considered, or in the view of the
   omniscient God, wisest and best that moral evil should exist. For to
   suppose that it was his m ill that it should take place, or that he has
   permitted it, when he could have prevented it; and yet that it was not
   wisest and best in his sight, that it should exist, is beyond
   expression impious, and at once strips the Deity of all moral good or
   holiness; and gives him the most odious and horrid character!

   But if God did will and choose that sin should exist, this being, on
   the whole, most agreeable to his holiness or his infinite wisdom and
   goodness; this necessarily implies, as has been before observed, ail
   that energy, exertion and disposal of things, that is necessary,
   previous to the existence of sin, in order to its actually taking
   place; and without which it could not have existed. For there is an
   infallible connection between the will of God that sin shall exist, and
   the actual existence of it; and this will of God is the cause or reason
   why it has taken place, rather than not. And if it be wise and holy to
   will and determine the existence of moral evil, it is wise and holy to
   order and do every thing which must be ordered and done, antecedent to
   its existence, in order to its taking place, be that what it may: And
   not to order, dispose and do all that, would be contrary to wisdom and
   holiness. Therefore, to assert that God is, in this sense, and so far
   the origin and cause of sin, is so far from imputing any thing
   dishonourable to him, that it is the only way in which his infinite
   wisdom and holiness can be consistently asserted and maintained: and to
   assert the contrary is highly impious, and very opposite to the sense
   and feelings of the pious mind of him who is truly judicious, sensible
   and discerning.

   The sum of what has been said on this point may be expressed in the
   following words. Moral evil could not exist, unless it were the will of
   God, and his choice, that it should exist, rather than not. And from
   this it is certain, that it is wisest and best, in his view, that sin
   should exist. And in thus willing what was wisest and best, and
   foreordaining that it should come to pass, God exercised his wisdom and
   goodness; and in this view and sense, is really the origin and cause of
   moral evil; as really as he is of the existence of any thing which he
   wills; however inconceivable the mode and manner of the origin and
   existence of this event may be; and however different from that of any
   other. [71]

   II. Divine Revelation must be examined carefully to find in what light
   this point is there represented; whether it does warrant any to say,
   God has foreordained the existence of sin: Or that he is in any sense
   the origin and cause of it. This ought to be done with fear and
   reverence of these sacred oracles; with impartial, upright hearts, and
   a religious concern and desire to think and speak according to this
   word, since they who do not "have no light in them."

   In order to obtain the light which is contained in the holy scriptures,
   respecting this subject, it may be of advantage to observe the
   following particulars.

   1. According to divine revelation, God superintends, orders and directs
   in all the actions of men, and in every instance of sin; so that his
   hand and agency is to be seen and acknowledged in men's sinful actions,
   and the events depending on them, as really and as much, as in any
   events and actions whatever. Of this every person must be sensible, who
   has read the Bible with any proper attention and true understanding; as
   it is held up to view throughout the whole of it, and is suited to
   impress this idea on the mind of every one who reads it. All the
   historic part of the Bible, and the predictions of events, whether
   great or less, to be accomplished by the wicked agency of man; and of
   innumerable particular sinful actions of men, are an incontestible
   evidence of this. So are all the acknowledgments of the divine hand and
   agency, in the events brought to pass by the sinful conduct of men;
   which are too many to be particularly mentioned here. But the truth of
   this observation may perhaps be more fully illustrated, and set in a
   stronger point of light, by attending to the following passages of
   scripture.

   The very sinful deed of the brethren of Joseph, in selling him, which
   was the necessary mean of his going into Egypt, is represented as so
   ordered by God, as to be as really done by him, as if it had not been
   done by the hands and agency of these wicked men. Joseph says to his
   brethren, that God did it, and that he had a particular and good design
   in it. "God sent me before you, to preserve you a posterity in the
   earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not
   you that sent me hither, but God, who meant it unto good." [72] "He
   sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant." [73]

   It is said, concerning Eli's wicked sons, that "they hearkened not unto
   the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them." [74] It
   is here asserted that by God's ordering and direction, they disregarded
   the admonition of their father, as necessary in order to his destroying
   them.

   When Shimei cursed David, he acknowledges the hand of God in it, as
   much as if Shimei had done it in obedience to the divine command, or it
   had been done immediately by God himself. "So let him curse, because
   the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Let him alone, and let him
   curse; for the Lord hath bidden him." [75] It is impossible David
   should express himself thus on this occasion, unless he viewed Shimei's
   wicked conduct to be ordered and directed by God, so that his hand was
   to be seen in it, as, in this sense, the origin and cause of what took
   place.

   "And Absalom and all the men of Israel said. The counsel of Hushai the
   Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel: For the Lord hath
   appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that
   the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom." [76] This good counsel of
   Ahithophel was defeated by the folly of Absalom and the men of Israel;
   yet it is said, God had appointed it, to bring about his own purpose.
   His hand guided the whole affair, and superintended every motion of the
   hearts of those wicked men.

   "Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
   from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake
   by Ahijah the Shilonite, unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. Thus saith the
   Lord, Return every man to his house; for this thing is from me." [77]
   Here it is said, that God so superintended and directed in this affair,
   that he was the cause of that foolish and wicked conduct of Rehoboam;
   and that it was from him, as necessary to accomplish an important
   event, which he had determined and foretold. And who can say, that God
   is not, in the same sense, and as much, the origin and cause of every
   instance of sin, that he may accomplish his infinitely wise designs? Is
   not this passage alone a sufficient warrant for this? And if the divine
   character can be vindicated, in what is ascribed to him, in this
   instance, how can it be dishonourable to him to say, he so directs and
   orders with respect to every instance of sin, as that he is, in this
   sense, the origin and cause of it? When the enemies of Judah came to
   ravage and destroy that people and country, it is said, God sent them.
   "And the Lord sent against Jehoiakim bands of the Chaldees, and bands
   of the Syrians, &c. and sent them against Judah to destroy it. Surely
   at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove them out
   of his sight." What can be the meaning of this, unless it be that God
   superintended, ordered and directed all the motions and conduct of
   these wicked men: and so made them his instruments to destroy Judah?
   "Through the anger of the Lord, it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
   until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled
   against the king of Babylon," [78] Is it not here declared that God
   ordered the sinful rebellion of Zedekiah against the king of Babylon;
   and that his hand or agency was to be seen, and his anger with the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah, was expressed in this?

   "But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver
   them into the hand of their enemies." [79] It appears from the story
   that it was owing to the pride and folly of Amaziah, that he did not
   hearken to the admonition and advice of the king of Israel; and yet
   this was of the Lord. By his determination, direction and
   superintending influence, it came to pass, in order to answer his own
   wise purposes: and his hand was to be seen in the obstinacy of Amaziah,
   as really as in any event which takes place by the immediate exertion
   of divine energy. And if this instance of sin was of God, then every
   instance may be, and most certainly is so: And we are warranted to
   assert this, by the declaration before us, as well as many others of
   the same tenor to be found in holy writ.

   In the tenth chapter of Isaiah, God, by his prophet, addresses the king
   of Assyria, as the rod of his anger, and the executioner of his
   indignation, against the hypocritical nation of Judah and Israel; and
   says he would send him to punish them; though he in going and doing die
   work, would have no design or desire to accomplish the ends God
   intended to answer by his pride and cruelty; And therefore after he had
   accomplished his ends by him, he would punish him for that wickedness
   of which he would be guilty, and which was necessary to fulfil the
   purposes of God: And while he was as really an instrument in the hand
   of God, and as much under his influence and direction, and as dependent
   on him, in all his motions, as is the ax or saw, in the hand of the
   workman. There is no need of any comment to show that this passage
   represents God as ordering, directing and bounding the sinful actions
   of wicked men; so that they are answering his ends in what they do, and
   his hand is to be seen and acknowledged in their sinful motions and
   actions, as really as the hand and exertions of the workman is to be
   seen in the motion of the axe or saw, by which he executes his designs.

   In the same manner God speaks of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He
   says, he would send and fecht him, and the nations under his command;
   and by him utterly destroy Judah, and the neighbouring nations; and
   speaks of him as his instrument, or weapon in his hands to lay waste
   and destroy. "Thou art my battleaxe and weapons of war. For with thee
   will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
   kingdoms, &c." [80]

   To the same purpose are the following words, "Behold, I have created
   the smith that blow eth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth
   an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy."
   [81] This is said to support and comfort the people of God, in all
   their dangers and troubles from evil men, telling them that they had no
   reason to be afraid of them, since they were made by him, to answer his
   ends; and they were absolutely in his hands: so that they should do
   nothing but what he ordered; and therefore could do them no real hurt.

   "And before these days, there was no hire for man, nor any hire for
   beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out, or came in,
   because of the affliction; for I set all men every one against his
   neighbour." [82] This warrants us to consider God's hand, and
   efficacious influence, in all the hatred, quarrels and wars that take
   place among men.

   "Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments
   whereby they should not live. And I polluted them in their own gifts,
   in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb,
   that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I
   am the Lord." This has reference to the statutes and judgments which
   they made for themselves, and practised in their abominable idolatries,
   &c. yet God says, He gave them these evil and destructive statutes and
   judgments; and He polluted them, in these abominable sacrifices, by
   which they polluted themselves. This strongly expresses his
   superintendency and agency in all this, in order to answer a wise and
   important end. [83]

   The crucifixion of our Saviour, and all the circumstances that attended
   it, are expressly and repeatedly declared to have taken place, in
   consequence of the divine determination and decree, foreordaining them;
   and by his direction and superintending hand. It was so important and
   useful, that this whole affair should be viewed in this light, that
   special care was taken to keep it in view. "Thinkest thou that I cannot
   now pray to my father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve
   legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that
   thus it must be?" "But all this was done, that the scriptures of the
   prophets might be fulfilled." [84] "But behold the hand of him that
   betrayeth me, is with me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth
   as it was determined." [85] "Him, being delivered by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands
   have crucified and slain. And now, brethren, I know that through
   ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. But those things which
   God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ
   should suffer, he hath so fulfilled." [86]

   Peter, in these passages, is careful to observe, that the death of
   Christ was part of the divine plan, which he had in his wise counsel
   determined; and had particularly foretold by the prophets; and which he
   had now fulfilled by their wicked hands, as it was necessary to be
   viewed in this light, in order to understand it, and see the reason and
   importance of this memorable event; And not consider it is an argument
   of the weakness and disappointment of the Saviour and his followers.
   Accordingly the disciples kept this constantly in view, and say, in a
   solemn address to God, "For, of a truth, against thy holy child Jesus,
   whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together, to do
   whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. [87]
   "

   If God had before determined, or foreordained, that all this should be
   done, with every act of sin which was necessarily implied in its being
   done; and his irresistible hand and operation was to be seen and
   regarded in all this; and the church did see and particularly attend to
   this, as matter of support, thankfulness and joy; and devoutly
   acknowledged all this, in a solemn address to God, in order to glorify
   him; all which must be owned to be true, as long as this passage is
   allowed to stand in the Bible: Then there can be no impiety, in
   believing and saying, that God has foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass, and with his hand is executing his own wise purposes, in his
   governing providence, ordering and directing all the actions of men,
   even the most sinful, as well as others, for his own glory and the
   general good; and that his hand is to be seen in every event, and in
   every action of man, as really as if he was the only agent in the
   universe; yea, to view things in this light, and to have feelings and
   exercises answerable, is for the glory of God, is suited to support and
   comfort all his friends; and is implied in true devotion.

   2. The holy scriptures represent God as, in some way or other, moving,
   exciting and stirring men up to do that which is sinful, and which, in
   itself considered, and as done by them, is very displeasing to him.

   "And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he
   moved David against them, to say, Go number Israel and Judah." [88]
   This, to which God is said to move David, was a great sin in him, and
   very displeasing to God. "And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto
   Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. And God stirred him up another adversary,
   Rezon, the son of Eliada." [89] "And the God of Israel stirred up the
   spirit of Pul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser, and
   he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and Gadites, and brought
   them unto Halah, &:c." [90] "Behold, I will stir up the Medes against
   them, which shall not regard silver, &c." [91] These passages express a
   divine agency, either mediate or immediate, on the minds of these
   persons, by which they were influenced and moved to those actions; and
   God is represented to be the first moving cause of what was done by
   them: And what he did, be it what it may, was antecedent to their
   volitions and actions, and the latter the effect of the former. And if
   their liberty and sin consisted wholly in their voluntary exercises, as
   has been proved; then they were as free and as blameable, as if nothing
   had been determined and done, antecedent to their determinations and
   choice, and as necessary to their taking place, whatever it was. And
   whatever is implied in God's moving them, and stirring up their spirits
   to act as they did, it was only in order to bring to pass his
   infinitely wise, important and good purposes, or executing his holy
   decrees; and therefore was infinitely wise and holy; and directly
   contrary to the views, inclinations and designs of these wicked men:
   and therefore consistent with his abhorring their doings: his
   displeasure with them, and punishing them for their wickedness.

   3. Agreeable to the last particular, the scriptures represent God as
   moving the hearts of all men, just as he pleases; and even when they do
   that which is sinful.

   "Draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity;
   which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their
   hearts." [92]

   "From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants
   of the earth, He fashioneth their hearts alike." That is, He forms the
   heart of every one equally, of one, as well as another. [93]

   "He turned their heart to hate his people; to deal subtilly with his
   servants." [94] "Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not unto
   covetousness." [95] "Incline not mine heart to any evil thing, to
   practise wicked works with men that work iniquity." [96] "For God hath
   put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their
   kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
   [97] These are the ten kings and their subjects, mentioned in the
   preceding context, who join to support the beast, and make war with
   Christ and his people. God is here said to put it in their hearts, to
   do this, so far, and so long, as this is necessary, in order to answer
   his ends, and fulfil his infinitely wise and important designs. This
   cannot import less than that God has the hearts of these kings, and all
   under them, so in his hand and under his direction, that he turns them
   as he pleases, to accomplish his purposes; so that he makes them answer
   his ends, in all their opposition to him. Agreeable to this, it is
   said, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of
   water: He turneth it whithersoever he will." [98] If God does turn the
   heart of the king, whithersoever he will; then his heart, his will and
   choice, is always and in every instance under God's direction and
   control; and there can be no motion, determination, or exertion of his
   heart, which is not as God wills it to be. Every turn of his heart then
   is an event which God wills should take place, and therefore
   foreordained that it should come to pass just as it does. And God, in
   thus turning the heart, is in this sense, the origin and cause of every
   motion, choice or volition, in which the heart turns this way, or that.
   And if the heart of the king is thus in the hand of the Lord, and he
   turneth it whithersoever he will; then the hearts of all his subjects,
   yea, of all men, may be, and actually are as much in the hand of God.
   This is implied in the assertion under consideration. The heart of the
   king is mentioned, as he has great power and influence over others, and
   is most absolute and despotic, and commonly most obstinate and
   inflexible. Even his heart, as well as the heart of all others, is in
   the hand of the Lord; wholly under his power and influence, and is
   turned by him just as he pleases. The same thing is asserted in many
   passages of scripture, some of which have been mentioned; as that of
   God's representing the king of Syria as sent by him to distress Israel
   and Judah; and as an axe or saw in his hand, directed and moved by Him
   to execute his will; his speaking of other kings as raised up and sent
   by Him, to be his servants to do his pleasure; and putting it into
   their hearts to fulfil his will, &c. But, in these words of Solomon
   this is asserted in the most express and strongest manner, of the heart
   of kings and of all men; so that it seems impossible not to understand,
   or to evade the truth here expressed: As no words, perhaps, can be
   devised to convey it in a more clear, unequivocal and decisive manner.

   All the objections made against God's foreordaining all the moral evil
   that takes place, and his being, in this sense, and so far, the origin
   and cause of it, as has been asserted and explained above, do equally
   lie, and are as strong against this passage, and many others which have
   been mentioned, under this and former particulars.

   4. In Divine Revelation an evil spirit which is in men and takes place
   among them, is said to be from God; and to be sent or caused by him.

   "Then God sent an evil spirit, between Abimelech and the men of
   Shechem: And the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech."
   [99] "But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
   from the Lord troubled him. And it came to pass on the morrow that the
   evil spirit from God came upon Saul." [100] "Now therefore the Lord
   hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets." [101]
   "The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: And they
   have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof." [102] Whatever be
   meant by an evil, lying and perverse spirit, whether it be no more than
   the evil inclination and exercise of the hearts of men; or an evil
   agent, distinct from their spirits, exciting them to sinful exercises;
   God is in these scriptures represented as superintending and ordering
   this spirit to take place in men, as it did. And if he did this, and
   yet maintained his own infinitely holy character, and these men were
   notwithstanding, wholly free in their evil inclinations and conduct,
   and accountable and deserving of blame and punishment for them; which
   was most certainly the case: Then all the evil volitions of men may be,
   in the same sense, manner and degree, from God, consistent with all
   these. It is therefore easy to see, that all objections against the
   doctrine under consideration, may with equal reason be made against
   such declarations as these, which are found in the holy scriptures.

   5. God is said, in the scriptures, to order, send and effect the sinful
   deceptions and delusions of men. "With him is strength and wisdom: The
   deceived and the deceiver are his." [103] "O Lord, why hast thou made
   us to err from thy ways?" [104] "And if the prophet be deceived when he
   hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet." [105] "And
   for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should
   believe a lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." [106] According to these
   passages, the divine hand and agency are concerned in all the errors
   and deceptions which take place among men, by which many of them run on
   to destruction.

   6. In the scriptures, God is many times said to blind the minds, and
   harden the hearts of men. This is often ascribed to him, in the most
   express terms, without saying any thing to qualify, soften, or explain
   the expressions, or to intimate that they are not to be taken in their
   plain, natural meaning. These will be now produced, as worthy of
   particular attention.

   "And he said, go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but understand
   not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people
   fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: Lest they see with
   their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
   and convert, and be healed." [107] We have this remarkable passage
   quoted in St. John's gospel, in the following words, and applied to the
   Jews in his day. "Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias
   said, He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts; that they
   should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be
   converted, and I should heal them." Here those words in Isaiah, Make
   the heart of this people fat and shut their eyes, have the meaning of
   them given in the following words, He, that is God, hath blinded their
   eyes and hardened their hearts, God is here said to do what Isaiah was
   directed to do; for the prophet was infinitely unequal to produce the
   effect, and could be only the instrument by whom God caused it to take
   place. In this view, and in no other, the Evangelist appears to have
   given the true sense of the passage, while he uses these strong and
   pointed expressions.

   "For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and
   hath closed your eyes. They have not known, nor understood: For he hath
   shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they
   cannot understand." [108] "Israel hath not obtained that which he
   seeketh for: But the election hath obtained it, and the rest were
   blinded," (or hardened, as it is in the original,) "According as it is
   written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they
   should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day."
   [109]

   Those passages are now to be produced, in which hardening the hearts of
   men is expressly ascribed to God. This is done more than ten times, in
   the history of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. "But I will harden his heart,
   that he shall not let the people go." [110] "And I will harden
   Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of
   Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you." [111] "And he hardened
   Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had
   said." [112] "And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he
   harkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses." [113] "And
   the Lord said unto Moses, go in unto Pharaoh: For I have hardened his
   heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs
   before him: and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of
   thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which
   I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord," [114]
   "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
   children of Israel go." [115] "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart,
   and he would not let them go." [116] "And Moses and Aaron did all these
   wonders before Pharaoh: And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that
   he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land." [117] "And
   I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I
   will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
   Egyptians may know that I am the Lord." [118] "And the Lord hardened
   the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children
   of Israel." "And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
   and they shall follow them: And I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and
   upon all his host." [119]

   There are other passages in which God is said to harden the hearts of
   men, which are now to be mentioned. "But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would
   not let us pass by him, For the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and
   made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hands as
   appeareth this day." [120] "For it was of the Lord to harden their
   hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might
   destroy them utterly." [121] "O Lord, why hast thou hardened our heart
   from thy fear?" [122] It might be safely and with good reason argued
   from these instances of God's hardening the hearts of men, that God
   hardens every heart that is hard and obstinate; as no reason can be
   given why he should do this, in one instance, and not in another; or
   there is the same reason why the hardness and obstinacy of men's hearts
   in general, and wherever it takes place, should be as really ascribed
   to God, as these instances which are mentioned; and there can be no
   objection against his hardening the hearts of all men, whose hearts are
   hard, that may not with equal reason be made against his hardening the
   heart of Pharaoh, and others concerning whom it is expressly asserted.
   But this is made certain, as the consequence is drawn to our hand, by
   one under divine inspiration. "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
   have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth." [123] The apostle in these
   words has reference to God's hardening the heart of Pharaoh, whom he
   mentions in the words immediately preceding; and from this instance of
   God's raising him up and hardening his heart, to answer his own
   infinitely wise purposes, he makes this inference: "Therefore hath he
   mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth." Here
   every one of mankind is comprehended in those on whom God has mercy,
   and those whom he hardeneth; and it is asserted that he hardeneth all
   those on whom he will not have mercy, that is, all whose hearts are
   hardened. It must be farther observed,

   7. In the sacred scriptures, God is expressly said to form, make, or
   produce moral evil.

   "The Lord hath made all things for himself: Yea, even the wicked for
   the day of evil." [124] Here God is said to make the wicked, not
   considered merely as men; but as wicked: for in this character, or as
   wicked only, are they the proper subjects of natural evil, or
   punishment. What less can his making the wicked mean, than his having
   some hand or agency, in some way or other, in forming their character
   as wicked? And is this any less or more, than his willing that there
   should be such existences as wicked men; because moral and natural evil
   are necessary, as necessary as any other existence, to answer the
   infinitely wise and important purposes of God, in the brightest display
   of his perfections? He has made them for himself, to put them to his
   own use, and by them to manifest his own character, his holiness,
   hatred of sin, &c.

   "I am the Lord, and there is none else; there is no God besides me: I
   girded thee, though thou hast not known me: That they may know from the
   rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me. I
   am the Lord, and there is none else. I form light, and create darkness:
   I make peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all these things." [125]

   These words are addressed to Cyrus, who was not then born: But was to
   arise in the eastern world, to conquer the Babylonians, and to release
   the Jews from their captivity, and order the temple and Jerusalem to be
   rebuilt. He was born and educated where the God of Israel was not
   known, and where they were taught, that the good being who was the
   author of all good, was not the only power that reigned; but that there
   was an evil being or principle, which reigned so far as to counteract
   the good principle or being, and introduce all the evil, both moral and
   natural, which takes place; and of which he is the proper cause or
   author. The good principle, or being, they represented by light, and
   worshipped him before the sun or fire, considering it the brightest
   emblem of him, and in a peculiar manner possessed or inhabited by him.
   The evil being and the evil of which they supposed him to be the cause
   and author, they represented by, and called, darkness. There is an
   evident reference to these false and hurtful notions, in which Cyrus
   was educated, in the address to him, part of which has now been cited;
   in which Jehovah declares them to be great and dangerous delusions, and
   repeatedly asserts, that he is the only Supreme God. "I am the Lord,
   and there is none else; there is no other God besides me. I am the
   Lord, and there is none besides me." And then he asserts that he is the
   cause of all that which they ascribed to the evil being, which they
   believed in, and feared. "I form light, and create darkness; I make
   peace and create evil. I the Lord do all these things." [126]

   Does not God, in these words, expressly take to himself this character,
   and assert that he is the origin and cause of all evil? If so, then we
   have no reason to be afraid to think and speak of him- as such: but may
   consider ourselves as promoting true piety, and the honour of the only
   true God, while we believe and assert, that all evil is the consequence
   of his determination and will, that it shall exist, and is wholly
   dependent upon it; as without his will that it should take place, it
   could no more exist, than any thing else whatsoever. No one can devise
   stronger terms or language to express this, than that which is here
   used by God himself. How this appears to be consistent with the
   infinite wisdom and holiness of the divine character, and most
   honourable to God, has been repeatedly shown, in what has been already
   said on this subject: and therefore it need not be again repeated here.

   But it has been said by many, -that moral evil is not meant by darkness
   and evil in this passage; but only natural evil, or calamity and pain.
   Of this God may be, and is, the cause, but not of sin. To this the
   following reply may be made.

   1. The opinion to which this passage has reference had respect to moral
   evil as well as natural: yea, this was chiefly in view, as the former
   is the origin and occasion of the latter. And the evil being was
   considered as having the direction and disposal of moral evil; so that
   it originated from him as the cause. Therefore if this was designed to
   be excluded in the passage before us, which is spoken to Cyrus, and has
   reference to that notion in the east, respecting the cause of moral
   evil, as well as natural, it must have been done by an express
   exception: For without this, and as it now stands, Cyrus, and every one
   else, must consider it as included and intended, as well as natural
   evil. Nor can it be now excluded, without doing violence to the text;
   and at the same time really gaining nothing by it: For if it be allowed
   that moral evil is intended here, as well as natural, no more is really
   asserted than is expressed in many other passages in the Bible, as
   every one may be sensible, who will attend to what has been before
   produced from the scriptures, under this head.

   2. If it be granted that natural evil only is directly intended here;
   yet this will necessarily involve moral evil; for a great part of the
   former which takes place among men, is the natural and necessary result
   of the latter. It is effected by the exercise of men's selfishness and
   lusts. "From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
   hence, even of your lusts, that war in your members?" [127] "But if ye
   bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of
   another." [128] If therefore the divine Being has no direction and
   government of the wills and evil conduct of men, he cannot be said to
   create or produce, or even to regulate and superintend natural evil. If
   God does not will, direct and order a war, which is wholly carried on
   by the exercise of men's lusts; how can he be said to direct, will and
   order the attendant or consequent natural evil? How does he cause or
   produce the one, more than the other? In this view, we may turn to the
   words of the prophet Amos. "Shall there be evil in the city, and the
   Lord hath not done it?" Here evil is mentioned without restriction,
   confining it to natural evil: But if it be supposed that natural evil
   is particularly meant here; yet this implies moral evil: as the natural
   evil, the calamity, sufferings and distresses which take place in a
   city, are chiefly the concomitants or fruits of vice and folly. And if
   the Most High has no concern or hand in directing, ordering and
   producing the latter; how can he be said to produce or effect the
   former; or how can it be said to be done by him, since it is the
   necessary attendant and fruit of the sin of men; and it is really done
   by them, and they are as really the cause of natural evil, as they are
   of their own sin, as the former is involved in the latter?

   3. It must farther be observed, that if natural evil only, be meant by
   evil in the above passages in Isaiah and Amos; yet there is as great,
   and the same difficulty, in accounting for God's creating and doing
   this, as there is in accounting for his determining and willing the
   existence of moral evil: Or the same objections lie, and may be urged
   with as much reason, against God's willing, causing and producing
   natural evil, which are or can be made against his willing that moral
   evil should exist.

   If this proposition can be demonstrated, and made plain to every one
   who will allow himself to think calmly on the subject; then all the
   objections which have been made against God's foreordaining whatsoever
   comes to pass, and all that is necessarily implied in this, will fall
   to the ground; and the ways and labour which have been taken to
   construe the scriptures mentioned above, so as not to imply that God
   is, in any sense, the origin and cause of moral evil, lest they should
   be understood in a sense dishonourable to him, will appear to be
   needless, and unreasonable. Let this matter, then, be carefully
   considered.

   Natural evil is as really contrary to infinite goodness, as moral evil
   is; infinite goodness cannot be reconciled to it, considered in and by
   itself, but is infinitely opposed to it: And to suppose that God wills
   and causes it to take place, for its own sake, and because he delights
   in it, in itself considered, is as dishonourable to him, and does as
   much impeach and deny his goodness, as to suppose that he wills and
   causes moral evil, for its own sake, and because he is pleased with it,
   and delights in it. Yea, to say that God causes natural evil to take
   place, for its own sake, and because he is pleased with it, in itself
   considered, is to charge him with moral evil, or that which is
   infinitely contrary to infinite holiness or goodness, as really as to
   say that he causes moral evil because he is pleased with moral evil, as
   such.

   Therefore, if when God says in the passage under consideration, "I
   create darkness and evil, I the Lord do all these things," this is to
   be understood of natural evil only; it cannot mean, that God causes
   this evil, for its own sake; for this necessarily supposes him to be an
   evil being; but he causes it to take place, he creates it, for some
   good end, and for the sake of the good, of which the evil is the
   occasion or means; and without which evil, the good could not possibly
   take place; so that on the whole, there is much more good or happiness,
   than could have been, had there been no natural evil. If natural evil
   could answer no good end, and were not necessary, in order to this, it
   could not be created or made to take place, or be permitted to take
   place, by an infinitely good Being who has the disposal of all things:
   But if it be necessary to answer the best end, and to promote and
   produce the greatest good of the whole; then it may be not only
   permitted, but created, or caused to take place, consistent with
   infinite goodness; yea, it is inconsistent with infinite goodness, not
   to do so.

   And who does not now see, that God may determine, order and cause moral
   evil to take place, and, in this sense, create it, consistent with his
   infinite holiness and goodness, if this be necessary for the greatest
   good of the whole, both moral and natural; yea, that God could, not be
   infinitely wise and good, if, on this supposition, he did not order and
   cause it to take place? If the divine conduct can be vindicated in
   causing natural evil to take place; on the same ground it can be
   vindicated in causing moral evil to exist; and not one objection can be
   made against the latter, which may not equally, and with as good
   reason, be made against the former. For instance, if it should be
   objected against the latter, that to make God the origin and cause of
   sin, is to suppose moral evil is in him; for there can be nothing in
   the effect which is not in the cause: This may with equal truth and
   reason be said of natural evil. If God be die origin and cause of it,
   this supposes natural evil to be in him, and that he is infinitely
   unhappy and miserable; for there can be nothing in the effect which is
   not in the cause. Again, if it be objected, that if it be agreeable to
   the will of God that sin should exist, and he chose it should take
   place, and is therefore the origin and cause of its existence; then sin
   is agreeable to his will, and he is pleased with it: It may with as
   much propriety, and as good reason, be said, if God wills the existence
   of natural evil, and causes it to take place; then he is pleased with
   it, and delights in the misery of his creatures; consequently he cannot
   be a good, but a morally evil being. If the objector, to remove the
   difficulty that is urged upon him, should say, that God does not cause
   natural evil, for the sake of the evil, but for the sake of the good
   end to be answered by it; he may be asked, Why this, which is as true
   of moral evil, does not equally remove the difficulty respecting God's
   being the cause and origin of that? If it solves the difficulty in one
   case, it must do so in the other. If God may order and cause natural
   evil, which, in itself, is infinitely contrary to his goodness, to
   exist, consistently with his goodness; then he may will and cause moral
   evil to exist, though it be, in itself considered, infinitely contrary
   to his holiness, and most odious to him: And no one can account for the
   former, without giving as good a reason for the latter. Is it not very
   unreasonable and most absurdly inconsistent, for men perpetually, and
   with great assurance to object and urge that against the supposition
   that God wills and chooses the existence of moral evil, which may be
   with as much reason urged against his willing the existence of natural
   evil; while they allow he does will and cause the latter: And at the
   same time cannot tell how this is consistent with the divine
   perfections, without offering a reason, which equally proves the other
   to be as consistent?

   It has been said, that if it be best, on the whole, that sin should
   take place, as it is necessary to promote the general good, then sin is
   a good thing; and the more sin the better. Now, this may be with as
   much reason said of natural evil. If God order that, to answer a good
   end, then it is a good thing, and the more of it the better. The
   inference from the latter, is as well grounded, as from the former. In
   truth, it is in both instances utterly unreasonable. That which is in
   itself, in its own nature, evil, may by God be made the occasion of the
   greatest good; and this is so far from altering the nature of the evil,
   or making it less an evil, in itself considered, that if this should be
   the case, and it were possible, the end to be answered by it would be
   defeated, and there would be no evil, to be the occasion of good. It is
   indeed a good thing, that evil, both moral and natural, should take
   place; and the good of which this is the occasion swallows up the evil,
   and the whole taken together is the most complete, perfectly beautiful,
   and good system: But this alters not the nature of the evil, and it is
   still as evil, as contrary to all good, and as disagreeable and
   hateful, considered in itself, and as unconnected with the whole, as if
   it were not made the occasion of good; but of evil. But this has been
   often brought into view before. It is again introduced, to show the
   unreasonableness of the objection, and that it is as much against the
   existence of natural evil, in order to answer a good end, as it is
   against the existence of moral evil, for the same end. The infinitely
   wise Being most perfectly knows how much evil, both natural and moral,
   and what particular instances of it, are necessary, in order to
   accomplish the greatest possible good; and all this takes place by his
   decree and will, and no more. The existence of just so much, and no
   more, is desirable, as it is necessary to accomplish the best end: But
   God will not suffer any more to exist; the remainder he will
   effectually restrain. If he did not, and more than is necessary to
   answer the best ends should take place, it would be infinitely
   undesirable and evil, and inconsistent with the divine perfections. How
   unreasonable then is it to say, "If evil be necessary for the good of
   the whole, and thus answers a good end, then the more evil the better!"

   It has been farther objected, that if God wills the existence of sin,
   and it is therefore agreeable to his will that it should take place in
   every instance, when and wherever it does; then the sinner does not
   resist his will in sinning, nor can be blameable for it; but rather
   ought to sin, that good may come. Let it now be carefully and with
   impartiality considered, whether this objection may not with just as
   good reason be urged against God's willing and causing all the natural
   evil which takes place. If any one, by his sin, cause natural evil to
   take place, by oppressing and afflicting the widow and fatherless, or
   by murdering his neighbour; or in any other instance; he voluntarily
   does that which is agreeable to the will of God, that it should take
   place. He has not resisted the will of God; but has complied with his
   will and designs: Therefore he cannot be blamed for it; but rather
   ought to do all this, since without his agency this natural evil would
   not take place, which God has determined should be done, because
   necessary to effect the greatest good, and accomplish his own wise
   design. In short, if God be pleased with the existence of that natural
   evil which is effected by the oppressor, murderer, &c. then he cannot
   blame or be displeased with the oppressor or murderer, for being also
   pleased with the existence of this evil, and exerting themselves to
   produce it. Is there any way to answer this objection, and remove the
   difficulty, unless it be in the words of Joseph to his brethren? "As
   for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good:" [129]
   There was a direct and total opposition and contrariety between the
   will of God that this evil should take place, and the will and design
   of Joseph's brethren, in desiring and effecting this natural evil,
   consisting in his being made a slave in Egypt. God ordered it, and took
   measures effectually to produce the evil, not from any pleasure in the
   evil itself; but in the exercise of his infinite goodness, because it
   was necessary to accomplish the greatest good of which this evil was
   the occasion. "He meant it unto good." But the brethren of Joseph,
   thought and designed evil against him: They did it in the exercise of
   malevolence, or ill will towards him; which was most unreasonable, and
   was in the nature of it, enmity against that good, for the sake of
   which God ordered this evil to take place; and therefore was directly
   opposed to that benevolent will of God, which determined and ordered
   this evil. Their disposition and will in this affair were just as
   opposite to the disposition and will of God in determining and willing
   the existence of this evil, as malevolence is to benevolence and
   goodness, or as evil is to good; and therefore must be displeasing and
   hateful to God; and they as blameable in his sight, as if he had
   brought no good out of it, and nothing but evil had taken place. As
   this is the only solution of the difficulty, and fully removes the
   objection respecting God's willing and causing natural evil; it is easy
   for every one who attends, to see that it equally answers the objection
   against his willing and causing moral evil: And shews how the existence
   of both may be chosen and caused by God, not for their own sake, but
   for the sake of the good end answered by them; and consistent with his
   hating them both, in themselves considered; so that in him it is an
   exercise of infinite benevolence; and therefore directly contrary to
   the disposition and will of the sinner in sinning, and in willing and
   producing natural evil. And consequently shews how justly God is
   displeased with the sinner, and blames him for willing and choosing,
   both moral and natural evil.

   These things have been observed to show that when God says "I create
   evil," in the passage above cited, moral evil as well as natural may be
   intended; as there can be no difficulty or objection thought of, if the
   former be included, which is not equally against the latter; and if the
   former must be excluded, as inconsistent with the divine perfections,
   in any sense and view, to form and create it; for the same reason must
   the latter be excluded: And that moral evil must be intended, as well
   as natural, not only because nothing is said to exclude it; but because
   the occasion and design of the words do necessarily include both.

   The words of St. Paul seem to claim a place under this head. "Thou wilt
   say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his
   will? Nay, but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God! Shall
   the thing formed say to him that formed it. Why hast thou made me thus?
   Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
   vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?" [130] Upon these words
   the following observations may be made.

   1. The objection here introduced by the Apostle has reference to his
   assertion in the preceding verse, and is grounded upon it, "And whom he
   will he hardeneth." And this same objection is made now, and always has
   been made by men, against the truth here asserted; which is, that it is
   the will of God, that all the hardness and obstinacy of heart which is
   found amongst men, should exist just as it does; and therefore he has
   foreordained, according to the counsel of his own will, that it shall
   take place. So much, at least, is expressed in these words of the
   Apostle; and indeed no more than what is implied in this: For whatever
   God wills to take place, has a cause of its certain existence; and this
   can be found no where but in the divine will. The objection is, "If all
   the sins of men take place by the will of God, and according to his
   will; then there can be no crime in sin; and men cannot be justly
   blamed for that, the existence of which is agreeable to his w ill.

   2. It is observable, that the Apostle in his answer to this objection,
   does not say that the objector had mistaken his meaning; and that he
   had not said that it was agreeable to the will of God that the hardness
   of men's hearts, and every instance of obstinacy and sin, should take
   place just as it does; and therefore the divine purpose and agency was
   concerned in all this; but implicitly grants that this is a truth, and
   that he had asserted it; by not only not denying it; but proceeding to
   vindicate it in his answer; by which the meaning of his words is fixed
   beyond a doubt.

   3. In his answer he is so far from palliating what he had said, or
   softening down his expression, to which the objection is made, that he
   rather heightens it, and expresses himself in a stronger manner, if
   possible. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
   thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same
   lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?" The
   potter makes one vessel as really and as much as another; that which is
   made to dishonour, and that which is made unto honour. Therefore, if
   the similitude is any thing to the purpose, and does not give a very
   wrong idea of the matter, which it is designed to illustrate, all
   sinners whose hearts are hardened, who are represented by the vessels
   made unto dishonour, are as really formed and made such as they are,
   hardened sinners, as the vessel unto dishonour is made a dishonourable
   vessel, by the potter: And God's sovereign right to do this is here
   asserted; and he who objects to this, the Apostle says, speaks against
   God. Besides, the Apostle expressly asserts that the hardened sinner is
   formed and made so by God. "Shall the thing formed say to him that
   formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?" Thus the Apostle speaks this
   out, and repeats it in the most express and pointed language, without
   fear of hurting any one by it; and with assurance that he is espousing
   the cause of God, and vindicating his rights and honour, in opposition
   to an apostate world.

   The Apostle, having asserted the sovereign right of God to form his
   creatures as he pleases, in the next words gives the reason of this,
   and mentions the important end he has in view, and answers, by making
   the wicked for the day of evil. "What if God, willing (or determined)
   to show his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long
   suffering the vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction: And that he
   might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which
   he had afore prepared unto glory? "

   The following things are suggested by these words.

   1. That God does not harden sinners, or punish them, for the sake of
   hardening and making them miserable, or because he has any delight or
   pleasure in their sin and punishment, considered in themselves, and
   unconnected with the end to be answered by them: But he does this to
   answer a wise and important end, which could not be answered in any
   other way; and to produce a good, which infinitely overbalances the
   evil, which is necessary in order to it.

   2. We are here told what this great all important end is, which God
   designs to effect; the good which is produced by the persevering sin,
   and destruction of men, who are the vessels of wrath. It is the
   manifestation and display of his own perfection; "To show his wrath,
   and make his power known: And to make known the riches of his glory."
   That is, he does this for himself, for his own glory. This perfectly
   coincides with the words of Solomon, which have been mentioned, and
   serves to fix the sense of them. "The Lord hath made all things for
   himself: Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil."

   3. It is here supposed, that what God does in hardening sinners, and
   making them vessels unto dishonour, and enduring with much long
   suffering these vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction, is consistent
   with their being blameable for their hardness, and every thing which
   renders them dishonourable: and with his being highly displeased with
   them for it; and that he may justly destroy them forever, for their
   hardness and obstinacy in sin. This is supposed, and really asserted,
   in the words; for, in any other view, they would be inconsistent and
   absurd; as otherwise, sinners could not be vessels of wrath, fitted to
   destruction. Whatever men have thought, and may think and assert, St.
   Paul, and he by whom he was inspired, knew that both these are
   perfectly consistent. How these things are consistent, does appear, it
   is hoped, from what has been said above, and may be yet farther
   offered, on this head.

   Having thus considered what is the language of scripture on this point,
   and made particular remarks on the passages which have been adduced;
   some more general observations on the whole, in one general view of
   them, must now be made, hoping they may serve to throw farther light on
   the subject, and confirm the truth exhibited respecting it in divine
   revelation, which has been so difficult and intricate to many.

   1. It appears from these passages of scripture, that God has
   foreordained all the moral evil which does take place; and is, in such
   a sense, and so far, the origin and cause of it, that he is said to
   bring it to pass, by his own agency. Therefore it is not bold or
   dangerous to believe and assert this; but it is for the honour of God,
   and tends to promote the good of men: And to believe and assert the
   contrary, is directly the reverse, bold, dangerous, dishonourable to
   God, and hurtful to man. It is safe to speak according to the
   scriptures; and so far as any man does not, it is because, in that
   instance, there is no light in him. [131]

   2. If these scriptures be understood, as many have chosen to understand
   them, as importing only that God permits sin, and so orders every thing
   respecting the event, that, he permitting, it will certainly take place
   just as it does; this really comes to die same thing, or if not, does
   not obviate any difficulty, which has been thought to attend the
   representation which has now been made of this matter. For they who
   choose this way of speaking do represent God as willing that sin should
   take place; or on die whole, preferring and choosing that it should
   exist, rather than not. And this, as has been shown, implies all that
   is intended by his being the origin and cause of sin; and ordering and
   doing every thing, that was necessary to be ordered and done, previous
   to the existence of sin, in order to render it certain, in every
   instance where it does take place. His decree turns the point in favour
   of the existence of sin: And his agency makes it certain, without which
   it could have no existence.

   And if God determined to permit all the sin which does take place, and
   by his agency orders things so, that, he permitting it, it will be
   done, this is liable to all the objections that have been, or can be
   male against the assertion, that all the sinful volitions of men are
   the effect of the divine agency. For the former makes sin as certain
   and necessary as the latter; and it is no more consistent with the
   holiness of God, and his hatred of sin, to will the existence of it,
   and lay a plan to have it take place, upon his permission, than it is,
   directly to cause it to exist in the creature, by any agency or
   exertion whatever, which is previously necessary to the existence of
   sinful volitions. And the former is not only liable to all the
   objections that can be made against the latter; but, so far as it
   differs from the latter, supposes an effect without any real origin or
   cause, and therefore involves the greatest difficulty and absurdity
   imaginable, as has been shown above. Why then is it not most
   reasonable, safe and best, to understand these scriptures in their most
   plain and obvious meaning, since by a strained or forced
   interpretation, no difficulty is removed, and nothing is obtained; and
   by explaining away the most easy and natural meaning, new and
   inextricable difficulties are incurred? [132]

   In short, there appears to be no rational or consistent medium, between
   admitting that God, according to the scriptures, has chosen and
   determined that all the moral evil which does, or ever will exist,
   should take place, and consequently is so far the origin and cause of
   it: Or believing and asserting, that sin has taken place, in every
   view, and in all respects, contrary to his will, he having done all he
   could to prevent the existence of it; but was not able; and is
   therefore not the infinitely happy, uncontrollable, supreme Governor of
   the world; but is dependent, disappointed, and miserable! No one,
   surely, will adopt the latter: How then can he avoid admitting the
   former?

   3. If the scriptures which have been mentioned, where hardening the
   hearts of men, blinding and shutting their eyes, and inclining and
   turning their hearts, when they practise moral evil, &c.--if these
   scriptures are to be understood, as meaning no more than that God
   orders their situation and external circumstances to be such, that,
   considering their disposition, and the evil bias of their minds, they
   will without any other influence, be blinded and hardened, &c. then all
   those scriptures, which speak of God's changing and softening the
   heart, taking away the hard heart, and giving a heart of flesh; opening
   the eyes of men, and turning them from darkness to light, and from sin
   to holiness, working in them to will and to do, and causing them to
   walk in his ways, &c. may and must be understood in the same way, as
   not intending any special divine influence on the mind, as the origin
   and cause of virtuous, obedient, holy volitions; but only his using
   means with them in an external way; putting them under advantages, and
   setting motives before them; so that if they be well disposed, or will
   dispose themselves to obedience, they may be holy, &c. To be sure, it
   cannot be argued from the expressions themselves, that the latter
   express or intend any more real influence on the minds of men, or
   divine agency, by which God is the origin and cause of virtuous
   exercises; than the former do with respect to men's sinful exercises;
   for the expressions are as unlimited, plain and strong, which speak of
   the former, as those which are used for the latter.

   The Arminian, and all of his cast, understand the latter, as they do
   the former, as intending no internal, decisive influence on the mind,
   turning the heart or will one way, or the other; but ordering external
   circumstances, &c. And are they not herein more consistent, than the
   professed Calvinist, who insists that the latter cannot be understood
   as expressing less, than that God, by his agency and influence on the
   minds of men, does actually produce all virtuous volitions, as their
   real origin and cause; while he as confidently asserts, that the former
   cannot mean any such thing; but understands them as the Arminian does:
   Were they consistent, they would give up the cause to the Arminian, and
   own that the latter expressions may well be understood, as he
   understands them, and must mean no more, if the former do not. This is
   mentioned, it must be observed, as argumentum ad hominem, to convince
   these professed Calvinists, or whatever they choose to call themselves,
   that they are really inconsistent; and, in this point, are taking a
   measure to strengthen their opposers, rather than to convince or
   confute them. This leads to another observation.

   4. They who object to the divine agency being the origin and cause of
   sinful volitions, because, in their view, this is inconsistent with
   freedom and moral agency, in such volitions, and with any blame or
   crime in that which is the effect of such a cause; must, if consistent
   with themselves, reject the doctrine of the divine agency, as the cause
   of virtuous volitions and exercises, on the same ground, and for the
   same reason.

   If any kind or degree of supposed influence and agency, which is
   antecedent to a man's volition, and the cause of its taking place,
   renders such volition not free, and not the man's own volition and
   exercise, so that he is neither virtuous nor vicious in having and
   exerting such a choice; then there is no freedom or virtue in the
   exercises of those called good men, which are the effect of powerful
   divine influence, causing them to take place; But if such agency and
   influence, producing virtuous volitions in men, be consistent with the
   freedom of men, in such volitions; and they are as much their own
   exercises, and they are as virtuous, and as much their own virtue, as
   if they had taken place without such previous influence; or as they
   could be, on any possible supposition; then all this is as true of all
   contrary or sinful volitions of men, whatever kind or degree of
   influence and agency be exerted, antecedent to their existence, and as
   the cause of it.

   This observation is made for the sake of those, who make the above
   objection against there being any origin or cause of sinful volitions,
   antecedent to their existence; supposing this is inconsistent with
   man's freedom and blame in such exercises: And yet they believe and
   assert, that all virtuous exercises of men are the fruit and effect of
   divine influence, as their origin, which efficaciously causes them to
   take place; and that these exercises are as really and as much their
   own, and as virtuous, and praise worthy, as if they had taken place,
   without any such previous influence and cause, were this possible. It
   is desirable that this palpable, gross inconsistence of theirs might be
   discerned, and attended to by them; upon which they would drop this
   objection, as wholly without foundation, or urge it equally against the
   virtuous exercises of men, being the effect of any previous, divine,
   efficacious influence, as their origin and cause; and renounce it as
   inconsistent with the liberty a: id moral agency of men; by which they
   will be consistent with themselves in this point, however inconsistent
   they may be with the Bible.

   Both the one and the other is indeed equally and altogether consistent
   with human liberty, and with virtue and sin. No supposeable or possible
   influence or agency, previous to the exercises of the will, which is
   the origin and cause of such exercises, can render men less free in
   such voluntary exercises, or the less virtuous or vicious: And that
   because liberty consists, and is exercised in willing and choosing; and
   in nothing that does or can take place antecedent to the volitions of
   men, or as the consequence of them: And virtue and sin consist in the
   exercises of the will or heart, and in nothing else; and men are sinful
   or holy according to the nature and quality of these. These are most
   certain and evident truths, which has been in some measure shown above;
   and which ought to be always kept ill view, when attending to this
   subject.

   5. There is a certain connection between God's hardening the hearts of
   men, and shutting or blinding their eyes, whatever this may be, or
   imply; and their voluntarily hardening their own hearts, and shutting
   or closing their own eyes; so that when or wherever the one takes
   place, the other does also.

   When God is said to harden Pharaoh's heart, he is, at the same time,
   said to harden his own heart. God said to Moses, that he would harden
   the heart of Pharaoh. [133] And it is repeatedly said, that he hardened
   his own heart, as the Lord had said, [134] referring to his saying,
   that he would harden the heart of Pharaoh. So it is said, [135] Pharaoh
   sinned yet more, and hardened his heart; and in the first verse of the
   tenth chapter, the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have
   hardened his heart; referring to the instance just before mentioned, of
   Pharaoh's hardening his own heart. Hence it appears, that whenever God
   hardened the heart of Pharaoh, he hardened his own heart; and whenever
   Pharaoh did harden his heart, God did also harden it: And that this is
   true of every instance of hardness or obstinacy of the heart, God
   hardens the heart, and the sinner himself hardens his own heart.

   It does not follow from this, as some have thought it did, that God's
   hardening the heart of Pharaoh, and his hardening his own heart, are
   one and the same thing. This supposition is contrary to the
   representation, and the express words. Here are two distinct agents,
   who are said to be concerned, and to act, in producing one and the same
   event, without which it could not take place, viz. the hardness of
   Pharaoh's heart. As the agents are infinitely distinct and different,
   and their characters directly opposite to each other; so is their
   agency; that of God is holy, that of Pharaoh sinful. Yet the one
   necessarily supposes and involves the other. The agency ascribed to
   God, is the origin and cause of the hardness of the heart, without
   which it could not take place; and of which it is the certain
   consequence. The agency ascribed to Pharaoh, and which is to be
   ascribed to every sinner whose heart is hard, is the effect or
   consequence of divine agency, and consists wholly in this effect, that
   is, in hardness of heart. The heart cannot be hardened, or there cannot
   be a hard heart, without the agency of the sinner, hardening his own
   heart; for it consists in voluntary exercise; and therefore does not,
   and cannot take place, while men are wholly passive and do not act, or
   put forth those exertions in which hardness of heart doth consist.

   When God made man a living soul, the effect produced consisted in man's
   activity, he lived; for life is not merely a passive effect, but is
   itself action. Man could not be made a living soul, without life, or
   unless he lived, and he could not live, unless he were made to live; so
   that the one, is necessarily implied in the other. Yet life is as
   really life and activity, or man as really lives, and it is as much his
   own life and activity, as if he had lived without being created or made
   to live, were this possible. Every one cannot but see how false and
   absurd it would be to say, that God's making man a living soul, and
   man's agency in living, are one and the same thing, because one
   necessarily implies the other; so that to assert one, is, in effect,
   and really to assert the other: To say, that God breathed into man the
   breath of life, implies that man lived, and does really assert it: and
   to say that man became a living soul or lived, implies the divine
   agency in causing him to live, and does really assert it; though there
   be two different agents, and two very different kinds of agency, as
   distinct and different from each other, as if there were no connection
   between them, and the one did not imply the other.

   This is applicable to the instance before us. When God hardens the
   heart of any man, that man certainly hardens his own heart, or that
   hardness is his own chosen obstinacy; and were it not so, he could have
   no hardness of heart, or his heart could not be hardened. To suppose
   the contrary, is an express contradiction. Audit is as much his own
   chosen obstinacy, and his own crime; and he is as odious and ill
   deserving, as if his Maker had no hand or concern in the matter. When
   God hardens the heart, or exerts any supposable or possible kind or
   degree of influence or power, of which sin or holiness in the creature
   is the consequence; this is so far from being or implying any
   necessitating influence, impelling or forcing men to sin, or obey, that
   it is absolutely impossible there should be any such thing, antecedent
   to the actual existence of will and choice; and it is necessarily
   implied, that the disposition, will and choice, in which the sinner's
   obstinacy consists, is the exercise of freedom, and his own choice. The
   will or heart is not capable of any such necessitating influence, by
   which it is forced to act, in opposition to acting freely; because, as
   has been observed, exercise of choice or voluntary action and freedom,
   are the same thing. To talk of a necessitating influence by which the
   will is forced to act, which deprives a man of freedom, is just as
   absurd as to say, that a man is forced to live, without having any
   life; and so as utterly to exclude it.--But this has been considered
   before.

   To return, The observation to which we are now attending, viz. That
   whenever God hardens the hearts and blinds the minds of men, they do
   harden their own hearts and shut their own eyes; and the latter is
   necessarily implied in the former, as the former is implied in the
   latter; may be farther illustrated and confirmed, by several other
   passages of scripture; which, at the same time, will serve to throw
   some light upon them.

   The Lord says to Isaiah, "Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
   understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of
   this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: Lest
   they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
   their heart, and convert, and be healed." These remarkable words are
   quoted, or referred to, no less than six times in the New Testament;
   and oftener than any other text is quoted from the Old Testament. In
   St. John's gospel it is expressed in the following words. "Therefore
   they could not believe, because that Isaiah said. He hath blinded their
   eyes, and hardened their hearts; that they should not see with their
   eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should
   heal them." In this quotation the expressions are as they are in the
   Prophet, though stronger and more decisively plain, if possible,
   representing the agency of God in blinding the eyes of men, and
   hardening their hearts. He is said to do this, and it is ascribed to
   him, as the cause; and nothing is said expressly of the agency of men
   in die matter. St. Paul is supposed to refer to these words, together
   with other passages, in the following passage. "The election hath
   obtained it; but the rest were blinded: According as it is written, God
   hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see,
   and ears that they should not hear, unto this day." [136] Here he
   speaks, agreeable to the words in Isaiah, and as St. John quotes them,
   of God as the agent, and of what he does, and he is represented as
   blinding men, giving them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should
   not see, &c. and nothing is expressly said of the agency of men. But he
   quotes these words on another occasion, in a different manner. "Well
   spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah, the Prophet, unto our fathers, saying.
   Go unto this people and say. Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not
   understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive. For the heart of
   this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing; and
   their eyes have they closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and
   hear with their ears, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
   [137] In Matthew xiii. 15, these same words are quoted by Christ
   himself, just as St. Paul quotes them here. "For this people's heart is
   waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have
   they closed." Here they are said to close or blind their own eyes, they
   are represented as active in the matter, and their agency only is
   spoken of expressly; and the divine agency is not mentioned: Whereas in
   the passages above produced, these same words of Isaiah are made to
   express, not the agency of those who are blind, in making themselves
   so; but the divine agency in shutting their eyes; so that their being
   blind and unbelieving, is ascribed to God. It is a question worthy to
   be considered. How these words in Isaiah can be consistently quoted so
   differently, and be made to speak of the agency of the sinner hardening
   his own heart, and closing his own eyes, when the Prophet expresses
   nothing but the divine agency, in hardening and blinding them, as they
   are quoted by St. John, and once by St. Paul?

   Is not the only solution, and satisfactory answer to this question,
   contained in the observation made above, viz. That whenever God hardens
   the heart, and closes the eyes of men, they harden their own hearts,
   and shut their own eyes, the one being necessarily implied and involved
   in the other; so that when it is expressly said that God hardens the
   heart of any man, or hath given him eyes that he should not see, it is
   as really asserted, that the man himself hardens his own heart, and
   closes his own eyes, as the latter is necessarily implied, it being the
   very thing expressly said to be produced as the effect of the divine
   agency. Therefore when Isaiah speaks of God as hardening men's hearts,
   and shutting their eyes, he equally asserts that these men harden their
   own hearts, and close their own eyes; and may justly, and with the
   greatest propriety be quoted, as asserting both of them, or either the
   one or the other.

   This is equally true of the light, wisdom and holiness; of good men,
   God is certainly the origin and cause of all this, according to the
   scripture. He circumcises the heart, to love him: He gives a new heart,
   and puts a new spirit in them; creates in them a clean heart, and
   renews in them a right spirit: He saves them by the washing of
   regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost: He causes them to walk
   in his statutes, and to keep his judgments and do them. [138] Yet the
   scripture speaks of them to whom God gives a new heart, and whose heart
   he circumcises, and whom he renews by his holy Spirit, as circumcising
   their own hearts; making themselves a new heart; as those who have put
   off the old man, and put on the new man; and renewed themselves in the
   spirit of their minds; and have cleansed and purified their own hearts.
   [139]

   These passages may be reconciled by observing, that the former speak
   expressly of the divine agency in the renovation of the hearts of
   sinful men, and forming them to true holiness. The latter speak of the
   agency and exercises of men, implied in their renovation and holiness,
   and in which their turning to God, and their obedience does consist:
   And which is necessarily connected with the former, and involved in it.
   Whenever and wherever God gives a new heart, the man makes himself a
   new heart, in that agency and those exercises, in which a new heart
   consists. He renews and cleanses his own heart, and circumcises it, by
   turning from sin to God; hating sin and loving God, and in all that
   agency, and those pure and holy exercises in which he conforms to the
   divine law, and to the gospel, and lives a holy life. All this is
   necessarily implied in what God does in giving a new heart, as it is
   the effect which he produces by his agency; and these are connected,
   and involved in each other, as are the cause and effect: So that to
   assert one, is equally to assert the existence of the other. The
   sinner's heart cannot be made a clean heart, by the divine agency, in
   any other way, but by the sinner's cleansing his own heart; because a
   clean heart consists in those exercises of the man, in which he does
   cleanse his own heart. It is a contradiction to say, that God has
   circumcised the heart of a man to love him; and yet the man does not
   love him, or, which is the same, has not circumcised his own heart to
   love the Lord: And so of the rest. Therefore when God says, he will
   give a new heart and put a new spirit within men; it is really asserted
   that they shall renew their own hearts, in the proper exercises and
   agency, in which a new heart and new spirit consists; or that they
   shall walk in his ways. And on the contrary, whenever a man makes him a
   new heart, and becomes obedient, this implies all that divine agency,
   by which God gives a new heart: And therefore by asserting the former
   to exist, the latter is really asserted. If a man purifies himself, and
   cleanses his own heart, in pure, holy exercises, it is certain that God
   has created in him a clean, a new heart; and to assert the former or
   the latter, is really to assert both.

   Here are two distinct agents, infinitely different; God, absolutely
   independent, and almighty; and a creature absolutely dependent for
   every thought and volition, having no power and sufficiency, that is
   not derived immediately from his Maker: and the agency or operation is
   as distinct and different as the agents. The creature's agency is as
   much his own as in the nature of things it can be, and as it could be,
   if it were not the effect of the divine agency, if this were possible.
   And the creature acts as freely, as if there were no agent concerned
   but himself; and his exercises are as virtuous and holy; and it is
   really and as much his own virtue and holiness, and he is as excellent
   and praise-worthy, as if he did not depend on divine influences for
   these exercises; and they were not the effect of the operation of God.
   All this, it is presumed, is plain, and must be evident to all who have
   attended to what has been said above, on this subject. And there can be
   no difficulty respecting God's hardening the sinner's heart, and his
   hardening his own heart, which does not equally attend God's making a
   new and clean heart, and at the same time the man renewing and
   cleansing his own heart; and no objection can be made against the
   former, which is not as much against the latter: unless it be, that in
   the latter instance, moral good or holiness in the creature is the
   effect of the divine operation: but in the former, it is directly the
   reverse, and moral evil or sin takes place in consequence of the divine
   determination and agency; which has been thought by many to be
   inconsistent with the infinite purity and holiness of God. It is
   presumed that what has been said above to this point, is sufficient to
   obviate this objection, and show it to be wholly without foundation.
   But this leads to another observation.

   6. Though it be as expressly asserted in the scriptures which have been
   cited, and particularly considered, that God has determined the
   existence of all the moral evil that takes place, and does by his own
   operation and agency cause it to take place, as it does; as it is, that
   true virtue and holiness which takes place in men, is the effect of
   divine operation: Yet it does not follow from this, that the manner and
   mode of divine operation, which is the cause of those different and
   opposite effects, is in all respects the same; and consequently no man
   has a right to assert this. Indeed, this, in both instances, is
   inscrutable by man, and cannot be particularly explained. We know that
   what is produced in the latter instance, is, as it consists in the
   exercises of the creature, conformable to the law and nature of God. In
   the former, what takes place in man, is directly the reverse, contrary
   to God's nature and law: But as to the manner of operation, as the
   cause of either, we are wholly in the dark; as much as we are, with
   respect to the manner of the divine operation in the creation of the
   world, and the different and various existences. All we know is, that
   God willed their existence, to be just as they do exist, or said, Let
   them be, with which fiat their existence is infallibly connected. And
   he as really willed the existence of moral evil as of holiness in
   creatures; and the existence of both is equally the infallible
   consequence.

   And though the effects, holiness and sin, are in their nature, and
   considered in themselves, so infinitely different and contrary to each
   other, and the latter most odious and abominable; yet the existence of
   them both may be equally important and desirable, and necessary for the
   glory of God, and the greatest possible good: And in this view God
   willed the existence of both, in the exercise of infinite wisdom and
   benevolence, even the same kind of benevolence which he requires of
   creatures in his holy law; and which is opposed by the sinner in every
   act of sin. It hence appears, that God's disposition and will
   respecting the existence of sin, which is the origin and cause of it,
   and his disposition and w ill revealed in his law requiring
   benevolence, and all that is implied in it, and forbidding the
   contrary, are perfectly consistent, and one and the same: And were it
   possible for him to will and choose that sin should not exist, this
   would have been infinitely contrary to the divine law. Thus it appears
   that God is holy in all his works and ways, even while he wills the
   existence of moral evil: And that there neither is, nor possibly can
   be, any moral evil, in being thus the origin and cause of it.

   The following questions and answers will conclude this subject.

   Question. Does not the doctrine which has been advanced, serve to
   strengthen and confirm the infidel, and others, in their belief that
   man is not a moral agent, and is not capable of sin or blame, whatever
   he may do? Many who reject divine revelation profess to believe the
   doctrine of universal necessity; that all things and events, from the
   greatest to the least, are fixed, so that there can be no alteration:
   And hence they infer, that man has no liberty, and is not a moral
   agent, so as to be in any degree criminal. And many who do not
   professedly renounce revelation profess to believe the absolute and
   universal dependence of all creatures and things on God; and hence
   infer and say, they are what God has made them to be; therefore they
   are not answerable for what they are, or do; nor are they justly
   blameable for any thing in their character or conduct. These will think
   themselves supported by the doctrine of the decrees of God, as it has
   been stated above. Is it wise or right to advance a doctrine which
   tends to produce such an evil effect? Had it not better be suppressed,
   if it: be true.

   Answer 1. If the doctrine, as it has now been stated, be clearly and
   abundantly asserted in the scripture; and the whole be necessarily
   implied in the independence and supremacy of God, and the entire
   dependence of the creature, in all respects, which, it is presumed, has
   been made evident; then there can be no good reason why it should not
   be asserted and vindicated: And it is certain it does not tend to any
   evil, or to produce any bad effect. And if it be improved to any bad
   purpose, and any groundless inference be made from it, it must be an
   abuse of the truth, and perverting it to an end to which it has no
   tendency; but the contrary.

   Ans. 2. There is no religious or moral truth revealed in the Bible,
   which may not be improved to some bad purpose; and has not been so
   improved by ignorant and wicked men. And if no truth ought to be
   explained and vindicated, or mentioned, which may be abused, and will
   be perverted by some, even to their own destruction, all religious
   truth must be suppressed, and the Bible must be shut up, and no more
   lie open to the world.

   Ans. 3. At the same time that the doctrine of the divine decrees has
   been stated and vindicated, it has been equally proved from scripture
   and reason, that man is a free agent, and accountable for his moral
   conduct; and in all respects as much so, and is as real and as much a
   moral agent, as he could be on any supposition, and if this doctrine
   were not true; and no events or actions were fixed and certain before
   they actually took place: And he is as much the former and author of
   his own moral character, as he could be, were there no other agent
   concerned in them: And all his moral actions are as much his own, and
   his own virtue or sins, as they could be, if nothing were previously
   done or determined, which rendered them certain. If any will abuse
   their own reason and the holy scriptures, so much as to believe but one
   of these equally evident truths, and reject the other, he must answer
   for it, and take the consequence. But must one or the other of them be
   given up or suppressed, lest men should abuse one, or both of them? Let
   the scripture and reason judge.

   Ans. 4. All the difficulty in this matter appears to lie in reconciling
   the total, universal, and constant dependence of man on God, with his
   freedom and moral agency, and accountableness for his moral conduct.
   The scripture asserts both these in the strongest manner, from the
   beginning to the end, in a variety of ways. The instances are too
   numerous to be all mentioned here. This dependence is represented by
   the potter and the clay; and man is asserted to be as dependant on God
   for the manner of his existence, and in all his moral character and
   actions, as the clay is on the potter, for the shape, and kind of
   vessel into which it is to be formed. [140] And wicked men, in all
   their actions, are represented to be as much in the hand of God, and
   moved by him, as the saw, axe, rod or staff, are in the hand or power
   of a man, who uses and moves them. [141] The apostle Paul says, [142]
   "In him we live, and move, and have our being." [143]

   And reason, or true philosophy, teaches the same. A creature cannot be
   made independent, in any the least degree or respect whatever; because
   this implies a contradiction. For if a creature can be independent with
   respect to any thing, or in any degree, he ma} be so in every degree,
   and in all respects; which is inconsistent with his being a creature.
   Therefore the constant and entire dependence of man, on God, his
   Creator, for existence; for every perception and thought, and every
   motion of body or mind, and every circumstance of these, from the least
   that is possible, to the greatest, is absolute and perfect, in the
   highest degree, and in every respect. According to scripture and right
   reason, this is perfectly consistent with the moral freedom and agency
   of man; and he is as virtuous or vicious, and as worthy of praise, or
   deserving of blame and punishment, as if he were not thus dependent, if
   this were possible; which it is hoped has been made evident. But
   apostate, proud man feels as if he were, in a great degree at least,
   self dependent, and inclines and aspires to be so. This tends to lead
   him to wrong ideas and speculations on this point, and to prevent his
   reasoning properly upon it. And it is no wonder that great mistakes are
   made, and that many are led aside by false reasoning on the subject;
   and cannot be convinced of the truth: Or if they be in some measure
   convinced in their judgment, or at least silenced by unanswerable
   arguments; yet they may feel as if it were not, and could not be true;
   and not submit to it, but oppose it in all the exercises of their
   hearts.

   They who are humble, and feel their dependence on God, and are pleased
   with it, are most likely to understand these things, and to see the
   consistence of such dependence, and their freedom and accountableness
   to God for their moral conduct; and to be satisfied with it. And if
   they cannot remove every difficulty in speculation, and answer all the
   objections which are made to it; they nevertheless do acquiesce, and
   are pleased with being thus dependent, and yet wholly blameable for
   every deviation from the law of God; and have no doubt of the
   consistence of these, though they may not be able to show how, or to
   reason the matter out with others. "The meek will he guide in judgment;
   and the meek will he teach his way." [144] They will approve of the
   sentiments and exhortation of the apostle Paul, and feel and act
   accordingly. They will "work out their own salvation with fear and
   trembling;" that is, in the exercise of true humility, and a sense and
   acknowledgment of their entire, constant dependence on God for every
   exertion and motion of their will; knowing that "He worketh in them
   both to will and to do."

   Ques. Do not the words of the apostle James expressly deny that the
   divine agency is concerned in the existence of moral evil, when he
   says, "Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. For God
   cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man?"

   Ans. To tempt, and be tempted, are to be understood in different
   senses, as they are used in the scripture. God is said to be tempted,
   and men are often said to tempt him. And it is said that he tempted
   Abraham: And in this sense he does tempt others, and may tempt all men.
   Sometimes to tempt, is taken in a bad sense, as it is in this passage,
   and means a sinful act, as it always does when Satan is said to tempt
   any one. In this sense God does not tempt any man; for he is holy in
   all his works. To be tempted, sometimes means only to be tried; and is
   consistent with the perfect innocence and holiness of him who is said
   to be tempted. In this sense God is said to be tempted, and Jesus
   Christ was tempted. Sometimes to be tempted implies moral evil, and
   actually filling into sin. In this sense, the word seems to be used in
   the following passages, "Considering thyself, lest thou also be
   tempted. Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our
   labour be in vain." [145] In this sense the word is to be understood,
   when James says, "God cannot be tempted," and in the same sense he uses
   the word, when he speaks of a man being tempted. This is evident from
   his own explanation of it in the following words: "But every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed." A man
   cannot be tempted, in this sense, but by the exercise and gratification
   of his own lusts; the existence of which is therefore supposed, and
   necessary, in order to his being tempted; without which he could not be
   so tempted. Therefore a man is not, nor can be tempted, in the sense
   here stated, by any thing that is, or can be done, antecedent to the
   existence of evil, or lust, in his heart. For the temptation applies to
   his lust, and is suited to excite sinful exercises, or lead men into
   sin. It is easy to see, that God does not so tempt any man; and that
   his foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass, and executing his decrees
   in ordering and governing all the actions of men, does not imply this.
   All that God does is infinitely wise and holy. And he does not exhibit
   any thing to the view of men, or set any thing before them, in his word
   or works, in false colours, or that has any tendency to deceive them,
   or draw them into sin; but every thing which he suggests to them, in
   his word and providence, has a contrary tendency, and is perfect truth.
   And if men view objects in a wrong and false light, it is wholly owing
   to their lusts, by which the light and truth which God sets before
   them, is perverted and abused.

   Ques. Have not those who have been called Calvinists, and have
   professed their belief of the doctrine of the decrees of God, that he
   hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, denied the divine agency in
   the existence of moral evil, while they hold that God decreed to permit
   it? And is not this way of representing the matter safest and best, to
   avoid the charge of making God the author of sin? And others who hold
   that God is the cause of every act and volition of the sinner, have
   distinguished, and said that he is the cause of them, as natural
   actions and events, or so far as they are natural; but not of the moral
   depravity of them: That this is wholly from the sinner, and he alone is
   the cause of it? Is not this distinction proper and necessary, in order
   to avoid the above imputation?

   Ans. 1. It has been observed, that Calvin, and the assembly of divines,
   at Westminster, assert that the divine decree and agency, respecting
   the existence of sin, imply more than a bare permission, viz. something
   positive and efficacious. [146] They therefore who hold to only a bare
   permission, do depart from those who have been properly called
   Calvinists; and do not agree with the confession of faith composed by
   said Assembly of divines, or with those numerous churches and divines,
   who do assent, or have assented to that confession of faith, in
   England, Scotland, Ireland and America.

   Ans. 2. If by God's permitting sin, be meant, that sin will exist, if
   God do not interpose and hinder the existence of it by a positive
   exertion; and he only forbears such exertion, and suffers it to take
   ])lace; this involves a real absurdity and impossibility, as it
   supposes sin to exist, without any proper cause, and wholly independent
   of the first cause. And if any one thing, or event, may come into
   existence, independent of the first cause, every existence may do so
   too , and there is no need of a first cause of all, and the being of
   God cannot be proved, from any existence which men behold. But if it
   did not involve this impossibility, and any should think such an
   inference not just, it does really remove no supposed difficulty with
   respect to making God the origin of sin: for if sin could not exist
   with out the will and decree of God to permit it, and nothing but a
   bare permission were necessary in order to its existence; yet God in
   determining to permit it, willed the existence of it; and this
   necessarily implies his choice and pleasure, that sin should exist, in
   every instance in which it does take place; and that he orders things
   so that, he permitting, it will certainly exist just as it does. And
   this implies the whole of the doctrine which has been advanced, as has
   been before observed. To decree to permit sin, in the case supposed, is
   to will the existence of it. And this is liable to all the objections
   which can be made to the doctrine which has been advanced in this
   chapter, as making God the author of sin, &c. And nothing worse, or
   more, can be said against this doctrine, as it has been stated above,
   which has not been said against the assertion, which has been espoused
   by all Calvinists, viz. That God has foreordained whatsoever comes to
   pass. This has always been loaded, by many, with the greatest
   opprobrium which they could invent, asserting that it is the most
   blasphemous, horrid doctrine, that was ever thought of, making God the
   sole author of all the sin in the world; and most unreasonable and
   cruel, in punishing men or devils, who, according to this doctrine, are
   perfectly innocent and incapable of sinning, &c. &c. And nothing will
   satisfy such objectors, but to give up the doctrine of the divine
   decrees, and admit man to be and act so as to form his own moral
   character, independent of God, and in every sense contrary to his
   purpose and will, if it be sinful.

   Ans. 3. The attempt to distinguish between the sinful volitions or
   actions of man, as natural and moral actions, and making God the origin
   and cause of them, considered as natural actions, and men the cause and
   authors of the depravity and sin which is in them, is, it is believed,
   unintelligible, and has no consistent or real meaning, and gives no
   rational satisfaction to the inquiring mind; unless by making this
   distinction it be meant, that in every sinful action, God is not the
   sinful cause of it; but all he determines and does respecting these, is
   the exercise of holiness: And all the moral depravity and sin consists
   in the volitions and actions of men, and is their sin, and cannot be
   ascribed to God; men being as much the cause and authors of their own
   sins, as they could be, if God had not done or determined any thing
   respecting them. And this is the doctrine which has been vindicated in
   this chapter. And is it not reasonable and candid to suppose that those
   worthy men who have made this distinction, did really mean no more nor
   less than this?

   On the whole, it is presumed there has nothing been advanced, as
   included in the doctrine of the decrees of God, which is not
   necessarily implied in his independence and supremacy, his infinite
   wisdom and goodness, or holiness; and man's necessary dependence on
   him; or that is inconsistent with the most perfect freedom of man, and
   his moral agency, and accountableness for all his moral exercises, and
   being justly blameable for every thing in him which is contrary to the
   holy law of God: And that, consistent with this doctrine, as much
   depends on the will and conduct of men, as if they were not dependent,
   if this were possible, and nothing had been done or determined,
   respecting their volitions and conduct, previous thereto: And that
   their will and conduct is as much their own, and is as deserving of
   praise or blame; is as virtuous or vicious, as it could be, were they
   wholly independent: And that there is nothing contained in this
   doctrine that makes God the author of sin, in any bad sense, and so as
   to impeach the divine holiness: And that all this has been made
   evident, But if the contrary can be made to appear, this doctrine, with
   all that is implied in it, shall be given up and renounced.

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. From what has been said on this high and important subject, may be
   inferred the truth and divine original of the holy scriptures; in that
   the doctrine of the divine decrees is clearly revealed, and so
   abundantly asserted therein; and the whole Bible is evidently formed on
   this plan. This doctrine is so agreeable to reason, and so essential to
   rational and consistent conceptions of the character and perfections,
   the infinite felicity, and absolute independence and supremacy and
   dominion of the Most High: and it is so desirable and important, that
   infinite wisdom and goodness should dictate, and form the plan of all
   existences and events; making one harmonious, absolutely perfect
   system; of all possible ones, the wisest and the best; that it might be
   reasonably expected a revelation from heaven would contain this
   doctrine in all its length and breadth, exhibiting it in a clear and
   incontestible light; and expressly or implicitly asserting the perfect
   consistency of it, with every truth respecting the divine character and
   conduct; and the liberty and moral agency of man.

   If this doctrine were not contained and asserted in divine revelation,
   it would be perfectly unaccountable: And if the holy scriptures were
   formed on a contrary plan, and in opposition to this doctrine, it would
   be an insuperable objection against them, as coming from God. But when
   the children of wisdom see this contained in the Bible, they approve
   and are satisfied, and discern the divine stamp, in this, as well as in
   other things; and a perfect harmony and consistence through the whole.

   It is true, that many have supposed that if this doctrine were in the
   Bible, it would be an unanswerable objection against the authenticity
   and divine original of it; and have thought they have been supporting
   the credit of divine revelation, by attempting to explain away those
   passages in which it is most expressly asserted, and to put another
   meaning upon them. But what has been gained by these attempts? Has one
   professed deist been hereby brought to think more favourably of the
   Bible, or to believe this doctrine is not contained in it? Not one
   instance of this, it is presumed, can be produced. And have not impiety
   and infidelity prevailed most, when and where the doctrine of the
   divine decrees, as above asserted and explained, has been most opposed
   and discarded?

   All professed deists see the doctrine of the divine decrees, and the
   fixed certainty of all events, plainly asserted in the Bible; and some
   of them dislike this doctrine, and make it an argument, that it is not
   a revelation from God. Others believe and embrace the doctrine, and
   hence infer, contrary to the scriptures, that there is no such thing as
   liberty, moral agency, virtue or vice: And therefore dislike and oppose
   divine revelation, as much as the other.

   But in the Bible the doctrine of the divine decrees, foreordaining
   whatsoever comes to pass; and the consistency of this with human
   liberty, moral agency, praise and blame, reward and punishment, is
   asserted; and he who well attends to this, will not only acquiesce and
   approve; but in discerning the beauty and harmony of these truths, he
   will have evidence in his own mind, that this is a revelation from God;
   as the corrupt heart of man, not guided by heavenly illumination, would
   not have represented the matter in this light. Thus what the wisdom of
   man, the wisdom of this world, calls folly, and rejects as such, the
   children of wisdom embrace as wiser than men, even the wisdom of God;
   and see and adore the finger of God in forming such a revelation.

   II. This view of the divine decrees and operations tends to enlarge the
   mind, in high and exalting thoughts of God, and leads to adore him as
   the first and the last, the Almighty, who worketh all things by the
   counsel of his own will, infinite in power and wisdom, doing what he
   pleases in heaven and on earth: And this view of the Deity tends to
   lead the mind of man to humbling views of himself, as absolutely
   dependent on God, in all respects, and as infinitely little and
   inconsiderable, in comparison with God; and to see the reasonableness
   and importance of being devoted to him, in seeking his glory as the
   supreme end. In this view, the words of St. Paul will be naturally
   suggested and espoused by the pious mind. "O the depth of the riches
   both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his ways,
   and his judgments past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the
   Lord, or who hath been his counsellor? Or who hath first given to him,
   and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through
   him, and to him, are all things: To whom be glory forever, Amen."

   III. This doctrine is the only foundation, and a sufficient and ample
   one, for the support, comfort and joy of the pious friends of God, in
   the midst of all the darkness, sin and misery that take place. "The
   Lord reigneth, let the people rejoice." Infinite wisdom and goodness,
   clothed with omnipotence, reign, and nothing takes place but what is
   important and necessary to accomplish the wisest and best end, the
   glory of God, and the greatest possible good. God will bring infinite
   good out of all the evil; and for this end he hath foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass. Was not this a most certain truth, and to be
   relied upon, the pious mind must sink in darkness, in the view of the
   evil that takes place, and could find no relief. But here is a source
   of comfort and joy, since all things are ordered in the wisest and best
   manner, nothing could be added, or taken away, without rendering the
   divine plan less wise, perfect, and excellent.

   It belongs to the infinitely wise, almighty maker and owner of all
   things, and governor of all worlds, to order every event; especially
   the events of the moral world, and the moral actions of creatures,
   which are the most important: They must be determined and fixed by
   something, by undesigning chance, or by ignorance or folly, or by
   infinite wisdom. He who is infinitely wise and almighty can do it in a
   way perfectly consistent with the liberty and moral agency of his
   creatures; and this being every way most desirable, and the contrary
   supposition infinitely dreadful: when the friends of God see this is
   done by him, and that his counsel with respect to every event, and all
   actions, stands forever, and the thoughts of his heart to all
   generations--they rest in this, and rejoice continually, and no man can
   take this comfort and joy from them. Though the earth be removed, or
   the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, whatever events,
   and however evil in themselves, take place; yet they will not fear, but
   drink consolation at this river, the streams whereof make glad the city
   of God. "Let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God; yea,
   let them exceedingly rejoice." [147]

   IV. This affords a solid stable foundation, for the most unreserved,
   implicit confidence and trust in God. He superintends in all things. He
   is in the heavens, and hath done whatsoever he pleased; he will
   accomplish his own ends, and cannot be disappointed. Therefore his
   friends may trust in him with the greatest assurance, that, whatever
   appearances there may be against it, he will accomplish his own ends,
   glorify himself, fulfil all his promises to his people, and make them
   most happy forever. "O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth
   in thee." Therefore,

   V. This doctrine is suited to promote true piety and holiness. For this
   consists in loving God, in trusting and rejoicing in him, and his
   government and works, acknowledging him in all our ways, in seeing his
   hand in all events, in submitting to him, and obeying him. This
   doctrine is so far from affording any just ground of encouragement to
   sin, that so far as it is understood and cordially embraced, it forms
   the heart to hate sin and love the law of God, and to the most hearty,
   cheerful submission to his government. Experience proves this to be
   true, and the reason of it is very obvious. For they who see and
   approve of the wisdom of God in making all things for himself, and
   ordering all things, even the sins of men, for his own glory; must
   themselves desire and seek the glory of God; and this necessarily
   implies an approbation of the law of God, and a cordial submission and
   obedience to it.

   VI. Hence may be inferred the propriety and importance of preaching
   this doctrine, and of explaining and vindicating it, as it is revealed
   in the holy scriptures.

   Some who believe it is revealed in the Bible, yet think it ought not to
   be preached, or spoken of, as it is such a mysterious doctrine, and is
   so difficult and puzzling to many, and a stumbling block to them,
   rather than to their edification; and is liable to be misimproved to
   bad purposes.

   But such must be under a great mistake. It is dishonourable to God, and
   to the Bible, to suppose any truth which he has there revealed, is of a
   bad tendency, and therefore ought not to be published; yea, it is
   implicitly denying that the Bible is from God, and taking sides with
   the deist. Besides, there is a contradiction and absurdity in the
   supposition, that it is a truth, and yet has a bad tendency; for this
   is impossible in the nature of things. That which has a bad tendency,
   is error and falsehood; but truth has a direct contrary tendency and
   effect, wherever it is received.

   It is true, this doctrine may be preached imprudently, it may be
   represented in a partial and improper light; and so that the hearers
   will not understand it. No one can be justified for preaching this, or
   any other truth, in such a manner. But this is rather a reason why it
   should, with all other important truths, be thoroughly and fully
   preached, so that they who are disposed to attend, and willing to
   understand, may have opportunity to be instructed. It is doubtless
   better, if there can be a better in the case, not to preach it at all,
   than to do it to the halves, just mentioning it sometimes; for this is
   not the way to have it understood, but tends to raise prejudices
   against it. But the best and only wise way is, to preach it, and
   explain it clearly and fully, and give persons opportunity, more
   privately, to propose any objections they may have, that they may be
   removed.

   And parents ought to be able and willing to teach it to their children;
   to explain it and show them the reason of it, and the evidence there is
   in the scripture of the truth of it. And though they might not fully
   understand it in early age; yet a foundation would be hereby laid for
   their making improvement in understanding, as they advance in years. It
   is not so difficult a doctrine, as many imagine, who perhaps never
   understood it themselves, through strong prejudices, which they
   imbibed, before they were well instructed in it. A child of twelve or
   fourteen years old, who is carefully instructed, and will attend, is
   capable of understanding and seeing the evidence and reasonableness of
   this doctrine; which must be believed as an important article of the
   christian faith, where the Bible is well understood; however it be now,
   and has been, rejected by many, with the greatest contempt, boldness
   and assurance.

   [63] The point has been more particularly, and with greater care and
   exactness, considered and examined in the light of both reason and
   revelation, by the late President Edwards, than by any other author, in
   his Dissertation concerning the End for which God created the world.
   The reader, who desires to see this subject more fully explained and
   explored, must be referred to that ingenious, elaborate performance.

   [64] Acts xxvii.

   [65] It is to be observed, and kept in mind, in attending to what is
   here said on human liberty, that every degree of active inclination and
   moral exercise of heart, is included in willing and choosing, as well
   as what are called the imperate and overt acts of the will: For such
   inclination or exercise of heart, in every degree and instance of it,
   is not distinguishable from exercise of will and choice; but is really
   the same thing.

   [66] It is therefore certain that man is perfectly free, or has all the
   freedom that in the nature of things is possible, in the exercise of
   will and choice, or in acting voluntarily; and God, in forming man a
   voluntary agent, made him a free moral agent, and he cannot be deprived
   of this freedom and moral agency, unless he be made to cease from
   acting from motive, and exercising will and choice.

   [67] It was thought proper and necessary briefly to consider in what
   liberty and moral agency consist, in order to determine, whether real
   liberty be consistent with the absolute previous certainty of all
   events and actions, implied in the doctrine of God's decrees. But the
   subject is by no means exhausted here; nor is there need of it, since
   it has been more particularly and fully considered by those able
   writers. President Edwards, in his careful and strict inquiry into the
   modern, prevailing notions of that freedom of will, which is supposed
   to be essential to moral agency, virtue and vice, reward and
   punishment, praise and blame. And Mr. West, in his Essay on moral
   agency. The reader who desires to see a more thorough and clear
   discussion of this point, is with pleasure referred to those
   performances, where he will, it is presumed, find abundant
   satisfaction.

   [68] "Sin, in its own nature, hath no tendency to good, it is not an
   apt medium, hath no proper efficacy to promote the glory of God: So far
   is it from a direct contributing to it, that, on the contrary, it is
   most real dishonour to him. But as a black ground in a picture, which
   in itself only defiles, when placed by art, sets off the brighter
   colours, and brightens their beauty; so the evil of sin, which,
   considered absolutely, obscures the glory of God; yet, by the
   overruling disposition of his Providence, it serves to illustrate his
   name, and make it more glorious in the esteem of creatures. Without the
   sin of man, there had been no place for the most perfect exercise of
   his goodness." Bates, on the Harmony of the Divine Attributes, Edit.
   iii. p. 81

   [69] If any one desires to see this subject more particularly and
   accurately considered, he must be referred to Mr. West's Essay on Moral
   Agency.

   [70] There have been many objections to what has been here asserted and
   proved, viz. That sin is necessary in order to the greatest good of the
   whole, and is the occasion of good in every instance of it. It has been
   said, that such a position gives the greatest encouragement to sin; for
   the more sin there is, the better, the more good there will be--That
   sin, according to this, is really no crime--That this is therefore
   inconsistent with its being forbidden in the law of God, and the
   punishment of the sinner, &c.--The distinction which has been made
   between sin, considered in itself, in its own nature and tendency; and
   as it is connected with the whole, and as overruled and used by God for
   the greatest good of the universe, is sufficient, it is supposed, if
   well considered, to show how groundless such objections are. All sin is
   infinitely odious, in its own nature, and has the most evil tendency,
   as it consists in opposition to God, and his glory, and to all good;
   God's law, therefore, which requires love to him, must condemn and
   forbid sin, as infinitely wrong, and odious to him. The sinner cannot
   take encouragement to sin, from the good of which God makes it the
   occasion; because this is no good to him, so far as he is inclined to
   sin; and therefore cannot be a motive to sin: Because it is directly
   crossing to all inclination to sin. A son who desires not his fathers
   honour, but is of a disposition to be gratified in his disgrace, could
   not be persuaded to rebel against his father, from the consideration
   that his father would get honour by it: But if he be a friend to his
   father, and to his honour, he will not, from this friendship, be
   induced to act like an enemy, and do that which tends to hurt and
   dishonour him. Therefore man never did do evil with a desire and design
   to promote the good of which God makes it the occasion, it being a
   contradiction, and therefore absolutely impossible. And as rebellion
   against God is as evil in its own nature and tendency, when God makes
   it the occasion of good, and the disposition, views and motives of the
   sinner are as vile and criminal, as if no good, but infinite evil were
   the consequence, the sinner is as blameworthy, and deserves punishment
   as much, as if no good, but all the evil which his sin tends to
   produce, took place. It is not thought necessary or proper to give a
   more particular answer to these objections here. This has been done in
   three sermons, on the subject of the good of which sin is the occasion,
   published in the year 1759, and reprinted in Boston, and at Edinburgh
   in Scotland, in 1773.

   [71] "If by the author of sin is meant the permitter, or a not hinderer
   of sin: and at the same time, a disposer of the state of events, in
   such a manner, for wise, holy, and most excellent ends and purposes,
   that sin infallibly follows; I say, if this be all that is meant, by
   being the author of sin, I do not deny that God is the author of sin,
   (tho' I dislike and reject the phrase, as that which, by use and
   custom, is apt to carry another sense) It is no reproach for the Most
   High to be thus the author of sin. This is not to be the actor of sin,
   but on the contrary, of holiness. What God doth herein, is holy; and
   the glorious exercise of the infinite excellency of his nature And I do
   not deny, that God's being thus the author of sin, follows from what I
   have laid down: And I assert that it equally follows from the doctrine
   which is maintained by most of the Arminian divines." Edwards, on
   Freedom of Will. Edit. I. Part iv. S. xi. P. 254. "If it would be a
   plain defect of wisdom and goodness in a being, not to choose that
   should be, which he certainly knows it would, all things considered, be
   best should be, (as has but now been observed) then it must be
   impossible for a Being who has no defect of wisdom and goodness, to do
   any otherwise than choose it should be; and that for this very reason,
   because he is perfectly wise and good. And if it be agreeable to
   perfect wisdom and goodness for him to choose that it should be, and
   the ordering of all things supremely and perfectly belongs to him, it
   must be agreeable to infinite wisdom and goodness, to order that it
   should be. If the choice be good, the ordering and disposing things
   according to that choice must also be good. It can be no harm in one to
   whom it belongs to do his will in the armies of heaven, and among the
   inhabitants of the earth, to execute a good volition If the will be
   good, and the object of his will be, all things considered, good and
   best; then the choosing or willing it, is not willing evil. And if so,
   then his ordering according to that will, is not doing evil?" Idem. P.
   267. It may be proper to observe here, that all which has been above
   asserted respecting the origin and cause of moral evil, is contained
   and fully expressed in the following words, in the Shorter Catechism.
   "The decrees of God are, his eternal purpose, according to the counsel
   of his own will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass. God executeth his decrees in his works of
   creation and providence. God's works of providence are, his most holy,
   wise and powerful preserving and governing all his creatures, and all
   their actions." And in their confession of faith, they say, "God, the
   great creator of all things, doth uphold, direct, dispose and govern
   all creatures, actions and things, from the greatest even to the least,
   by his most wise and holy providence, according to his infallible
   foreknowledge, and the free and immutable counsel of his own will, to
   the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and
   mercy. "The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness
   of God, so fur manifest themselves in his providence; that it extendeth
   itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men,
   and that not by a bare permission, but such as hath joined with it a
   most wise and powerful bounding, and otherwise ordering, and governing
   them, in a manifold dispensation, to his own holy ends." It is here
   asserted that God hath foreordained, decreed and willed the existence
   of moral evil; for this has come to pass. And it is said God brings
   this decree or will of his into effect, by creation and his governing
   providence, by which he, in the exercise of wisdom and holiness, does
   powerfully govern his creatures, and superintend and direct, dispose
   and order all their actions. These assertions, which have been justly
   considered as essential to what has been called Calvinism, and are
   professed and espoused by all consistent Calvinists, have been strongly
   objected to by many, ever since they have been made and published, as
   full of impiety, and involving horrible consequences, making God the
   author of sin, &c. It is therefore no wonder, when this same doctrine
   is revived, explained and vindicated, that the same objections should
   come into view, and be urged, as they have been heretofore. This is
   observed, with a view to rectify a mistake which some seem to imbibe,
   while they oppose the doctrine above asserted, respecting the origin
   and cause of moral evil: and yet do not consider or believe they are
   equally opposing the Assembly of Divines, and all who have espoused the
   confession of faith and the catechism composed by them; and not as a
   proof of the truth of the doctrine; for it is presumed this has been
   exhibited in what has been said above; and will be yet farther
   confirmed b/ what is to follow; and needs not the testimony of man for
   its support.

   [126] The Magians began first in Persia, and there, and in India, were
   the only places where this sect was propagated, and there they remain
   unto this day. Their chief doctrine was, that there were two
   principles, one of which was the cause of all good, and the other the
   cause of all evil. That the former is represented by light, and the
   other by darkness, as their truest symbols, and that of the composition
   of these two, all things in the world are made. Therefore when Xerxes
   prayed for that evil upon his enemies, that it might be put into the
   minds of all of them to drive their best and bravest men from them, as
   the Athenians had Themistocles, he addressed his prayer to the evil god
   of the Persians, and not to their good god. The good god they always
   worshipped before the fire, as being the cause of light, and especially
   before the sun, as being in their opinion the perfectest fire, and
   causing the perfectest light Isaiah xlv. 5, 6, 7. "I am the Lord, and
   there is none else; there is no God besides me; I girded thee, though
   thou hast not known me, that they may know from the rising of the sun,
   and from the west, that there is none besides me. I form light and
   create darkness, I make peace and create evil. I the Lord do all these
   things." These words, being directed to Cyrus king of Persia, must be
   understood as spoken in reference to the Persian sect of the Magians,
   who then held light and darkness, or good and evil, to be the supreme
   beings." Dr. Prideaux Connection, 9 Edit. p. 252, 253, 304.

   we use the language which God has taught." Doddridge's Note on Luke
   xxii. 22.

   [132] Calvin represents those as very unreasonable, and perverting the
   scriptures, who insist that no more is meant than a bare permission,
   when God is said to harden the hearts of men, shut their eyes, &c. He
   speaks of them as frigidi speculatores, diluti moderatores; to whose
   delicate ears such .scripture expressions seem harsh, and are
   offensive. They therefore, he observes, soften them down, by turning an
   action into a permission, as if there were no difference between acting
   and suffering, i.e. suffering others to act. He says, such who will
   admit of a permission only, suspend the counsel and determination of
   God, wholly on the will of man. But that he is not ashamed or afraid to
   speak as the Holy Spirit does: And does not hesitate to approve and
   embrace what the scripture so often declares, viz. That God blinds the
   minds of wicked men, and hardens thei4 hearts, &c. See Calvin's
   Commentary on Exodus iv 21. vii. 3.--Joshua ix. 20--Rom. ix. 18. See
   also West's Essay on Moral Agency, page 241, 246. When the apostle Paul
   says, "And whom he will he hardeneth," he. refers to the words of God,
   when he repeatedly says to Moses, that he would, and actually did
   harden the heart of Pharaoh: And he does not attempt to soften or alter
   the expression in the least, when he applies it to all who are
   hardened.

CHAP. V.

  CONCERNING THE CREATION OF THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY OF MAN.

   GOD began to execute his infinitely wise and good plan, which he had
   formed and fixed, by his unchangeable purpose and decree, in the work
   of creation. "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
   Heaven and earth comprehend the whole creation, both that which is
   visible, and invisible, to man.

   This is said to be in the beginning, to denote that creation, or every
   thing that is created, had a beginning, in opposition to being eternal,
   or without a beginning; and because time and succession of existence
   then began; there being no other beginning of existence but this, and
   therefore no beginning before this, there being nothing before
   creation, but the Creator, whose existence is without beginning.

   The creation is great, extensive and manifold, and vastly exceeds our
   knowledge and comprehension: But God spake the whole into existence,
   from nothing, with infinite ease. He said, "Let it be, and it was. He
   spake, and it was done: He commanded, and it stood fast." The invisible
   heaven, which probably is intended when St. Paul speaks of the Third
   Heaven, and is called by Solomon, "The heaven of heavens," was in this
   beginning created, and formed for the peculiar residence of God, who is
   said to have established his throne in the heavens, to be and dwell
   there; and the place where angels dwell; their creation being
   comprehended in the creation of heaven. And this is the heaven to which
   the redeemed will be received after the day of judgment, which our
   Saviour says, was "prepared for them from the foundation of the world."
   This heaven and the angels were created then; but before this lower
   world was formed, and brought into order. Therefore it is represented
   by God, that when he created this earth, the angels were spectators of
   the work; for these are the morning stars, and the sons of God, who are
   said to sing together and shout for joy, when the earth was formed.
   [148] God was pleased to create innumerable hosts of intelligent
   beings, with strong powers of mind, and large capacities, to be
   spectators of his works, and attend to the numerous worlds and
   creatures, as they rose into existence and order; and behold and admire
   infinite power, wisdom and goodness, manifested herein, and rejoice,
   adore and praise the Creator.

   We have no knowledge of the existence of any other rational creatures
   besides angels and men: and therefore we have no reason to conclude
   there are any other. Men may suppose there are many other ranks or
   kinds of rational creatures; but this, at most, is but mere conjecture.
   The supposition that there are no more, seems to have a more solid
   foundation, viz. that divine revelation makes no mention of any such;
   which it is reasonable to suppose it would, if there were any; since
   all rational creatures, under the same moral government, must have some
   connection and concern with each other.

   The angels are often brought into view in the holy scriptures; and they
   are represented as having a particular concern and interest in the
   future general judgment: Were there any other moral agents, they would
   have ah equal concern in this judgment, and be members of the same
   society and kingdom of God, with the holy angels, and the redeemed from
   among men, or share in the punishment of the wicked: therefore, it is
   reasonable to suppose their existence, and some circumstances relating
   to them, would have been revealed, had there been any such creatures.
   The silence of the scriptures on this head is a sufficient reason to
   conclude, that angels and men are the only moral agents in the created
   universe; or, at least, not to conclude there are any such, and to be
   silent about them.

   If it should be said, that the supposition of innumerable ranks of
   rational creatures, beside angels and men, represents God's moral
   kingdom vastly more grand and glorious, than if there were none but the
   latter: It may be observed, that we are not competent judges of the
   number which will best answer the ends of infinite wisdom. There must
   be some bounds set to the number of rational creatures; and how many
   soever are included in this number, there would be equal reason to
   suppose it would be better, and render the kingdom of God still more
   grand a: id glorious, to have innumerable myriads added to the number,
   as there is to suppose it would be better there should be more than
   angels and men. Therefore there is certainly no reason for such a
   supposition.

   There are "an innumerable company of angels," even when numbers, beyond
   our reckoning or conception, are left in sin and ruin. And who can have
   any adequate conception of the number of the human race, including all
   who have existed, and all who shall yet exist, before the end of the
   world! No man has any reason to think or suppose, that this number of
   intelligent moral agents, far beyond his conception, is not exactly
   sufficient, in the view of him whose understanding and wisdom are
   infinite, to answer all the ends of his moral government, and to render
   his eternal kingdom most complete, happy and glorious.

   The number and magnitude of the various bodies, worlds and systems in
   the material universe, which we behold, or can imagine, do not render
   it certain, or in the least degree probable, that they are all, or any
   of them, inhabited by rational creatures. If we were certain that the
   fixed stars are all like the sun in our system, which give light and
   heat to as many vast bodies or worlds, as our sun does, and no more:
   and that there are innumerable stars or suns, of this kind, invisible
   to us; yet all these, and as many more as the most enlarged mind can
   imagine, may be no more, nor greater, than is proper and necessary to
   answer the ends, which infinite wisdom has in view, with respect to
   angels and men. It is certain no man can determine they are not all
   necessary to answer the best ends, though there be no other ranks of
   rational creatures.

   God was able, and could as easily create the whole world, and all
   creatures and things therein, and put them in the best form, and most
   perfect order at once, in the first moment of their existence, as to do
   it gradually, and by a progressive work; but the writings of Moses
   inform us, that he was pleased to be six days in creating the world,
   and finishing this stupendous work: And we are particularly told, in
   what manner and order this work was carried on, until the whole was
   finished. We may be sure there were wise and important ends to be
   answered, by creating in this manner, and taking up the time of six
   days, and no more, in this work, though we were not able to discover or
   imagine what they are. But we are not left wholly in the dark, with
   respect to this. It is evident from scripture, that the natural world
   is so adapted to the moral, that the former is a representation or
   emblem of the latter; and that there is a designed analogy of the
   natural to the moral. This appears in that, in innumerable instances,
   reference is had to things in the natural world, and use is made of
   them, to represent and illustrate those of a moral kind, in the holy
   scriptures.

   The darkness and chaotic state in which the materials of which the
   world was to be made, lay and were found: it being tohu bohu, without
   form and void, or emptiness, confusion and vanity, is a striking emblem
   of the moral state in which man is found, as the subject of redemption,
   from which a most perfect, beautiful and glorious kingdom is to be
   formed; which is therefore called a new creation, the new heavens and
   the new earth. Mankind are, in consequence of the first apostasy, m a
   state of moral confusion, disorder and darkness; of total ruin,
   emptiness and vanity. Redemption or the new creation, the kingdom of
   Christ, is formed out of these materials; and, when brought to
   perfection, will be a most bright and glorious monument of infinite
   power, wisdom, and goodness: and will so vastly exceed the first
   creation in importance, duration, worth, beauty and glory, that the
   former work will be forgotten, and not be worthy of mention, in
   comparison with the latter. This is the representation given of ii in
   the scriptures, particularly by the prophet Isaiah. [149] "Behold, I
   create new heavens, and a new earth: And the former shall not be
   remembered, nor come into the mind. But be you glad, and rejoice
   forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a
   rejoicing, and her people a joy." This is farther explained by the
   apostles, Peter and John. [150] Peter, speaking of the dissolution of
   the old or first heavens and earth, says, "Nevertheless we, according
   to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness." By the last words he fixes his meaning of new heavens
   and a new earth. It is that society or moral kingdom, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness: That is, the holy church and kingdom of Christ,
   consisting in moral excellency, righteousness, or holiness. John says,
   "I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: For the first heaven, and the
   first earth were passed away." He then proceeds to describe the new
   heaven, and the new earth: "And I, John, saw the holy city, new
   Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
   adorned for her husband." This is the new heaven and the new earth,
   even the new Jerusalem, the holy city, wherein dwelleth righteousness,
   that is, the church and kingdom of Christ, formed out of the moral
   chaos of disorder, confusion and darkness, in which he found mankind;
   and adorned with righteousness or true holiness. None who attend can be
   insensible, that this passage is parallel with that in Isaiah, quoted
   above; and explains the meaning of the new heavens, and new earth, and
   of Jerusalem, mentioned there. In both places, Jerusalem and the new
   heavens and new earth are evidently put for the same thing; and the new
   Jerusalem is certainly the church of Christ, or the work of redemption,
   with all the appendages of it.

   The gradual increase and advance of light and order, in creating and
   forming the natural material world, is analogous to the increase of
   light and order in the moral world, particularly in the work of
   redemption, and an emblem of it. This light began to dawn directly
   after the fall of man, and has been increasing ever since; and will
   continue to increase, till the Sun of righteousness, (the sun of the
   moral world, the Lord and Saviour, who is the light of the world, and
   of whom the natural sun is an emblem) shall arise, upon all nations,
   with healing in his beams; and the earth shall be full of the knowledge
   of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea; when the church shall arise,
   and put on her morally beautiful garments, and shine in the beauty of
   holiness. And the darkness in the natural world, preceding light, and
   night preceding day, is a representation of what takes place in the
   church, and will in some degree continue, till the consummation of all
   things. Darkness, affliction and trouble, the fruit of the original
   universal moral disorder, do take place in a sort of periodical
   succession, which is followed with a greater or less degree of light,
   peace and comfort; until all evil shall be banished from the church
   forever, and there shall be no more night there.

   As God was six days in forming the natural world, in bringing it into
   the order which he designed, and furnishing it with the various sorts
   of inhabitants; and then rested on the seventh day: this was a designed
   emblem of the moral world, or of redemption, pointing out the length of
   time that it would take to bring that to such a state of order and
   beauty as was intended, a day being put for the period of a thousand
   years. During the space of six thousand years Christ is carrying on the
   work of redemption, and forming his church and kingdom, out of the
   chaotic mass of mankind, to a state of order and beauty, through
   various revolutions and conflicts; when it shall be brought to a state
   of rest and peace; and the seventh thousand years of the world shall be
   a day of rest, when "the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
   kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the
   saints of the Most High;" and the church shall put on her beautiful
   garments, prepared as a bride is adorned for her husband: And the Lord
   her God will rejoice over her with joy: He will rest in his love, and
   will joy over her with singing.

   Moreover, by working six days, and resting from his work on the
   seventh, and consequently sanctifying that, and setting it apart as a
   day of rest for man, he set an example, and made an institution for
   man, which was useful, important and necessary, for the best good of
   man, and the promotion of his designs respecting his moral kingdom.
   [151]

   According to the scriptures, there have not yet been six thousand years
   since the creation. And there are a variety of facts and arguments
   which prove the world cannot be much older than it is represented to be
   in sacred history: which have been mentioned by many writers: And there
   are no appearances or facts, which give the least evidence of the
   contrary.

   It has been asked, Why the world was not created sooner? Why it would
   not have been wiser an d better, to have had it created so much sooner,
   or be fore it was created, as to have every thing ready for the day of
   judgment by this time; yea, so as to have had all the blessed in the
   enjoyment of complete happiness for millions of ages already? For this
   would have been so much clear gain of happiness, which is really lost,
   and never can be enjoyed, because the world was created so late.

   It may be observed upon this, in the first place, that this question
   can never be satisfied, so that it might not still be asked with as
   much reason and propriety, as it is now asked; and therefore it must be
   an improper and unreasonable question. If the world had now existed ten
   thousand ages instead of six thousand years; and were this possible,
   still the question might be asked, with as much apparent reason as now.
   Why it had not been created so early, as now to have existed ten
   millions of ages instead of ten thousand? And so on without end. That
   question or demand, which in the nature of things cannot be answered or
   satisfied, on any supposition whatsoever, is unreasonable, and ought
   never to be made.

   In the second place, This question is inconsistent and absurd, and can
   really have no meaning. Antecedent to the beginning of time there could
   be no succession from one minute or hour to another; for minutes and
   hours relate only to time. There was no before or after, sooner or
   later. Antecedent to the creation of the world, there was no existence
   but the Creator, who only exists without beginning to exist, and
   therefore without succession. There is no such thing, or idea, to
   answer the words, before or after, sooner or later, with respect to him
   and his existence. These are relative terms, and denote ideas that
   relate to time; and therefore cannot be used with propriety, to denote
   any thing antecedent to creation; because no such thing can be
   predicated of absolute eternity, which has no relation to time, and
   succession. Therefore it may be with truth asserted, that the world
   could not be created sooner than it was, or before it was actually
   created. Because there was no succession, and therefore nothing sooner
   or later, before or after, antecedent to creation.

   And when it is asked. Why the world was not created so early, that from
   the creation to the present time, as many millions of years should have
   passed, as there have thousands? There is an impropriety in the
   question, in the use of the word early, because there was no such thing
   as early or late, antecedent to the creation, and therefore this is
   altogether inapplicable to eternity, and is a word, when used in this
   case, without any idea or meaning, or if any idea be affixed to it, or
   conveyed by it, it is a false and delusive one, or not agreeable to the
   truth, as has been just before proved. But, if the word early were
   allowed to be proper, it may upon this be observed, that the world
   could not be created so soon, or so early, but that there must be a
   time, when there have been just so many years from the creation, to
   that time, as there have actually been since the world was created, to
   this time. And whenever that time had come, and the world had been
   created but six thousand years, the question might be asked. Why the
   world was not created before, so that millions of years should have
   passed by that time, instead of six thousand? And on that supposition,
   this question would be as proper and reasonable, as it is now. And
   therefore it may be always asked, and never can be satisfied:
   Consequently is an unreasonable, absurd question, as has been shown.

   Besides, the querist may be asked, since, though the world were created
   ever so early, even as soon as it was possible it could be created; yet
   there must be a time when it had existed just so many years, as it has
   now actually existed; how does he know, that he does not live in that
   very time, and that the world was created as early as his question
   demands; yea, as soon as it could be created, and have a beginning?

   He who attends to this will doubtless perceive how unreasonable and
   absurd it is to suppose that the creation might have been sooner or
   later, or that there might now have been more or a less number of years
   since the creation, than there have been by creating the world sooner
   or later than it was actually created: And therefore, that there is no
   propriety or sense in the question, which has been considered. And
   perhaps it may be thought needless to introduce it here, and say so
   much, or even any thing by way of answer.

   It has been a question, when, or at what time of the year, the world
   was created, and time began? The general opinion has been that the
   world was made and time began at or about the autumnal equinox. It is
   reasonable to suppose that the fruits of the earth, necessary for the
   support and convenience of man, were all ready for his use, when he was
   created, and therefore that the trees, &c. were created with their
   fruit in maturity, which they have since constantly produced, at that
   time of the year; which in the climate in which Adam was created, is in
   the latter end of our September, or beginning of October. And there is
   this greater evidence that time began at that time of the year, viz.
   that all nations began their years at that time: and Abraham and his
   descendants did so, until they left the land of Egypt; when God ordered
   them to begin their religious year at the vernal equinox, which takes
   place in our March. Yet even then, and after that, they continued to
   begin their civil year at the autumnal equinox, as other nations did.
   This is evident from the beginning of the seventh month, reckoning from
   the beginning of their ecclesiastical year, being said to be in the end
   of the year: That is, when the year past had ended, and another year
   was begun. [152] "Thou shalt keep the feast of ingatheung, which is in
   the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the
   field."

   When God had created the world, and furnished the earth in a manner
   suited for the habitation of man, he created Adam, and then formed Eve
   out of one of his ribs, last of all in the end of the sixth day. The
   particular manner of making Eve, expressed the near and intimate union
   which was to take place between the sexes, and their mutual relation
   and dependence, together with the superiority of the man to the woman.
   These two were so formed, that the whole human race was contained and
   formed in them, and to be propagated from them; so that in creating
   these two parents of mankind, and commanding them to multiply and fill
   the earth, all mankind were created. And as, in creating them he made
   the whole human race, and they comprehended the whole; so there was a
   propriety, in treating them as if they were the whole, in his
   transactions with them, and what he said to them; in this, having
   respect to all their posterity, and comprehending them as much as if
   they had then actually existed. As in forming the trees and plants,
   with the seeds in them, according to their kind, by which they were to
   propagate the same kind to the end of the world, he created and really
   gave existence and form to all the trees and plants that grow out of
   the earth; they being all comprehended in the original stock; and
   existing after their several kinds, by the same command which formed
   the first of the kind, and under the same regulations and laws of
   nature: So in creating the original stock, the first parents of
   mankind, with power, and under a command to propagate their kind, God
   created all their posterity; and by forming them, formed the whole,
   after their kind. And what he did for, and with them, he did for all,
   and they, with all their race, were put under the same regulations and
   laws; and what he said to these parents of mankind, he said to them and
   their posterity,

   Man was made superior to all other creatures on the earth, being
   created with a rational soul, capable of understanding things of a
   moral nature, and acting voluntarily, from moral motives: by which he
   was placed in the moral world, being made capable of moral government;
   of being under a moral law, and of obedience, or disobedience to it;
   and of reward or punishment, according to his moral exercises and
   conduct. And he was made in the moral image of God, with a good
   discerning, taste or disposition, or rectitude of mind and will, or
   heart; by which he was perfectly conformed to the rule of his duty, or
   the moral law; which is the same with conformity to the moral character
   of God. This is to be made in the image of God, and after his likeness,
   in the highest and most proper sense, and to exist in the most
   excellent manner, and must be implied in the expression, "Let us make
   man in our image, and after our likeness." And in the assertion, "So
   God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him:"
   Though that which is less perfect and excellent may be implied in this,
   viz. his natural faculties and endowments of understanding and will,
   and his being made lord of this earth, having dominion over all
   inferior creatures on earth, and in the sea. The moral image of God
   must be implied and particularly intended, as it is asserted without
   any limitation or restriction to the natural image of God, and to be in
   his moral image, is unspeakably the greatest, most important and
   excellent: And without which, his natural abilities, and dominion over
   all other creatures, would be worse than nothing. But were there any
   doubt about the meaning, St. Paul puts it beyond dispute in giving the
   true and important sense of the image of God. [153] "And be renewed in
   the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after
   God (that is, after his image or likeness) is created in righteousness
   and true holiness." [154] "And have put on the new man, which is
   renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him." This is
   parallel with the passage cited from the epistle to the Ephesians, and
   therefore by knowledge here, is meant that true discerning which
   implies holiness, and which Christ says is eternal life, even to know
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to St. Paul,
   to be created after the image or likeness of God, is to be made truly
   holy, or to put on his moral image. To the same purpose he says, [155]
   "But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the
   Lord, are changed into the same image." The glory of the Lord, is his
   holiness: therefore to be changed into the same image, is to be made
   like God in holiness.

   Man was not only put at the head of this world, this earth, in which he
   was made, and all creatures and things in it; which were all made for
   him: but the whole creation was made with reference to him, and in a
   sense for him; so that he is the end of all, under God, and next to
   him. It has been observed, that the material or natural creation,
   however large we may suppose it to be; and even though it may exceed
   our imagination, was made with reference to the moral world, and for
   the sake of that; and that angels and men are most probably the only
   moral agents which were created; and that God's moral eternal kingdom
   will consist of these only. For the sake of these then the worlds were
   made; they are the end of all God's works, next to himself, who is the
   ultimate end of all; for God hath made all things for himself. He made
   the material, natural world for angels and men, to promote his designs
   concerning them; and he made them, who are the end of all his other
   works, for himself.

   And though man in his natural powers and capacities, and in his
   situation and circumstances, was first made lower than the angels, and
   in many respects inferior to them; yet, we learn from the scriptures,
   that he is more an ultimate end in the creation, than the angels; or
   that the angels were made for man, and not man for the angels. We may
   know the particular end for which God makes any creature or thing by
   the use to which he puts it, or the end which he makes it to answer.
   And the scripture teaches us that the angels are improved to answer
   God's ends respecting man, and that he uses them all in the service of
   man. [156] "Are they (the angels) not all ministering spirits, sent
   forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation?" It appears
   from divine revelation, that God designed to answer his ultimate end of
   the creation chiefly, and in the most eminent degree by man; and
   therefore all other creatures and things are subordinated to him, and
   made to answer the divine purposes with respect to him, even the
   angels, the highest and most noble order of beings that were created.
   The human race were the peculiar favourites of Heaven. The most
   important and glorious ends were designed to be answered by them. The
   redeemed from among men, the church, is the bride, the Lamb's wife, is
   to be raised in dignity and glory, far above the angels: to sit with
   Christ in heaven, and reign with him in a peculiar union to him, as the
   members of which he is the head: while the angels are represented as
   standing round about the redeemed, waiting upon them and ministering
   unto them. The Son of God took not on him the nature of angels, but of
   man, and has hereby laid a foundation to raise the redeemed, who were
   originally made below the angels, and by sin had sunk infinitely low in
   unworthiness, guilt and wretchedness, far above the angels in honour,
   glory and happiness: And hereby is made the brightest and most glorious
   eternal display of infinite power, wisdom, goodness, justice, mercy,
   grace, truth and faithfulness; in which God is glorified to the highest
   degree, that is conceivable or even possible. Into these things
   therefore the angels desire to look. They are all attention to man, and
   the wonderful glorious scene that is opened respecting him; and by the
   church of Christ, and the wonders of redemption, are made known unto
   them the manifold wisdom of God. Therefore the angels, with all other
   things visible and invisible, were made for Christ, considered in the
   capacity and character of the Redeemer and Saviour of the church. [157]
   "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in
   the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions,
   principalities or powers: All things were created by him, and for him."
   Therefore when he came into the world to redeem his church by his
   obedience and death, all the angels of God received command to worship
   him; that is, to submit and devote themselves to him, to wait upon and
   serve him in the work and business which lie came into the world to
   perform, in favour of mankind. Accordingly, a multitude of those
   heavenly hosts attended upon him, when he first appeared in the world,
   and worshipped him; and were with gladness and joy his messengers to
   carry the good tidings of his incarnation to men. And they waited upon
   him, and ministered to him, while he was tempted of the devil, and
   laboured and suffered in this world; and when he rose from the grave,
   they were present to serve him, and to tell the good news to his
   friends. And when he ascended into heaven, all the angels accompanied
   him with veneration and joy; rejoicing in his exaltation and glory,
   when he sat down on the right hand of God; and they were all made
   subject unto him, voluntarily giving themselves to him, to be the
   willing instruments in promoting his cause and work in the salvation of
   sinners; rejoicing in the conversion of the elect, and cheerfully
   serving and ministering to the heirs of salvation. Therefore because
   the angels were made for man, and are the devoted servants of Christ in
   his work of redemption, and of the redeemed, constantly waiting upon
   them, and ministering to them, Christ speaking of the redeemed, calls
   the angels, their angels.

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. The view we have now taken of the creation of the world, though a
   very partial imperfect one, is sufficient to impress our minds with a
   belief and assurance of the being of God, and of his power, greatness,
   wisdom and goodness; the marks and evidences of which are every where
   to be seen, in the things which are made. The existence of the world,
   and of all things round us which we behold, and our own existence, and
   the manner of it, are a demonstration, constantly held before our eyes,
   of the existence of an invisible Being, who has power and wisdom enough
   to contrive and produce all these things in their order and harmony;
   and so as to supply the wants, and promote the happiness of the
   sensible part of the creation: And that this Being exists independent,
   necessarily, and therefore without beginning, absolutely and infinitely
   perfect, happy and glorious. And the more we attend to the creation,
   and examine the great works, the sun, moon and stars, or this globe on
   which we live, and the various ranks of creatures which come under our
   notice, the more clear and striking will be the evidence of design, and
   of the power, wisdom and goodness of the Creator. And we ought hereby
   to be led sensibly to say with the Psalmist, "O Lord, how manifold are
   thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy
   riches." And may well join with the four and twenty Elders, "saying,
   thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for
   thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were
   created."

   II. From what has been observed concerning the creation of man, his
   endowments and circumstances, we are led particularly to reflect upon
   the goodness of God to him, in making a world for him, every way
   furnished for his convenience and happiness; in forming him for the
   moral world, by giving him understanding and moral liberty, in acting
   voluntarily in the view of moral motives; thus making him a moral
   agent, capable of virtue or vice, of reward or punishment; and
   therefore immortal, giving him an existence never to end. He made him
   lord of the world in which he was placed, giving him dominion over all
   the creatures in the earth and sea. He formed him in his own image,
   after his likeness, a perfectly holy creature, which is the highest
   excellence in the universe, by which he was united to his Creator in
   perfect love and friendship, enjoying a sweet and happy intercourse and
   intimacy with him.

   In this happy state all mankind were created and placed; for, as has
   been observed, all the posterity of Adam were included in him, and what
   was done for him was done for all. And we ought to consider ourselves
   as originally placed in the happy state in which Adam was created. And
   if Adam was under obligation to exercise peculiar gratitude to his
   Maker for his wonderful goodness to him, we are to consider ourselves
   under the same obligation to gratitude for creating goodness, and view
   all the kindness conferred on our first parents in their creation, as
   conferred on all their posterity. And if the apostasy of Adam, by which
   he fell from this happy state, and plunged into unspeakable
   wretchedness, did not dissolve his obligation to gratitude for the
   happy state in which he was at first placed, and the goodness of God to
   him herein, as it certainly did not; then, notwithstanding his and our
   sin has rendered us miserable, we are not for this reason under the
   less obligation to gratitude for the goodness of God to us in our
   creation, and the happy state in which he placed mankind, in which Adam
   and all his race would have continued forever, had they not fallen from
   it, by rebellion against their Creator.

   III. We are hence led to see, and reflect upon, the magnitude and
   aggravation of the crime of the first rebellion of man against God.
   Man's obligations were every way infinitely great to love and obey his
   Creator. The greatness, excellence and infinite worthiness of God,
   brought an infinite obligation on man to love and obey him. His
   deriving his being wholly from God, and the consequent absolute
   propriety and right God had to him, increased his obligation to devote
   all he was and all he had to him, to his honour and service. And his
   particular and great goodness to man unspeakably increased his
   obligations to obedience, love and gratitude. And as it was his supreme
   happiness to love, serve and enjoy God, and in this way only he could
   secure to himself and his posterity perfect and eternal felicity, and
   by refusing to do this, must bring upon himself the infinite
   displeasure of his Maker, and sink into complete and eternal wo, with
   all his posterity; this brought an immense addition of obligation on
   him, to love and obedience. [158]

   What finite mind can measure or comprehend die greatness, the
   aggravations of the crime, in man's violating all these obligations, by
   rising in rebellion against his Creator and owner, and ungratefully
   abusing his infinite goodness to him! Surely the crime of this is
   unmeasurable by man or angels. We must pronounce it boundless, or
   infinite; which can therefore be comprehended by God alone, who has
   proclaimed the infinitude of it, by threatening it with infinite evil,
   even endless misery.

   [158] It has been thought by some, that to suppose every sin which men
   commit against God, is an infinite evil, or a crime infinitely great,
   is to make every sin of equal magnitude, and that, according to this,
   one crime cannot be greater and more aggravated than another. And this
   objection may arise in the minds of some readers, when they attend to
   this representation of the many aggravations of sin, by which the crime
   of it is increased, while it is at the same time asserted, that every
   sin is infinitely criminal, as it is committed against God. All this
   may be easily obviated, only by observing, that every sin, and the
   deserved punishment of it, may be infinite in one respect; and yet some
   sins, and the just punishment of them, be unspeakably greater than
   others, there being in other respects a great difference. Two cords or
   cylinders may be considered as extended in length without end, or to be
   infinitely long, or of equal extension in length; and yet differ
   greatly in their diameters; and, in this respect, have vastly different
   degrees of magnitude. Two men may be in pain, and yet one of them may
   suffer an unspeakably greater degree of pain, than the other; and if
   the pain of each were continued without end, he who suffers the least
   would be doomed to infinite evil; yet the other must suffer evil,
   unspeakably greater, every minute.

CHAP. VI.

  CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE IN GENERAL.

   DIVINE Providence consists in preserving, directing and governing all
   creatures and things which are made; or in taking the most wise and
   effectual care of them, so as to make them answer the end for which
   they are created.

   God preserves or upholds all things by his powerful word; by the
   constant exertion of the same power, by which they were at first
   created, or caused to exist. Every created thing is constantly and
   entirely dependent on the Creator, for continuance in existence. Should
   that power which first caused it to exist be withdrawn, or cease to be
   exerted one moment, it would have no existence; it would cease to
   exist, and sink into its original nothing. It is impossible that a
   creature should be made, so as to exist one moment, in any respect or
   degree independent of the Creator; it must be as really and as much
   dependent on him for continuance in existence, as for its first
   existence. Therefore preservation is a constant exertion of the same
   power which first produced the existence of the creature, in causing or
   giving continual existence; and is really continued creation.

   Every part of creation, and each creature and thing in it, from the
   greatest down to the least, is not only constantly upheld by the
   exertion of the same power which first gave existence; but is in all
   respects continually under the direction and governing power and care
   of the Creator, in every change, as to the place or manner of
   existence, and every motion, by which God orders, disposes and uses
   every thing in his creation, to accomplish his own infinitely wise and
   important designs. As God created all things for himself, in order to
   accomplish his own designs, being formed according to his pleasure; so
   he uses every thing, so as in the wisest and best manner to answer the
   end for which it was designed. If any the least thing were not so
   directed and used, as to answer the end designed, it would be created
   in vain; which is inconsistent with the wisdom and goodness of the
   Creator. God governs the world, and all things in it, by stated and
   fixed laws or rules, which are called the laws, or the course of
   nature, by which all motions and events take place, in a certain order,
   and constant series and connection of cause and effect. But this law,
   or course of nature, is nothing but divine power and wisdom constantly
   exerted, to cause things to take place in such a stated way and manner;
   or the divine will, establishing such an order in events; and does not
   suppose any power in creatures, or any created thing, to cause such
   motions and events, aside from the immediate exertion of divine power,
   which is the proper efficient cause of every event: so that all power
   is in God, and all creatures which act, or move, exist and move, or are
   moved in and by him.

   This fixed law and course of nature, which, as has been observed, is
   nothing but the divine will, wisely determined to operate in a certain,
   steady, fixed manner, by way of cause and effect, the same cause
   generally producing the same effect, is necessary in order to man's
   gaining any proper knowledge of things around him, and obtaining any
   prudence and wisdom, with regard to the objects with which he is
   concerned, and by which he is to regulate his conduct, form his plans
   and prospects; and to excite his hopes, fears and exertions. Were there
   no settled order and fixed connection in things and events, there would
   be no foundation for all this; but man would be involved in total
   darkness and uncertainty, without any knowledge and wisdom to conduct
   any of his affairs, or any motive to action, in matters relating to his
   body. And in this established order and connection in the visible
   creation, not only the power, but the wisdom, and steady counsel, the
   goodness, truth and faithfulness of him who worketh all things by the
   counsel of his own will, a e constantly manifested to man; which is
   asserted in the sacred writings.

   When this stated course of events, or these laws of nature, are
   interrupted and visibly counteracted, and events take place in a
   contrary manner; these events are called miracles, though there is no
   more power necessary, or really exerted and manifested in these, than
   there is in producing events according to the ordinary course of
   things. No more power is necessary or manifested in causing the sun to
   stand still, or move from West to East, than there is in causing it to
   keep a steady, uninterrupted course from East to West. The former would
   be a miracle, the latter is not. The Governor of the world may and
   does, for wise reasons, and to answer important ends, thus visibly
   counteract the general course of things and events; and that on such
   occasions, and in those instances and ways, as not to frustrate the
   general and important ends to be answered by the steady course of
   things, which he has established. And in how many instances among the
   inconceivable number and variety of events which take place, they are
   brought about and caused to exist just at such a time, and in such a
   manner, not according to any stated law, or course of things, no man
   can tell; as the agent, by whose constant energy all things are
   conducted, is invincible to us; and may act immediately, or by the
   instrumentality of invisible agents; and yet this may be done, so as
   not visibly to counteract the stated laws or course of nature, or be
   the least obstruction to the exercise of human wisdom and prudence, in
   every thing in which men are concerned. No one can doubt of this, who
   will carefully attend to the matter, and observe the representation of
   it in the holy scriptures. All such instances, be they ever so many,
   may be called miracles, though invisible to man, being out of the reach
   of our perception, as they are of the same nature and kind with those
   instances above mentioned, in which, what is called the course of
   nature, is visibly, or to our senses, counteracted, and events take
   place contrary to it, which we call miracles.

   This care and providence of God, in directing and governing all
   creatures and things, is universal, and constant, respecting all things
   at all times; and is extended to the least, as well as the greatest and
   more important existence; and is concerned in every event, however
   minute, and in our view inconsiderable. Not a sparrow, or the least
   bird or insect, falls to the ground, or dies, without the direction and
   agency of God. The hairs of our head are all carefully numbered; and so
   many and not one more are ordered to exist, and not one is removed or
   broken, without the order and operation of the divine hand. And this is
   equally true of every hair on men and beasts, and of each leaf in the
   forest, or spire of grass on the earth that ever have existed, or will
   exist, to the end of the world.

   In the exercise of this divine providence, some events take place by
   the more immediate energy and agency of God; and others by the
   instrumentality and agency of creatures, and by various mediums, and
   what are called second causes. But in all the events of the latter
   kind, the divine hand, power and energy, is as really and as much
   concerned and exerted, and is really as evident, and as much to be
   acknowledged, as if no instrument, agent, or second cause were used, or
   had any concern in the matter. Because the creature or the instrument
   has no power to act or effect any thing, independent of God, or which
   is not given to him by God. And is in the hand of God, as the axe or
   saw is in the hand of the workman. This is the light in which divine
   revelation every where represents the providence of God, as every one
   who carefully attends to it, must be sensible. And what has been
   observed shows that this is perfectly consonant to reason; and that a
   different and contrary idea of divine providence is insupportable and
   inconsistent. [159]

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. From this scriptural view of divine providence, it appears, that
   they are in a great and dangerous error, who believe and assert, that
   the creation, and all creatures, when once made, have power to subsist
   of themselves, and stand alone by their own power, given to them in
   their creation; and to continue in motion and action, independent of
   any immediate exertion of divine energy, to support and direct them:
   that creation and creatures, once made and put in order, go on in a
   regular course of their own accord; and that God does never interpose,
   or take any farther care of the works of his hand. Every one who has
   attended to the Bible must be sensible that such a notion is very
   inconsistent with that: And it is most unreasonable, as it supposes
   that which is impossible, viz. That the creature may subsist of itself,
   when once made, in a measure independent of the Creator. This is
   contrary to all true philosophy: and at the same time dishonourable to
   God, as if he did not take a particular and wise care of the things he
   has made, and exercise and manifest his power, wisdom and goodness, in
   preserving and governing the world, and all things in it. And it tends
   to suppress and even eradicate all true piety, by leading to conceive
   of the Creator, as at a distance, and in a great measure out of sight;
   and as it obliterates a sense of our immediate dependence on God, and
   encourages self-dependence. In a word, it makes too much of creatures,
   and raises them infinitely too high, by which the Creator and Governor
   of the world is concealed and hid; whereas in a right view of divine
   providence, every creature and all events exhibit Deity to view, as
   constantly present in every thing, in the exercise of omniscience,
   power, wisdom, rectitude and goodness; and unite to impress that sense
   of the divine Being on the mind, and lead to that acknowledgment of
   him, in which all true piety most essentially consists.

   II. We are, therefore, in the next place, led to observe, that the true
   philosophical and scriptural account of divine providence, opens the
   most ample field for the exercise of piety and religion; as it leads us
   to see God in all things, and in every event; to fear him, trust in
   him, and acknowledge him in all our ways, feeling our immediate,
   constant, absolute dependence upon him. This leads us to hear him
   speaking important truths, in an intelligible language, by all
   creatures and things with which we are surrounded, and in all events;
   which calls for answerable exercises of prayer, acknowledgments,
   thanksgiving and praise, and a constant glorifying him, in whose hand
   is our breath and all our ways. Of such exercises and expressions of
   piety we have many examples in the holy scriptures; which, at the same
   time, appear perfectly rational.

   III. Hence we learn the reasonableness and duty of a cheerful
   submission to God, and acquiescence in the events which take place
   under his direction and providence. Not to submit is to oppose God and
   his will, and to resist infinite wisdom and goodness. Every event that
   takes place is under the immediate direction of unerring wisdom and
   goodness, and ordered for the greatest good, to promote the most
   important and best ends; and is therefore so far from being the
   reasonable ground of any reluctance and regret in us, that we ought not
   only barely to submit, but to acquiesce with pleasure, and rejoice that
   God reigns, and hath done, and continues to do, whatsoever he pleaseth;
   and worketh all things, according to the counsel of his own will.

   IV. How safe and happy are they who put their trust in God! He who
   directs and governs all things, and orders every event; who is
   infinitely above all control, on whom all things entirely depend; who
   does whatsoever he pleases in heaven and among the children of men on
   earth: He is engaged by repeated promises to them, that no evil shall
   come near them to hurt them: but that every thing shall work together
   for their good. If God be thus for them, who or what can be against
   them? The Lord reigneth, let them who trust in him always rejoice. Weil
   may they say, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
   trouble. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and
   though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea» Though the
   waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with
   the swelling thereof." "Oh Lord of hosts, Blessed is the man that
   trusteth in thee!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] That such a divine providence as is here described and asserted,
   which is rational, and every where supposed and held up to view in the
   Bible, is perfectly consistent with the moral agency and liberty of
   man, appears from a foregoing chapter on the decrees of God.

CHAP. VII.

  ON THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD, AS IT RESPECTS MORAL AGENTS, ANGELS AND MEN.
     __________________________________________________________________

Section I.

   Concerning Divine Providence, as it respects the Angels.

   AS moral agents are the highest and most noble and important part of
   the creation, they are the end of all the rest; and all the inferior
   creatures and things were made, and are preserved and governed, for the
   sake of these, who are the subjects of moral government; which is by
   far the most excellent and important. Of these, we know of none but
   angels and men: And it has been observed, that we have no evidence that
   there are any other creatures in the created universe, capable of moral
   government. We know nothing of the existence, number, capacity or
   employment of angels, but what we learn from divine revelation. We are
   there informed, that in their original formation, they were made a
   higher rank of beings than man, and with greater natural capacities;
   that their number is very great; that they were made perfectly holy,
   and under law to God, otherwise there would have been no foundation for
   the fall and ruin of any of them, by disobedience and sin, which we are
   told has been in fact the case. And. were they not at first holy, there
   could have been no apostasy by rebellion, or by leaving their first
   state.

   But that they were under moral government, we maybe certain, from the
   reason and nature of the case. They being made rational creatures and
   moral agents, and so capable of moral government, must be under such a
   government, in order to be treated properly, or according to their
   nature and capacity. A moral law is essential to moral government;
   requiring of rational creatures those exercises, and that conduct, of
   which they are capable, and which are reasonable and proper. We are not
   expressly told what this law was, as it relates to angels, and what was
   particularly required of them. But we can be at no great loss about the
   general requirement of it. They must be under obligation, from the
   first of their existence, to love God with all their hearts, and their
   fellow creatures as themselves. This therefore was required of them.
   The law they were under must require this, as it was the rule of their
   duty; and therefore must require the whole of their duty. This law did
   not, strictly speaking, make it their duty to exercise and express this
   love; but required and commanded it, because it was their duty. And it
   could require no more, this being the whole of their duty; unless it
   were to point out in particular instances in what way they should
   exercise and express this love to God, and to other creatures, by
   express positive injunctions and prohibitions. How many, or whether any
   of these; or if there were any, in the law given to angels, we are not
   particularly and expressly informed.

   In order to this being a complete law, or having the nature of a law,
   so as to exercise and maintain moral government, there must be a
   penalty expressed or implied, threatening evil to disobedience to the
   precept: For if the creature be exposed to no evil, by disregarding the
   command, more than by obeying, he cannot be said to be under any moral
   government; nor does God express or exercise any authority, as moral
   Governor, if he neither inflicts nor threatens evil to the
   transgressor. And if it be a perfect law, and a perfect government, as
   God's law and government certainly are, the evil or punishment
   threatened must be exactly proportioned to the crime, or the desert of
   the transgressor. And as the transgression of the law of God must be a
   crime proportioned in its magnitude, to the creature's obligation to
   obedience; and this obligation is great in proportion to the
   excellence, dignity and authority of God, which are all infinite, it
   follows, as certain and clear as any mathematical demonstration, that
   such a crime is infinitely great; and therefore deserves a punishment
   which is infinitely great and dreadful, that is, an endless punishment.

   We therefore have sufficient light and evidence to determine, that the
   angels were under a law, requiring them to love God with all their
   hearts, and their fellow creatures as themselves; and to yield perfect
   obedience to every positive command which God had given, or should give
   to them; and threatening them with infinite evil, even endless
   destruction and misery, for the least single instance of disobedience:
   For no less than this was their duty, and therefore God must require it
   of them; and the least transgression, or neglect of coming up to their
   duty, could deserve no less than complete and endless evil; and
   therefore God must threaten it; or this must be the penalty of his
   perfect law.

   That the angels were under such a law, with such a penalty, is yet
   farther evident, if possible, from known fact, which has taken place.
   Some of the angels have sinned by transgressing this law; and for one,
   the first, transgression, they have fallen into endless destruction.
   For, St. Peter says, "God spared not the angels that sinned; but cast
   them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be
   reserved unto judgment." And cur Saviour tells us what will be their
   doom at the day of judgment; and that they will then be cast into
   everlasting fire, which is prepared for them. We therefore know by
   this, had we no light from any other quarter, that the angels were
   under a law, requiring perfect obedience, and threatening every act of
   disobedience with endless destruction. The experiment has been actually
   made, and every one that sinned, that was guilty of the least deviation
   from perfect obedience to the law (for every such deviation is sin) has
   perished; has fallen into a state of endless misery. Therefore every
   transgression of the divine law; every sin deserves endless punishment;
   and this is the only proper penalty of such a law.

   The threatening of infinite evil to disobedience seems to imply a
   promise of good or happiness to obedience; or, at least, a continuance
   of existence in a state of happiness, so long as the creature continues
   obedient: For though annihilation be not a positive evil; yet it must
   appear to a happy creature, enjoying the pleasure of obedience, and of
   the favour of God, and having an ardent desire to serve and glorify
   him, to be an unspeakably great evil, though it be a negative one, to
   have his existence taken away; and be forever deprived of all his
   happiness, by annihilation. This would be to him a real and great
   punishment. And we have good reason to believe, that to annihilate such
   a creature, is not agreeable to infinite wisdom, rectitude and
   goodness; and therefore, that God never will do it; but we may be
   certain that every moral agent shall continue in existence and
   happiness, and enjoy the favour of God, so long as he continues in
   obedience; and that this is implied in the threatening: For a
   threatening to inflict evil on the disobedient, necessarily implies
   that he will not inflict any on the obedient, even the negative evil of
   ceasing to exist. And indeed the innocent and obedient must be
   considered as having a right to impunity. Hence, by the way, it
   appears, that moral agents must and will exist without end; as this is
   necessary, in order to the proper exercise of moral government, and
   their being the proper subjects of such government. For the moral law,
   which is essential to moral government, must threaten infinite evil to
   all who disobey it. Therefore the disobedient must exist forever, in
   order to suffer the evil threatened, and which they deserve. And those
   who never disobey can never cease to exist, consistent with the wisdom,
   rectitude and goodness of the Lawgiver and Governor.

   It may be farther observed, that there is reason to conclude, that the
   best and most perfect moral government, is not consistent with moral
   agents being continued in a state of trial, without end, so as to be
   continually exposed to fall by sin, and always remain in a total
   uncertainty, whether they shall persevere in obedience, or fall into
   endless perdition, by transgression. That there should be a time for
   such trial, is certainly proper, and necessary to answer the best ends
   in moral government. How long this time shall be, and with what
   particular circumstances it is best it should be attended, the
   infinitely wise and sovereign Governor only, is able, and has a right
   to determine. It is also certain that God is not so obliged in justice
   to the obedient creature, to confirm him in holiness and happiness,
   after the longest term of obedience, that he would do any injury or
   wrong to him, if he should not grant this favour. For the creature can
   never merit or deserve such a reward by any obedience whatsoever; so
   that eternal life should be a debt due to him, for what he has done.
   The creature by giving all he has, that is, by perfect and constant
   obedience to the law of God, gives no more than he constantly owes to
   God, or only just pays a debt which is due; and therefore continually
   demanded of him. Therefore he can have no demand on his Maker, of any
   positive reward, or of any thing which is due to him.

   But notwithstanding all this, considering how undesirable it must be to
   the obedient creature, to be always in suspense, knowing himself in
   danger every moment, of falling into sin, and eternal ruin; and that he
   depends wholly upon God for preservation from this evil; and that he is
   under no obligation to grant it: And, on the contrary, considering how
   very desirable and pleasing it must be to such a creature, to arrive to
   a state of certainty that he shall never fall into sin and misery;
   being confirmed by God, in a state of perfect holiness and happiness
   forever: And considering what a strong motive and great encouragement
   to obedience, it would afford to the creature, for God to promise him,
   that upon his continuance in obedience for a set time, which he will
   fix, he shall be confirmed in his favour, in holiness and happiness
   forever, without any possibility of falling into sin and ruin: And
   since such a promise, on such a condition, would be a striking
   manifestation of God's love of virtue and holiness, in that he grants
   so great a reward of the obedience of his creatures; and an expression
   of his bountiful munificence and infinite goodness: Considering all
   this, and more that might be mentioned, is there not reason to conclude
   that such a promise is essential to the best and most perfect moral
   government; and that this promise is always implied or expressed, in
   God's law, under which all moral agents are originally placed, and
   which threatens infinite evil to the transgressor? Such a law or
   constitution, with such requirements, promises and threatenings, may be
   called a covenant, in which what is required of the creature is stated
   and fixed; and the rule and manner of God's conduct towards him, and
   treatment of him, is also revealed and established.

   That the angels were under such a constitution, law or covenant, which
   not only threatened endless punishment to the disobedient, but promised
   a confirmation in holiness and happiness upon their continuing
   obedient, through a certain time of trial, and that this time of trial
   is long since over, is evident from scripture, in that they were in the
   apostles' days called elect angels, which denotes their being fixed in
   holiness and the favour of God; or that they had a sure title to
   eternal life. And the endless torment of the wicked is represented as
   being in the presence or sight of the holy angels, which supposes, at
   least, that they will be holy and happy without end.

   How long the time of trial was before they were confirmed, who
   continued obedient; and what was the special test and trial of their
   obedience, if there were any; and what was the particular temptation
   and sin of those who fell into rebellion and ruin, we are not expressly
   informed in divine revelation. Yet perhaps it will appear that we are
   not left wholly in the dark, respecting these particulars, if we attend
   to the following things, some of which seem to be suggested from the
   holy scriptures, and are here offered as being probable.

   It has been observed, that it appears from scripture, that man is more
   an ultimate end, than the angels; that angels were made to answer ends
   respecting man, and in this sense were made for man; and that this
   appears from the use which God makes of the angels, in giving and
   subjecting them all to Christ, as the Redeemer of man, to be improved
   by him as instruments of promoting his designs in the redemption of
   sinners; and to minister to, and serve the redeemed from among mankind;
   and that they were therefore created for Christ, considered as God,
   Man, Mediator, and Redeemer of sinners, and are his angels, to be used
   by him in carrying on his great designs in the redemption of his
   church.

   May we not infer from this, that when the angels and man were made, the
   angels were, in some way, made to know, that God had peculiar and grand
   designs to answer by man; that, though mankind were made so much
   inferior to them; yet they were to be the peculiar favourites of
   Heaven; and that one of that race in the human nature, even a Man,
   should be the head of a most glorious kingdom; and be the Lord of
   angels, to whom they must yield a most ready obedience; being employed
   by him in ministering to, and serving his friends and subjects of the
   human race: That this was one end for which they were made; and that
   their cheerfully complying with the revealed will of God, in this
   matter, and submitting to this person as their Lord, and serving him,
   and his friends of the human race, should be the particular test of
   their obedience and faithfulness; and if they did cordially acquiesce
   in this design, and persevere in obedience to this revelation and
   command, through the time of their trial, they should be confirmed in
   holiness and happiness forever. As this now appears to have been God's
   design, respecting the angels, and that he made them for this end; and
   as this was doubtless the greatest trial, whether they would be
   obedient in all things, is it not reasonable to suppose, that so much
   of this divine scheme was revealed to the angels, as was necessary to
   give them opportunity, voluntarily to consent, and acquiesce in it, and
   cheerfully devote themselves to this service?

   This revelation and injunction of the Most High, made known in a degree
   and manner agreeable to infinite wisdom, was most probably the occasion
   of the rebellion of those angels who sinned; they disapproved, and
   refused to comply with it. Lucifer, who was at the head of all the
   angels, the highest and most noble creature that God had made, was
   displeased with such a plan: Pride entered his heart, and he was not
   willing, he refused to obey this command, and stoop so low as to become
   a servant to the inferior, diminutive creature man, and be subjected to
   serve and adore one in the human nature, as his lord and king. This
   immediately sunk him down from his high station; and by his example and
   influence, myriads of angels went off, and joined with him in
   rebellion. Thus they by sin left their first station, and were banished
   from heaven; and by the arm of the Almighty were cast down to hell.

   This, perhaps, will in the most natural way account for the head of
   these fallen angels, immediately entering upon a plan to seduce and
   ruin man, by tempting him to sin, as he had done; supposing that he
   should hereby effectually defeat God's revealed designs, respecting
   him, against which he had rebelled. And this may also in the best
   manner account for his opposing with all his cunning and might, and by
   all his servants and angels, the redemption and salvation of men; and
   his hating and opposing the Redeemer, and attempting to defeat him in
   his designs, in every possible way, and to destroy every one of the
   human race; being a peculiar enemy to the church, and all the friends
   of Christ. To all this he is naturally led by his first sin, and is
   only persevering in opposing that, against which he rose, in his first
   rebellion.

   This apostasy, whatever was the occasion of it, was a very important
   event indeed, the consequences of which will continue to eternity. It,
   with many of its consequences, are, in themselves considered,
   infinitely dreadful. But the designs of the Most High are not in the
   least frustrated by all this; but his council and plan are hereby
   established; and this was necessary to bring to effect, and complete
   his infinitely wise purposes.

   It has been observed, that there is evidence from scripture, that the
   angels who have not sinned are now, and have been, long since, in a
   confirmed state; And from what has been now supposed, concerning the
   special trial of their obedience, it has been thought that they
   continued in a state of trial, until the ascension of our Lord Jesus
   Christ; and that they were then confirmed in holiness, and his favour,
   They were obedient to the divine orders, and all attention to man,
   particularly to the church and people of God, willingly ministering to
   them, and serving them and their Lord, from the fall of man to the
   incarnation of the Son of God. But their greatest trial did not take
   place, until he who was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery
   to be equal with God, took upon him the form of a servant, and was made
   in the likeness of men, being born of a poor virgin, and laid an infant
   in a manger; when he appeared as an outcast in the wilderness,
   assaulted and tempted by the devil; when he lived a poor despised man;
   and was finally apprehended, being betrayed by one of his disciples
   into the hands of men, and condemned as a malefactor, and crucified and
   buried in a tomb. In this time, while the Son of God was in this state
   of humiliation, the angels continued to own him as their Lord, they
   attended upon him constantly, and were his willing, faithful servants.
   They attended him when in a manger, and with pleasure carried the
   joyful news of his birth to the shepherds, and the whole multitude of
   them sang praises on the occasion. They were with him when in the
   wilderness, assaulted by Satan, and ministered to him. They assisted
   and strengthened him when he was in an agony in the garden. And when on
   the cross, and in the grave, they were his constant attendants; and
   proclaimed his resurrection from the dead, to his disciples. And when
   he ascended from earth to heaven, and sat down on the throne of the
   universe, ail these mighty angels came down and attended upon him, and
   ascended with him with joy, and added to the triumph and splendor of
   that event: And when they saw him seated in glory, all heaven was
   filled with a joy which never was known there before; and all these
   angels renewedly devoted themselves to the service of Christ and his
   church; and were made voluntarily subject unto him. Then, it is
   supposed probable, Christ their Lord said unto them, "Well done, good
   and faithful servants, you have been faithful to me through the time of
   my, and your greatest trial, and have persevered in the most willing
   and cheerful obedience: I therefore now put an end to your state of
   trial, and publicly confirm you in holiness and happiness, and confer
   on you the reward of eternal life." And as their election of God to
   eternal life was now made known, they are after this, but not before,
   called "elect angels."

Section II.

   Concerning the Providence of God, as it respects Man in a state of
   Innocency.

   Man being made upright, or perfectly holy, this necessarily supposes a
   rule of right, or that there was a right and wrong in moral character
   and conduct: and that God did, and could not but require or command
   that which is morally right, and forbid the contrary; or, in other
   words, that man was under moral government, which supposes a law
   requiring perfect obedience of him, or his whole duty, and forbidding
   all disobedience, on pain of suffering the just desert of it. What has
   been observed in the foregoing section of angels, respecting the nature
   of the moral government, and the law under which they were; [160] is
   equally applicable to man: and proves that he was certainly and
   necessarily under such a law, which required him to love God with all
   his heart, and his neighbour as himself, and to express this in all
   proper ways; and to obey every precept which God should give him; with
   a penalty annexed, threatening every instance of disobedience with a
   punishment exactly answerable to the crime, which must be endless
   suffering. So much is certainly essential to moral government, and
   necessary, in order to man's being treated as a moral agent, by his
   Creator.

   We have indeed no particular account of this law, or history of man's
   being put under this moral government, in the inspired narrative which
   Moses has given of the primitive state of innocency. And there is this
   very good reason to be given for it, viz. because it was entirely
   needless. The most express narrative of this matter would not have made
   it more plain and certain than it now is: There is now as great and as
   clear evidence of it, as there is, that man was created with a capacity
   for moral agency, and is a proper subject of moral government, as has
   been proved. But if this were not so evident from the nature of the
   case, it might be demonstrated from what has been since revealed. St.
   Paul, speaking of the law under which all mankind are, asserts the
   tenor of it in these words, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."
   [161] This law must have existed before man sinned, and while he had
   opportunity, and was in a capacity to continue to do every thing
   required by it; for if man, when in these circumstances, was not under
   this law, with this sanction, and bound by it, there could be no reason
   or propriety in making this requirement on such a penalty, when man had
   already violated it, and rendered it impossible to come up to, or do
   what is required: Which the Apostle says is the case with all mankind,
   since the original apostasy; for they are all under the curse of this
   law. It necessarily follows, therefore, that man was originally made
   under this law, when in a state of innocency, which denounced a curse
   upon him, if he failed of perfect obedience. This curse implies in it
   all the evil that man is capable of suffering, even endless
   destruction; and will take place in its fulness, and without any
   abatement on those to whom Christ, at the day of judgment, will say,
   "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." We must look
   forward to this time, to see it completely executed. This then, we may
   be sure, is the penalty of the law, under which man was placed, when he
   became a subject of moral government; which is also true of angels, as
   has been proved in the preceding section. So far therefore, we go on
   sure ground: No particular express revelation could make it more
   evident and certain: Therefore we may see good reason why we have no
   such revelation.

   It has been observed, that the sum of duty required in the moral law,
   is love: To love God with all the heart, and our neighbour as
   ourselves. This we are sure of from the express declaration of Christ.
   [162] He has reduced the whole moral law to this, and said that, "On
   these two commandments, hang all the law and the prophets." This
   includes and enjoins obedience to all special or positive directions
   and commands, which God may be pleased to give at any time; for love to
   God implies obedience to all his particular commands, as disregard to
   any of his injunctions, is contrary to love to him. How many, and what
   particular and positive commands God gave to man, when he was at first
   created, and in a state of innocency, we are not told: But some of them
   are expressed, or may be collected from what is related. A Sabbath was
   instituted, God blessed and sanctified the seventh day from the
   beginning of the creation, which Christ says, "was made for man;" and
   therefore he must have been commanded to keep it holy, or dedicate it
   to sacred uses in the worship of God, &c. laying aside the business and
   employment which might be attended on other days. God instituted
   marriage, and consequently all the duties peculiar to such a relation;
   and commanded man to multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue and
   cultivate it. He gave him authority and dominion over all inferior
   creatures; which is a command to exercise government and dominion over
   them, and use them for his convenience and profit: But it appears from
   another direction, that he was forbid to kill and eat them for
   sustenance; and probably was not allowed to put an end to the life of
   any animal, on any occasion. The direction or command mentioned, is in
   the following words, "And God said, behold, I have given you every herb
   bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
   in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed: To you it shall be
   for meat." Thus they were commanded to live on vegetables, and had no
   license to eat animal food; but a prohibition of this is implied. He
   was ordered into the garden of Eden, and commanded to dress, and to
   keep it. He was allowed to eat of every tree of the garden except one;
   and he was commanded not to eat of that, upon the severest penalty.
   "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying. Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and
   evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest
   thereof, thou shalt surely die."

   We cannot justly infer, from this prohibition or command only being
   mentioned, that man was not prohibited the violation of the moral law,
   in every instance, upon the same penalty; or that there were no other
   positive commands given to him, guarded with an equally severe
   threatening, in case of disobedience; or that this prohibition was the
   only test of his obedience; or that if he had violated any other
   command, it would not have been attended with equally fatal
   consequences. The contrary has been proved above; by which it is very
   evident, it is presumed, to all who will properly consider the matter,
   that they who have supposed any of those things, have no reasonable
   foundation for what they have believed and asserted. This positive
   prohibition, with the threatened penalty, is thus particularly
   mentioned, for two very good reasons: First, because it was a positive
   prohibition or command, and therefore it could not have been known that
   man was forbidden to eat of that particular tree, unless it had been
   thus particularly narrated. Secondly, because man actually fell from
   his innocence and happiness, and incurred the threatened penalty, by
   disregarding this prohibition, and eating of the fruit of this
   forbidden tree. Had he sinned by transgressing any other positive
   command, which we know nothing of now; that, in this case, would have
   been as particularly mentioned, with the same penalty, as this now is,
   and we should have heard nothing of this, in a history so concise, as
   that which Moses was inspired to give, in which not a word is
   mentioned, which was not necessary, in order to understand the
   important story; leaving many things implied in the history, to be
   investigated or inferred from what is written, or to be farther opened
   and explained in some future revelation.

   It has been a great question, What this threatening imports? What is
   meant by the death here threatened to disobedience? Those who have
   attempted to answer it, have done it very differently. Some have been
   confident, that it intends only the death of the body, or the
   separation of soul and body; to which all men are now condemned; to
   which Adam, and in him all his posterity, was sentenced, after man had
   transgressed, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Others
   suppose that a total annihilation of soul and body is intended; so that
   if the threatening had been executed without any mitigation or remedy,
   Adam and Eve would have been annihilated, and none of their posterity
   would have had actual existence. Others have thought, that by dying is
   meant their becoming totally corrupt or sinful, "dead in trespasses and
   sins," which is denominated spiritual death. The most general and
   common opinion has been, that it includes the death of the body, which
   is called temporal death, and spiritual death, and also eternal death,
   or endless misery; or as it is commonly expressed, "Death, temporal,
   spiritual, and eternal."

   Instead of attempting directly to confute all or any of these different
   opinions, or to vindicate any one of them, it is thought the most
   likely and easy way to get satisfactory evidence of the real and true
   meaning of this threatening, denounced against man, if he transgressed
   the divine prohibition, is to endeavour to find some clue which will
   lead us into it, so as to give all desirable evidence and satisfaction,
   that we have fixed on the truth. Perhaps such an one may be
   investigated. In this view, the following things must be observed, and
   carefully examined, and put together.

   First, Every transgression of God's law or command, is a crime of such
   magnitude, that no punishment is adequate and answerable to it, so as
   to express the turpitude and ill desert of the sinner, but that which
   contains infinite evil. Or every violation of the law of God is
   infinitely criminal, is an infinite moral evil; and therefore deserves
   a punishment infinitely great and dreadful, and which contains infinite
   natural evil. This has been brought into view above, and the evidence
   of it exhibited, so that it is needless to say much upon it here. That
   all sin against God is infinitely criminal, every one must grant, or be
   inconsistent with himself, who will allow that it is a greater crime
   for a child to abuse his kind, excellent father, than to injure the
   meanest servant in the family; and that the former deserves a much
   greater punishment than the latter. For by allowing this, he grants
   that the crime of abusing another, is greater or less, according to the
   degree of worth and excellency of him who is injured, and to the
   relation in which he stands to him. And this is granting that to injure
   and abuse a Being of infinite greatness, authority, dignity, worth and
   excellence, who, in the highest sense, is our father, friend and
   benefactor, must be infinitely criminal. But this is true of every sin
   against God. Therefore every sin against God, which is an injury and
   abuse offered to him, is a crime of infinite magnitude; consequently
   the sinner must be punished with infinite evil, if he has his desert.

   Again, if it be evident and certain that every criminal deserves all
   that punishment or natural evil, which his criminal deed tends to
   produce, or would certainly follow, were it not prevented by some other
   person or counteracting power, which, it is presumed, all will allow;
   then every transgression of the divine law, deserves infinite evil.
   Upon this ground a number of the laws given by Moses are founded, and
   cannot be proved to be just, if this be not admitted as a truth. It was
   commanded that if a man injured his neighbour, and brought any evil
   upon him, by depriving him of his life, limbs or senses, he should be
   punished, by suffering the same, or as great evil. "Thine eye shall
   have no pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
   hand for hand, foot for foot." [163] And it is to be observed, that not
   only he who actually did evil to another, and took away his life or any
   of his limbs, but he who attempted or aimed to do this, and did that
   which tended to effect it, though it did not actually take place, but
   was prevented, was himself to be punished with the evil, which he
   willed and designed to bring on his neighbour. [164] By the same rule,
   if a man should murder a thousand men, or will and design to do it, he
   would deserve to die a thousand deaths, or lose a thousand lives, and
   this punishment might justly be inflicted, were he capable of suffering
   it, or had so many lives to lose.

   Now, according to this, as has just been asserted, every transgression
   of the divine law deserves infinite evil. For every instance of
   opposition to God, which every sin is, is an attempt to destroy his
   being, or to take away his happiness, and make him infinitely
   miserable; to put an end to his government, and introduce universal
   confusion and misery, through the whole creation; and the rebel would
   be glad to effect all this, and would do it, were it in his power.
   Therefore he deserves to suffer infinite evil; even all the evil which
   he is capable of suffering.

   If any proposition relating to things of a moral nature be capable of
   the clearest demonstration, this is such an one. And this is a chief
   corner stone in the science of theology. Whatever is properly built
   upon it must stand, and every proposition naturally and necessarily
   following from it, or that can evidently be deduced, must be a truth.

   Secondly, It is essential to a perfect moral government, that there be
   a law pointing out and requiring what is right, and the duty of the
   subject, and threatening all transgression of it with a punishment
   exactly answerable to the crime.

   This has been considered before, and it is hoped, has been made so
   evident and certain, that every one who examines it with care and
   impartiality, will be satisfied, that it is an important truth.
   However, in addition to what has been said in support of this
   proposition, the following things may have weight.

   1. If there could be a law, and any proper moral government without a
   penalty threatening punishment to the transgressor, (which, as it has
   been observed, is impossible) yet it could not be so good and perfect a
   law and government, as that which threatens punishment to the
   disobedient, and by which the transgressor is exposed to suffer some
   evil, at least. This appears so evident, in itself, at first view, and
   is so demonstrably certain, from the many threatenings of punishment to
   transgressors in divine revelation, that there is no need of attempting
   to adduce farther evidence. If threatenings of evil to transgressors
   were not necessary in the most perfect government, they could not be
   found in the divine laws and government: Nor could that threatening
   which we are now considering have been made to man.

   2. It is necessary in order to the most perfect government, not only
   that there should be a penalty, or a law threatening evil to the
   transgressor: but that the threatened evil should be neither more nor
   less than the crime deserves.

   If the evil threatened be greater than the crime deserves, the law
   would be unjust. If it be less than the demerit of the transgressor,
   the ends of a threatened penalty will be wholly, or in a measure
   defeated; and therefore the law and government will be proportionably
   imperfect and defective. This will appear by considering what are the
   principal ends to be answered by threatening punishment.

   One end is, to deter the subject from transgressing the law, and
   prevent rebellion. Now, it is easy to see, that a greater and more
   dreadful punishment is better suited to answer this end, than a less,
   if it be not greater than the crime deserves. Therefore so far as this
   end is regarded in threatening a penalty, it will require it to be as
   great as the sin deserves; and if a law threatens a less punishment, it
   is so far defective, and not suited in the best manner to answer this
   end of a threatened penalty: Which cannot be supposed of the divine law
   and government; because that is in all respects absolutely perfect.

   Another end of the threatening is to state and express the evil nature
   of sin, and show how great the crime is, in the estimation of the
   legislator. The preceptive part of the law does not determine the ill
   desert of the transgressor. This is to be seen only in the penalty
   threatened. This determines how criminal sin is, in the sight of God;
   and what evil it deserves as a punishment. In this view, it is
   necessary that the punishment threatened should be as great, and
   contain as much evil, as sin deserves, and be exactly proportioned to
   it. By this, the law becomes the standard of truth, while it declares
   not only what is sin, but how sinful or criminal it is. It is with
   reference to this, that St. Paul says, "That sin, by the commandment,
   might become exceeding sinful." In these words he has particular
   respect to the penalty of the law or punishment threatened, by which he
   was slain, and death was wrought in him, even the death threatened to
   every transgressor; of which he speaks in the words immediately
   preceding. Sin becomes exceeding sinful, that is, appears to be
   criminal, beyond expression, by the infinite evil which the law
   threatens, as the proper desert of it. In this view, to threaten a less
   punishment would be deviating from the truth, and tend to deceive; or,
   at least, one important end of the divine law and government could not
   be answered.

   We therefore have the greatest assurance that the law of God threatens
   a punishment, exactly proportioned to the desert of sin.

   Another end to be answered in the divine government, by the penalty of
   the law, is to express the sacred authority and worthiness of the Most
   High, and the desert of sin and rebellion against him. The binding
   authority of a law, and of the lawgiver, is expressed in the
   threatening only; and in order to there being an expression of infinite
   authority, the evil threatened must be infinite; for where there is
   less authority and right to govern, a less evil may be threatened to
   disobedience, and executed; and this will be no expression of infinite
   authority. And the dignity, worthiness and importance of the
   legislator, and the greatness and ill desert of the crime, of
   transgressing the law, and despising him and his government, appear and
   are expressed in the punishment threatened to the transgressor. If
   treason against the king be threatened with no greater punishment, than
   is an attempt upon the life of a common subject, this represents the
   former to be no greater a crime than the latter; and instead of
   properly expressing the importance and dignity of the king, and the
   worth of his life, it degrades him, and sets him upon a level with all
   his subjects. The greater the evil is, which the threatening denounces
   against him who slights and opposes the Supreme Legislator, and his law
   and government, the more is his worth and excellence expressed; and the
   more fully is discovered and asserted the sacred importance and
   perfection of his law. Therefore if the law do not threaten as great a
   punishment as the crime deserves, it will not assert the greatness of
   the crime, nor the real worthiness and importance of God, and his law
   and government, but the contrary; and therefore must be a very
   imperfect, deficient law. From this, it appears most certain, that the
   infinitely distinguished and sacred authority, dignity and worthiness
   of God, and importance and excellence of his government, and infinite
   greatness of the crime and ill desert of rebellion, cannot be properly,
   and in the most clear and striking manner expressed and asserted,
   unless an infinitely great and distinguished evil be threatened to
   every transgression of the law; an evil which no other legislator ought
   to threaten, or is able to inflict: And therefore not to threaten such
   evil, or to threaten one infinitely less, is undesirable and wrong, and
   cannot be supposed of an infinitely wise and perfect government. If God
   threatens and punishes, he must threaten and punish like himself; and
   nothing short of infinite evil must be the threatened punishment.

   Another end to be answered by the penalty of the divine law, is to
   manliest and express the Legislator's infinite hatred and abhorrence of
   ail moral evil, and how much he is displeased with the sinner. God is
   certainly infinitely displeased with sin, as it opposes his being and
   infinite felicity, and all the good of the universe, and tends to
   produce infinite mischief, to involve the universe in total and eternal
   confusion and misery. His displeasure with sin and hatred of it, must
   be as great as his love of holiness, and the infinite good of the
   universe. This is therefore essential to the divine character and
   perfection, in which his glory consists; and consequently it is
   desirable, and of infinite importance that it should be manifested and
   expressed in the most clear and strongest manner, in his moral
   government, and in his law, which is the foundation and rule of it. But
   this cannot be done, by merely requiring obedience, and forbidding sin.
   In order to the expression being as clear and strong as possible, God
   must threaten sin with a punishment equal to the greatness of the
   crime, and manifest a disposition to execute the threatening, and
   inflict the punishment. To threaten sin with a less punishment than it
   deserves, is so far from expressing a proper hatred of it, that it is,
   in a degree, favouring sin and the sinner. And not to threaten any
   punishment, or to threaten only that which is infinitely less than the
   crime deserves, is to manifest infinitely less displeasure with the
   sinner, than God has, and which it becomes him to express; and it would
   be favouring the sinner infinitely too much, and discouraging, and
   tending to prevent sin, unspeakably less than is proper and necessary
   in a good and perfect government; therefore would be infinitely
   dishonourable to God, and his government: And one great and important
   end of threatening and punishing the transgressor would not be
   answered.

   And now, it must be left to the impartial, who will attentively
   consider what has been offered under this head, whether the evidence
   does not amount to a certainty, even to a clear demonstration, that in
   the most perfect moral government of God, his law must threaten evil to
   the transgressor, which is answerable to his crime, or as great as he
   deserves.

   Thirdly, The threatening under consideration, "For in the day thou
   eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die," is the threatening of the
   divine law, and must be considered as annexed or belonging to every
   divine command, and expresses the punishment which every transgression
   deserves: And therefore is a threatening of infinite evil.

   This appears from what has been observed, that there was nothing so
   special in this prohibition, that could be a reason why it should be
   attended with a peculiar and distinguished threatening. This same death
   was the threatened evil, as the punishment of the transgression of any
   command or prohibition, which was given to man; and it is mentioned
   with regard to this prohibition or command, because the penalty was
   incurred by transgressing this; and not because this was a penalty
   peculiar to this prohibition, which was not threatened for any other
   transgression, and would not have taken place on rebellion against any
   other command, whether moral or positive.

   We have an absolute certainty of this, two ways.

   1. From what has been proved under the observation preceding that, now
   under consideration, viz. That in the best and most perfect government,
   which the moral government of God certainly is, the penalty threatened
   in the law to the transgressor of it, must be as great an evil as the
   crime deserves. This prohibition, or command, was contained in the law
   given to man; it was the law of God, and therefore disobedience to it,
   deserved as great a punishment, as disobedience to other commands; and
   indeed, offending in this one point, was sinning against the whole law,
   and every command in it: But every sin, every act of disobedience,
   deserves infinite evil; hence it follows, with the greatest certainty,
   that this is a threatening of a punishment, which involves infinite
   evil, the just desert of every sin.

   2. That the death here threatened implies and intends endless misery,
   we may be very certain, in that such an evil is intended by death and
   dying, in other parts of divine revelation. This is always meant by
   death, or dying, when these words are used to denote the penalty of the
   divine law, or the punishment which impenitent sinners will suffer, on
   whom the threatened penalty will fall, without mitigation. Any one may
   know this, who attends well to the Bible. How often are these words
   used in this sense by the prophet Ezekiel, in the 3d, 18th, and 33d
   chapters of his prophecy? It is there repeatedly said, that the
   impenitent, wicked man shall die, and surely die, the very words of the
   threatening under consideration: which death the penitent shall escape.
   It must therefore mean the sufferings for his sins in a future state.
   Christ saith, he that eateth his flesh, shall not die. Verily, verily,
   I say unto you. If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
   Whosoever believeth in me, shall never die. [165] Here, not to die,
   does not mean there shall not be a separation between soul and body:
   for none escape this; but, dying is put in opposition to eternal life,
   and therefore must mean eternal death, or endless punishment. St. Paul
   says, "the wages of sin is death." The wages of sin is the proper
   punishment of sin, or that which sin deserves. By this he fixes the
   meaning of the original threatening, and shews what is intended by
   death or dying, when threatened as the penalty of a divine law. And
   that by death here is meant eternal death, or endless punishment is
   certain, because he puts it in opposition to eternal life. "The wages
   of sin is death: But the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus
   Christ our Lord." [166] He speaks of death in the preceding verses, as
   the end and consequence of sin, and puts it in opposition to life. He
   says, "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: But if ye, through the
   spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." [167] Here he
   means by dying, perishing forever, in opposition to living forever; or
   endless misery, opposed to endless happiness. This fixes the meaning of
   dying, as the fruit, consequence and wages of sin; and is the same
   threatening with that under consideration, in the same words, ye shall
   die. If there be need of any farther confirmation of this point, it may
   be observed, that endless misery or infinite evil, the punishment which
   sin deserves, is expressly called death, or dying. [168] "But the
   fearful and unbelieving, &:c. shall have their part in the lake which
   burneth with fire and brimstone, Which is the second death." What can
   be more certain, than that the first threatening to man, if he sinned,
   "Thou shalt surely die," did express the proper penalty or wages due to
   sin, even endless misery, or infinite evil, since this is expressed
   often in other parts of scripture in the same language, and more than
   once in the same words? If the Bible may be allowed to explain itself,
   the matter is clearly decided.

   Must not every one who will attend to what has now been brought into
   view on this point, be left without a doubt about the meaning of the
   original threatening, "Thou shalt surely die?" Is it not as
   demonstrably certain that it is a threatening of all the evil that sin
   deserves, even endless punishment, which is the second death, as any
   proposition in theology is, or can be?

   This point being established beyond all controversy, that the
   threatening made to man, if he eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree,
   denounced the evil which sin deserves; and which was equally applicable
   to the transgression of any other precept; and therefore was a
   threatening of infinite evil, or complete and endless destruction; the
   following inferences necessarily follow; viz.

   I. That temporal death, or separation between soul and body, is not the
   whole or the chief of die evil contained in the threatening. This is
   not an infinite evil; but a very inconsiderable one, compared with what
   sin deserves: Therefore something infinitely more dreadful must be
   implied in the threatening; even that which in scripture is called the
   second death, which is endless misery.

   2. It farther follows, that separation of soul and body is no part of
   the punishment threatened. The death threatened was quite of a
   different kind, and not only does not include, but necessarily
   excludes, separation of soul and body. Had the punishments taken place
   and been executed without any mitigation; or had there been no reprieve
   and redemption for man, this separation of soul and body could not have
   taken place: Because the punishment deserved, and therefore the
   punishment threatened was, evil to the whole man, or to the man made up
   of soul and body. This creature, consisting of body and soul, which
   were essential constituent parts of the man, was threatened, and if he
   sinned, was to be punished; and not one part only, while the other is
   taken down and annihilated. Therefore, this could not take place,
   consistent with the full execution of the threatening. It is not so
   great an evil for the mind only to suffer, as it is to be miserable, or
   to suffer evil, in body and soul: The man is capable of suffering
   unspeakable evil or pain in his body; therefore, this suffering must be
   included in the threatening. And this proves, that separation of soul
   and body, could not be the subject of a threatening, that is, could not
   be threatened: For this would not have been an evil, in that case, but
   a negative good, which cannot be the subject of a threatening, but
   rather of a promise; for evil only can be threatened, and not good,
   negative, or positive. Separation of body and soul would have been a
   mitigation of punishment, and would have rendered man, not capable of
   suffering so much, as in body and soul united; therefore could not be
   threatened as a punishment, it being no part or kind of punishment, but
   the contrary. And under that constitution, under which the threatening
   w as made, there was no provision for a reunion if a separation once
   took place; nor was it indeed possible there should be a reunion, if a
   separation was threatened as a punishment, and had the threatening been
   executed. Is it not hence evident to a certainty, that separation of
   soul and body could not have taken place, had man been punished for
   disobedience, according to the threatening; and therefore this was not
   included in the threatening, but on the contrary, was necessarily
   excluded?

   If any should say, as some indeed have said, that we learn what was
   intended by the threatening, by the sentence that was pronounced on
   man, after he had transgressed; which was nothing worse than temporal
   death: The reply will be. That it is a great mistake to suppose that
   the body of man, being doomed to return to the dust, and the
   appointment of a separation between soul and body, is pronouncing a
   sentence upon him, answerable to the threatening; as there is not the
   least evidence or appearance of this, but the contrary, in the account
   which is given of it, all taken together. When man had sinned, God
   appeared, and called him before him, and brought him to a confession of
   his sin. And then, instead of inflicting the threatened penalty upon
   him, he declared his design to reprieve him from the punishment
   threatened, and to exercise pardoning mercy; and promised a redemption,
   by which Satan should be defeated in his design, in tempting man to
   rebel, in the following words, to the serpent, "I will put enmity
   between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: It shall
   bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." God having thus
   promised relief and redemption by the seed of the woman, proceeds to
   declare what shall take place in consequence of man's apostasy; and the
   introduction of a Saviour, viz. That the ground should be cursed for
   his sake, and bring forth thorns and thistles; so that in the sweat of
   his face, and in sorrow, he should obtain and eat his bread, till his
   body should return to the ground from whence it was taken. That is,
   this should be an evil, sorrowful world to him, and he should leave
   this state, and pass into the invisible world by a separation of soul
   and body, by the latter returning to its original dust.

   This new constitution and appointment is introduced in consequence of
   the apostasy of man, and the promised redemption by Christ, wisely
   ordered to answer important ends in the new state of probation, into
   which man was now brought; and at the game time, to be a constant
   admonition to man, that he was a sinner, and had hereby incurred the
   displeasure of his Maker; and of his desert of endless destruction, and
   the certainty of its coming upon him, unless he be interested in the
   benefits of redemption. And it was necessary it should take place, as
   the best way in which man should pass out of this state of probation
   into the invisible state, so as to continue that state invisible, where
   both the redeemed, and those who die in their sins, are lodged and
   remain, until the general resurrection; when the body and soul shall be
   reunited, not to be separated again. And as this separation of soul and
   body, in which the latter becomes a ghastly, loathsome spectacle, and
   returns to corruption, and is a certain introduction to endless misery,
   the second death, to all who have no interest in the Redeemer, it is a
   striking visible emblem of endless destruction, and is connected with
   it to all who die ungodly; it has therefore obtained the name of death,
   though it be not death in the original sense of the word; eternal
   destruction being the only proper and real death of a moral agent,
   sinning against God: Therefore this is called the second death, after
   separation of soul and body had obtained the name of death, and with
   reference to that.

   And as the body's returning to dust, is no part of the death
   threatened, and is not the real and true death of a rational creature,
   it is frequently represented in scripture, not to be real death; but
   persons are represented as escaping death and not dying, who are the
   subjects of this separation of soul and body, and do die in this sense.
   Thus in the forementioned chapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel, it is
   repeatedly said, that the penitent obedient sinner, shall not die. His
   body must return to dust, as do the bodies of the wicked, yet he should
   not die. Therefore this is not death. It is not the death threatened to
   the wicked, nor the death which the righteous escape: Therefore not
   death in the original and most proper sense of the word.

   Solomon says, "Righteousness delivereth from death. In the way of
   righteousness is life, and in the pathway thereof there is no death."
   But the bodies of the righteous return to dust. Therefore this is not
   death. Our Saviour speaks the same language, and says, "Whosoever
   believeth in me, shall never die: shall not die, but live forever."
   Believing in him does not prevent their bodies returning to dust:
   Therefore this is not death; it is not the death threatened for sin,
   and is not the proper wages of it; and is not the death from which
   Christ came to deliver men; for there would have been no separation of
   soul and body, had he not undertaken to redeem man. He delivers from
   the second death, the only real death of a rational creature: which was
   therefore threatened to disobedience, and will take place in its full
   meaning after the day of judgment; of which the death of the body is
   but a shadow.

   This leads to observe, as a farther evidence that the separation of
   soul and body is no part of the curse threatened in the divine law,
   that when this curse or threatened punishment shall be executed on
   those who die in their sins, and are not redeemed, soul and body shall
   be united, and they shall be miserable forever, both in soul and body,
   in union. The proper and full execution of the threatening does not
   take place, but is suspended by reason of the redemption, which brings
   man into a state of probation, until that is finished. During this time
   the wicked, who by the death of the body go out of this world into the
   invisible state, are represented in scripture, to be in prison, as
   criminals, waiting for the pronouncing and execution of the sentence
   against them, at the day of judgment: and then the threatening will be
   executed. We must therefore look there, to see what the curse of the
   law is, and what is meant by death when threatened as the proper
   punishment of sin; and this will assure us it is the second death, even
   that infinite evil included in the last sentence, "Depart, ye cursed,
   into everlasting fire."

   Thus evident and certain it appears to be, that the law and
   constitution under which man was made, knew not of separation of soul
   and body, nor did admit of it; and that the death with which he was
   threatened, if he failed of perfect obedience to every divine command,
   was endless punishment, in his whole person, soul and body: And that
   this separation of soul and body was introduced and took place, under a
   new dispensation of grace by a Redeemer, as peculiar to that, and to
   answer important ends respecting it; and when that is over and
   completed, this separation shall cease, and all mankind will be united
   to their bodies again, in which the redeemed shall be happy forever;
   and the wicked suffer the penalty of the law, in everlasting misery, in
   soul and body united. In short, the dissolution of the body could not
   take place, unless man had sinned; nor then, if the threatening had
   been executed without remedy; and unless a new dispensation of grace
   had been introduced, and man had been reprieved, and put into a new
   state of probation, under a Redeemer. Both these must take place, the
   sin and rebellion of man, and redemption by a Mediator, in order to
   separation of soul and body being proper, necessary, or possible,
   consistent with the divine law. They therefore must have been greatly
   mistaken, who have thought and asserted that this was all that was
   threatened in the divine law, or as the penalty of eating of the
   forbidden fruit. And they have made as real a mistake who have supposed
   that turning the body to dust is included in the threatening, or any
   part of it, since the contrary is evidently true, viz. that the
   threatening necessarily excludes it.

   3. From what has been said on this subject, it may be inferred with the
   greatest certainty, that death in the original threatening, does not
   mean annihilation, or an end to existence, as some have supposed: For
   this would be an infinitely less evil than sin deserves; which has been
   proved cannot be the penalty threatened in the divine law, because a
   good and perfect law must threaten a punishment equal to the crime in
   transgressing it. Besides, it has been shown that death and dying is
   never used in this sense, when it denotes the punishment or proper
   wages of sin. And the second death, which evidently means the death
   threatened to Adam, is expressly said to consist in positive, sensible
   punishment or pain, which is perpetual and endless, where they rest not
   day or night, and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and
   ever.

   4. It appears from what has been said, as well as from other
   considerations, that what is called spiritual death, a going into a
   course of total sinfulness and rebellion, is not the death threatened,
   when God said to man, "Thou shall surely die."

   This is evident, in that it cannot be the evil which sin deserves, or
   the proper punishment of it. A man may be wholly a rebel and totally
   sinful, or contrary to the law of God, in all his exercises and
   conduct: and yet not be totally miserable. Of this we have evidence
   enough before our eyes. But rebellion deserves complete and endless
   misery, and must be therefore threatened, as has been proved. Besides,
   if going into a course of total rebellion were necessarily attended
   with complete and endless pain and misery; the punishment or the evil
   threatened, is the attendant, natural evil, pain and misery, and not
   the sin and rebellion itself.

   This leads to observe, that sin and rebellion, or transgression of the
   divine law, cannot be the proper matter of a threatening, as a
   punishment of transgression, and the evil to be inflicted for it. For
   this is the evil or crime, for which punishment is threatened, and not
   the punishment itself. This is the crime threatened with a punishment,
   and not the punishment threatened. Moral evil, or sin and rebellion, is
   always criminal, in every instance and degree of it; and this deserves
   punishment, and this only can be punished. The punishment therefore
   cannot be sin itself, or moral evil; for to suppose this is to confound
   the crime and punishment, as one and the same thing, and to threaten a
   crime with the commission of a crime. The proper and only punishment of
   sin or moral evil, is natural evil, or pain and suffering; and this
   alone can be the proper matter of a threatening.

   If sinning and rebellion be a punishment, then the first act of sin of
   which the man was guilty was a punishment, as really as any after acts;
   but this could not be a punishment, unless man was punished for his
   antecedent innocence: And therefore could not be threatened as a
   punishment. Besides, to threaten any one, that if he transgressed once,
   he should be left to his pleasure to go on in sin, and do nothing but
   sin, would be really no threatening, or a very improper one, and no
   more than to say, if he did sin, he should sin, and go on to do that
   which should be most agreeable to him, and so long as he should choose
   to do so, and no longer. Punishment is suffering some evil; and which
   is an evil in his sight on whom it is inflicted, and in which he is
   passive: Therefore man cannot be properly punished, by that in which he
   is not a patient, and really suffers nothing: but is altogether active
   in it, and chooses it as a good, in itself considered; which is true of
   every degree of sin. Therefore, in this view of it, it cannot be
   threatened as a punishment; for it really is none, as it has not the
   nature of a punishment.

   God is said in scripture, in several instances, to give men up to
   gratify their lusts and to strong delusion, and to walk in their own
   ways, [169] in consequence of their having chosen to rebel against him.
   But this is not threatened as a punishment, nor said to be such; and
   for reasons just mentioned, we may be sure they are not to be
   considered as such, but only as instances of God's just and wise
   conduct, to answer important ends in his moral government. By the sins
   they commit who are thus abandoned to sin, they are prepared for
   punishment, and go on to it; but they are not the punishment itself;
   this consists in the destruction, the natural evil which they suffer
   for the sins which they are suffered, and given up to commit. It is
   thus expressed by St. Paul; "For this cause God shall send them strong
   delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they ail might be
   damned, who believed not the truth; but had pleasure in
   unrighteousness." And when he speaks of the heathen being given up by
   God to vile affections, and says that in this way, "They received in
   themselves that recompense of their error which was meet," he is not be
   understood to mean, that the exercise of these lusts, or their sinning
   as they did, was the recompense or punishment for their former sins;
   but this recompense consisted in the shame and disgrace, pain and
   misery, which were the proper, meet and constituted attendants and
   consequence of their vile practices. Nor does he say that this natural
   evil or unhappiness, which in this life attended, or followed their
   ways of sin, was the proper and adequate punishment of their crimes.
   For he goes on to observe, that they knew, or were under advantages to
   know, that the sins of which they were guilty deserved death; by which
   is meant neither temporal nor spiritual death; but eternal destruction,
   the second death, the death threatened, as the proper and full
   punishment of sin, when moral government was first instituted, and man
   was put under law. His words are, "Who knowing the judgment of God,
   that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the
   same, but have pleasure in them that do them." [170] He proceeds in the
   next chapter to speak of that punishment of the sinner, which he here
   says is death, according to the revealed, known judgment of God. We are
   sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them which
   commit such things. "And thinkest thou, O man, who doest these things,
   that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? But after thy hardness and
   impenitent heart, treasurest up wrath, against the day of wrath, and
   the revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to
   every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient continuance in
   well doing, seek for glory, honour and immortality: Eternal life: But
   unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey
   unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon
   every soul of man, that doth evil." In these words he clearly, and in
   the most decisive manner, declares what that death is of which sinners
   are worthy, according to the judgment of God, and which will be
   inflicted on the finally impenitent. It consists in suffering the wrath
   of God, which shall be poured on the heads of the wicked after the day
   of judgment: And this indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish,
   is set in opposition to eternal life, which the redeemed shall enjoy:
   therefore must be without end. This death therefore is not temporal,
   nor spiritual death, nor annihilation; but endless existence in misery,
   suffering that evil which is the wages of sin, and is infinitely worse
   than non-existence.

   If all natural evil, that is, unhappiness, pain and suffering, could be
   separated from sin, and the sinner could have all the enjoyment and
   happiness he desires and seeks in the way of sin, it would be no
   sensible punishment, and really no punishment at all to him; but in his
   view, it would be a real good, perfectly agreeable to his desire and
   choice, to be allowed to go on in sin; and the contrary would be the
   object of his greatest aversion, and the greatest evil to him.
   Therefore there can be no propriety or reason in threatening him, to
   give him up to walk in his own ways, and do nothing but sin. This
   indeed could not be a threatening to him, but would be considered by
   him as a precious promise of good.

   It will perhaps be said, that though living in sin be not an evil in
   the view of the sinner, but a desirable good; yet to innocent man, and
   in the perfect exercise of holiness, to whom this threatening was
   pronounced if he transgressed, sin appeared to be the greatest evil;
   and therefore nothing worse to him could be threatened, than spiritual
   death, which consists wholly in sin.

   Upon this it may be observed, that we cannot reasonably infer from
   this, that spiritual death or sinning was threatened as the punishment
   of sin; because, for the reasons that have been given, there is an
   impropriety in such a threatening, as it is only threatening that if he
   did sin, he should continue to sin if he chose it, and be left wholly
   at liberty to do as he pleased. And this is really no threatening, for
   it is no punishment to do and to have what we choose. But this is all
   that would be threatened in this case, that if he once chose to sin, he
   should be suffered to sin hereafter, without being counteracted or
   interrupted. Besides, the first sin was as great an evil to innocent,
   holy man, as any after sin, and the most dreadful, as it was connected
   with all after sin, and introduced it. There is the same reason,
   therefore, why the first transgression should be considered, and
   threatened as a punishment, which is given, that any after sin should
   be so considered, and threatened. It will be said, this could not be,
   as it was improper and impossible. But it may be said with as much
   reason, that it was improper and really impossible to threaten any
   after sin, or any degree of it, as a punishment of the first sin, which
   appears from what has been said.

   When the apostle Paul says, "sin revived, and I died," he does not mean
   what is called a spiritual death, for this consists in sin, or is sin
   itself: But Paul distinguishes the death he died from sin, and speaks
   of it as the effect of sin. Sin by the law slew him; and sin wrought
   and produced death, i.e. brought him under the curse of the law. He
   died, that is, found himself dead, being under the threatening and
   curse of that law which was given to Adam, and denounced death upon the
   transgressor, even eternal destruction. Is not the death originally
   threatened, clearly stated by this apostle?

   It is granted that in a few passages of scripture, those who are wholly
   inclined to sin, and so under the dominion of sin, are said to be dead;
   and the word death is perhaps sometimes used to denote such a state.
   But when these words are used in this sense, they are evidently used
   not to express the punishment of sin; and have no reference to the
   original threatening, or any thing of that kind. To be dead, in this
   sense, is always mentioned as a crime, and not as a punishment of any
   crime.

   5. On the whole, it appears from what has been said on this question,
   respecting the death threatened to the disobedience of man, that it
   means a being separated from all natural good and happiness, unto all
   natural evil or misery; continuing in endless, miserable existence,
   suffering the just punishment of sin against God. This is to die in the
   highest and most proper sense; and is the only death with which a
   rational moral agent can be threatened or punished, so as fully and
   properly to express the true desert of sin, and answer the ends of
   moral government.

   This is the original and proper meaning of the word death, and of
   dying, and no other idea was affixed to it, when the threatening was
   denounced to man; and he was doubtless made to understand it, when the
   law was made known to him, if he needed any particular instruction, in
   order to know the meaning of the threatening. And when the separation
   of soul and body, which took place after man had sinned, and was
   restored to a new state of probation, was called death, to distinguish
   the death here threatened from that, it is called the second death,
   which is suspended, and will not take place till redemption is
   finished, and soul and body are restored to their original union, by
   the general resurrection.

   Having inquired and found what was the penalty threatened to the
   transgressor of the law, under which man was made; it is now to be
   considered, whether any promise of reward was given to him, if he
   continued perfectly obedient.

   What has been said to prove that the angels had a time of trial of
   their obedience, and a promise of eternal life, if they continued
   obedient through the time of trial, [171] is equally applicable to man,
   and as full a proof that the latter was not only secure in happiness
   and the favour of God, so long as he continued obedient; but had a time
   of trial appointed him, with a promise that upon his persevering in
   obedience to the end of that time, he should be confirmed in holiness
   and the favour of God. But there is a particular and decisive evidence
   of this, with respect to man, which we have not in the instance of the
   angels. This is, the tree of life, which was planted in the midst of
   the garden, and what is said of it. The name of this tree is
   significant, and points out the design and use of it. It was called the
   tree of life, because by partaking of the fruit of it, man was to have
   eternal life confirmed to him, of which this was the appointed pledge
   or seal. This is made certain by what is said respecting it, after man
   had transgressed, viz. that man was not suffered to continue in the
   garden, but was driven out of it, "lest he should put forth his hand,
   and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever." This
   cannot be understood, without supposing that the fruit of this tree,
   and man's partaking of it, was the appointed sign and pledge of eternal
   life, or the seal of a promise that he should live forever. Man having
   sinned, and forfeited the promise, it was not proper that he should
   partake of this constituted pledge of eternal life, or continue in a
   situation, in which there was a possibility of his eating of this
   fruit. Agreeable to this, and with allusion to it, Christ says, "To him
   that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the
   midst of the paradise of God," which is a promise of eternal life.
   [172] This is still farther confirmed by what St. Paul says of the law
   given to man, in his primitive state, viz. that it was ordained unto
   life. [173] And that he that doeth the things required in it, shall
   live by them. [174] This must refer to the original law given to man
   when innocent, or before he sinned; for no such law could be ordained
   to life, or propose and promise life on this condition, since sin took
   place, it being impossible that man, since the first apostasy, should
   obtain life in this way. This the apostle observes in the passages just
   quoted. "The commandment, which was ordained unto life, I found to be
   unto death. For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the
   curse: For it is written, cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all the things written in the book of the law to do them." Therefore
   the law given to man in his primitive state, which threatened death to
   the transgressor, and cursed him, promised eternal life to him upon
   perfect obedience. And as he sinned, and so failed of obtaining this
   life by obedience, the death and curse threatened to disobedience is
   come upon him.

   We are not expressly told how long man was to continue in obedience,
   before he might eat of the tree of life, and have eternal life made
   sure to him: Nor why he might not, and did not, eat of the fruit of the
   tree directly, and put an end to his probation state, and have eternal
   life sealed to him. But we may be certain there was some wise
   appointment and regulation concerning this. And perhaps we are not left
   to mere conjecture about it. Is it not very probable, if not beyond a
   doubt, that this tree of life had no fruit on it, when this transaction
   took place, and the promise was made; or the fruit had not come to
   maturity, so as to be eaten: And that man was told, that if he
   continued obedient till ripe fruit was on that tree he should then eat
   of it, as a token and pledge of eternal life, being made sure to him?
   This fixed the time of his probation, in the wisest and best manner.
   Man could not tell the hour nor day in which he might eat of this tree,
   and be confirmed; but he might see the fruit growing, and ripening
   every day, which would be a constant and growing motive and
   encouragement to perseverance. Man sinned before the fruit of this tree
   was produced and ripe; and therefore was not allowed to live where it
   might be possible for him to take and eat of it, when there should be
   ripe fruit on this tree.

   Thus it appears that the law, or moral constitution under which man was
   placed, was of the nature of a cove7iant between his Creator and him;
   man's duty, or what God required of him, was stated, and the penalty of
   failing of his duty was fixed by the law with a promise of eternal
   life, on condition of his obedience through the time of trial, which
   was appointed. And man consented to this law and constitution, as good
   and excellent, and stood engaged to perform the condition, on which he
   should obtain the promised reward. This he must be supposed to do: for
   not to do it, when it was revealed to him by God, would be rebellion
   against his sovereign.

   It has been observed, that the moral law, which is essential to moral
   government, and by which man was bound as soon as he existed a moral
   agent, is epitomised by Christ, who says it requires nothing but love,
   to love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves. It
   hence appears, as well as from the reason of the case, that this law
   respects the heart, or wall and affections. It is with the heart, in
   the exercise of perfect love, that this law is obeyed; and the smallest
   contrariety to this love, in the exercises of the heart, or the least
   defect in the degree and strength of it, is a violation of this law,
   and must bring the curse or penalty on the transgressor. If there be no
   degree of exercise of love in the heart, there is no obedience to this
   law: and where this love is exercised constantly in a perfect manner
   and degree, or without any defect, there is perfect obedience. This
   docs indeed necessarily imply, that this love is expressed in all
   proper ways, in external conduct, so far as it is in the power, and
   under the government of the will; but the obedience consists wholly in
   the exercises of the heart or will, producing what is external, in
   proper expressions of love. And where there is no love exercised in the
   heart, there is no real obedience or holiness, whatever be the external
   appearance, in words or conduct. The resolving the whole law into love
   by Christ, and St. Paul's saying that love is the fulfilling of the
   law, and that without love he was nothing, whatever were his external
   conduct, sufficiently establish this point, if it were not capable of
   demonstration from the reason and nature of things.

   This law being founded in reason, and as perfect and excellent as is
   the moral government of an infinitely wise and good Being, must be, in
   its own nature, unchangeable; so that it cannot be abrogated or set
   aside, or abated; nor can any moral agent be released from obligation
   to obey it constantly and perfectly. There may be particular positive
   precepts given on special occasions, and with reference to particular
   circumstances; which may not be always binding, but may be temporary,
   and cease to be in force, when the end of them is answered, and the
   reason of their being given ceases. The law requiring love to God and
   to our neighbour will oblige man to obey all such positive temporary
   commands, while the reason of these injunctions continues; but when the
   reason of them ceases, they become obsolete, and the obligation to obey
   them is at an end. Many of the laws given to Israel by Moses are
   instances and an illustration of this. But the law requiring love is
   reasonable and binding on all, at all times, and cannot cease or be
   made void in any degree. The least disregard paid to it, even in
   thought or heart by a moral agent, for one moment, in any
   circumstances, must be wrong and criminal. And it would be infinitely
   wrong, were it possible, as it is not, for the Legislator and Governor
   of the world, to express or show any disregard to this law, and not to
   support and maintain it at all times, and in every respect, by all his
   authority.

   Therefore the penalty of it must always be regarded as reasonable,
   important and sacred, it being an essential part of the law, and
   necessary in order to guard, support and enforce it, and clothe it with
   the authority of the supreme Legislator. A disposition not to execute
   the threatening, or to mitigate the punishment; and consequently the
   manifestation of such a disposition would be infinitely unreasonable
   and wrong, as it would be dishonourable to a most reasonable and
   righteous law, worthy to be maintained and honoured; and which must be
   regarded and supported, in order to exercise moral government in the
   best manner. In the most perfect and excellent government, the penalty
   of the law must be as much regarded and supported as the precept;
   because to disregard, abate, or set aside the former, is equally
   shewing disrespect to the latter, and really repealing it. A proper
   regard cannot be shewn to the penalty, without manifesting a
   disposition and determination to punish agreeable to the threatening,
   by inflicting infinite evil for transgression, and actually punishing
   so as to answer all the ends of the penalty, and fully support the
   threatening.

   Jn what particular way and manner this law was communicated to man,
   with all the positive precepts which were given to him, we are not
   informed. It appears that God conversed familiarly with him; but
   whether he put on a bodily shape, and appeared like a man, or what was
   the appearance, or the way in which he communicated to Adam the
   commands and instructions which he revealed, cannot be certainly
   determined. However, we are certain this was done in the most wise and
   proper way; and so as that man had clear and decisive evidence that his
   Maker did converse with him, and understood all that was said or
   revealed to him, respecting the moral government under which he was
   placed, the covenant made with him, and the state of probation, into
   which he was put, and when it should be ended, &c.

   Adam, when he first came into existence, though in a state of manhood
   and maturity, as to his faculties of body and mind, stood in need of
   instruction, and doubtless had the knowledge of many things
   communicated to him by immediate inspiration, or otherways from his
   Maker, as he could have no other instructor. Among these the knowledge
   of language was one; and how to communicate ideas by words. He was not
   left to learn this art, and form a language without help, but had the
   immediate assistance of God.

   In this transaction between God the Creator and Governor, and man the
   creature, in which the law, with the promises and threatenings of it,
   was declared and established in the form of a covenant between God and
   man, Adam was considered and treated as comprehending all mankind. He
   being, by divine constitution, the natural head and father of the whole
   race, they were all included and created in him, as one whole, which
   could not be separated: And therefore he is treated as the whole in
   this transaction. The covenant made with him was made with all mankind,
   and he was constituted the public and confederating head of the whole
   race of men, and acted in this capacity, as being the whole; and his
   obedience was considered as the obedience of mankind; and as by this,
   Adam was to obtain eternal life, had he performed it, this comprehended
   and insured the eternal life of all his posterity. And, on the
   contrary, his disobedience was the disobedience of the whole of all
   mankind; and the threatened penalty did not respect Adam personally, or
   as a single individual; but his whole posterity, included in him, and
   represented by him. Therefore the transgression, being the
   transgression of the whole, brought the threatened punishment on all
   mankind.

   This point will be more particularly considered, explained and proved
   in a following chapter; but it seems proper to bring it into view in
   this place, in order to give a clear and full representation of the law
   and moral government, under which man was originally placed. That Adam
   was considered and treated in this respect, as being, or comprehending
   all mankind, is evident, in that almost every thing which is said to
   him, in the three first chapters of Genesis, has respect to the whole
   race of mankind, and not to Adam personally; and is spoken to them, or
   of them. The first time man is mentioned, it evidently means mankind,
   and not any particular man. [175] "And God said. Let us make man, and
   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." By man here must be meant
   mankind, which is denoted by the following words, "And let them have
   dominion over the whole earth," that is, mankind; the whole human race.
   All mankind were created, in creating the first man; for they were all
   included in him, and to be propagated from him, and arise and grow out
   of him, as the branches of a tree are included in the original stock,
   root or seed. God in creating the first herbs and trees, with the seed
   in themselves to propagate their kind, really created all the herbs and
   trees which shall exist to the end of the world. So he created all
   mankind, in creating the first man; and in giving dominion to him, he
   gave dominion to all. They were all made like him, in kind, and their
   state, condition and circumstances were fixed, as much as that of the
   race of plants and trees. All mankind were created in the image of God,
   and to them was given dominion over all the earth. "And God blessed
   them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the
   earth, and subdue it." This blessing and this command respected
   mankind, and not the first man personally, in distinction from the
   rest; for he alone was not to fill the earth, and subdue it, but the
   human race. God is therefore represented as blessing them all, and
   speaking to them all, and not to a single person. It hence appears,
   that the posterity of Adam were so connected with him, and included in
   him, that they might properly be considered as one; and that he was so
   far the head, and representing father of the whole, that in creating
   him all mankind were created, and in blessing him, all were blessed;
   and what was said to him, and done for him, was said to, and done for
   the human race; that the law given, and covenant made with him, with
   the blessing and the curse, the promise and the threatening, was given
   to all, and made with all, having respect to all mankind, included in
   their father and head: And what he did as a moral agent, was done for
   them, as much as himself; so that they, even the whole human race, must
   share equally with him an his obedience, and the promised, consequent
   blessing, or in his disobedience, and the curse. But the evidence and
   certainty of this, is more fully established, by what took place, and
   has been revealed since the apostasy of man. What God said to Adam
   after he had sinned, was said to, and of all mankind; and the calamity
   or evil to which he was doomed in this world, as the consequence of his
   transgression, equally falls upon his posterity. "And unto Adam he
   said, Because thou hast eaten, &c. Cursed is the ground for thy sake;
   in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. In the sweat
   of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground: For
   out of it was thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
   return." As this sentence, "Unto dust shalt thou return," did not
   respect Adam only, but all his posterity, we are naturally, if not
   necessarily led to understand the same language in the threatening, as
   having respect to all mankind, "In the day thou eatest thereof thou
   shalt surely die." But this is reduced to a certainty by St. Paul.
   [176] "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
   by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
   Through the offence of one, many are dead. By the offence of one,
   judgment came upon all men to condemnation. By one man's disobedience
   many were made sinners." Here Adam is asserted, in the most plain and
   strongest terms, to be constituted the public covenanting head of
   mankind, so that sin, condemnation and death, came upon all his
   posterity, by his disobedience. The threatening, therefore, respected
   all mankind, and consequently the promises did also. And all depended
   on Adam's conduct, to determine whether his posterity should be holy
   and happy forever, or sinners and miserable.--But this subject will be
   more particularly considered in the next chapter.

   This covenant or constitution, in which Adam was considered and
   treated, as the father and public head of his future posterity, was
   more than mere law: and in this respect different from the covenant
   made with the angels. It is supposed they acted every one for himself,
   and that they all existed at once, and there was no such peculiar union
   between them, like that between the first man and his posterity, which
   rendered such a constitution with respect to the latter, proper and
   wise; yea, necessary, in order to the exercise of the most perfect and
   excellent moral government.

   Should any object to this, and say, that as the posterity of Adam had
   no opportunity to consent to this constitution, it was not consistent
   with wisdom or righteousness to include them in it, and fix it for
   them. And as it was not the best and most likely way for them to obtain
   eternal happiness, by making it depend on the conduct of the first man,
   it was not consistent with goodness, and really unjust, and injurious
   to mankind. In answer to this, it must be observed,

   1. The creature has no right to object to any law or constitution which
   God sees fit to make respecting him; but is obliged to acquiesce in
   what he orders. God has a right to prescribe the particular method in
   which he will govern his creatures, and this belongs to him; and for a
   creature not to approve and consent to what God prescribes, is
   rebellion against his Maker. Therefore there was no need to wait, to
   see if Adam's posterity would approve of such a constitution, before it
   could be with justice and propriety fixed for them. This therefore
   cannot be the ground of a reasonable objection. Indeed, if it can be
   proved to be an unjust, or unwise constitution, we may be sure no such
   constitution was ever made by the Governor of man. This brings to
   observe,

   2. Such a constitution does not appear, and cannot be proved not to be
   just and good. There was as great a prospect and probability, that the
   first man would not sin, but persevere in obedience, as that any one of
   his posterity would; yea, much greater, seeing he was created an adult,
   in the full exercise of all his rational faculties: whereas they must
   come into existence infants, and gradually rise to manhood, through the
   weak state of childhood and youth, in which they would be more exposed
   to fall by temptation. And the father of mankind had a strong motive to
   obedience, which none can have who only act for themselves, as the
   interest of all his posterity was put into his hands, and he acted for
   them all. Before the consequence was known, had any one, capable of
   viewing all circumstances, been to judge, he would doubtless have
   concluded that such a constitution was the most eligible, and the best
   that could be formed for mankind, and most likely to secure their
   holiness and happiness. Now the event has proved to be evil, and by
   this constitution, Adam and his posterity are fallen into a state of
   ruin, we may view it as bad, and injurious to us; especially since we
   are become prejudiced against the dictates of wisdom, and enemies to
   the wise and good government of Jehovah. But this is not the least
   evidence that it is not wise and good. Mankind, while in a state of
   rebellion, are disposed to think and say, "The ways of the Lord are not
   equal." And they will find fault with any constitution, which infinite
   wisdom and goodness can form. Witness their disapprobation of the
   gospel, and opposition to it. It ill becomes those who choose to live
   in sin, and when they have the offer of pardon, and deliverance from
   sin, and of eternal life, will not accept of it, but spurn it from
   them, to find fault and complain that they were originally placed under
   a constitution, by which they are fallen into that sin and ruin, from
   which they cannot be persuaded to accept deliverance, but choose to
   live in sin, as a privilege, and constantly approve of the original
   transgression, by obstinately persisting in that rebellion, which their
   first father began, when he sinned.

   3. It must be observed, that if it could be proved, as it cannot, that
   such a constitution was not the most favourable to every individual, it
   will not follow that it is not, on the whole, the wisest and best
   constitution that could be formed. If no injustice be done to any one
   by it, and it be best suited to answer the most wise and important
   ends, it is certainly the best possible constitution. If it were
   evident that mankind did not enjoy so great advantages to be holy and
   happy forever, under such a constitution as they would have under some
   other, it does not follow that any injustice is done to them; for they
   had no right to these advantages; and God was not obliged to grant
   them: If he were, there could be no state of trial, and eternal life
   must be made sure to them all, which God was able to do. But this would
   not be wise, it would not have been suited to answer the most important
   ends, and for the greatest general good. Therefore if this constitution
   is suited to answer these ends, and is the best that could be for the
   general good, then it is the wisest and best that could be devised.
   There is certainly no evidence that it is not so: But abundant evidence
   of the contrary, which may more fully appear by what is farther to be
   said on the subject, in attending to the consequences of this
   constitution, or the ends actually answered by it.

IMPROVEMENT,

   I. From what has been brought into view in this chapter, we are led
   farther to reflect on the goodness of God, and our obligation to
   gratitude. The goodness of God appears in his forming angels with such
   high and noble capacities, and under advantages to be proportionably
   happy, in the exercise of their powers, under the good and excellent
   moral government, under which they were placed. God's goodness appears
   in the moral constitution formed for angels, which was, as has been
   observed, more favourable than mere law, as they had the promise of a
   reward of eternal life, inconsequence of their obedience during a
   temporary trial. The infinite goodness and munificence of God is
   expressed in this, and will be forever celebrated by them, who are
   confirmed in holiness, and have actually received this reward. And
   herein is to be seen the goodness of God towards them who fell into sin
   and endless ruin. Their rebellion, and their being treated according to
   their desert, and falling under the threatened punishment, did not
   render the goodness of God to them in their original formation, and in
   placing them under so good a constitution, in any respect or degree the
   less; but was and continues to be as great and perspicuous, as it would
   be if they had continued in this goodness, and had obtained eternal
   life. And were their hearts right, as they ought to be, they would
   never cease to exercise gratitude, and be thankful for the goodness of
   God to them, and to acknowledge that the infinite evil which is come
   upon them, is the just consequence of their abuse of God's goodness to
   them.

   And the goodness of God to man was great and wonderful, in forming him
   with a capacity to be a moral agent, and under moral government, and to
   enjoy endless life in the favour of God. And the constitution and form
   of moral government, which has been considered, was an expression of
   infinite goodness; and could not have been formed by any being, but one
   infinitely good. The law requires nothing but what is necessary for the
   good of man: The highest happiness consisted in obedience to this law.
   The time of trial was to be short; and man was under every desirable
   advantage, and had every conceivable motive to persevere in obedience.
   The reward promised was infinitely great, infinitely more than the
   longest obedience could merit or deserve. And the sanction or penalty
   threatened was necessary in order to its being a good law, and was an
   instance of goodness, as it was a guard to the law, and tended to
   secure obedience, as it rendered disobedience infinitely dreadful, in
   the consequence of it; and so was an unspeakably powerful motive to
   obedience.

   The appointment of a public head, and Adam, to act for the whole, as he
   was, in a sense the whole of mankind, they being all included in him,
   was a wise and good constitution; even the best, and the most in favour
   of mankind of any that can be conceived: Unspeakably more favourable to
   man, than if every one of the human race were to act for himself, and
   be in a state of trial, as they should successively rise into
   existence. There was a possibility that Adam would transgress; it was
   highly probable he would not. And, as has been observed, he had every
   desirable and possible motive to obedience, and a very powerful one
   which could not have existed, had he not acted as a public head, for
   all his posterity.

   All this, as has been observed, was in our favour, and goodness to us.
   This is the happy state in which mankind were placed under moral
   government; the best, the happiest situation which could be devised by
   infinite wisdom and goodness. And it may be demanded. What could have
   been done, that was not done for mankind, in placing them in such
   circumstances, and under such a good law and constitution, consistent
   with being placed in a state of probation?

   The goodness of God ought to be celebrated by us, and to excite our
   constant, fervent gratitude and praise. For, as has been before
   observed, this goodness is not the less, nor are our obligations to
   gratitude and praise in the least diminished by the abuse of it; by
   which we have lost all the benefit of it, and are become most
   miserable.

   II. The sin and eternal ruin of the angels who fell, is suited to give
   conviction to all, of the vanity, weakness and insufficiency of the
   highest and most excellent creatures; and of their absolute and
   constant dependance on God: And consequently, that there is no
   creature, in whom we may safely put any trust, however great and
   dignified.

   This event taught the angels who did not sin this lesson more fully,
   than otherwise they could have learned it. In this they saw their own
   insufficiency for themselves; that they were liable to ruin themselves
   every moment, and depended on God entirely for preservation from
   infinite evil; and that they were wholly indebted to him for this
   favour, which must be sovereign goodness, to which they had no claim,
   and which God was under no obligation to grant. This they will see more
   clearly, and acknowledge with greater sensibility forever, than they
   could have done, if none of them had sinned, and fallen into endless
   ruin: And by it God will be more loved, praised and glorified, and they
   will be unspeakably more holy and happy, throughout their endless
   existence.

   God, in his wisdom, ordered it so, that the highest, and most excellent
   part of the creation, should become morally corrupt, and infinitely
   worse than nothing, by sinking into irrecoverable and endless ruin and
   misery, to shew, that the creature, in its best state, is nothing but
   vanity, considered in itself, independent of the power, goodness and
   all-sufficiency of God; which could not be discovered to creatures, to
   the best advantage, in any other way. Which discovery is of the utmost
   importance, and absolutely necessary to the highest good of the
   universe. This will remain an everlasting lesson, by which all holy
   creatures will be taught humility and gratitude; and God will receive a
   revenue of praise and glory forever, which could not have existed, had
   not this event taken place.

   III. By the view we have had of the divine law and moral government, we
   may learn, what is the rule of our duty now, and consequently, what is
   sin in us, viz. every deviation of heart from the rule of duty, by
   omission of what it requires, or doing what it forbids.

   The particular covenant made with man in his original state; by which
   the head and father of the human race was considered as including all
   mankind, and was constituted to act for the whole, being violated,
   ceased to exist any longer, except in the consequences of the violation
   of it. But the law pointing out and requiring duty, and threatening the
   transgressor, is still the rule of our duty, and binding on us; and in
   the threatening we are told what every transgression of ours deserves;
   and learn what is the curse under which we are, as sinners. For this
   law, as has been shown, is unchangeable in its nature, and must be
   binding on every moral agent. Transgressing it, though ever so often
   repeated, does not in the least absolve us from obligation to obey it;
   and however great is our aversion from what it requires, and however
   strong and fixed it be, this does not in the least excuse us in our
   disobedience, and remove or abate our obligation to obedience; bat the
   stronger and more fixed our hearts are in opposition to what is
   required, and the more and longer such opposition is indulged, the more
   criminal we are. There is no other law given to us, which requires less
   than this original law, or that is not virtually contained in it or
   enforced by it. To love God with all our heart, soul, strength and
   mind, and our neighbour as ourselves, is always our duty; and all
   opposition to it, and every omission of this duty, in the least degree,
   is sin. We must therefore look into this perfect law and rule of duty,
   and no where else, in order to know what is our duty, and what is sin;
   and by this alone can we obtain the knowledge of, and ascertain our own
   moral character.

  ON THE APOSTASY OF MAN, AND THE EVIL CONSEQUENCE TO HIM.

   MAN, who was placed in a happy and honourable situation, did not
   continue in it; but by transgressing the divine command, and violating
   the holy covenant, plunged into a state of infinite guilt and
   wretchedness, under the curse and threatened penalty of the law of God.

   Moses gives a particular history of this first apostasy of man, in the
   third chapter of the book of Genesis. He does not tell us how long man
   continued innocent and obedient, after he was created; or give us a
   history of what passed, and of all the particular events and
   transactions which took place in a state of innocency; such a history
   being of no use and importance to us, while we continue in the present
   state. The whole will doubtless be revealed to all mankind at the day
   of judgment.

   The Serpent is said to be the tempter, by whom Eve was deceived, and
   led to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree; and then gave it to
   Adam, and he eat of it also. It is said, "The serpent was more subtle
   than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made." He appeared
   to have more sagacity than any other of the brute creation. Probably he
   had an erect and very beautiful form, and had nothing of the appearance
   and form of serpents since the fall of man. He appeared near the
   forbidden tree, or on it; perhaps eating of the fruit of it. It seems
   probable that Eve, seeing him there, and eating of the fruit of the
   tree, was surprised; upon which the serpent spoke, "Hath God said, ye
   shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" Eve replied, that God had
   given them full liberty to eat of every tree in the garden, except that
   one; but had forbidden them to touch that, upon the severest penalty.
   The serpent said, "Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know, that in
   the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be
   as gods, knowing good and evil." It is most probable that the serpent
   told the woman that by eating of the fruit of that tree, he had
   obtained the use of reason, and the faculty of speech, which she saw
   him now to exercise; and therefore said, that from his own experience,
   he could assure her, that if she would eat of this fruit, she should be
   so far from dying, that she should arrive to a much higher degree of
   perfection and knowledge. The first motion in her mind disposing her to
   regard and believe the serpent, rather than God, who had said, she
   should surely die, if she eat of that tree, was wrong and sinful: so
   that she really fell from her innocence, before she actually took of
   the fruit, and ate. Her doing the latter was completing her apostasy,
   by a full exertion of her will in open rebellion. And the first motion
   of Adam's heart, which implied the least degree of inclination to
   hearken to the woman, and eat of the forbidden fruit, was a sinful one;
   and he was a rebel in heart, before he actually ate.

   Nothing is spoken of as the tempter but the serpent; because nothing
   else was visible but the serpent speaking and reasoning; or rather
   deceiving and lying. But the story itself, when properly considered,
   will necessarily lead us to conceive of some superior, invisible agent,
   speaking and acting in and by the serpent, making him the instrument,
   by which he effected his design. And as it could not be a good spirit,
   which by the serpent acted this part, it must be an evil one; which is
   confirmed by what God said to the serpent, after the apostasy of man,
   which will be considered more particularly in its place. But this is
   reduced to a certainty in succeeding divine revelation, where the devil
   and his angels are brought into view: And Christ evidently alludes to
   this instance of ruining mankind by deceit and lying when he says, "The
   devil was a murderer from the beginning; and he is a liar, and the
   father of it." And the devil is repeatedly called the dragon, and the
   serpent, "That old serpent called the devil, and satan which deceiveth
   the whole world," plainly alluding to the serpent which in the
   beginning deceived and seduced our first parents. [177] The devil, in
   order to carry on his design, made use of the serpent as his
   instrument, he being a creature best suited to answer his purpose. And
   God saw fit to suffer him to do it.

   By this act of disobedience, our first parents violated the covenant
   which God had made with them, and forfeited all the good promised to
   obedience, and brought upon themselves the penalty threatened. It was
   not, indeed, completely executed upon them immediately. They fell under
   the divine displeasure and wrath, which was sufficiently great to
   destroy them forever; and which, if fully executed on them, must make
   them miserable, without end. They were condemned, and fell into a state
   of complete eternal ruin, being totally and forever undone and lost,
   without any help or hope. Thus they died immediately on sinning: Though
   the full execution of the punishment did not take place immediately;
   yet as they were condemned and cursed, and utterly undone, and had
   nothing in their reach or view to prevent infinite evil coming upon
   them, the evil threatened in a true sense fell upon them, and they died
   in the day on which they transgressed. The sentence of death, and the
   penalty threatened in the law under which the angels were, fell upon
   those who sinned immediately; but it will not be completely executed
   till the day of judgment; nor will it ever be, because it is endless
   punishment, to which they are condemned. It will be in execution
   without end, and so, strictly speaking, will never be fully executed:
   And yet the execution is according to the threatening. So it is in the
   case of man; he fell under the threatening immediately on his sinning,
   though the full and complete execution of it, do not take place for
   many ages.

   St. Paul says, "When the commandment or law came, sin revived, and I
   died:" That is, he found himself dead. He found himself under the curse
   of the law, which was contained in the original threatening, "In the
   day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." If Paul found himself
   dead, agreeable to the threatening of the law, then Adam did really die
   in the same sense, or the same death: and sin, even the first act of
   disobedience, wrought this death in him. The evil which the law
   threatened, "Thou shalt surely die," in this sense, came upon him. He
   fell under the curse. This sentence fell upon him, and he was a dead
   man. Paul calls this death, or dying; and by this tells us what dying
   means in the threatening; and that Adam did die on that day in which he
   ate the forbidden fruit.

   Bat if this were not so, and Adam did not die the death threatened on
   the day he sinned, this may be consistent with the execution of the
   threatening, according to the true intent of it. The threatening, "In
   the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die," expresses two
   things, viz. The certainty of the punishment, as infallibly connected
   with transgression; and that the threatened penalty should follow on
   one or the first act of rebellion. We find much the same language used,
   to express one or both these; and not that the threatening should be
   immediately executed, or on the day in which the crime was committed.
   "The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of
   his transgression. As for the wicked less of the wicked, he shall not
   fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness: Neither
   shall the righteous be able to live in the day that he sinneth; but for
   his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die or it." [178] This
   does not express the time when death should be executed or take place;
   but the certainty of the punishment. "For it shall be that on the day
   that thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shall know
   for certain, that thou shalt surely die." [179] This does not mean,
   that he should die on the same day in which he should pass over Kidron;
   but that he should certainly be put to death for this offence, without
   any farther trial.

   This apostasy of our first parents, was a total apostasy: That is, by
   giving themselves up to this sin, an inclination to sin took the
   dominion in their hearts, and they wholly lost all their moral
   rectitude and holiness, or the moral image of God, in which they were
   created. This is not expressly asserted in the history of their sin;
   but it may be inferred from the nature of the case. By this
   transgression they forfeited all favour from their Maker, and fell
   under his displeasure, and were cursed, according to the law and
   constitution, under which they were when they sinned; and it was
   inconsistent therefore to shew them any favour; especially such a
   favour, as preserving them from total apostasy, or their being
   continued in the exercise of love to God, while they were under that
   constitution, and antecedent to the revelation of the dispensation of
   grace. Moreover, the first act of sin carried in it an inclination to
   universal sinfulness, and opposition to holiness in general, or to all
   and every degree of holiness; and according to the natural course of
   things, would issue in total depravity, in the exclusion of all moral
   good, and the complete possession and reign of moral evil in their
   hearts. This consisted in their ceasing to love God, and loving
   themselves only; which self love, or selfishness, was in every degree
   of it opposed to the law under which they were, and the fruitful source
   of all sin; which will more fully appear, when this subject will come
   more particularly into view, in its proper place. There was nothing
   therefore that could prevent their total apostasy, or becoming wholly
   sinful, and opposed to the law of God, and all holiness, unless God had
   miraculously interposed, contrary to the law and constitution under
   which they sinned, to prevent it, and exercised mere sovereign favour,
   which, as has been observed, would be inconsistent with the
   constitution under which they sinned.

   The above reasoning, to prove that the apostasy of man was total,
   appears to be confirmed by the apostasy of the angels who sinned. It is
   presumed all will grant that their first apostasy was not partial, but
   total. If the angels fell totally in their first rebellion, why not man
   also? It is true that under another and a new dispensation of grace
   through a Mediator, holiness is introduced and maintained in the heart
   of the believer, in a small and low degree, while there is also a
   degree of sinful exercise; and both these, sin and holiness, continue
   through life; and particular acts of sin of which believers are guilty,
   do not bring on total depravity, and wholly extinguish every degree of
   divine love: But this may with propriety be called a miracle, being
   contrary to the course of nature, and the constitution of things, which
   originally took place, and is the effect of the new constitution, by
   which the original order or course of nature is counteracted by the
   introduction of a gracious dispensation; and the nature and natural
   course of sin is interrupted and opposed, by special divine
   interposition: But this is so far from an evidence that our first
   parents could go into an overt act of rebellion, consistent with
   retaining any degree of love to God, that it is a proof of the
   contrary, and that man, by the first apostasy, sunk into total
   depravity, and became wholly a rebel, and altogether opposed to the
   divine law.

   It has been observed, and it is thought proved in the foregoing
   chapter, that all mankind were created and comprehended in the first
   man; as much as were all the trees and plants, in the first trees and
   plants which were made, with the seed in themselves, to produce a
   succession of trees and plants after their kind, to the end of the
   world. Therefore in what God said to Adam, and his transactions with
   him in giving him law, and forming a covenant with him, he was
   considered and treated as comprehending all mankind; and he was the
   real and constituted head of the whole race, so that his obedience or
   transgression should affect all mankind, as it affected him, and was to
   be considered as the obedience or disobedience of all. It is proposed
   now, to attempt to explain this point more fully, and show how far, and
   in what respects, all Adam's posterity are comprehended in the first
   transgression, and affected by it.

   I. By the constitution and covenant with Adam, his first disobedience
   was the disobedience of all mankind. That is, the sin, and consequent
   ruin of all the human race, was by this constitution infallibly
   connected with the first sin of the head and father of the race. By the
   divine constitution, the appointment of God, if the head and father of
   mankind sinned, the whole race of men, all his posterity, should sin;
   and in this sense it should be the sin of the whole. Accordingly, when
   the head became a sinner, and moral corruption took possession of the
   heart, a sure foundation was laid, by the constitution under which man
   was, for the same sin and moral corruption to take place and spread
   through all the human race: Just as by a divine appointment, or a law
   of nature, the $ap of the root or original stock of a tree passes into
   the numerous limbs, twigs and the fruit of the tree, as they
   successively grow out of it. If the sap or nature of the root or stock
   be bad, sour or poisonous, the same is communicated to the whole, and
   every branch, and all the fruit and seed of the whole tree, is corrupt,
   sour, or poisonous, and of all the trees which spring from that, or are
   produced by the seed of it. Thus, if any tree was, when first created,
   of a poisonous nature, and produced such fruit, all that race of trees,
   or all that should spring from it, would of course be of the same
   nature. And if a tree or plant, which was created al first good and
   wholesome, did degenerate, and become corrupt and poisonous, all that
   should proceed from that, would, of course, be equally corrupt.

   The disobedience of Adam decided the character of all his natural
   posterity; and rendered it certain, according to a divine, revealed
   constitution, that they should be born, and rise into existence as
   moral agents, in disobedience and rebellion: And that the same moral
   corruption which then took place in his heart, should spread through
   the whole race of mankind. In this sense, the first sin carried in it
   the sin of all mankind, and contained the seed, and was the foundation
   of all the moral corruption of the human race; as by this they were all
   constituted sinners,

   II. As the first sin was, in the sense just explained, the common sin
   of all mankind, as the disobedience of them all was infallibly
   connected with it, and by it all the human race were constituted or
   made sinners; so as this first sin brought condemnation, or the penalty
   of the law on Adam, it fell equally on all mankind. For as the sin of
   Adam inferred and implied the disobedience of all, the consequent
   condemnation of all was equally implied and involved in the
   condemnation of Adam. Or the condemnation and penalty which fell on
   Adam, the father and head of mankind, really came upon all his
   posterity. As the sin was common to all, so was the curse. And it is
   here particularly to be observed, that as Adam first disobeyed, and
   condemnation and the curse came upon him, for his disobedience and in
   consequence of it; so these take place just in the same order in his
   posterity, their sin, or the moral corruption, which is common to all
   mankind, first takes place, as the ground and reason of their
   condemnation, and liableness to the threatened penalty.

   The evidence that this was the original constitution under which
   mankind were placed has been in some measure given in the foregoing
   chapter. But there is more clear and certain evidence, that things have
   actually taken place in this manner and according to such a
   constitution; and that the sin of all the posterity of Adam, and the
   consequent condemnation and curse, were thus connected with the first
   sin of their common father and head, and come upon all mankind as the
   certain and appointed consequence of the original apostasy of man; the
   former being implied, and involved in the latter. This is now to be
   brought into view, and carefully considered.

   1. The pain, sorrow, and train of evils in this world, which issue in
   the death of the body, to which all mankind are sentenced, and which
   actually came upon them all, in consequence of the original
   transgression, are a standing evidence, and full demonstration, that
   the sin and condemnation of all the posterity of Adam were infallibly
   connected with that first sin, and involved in it.

   Though these evils were denounced to the first parents of mankind on
   their disobedience, and they only are addressed in the sentence; yet it
   is evident from fact, that all their posterity were included in them,
   and fell under the same sentence, and were doomed to the same evils.
   This is not only an evidence that Adam was considered, as including his
   posterity as their common head, so that what was said to him and of
   him, was said to, and of all mankind; but also renders it certain, that
   all his children were considered as sinners, in consequence of the
   apostasy of their first father; and that there was a certain connection
   between the first sin, and the sin and guilt of all mankind. For surely
   it would not be proper or just to sentence all mankind to these evils,
   when considered as perfectly innocent. There is therefore no possible
   way to account for this, consistent with the righteousness and equity
   of the divine government, but by supposing and granting that all the
   posterity of Adam were constituted, and considered to be sinners, in
   consequence of his sinning, or by his first offence, there being a
   certain constituted connection between his first transgression, and the
   sinning of all the human race.

   Separation of soul and body, and the numerous particular natural evils
   which now take place among mankind in this life, could have had no
   existence, if the original threatening had been executed without
   mitigation; or had not the redemption taken place, by which mankind are
   put into a new state of probation, as has been before observed.
   Nevertheless, had not man sinned, these evils which issue in the death
   of the body could not have taken place, as redemption also could not.
   Therefore these evils are introduced, and afflicted on man, in
   consequence of sin, and as a standing testimony of God's displeasure
   with him, and consequently cannot be inflicted on any but sinners. We
   are therefore sure that as the death of the body, with other attendant
   evils, are inflicted on all mankind, they are all considered and
   treated as sinners; and consequently, that they are really sinners; and
   that their being such had a certain connection with the first sin, upon
   which they were condemned to these evils.

   Adam is sentenced to the death of the body, and all the train of
   preceding evils, because he had sinned, and offended his Maker; and
   this is expressly declared to be the ground of the sentence. And as
   this sentence was extended to all his posterity, and they were included
   in it, as much as Adam himself, they were considered and treated by
   this as being sinners, whenever they should exist; which could not be,
   unless there were a certain established connection between the sin of
   the first man, and the sinfulness of all mankind. If it were possible
   that any of Adam's natural posterity should be innocent, this sentence
   could not be extended to them; but they must have been excepted.
   Therefore as all are included in the sentence, not one of mankind can
   possibly be innocent; but the sinfulness and guilt of all are
   infallibly connected with the sin of Adam, and included in it, by an
   established constitution.

   Many particular instances of the death of men, who have been cut off in
   divine providence, are represented to be expressions of God's
   displeasure with them for their sins, such as the drowning of the old
   world; the destruction of the inhabitants of Sodom, &:c. and
   innumerable other instances. How much more must the sentence of death
   upon all mankind, be an expression of God's displeasure with them, for
   their sinfulness and guilt!

   2. That the sin, and the consequent guilt and condemnation of all the
   human race, were by divine constitution connected with Adam's sinning,
   is very particularly and expressly asserted by St. Paul.

   "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
   and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Through the
   offence of one, many died. For the judgment was by one, to
   condemnation. By one man's offence, death reigned by one. By the
   offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation. By one
   man's disobedience, many were made sinners." [180]

   Here sin, condemnation and death, are expressly said to be introduced
   into the world, upon all mankind, by one offence, one act of
   disobedience of one man, that is, Adam. When it is said that sin
   entered into the world by one, the meaning cannot be merely that one
   man sinned first, or that Adam committed the first sin, sinned before
   any of his posterity did sin; for this would be to assert nothing to
   the purpose. But by sin entering into the world, is meant its taking
   place among mankind, and spreading or extending to ail the posterity of
   Adam. Death entered into the world as sin did, as the consequence of
   it, by one man; and this passed or came upon all men, just as sin did.
   This is expressly asserted in the words immediately following, "For
   that all have sinned." By one man sin entered into the world of
   mankind, as the common sin of all, and extended to every one of his
   posterity, and by this sin, death entered also, and came upon all
   mankind, in that by this one offence all became sinners; there being an
   established connection between the sin of this one man, and the sinning
   of all. That this is the truth, and what is asserted in those words, is
   made certain beyond dispute, by the repetition of the same assertion,
   in other and more express words, in the 19th verse. "By one man's
   disobedience, many were made sinners." Here the disobedience of Adam is
   said, in this sense, to be the disobedience of all his posterity, that
   their sinning was connected with his disobedience, or implied and
   involved in it; so that by his sinning, they were all made sinners, or
   constituted sinners, as the Greek word properly signifies. That is, by
   a fixed, divine constitution, if Adam sinned, all his posterity were to
   become sinners; so that by his disobedience, he fixed this character
   upon all mankind.

   Condemnation and death, or judgment to condemnation, came upon all men,
   considered as sinners, or as a consequence of sin, as it came upon
   Adam. It is represented in this light in this passage. Death entered
   into the world by sin, and came upon all men, because, or inasmuch as
   all men were sinners, being made sinners, by the disobedience of Adam
   their head, by virtue of the divine constitution and covenant made with
   him, they all fell under condemnation to death, considered in this
   character, or as sinners. "By one man's offence death reigned." All
   mankind being constituted offenders, or sinners by one offence of Adam,
   death took place, and held dominion and reigned over all. Again he
   says, verse 21, "As sin hath reigned unto death." Death is asserted to
   be the consequence of the reign of sin in the world, or among mankind.

   It has been observed, that by death, which is mentioned six times in
   this passage, is evidently meant eternal destruction, or the second
   death, as it is put in opposition to eternal life, and is the wages of
   sin; unless death mentioned in the 14th verse, be an exception. But if
   it be, and it were granted that the death of the body is intended
   whenever death is mentioned in this paragraph; yet this would not evade
   or weaken the evidence and proof it contains, that the posterity of
   Adam are constituted sinners by his first sin, so as by it to fall
   under condemnation, and become justly exposed to the second death. For
   if a moral agent be in such a sense a sinner, as to deserve any evil,
   he must deserve infinite evil, that is, endless punishment; for this,
   as has been proved, is the just wages of sin, and what every sin
   deserves. Therefore if any evil, even that of the death of the body, be
   inflicted on mankind, in consequence of Adam's first act of
   disobedience, it carries in it a certain evidence, that they become
   sinners by that sin of his, there being an established connection
   between his sin and their being sinners, and that they deserve all the
   evil which the first sin deserved, and was threatened to the first act
   of disobedience, which was endless misery, the just wages of sin. In
   this view, the death of the body, to which all mankind are subjected,
   is a standing evidence that they are sinners, and consequently that
   they deserve endless punishment: For if they were not sinners, they
   could not be sentenced to this evil; and if they are sinners, and
   deserve this evil, they deserve infinite evil, which is the just desert
   of every sin. And as this death comes on all mankind in consequence of
   one act of disobedience of the first man, the head and father of all,
   it is a certain evidence that by his sin, all his posterity are
   constituted and become sinners, and were considered as such, as soon as
   Adam sinned; otherwise his sin could not have brought this death upon
   all mankind, or upon any but the first sinner. And their being
   condemned to this death, necessarily implied their personal sin in
   consequence of Adam's sinning, and just desert of the second death, as
   has been shown.

   Hence it appears, that as long as this passage of scripture is to be
   found in the Bible, we have good evidence that the sin and ruin of all
   mankind was implied, and certainly involved in the first act of
   disobedience of Adam.

   3. This is also demonstrably certain, in that the posterity of Adam are
   all considered and treated as sinners, and deserving and exposed to
   endless ruin, in the method which has been opened and prosecuted for
   the recovery and salvation of man, by Jesus Christ. In the revelation
   of this salvation, and all that has been done to effect it, it is
   supposed that all mankind are lost in sin; that every one of the
   natural posterity of Adam who has been born, has been a sinner; and
   that every one that shall be born and exist to the end of the world,
   will exist a sinner, and in a state of condemnation and ruin. The
   gospel is represented as providing relief for all who believe, and the
   only way in which mankind can be saved, all being condemned and
   infallibly lost forever, who are not saved by Christ. There could be no
   reason for this, unless it were certain that all mankind would rise
   into existence sinners, and so be involved in condemnation and ruin,
   and stand in absolute need of the revealed Saviour. But this could not
   be, unless this was implied in the apostasy of the father of mankind,
   and upon this was fixed and made certain. [181] How could a Saviour
   from sin and destruction be provided and revealed for mankind,
   immediately upon the sin of Adam, if this sin did not involve the sin
   and ruin of all? for the innocent could have no need of such a Saviour.
   And with what propriety could the gospel be ordered to be preached to
   all nations, and to every one of the human race to the end of the
   world, if it were not certain that every one was in a state of sin and
   ruin? This can be well accounted for, if the sin and ruin of Adam's
   posterity were connected with his first sin, and involved in it, by
   virtue of the covenant and constitution made with the father of
   mankind; and the whole is consistent and easy to be understood: But no
   consistent, rational, satisfactory account can be given of this, on any
   other supposition.

   4. Agreeable to this, mankind are represented in the scripture, to be
   universally depraved and morally corrupt; and this appears to be true
   from fact and experience. It is needless to adduce all the passages of
   scripture in which this is asserted. St. Paul asserts this in such
   express and strong terms, when he is attending particularly to this
   point, that it will be established sufficiently for the present
   purpose, by appealing to his words. [182] "We have before proved both
   Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin: As it is written, There
   is none righteous, no, not one. They are all gone out of the way, they
   are together become unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no,
   not one,--That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
   guilty before God." This witness is supported, and appears to be true
   from the character mankind have given of themselves, by their general
   conduct in all ages, as there never has appeared to be one perfectly
   upright, sinless person; and in general all nations and generations, of
   every age, have been exceeding corrupt and sinful; and that while many
   of them have had great light and advantage to be wise and virtuous, and
   when great and special means have been used with them in the best
   manner suited to make them so. By a great variety of experiments which
   have been made, it appears that mankind are so sunk into sin, and
   strongly inclined to evil, that no external applications, means,
   motives, and advantages are sufficient to reclaim them. And children,
   as soon as they are capable of manifesting any moral disposition or
   inclination, universally discover that which is contrary to the law of
   God.

   If what the scripture asserts on this head, wanted any support from
   fact, this character which mankind have themselves drawn by their
   practice would be a sufficient one.

   When St. Paul had asserted and proved in the words just quoted, that
   all mankind are become wholly corrupt and sinful, that "all have
   sinned, and come short of the glory of God," he proceeds to account for
   this, and show the ground and origin of the universal sinfulness of the
   posterity of Adam, in the paragraph which has been considered. "By one
   man sin entered into the world, and death by sin: and so death passed
   upon all men, for that all have sinned. By one man's disobedience, many
   were made sinners." [183] And there is the greatest reason to believe,
   and rest satisfied in this account, not only as it is given by divine
   inspiration, but as it is the only rational, consistent and
   satisfactory account of this interesting affair, that can be given.

   That such a constitution is just and wise, and that mankind have no
   reason to object to it as injurious to them, is evident from what has
   been observed upon it in the foregoing chapter. [184] But that this may
   appear yet more evident, and all objections be obviated, a particular
   explanation of this matter, and vindication of the divine conduct
   herein, will be now attempted.

   It is carefully to be observed, that sin does not take place in the
   posterity of Adam, in consequence of his sin, or that they are not
   constituted sinners by his disobedience, as a punishment, of the
   penalty of the law coming upon them for his sin: It is not to be
   supposed that the offence of Adam is imputed to them to their
   condemnation, while they are considered as in themselves, in their own
   persons innocent: Or that they are guilty of the sin of their first
   father, antecedent to their own sinfulness. But all that is asserted,
   as what the scripture teaches on this head is, that by a divine
   constitution, there is a certain connection between the first sin of
   Adam, and the sinfulness of his posterity; so that as he sinned and
   fell under condemnation, they in consequence of this became sinful and
   condemned. Therefore when Adam had sinned, by this the character and
   state of all his posterity were fixed, and they were by virtue of the
   covenant made with Adam, constituted or made sinners like him; and
   therefore were considered as such, before they had actual existence. It
   was made certain, and known and declared to be so, that all mankind
   should sin as Adam had done, and fully consent to his transgression,
   and join in the rebellion which he began; and, by this, bring upon
   themselves the guilt of their father's sin, by consenting to it,
   joining with him in it, and making it their own sin.

   This cannot be objected to as an unjust appointment, or a constitution
   injurious to mankind, without equally objecting to God's willing and
   ordering things so as to make it certain that any of his creatures
   should sin. If it was his will that Adam should sin, and he constituted
   and ordered things so that it was certain that he would sin, and he had
   a right to do this; then it was right and just to will and determine
   that all the posterity of Adam should sin, and to form a constitution,
   which established a certain connection of the latter with the former.
   The disobedience of Adam was connected with something which preceded
   it, and of which it was the consequence; and it was determined and
   fixed by God, as has been proved, and which all must grant who hold
   that God did permit Adam to sin: But none will say or think that this
   was a punishment inflicted on Adam, thus to determine, and form and fix
   a constitution which made his sinning certain; or that this was
   injurious to Adam, or in the least degree improper or unwise. And if
   this was just and wise and good, then it was equally so, to form a
   constitution which connected the sin of all mankind with the first sin
   of the father of the human race. Or, if he might and did permit Adam to
   sin, consistent with justice, wisdom and goodness, he might, consistent
   with all these, permit everyone of his posterity to sin, and therefore
   determine to do it. And if God had a right to order things so that all
   mankind should sin, independent of their connection with Adam and his
   sin, and this be no more unjust or injurious to them, than to order
   things so that Adam and myriads of angels should sin; then certainly no
   wrong is done to them, by ordering that this should depend upon, and
   take place in consequence of this sin of Adam. No objection can be made
   to this, which ib not equally an objection to God's ordering things so
   that sin should take place, and has taken place in any instance, among
   angels or men.

   The following propositions must be granted, as axioms of indubitable
   truth, and may serve to give light to the point under consideration.

   1. Every creature capable of moral agency and holiness is entirely
   dependent on God, not only for his continuance in existence, but for
   all his moral exercises; and especially for his moral excellence or
   holiness. This is a greater and higher gift than mere existence, and
   when it is given, the continuance of it is entirely dependent on the
   will of God. The most excellent creature in the exercise of perfect
   holiness, is, in his own nature changeable, and may become sinful; and
   nothing can secure him from this but the will and agency of the
   infinite, unchangeable Being.

   2. God is under no obligation to preserve the moral agents which he
   creates, from sinning. If this proposition were not self-evident, the
   actual existence of sin is a demonstration of the truth of it.

   3. God may, therefore, for wise reasons, will and determine not to
   prevent the sin and consequent ruin of his creatures; which is really
   willing that sin should take place. The truth of this proposition is
   also demonstrated by the sin which has actually taken place; for this
   could not have been, unless God, all things considered, willed it
   should be, otherwise it must have taken place contrary to his will, or
   while he was not willing it should exist, which is infinitely
   impossible.

   4. If God may, and has actually exercised his will and choice about the
   existence of sin, and determined in favour of its actually taking
   place, and this be consistent with his wisdom, holiness and goodness,
   as it certainly is; then it is consistent with his glorious moral
   character, to dispose, order and do every thing which is necessary to
   be, ordered and done independent of the creature, and previous to their
   actually sinning, in order to the certain existence of this event. This
   has been observed in a former chapter; where it has been also shown
   that the former, viz. that God's willing the existence of sin, does
   necessarily imply the latter: and that these are not really two
   distinct things; but one and the same. [185]

   From all this, it appears, that God, being under no obligation to
   preserve any of his rational creatures from sinning, may, consistent
   with his righteousness, wisdom and holiness, order things so that any
   number of them shall become sinful, when this is most for his glory and
   the general good. Accordingly, it was agreeable to his will and purpose
   that vast numbers of the angels should fall into sin: And had this will
   and purpose reached all of them, they would have had no reason to
   complain of any injustice or wrong done to them. And therefore those
   who have not sinned, must ascribe it to the sovereign, distinguishing,
   undeserved favour of God, that they have been preserved innocent and
   holy, when so great a number of them went off into a state of
   rebellion. And he had a right to order it so that any number, or all of
   mankind, should become sinners, as they rose into existence, had there
   been no constitution connecting their sinning with the sin of Adam; and
   no injustice or injury would have been done to any. And since God has
   seen fit to order and constitute things so that the universal
   sinfulness of man should take place, in connection with the sin of
   Adam, and as the unfailing consequence of it, which he might have
   ordered without doing them any wrong, had not Adam first sinned, or
   without any consideration of his sin, or connection with it, surely
   there is no ground or colour of an objection to it, as being injurious
   to them. If mankind had no claim to be exempted from sin, had there
   been no connection between them and Adam, or had they no common head or
   father; then surely they have no reason to complain, that they are
   become sinners by a constitution, appointing Adam to be their public
   head, and connecting their becoming sinners with his sinning.

   It is a notorious and acknowledged fact, that all mankind are sinners;
   sinning is infallibly connected with their existence. There is
   certainly some unfailing constitution or law, which constantly and
   effectually operates to produce this effect in all Adam's posterity. We
   are sure this is just, and no wrong is done to man, that sin does thus
   infallibly take place in all, by some steady, efficacious cause, though
   we were not able to tell by what means, or in what way this universal
   corruption of man has been introduced, and taken place. And shall we
   complain as being injured by this, because God has seen fit to favour
   us with a revelation, informing us how, and in what way this universal
   sinfulness of the human race has been introduced and taken place; "That
   by one man sin entered into the world: And by one man's disobedience,
   many (even all his posterity) are made sinners?"

   And to complain of this, is not only to find fault with that which is
   just, by which no wrong is done to us; but to object to a most wise and
   good constitution. This constitution is perfectly agreeable to the
   natural relation in which Adam's posterity stood to their common head
   and parent; and all mankind were so comprehended and included in the
   first man, that it was natural, proper and wise to deal with him as
   including all his posterity, and to constitute him to act for them all,
   as being in him. And there farther appears a natural propriety and
   fitness in such a constitution, if we consider the nature and tendency
   of sin, and the inclination, wish and attempt of the sinner who rebels
   against God. Adam's first rebellion contained in it a desire and wish
   that all his posterity might sin as he did. This became agreeable to
   his heart as soon as sin entered into it; and so far as he had power
   and influence, it would certainly take place. To suppose the contrary,
   is inconsistent and absurd. The corruption and rebellion of all Adam's
   children therefore must be the consequence of his sinning, unless his
   inclination, desire and attempt were crossed and counteracted. And his
   sin had a mighty and almost irresistible tendency to lead all his
   posterity into the same rebellion; and who can say this would not be
   the consequence, without one exception, had things taken their natural
   course, without being opposed and prevented by divine interposition?
   Adam's sin had a natural tendency to corrupt the world of mankind, and
   according to the natural course of things would spread to every
   individual of his posterity. And this was agreeable to the inclination
   and choice of the father of mankind. The language of his transgression
   was, "Let all my posterity sin as I do, and be as I am; let them rise
   into existence in my own image and likeness: So far as I have power to
   beget and produce them, they shall be rebels like myself."--Therefore,
   according to the natural course of things, and the nature and tendency
   of sin, and agreeable to the inclination and choice of Adam, the first
   act of sin by the common father and head of mankind, contained in it
   the infection and sin of all the human race; and must corrupt the
   whole, and issue in the rebellion and ruin of every one, unless
   counteracted and prevented by divine interposition. Hence it appears
   that the divine constitution connecting the sin and ruin of all mankind
   with the first sin of their common father, is so far from being
   arbitrary and unnatural, that it is an establishment, agreeable to the
   natural course, tendency and connection of things, and perfectly
   consonant to the nature of sin, and serves to make a display of this.
   And that a contrary constitution, which should prevent the spreading of
   the sin of Adam to his posterity, or corrupting any one of them, would
   be unnatural and improper, as it would counteract and prevent the
   natural tendency, and the nature, course and connection of things; and
   therefore would not have been wise and good--while the constitution
   which has taken place is agreeable to the nature of things, and both
   wise and good. It appears most wise and best that if any of mankind
   sinned, all should be sinners, and constituted so by the first sin, as
   this has laid a proper and ample foundation for the glorious work of
   redemption, for the character and works of the Redeemer, of whom Adam
   in this way was made a type,--the Redeemer and his works, and the
   consequent glory, being the grand design and end of all. But this will
   rise more clearly into view as we proceed.

   It must be farther observed, that there is no reasonable objection to
   this constitution, in that it not only establishes a connection between
   the sin of Adam and the sinning of his posterity; but that the latter
   should be born in sin, so as to begin to sin, as soon as they begin to
   act as moral agents. For if a moral agent may begin to sin at any time,
   he may begin to sin as soon as he begins to exist with a capacity of
   sinning. And if God is not obliged to prevent his sinning at any time
   of his existence, he is under no obligation to prevent it the first
   moment of his existence. Therefore he had a right to determine the
   sinfulness of all Adam's posterity as soon as they should exist, as a
   certain consequence of his disobedience: And there is no more ground of
   objection to this, than there is to Adam's posterity sinning at any
   time of their existence, in consequence of his sinning.

   If a person can have no reason to complain of any one but himself, if
   he be inclined to sin, and actually disobeys the divine command, at any
   time, at whatever distance from his beginning to exist, he will be
   equally without reason to complain that he is injured by any one, but
   by himself, if he be inclined to sin as soon as he begins to exist, and
   though he never were otherwise inclined. If any one should say, if he
   had not sinned early, even from his beginning to act, he should not
   have sinned now; or if he had not been always inclined to sin from his
   first existence, he should not have been inclined to sin since, with a
   view to exculpate himself, would this be any excuse? Was not his first
   inclination to sin, his own inclination, and as really blameable as if
   it had not been the first, or so soon? And because he began to sin so
   soon, does this excuse his sinning afterwards, and continuing to sin?--

   It seems proper, if not necessary, that if moral corruption be derived
   from Adam to his children, by a fixed law or constitution, it should
   take place from the beginning of their existence. If by their being his
   children, they become corrupt, they must of consequence be corrupt as
   soon as they exist, or become his children. If it were not so, it would
   not appear from fact, that they became sinful by being the posterity of
   Adam, or that their moral corruption was, by divine constitution,
   connected with his sin, by their being his children.

   Agreeable to this, the scripture represents all mankind as sinful from
   the beginning of their existence. "The imagination of man's heart is
   evil from his youth." [186] That is, his infancy, from the beginning of
   his existence. "David says of himself, "Behold, I was shapen in
   iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me." [187] This must be as
   true of all mankind, as of David. "The wicked are estranged from the
   womb, they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." [188]
   Here it is asserted at least, that as soon as they begin to act, they
   sin. And though it cannot be precisely determined how soon this is; yet
   it hence appears that they are by nature corrupt, and they begin to
   exist with that moral corruption, which is the same thing that appears
   as soon as there is opportunity, in visible action, in opposition to
   the rule of truth and duty, the divine law. The words immediately
   following these are "Their poison is like the poison of a serpent." The
   serpent is generated a poisonous creature. Poison is in his nature from
   the beginning of his existence, and when he begins to bite that is
   acted out, with which he was born. There appears to be evident
   reference to this, in these words. The wicked are said to be estranged
   from the womb; to go astray, speaking lies, as soon as they be born:
   And in this respect their poison, their wickedness, is like the poison
   of a serpent. Solomon says, "Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a
   child." By folly and foolishness in his writings, he generally means
   sin, or moral corruption: And certainly this is meant here, because he
   says, "The rod of correction will drive it far from him." The rod of
   correction can drive no other foolishness away, but that which is of a
   moral kind. The expression is very strong and emphatical, and asserts
   that sin has gotten fast hold, and is firmly fixed in the heart of a
   young child, and that this is true of every child which is born. How
   could the early, native corruption of children be more fully
   expressed?--The same is asserted by Christ, when he says to Nicodemus,
   "That which is born of the flesh, is flesh." [189] It is abundantly
   evident from the whole passage in which these words are found, that by
   flesh here is meant moral corruption, or sin, in which sense this word
   is frequently used in the scriptures, especially in the writings of St.
   Paul. According to this, man is born in a state of moral corruption.

   A child, an infant, as soon as he exists, may have moral corruption or
   sin. As soon as he has any mental motion, which is of the nature of
   inclination, this motion, disposition or inclination, may be wrong, and
   have in it the foundation and seeds of every sin, being of the same
   nature with the sinful motions and inclinations of the hearts of adult
   persons. These motions, though invisible and unperceived by us, do
   really, and in the sight of the Omniscient Being, fix the actual moral
   character of the child, which discovers itself to men, as it has
   opportunity, and there is capacity to express it in actions and words.
   This is confirmed by observation and experience. Children commonly,
   before they can speak, discover that selfishness, that wilfulness and
   obstinacy, which is the root and source of all the sin which takes
   place among mankind. This, therefore, is of the same nature with moral
   evil in general, and was in the heart or mind when it first existed;
   and has grown up to a greater degree of strength, as the mind has been
   enlarged, and appears and is acted out, as the capacity increases, and
   opportunity and occasion are offered.

   This sin, which lakes place in the posterity of Adam, is not properly
   distinguished into original and actual sin, because it is all really
   actual, and there is, strictly speaking, no other sin but actual sin.
   [190] As soon as sin exists in a child of Adam, though an infant, it
   consists in motion, or inclination, of the same nature and kind with
   sin in adult persons; all the difference is, the former is not so
   strong, and has not opportunity to be acted out, as the latter is. Sin,
   or an evil inclination, took place and existed in the heart of Adam,
   before he determined to eat, and did eat of the fruit which was
   forbidden. The very first motion in his heart, tending that way, was a
   sinful motion, though it was not perfected or completed till it
   produced the overt act. Who can say that this motion or inclination,
   which may be called lust, was stronger or had more activity in it, than
   the evil motion which may exist in the heart of an infant; which may be
   sufficient to produce the most horrid mental and external acts of sin,
   when capacity and opportunity are given? St. James says, "Every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when
   lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin." He does not mean that lust
   is not sin; for this is contrary to all reason, and cannot be true. And
   if we should suppose this to be asserted or implied, we should make
   this apostle contradict St. Paul, who says, "I had not known sin but by
   the law: For I had not known lust, except the law had said. Thou shalt
   not covet." Here he speaks of lust and sin, as synonymous, by which he
   means one and the same thing. St. James, when he distinguishes lust
   from sin, intends by the latter, what is called, an overt act of sin,
   or sin when it is finished or completed in overt acts, agreeable to the
   following expression. "Sin, when it is finished." It is begun in the
   first and least motion of lust, or evil inclination and motion in the
   heart, and finished by being acted out in an overt act of the will.
   Both are actual sin, yet there is a distinction which maybe made.

   The existence of sin in the heart of a child, as soon as it is capable
   of any thing of a moral nature, can be as well accounted for, and as
   easily, as the sin of an adult person, or as the first existence of sin
   in the heart of Adam. The former being as consistent with the divine
   perfections, and the nature of man, as the latter. What has been said
   in the fourth chapter on the origin and cause of moral evil, may serve
   to illustrate this. And it takes place in the hearts of all the
   posterity of Adam, by virtue of the divine constitution, which has been
   considered and explained above.

   On the whole, it is presumed that none but those who assert that the
   sin of man does take place, contrary to the will and purpose of God,
   and that it is not, all things considered, agreeable to his will that
   it should exist, can have any objection to the doctrine of original
   sin, as it has been stated above, which asserts the universal
   sinfulness of Adam's posterity, to be connected with his first sin by a
   just, wise and good constitution, made by God, when he created man. And
   of these, it is hoped, there are but few, since they must, by such
   assertion, contradict the truth plainly delivered in the holy
   scriptures, and deny the supremacy and absolute independence and
   infinite felicity of the Most High God; as has been observed in the
   forementioned chapter.

   In order to set this important scripture doctrine in a yet more full
   and clear light, the following things must be observed.

   I. Mankind are born totally corrupt or sinful, in consequence of the
   apostasy of Adam. That is, they have naturally, as the children of
   Adam, no degree or kind of moral rectitude, and their hearts are full
   of moral evil. That the first apostasy was total, and that man became
   immediately wholly sinful, having no degree of moral rectitude, has
   been shewn to be, at least, probable, if not certain; and therefore
   when he begat a son in his own likeness, he must come into existence
   wholly sinful. But that this is in fact true of all mankind, is
   expressly and repeatedly asserted in divine revelation. It was early
   declared that "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
   earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
   evil continually." [191] The total corruption and depravity of mankind
   cannot be asserted in stronger and more decisive language than this.
   With reference to this assertion, it is said, "The imagination of man's
   heart is evil from his youth." [192] Agreeable to this, Solomon says,
   "The heart of the sons of men (that is, of all mankind) is full of
   evil. [193] If it be full of evil, there can be no good in it. Again,
   it is said, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
   wicked." [194] St. Paul asserts the total depravity of man, and that
   there is nothing in him naturally which is morally good and right, in
   very express and strong terms, repeated over and over again. He quotes
   the following words from the Old Testament, and expressly applies them
   to all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles. "There is none righteous, no,
   not one. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
   after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
   unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no, not one. There is no
   fear of God before their eyes." [195] This truth is implicitly asserted
   in many passages of scripture. Only a few will be mentioned, since it
   is so clearly asserted in what has been quoted. When Christ says, "That
   which is born of the flesh, is flesh," that is, nothing but flesh, he
   really asserts that man, as he is born, in his natural state, is
   destitute of all moral goodness: For by flesh is meant that which is
   opposed to the holy Spirit, or holiness; and is put for moral
   corruption; which is abundantly evident by the writings of St. Paul.
   Christ says, "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out." All
   under the gospel are invited to come. "Whosoever will, let him come."
   Yet Christ says, "No man can come unto me, except the Father, which
   sent me, draw him." All this put together proves that all mankind are
   wholly opposed to the character of Christ, which they could not be, if
   they had the least degree of moral rectitude, or inclination to that
   which is right. Oar Lord further says, "Whosoever shall give you a cup
   of water to drink, in my name, because you belong to Christ, verily I
   say unto you, he shall not lose his reward." [196] If he who exercises
   so much regard to Christ, as to give a cup of water for his sake, to
   one of his disciples, shall be saved; then men have not by nature the
   least inclination to embrace him, but must be his enemies, which indeed
   is abundantly declared, both by Christ and his apostles. "He that is
   not with me, is against me. Ye shall be hated of all men, for my name's
   sake. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
   you." By the world, is meant mankind in general. To hate Christ implies
   a mind not only destitute of all right disposition; but under the
   dominion of a strong evil propensity. St. Paul says, "The carnal mind
   is enmity against God. In me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
   thing." The carnal mind and the flesh are the same, and stand opposed
   to the mind renewed by the Spirit of God in regeneration. It is said,
   "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: For
   they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they
   are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual, judgeth all
   things." As the natural man is opposed to the spiritual man, that is, a
   true christian, it must mean man in his natural state in which he is
   born, or the world of mankind; which is confirmed by our Saviour's
   saying the same which is here said of the natural man of mankind, as
   distinguished from his disciples. "I will pray the Father, and he shall
   give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even
   the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth
   him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with
   you." [197] This represents man as not having the least degree of true
   taste and discerning of mind with respect to things of a moral,
   spiritual nature, which is the same with being destitute of all moral
   rectitude, or holiness. Nothing but total depravity .can render men
   wholly blind to spiritual things, and so as to be opposed to them, and
   refuse to receive them. This is confirmed by what Christ says, "Except
   a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." [198] He has no
   true discerning and understanding respecting it; but is wholly in the
   dark. Nothing but viciousness or depravity of mind can thus blind them;
   and a being destitute of every degree of conformity to the law of God,
   This is asserted by St. John, "Every one that loveth, is born of God,
   and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God." [199] "Love is
   the fulfilling of the law," which requires nothing but love. It is
   necessary to have this love, in order to see and know God. And
   consequently this is necessary in order to see the Spirit of God; for
   he is God; and in order to know the things of the Spirit of God, and
   see the kingdom of God. And he who has this love does know God, and
   receives the things of the Spirit. But all who are not born of God and
   saved by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost,
   are wholly without every degree of this kind of love; for every one
   that loveth, is born of God. Therefore all who are not born of God are
   wholly without every degree of conformity to the law of God, or of real
   holiness; consequently, are wholly depraved or sinful.

   This fact, the total depravity of mankind, is confirmed by experience
   and observation. Mankind have given this character of themselves, in
   all ages of the world, not only that they are sinners; but that there
   is none that doeth good, no, not one, unless he be renewed by divine
   grace, and is made a new creature, by being created in Christ Jesus,
   unto good works. [200]

   II. It is of importance to observe, That the total moral depravity and
   sinfulness of mankind, which by divine constitution takes place in
   consequence of the sin of their common father, is as much their own
   sin, and they are consequently as answerable and blameable for it, as
   if this their sinfulness had taken place in any other or different way
   that is conceivable or possible.

   Indeed, it is a plain contradiction to say, or suppose, that any
   person's moral depravity or sin is not his own sill, and that all the
   blame and ill desert of it does not lie upon him; for if it be not his
   sin, and he is not answerable for it, it is not sin or moral depravity,
   but must be of a different and contrary nature, and consistent with
   innocence and moral perfection; and consequently cannot subject the
   person to any blame or desert of evil.

   Therefore to talk, or think, of the total or partial moral depravity of
   mankind, as not being wholly their own depravity or sin, and they not
   wholly accountable for it, and as if they are not odious and ill
   deserving in proportion to the degree of their moral corruption or
   sinfulness, is most absurd, and tends only to blind and delude.

   If the natural capacity and powers of mankind were debased and sunk,
   and become much less, and more feeble, independent of any moral
   depravity or sinfulness of theirs, this would not be their sin; nor
   could they be answerable or blamed for it. And if, in consequence of
   their being the children of Adam, and of his sin, they had lost their
   rational powers, and all natural capacity, necessary to constitute them
   moral agents; this could not render them sinful or blameable in the
   least degree; and, by the supposition, they would be utterly incapable
   of either. The constituted consequence and effect of the sin of Adam,
   as it respects his posterity, is their total moral depravity or
   sinfulness; and not the removal or debasing their natural powers of
   mind in the least degree, any farther than the corruption and
   sinfulness of their hearts has influence to prevent the proper use of
   their understanding, and natural powers of mind with which they are
   endowed; and they are by this moral depravity, perverted and improved
   to the purpose of sin and rebellion against God. Therefore nothing is
   necessary in order to restore man to the perfect possession of his
   natural powers, and the proper exercise and use of them, but the
   removal of the moral corruption of his heart, and restoration to the
   perfect exercise of holiness: Which moral corruption is in every
   instance and degree of it, wholly his own corruption and sin, in whose
   heart it takes place, and he is blameable and answerable for it all, be
   it more or less; and it is impossible it should be otherwise, as has
   been observed and proved. But as this matter is liable to be
   misunderstood, and many difficulties respecting it have much
   embarrassed the minds of not a few, it is proper to give it a more
   particular attention.

   1. The sinfulness of mankind being connected with the sin of Adam, as
   the constituted consequence of it, does not in any respect, or in the
   least degree, make it less their own sin, or render them the less
   answerable and blameworthy for it.

   The previous certainty that they will all sin, however, and in whatever
   way this becomes certain, whether by the divine decree, or
   constitution, or whatever, cannot render it less their own sin, or them
   less guilty, than if there were no certainty that they would sin
   antecedent to their actually sinning. This has been considered and
   proved in a former chapter, and cannot be consistently denied by any
   who admit the foreknowledge of God, and believe in divine revelation.
   If the previous certainty that men will act wrong, and sin, renders
   their conduct not wrong and sinful, which is indeed a contradiction;
   then, according to the Bible, neither Pharaoh, nor the Israelites, nor
   Judas, nor the Jews in crucifying Christ, were guilty of any sin; and
   others innumerable, whose actions were predicted in holy writ. Yea,
   according to this, there is, there can be, no sin in the universe,
   since all the actions of creatures were foreknown and therefore certain
   from eternity. It was certain that Adam would sin before he was a
   sinner. This did not render his transgression, no sin, or not his own
   sin, or in the least exculpate him for what he did: So far from this,
   that it necessarily implied, that he would be a sinner, and that he
   should be wholly answerable for that which was his own sin. And if the
   sinfulness of all the posterity of Adam w as certainly connected with
   his sinning, this does not make them sinners, before they actually are
   sinners; and when they actually become sinners, they themselves are the
   sinners, it is their own sin, and they are as blameable and guilty as
   if Adam had never sinned, and each one were the first sinner that ever
   existed. The children of Adam are not answerable for his sin, and it is
   not their sin any farther than they approve of it, by sinning as he
   did: In this way only they become guilty of his sin, viz. by approving
   of what he did, and joining with him in rebellion. And it being
   previously certain by divine constitution, that all mankind would thus
   sin, and join with their common head in rebellion, renders it no less
   their own sin and crime, than if this certainty had taken place on any
   other ground, or in any other way; or than if there had been no
   certainty that they would thus all sin, were this possible.

   2. The moral corruption or sin of mankind, is not the less their own
   sin and crime, because they begin to sin so early, and are morally
   depraved as soon as they exist, capable of any thing of a moral nature.
   It is evident from scripture and from fact, as has been shown, that
   this is true of all the children of Adam. They are sinful as soon as
   they are capable subjects of any thing of a moral kind, and their first
   moral exercises are wrong and sinful: But nevertheless, it is their own
   depravity, and all their moral exercises are as much their own, and
   this corruption and these exercises are as really criminal, as they
   could be, did they not take place so soon; but in any supposeable
   aftertime. The time in which a person begins to have moral exercises,
   right or wrong, whether earlier or later, does not alter the nature of
   those exercises. If his exercises be wrong and selfish, from the
   beginning of his existence, they are in their own nature as really
   wrong and sinful, as if he had been holy a thousand years, and after
   that had fallen into a course of the same wrong and sinful exercises
   and conduct. It is not necessary, in order to a creature's being
   sinful, that he should first be virtuous, or free from moral
   corruption. The first sin of Adam would have been as really his own
   sin, and his own crime, had he sinned sooner than he did; yea, if that
   had been the first act of his, and he had never had one virtuous
   exercise: His previous holy exercises might be the means of rendering
   his sin which he afterwards committed, more criminal than otherwise it
   would have been; but had there been no such holy exercises previous to
   his sin, and his first exercises had been contrary to holiness, they
   would have been as much his own exercises, and as really criminal, as
   was his first sin, which he committed after he had been holy for a
   time. The plain, incontestible reason has been given for this, viz.
   That all sin consists in the nature and quality of the exercises which
   take place in a moral agent, and not in any thing which goes before, or
   follows after them, and which is not of the same kind.

   If a person finds himself now a sinner, and that from the heart he
   approves of, and chooses rebellion against God and his laws, he is not
   the less a sinner, because he has been of the same disposition many
   years, and has always sinned, since he has been conscious of any of his
   own exercises; yea, has in fact had the same disposition, from the
   beginning of his existence. His having sinned before, and done nothing
   else but sin, since he began to act, is no excuse for his sinning now,
   and going on to sin, nor does it make his present sinful exercises less
   his own sin, nor any of the precedent ones, than if he never had such
   exercises more than at one time of his life. Yea, according to the
   common sense of mankind, he is the more criminal, and his character is
   the worse and more odious, for his being always given to wickedness,
   and to do evil, from a child; so that it is natural, or in his very
   nature, to do evil. It has been often said of persons, in order to
   represent them very criminal, and set their character in a bad and
   odious light, "Their conduct has been always bad and mischievous, their
   character has been bad from children, they sprang from very wicked
   families; they are vicious by nature; and mischievousness runs in their
   very blood, &c."

   King David represents himself in this light, and speaks of his native
   corruption as his own, and as an aggravation of all his sins, and the
   odiousness of his own character, in that remarkable penitential psalm
   of his, [201] "Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my
   mother conceive me."

   It is not necessary to determine when or how soon the children of Adam
   became moral agents, or what is necessary to constitute them such, in
   order to decide the point now under consideration; since it is only
   asserted that the moral corruption of mankind, is not the less their
   own sin and fault, because it takes place as soon as they are capable
   of moral exercise, be that when it may. Many have supposed that none of
   mankind are capable of sin or moral agency, before they can distinguish
   between right and wrong, and know what the law of God requires, and
   what it forbids: But this wants proof, which never has been yet
   produced. And it appears to be contrary to Divine Revelation: For that
   speaks of sins committed ignorantly, and supposes a person may sin and
   be guilty in those exercises, and that conduct, in which he has no
   knowledge or consciousness that he is doing wrong. Hence it appears,
   that persons may be moral agents, and sin without knowing what the law
   of God is, or of what nature their exercises are; and while they have
   no consciousness that they are wrong. And if so, then as soon as
   children are capable of the least motion and exercise of the heart,
   which is contrary to the law of God, such motions and exercises are sin
   in them, and their sin, though they are ignorant of it: And of such
   sinful inclinations and exercises, they may be capable as soon as they
   exist the children of Adam. It is certain no one can know it not to be
   so: And this is agreeable to the representation the scripture gives of
   the matter, which puts it beyond all doubt. This has been particularly
   considered, page 273, &c.

   3. The corruption of mankind is not the less their own moral depravity
   and sin, and they are not the less culpable and guilty, because it is
   so deeply fixed in their hearts, and they are totally corrupt and
   sinful.--This observation might be thought quite needless, and as only
   saying, that a greater degree of sinfulness is not less than a small
   degree; or that ten or a thousand degrees of moral corruption are not
   less than one degree; or that sin is not the less sinful, because it is
   so great. I say, this observation would be needless and but trifling,
   were it not too common to believe and assert the contrary, though not
   in plain and express terms; however unreasonable and absurd.

   If one degree of sinfulness, or opposition of heart to the law of God
   in any person, be wholly his own sin, and he is justly accountable for
   it, and the blame and guilt of it lies upon him; then, if he has ten,
   or a thousand degrees of evil inclination and opposition to the law of
   God; this must be all still his own sin, and he proportionably more
   criminal and blameworthy. If inclination to oppose the law of God be
   wrong and criminal; then it must be criminal in proportion to the
   strength of such inclination. And if this be the constant reigning
   inclination and choice of his heart, so as wholly to exclude every
   degree of opposite inclination and choice, he is wholly sinful, and
   criminal in proportion to the strength and constancy of his evil
   disposition, by which his heart is obstinately fixed and bent to do
   evil. This is the clear dictate of reason, and the contrary is most
   absurd, and supposes that the more strongly the heart is inclined to
   oppose God and his law, the less criminal the man is; and that when the
   heart is wholly and constantly fixed in opposition to the law of God,
   this opposition of heart to God becomes wholly innocent, so that a man
   cannot be justly condemned for it; whereas if he had less opposition to
   God, and a very small degree of it, it would be very odious and sinful!
   That the greatest possible degree of moral corruption does not excuse,
   but increase the odiousness and guilt of the man so depraved, is not
   only demonstrable by reason, but is the dictate of common sense, and
   feelings of mankind. If a person appears wholly and constantly inclined
   to falsehood, and to injure his neighbours; and if no means and
   arguments used with him, or motives set before him to desist from his
   evil conduct, have the least impression or effect upon him, to reclaim
   him; but he obstinately persists in his evil practices, we consider him
   not as innocent and blameless, because his moral depravity is so deeply
   fixed that he is incurable by any possible means; but as more odious
   and criminal in proportion to the degree and obstinacy of his incurable
   and unalterable inclination to do evil.

   It has been thought and urged by many, that fallen man cannot be wholly
   blameable for his moral depravity, because he has lost his power to do
   that which is good, and is wholly unable to change and renew his
   depraved heart. But what has been before observed, must be here kept in
   mind, that man has not lost any of his natural powers of understanding
   and will, &:c. by becoming sinful. He has lost his inclination, or is
   wholly without any inclination to serve and obey his Maker, and
   entirely opposed to it. In this his sinfulness consists; and in this
   lies his blame and guilt, and in nothing else; and the stronger and
   more fixed the opposition to the law of God is, and the farther he is
   from any inclination to obey, the more blameable and inexcusable he is,
   as has been observed and proved. So that when it is considered what
   must be meant by man's losing his power, and having no ability to do
   right, if there be any real meaning, and any thing be meant that is
   agreeable to the truth, the objection and difficulty vanishes entirely;
   and it appears that man is under no inability to obey the law of God,
   but what consists in his inclination to disobey. And it is easy to see
   that if inclination to disobey God, be it ever so strong, will excuse
   disobedience, and render it blameless; then there cannot possibly be
   any such thing as sin and blame in the universe; unless creatures may
   commit sin contrary to all their inclination and choice.

   It is certain that every degree of inclination contrary to duty, which
   is and must be sinful, necessarily implies and involves an equal degree
   of difficulty, and inability to obey. For indeed, such inclination of
   the heart to disobey, and the difficulty or inability to obey, are
   precisely one and the same. This kind of difficulty or inability,
   therefore, always is great according to the strength and fixedness of
   the inclination to disobey; and it becomes total and absolute when the
   heart is totally corrupt, and wholly opposed to obedience. But this
   inability to obey, being, the same in kind and degree with opposition
   of heart to obedience, does not excuse disobedience, or in the least
   remove the blame of it, unless opposition of heart to obedience renders
   disobedience no crime: Which none, it is presumed, will assert or
   believe.

   This leads to observe, that the holy scriptures speak frequently of
   this kind of inability, or want of power to do good; and always
   represent it as inexcusable and blameable. Our Saviour said. "No man
   can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him." And
   yet apparently blamed the Jews for rejecting, and not coming to him,
   and said to them, "Ye will not come to me, that you might have life."
   From whence it appears that the cannot, the inability mankind are under
   to come to him, is precisely the same thing with their unwillingness,
   or opposition of heart to come to him, as the matter has been stated
   above. Nothing but the opposition of the heart, or will of man, to
   coming to Christ, is, or can be in the way of his coming. So long as
   this continues, and his heart is wholly opposed to Christ, he cannot
   come to him, it is impossible, and will continue so, until his
   unwillingness, his opposition to coming to Christ, be removed by a
   change and renovation of his heart by divine grace, and he made willing
   in the day of God's power. And yet this inability, and impossibility to
   come to Christ, consisting wholly in the opposition of his will or
   heart to Christ, is the man's own sin, and he is criminal in proportion
   to the degree of his inability, or the strength and fixedness of the
   opposition of his heart to Christ.

   This kind of inability, therefore, is so far from being an excuse for
   not coming to Christ, that it is in its own nature criminal, being
   nothing but sin, a strong fixed opposition of heart to that which is
   most reasonable and right. No man can act contrary to his present
   inclination and choice. But whoever imagined that this rendered his
   inclination and choice innocent and blameless, however wrong and
   unreasonable it might be?

   St. Paul says, "the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not
   subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." None can think the
   Apostle means to excuse man's enmity against God, because it renders
   him unable to obey the law of God, and cannot be subject to it. The
   contrary is strongly expressed, viz. that this enmity against God is
   exceeding criminal, in that it is directly opposed to God and his law,
   and involves in its nature an utter inability to obey the law of God;
   yea, an absolute impossibility.

   On the whole, it is hoped that by what has been said above on the
   apostasy of man, it will appear that the doctrine of original sin has
   been stated and explained agreeable to the holy scripture; and that it
   does not imply any thing unreasonable and absurd, or injurious to
   mankind; but is the result of a constitution which is perfectly
   agreeable to the nature of things, reasonable, wise and good; that the
   children of Adam are not guilty of his sin, are not punished, and do
   not suffer for that, any farther than they implicitly or expressly
   approve of his transgression, by sinning as he did: And that their
   total moral corruption and sinfulness is as much their own sin, and as
   criminal in them, as it could be if it were not in consequence of the
   sin of the first father of the human race, or if Adam had not first
   sinned: And that they are under no inability to obey the law of God,
   which does not consist in their sinfulness and opposition of heart to
   the will of God: Therefore are wholly inexcusable, and may justly
   suffer the wages of sin, which is the second death,

   III. This subject of the introduction of sin into the world, and the
   total moral corruption of all the natural posterity of Adam, cannot be
   properly finished without observing, and more particularly considering,
   what is the nature of sin, and wherein it consists.

   The most express and concise definition of sin, which, perhaps, we have
   in the Bible, is in the following words, "Sin is the transgression of
   the law." Or, as it might perhaps more properly be rendered. Sin is a
   violation of the law; or a deviation from law. Sin supposes a law; "For
   where no law is, there is no transgression." And every motion or
   exercise of the heart of a moral agent, which is not perfectly
   conformed to the law of God, which requires all love to God with all
   their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love their neighbour as
   themselves, is sin, as it is a deviation from this law. As the law
   requires love, and nothing but love, it may be determined with great
   certainty that sin consists in that which is contrary to that love
   which the law requires, be it what it may. There can be no neutral
   moral exercises, which are neither conformable to the law of God, nor
   contrary to it; therefore every exercise of the heart of a moral agent,
   which is not agreeable to the law of God, is contrary and opposed to
   it. It must be also observed, and kept in mind, that sin. as does
   holiness, consists in the motions or exercises of the heart or will,
   and in nothing else. Where there is no exercises of heart, nothing of
   the nature of moral inclination, will or choice, there can be neither
   sin nor holiness. Nothing external or out of the heart, or will, and
   which has no connection with that, can be of the nature of morality,
   either virtue or sin: External motions or exertions, in words and
   actions, are virtuous or sinful, only as they are connected with the
   heart, and are the expressions, fruits or effects of inclination,
   design and choice; and all the virtue or sin consists wholly in the
   latter. This observation, the truth of which none can dispute, is made
   in order to direct us where to look for sin, even into the heart, and
   no where else; when we are inquiring after the nature of it, and
   wherein it consists.

   Therefore if we would find what sin is, and what is that in which it
   consists, we must look for these exercises of heart, that disposition,
   inclination or choice, in which there is no love to God and our
   neighbour; and which are contrary to loving God with all the heart, and
   our neighbour as ourselves. And if we can find, and on sure ground
   determine, what these are, we shall know what is the nature of sin, and
   wherein it essentially consists.

   Love to God, and love to our fellow creatures, is of the same nature
   and kind, and differs only as it is exercised towards different
   objects. It consists most essentially in benevolence or good w ill to
   being in general: In this is necessarily included all virtuous love, or
   all the love which the law of God requires, such as love of complacency
   in moral beauty and excellence, and love of gratitude to benevolent
   beings, &c. Love to God, who is infinitely the greatest, and the sum of
   all being, consists primarily and essentially in good will or
   friendship of heart towards him, in acquiescing and rejoicing in his
   existence, glory, and infinite felicity, and in seeking the promotion
   of his interest and honour, &c. And this implies all the virtuous love
   required in the divine law: And where there is no degree of this kind,
   disinterested affection, there is no virtuous love to God or man. If
   this were not so evident from the nature of things, it is capable of
   being proved from scripture many ways. The apostle John says, "God is
   love." And then proceeds immediately to say, "In this was manifested
   the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son
   into the world, that we might live through him." This is love of pure,
   disinterested benevolence, to creatures infinitely odious and guilty.
   This is the love meant when he said, "God is love;" for this is
   introduced to illustrate that assertion. Hence it follows with
   certainty, that disinterested benevolence is primary and essential in
   the divine moral character. Consequently, this is the love which is
   required of creatures in the divine law: For the law of God is a
   transcript of his own moral perfection; and so far as creatures are
   conformed to this, they are like God in his moral character, and
   partakers of the divine nature; and exercise the same kind of love and
   holiness which forms the moral character of God. St. Paul gives a
   particular description of the love in which holiness consists; [202]
   and he says, "It is kind," that is, it is benevolent, and good will to
   others, consequently to being in general, and to God, the first and sum
   of all being. He also says, "It seeketh not her own," by which
   assertion he sets it in direct opposition to self love, for in the
   exercise of this a man seeketh his own, and nothing else; and he makes
   it wholly a disinterested affection; for if holy love seeketh not her
   own, it seeketh the good of being in general, as her only object, and
   cannot have the least degree of selfishness in its nature; but is
   directly opposed to it.

   That the love to our fellow creatures required in the law of God, is
   love of benevolence, which is disinterested, is certain, as it is a
   love which will extend to those who have no moral excellence, even
   those of the worst moral character, and to our greatest enemies,
   towards whom a virtuous love either of complacence or gratitude cannot
   be exercised. And it follows from this also, that the love to God which
   is required, is love of disinterested benevolence: for, as has been
   observed, the love to God, and to our neighbour, which the law of God
   requires, is of the same nature and kind, and the one implies and
   involves the other. And this is the farther evident and certain, from
   the apostle's considering the love of christians, as of the same nature
   and kind with this disinterested love of God, in this passage; and from
   his exhorting them to imitate God in this his disinterested
   benevolence, by loving as he does. "Beloved, if God so loved us, we
   ought also to love one another. If we love one another, God dwelleth in
   us, and his love is perfected in us."

   It being thus evident that the love required in the divine law, in
   which holiness consists, is disinterested benevolence, which is primary
   and most essential in all virtuous love; and in which all is included;
   it appears from what has been observed, that sin consists in that
   affection and those exercises, which are directly opposed to
   disinterested benevolence to being in general, and all those affections
   and exercises which are implied in true benevolence or good will to
   others. And this must be self love, or selfish affection and exercises;
   for this, and this only is, or can be opposed to disinterested regard
   and good will to other beings; and to all those exercises which are
   implied in true benevolence. If a person has no other exercises but
   self love, or the love of his own self, and those moral inclinations
   and affections which are implied in this, he does by the supposition
   regard himself only, and has respect to nothing but his own supposed
   good or interest; and cannot exercise the least degree of disinterested
   affection to any other being. And as that heart whose exercises may be
   all resolved into self love, being implied in it, and flowing from it,
   does not, and cannot exercise any true benevolence to other beings, but
   is wholly opposed to it; so every degree of self love, be there more or
   less, is in its own nature opposed to the love required in the divine
   law: And therefore is in its nature, and in every degree of it, sin,
   being contrary to true holiness. And if a person be not wholly selfish,
   but exercises some degree of disinterested regard and good will to
   other beings; yet every degree of self love which he exercises is as
   opposite to disinterested affection, as if he had no benevolence; and
   therefore as sinful. The nature of self love is not changed from sin to
   holiness, nor does it become an innocent affection, by the exercise of
   a degree of opposite disinterested affection, or by being diminished,
   as to the degree of it, so as to be exerted with less strength and
   vigour, and in a measure counteracted by opposite affection. Still
   every exertion of self love is as really sin, as if it were exercised
   in a higher degree, and were not restrained and counteracted by
   opposite, disinterested love. No one does or can suppose that
   benevolent affection changes its nature, and becomes wrong and sinful,
   by being exercised in a low degree, and counteracted, and kept very
   much under by selfishness: But this might be as reasonably supposed, as
   that selfishness does become innocent and virtuous, when exercised in a
   small degree, and under the restraints of benevolence to being in
   general. Yea, if the latter be true or possible, the former must be so
   too.

   Hence it is evident, that sin consists in sell love, and those
   affections and exercises which are implied in this, and naturally flow
   from it as their root. This is in its own nature opposite to all
   virtuous, holy affection, to all truth and reason; and is of a criminal
   nature, in every degree of it, wherever it is found; and where there is
   nothing of this, there is nothing criminal or wrong. Self love pays a
   supreme and sole regard to an infinitely small and inconsiderable part
   of existence, and the feeling and language of all the exercises of it
   is, "I am, and there is none else! There is no other being worthy of
   any regard, but myself." "Self love regards nothing but self, as such,
   and subordinates every being and every thing to this; and opposes every
   thing which, in the view of the selfish person, opposes him, and his
   selfish interest. He who is under the government of this affection,
   takes all to himself, and gives nothing to any other being, as if he
   was the greatest, the best, and only worthy and important being in the
   universe.

   Self love is the root of all pride; or rather is pride itself, as there
   is no distinction to be made of which there can be any conception.
   Pride is self love exercised in self esteem, and desire to exalt self,
   &:c. Self love is blindness and delusion itself, as it is a
   contradiction to all truth; and is the source of all the blindness and
   delusions with respect to things temporal and spiritual, which have or
   can ever take place. This sets man against God, and his fellow
   creatures, and against himself, that is, against his true interest, and
   renders him really miserable; and prepares him to be completely
   miserable forever, unless it be removed. In short, there can be no kind
   or degree of moral depravity which has appeared among men, or of which
   there can be any conception, which does not consist in self love, in
   the various exercises and fruits of it: And where there is no
   selfishness, there is no sin, there can be no deviation from the law of
   God.

   Therefore when the apostle Paul speaks of the nature of sin, and that
   in which he found it to consist when he came to the knowledge of it, he
   comprehends it all in selfishness, or coveting, which is the same. He
   says, "I had not known sin, but by the law: For I had not known lust,
   except the law had said. Thou shalt not covet." He refers to the tenth
   command in the decalogue, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house,
   &c. nor any thing that is thy neighbour's." Coveting that to ourselves,
   which belongs to others, is an exercise of self love. In this the
   apostle represents sin to consist; even in the inmost latent exercises
   of this selfishness in the heart, being the root and fountain of all
   sin. Agreeable to this, the same apostle, when he describes the great
   degree of vice and wickedness which shall take place in the last days,
   sets self love at the head, as the source and root of the whole. "This
   know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men
   shall be lovers of their own selves; covetous, boasters, proud, &:c."
   [203] Any one who will attentively read over this catalogue of
   iniquity, will see, that every vice here mentioned, is implied in the
   self love which is first introduced, and is only a different
   modification of that which men will practise because they are lovers of
   their own selves: and consequently act out this self love in a variety
   of forms, which therefore are called by these different names.

   It therefore appears, that as holiness is, in the holy scripture,
   reduced to one simple principle, love, and made to consist wholly in
   this, by which is evidently meant disinterested good will to being in
   general, capable of happiness, with all that affection necessarily
   included in this; so sin is there represented as consisting in the
   simple principle or exercise of self love, which, in its own nature,
   comprehends all sin, every exercise and affection which is a deviation
   from the divine law; and is directly and wholly opposed to that love
   which this law requires. [204]

   It has been said, that every degree of self love cannot be sin, but
   must be lawful and right, since it is reasonable that we should have
   some regard, at least, for ourselves, and desire and seek our own
   interest and happiness, not inconsistent with that of others; and were
   there no self love, men could not be influenced by promises and
   threatening; and there would be no propriety in these, of which the
   Bible is full. Besides, the command to love our neighbour supposes and
   enjoins self love. "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Here the
   love of our own selves is mentioned as the stated measure, by which our
   love to others is to be regulated. If we are forbid to exercise any
   degree of self love, the command is inconsistent, and comes to nothing.

   Upon this it may be observed, that a person may have and exercise a
   proper regard for himself, and desire and seek his own interest and
   happiness, without the least degree of the self love which is opposed
   to disinterested benevolence, or which is not implied in it. The person
   who exercises disinterested good will to being in general must have a
   proper and proportionable regard to himself; as he belongs to being in
   general, and is included in it, as a necessary part of it. It is
   impossible he should love being in general, or universal being, and not
   love himself; because he is included in universal being. And the more
   he has of a disinterested, universal benevolence, and the stronger his
   exercises of it are, the more regard will he have to his own being, and
   the more fervently will he desire and seek his own interest and
   happiness. But here it must be observed, that he will not desire and
   seek it as his own, or because it is his own interest, considered as
   distinct and detached from the interest of the whole, or of being in
   general; but as included in it. Thus disinterested benevolence to being
   in general loves our neighbour as ourselves; in which there is nothing
   selfish, but ourselves are loved as included in the general object of
   disinterested love. The least degree of selfish love necessarily
   destroys all due proportion, and sets up a selfish interest detached
   from that of others, and injurious to the whole. It is in the very
   nature of it an enemy to the harmony and happiness of the whole, and
   breaks in upon it, and tends to spread confusion and evil through the
   whole, in opposition to universal benevolence; and is inconsistent with
   our loving our neighbour as ourselves; but, by the supposition, loves
   self and nothing else. Hence it appears that the command, "Thou shalt
   love thy neighbour as thyself," excludes and forbids all self love, or
   selfishness, and enjoins that disinterested love to the whole, which
   necessarily includes a proper and proportionable love and regard to our
   own existence and interest, as implied in that of the whole. And in
   this view of the matter, it appears that he who has disinterested
   benevolence to the whole may be influenced by promises and
   threatenings, and is as proper a subject of them, and more so, than the
   most selfish person in the world. [205]

   Thus it appears from scripture, and the reason and nature of things,
   that the sin which entered into the world by one man, the father of the
   human race, and has spread to all his children, by which they are
   totally corrupted, and involved in guilt and ruin, consists wholly in
   self love. Nothing but that which has the nature of selfishness is sin;
   and this is in its own nature, and in every degree, a transgression of
   the law of God, and contrary to true holiness. It is useful and
   important that we should have this scriptural idea of holiness and sin,
   as it will put us under advantage to know how far we ourselves are
   sinful, or what is sin in us, as well as to judge of the moral
   corruption of mankind.

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. IN the part the devil acted in seducing man, and leading him off
   into rebellion against God, may be seen the nature and tendency of sin,
   and what is the disposition or inclination of the sinner. When Satan
   became a rebel against his Maker, his inclination and desire was to
   disappoint and dethrone him, if possible, and to spread rebellion
   through the universe; and he wished to have every creature that
   existed, or ever should exist, to join with him, and do as he had done:
   And his sinning had a mighty tendency to this, and did accomplish it,
   so far as his influence reached, and had its natural effect. He
   actually drew off into rebellion with him myriads of angels. And had it
   been in his power, and had not God prevented it, he would have drawn
   them all off from obedience to God. He wished to extinguish all
   holiness from the universe. He acted out this disposition, this enmity
   against God and man, and all holiness, in seducing man, and spreading
   sin and ruin through this world.

   Sin in man is of the same nature and kind with the sin of the devil, by
   which man is inclined to do as he does, and in which man has joined
   with him, to desire and pursue the same thing which he seeks; and it
   tends to produce the same effects, the sin and ruin of the whole
   universe. Therefore our Saviour says to the Jews, "Ye are of your
   father, the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do." [206] That
   is, ye are of the same disposition with the devil, and desire and
   pursue the same things. "He that committeth sin is of the devil." [207]
   Here we are to look to see the nature and tendency of sin, when acted
   out, and the inclination and choice of the sinner; and to learn our own
   character as sinners, in which we imitate the devil, and exercise the
   same desires and lusts of self-love and pride, in which his first
   rebellion consisted; and in which consists his obstinate perseverance
   in disobedience, and all his attempts against God and man. This, if
   properly considered, will lead us to view ourselves, and the character
   of mankind, in a much worse light than that in which men generally view
   themselves; and will serve to discover the infinite evil of all sin, as
   tending, and desiring and attempting, to spread unbounded mischief, and
   infinite natural evil through the universe. The consequence is, that
   the sinner deserves to be punished with infinite evil, or everlasting
   destruction.

   Doubtless one reason why it was so ordered that one, the first act of
   sin, should spread total corruption and ruin over all the countless
   myriads of the human race, was to discover to all intelligent creatures
   the evil nature and tendency of sin. This constitution, as has been
   observed, was only ordaining that sin should, in this respect, have its
   natural course, and spread, agreeable to the inclination and desire of
   the first transgressor, through all his posterity; And hereby the evil
   there is in every act of sin, is held up to the view of men and angels,
   discovering to all that it deserves the endless punishment threatened
   in the divine law.

   Let no one then condemn Satan for his rebellion and persisting in
   sinning, while he justifies himself, or even thinks better of himself,
   who is doing the same thing, and rendering himself like the devil, and
   joining with him, and justifying him, by every act of sin of which he
   is guilty. Nor let any of the children of Adam object to the
   constitution which connects their sin with his; nor complain of the sin
   of their common father, while they are disposed to excuse and justify
   themselves in that conduct by which they consent to his sinning as he
   did, and imitate him, and desire to spread sin and ruin as far as he
   has done, and would do it, were it in their power; and which they are
   attempting to do, even in making the objection. Rather let all condemn,
   and humble themselves in the sight of the Lord, for their joining with
   Satan in rebellion, and imitating and justifying Adam in his
   transgression, and doing what they could to spread and perpetuate
   disobedience. And let all adore and give glory to almighty power,
   infinite wisdom and goodness to that glorious Being, who does in any
   degree counteract sin and the sinner; and in any instance prevent the
   just and natural consequences of it; and turn all to his own glory, and
   the greatest good of his kingdom.

   II. From the history of the apostasy of man, and the way in which sin
   entered into the world, we are warned of the folly and danger of
   disregarding divine revelation, and giving the least heed to any
   assertions or suggestions which are contrary to the revealed will of
   God, or which are not warranted by that.

   The first suggestion which Satan made was contrary to that which God
   had declared; and by giving heed to that, sin was introduced, and has
   brought sin and ruin on all mankind. And this same deceiver and father
   of lies has at all times since, and does now, in various ways, attempt
   to lead men to disregard what God has said in his word, and believe
   those things which are not warranted by it, but are really contrary to
   those divine oracles. And so far as he succeeds, he gets the advantage
   of men; and in this way they fall into his snare, and are led captive
   by him. This is the continued source of all the sinful practices in the
   world, and of all the delusions and false religions which take place
   among mankind.

   With what care and circumspection does it become us to examine every
   doctrine and practice which is proposed or suggested to us as right and
   true; and to reject with resolution and abhorrence every thing of this
   kind, which is not agreeable to the oracles of God! Upon this law and
   testimony we ought to keep our eye, with constant, painful care and
   study, to understand it, and a readiness immediately to reject every
   thing which is not warranted by that, as dangerous delusion, from
   whatever quarter, or by whomsoever it may be proposed, and however
   plausible and tempting it may be.

   III. The particular suggestion of Satan, contrary to revealed truth, by
   which he tempted our mother Eve to transgress, is worthy to be
   considered as a warning to us. "The serpent said unto the woman, Ye
   shall not surely die." By hearkening to this lie of Satan she fell into
   sin and ruin. We may be sure the devil has been ever since urging this
   same lie upon men, as the great and principal delusion by which he
   holds them secure in his snare, and tempts them to go on boldly in
   rebellion. Those who are persuaded to believe this lie, which Satan
   tries by all means and ways in his power to propagate, are fallen into
   his snare; and in their attempts to promote it, they are his
   instruments and servants; and he influences them to the utmost of his
   power to make their bands strong, and to heighten their confidence,
   that they shall have peace, and no evil shall come upon them, though
   they walk after the imagination of their own hearts: And they have his
   assistance in searching and studying the scriptures to find passages,
   and to pervert them, so as to strengthen themselves and others in this
   dangerous delusion, by which their hearts are steeled against any
   impression by the many awful threatenings in the word of God.

   And where he cannot persuade men to believe there is no future
   punishment for impenitent sinners, he does all he can to keep them
   stupid and thoughtless, with respect to it, and make them feel and act
   as if they were exposed to no such punishment; and to flatter
   themselves with peace and safety, until sudden destruction cometh upon
   them. This is one special mean of holding men in security and ease in
   sin, in the christian world. And Satan has great advantage against
   mankind, in promoting this delusion, because it is agreeable to their
   hearts, and it is the nature of sin to be pleased with it, and to make
   men stupid and unbelieving with respect to the reality and dreadfulness
   of future punishment, and the danger in which they are of falling into
   it.

   Let all beware of this delusion, by which sin first entered into the
   world, and which has been the mean of thousands and millions falling
   into that endless punishment, which they have not believed, or not
   realized, that it would ever come. "Though hand join in hand, the
   wicked shall not be unpunished." "Wo unto the wicked, it shall be ill
   with him; for the reward of his hands shall be given him: Who shall be
   punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
   and the glory of his power."

   Let the ministers of the gospel, the watchmen on the walls of
   Jerusalem, not be silent, but cry aloud, and warn the wicked, to whom
   God has said, Ye shall surely die; and sound an alarm to all the secure
   in their sins, if by any means, they may be awakened from their deadly
   sleep, and delivered from their delusions, and fly from the wrath to
   come, before it shall be too late.

   IV. This subject leads us to see and reflect upon the infinitely
   guilty, miserable and lost state into which mankind are fallen by sin.
   They begin to sui, as soon as they are capable of moral exercise; and
   by one sinful exercise, were they guilty of no more, they undo
   themselves forever, if not delivered by mere sovereign grace. All their
   exercises are wrong and sinful, by which they are growing more and more
   guilty and ill deserving; and all the light they have, and the favours
   they enjoy, being abused, render them unspeakably criminal. They are so
   wholly inclined to sin, and with such strength and obstinacy of heart,
   fixed in enmity against God and his law, that they stand ready to
   oppose all means and every method that can be taken and used to recover
   them from sin and reclaim them; and if left to themselves, will only
   wax worse and worse, until they plunge into endless ruin, and
   intolerable misery. They are continually provoking God to cast them
   into everlasting destruction, on whose sovereign mercy they depend
   every moment, to save them from dropping into hell; and by whose
   forfeited grace, and almighty power alone, they can be recovered to
   repentance, and from sin and infinite evil. And at the same time they
   are flattering themselves in their evil ways, involved in the darkness
   and delusion of sin; loving darkness, and hating the light, and cannot
   be told in what an infinitely evil and dangerous case they are; that
   is, cannot be made to believe it, though they be told, and are ready to
   hate their best and only friends, and look upon them as their enemies;
   while they love their enemies, who are doing all they can to destroy
   them forever. But who can describe, or fully conceive the sinful,
   miserable, ruined condition into which mankind are fallen; and in which
   we all naturally are, and shall be forever, unless delivered by
   infinite, sovereign grace!

   sin of the heart, while not thus expressed. But the latter is as really
   actual sin, as the former. Therefore there is no ground for calling one
   actual sin, and the other not. Original sin is that total moral
   depravity, which takes place in the hearts of all the children of Adam,
   in consequence of his apostasy, which consists in exercise or act, as

   says, "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law; therefore love is
   the fulfilling of the law." (Rom. 13 ) And, as has been observed, he
   represents sin as consisting in the coveting what belongs to others,
   which is forbidden in the tenth command; which is self love. The love
   required, gives all to being in general, and reserves and desires
   nothing to self, as self, or as an object distinct from universal
   being. The self love forbidden, covets and seeks all to self, as such,
   as distinguished from being in general, and opposite to it. It gives
   nothing to any other being, but, so far as its grasp can reach, takes
   and holds all good to self, as such, and as opposed to every other
   being; and seeks to subordinate every other being and thing to his own
   self, will and interest. The former is required as that in which all
   holiness consists. The latter is forbidden, as the root and essence of
   all sin.

   [205] This subject is more particularly considered in "An Inquiry into
   the Nature of True Holiness," published in the year 1773, and reprinted
   at New-York, in the year 1791 To which the reader is referred, who

CHAP. I.

   Some general Observations on the Redemption of Man.

   1. WE depend wholly on divine revelation for all we know concerning the
   redemption of man. By this only we learn, that it is possible that man
   may be recovered from a state of sin and ruin; and that God has
   determined to redeem man, and is prosecuting this design. And by this
   only we can know what is implied in this, and what is the way and
   manner in which it is effected.

   Man might justly be left to endless destruction, without any remedy,
   having fallen under the curse of the divine law, which is righteous and
   good. And that he could be saved consistent with this law, and the
   maintenance and honour of divine government, could not be known by any
   creature. And if it were known that it was possible for man to be
   delivered and saved, consistent with the honour of the divine law and
   government, it could not be known that God would see fit to do it,
   until he revealed his will and design in this matter. God was
   infinitely far from being under any obligations to show favour to man;
   it depended upon his sovereign will to determine whether man should be
   redeemed, or not: and if he were redeemed, it must be by the most free,
   undeserved sovereign mercy. Therefore that God Would show any mercy to
   sinners, could not be known by men or angels; or that this was
   possible, consistent with the holy law of God, and with wisdom and
   righteousness. This was hid in God from all creatures, until he was
   pleased to reveal his design. This indeed was done immediately upon the
   apostasy of man; and this important and glorious purpose of God has
   been opening more and more from that time to this: Which has been
   suited to excite and increase the attention and wonder of men and
   angels, through all ages.

   In this revelation is comprehended what God has made known by
   declarations, promises and predictions in the holy scriptures, and by
   his providence, in ordering the events recorded in the historical part
   of scripture, and accomplishing many things which he has promised or
   predicted; by which the declarations, promises and prophecies are
   opened and explained, and light is thrown upon this grand design; while
   the word of God, and his providence in governing the world, and
   ordering all events, do most exactly agree and illustrate each other.

   And the providence of God, as it respects the natural world, considered
   by itself, unconnected with his word in the holy scriptures, in
   preserving mankind, and giving them ease and health, and so many
   comforts and good things in this life, carries a language in it, and is
   a kind and degree of revelation of the disposition and will of God,
   declaring not only the being of God, and his universal and particular
   providence, and care of all his creatures; but also that he is good and
   kind to man in a sense and degree which is inconsistent with his being
   cast off without hope; and is a standing evidence to all who have
   proper discerning, that God is propitious to the human race; and that
   there is some way in which he may be reconciled, and show mercy to
   sinners. This seems to be the sentiment expressed by St. Paul in the
   following words. "Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in
   their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in
   that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
   filling our hearts with food and gladness." [208]

   The witness or testimony of which the apostle here speaks, which was
   given to mankind in general by God, in his doing them good, and which
   was constantly held up in divine providence, was not merely of his
   existence, but of his kind care of man, and his readiness to be
   reconciled to him, without particularly pointing out the way and method
   in which this could be effected. This was a sufficient ground to excite
   their hope, and induce them to seek after him, and make all possible
   inquiries and search after the way in which they might obtain mercy;
   and to find what was necessary in order to their being saved. And God
   has so ordered the situation and bounds of mankind, both under the
   Mosaic and christian dispensation, that all who would take proper
   notice of this witness in divine providence, and improve it as they
   ought, and might do, might come to the knowledge of the truth They who
   lived before the incarnation of Christ could not fail of coming to the
   knowledge of the revelation given to the Israelites. And all mankind
   who have lived since might have come to the knowledge of the truth
   revealed by Christ and his apostles. This is asserted by St. Paul. "And
   hath made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell in all the face of
   the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the
   bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply
   they might feel after him, and find him." [209]

   Many who pay no regard to a written revelation have supposed that the
   dictates of reason, without any particular revelation from God, did
   assure them that he must pardon and receive to favour every penitent
   sinner, as it would be inconsistent with his goodness not to do it;
   therefore mankind want no other revelation from God to give them a
   certainty of this. But they have never been able to give any
   satisfactory evidence of this to those who properly attend to the
   matter; and what they call reason, appears to be presumption, when
   examined by impartial enlightened reason. There is nothing within the
   reach of the reason and knowledge of creatures that can afford the
   least evidence that God will pardon the penitent sinner, merely because
   he repents; or that this could be done consistent with the most perfect
   moral government; but the contrary appears most reasonable, viz. that
   the repentance of the criminal is not sufficient to give him any claim
   to forgiveness. And it is very evident and certain that such an opinion
   is inconsistent with real repentance; and that while a sinner thinks
   that his repentance will give a claim to forgiveness and favour, he is
   a stranger to true repentance, and never will repent, until he gives it
   up. Nor can he have the least evidence that any of mankind will ever
   repent, if left to themselves, and are not the subjects of those divine
   influences to which they have no claim, and which they have no reason
   to conclude God will grant. But this matter will be made more evident
   as we proceed on the subject of redemption.

   II. Redemption does not extend to all sinful, fallen creatures, but
   many are left to suffer the just consequence of their rebellion, in
   everlasting punishment. No mercy has been extended to the fallen
   angels, of whom there are vast numbers. "For God spared not the angels
   that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and hath reserved them in
   everlasting chains of darkness, unto the judgment of the great day,"
   [210] when they are to receive their final sentence to eternal
   punishment. [211] And it is expressly and repeatedly declared in divine
   revelation that a part of mankind shall also be punished forever. To
   which they shall be sentenced, together with the fallen angels, at the
   judgment of the great day. [212]

   This distinction, made between the fallen angels and mankind, and in
   favour of the latter, is not because man might not have been justly
   left to eternal ruin, or because he was less unworthy of mercy, and not
   so ill deserving, as the apostate angels; but for reasons in the view
   of infinite wisdom, which may, at least the most of them, be wholly out
   of our sight at present. As light and knowledge shall increase in the
   churchy the wisdom of God in this dispensation of sovereign grace will
   be more and more seen; and there will be an increasing discovery of
   this to angels and the redeemed in the eternal kingdom of God.

   We are also certain that infinite wisdom saw it best that redemption
   should not extend to all mankind, so that every one of the human race
   should be actually saved, though we were not able to see the reason of
   this, and the contrary should appear to us to be most wise and best;
   for we are infinitely far from being competent judges in this case; and
   there is the highest reason that we should acquiesce, and be satisfied
   with the declaration and conduct of the infinitely wise and benevolent
   Being, who is able, and to whom it belonged to determine whether all
   the human race should be saved or not. For we are sure that it is
   determined perfectly right, and that all mankind could not be actually
   redeemed, consistent with the good of the whole, or consistent with
   wisdom and goodness.

   It also belongs to the supreme, infinitely wise and benevolent Being to
   determine what number and proportion of mankind shall be saved, and fix
   upon every individual person, since all this depends upon him, and he
   has a right to do as he pleases, and he only knows what is most wise
   and best. "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
   make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"

   We are not in express words of revelation informed what proportion of
   mankind shall be saved, whether the greater or less part of them, on
   the whole. But perhaps more is revealed with respect to this than has
   been supposed, and which is contrary to what has been generally thought
   to be asserted in the scriptures. It has been thought by many, that
   when Christ says, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which
   leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Many are called, but
   few chosen. Fear not little flock," he declares that but few, a very
   small part of mankind, shall be saved. But when we attend to these
   words of Christ, we shall find that they are spoken of the then present
   time; and nothing is asserted concerning that which shall take place in
   future ages; and therefore have no relation to the point before us, and
   determine nothing about it. When this question was put to him, "Lord,
   are there few that shall be saved?" He did not think proper to answer
   it then, by expressly affirming or denying; but only said, that many
   should not be saved; and improved this truth to excite all to secure
   their own salvation, without delay: Which is consistent with there
   being many more saved than lost.

   When we attend to the many predictions of the flourishing, greatness
   and extent of the church and kingdom of Christ in the last days, so as
   to fill the whole world, when "the kingdom and dominion, and the
   greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the
   people of the saints of the Most High;" and are assured that this state
   of prosperity shall continue, at least a thousand years, we shall find
   no reason to conclude that but few of mankind will be saved, in
   comparison with those who shall perish; but see ground to believe that
   the number of the former will far exceed that of the latter. [213] But
   were there nothing revealed by which we could determine any thing with
   respect to this, we might well rest satisfied that God, who is
   infinitely wise and good, has fixed the number of those who shall be
   saved, and of those who shall not be saved, so as exactly to answer the
   best end, and promote the greatest general good; and may be as certain
   that many of mankind w ill perish forever, as we can be that the Bible
   is a revelation from God, since this is there so expressly, abundantly,
   and in such a variety of ways declared and established.

   III. The Redemption of man is the greatest instance of the exercise and
   manifestation of the benevolence, or the love and goodness of God, that
   ever took place, or that ever will. It is the greatest possible
   exercise and display of divine benevolence; in which there is the best
   and most ample ground and scope for the highest increasing and endless
   discovery of the love and goodness of the infinitely benevolent Being.

   The benevolence of the Deity is exercised, and appears in all his
   works; but in the work of redemption is the fullest, most perfect and
   bright display of the divine love, as all the works of God have
   reference to this as their result and end, in which his design in all
   is manifested. This is every where set in this light in the Holy
   Scripture. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." [214] God is love. In this was manifested the love of God
   towards us, that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we
   might live through him. Herein is love, not that we have loved God, but
   that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
   Behold! What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
   should be called the sons of God." [215]

   Thus the sacred oracles celebrate the work of redemption as the highest
   and most remarkable instance of divine love, and direct us there, to
   behold it acted out in the highest degree, and to the greatest
   advantage, to be seen and admired by creatures; as an inexhaustible and
   endless object of gratitude and praise.

   The reason and propriety of this representation in divine revelation,
   and that the work of redemption is infinitely the greatest instance and
   display of divine benevolence, will in some measure appear, if the
   following things be well considered.

   1. Benevolence exercised in the bestowment of favour, is greater or
   less, according to the greater or less unworthiness and ill desert of
   those who are the objects of the benevolence. If those on whom good is
   bestowed, be worthy or deserving, the granting that good or benefit, is
   really paying a debt, and is an act of justice. And though benevolence
   may be exercised in doing this, as it is contrary to benevolence not to
   give what is deserved; yet the goodness exercised in this case is not
   so apparently disinterested; nor does it require so great a degree of
   goodness, as it does to bestow favours on the unworthy and ill
   deserving. The latter is free grace, sovereign, disinterested goodness:
   the former may not be so. And the more unworthy and ill deserving they
   are to whom favour is shown, the greater is the degree of benevolence
   exercised in granting the favour: For it requires a greater degree of
   benevolence to shew kindness to those who deserve no good, but evil,
   than to be kind to those who have no ill desert; and the degree of
   benevolence exercised in granting favour, is in proportion to the
   degree of ill desert of those who are the subjects of it.

   In this respect the divine benevolence appears to be unbounded and
   wonderful in the redemption of man. Man, by rebellion against his
   Maker, is become infinitely unworthy and ill deserving, as he is
   infinitely criminal. And he does not only sin in one, or a few
   instances, but is wholly a rebel, and become a total enemy to God.
   Mankind have taken up arms against Heaven, and they are universally and
   constantly acting out their opposition and enmity against God, with
   great strength, obstinacy and violence. "Every imagination of the
   thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually. The heart of the sons
   of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart, while they live.
   There is none that doeth good, no, not one. They are all gone out of
   the way. Their throat is an open sepulchre. The poison of asps is under
   their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet
   are swift to shed blood. There is no fear of God before their eyes."
   They will not be reclaimed from their rebellion and enmity against God
   by any methods that can betaken to bring them to submit and return to
   obedience, short of taking away their rebellious heart by almighty
   power immediately exerted, and creating them anew. But the more favour
   is shown to them, and the greater the kindness is which they receive,
   the more will they rebel and act against their greatest benefactor,
   abusing, despising, and trampling upon all his goodness to them; they
   being "desperately wicked," and wholly irreclaimable by any means,
   provoking their Maker to destroy them, to the utmost of their power.
   This was all seen by the omniscient Jehovah. And no benevolence short
   of infinite could be disposed to spare, and show favour to such
   infinitely criminal, ill deserving, odious, and God provoking,
   obstinate enemies as men were. Therefore the redemption of such
   creatures calls for the strongest exercise, and gives the brightest
   display of divine, infinite benevolence or goodness. St. Paul sets it
   in this light in the following words. "Scarcely for a righteous man
   will one die; yet, peradventure, for a good man some would even dare to
   die. But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet
   sinners, and when we were enemies, Christ died for us." [216]

   2. The greater the evil is from which any one is delivered by
   undeserved goodness, the greater and the more perspicuous is the
   benevolence which is exercised in such deliverance; and the more
   gratitude to the benefactor is due from him who is delivered. In the
   case before us there is the most ample room for the exercise and
   display of benevolence, in this respect. Man was fallen into a state of
   infinite misery and wretchedness, under the curse of the divine law,
   which implies separation from all good and happiness, and the suffering
   all the evil of which he is capable, without end. This man must have
   suffered forever without the least mitigation or relief, had not
   redemption taken place. By his apostasy man was become a vassal to
   Satan, and his heart was wholly under the power of moral depravity,
   from which nothing could deliver him but the mighty arm of Omnipotence.
   From this complicated, infinitely evil state, every one is completely
   delivered, who shares in redemption by Christ. Nothing short of the
   exertion of infinite, omnipotent, all sufficient benevolence, is
   sufficient to rescue man from this infinitely guilty, miserable state.

   3. The exercise and expression of benevolence is strong and great in
   proportion to the degree of positive good and happiness which is
   bestowed.

   Deliverance from evil is a benefit, and may be called a negative good;
   and this benefit is great in proportion to the degree of evil from
   which deliverance is granted. And the degree of benevolence expressed
   in such deliverance is great, in proportion to the greatness of the
   evil from which the miserable subject is delivered. This has been
   considered under the foregoing particular. What is now brought into
   view is the degree of positive good which is bestowed by benevolence. A
   less degree of benevolence may procure and give a small benefit, which
   is insufficient to prompt to bestow a much greater benefit. Therefore
   the greater the benefit is, which is given, the greater is the exercise
   and manifestation of that goodness which wills and procures it. In the
   redemption of man, the positive good procured and bestowed is
   infinitely great, being great and increasing in degree, and in duration
   endless. It is everlasting life, in the most happy and honourable
   circumstances possible. Nothing short of the infinite love of the
   omnipotent, all sufficient jehovah, can give such infinite good to
   infinitely ill deserving rebels. In this view, infinite benevolence is
   exercised and most conspicuously displayed in the redemption of man.
   Inspired with the view and sense of this, St. John exclaims, "Behold,
   what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
   called the sons of God! Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
   doth not yet appear what we shall be: But we know that, when he shall
   appear, we shall be like him." In the redemption of man an unbounded
   field is opened in which divine benevolence is displayed to the best
   advantage, and God "fulfils all the good pleasure of his goodness," in
   bestowing infinite happiness and glory on the redeemed; unspeakably
   greater than man could have enjoyed, had he not sinned, and rendered
   himself infinitely unworthy of the least favour; and infinitely more
   "to the praise of his rich and glorious grace."

   4. The greater the difficulties and obstacles are, which must be
   removed or surmounted, in order to bestow a favour, and the greater the
   expense, cost and trouble, which are necessary, in order to procure it,
   the greater and more strong is the exercise of goodness in procuring:
   and bestowing the benefit. This is so evident that no proof or
   illustration is necessary.

   There were difficulties and impediments which must be removed, and such
   infinite expense and sufferings were necessary, in order to redeem man,
   which could not be effected by any thing short of infinite power,
   wisdom and goodness. Man had fallen under the curse of the righteous
   and perfect law of God. It was inconsistent with rectoral
   righteousness, and infinite goodness; to set aside, or disregard this
   law, in favour of rebellious man, so as to pardon and receive him to
   favour, without paying any regard to the execution of the curse
   threatened, in any sense or degree. It was of infinite importance that
   the law and moral government should be maintained, and the curse
   threatened, properly and fully executed. This put man out of the reach
   of divine infinite goodness, Unless some expedient could be found, some
   way be devised, in which the law of God might be regarded and
   maintained, and the penalty of it executed, consistent with pardoning
   and shewing favour to man. This rendered it necessary that God himself,
   in the second person of the adorable Trinity, should assume human
   nature into a personal union, so as to form one person, who is both God
   and man; and that this person should, in the human nature, be made
   under the law, and support and honour it by obeying the precepts, and
   suffering the curse of it, in the room and stead of man. In this way
   only could man be delivered from the curse of the law, and obtain
   complete redemption, consistent with divine truth, rectoral
   righteousness, wisdom and goodness. Had not all this been necessary in
   order to redeem man, and might he be saved consistent with the divine
   law, without such a Mediator, doing and suffering all this, the love
   and grace exercised in redeeming and saving him would have been
   infinitely less, and as nothing compared with that benevolence which is
   expressed in the incarnation, humiliation, death and sufferings of the
   Son of God, which are necessarily implied in this redemption. God the
   Father giving his Son, and the Son of God giving himself, to suffer an
   ignominious, cruel death, and be made a curse, that sinners, his
   enemies, might be redeemed from the curse, and have eternal life, is an
   infinitely greater gift, and higher exercise and expression of
   disinterested love or benevolence, than merely to save man from eternal
   destruction, and give him endless life, could the latter be done
   without the former.

   This is the light in which the holy scripture sets this matter. There
   this is represented as the greatest, most remarkable and glorious
   instance and display of divine benevolence, that God has given his Son
   to die, and Christ has given himself unto death as a ransom, to deliver
   sinners from hell, and procure eternal life for them. "God so loved the
   world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
   him should not perish, but have everlasting life." [217] "God
   commendeth (displays in the most amiable, and brightest light) his love
   towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
   [218] "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
   life for us. In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because
   that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through him. Herein is love! Not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins." [219]

   5. There is something yet farther necessary in order to the salvation
   of men. Though by the atonement which Christ has made by his death, a
   way is open for the pardon and salvation of sinners, consistent with
   rectoral righteousness, and- the honour of the divine law; yet man is
   so obstinate in his rebellion, and such an enemy to God, that he cannot
   be persuaded to embrace the gospel; but will dislike and oppose Christ
   and the way of salvation by him, unless his heart be renewed by the
   omnipotent influences of the holy Spirit. Christ has therefore obtained
   by his obedience and sufferings, the holy Spirit to be given unto men
   to recover them from their total depravity, and form their hearts to
   true holiness. This is an infinite gift. It is no less than God giving
   himself to men, in the third person of the adorable Trinity; uniting
   himself to them, and dwelling in them, as the principle and author of
   all their holiness and happiness forever. Did man need no such gift and
   grace, the divine goodness and beneficence in his redemption would be
   unspeakably less, and would not be so gloriously displayed, as now they
   are. In order to redeem man, God not only delivers him from infinite
   wo, and gives him infinite happiness and glory, when man in himself is
   infinitely odious, guilty and ill deserving; but, in order to this,
   gives himself repeatedly, and in different ways. He gave himself to die
   on the cross, a ransom for man, to be a propitiation for their sins.
   The Father gave the Son, and the Son gave himself. He gives himself
   also in the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Ghost, in renewing
   and sanctifying the redeemed, and dwelling in them forever. The
   Mediator said, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of
   truth." [220] And God, in a Trinity of Persons, gives himself to the
   redeemed as their infinite, everlasting portion and happiness. Thus
   divine benevolence is exhausted, and gives all away: Infinite goodness
   can give no more. God gives himself, and all he has for the redemption
   of man! This is, in the highest degree, an "unspeakable gift."

   6. This benevolence and goodness appears greater, and is more
   illustrious in the salvation of man, in that all is given freely,
   without money and without price, as man is infinitely unworthy of it;
   and, as such, receives this redemption as a free gift, the whole being
   offered and given to every one who is willing to receive it. Men obtain
   an interest in this salvation, not by works of righteousness which they
   do; not by any worthiness in them, or by any thing they offer, as the
   price of the divine favour; but by believing in the Mediator, receiving
   the record which God has given concerning his Son, and accepting
   salvation, as it is freely offered and given, trusting wholly in
   Christ, and receiving all from him, as a free gift, to such who are not
   only wholly without any desert of the least favour; but are infinitely
   odious and ill deserving. This is to be saved by faith, by which the
   free grace of God in the salvation of sinners is exercised and
   displayed to the highest degree, as is abundantly represented in divine
   revelation. St. Paul insists much upon this. He having proved from
   scripture that all men are sinners, consequently infinitely ill
   deserving, says, "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no
   flesh be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of
   sin. But now the righteousness of God, without the law, is manifested,
   even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
   all, and upon all them that believe. Being justified freely by his
   grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: Whom God hath
   set forth a propitiation, through faith in his blood. Now to him that
   worketh, (that is, in order to offer his works as the price of God's
   favour,) is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him
   that worketh not, (that is, has nothing to recommend him, and
   acknowledges he has done nothing by which he deserves the divine
   favour, more than any other man,) but believeth on him that justifieth
   the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Therefore it is of
   faith, that it might be by grace." [221] "By grace are ye saved,
   through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."
   [222]

   The above particulars, put together, and taken into one view, serve to
   illustrate the observation, that the redemption of man is the highest
   instance of the exercise of the love of God, in which divine, infinite
   benevolence has an object equal to itself, and is acted out and
   displayed to the highest degree, and best advantage to be seen and
   celebrated by the redeemed and all holy creatures, with increasing
   views and happiness forever and ever. In the redemption of man, the
   infinitely benevolent Jehovah, "fulfils all the good pleasure of his
   goodness, [223] and mercy is built up forever." [224] In this work God
   shows his glory by causing all his goodness to be displayed before the
   redeemed; while his name is proclaimed and celebrated. "The Lord, the
   Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in
   goodness, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
   transgression and sin." [225] This goodness, this love of God, is in
   scripture celebrated as great love. "But God, who is rich in mercy, for
   the great love, wherewith he loved us, &c. Love which passeth
   knowledge." [226] It is called the riches, the exceeding riches of his
   grace. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
   of sins, according to the riches of his grace. And hath raised us up
   together, and made us sit together in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus.
   That in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his
   grace, in his kindness towards us through Jesus Christ." [227]

   The love of God is exercised in the redemption of man in its infinite
   strength, in overcoming difficulties and obstacles infinitely great,
   which were in the way of the exercise of it towards man, and opposed
   it; in delivering from infinite evil, and giving him infinite good.
   This benevolence is infinite mercy and compassion to the infinitely
   miserable. It is exceeding rich, free and sovereign grace, which gives
   such deliverance, such salvation, not only to the undeserving, but
   infinitely guilty, vile and ill deserving.

   IV. This design and work, the redemption of man, has been gradually
   introduced and opened from the first apostasy to the coming of Christ,
   and from that time down to this day; and w ill be carried on until it
   shall be completed, at the end of the world, and the day of judgment.

   Every thing, and all events which took place in the world, from the
   beginning of it, during four thousand years, were preparatory to the
   coming and incarnation of the Redeemer; while other ends, respecting
   redemption, were in view, and answered. And since that event, and the
   resurrection and exaltation of Christ to the throne of his kingdom,
   what has taken place is to be considered as the first fruits of
   redemption, and preparatory to much greater things, which are yet to
   take place in the accomplishment of this great work, which will not be
   completed till the day of judgment. This has been represented by our
   Saviour in a number of similitudes, such as the following. "The kingdom
   of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and
   sowed in his field; which indeed is the least of all seeds; but when it
   is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree: So that
   the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. He spoke
   another parable. The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a
   woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
   leavened." [228] "And he said. So is the kingdom of God, as if a man
   should cast seed into the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and
   day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For
   the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself, first the blade, then the
   ear, after that the full corn in the ear: But when the fruit is brought
   forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is
   come." [229]

   V. The work of redemption is the greatest and most glorious work of
   God, and, indeed, the sum and end of all his works.

   This is abundantly evident from divine revelation; which revelation
   itself originated from this design, and has been formed and given to
   man, in order to promote and accomplish it. It is of no importance or
   worth, any farther than it answers ends which respect the redemption of
   man. This asserts that the new creation, by which is meant the work of
   redemption, or the church of the redeemed, which is the New Jerusalem
   with the inhabitants, is so superior to the old creation, or the
   natural world, and so much the end of it, that the first creation shall
   be swallowed up and forgotten, in the existence and glory of the
   latter. "Behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: And the former
   shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and
   rejoice forever, in that which I create: For behold, I create Jerusalem
   a rejoicing, and her people a joy." [230] This is most expressly
   asserted in the following words. "For by Him were all things created
   that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
   whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers:
   All things were created by Him, and for Him."

   All the created universe, containing every creature and thing, visible
   and invisible, greater and less, are here said to be created for
   Christ, considered as God, Man, and Mediator, the Redeemer of man; for
   in that character and capacity he is considered, described and spoken
   of in these words, and the context, as being "the head of the body, the
   church, who have redemption through his blood." For Him, as the
   Redeemer of the church, and for the sake of the work of redemption; for
   Christ, the Son of God, and his redeemed church, were all things made,
   and to this end they are all subordinated, in the works of creation and
   providence. He is therefore "appointed the heir of all things," [231]
   and made head over all things to the church; all things being put under
   his feet. [232]

   It is hence most certain, that all the works of God have reference to
   the work of redemption, as their end, being all subordinated to this,
   in order to promote and perfect it, and really belong to it, as parts
   and appendages of it. All things are created for the sake of Christ and
   his church, and therefore they are all used and improved for this end
   in the course of divine providence; which consists in ordering and
   disposing all events, and using all things so as completely to answer
   the end for which they were made.

   And that the work of Redemption is the greatest and most glorious of
   all the works of God, and the end of all, will be evident, if we
   consider what it is, and the things which it comprises. To this belong
   the character and works of the Mediator. There could have been no such
   character as this, and no such works as he has done, had there been no
   redemption of man. And his character, and his works, are infinitely
   greater and more glorious than any could have been, had not redemption
   taken place. There is an unspeakably greater and more illustrious
   display of the divine character and perfections in "God manifest in the
   flesh," than could have been in any other way. And to redeem the church
   by giving himself a ransom for it, even his life on the accursed cross;
   to recover man from the power of sin and Satan; to sanctify the church
   and make it a perfectly holy and most beautiful society, is, beyond all
   comparison, a greater work of power, wisdom and goodness, than creating
   and upholding all worlds, or the government of all possible moral
   worlds, exclusive of this. Therefore in this work is the proper and
   full display of the divine perfections, which is the highest end of all
   God's works.

   And by the redemption of the church and the eternal kingdom of Christ,
   the greatest possible happiness of the creation is effected, as an
   eternal monument of the infinite power, wisdom and goodness of God. All
   intelligent creatures who are friends to God, will be, beyond
   expression, more holy and happy, than they could have been, had there
   been no such person and character as that of the Redeemer, and no
   redemption. Though holy angels be not redeemed, yet they behold the
   works of redemption, and the Redeemer with holy love, admiration and
   joy; and see and enjoy unspeakably more of God, than otherwise they
   could have done, and are happy in their activity to promote it. "Into
   this the angels desire to look." [233] "To the intent that now unto
   principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the
   church, the manifold wisdom of God." [234] "Are they not all
   ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs
   of salvation?" [235] By this they have a song to sing which otherwise
   they never could have known. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
   peace, good will to men." [236]

   Thus we have abundant evidence from scripture, and from the reason and
   nature of it, that the work of redemption is not a secondary purpose,
   detached from the original plan of divine operations; but is itself the
   first and original design and end of all the works of God, to which all
   things in creation and providence, in the divine purpose, have respect,
   and are subordinated. "Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation
   of the world, was himself foreordained before the foundation of the
   world." [237] And all the favour, good and happiness bestowed on the
   church, was, by the divine purpose and decree, "given to them, in
   Christ Jesus, before the world began;" [238] they being "chosen in him,
   before the foundation of the world, according to the eternal purpose,
   which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord." [239]

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. We learn, particularly from the third observation, what an ample
   foundation is laid in the work of redemption, for the highest and
   endless gratitude of the redeemed.

   As in the work of redemption is the highest exercise and most perfect
   and glorious display of divine, infinite benevolence, in delivering
   from infinite, deserved evil, and bestowing infinite, undeserved good
   and happiness; by such infinite labour, cost and suffering's of the Son
   of God, the redeemed are laid under infinite and endless obligations;
   suited to excite the highest exercise of that gratitude which consists
   in a proper view, sense and admiration of this benevolence and goodness
   of God, and in feeling and expressing their obligations to him, in
   eternal thanksgiving and praise. And in this a great part of the
   beauty, glory and happiness of the redeemed church will consist. In
   order to raise creatures to the highest happiness, there must not only
   be objects in the best manner suited to excite the exercises of
   benevolent and complacential love; but they must be in circumstances
   suited to call forth the warmest, and most sweet exercises of grateful
   love to him, who by his sovereign goodness has laid them under the
   greatest obligations. The work of redemption is in the highest degree
   suited to this; and the redeemed will be forever immensely more happy
   in the exercise of this sweet happifying love, than any creatures could
   have been had not the redemption of man taken place. This will be the
   sweet, animating subject of the new song which none but the redeemed
   can learn, and which they will sing with increasing delight forever. "O
   give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth
   forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so." [240] They will say so
   forever with unceasing, growing pleasure. In this, in a great measure,
   the happiness of heaven will consist.

   II. We also learn from the fourth particular, and what has been said to
   illustrate it, that they have made a great mistake, who have thought
   that the divine goodness and grace do not appear so great in the pardon
   and salvation of sinners for Christ's sake; it being obtained and
   procured by his suffering in their stead, and hereby making atonement
   for their sins; as it would, had pardon and salvation been granted
   without any such consideration, as that of the atonement and merits of
   Christ.

   It appears from what has been said above, that the salvation of sinners
   by the obedience and sufferings of Christ, is so far from rendering the
   benevolence and grace of God less in saving them, that it enhances and
   magnifies the divine goodness to an amazing degree. Could sinners have
   been saved without such a Mediator, and such atonement as he has made,
   consistent with the honour of divine government, and the greatest good
   of the universe; their pardon and salvation would have required and
   manifested very little benevolence, compared with that which is
   exercised and appears in their salvation, when it could not be effected
   consistent with wisdom and righteousness without the humiliation,
   obedience and sufferings of the Son of God; as has been observed and
   shown above. How contrary to all reason and truth, how very absurd is
   it to assert or suppose, that divine grace in the salvation of men, is
   greatly lessened and obscured by the Son of God suffering the curse in
   their stead, and making atonement for them that they might be delivered
   and saved, consistent with rectitude and wisdom!

   A number of the subjects of a certain king rebelled against him, were
   apprehended, and justly condemned to die for their crime. The
   circumstances of the case were such that they could not be pardoned
   consistent with the proper support of government, and the good of the
   kingdom, unless the king's only son, who was the most honourable and
   excellent person in the kingdom, and whom he loved as himself, should
   willingly take their place, and die in their stead. The son consented
   and chose to do it, in order to obtain pardon for them. The king
   himself made the proposal, and was well pleased with his son's
   readiness to die for them; and freely gave him up to the most
   ignominious and painful death, that he might, consistent with propriety
   and wisdom, pardon those rebels, who deserved themselves to die.

   An equal number of the subjects of another king were condemned to a
   deserved death for rebellion. But the case was such that they might be
   pardoned and restored to favour, consistent with the support of
   government, and the highest good and happiness of his kingdom, without
   any one dying in their stead. He therefore gave them a free and full
   pardon, and restored them to the enjoyment of life and liberty in his
   kingdom.

   Shall it now be asked, Which of these kings exercised and expressed the
   most, the highest degree of benevolence or grace towards the rebels, in
   pardoning and saving them from deserved death? It is presumed no .
   rational creature, who will properly attend to the case, can possibly
   hesitate a moment; but must pronounce the former to have exerted and
   discovered unspeakably more benevolence and goodness, than the latter;
   and that die latter is inconsiderable and as nothing, compared with the
   former.

   How then can any one, in the instance before us, which is in all
   respects infinitely more grand, clear and striking, say or imagine
   there would have been more grace manifested in the pardon and salvation
   of sinners, if this could have taken place, without an atonement by the
   Son of God dying for them, and no such sufferings had been necessary!
   How can any man suppose this without contradicting the reason of man,
   and the clearest dictates and feelings of common sense!

   III. How great is their guilt who slight and oppose the great and
   wonderful works of God in the redemption of man; who neglect this great
   salvation, and abuse this highest and most astonishing instance of the
   goodness of God! All are under this awfully aggravated guilt, who do
   not thankfully embrace this salvation which is freely offered to all.
   And this is the great and chief aggravation of all the sins of men
   under the gospel, that they express or imply a rejection of Jesus
   Christ, who has procured, and offers salvation to them; and a refusal
   to believe on him. Therefore he says, when the Holy Spirit reproves
   mankind of sin, he discovers that it all consists in unbelief, and is
   an expression of that, and because they believe not on him. [241] Every
   sin is a sin of unbelief, as it opposes the Saviour, and is a rejection
   of him, and in this the great and chief criminality of it does consist.
   Had there been no Saviour for man, and no redemption, he would be
   justly punished forever for his sin against God, as his rebellion
   deserved this infinitely great evil. But the sins of man in this case
   would have been as nothing compared with what their sins now are who
   live under the gospel, and oppose, slight and abuse all that
   astonishing benevolence and grace of God and the Redeemer, which is
   exercised and expressed in the work of redemption. The rebellion and
   obstinacy of a creature is aggravated and rendered more criminal by
   every instance and degree of benevolence and kindness exercised towards
   him by his Creator, as every instance of his goodness increases the
   obligation of the creature to love and obey him, and that in proportion
   to the greatness and degree of that goodness. Hence it follows that man
   is laid under the greatest obligations to love and obedience by
   redemption, and the benevolence of God exercised therein; which is by
   far the greatest, and most remarkable and affecting instance of love
   that has been shown to creatures, or of which we can have any
   conception; consequently an obstinate refusal to embrace this
   salvation, and abuse of all this goodness, is the greatest and most
   aggravated crime that men can commit, and swallows up all other
   supposeable crimes, as nothing in comparison with this.

   And this discovers the great and total depravity of man, and the
   exceeding wickedness of the human heart, in that it has so much enmity
   against God and his laws, and is so hard and obstinate, as not to be
   won by such love and kindness; but is disposed to slight God the more
   for all his love, and to abuse and trample upon Christ, and all the
   grace discovered in the gospel. Scripture and experience join to teach
   us that man can do this, and that all have done it, who have had
   opportunity; and that all would persevere in this most aggravated
   wickedness, whatever methods were taken to reclaim them, did not God by
   his immediate, almighty power interpose, and take away the rebellious
   heart, and give a new obedient heart.

   IV. From this subject, and particularly from the foregoing remark, we
   are led to reflect upon the ignorance and insensibility of persons who
   live under the gospel, of their greatest crime and guilt. They in
   general will acknowledge that they are sinners; some are led to this
   acknowledgment from their living and being educated where it is granted
   and inculcated that all men are sinners, and this confession is
   constantly made in public; and where particular practices, of which
   they know they are guilty, are considered and condemned as wrong and
   sinful. Others are convinced in their consciences that they are guilty
   of many actions which are forbidden in the Bible, and that they live in
   the neglect of many duties which are there commanded; and that
   therefore they are criminal. But few have any conviction of the evil
   nature of sin in general; and especially of the greatest sin, and which
   is the chief aggravation of all their sins, viz. their opposition to
   Jesus Christ, and constant abuse of the grace revealed in the gospel.
   Most men who live in gospel light are so far from feeling themselves
   guilty of any crime by not embracing the Saviour, that they have not
   the least idea of this, and stand ready to oppose it, and to exculpate
   themselves, when they are charged with it, and the magnitude of the
   crime is laid before them: And they cannot be brought to a proper
   conviction of their crime and guilt in this, by any arguments and light
   which may be set before them; or by all possible means that may be used
   with them. This leads to another inference.

   V. Hence we see the reason why our great Prophet and Teacher has
   represented it as the work of the Holy Spirit to convince men of this
   sin, and cause them to be thoroughly reproved for it. He says, "And
   when he (the Holy Spirit) is come, he will reprove the world of sin,
   because they believe not on me." [242] Nothing short of the almighty
   agency of the Holy Spirit, renewing the heart, and forming it to true
   discerning in spiritual things, can produce this conviction and
   efficacious reproof. The criminal darkness and delusion which is
   essential to the reign of sin in the heart cannot be removed by any
   agent but the Holy Spirit giving a new heart which admits the true
   light, and sees and confesses the exceeding sinfulness of the human
   heart, this being the fountain and seat of all sin; and especially the
   great sin of all sins, the chief of all crimes, the sin of unbelief, in
   rejecting and abusing Jesus Christ, and the love and grace exhibited in
   him. When men have such an heart given them, they will submit to the
   divine reproof: confess this sin, and feel and own that they are wholly
   without any excuse for not believing on Christ: That in this they have
   been monsters of wickedness, which has been expressed in all the sins
   they have committed; and thus they will humble themselves in the sight
   of God, and fly to the Redeemer for refuge, for pardon and redemption.

CHAP. II.

  CONCERNING THE PERSON AND CHARACTER OF THE REDEEMER.

   WELL may we, with fear and trembling, enter upon this high and
   important subject, the person and character of the Redeemer of men.
   This person is so great and wonderful, that he passes knowledge; and so
   does his character, consequently; which is singular, and infinitely
   distinguished from all others, being excellent and glorious beyond
   conception. And yet there is no salvation for men, without a degree of
   true knowledge of his person and character; and such knowledge is
   connected with eternal life. "This is life eternal, that they might
   know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
   [243]

   He who knows Jesus Christ, the Son of God, knows God. He therefore said
   to one of his disciples, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet
   hast thou not known me? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father."
   [244] The knowledge of Jesus Christ is the sum of all christian
   knowledge, and includes the whole of true divinity. Hence St. Paul says
   to christians at Corinth, "I determined not to know any thing among
   you, save Jesus Christ crucified." [245] And again, "Yea, and I count
   all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
   Jesus my Lord: That I may know him." [246] The apostle Peter exhorts
   christians to strive to make advances, and to increase in the knowledge
   of this person. "Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ." [247] This is an endless theme, an inexhaustible
   subject, which the redeemed will study and explore forever, and will
   grow and increase in the knowledge of this boundless, glorious, and
   most entertaining object, with unspeakable and ever fresh delight and
   joy, without any end. Happy are they who with St. Paul have the true
   revelation of Jesus Christ; it will lead them on, in the only path of
   wisdom, to endless stores of knowledge and happiness; when they shall
   be where he is, and behold his glory: dwelling in the New Jerusalem,
   whereof the Son of God, the Lamb, shall shine forever with increasing
   lustre, and be the light thereof. But they who have not the true
   knowledge of Christ are exposed to run into error and fatal delusions
   respecting this person, and while they profess to acknowledge and
   honour him, really deny and reject him. This was the case with the
   Jews, when the Son of God was in the flesh on earth. "For they that
   dwelt at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor
   yet the voices of the prophets, which were read every Sabbath day, they
   have fulfilled them in condemning him." [248] This proved fatal to
   them, of which our Lord warned them, when he told them, "If ye believe
   not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins." [249] And there soon
   arose in the christian church those who denied the Lord that bought
   them, even our Lord Jesus Christ. [250] And as ignorance of the person
   of Jesus Christ, and mistakes respecting his real character, were so
   dangerous and fatal to Jews and professing christians, in that day,
   they have been equally so in every age since, down to this day; and
   will be as mischievous to us, if we are so criminal and unhappy as to
   imbibe them, or any other, as contrary to the truth.

   Professing christians have differed, perhaps, in nothing so much as
   they have about the person and character of Jesus Christ. The opinions
   which have been imbibed and professed are so many and various, that it
   would take volumes, and be an almost endless task, particularly to
   mention and describe them; which , therefore, will not be undertaken
   here. All that will be attempted, is to ascertain the truth, as
   revealed in the holy scriptures, concerning this high and important
   point, and great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh.

   The variety of different sentiments and gross errors into which men
   have run on this point, to their own destruction, have not been owing
   to any darkness or defect in divine revelation, respecting this. We may
   be certain that the person and character of the Redeemer is there so
   fully, and with so much perspicuity ascertained and fixed, that every
   honest, unprejudiced person, who is willing to know and embrace the
   truth, and will properly study the Bible, will come to the knowledge of
   the truth, and form right conceptions of Jesus Christ, in every
   important article respecting him. All the mistakes and errors,
   therefore, which have been embraced on this point, have originated from
   the evil biases, prejudices, and inattention of sinful man, together
   with the influence which Satan, "who deceives the whole world," has
   been suffered to exert on the minds of men. The depraved minds of men
   love darkness rather than the light; yea, hate the. truth; and are more
   ready to embrace error and delusion, than the pure truth, with relation
   to the Redeemer: And Satan, the great enemy of Christ, and of men, is
   unwearied in his attempts to blind and deceive them, especially
   respecting the Saviour, and lead them to embrace damnable errors
   concerning him, and such as are very dishonourable to him, and rob him
   of all his glory, as the Redeemer of sinners. This will fully account
   for the various and multiplied errors which have been, at one time and
   another, invented and propagated in the christian world, consistent
   with the utmost clearness and perfection of divine revelation on this
   head.

   Ever since the gospel has been preached to the world to this day, the
   person and character of Christ, Christ crucified, has been to the Jews
   a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness: To all the
   unbelieving and disobedient he has been, and is now, and will continue
   to be, "a stone of stumbling and rock of offence." While to them who
   believe he is precious, the only sure foundation, and chief corner
   stone, on whom they build all their hopes. These true friends to Christ
   do know him, having some degree of true acquaintance with his person
   and character: But their knowledge is very imperfect, and, it is to be
   feared, in most, if not all of them, is attended with great darkness,
   and more or less mistakes and wrong conceptions of him. This, however,
   is no matter of discouragement to attend to this subject with great
   care, diligence and circumspection; but rather a weighty motive to it;
   and to attempt to confirm the truth, and throw all the light upon it
   which may have been obtained, by a long and careful study of the holy
   scriptures; leaving it with them who shall come after with more clear
   heads, better hearts, and a more unprejudiced, and engaged study of the
   Bible, to detect the mistakes which may now be made, and remove present
   darkness, by bringing forth more abundant light from the divine
   oracles, on this important subject.

   It is not designed to attempt a particular refutation of any of the
   many different opinions which have been advanced concerning the person
   of the Redeemer, or to answer all the objections which have been made
   to that representation which shall now be given as warranted by the
   scriptures of truth; since stating the truth, and supporting it by
   divine revelation, is the shortest and most effectual way to discover
   and confute the opposite errors, and silence all the objections which
   have been made to it

   The following things appear to be revealed in the holy scriptures,
   concerning this wonderful person; and therefore may be safely believed
   and asserted.

   I. That Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of men, is truly God, or a divine
   person. This has been so much insisted upon, and abundantly proved from
   scripture, by so many writers, that it is needless to attend here to
   all the evidence there is of this truth in scripture. It will be
   sufficient briefly to note the following particulars.

   1. This is expressly asserted of him, and he is often called God in the
   Scripture. The following passages are instances of this. "In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God." This is the Word, which took flesh, or the human nature, into a
   personal union with himself. "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
   among us; and we beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten Son
   of the Father." [251] The Word, which is asserted to be God, is the
   second person in the Trinity. "There are three that bear record in
   heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost." [252] Therefore,
   "his name is called the Word of God." [253] "Unto us a Child is born,
   unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders:
   And his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God."
   [254] "And this is the name whereby he shall be called: The Lord
   (Jehovah) our righteousness." [255] "Behold, a virgin shall be with
   child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name
   Emanuel, which, being interpreted, is God with us." [256] "And Thomas
   answered and said unto him, My Lord, and my God." [257] "Whose are the
   fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over
   all, God blessed forever." [258] "Looking for that blessed hope, and
   glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
   [259] The words in the original might, with propriety, be rendered Our
   Great God and Saviour. Mr. Fleming, in support of this interpretation,
   observes, that we never read of the Father's appearance. [260] "Through
   the righteousness of our God, and Saviour Jesus Christ." [261] "But
   unto the Son, he saith. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever." [262]
   "Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh."
   [263]

   2. What is in one part of the Bible said of Jehovah, and ascribed to
   him, as the only true God, this being the name which is appropriated to
   him in distinction from all other beings, is, in other passages,
   ascribed to the Redeemer of man, Jesus Christ, and applied to him.

   "Mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord (Jehovah) of hosts." [264] This
   Jehovah, Lord of hosts, is said by St. John to be Jesus Christ, as he
   applies this passage to him--"These things, said Isaiah, when he saw
   his (Christ's) glory, and spake of him." [265]

   "Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of
   hosts, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no
   God." [266] Here Jehovah takes this character to himself, as peculiar
   to him. The first, and the last. But Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the
   true Israel, the church; who redeems his people from the curse of the
   law, by his blood, takes this same character to himself, and therefore
   must himself be Jehovah, besides whom there is no God. "I (Jesus
   Christ) am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
   the last." [267] This same person takes this to himself repeatedly in
   the first chapter of this book, "saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the
   first and last." [268] "I am the first and the last: I am he that
   liveth, and was dead, and, behold, I am alive forevermore." [269] "I am
   Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which
   is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." [270] "I, even
   I, am the Lord, and besides me there is no Saviour." [271] This title
   and character, which Jehovah takes to himself, exclusive of all others,
   the Saviour of Israel, his church and people, is constantly given to
   Jesus Christ in the New Testament. He is called Jesus, which signifies
   a Saviour, because he saves his people from their sins. [272] "Christ
   is the head of the church, and he is the Saviour of the body," that is,
   the church. [273] He is called, "our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
   [274] This title is given to him in other places, too many to be
   particularly recited. And this is needless, since one instance of his
   being called, by way of eminence, the Saviour, is sufficient to prove
   the point now in view. It may be proper and useful, however, under this
   head,. to observe, that as this title. The Saviour, is claimed as
   peculiar to Jehovah, the only true God, in the passage just quoted from
   Isaiah; and since Jesus Christ is called God, and asserted to be God,
   in many instances, which have been mentioned above, we are hence
   warranted to apply the expression, God our Saviour, which is so often
   used, to Jesus the only Saviour and Redeemer of his church. Among other
   instances of this, the following may be particularly noted. "And Mary
   said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
   my Saviour. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a
   Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." [275] "According to the commandment
   of God our Saviour, That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour
   in all things. Our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. But after the
   kindness and love of God and our Saviour appeared. [276] Through the
   righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ." [277] In our
   translation it is God and our Saviour, but this is not so agreeable to
   the original, as that now given. "Now unto him that is able to keep you
   from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his
   glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory
   and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever, Amen." [278]

   That Jesus Christ is the person here intended by the only wise God our
   Saviour, is farther evident, because this same thing is expressly
   ascribed to him by St. Paul. "That he (Christ) might present it to
   himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
   thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish." [279]

   Again, Jehovah, the Lord of hosts, is called the husband of the church,
   and claims this relation, "Thy Maker is thine husband, the Lord of
   hosts is his name." [280] "Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken, &c.
   for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married--And as
   the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
   thee." [281] This same character and relation is ascribed to Jesus
   Christ. He is the bridegroom, the husband of the church. John Baptist,
   speaking of Christ, says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom."
   [282] St. Paul says to the Corinthian church, "I have espoused you to
   one husband, that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ." [283]
   St. John heard them rejoicing in heaven, and saying, "The marriage of
   the Lamb is come, and his wife (the church) hath made herself ready."
   [284] "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, (which is the church)
   coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her
   husband. And there came unto me one of the seven angels, and talked
   with me, saying, come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's
   wife." [285] Thus it appears that Jehovah, the only true God, is the
   church's husband; and so is Jesus Christ. Therefore Jesus Christ is
   Jehovah; or the only true God, and Jesus Christ, are the same: For the
   church hath not, and cannot have two husbands: Nor are there two brides
   or wives, who can each of them have a husband: For there is but one
   church; but one bride, who, as a chaste virgin, is espoused to one
   husband, Jesus Christ. "There is one body," that is, the church, of
   which Christ is the only head and husband. [286] "My dove, my
   undefiled, is but one." [287]

   "Sanctify the Lord (Jehovah) of hosts himself, and let him be your
   fear, and let him be your dread: And he shall be for a sanctuary; but
   for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses
   of Israel." [288] This, which is spoken of Jehovah, is applied to Jesus
   Christ by St. Peter. "The stone which the builders disallowed, the same
   is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling and rock of
   offence." [289] It is said, "The Lord God of the holy prophets sent his
   angel to shew unto his servants the things which shortly must be done."
   [290] And in the sixteenth verse Jesus Christ says, "I Jesus have sent
   mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches." Here the
   Lord God of the holy prophets, which must be Jehovah, and Jesus Christ,
   are said to be the same thing. Therefore Jesus Christ and the Lord God,
   are one and the same.

   Not half the instances of this kind, which might be adduced under this
   head, have been mentioned; but these are enough, it is presumed, to
   illustrate and make evident to every attentive, impartial person, the
   truth of the particular observation, to prove which they have been
   cited.

   3. That Jesus Christ is God, is evident from the divine attributes
   being ascribed to him, even those which are peculiar to the Deity.

   Eternity, or existing without beginning, is ascribed to him. "But thou,
   Bethlehem--out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler
   of Israel, whose goings forth have been from old, from everlasting."
   [291] This is expressly applied to Christ. [292] He is represented in
   that remarkable type of him, Melchisedec, to be without beginning of
   days, or end of time. [293] He is "the beginning and the ending, the
   first and the last, which is, and which was, and which is to come."
   [294] Which words strongly express eternal existence, without beginning
   or end.

   Immutability is ascribed to him, which is an attribute peculiar to God.
   Speaking to the Son of God, it is said, "Thou art the same," as opposed
   to all changeable existence. [295] This is expressed more strongly in
   the following words, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and
   forever." [296] Here both his eternity, his existence from everlasting
   to everlasting, and his immutability are expressed.

   He is omnipotent. "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All
   power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth:" [297] He is "head over
   all things to the church. " [298] He is "able to subdue all things unto
   himself." [299] He is "the first and the last, which is, and which was,
   and which is to come, the Almighty." [300] "He upholds all things, by
   the word of his power." [301] His creating and upholding all things,
   and other works which are ascribed to him, are, without controversy,
   the work of Omnipotence. But these will be more particularly considered
   under another head.

   That he is Omnipresent, he himself declared, "Where two or three are
   gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." "And
   lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." [302] "And no
   man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even
   the Son of man which is in heaven." [303] Surely these things cannot be
   said with truth of any one but Him, whose presence fills heaven and
   earth. Omniscience is also one of his attributes. This Peter ascribes
   to him, without reserve, and with the greatest confidence. "And Peter
   said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things." [304] It is asserted,
   agreeable to this, that "He knew all men, and knew what was in man."
   [305] And it is often said that he knew the secret thoughts of men. And
   he says, "And all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth
   the reins and hearts, and will give unto every one of you according to
   his works." [306] This is elsewhere spoken of as the attribute and
   prerogative of the omniscient God alone. Solomon, speaking to Jehovah,
   says, "Thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men." [307] "The
   righteous God trieth the hearts and reins." [308] "I, the Lord, search
   the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his
   ways." [309] If Jesus Christ were not the only true God, it is
   impossible he should take to himself this attribute, prerogative and
   work, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, claims to himself exclusively;
   and which is infinitely too much to be ascribed to any mere creature.
   Jesus Christ is declared to be incomprehensible, which is an attribute
   peculiar to Deity. He says of himself, "All things are delivered unto
   me of my Father; and no man (no one, it is in the original) knoweth the
   Son but the Father." [310] And it is said of him, "He had a name
   written that no man (no one) knew but he himself." [311] Equality with
   God is ascribed unto him. St. Paul, speaking of his person, says, "Who
   being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God."
   [312] Jesus said to the Jews, "I and my Father are one." [313] The Jews
   understood him as hereby claiming to be God, and charged him with
   making himself God. [314] Nor does Christ, in his answer to them,
   renounce this claim. Jesus said, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I
   work." [315] Upon this the Jews charged him with making himself equal
   with God. Nor does he deny this charge, or say that it is unjust: but
   goes on to say, in a yet stronger manner, "What things soever the
   Father doeth, those also doth the Son likewise. For as the Father
   raiseth up the death, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth
   whom he will. For the Father hath committed all judgment unto the Son;
   that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father."
   Surely this is making himself equal with God. He moreover says, "All
   things that the Father hath, are mine." [316] Thus he claims to be
   equal with the Father, the owner and possessor of all things. This is
   consistent with his saying, "The Father is greater than I," as he was
   man as well as God, and agreeable to the economy of redemption, in the
   human nature, was become a servant, to obey and suffer, in order to
   effect the redemption of man. In this capacity and work he was sent,
   and to be justified and exalted by the Father. In this view his words
   have a plain meaning, consistent with his claim of equality with the
   Father, as God. "If ye had loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said,
   I go unto the Father; for my Father is greater than I." [317]

   4. The divinity of Jesus Christ is asserted by ascribing to him those
   divine works which God alone can do.

   He puts himself upon an equality with the Father in this respect, and
   says, that he does whatsoever the Father doth. "My Father worketh
   hitherto, and I work. What things soever he doth, those also doth the
   Son likewise." [318] The works of creation and providence are ascribed
   to him. "All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing
   made that was made." [319] "For by him were all things created that are
   in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they
   be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were
   created by him, and for him." [320] God hath made all things for
   himself: All things were made by Jesus Christ, and for him; Therefore
   he is God. "And he is before all things, and by him all things
   consist." [321] "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express
   image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
   when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of
   the Majesty on high." [322] And he is addressed in the following words,
   "Thou, Lord, in the beginning, hast laid the foundation of the earth;
   and the heavens are the works of thine hands." [323] Bat these are the
   works of God, of Jehovah, and peculiar to him. "In the beginning God
   created the heaven and the earth. By the word of the Lord were the
   heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth."
   [324]

   Jesus Christ raiseth men from the dead, which is a work of omnipotence
   as great as that of creation. When he was on earth he raised man from
   the dead, by his own powerful word. And he claims power and authority
   to raise all the dead of mankind, at the last day. He hath said, "The
   hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the
   voice of the Son of God, and shall come forth, they that have done
   good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto
   the resurrection of damnation. And this is the will of him that sent
   me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
   everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. I am the
   resurrection and the life." [325]

   Jesus Christ will judge the world, angels, devils, and all mankind.
   This is often asserted in the scripture. All judgment is committed unto
   him. A work infinitely too great for a mere creature to perform; and
   therefore infinitely too great for him, and too high and honourable,
   were he not the most high God, possessed of infinite power, knowledge,
   wisdom and rectitude.

   But one thing more will be added under this head. Jesus Christ is
   Governor of the world. He has all things in his hand; upholds all
   things by the word of his power; is head over all things to the church,
   having all power in heaven and on earth. He executeth a particular
   providence; his care and power orders and effects every event, and
   extends to every creature and thing in the created universe, whether
   great or small. He alone, therefore, is able to take the book of the
   divine decrees, and open the seals thereof, by governing the world, and
   bringing to pass all things agreeable to the eternal purpose. None can
   do this but he who has omnipotence, infinite knowledge, wisdom and
   goodness.

   5. It is certain that Jesus Christ is the supreme God, in that he is
   the object of the divine worship, which would be idolatry, if offered
   to any being but the only true God.

   Nothing can be more evident and certain than that God is the only
   proper object of religious worship. Jesus Christ is, in the holy
   scriptures, asserted to be the object of such worship; therefore he is
   God.

   All the angels of heaven are commanded to worship him. "When he
   bringeth the first begotten into the world, he saith. And let all the
   angels of God worship him." [326] John saw and heard him worshipped in
   heaven, and represented as the object of prayer and praise. "And when
   he had taken the book, the four beasts, and the four and twenty elders,
   fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden
   vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a
   new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the seals
   thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, by thy
   blood. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
   the throne, and the beasts and the elders; and the number of them was
   ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands: saying,
   with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power,
   and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
   blessing. And every creature heard I saying. Blessing, and honour, and
   glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
   the Lamb, forever and ever. And the Tour beasts said» Amen. And the
   four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth forever
   and ever;" even Jesus Christ, who was dead, and is alive, and behold,
   he liveth forever and ever. [327] Thus all in heaven and on earth
   "honour the Lamb, the Son, even as they honour the Father." [328]

   Agreeable to this, St. Paul says of Jesus Christ, "God hath highly
   exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at
   the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of things in heaven and
   things in earth, and under the earth; (or angels, and men, both the
   living and the dead) and that every tongue should confess that Jesus
   Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." [329]

   These words express the involuntary subjection of his enemies, and the
   voluntary submission, adoration, and worship of his friends, which is
   given only to God. And that such subjection, submission and worship, is
   here intended, which is due to God alone; and that Jesus Christ is this
   God, is evident both from this same apostle's quotation of these words
   in another place, and from the passage in the prophet Isaiah, from,
   whence they are taken. "For we shall all stand before the judgment seat
   of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee
   shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God." [330] This
   homage is here said to be paid to Jesus Christ, as Judge of the world,
   and as God. And this bowing the knee and confession, is claimed by
   Jehovah, the God of Israel, and he says it shall be given to him, as
   the only true God, in the passage quoted from Isaiah, "I am God, and
   there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my
   mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee
   shall bow, and every tongue shall swear." [331]

   Stephen, the first martyr, prayed to Jesus Christ, and committed his
   spirit, himself, to him, when he was expiring under the hand of his
   persecutors. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying.
   Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. [332] The word God is not in the
   original, and the words might be with propriety rendered, calling upon
   Jesus Christ, saying, Lord Jesus, &c. Such a solemn prayer to Jesus
   Christ, putting his whole trust in him, and committing his soul to him,
   with his last breath, is an act of worship, which would be gross
   idolatry, if offered to any but God.

   And as Stephen worshipped Jesus Christ, and called upon his name,
   making his last prayer to him when he was leaving the world, he was not
   singular and alone in this; but thus calling on the name of Christ was
   practised by all christians, and therefore mentioned as expressive of
   their character, and an essential branch of it, and by which they are
   denominated, and distinguished from others. St. Paul thus addresses
   them: "Unto the church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are
   sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every
   place call upon the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, both theirs and
   ours." [333] Ananias, speaking to the Lord Jesus Christ, says, "And
   here he (Saul) hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that
   call on thy name." [334] That is, all christians. And of Saul it is
   further said, "And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues,
   that he is the Son of God. But all that heard him were amazed, and
   said, Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in
   Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them
   bound unto the chief priests." [335]

   And when he was on earth he was worshipped--By the wise men from the
   east--By a ruler of the synagogue--By a woman of Canaan--By a leper--By
   a man born blind, whom he had restored to sight--By all who were in the
   ship with him--By the women, when they saw him, after his
   resurrection--By the multitude of his disciples, when he appeared to
   them in Galilee; and by his disciples who saw him ascend from Mount
   Olivet into heaven. Yet in none of these instances did he forbid this
   worship to be paid to him, or shew the least disapprobation of it; but
   the history of it leads us to suppose that such worship was proper; and
   that he accepted it with approbation, and was pleased with it: Whereas,
   when Cornelius the centurion, offered to worship Peter, he forbid and
   reproved him, saying, "Stand up, I myself also am a man." [336] And
   when St. John offered to worship the Angel who spake to him, he
   received a rebuke from him. He said unto him, "See thou do it not; for
   I am thy fellow servant. Worship God." [337] Plainly declaring that God
   only is the proper object of such worship; which worship was paid to
   Jesus Christ, with his approbation, as has been observed; which he must
   have rejected, and rebuked those who offered it, as Peter and the Angel
   did, had he not been a divine person, that is, God. He himself rebuked
   the devil when he proposed to Christ to worship him; not because he was
   an evil being; but because he was not God, and such worship was to be
   given to God only. "Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan;
   for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
   shalt thou serve." [338] The word in the original translated serve, is
   found in above twenty places in the New Testament, and always means
   religious service, implying devotion and religious worship, and is in a
   number of places translated to worship.

   The disciples of Christ and the christian church, by thus worshipping
   him as their Lord, and their God, obeyed the prophetic direction and
   command given in the 45th psalm. "So shall the king greatly desire thy
   beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him."

   Jehovah had abundantly expressed his peculiar displeasure with
   idolatry, and done much to guard his people, and warn them against it,
   and all approaches to it: and did often strictly forbid their
   worshipping any creature, idols, or any god besides himself. And he had
   often punished them for this sin, as peculiarly provoking to him. He
   had said, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me: thou shalt not bow
   down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a
   jealous God. Thou shalt worship no other god; for I the Lord, whose
   name is Jealous, am a jealous God. I am the Lord, that is my name, and
   my glory I will not give unto another, neither my praise to graven
   images." If Jesus Christ were not God, even this same God, who has said
   these things, what a contradiction to these declarations and commands,
   and how inconsistent is it with them to set him so high, as worthy of
   equal honour with the Father; to call him God, and give him all the
   power in heaven and earth, and make him head over all things to the
   church; to represent him as praised, adored, and worshipped, by all the
   inhabitants in heaven; and to command all the angels in heaven, and the
   church in earth, to worship him! Were he not the true God, this would
   be the greatest imaginable, and even an irresistible temptation and
   encouragement to the most gross idolatry; to worship and trust in him
   who is not God, but a mere creature. We cannot reconcile the Old
   Testament with the New, or the New Testament with itself, unless we
   believe and grant, that Jesus Christ is the true God; for in both, men
   are repeatedly forbidden to worship, or pay religious homage to any but
   the only true God: And yet in both, they are commanded to worship Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God, the King of Israel. And the latter teaches us
   that he who of old was worshipped by the Seraphim under the name and
   character of Jehovah, the Lord of hosts, was Jesus Christ. [339] But if
   Jesus Christ be the true Son of God; God with us; God manifest in the
   flesh, as he is expressly declared to be, all the Bible can be
   reconciled with itself, and appears perfectly consistent, on this head:
   While we there behold him who was in the form of God, and thought it
   not robbery to be equal with God; who appeared and acted from the
   beginning of the world, and under the Old Testament dispensation, in
   the form of God, who took to himself the name Jehovah, and the
   attributes and character of the most high God, and claimed the worship
   and honours which belong to God alone: While we behold him laying aside
   his former appearance and glory, and making himself of no reputation;
   taking upon himself the form of a servant, instead of the form of God,
   in which he appeared before; being made in the likeness of man: In this
   view, we shall see the whole scripture to harmonize on this point, and
   be constrained to say with Thomas, "My Lord, and my God!" and join to
   honour him, even as the Father is honoured; ascribing, with the
   heavenly hosts, praise, blessing, wisdom, power, dominion and glory,
   unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, forever and
   ever.

   And, indeed, if he be not the true God, and to be worshipped as God,
   who has created all things that ever were created; and upholds them all
   continually by his powerful word; who has all the power in the
   universe, and sustains and governs all creatures and things, being head
   over all things to the church; it will be impossible to find any proper
   object of worship, or any God to be trusted and adored.

   It may be further added, that the religious rite of baptism, instituted
   by Christ, is a solemn and important act of devotion and worship, in
   which the name of God is invoked, and the person baptized is dedicated
   to him with awful solemnity. This religious act of worship is commanded
   to be done in the name of Christ, in which he joined with the Father
   and the Holy Ghost. "Go teach all nations, said Christ to his
   disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost." [340] This, properly considered, will appear a
   demonstration of the divinity of the Son of God, and that he is equally
   God with the Father; and cannot be accounted for on any other
   supposition. If Jesus Christ were not God, what a profanation of the
   sacred name would this be, and what a gross act of idolatry, to join
   his name with that of the only true God, as equal with him in such a
   solemn act of covenanting, and religious worship!

   The priests in Israel, Aaron and his sons, were appointed and directed
   to bless, in the name of the Lord, and to say, "The Lord bless thee,
   and keep thee: The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be
   gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and
   give thee peace." This was an act of solemn, religious worship,
   invoking the name of Jehovah, and calling on him. [341] St. Paul
   blesses christians, in the name of the same Lord, doubtless, even in
   the name into which they were baptized, saying, "The grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost,
   be with you all, Amen." [342] This is an act of devotion and worship,
   in which God is called upon to bless; or he asks this blessing from
   God. If Jesus Christ were not God, thus to bless in his name, and join
   him with the true God in this invocation, and act of worship, would be
   real idolatry. And it is remarkable that as the name Jehovah, or Lord,
   is mentioned distinctly three times, in the blessing which Aaron and
   his sons were ordered to pronounce, denoting, as is reasonably
   supposed, the three, included in that name; so the apostle, blessing in
   the same name, mentions three, as included in this name, each of which
   is elsewhere expressly called God, and Lord. And it is worthy of
   observation here, that as the baptism which Christ ordered to be
   administered in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is
   afterwards said to be administered in the name of the Lord, and in the
   name of Jesus Christ because one of these supposes and comprehends all;
   so this apostle, who blessed in the name of these same three, does more
   commonly bless in the name of Jesus Christ. "The grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, be with you;" because he is God, and the whole Trinity is
   implied in his name: And this is to bless in the name of the adorable
   three, as really as when they are distinctly mentioned.

   Much more may be produced from the holy scriptures to prove and confirm
   this truth, that Jesus Christ is God; but surely what his been now
   collected from the sacred oracles on this head, is sufficient to
   establish this important doctrine in the mind of every honest,
   unprejudiced person, who is willing properly to attend to it, and to
   know the truth.

   There have been, and now are, indeed, many professing christians, who
   do not believe; but deny and oppose this doctrine of the divinity of
   Jesus Christ. These appear to be led to renounce this doctrine,
   principally for two reasons. First, because they are disposed to reject
   every doctrine in Christianity, which they cannot comprehend, and fully
   understand, with their boasted reason. They therefore deny the doctrine
   of the Trinity, as well as this of the divinity of Christ, and many
   other doctrines, which to them are incomprehensible, and which they
   therefore pronounce unreasonable. And would they be consistent, they
   must renounce Christianity itself, and even the belief of the being of
   a God, and of almost every thing else; for the existence of God is as
   incomprehensible as the divinity of Christ: And it is above our reason
   or conception, and contrary to reason as some would improve it, that
   any being should exist without any cause out of himself; and without
   beginning to exist; and unchangeable, &c. If the being of a God be
   admitted, which must be admitted, unless we renounce all reason, we
   must admit innumerable mysteries, which our minds cannot fathom and
   comprehend.

   And what object is there in universal nature, which can be fully
   comprehended by us? And what truth is there which respects God or the
   creature, which can be perfectly understood by us, and which is not
   attended with seeming contradictions; at least, in the view of some?

   Secondly, Another reason of their rejecting the doctrine of the
   divinity of Christ, is, their not seeing any need of his being God, in
   order to be the Saviour of men. They entertain such notions of God, the
   divine law and government, of the nature and demerit of sin, the state
   of fallen man, &c. that they cannot see any need of atonement for sin,
   which a creature cannot make, or of any thing to be done by the
   Redeemer of man, which a mere creature cannot do. Therefore they are
   resolved not to admit a doctrine which in their view is so
   incomprehensible and absurd, and at the same time so perfectly useless.
   They therefore think they find many things in divine revelation
   inconsistent with this doctrine; and have attempted to explain away
   those passages of scripture adduced to support it, and to put such a
   sense upon them as to make them assert no such thing. Their objections,
   and manner of explaining the scriptures, so as to make them consistent
   with their believing Jesus Christ to be a mere creature, will not be
   particularly considered here; as this has been done by many able
   divines. What has been now produced from the scriptures, to prove that
   Jesus Christ is the true God, it is presumed, is sufficient to satisfy
   every humble, modest inquirer after the truth, that this doctrine is
   clearly revealed in the Bible; and in such a manner, that the evidence
   of it is incontestible, and must be admitted, if we admit the
   scriptures to be the standard of truth. And this evidence will rise
   higher, if possible, as we proceed, and when we come to consider the
   importance and necessity of this doctrine; and that none but a divine
   person could be the Redeemer of man, consistent with other doctrines
   and truths of divine revelation; and do and suffer what was necessary
   to be done and suffered, in order to redeem sinners: That a person who
   is not God, would be infinitely unequal to this work.

   But there is another truth equally important, and plainly revealed,
   with that which we have been considering, concerning this wonderful
   person.

   II. The Redeemer of sinners is truly and really man. This person is
   both God and man. The Word, who was God, and created all things that
   are made, became, and was made flesh, and dwelt among men. He was made
   in the likeness of men, and was found in fashion as a man, that is, was
   really man, "the son of man." He is therefore denominated man, that
   man, the man Christ Jesus, &c. This necessarily implies that he had a
   real body and soul; for these are essential to human nature; so that
   none can be a real man, who has not both these. The history of his
   conception, birth, life, death and resurrection, states this truth in a
   clear and unequivocal light. Therefore there is need of nothing farther
   to be said, to prove that Jesus Christ is really man. But it seems
   needful to observe and attend to the following things concerning this
   wonderful, incomprehensible person, God man, and the union of these two
   natures, in this one person.

   1. The human nature of Jesus Christ is not a distinct person, separate
   from the divine nature, or his Godhead. The human nature exists, and
   began to exist, in union with the sacred person in the Trinity, the
   Word; so that both natures are but one person. As the soul and body of
   a man, though different and distinct in their nature; or are two
   different natures, considered in themselves; yet in union with each
   other, are but one person.

   2. What is true and may be affirmed of either nature, divine and human,
   is true, and may be affirmed of this person, Jesus Christ, the
   Redeemer. This same person is God, and he is man. This person was in
   heaven, and was visible on earth at the same time. "No man hath
   ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
   of man which is in heaven." [343] This person who is God-man, Immanuel,
   God with us, God manifest in the flesh, was put to death in the flesh,
   that is, in the human nature. He died on the cross, and his blood was
   poured out there. This being the death, the blood of this person, it
   was the blood of God, because this person was God. [344] This person is
   omniscient and unchangeable in his divine nature; but the human nature
   of this person is not omniscient, nor unchangeable, but did increase in
   stature, knowledge and wisdom. [345] As God, he is omnipotent and
   independent; as man, he is altogether dependent. Many other instances
   of this kind might be mentioned; but these are sufficient to illustrate
   the observation which has now been mentioned concerning this wonderful,
   complex person, including two natures perfectly distinct, and
   infinitely different one from the other.

   This matter may be farther explained, and rendered more intelligible,
   perhaps, by considering the person of a man. Every man is a complex
   person, consisting of body and soul, of very distinct and different
   natures, and yet so united, as to make one person. What is true of one
   of these two parts or natures of man, is not true of both. The body is
   mortal, the soul is not. The body has dimensions, and visible shape and
   countenance; the soul has nothing of these, and is not capable of them.
   And yet, what is true of either of these different parts or natures, is
   true of the person consisting of these parts. The same person is
   mortal, as to his body; but is immortal, as to his mind. The person
   dies, but it is only in one of the constituent parts of his person, his
   body. Therefore this same person may live, when his body is dead. This
   person, consisting of body and soul, is intelligent, does think and
   reason. This is true of the person, because his mind is intelligent,
   thinks and reasons; while his body is not capable of this, &c. &c.

   3. These two distinct and infinitely different natures, united in the
   person of Jesus Christ, are not transformed into each other, so that
   one becomes the other by this personal union; but remain as distinct
   and different, in this respect, as if there were no such personal
   union. The human nature is not God, and has not any of the attributes
   peculiar to divinity, any more than if it were not united to divinity.
   And the divine nature of Christ is no more a creature, and has no more
   the peculiar properties of a man, than if no such personal union of
   these natures had taken place. Therefore,

   4. This personal union of the divine nature, or of God in the second
   person of the Godhead, with the human nature, does not cause or suppose
   any change in the former: But as God, this person is unchangeable. The
   human nature is assumed, or taken into a personal union with the second
   person of the Trinity, without any change in the divinity or divine
   nature; And all the change, or that is changeable, is in the human
   nature.

   5. The personality of Jesus Christ is in his divine nature, and not in
   the human. Jesus Christ existed a distinct divine person from eternity,
   the second person in the adorable Trinity. The human nature which this
   divine person, the Word, assumed into a personal union with himself, is
   not, and never was, a distinct person by itself; and personality cannot
   be ascribed to it, and does not belong to it, any otherwise than as
   united to the Logos, the Word of God. The Word assumed the human
   nature, not a human person, into a personal union with himself, by
   which this complex person exists, God-man. Had the second person in the
   Trinity taken a human person into union with himself, and were this
   possible, Jesus Christ, God and man, would be two persons, not one.
   Hence, when Jesus Christ is spoken of as being a man, "the son of man,
   the man Christ Jesus, &c."--these terms do not express the personality
   of the manhood, or of the human nature of Jesus Christ; but these
   personal terms are used with respect to the human nature, as united to
   a divine person, and not as a mere man. For the personal terms, He, I,
   and Thou, cannot, with propriety, or truth, be used by, or of the human
   nature, considered as distinct from the divine nature of Jesus Christ.

   6. The mode or manner of the union of the two natures, divine and
   human, in one person, cannot be described nor conceived by us, it being
   entirely above our comprehension. This does not, however, render it in
   the least degree incredible. For could it be comprehended, it would not
   be a real union, much less a union of the divine nature with the human.
   For if we cannot comprehend, or have any clear conception of the
   personal union of our own souls with our bodies; how much more
   inconceivable must this high and singular union be to us, by which
   Deity and humanity are united, and become one person!

   7. The human nature of Jesus Christ is doubtless unspeakably greater
   and more excellent than any other creature. This individual of the
   human race, being raised up to a personal union with him who is God, is
   the first and chief of all elect creatures, the greatest and most
   peculiar favourite; and is under the greatest advantages to advance in
   knowledge and holiness, being brought nearest to God of any creature,
   and receiving peculiar and more copious communications from him. It is
   with respect to his human nature, that John the Baptist speaks, when he
   says of Jesus Christ, "God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him."
   [346] As Jesus Christ increased in wisdom, in knowledge, and holiness,
   in the human nature, when in this world; so he will doubtless increase
   in this, and in degrees of existence without end; and make more rapid
   advances than any mere creature in proportion to the greater favours,
   and the special advantages enjoyed in the near and peculiar union to
   the Deity, and the high and important station and offices to which the
   human nature is advanced. May we not from this, and other
   considerations which might be mentioned, safely conclude, that the
   human nature of Jesus Christ, is greater in capacity, in knowledge and
   holiness, and has, or will have, without end, more or a greater degree
   of existence, worth and happiness, not only than any mere creature, but
   more and greater than the whole redeemed church, and even all the elect
   angels, were the latter summed up together? The former, when put in the
   balance, may exceed it, to a degree beyond all our present conceptions.

   8. The human nature of Jesus Christ began to exist when it was
   conceived in the virgin Mary, and not before. The scripture history of
   his conception and birth, or the incarnation, and all that is said of
   it, naturally leads to this conclusion. The reader will have no other
   idea suggested to his mind, unless he has some particular end to answer
   by rejecting it; or puts a sense on some other passages of scripture,
   which is inconsistent with it. Such there have been in former ages, and
   such there are now in the christian world, who are confident that the
   soul, or rational creature, which was united to a body in the
   incarnation, did not then begin to exist, but is the first creature
   that was made, &c. And they have thought that this sentiment is
   supported by a number of passages in the Bible. But the writers who
   have opposed them in this, it is thought, have made it evident that the
   passages which they allege assert no such thing; but are perfectly
   consistent with the human nature of Jesus Christ beginning to exist at
   his incarnation.

   The doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul of Jesus Christ, or of
   that created nature which took a body in the womb of the virgin Mary,
   appears first to be invented and propagated by Arius, in the fourth
   century, and, since his time, by his followers. He denied the divinity
   of Jesus Christ, or that he is the true God equal with the Father; and
   asserted that he is a mere creature. And in order to support his notion
   of the Redeemer, and make it consistent with many passages of scripture
   which represent him as existing before his incarnation, and from the
   beginning, and speak of his creating the world, &c. which his opposers
   used, to prove that he is a divine person, or the true God, he invented
   this scheme, and applied them to this pre-existing creature.

   This creature, they suppose, was the first creature that was made, and
   the greatest and most exalted of all creatures, and in this sense is
   "the first born of every creature; and the beginning of the creation of
   God." That he made the world, and had the government of it, at least in
   some degree, before his incarnation. That he is the Logos, or the Word,
   which became flesh, and dwelt among men, by taking a body in the womb
   of the virgin Mary, and being born of her. Thus this glorious creature,
   who was greater and more honourable than the angels, and placed far
   above them, in the highest and most dignified station, and made in a
   sense, a God, and appeared in the form of God, being nevertheless, but
   a mere creature, made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the
   form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, &c.

   There are others, especially of late, who, though they profess to
   believe that Jesus Christ is God, in a sense in which the Arians deny
   it; and that the human nature has a personal union with Deity; yet hold
   with the Arians, that the created nature of the Redeemer, his body
   excepted, existed before his incarnation, and was the first creature
   that was created, &c. They think this to be asserted in several places
   of scripture; and that many others cannot be well explained on any
   other supposition. It has been observed, that the divines who have
   opposed this scheme, have shewn that all these passages of scripture
   which have been adduced in favour of it, import no such thing; but are
   perfectly consistent with the human nature of Christ beginning to exist
   at his incarnation. The labour of repeating what has been written to
   this purpose, will not now be undertaken, as it may be found in most
   commentators on the Bible, and in their writings who have opposed the
   Arian scheme. It may be proper, however, to take notice of two
   expressions in scripture, which the favourers of this notion have
   thought to be most express in their favour. Jesus Christ says of
   himself that he is, "The beginning of the creation of God." [347] That
   is, say they, the first creature that was created by God. But these
   words do not, by the most natural construction, express any such idea.
   If he existed before the creation of any thing, and did himself begin
   and finish the creation of God; and is the head and Lord of the
   creation, and head over all things to the church, all which we have
   seen the scripture affirm of him; what words could more clearly, and in
   the most concise manner, express all this than these, "The beginning of
   the creation of God?" Jesus Christ says of himself repeatedly, in this
   book of the revelation, "I am the beginning and the end, the first and
   the last." By which, is not meant that he began to exist, or was
   created the first of all; but directly the contrary, viz. that he
   existed without beginning, and without end, and is the author, the
   creator, or beginner of all things. [348] Jesus Christ is called, "The
   first born of every creature," or, as it might be more properly
   rendered. The first born of the whole creation. [349] This, they plead,
   imports that he is the first creature that was made. But the scripture
   no where expresses creation by being born: nor is this the natural
   import of the word. Therefore, these words do not appear to suggest
   that the Son of God, of whom the apostle is speaking, was created the
   first of all creatures. There is a more natural and easy sense,
   consistent with the human nature of Christ beginning to exist at his
   incarnation. The first born had the preeminence in the family, and was
   in a peculiar sense the heir. In ancient times, the first born was much
   distinguished from the rest of the family. He was of course, after his
   father, the ruler, the king, and priest in the family. Agreeable to
   this, Jacob addresses his first born son in the following words;
   "Reuben, thou art my first born, my might, and the beginning of my
   strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power."
   [350] The first born was, in a peculiar sense, the heir; and by his
   birth had a right to the blessing, and a double portion. Thus Esau,
   being the first born of Isaac, was heir to the blessing of his father,
   and to pre-eminence in all respects, as his birth right. In Israel, the
   first born were in a peculiar sense appropriated to God, and heirs of a
   double honour and portion, the peculiar favourites. These, in the
   family of Aaron, were heirs to the high priesthood; and the first born
   of the kings were heirs of the kingdom. With reference to this, the
   redeemed are called, "the church of the first born," [351] God says to
   Pharaoh, "Israel is my son, even my first born." [352] And he says, "I
   am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first born--My dear son, a
   pleasant child." [353] In these passages first born has no reference to
   priority of existence; but to pre-eminence, and their being subjects of
   peculiar favours, honours, and privileges. In this sense, it is
   predicted of Christ, "I will make him my first born, higher than the
   kings of the earth." [354] When all this is considered, who can be at a
   loss about the meaning of the expression before us? "The first born of
   the whole creation." He is the highest, most honourable, the peculiar
   favourite, the king, the head and the heir of the whole creation; in
   all things having the pre-eminence above every other creature; for all
   things were created for him. [355] The apostle fully explains himself
   in these and the following words, "And he is the head of the body, the
   church, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead; that in all
   things he might have the pre-eminence." In this sense, "he is the first
   born among many brethren." [356] But if we understand his being the
   first born of every creature, as expressing his priority of existence
   to the whole creation, it must be understood not of his human, but of
   his divine nature; for this person exists before all, worlds, and
   without beginning, as has been proved. Agreeable to this, the apostle
   goes on to say, [357] "And he is before all things, and by him all
   things consist." This is true of this person, but cannot be true of the
   human nature, that it exists before all things, that is, all created
   things.

   But it may be farther observed, that it is not only consistent with the
   whole of divine revelation, to consider the human nature of the
   Redeemer, as beginning to exist at his incarnation; and not only that
   no important or good end is answered by the contrary supposition: But
   it appears to be contrary to the current of scripture, and of a
   dangerous and bad tendency. For,

   First. This notion appears inconsistent with the true and real manhood
   of Jesus Christ, or with his taking upon him the human nature, and
   being a real man, which the scripture abundantly asserts, as we have
   seen» If the creature w4iich took a body by the incarnation were the
   first and greatest creature that was ever created, he was no more a
   man, no more like and akin to the human race, or the nature of man,
   than the angels; but was more distant from man than they, as he was
   much greater and higher than they. But if an angel should take upon him
   a real human body, this would not make him a man, or one of the human
   race. Gabriel, indeed, who was sent from heaven to Daniel, is called
   "The man Gabriel;" and the angels which appeared to Lot, and to the
   women who visited the sepulchre where Christ had been laid, are called
   men; because they appeared in the shape of men: But no one supposes
   they were real men; nor would they have been any more so, had they been
   united to real bodies. A man has not only a human body, but a human
   soul; both these are essential constituents of human nature, and
   necessary to make a man. The angelic nature, or superangelic, as such a
   supposed creature may be called, does not, and cannot be made human
   nature, or be made a real man, so as to be one of the human race, by
   uniting to a human body. He still will be an angel, or a creature of a
   higher order, and not a man. A distinction is made between angels and
   men, or the seed of Abraham, and it is said, that Jesus did not unite
   himself to the former, but to the latter. "For as much as the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of
   the same. For verily he took not an him the nature of angels; but he
   took on him the seed of Abraham." [358] Had the Eternal Word united
   himself to an angel, and taken a human body, he would have been an
   angel, and not a man; not the seed of the woman, or of Abraham. This
   would not have formed the relation of brethren between him and mankind;
   but between him and angels.

   "It behoved him to be made like unto his brethren in all things;" [359]
   which he could not have been, had he not taken upon him human nature,
   consisting in a human soul and body. Had he united himself to an angel,
   or any other creature of an higher order, and then that creature,
   united by the Word, have taken a human body, he would not have been
   made in all things like unto his brethren; but on the contrary, he
   would have taken but a very inconsiderable part of the human nature;
   and be far from being a man. This supposed first and greatest creature
   cannot, with any propriety or truth, be called a human soul, more than
   any other supposable, or possible creature that could be made: Nor
   would his union to a human body make him any more a human soul, than if
   he were not so united. A human soul comes into existence in union with
   the body, by which human nature, or the human creature, comes into
   existence.

   If this argument has any weight in it, is it not a sufficient reason
   for rejecting a scheme which does not appear to have any foundation in
   the sacred Oracles, and will not give any better or more exalted
   conceptions of the Redeemer, than the common opinion, which views his
   human nature as beginning to exist at the incarnation? But there are
   other objections to this scheme: For,

   Secondly, If only the body of Jesus came into existence, and was formed
   in the womb of the virgin Mary, he could not be really her son, or the
   Son of man, conceived by her, in her womb, as the scripture says he
   was. She who conceives and brings forth a son, is as really, and as
   much the mother of his soul, as of his body, and the former is
   conceived and formed in her womb as much as the latter; and is the
   greater and chief part of the child or son; yea, the most essential
   part, without which he would not be a son; but a monster, a body
   without a soul. Therefore, Mary's conception of her son did imply the
   conception of soul and body, otherwise she could not be said to
   conceive a son. The virgin Mary, and Elizabeth, are each of them said
   to conceive a son. [360] All must allow that the latter conceived a
   child, with a human soul and body; otherwise it would not have been the
   conception of a son. And why must not Mary's conception of a son imply
   the same? If not, how could he be her son, conceived by her?

   It is a mistake which some have made, who have supposed that the
   parents of a child, are the parents or authors of the body, and are
   instruments of producing that only, and not the soul of the child. They
   are the cause of one as much as the other, and no more. They are not
   the efficient cause of either. God is the cause of the existence of
   both soul and body; of the latter just as much as the other; both come
   into existence according to a law of nature, by which parents are made
   the instrumental cause of the production of the child, consisting of
   both soul and body. The mother, therefore, according to a law of
   nature, conceives both the soul and body of her son; she does as much
   towards the one, as towards the other, and is equally the instrumental
   cause of both; and God is as much the efficient, and immediate cause of
   the existence of the one as of the other. The human nature of Jesus was
   conceived not according to a stated law of nature; but in a miraculous
   way: Yet Mary as really conceived him, and he was as really her son, as
   if he had been conceived, according to the ordinary course of nature.
   But he was not conceived by her, neither could he be her son, if his
   soul, or that creature which took a body in her womb, had existed a
   mighty, glorious creature, thousands of years before this, as in this
   case she must have conceived nothing but a body; which is no
   conception, according to the proper use of the word; and could not be a
   son.

   Thirdly, We find it is the way and manner of the governor of the world,
   first to put his creatures, who are moral agents, upon trial, that
   through the appointed time of trial they may exercise and manifest
   submission to him, and obedience to the law and commands under which
   they are placed, before he admits them to glory, and publicly confirms
   them in happiness, that the latter may be the reward of the former, as
   a testimony of his approbation of their obedience; and this appears
   highly reasonable and proper. To make a creature and set him above
   every other creature, and confer upon him great and distinguishing
   honours, as being the greatest favourite, without putting him in a
   state of trial, and before he had performed any signal act of
   obedience, would be contrary to God's way of dealing with his
   creatures, so far as our acquaintance reaches, and would be very
   unreasonable, and altogether unbecoming the moral governor of the
   world, so far as we can judge. But the notion of the pre-existence of
   the human nature of Jesus Christ, (if on this plan it can be properly
   called human nature, or a human soul, which indeed it cannot) supposes
   that God has dealt so with this creature. He made him the first and
   highest of all creatures; and honoured him by making him the creator of
   all things, visible and invisible, angels and men; or using him as the
   great agent or instrument in this work; and set him over all creatures
   and things, as the director and governor of all worlds, in a state of
   high exaltation and glory; in which he continued four thousand years,
   before the great trial of his obedience took place. This therefore, is
   not to be admitted as true, or any part of the divine plan and conduct,
   without some cogent reasons which have not yet been produced; or unless
   it be plainly asserted in divine revelation, which is so far from being
   true, that it seems to speak a contrary language.

   But if, contrary to this notion, the human nature of Jesus Christ first
   began to exist at the incarnation, and he increased in wisdom and
   stature until he arrived to manhood, in a state and circumstances of
   trial; and persevered in a state of temptation, trial and suffering,
   and in obedience, in the form of a servant, unto death, even the death
   of the cross; and after this, and as a reward for such obedience and
   sufferings, "God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above
   every name;"--This is perfectly agreeable to God's conduct as moral
   governor of the world in other instances; and appears to be most
   reasonable and proper, and is suited to answer the best ends.

   Fourthly, The doctrine of the pre-existence of the creature, which was
   united to the human body in the womb of the virgin Mary, not only has
   no foundation in divine revelation, and is useless and unreasonable;
   but appears to be of a dangerous and bad tendency.

   Arius, and his followers, have espoused this notion in order to
   support, and render more plausible their denial of the divinity of
   Jesus Christ, or that he is truly God as well as man. By applying those
   passages of scripture to this supposed creature, which their opposers
   adduced to prove his divinity, and applied to Christ as God, and the
   second person in the Trinity; which has occasioned so much dispute in
   the christian world, in the fourth century, and since. It was therefore
   first advanced and improved to support an error, which really subverts
   Christianity. This gives just ground of suspicion, that it is itself an
   error: And it ought not to be received, until it be carefully examined
   and found to be well supported, and clearly asserted by divine oracles.

   And though many who now embrace this notion of the pre-existence of the
   human nature of Jesus Christ, do not consider themselves as giving up
   his divinity; or that they are doing any thing in the least
   inconsistent with this doctrine, or that tends in any degree to weaken
   or injure it; but hold that this pre-existing creature was united to
   the Deity, so as to be a divine person, and not a mere creature; yet
   they, by applying all or most of those passages of scripture to this
   dignified creature, which they who do not admit this opinion consider
   as properly applicable to the second person in the Trinity, who in the
   fulness of time took upon him human nature, do, in a measure, at least,
   obscure and weaken the doctrine of the divinity of Christ; and that of
   the Trinity of persons in the Deity; and hereby give great advantage to
   those who deny and oppose these doctrines.

   And this is rather confirmed, than otherwise, by fact and experience;
   since many, if not most of those who have embraced this sentiment of
   the pre-existence of the human nature of the Redeemer, give up the
   doctrine of the Trinity, of three distinct persons subsisting eternally
   in one God, independent of his works, or manner of operation, or at
   least doubt about the truth of it; and are rather inclined to consider
   this first and greatest creature, as a divine person, by a peculiar
   union to Deity, or to God; not considering him as subsisting in three
   persons, or in any sense three, considered in himself; but only in his
   different manner of acting, and distinct offices in his relation to his
   creatures, and works respecting them. And as this notion takes away and
   annihilates the divinity of Christ, as a distinct person in the
   Godhead, it tends to obscure and even remove the idea of his being
   really and properly God, and to consider him as a creature no otherwise
   united to God, than by having the divine presence and assistance in a
   peculiar and extraordinary manner and degree; and enjoying the peculiar
   favour and love of the Deity: That his divinity consists in this, and
   nothing more; and that his personality consists wholly in his nature,
   as a creature, as a distinct person from all other creatures, and
   vastly superior to them all; and not in his divinity, or divine nature.
   And as this scheme makes the Logos, or Word, to be the first and
   greatest of all creatures, they apply all those passages of scripture
   which speak of Jesus Christ before his incarnation to this creature,
   who, by taking the human body, became a man. Thus they are naturally,
   and even necessarily, led to give up the divinity of Jesus Christ, as
   it has been held by those who have acknowledged and adored him as the
   true God; and find themselves not to differ in their idea of the
   Redeemer, in any thing essential or important from the Arians, who have
   always denied the divinity of Christ, as it has been held by the
   greatest part of professing christians, in all ages. And this has been
   realized by fact in too many instances, of those who have embraced the
   notion of the pre-existence of the human nature of Christ. They have
   gone on to disbelieve and deny that he is truly God, or at least, to
   hesitate and doubt of it. And there is reason to fear, and even to
   expect, that if this notion prevails, a denial of the real divinity of
   the Redeemer will keep pace with it, and Jesus Christ, instead of being
   honoured by it, will be degraded infinitely below what he has been
   believed to be by the christian church in general, in all ages, and
   deprived of the honours which have been given to him; and which are
   ascribed to him in the divine oracles, as has been proved above.

   When all this is well considered, viz. That the doctrine of the
   pre-existence of Jesus Christ, as a creature, is no where expressly, or
   by implication, asserted in the scripture, and is not so consistent
   with it, as the contrary doctrine;--:hat it is at best a useless
   notion, and can answer no good end;--that it is not reasonable, and is
   contrary to the divine conduct, as moral governor;--that it is
   inconsistent with his being a real man, or the son of the virgin
   Mary;--that it appears in theory, and from fact and experience, to be
   of a dangerous and bad tendency; even to the dishonour of Christ, and
   the denial of his divinity; and consequently to sap the very foundation
   of christianity;--that it has been invented and propagated by those who
   have denied that the Redeemer of men is the true God, equal with the
   Father, in order to render their opposition to this doctrine more
   plausible;--that the best and most sound part of the church, and those
   who have been most eminent for wisdom and grace, and a conduct most
   agreeable to the gospel, have not received but rejected this
   doctrine:--If all this appears to be true; or if it be in part, and in
   some measure agreeable to the truth; may not this notion be rejected
   with safety and a degree of confidence? Yea, ought we not to renounce
   it, and embrace the contrary, which has been received by the christian
   church in general, from the days of the apostles, and supported by the
   best divines?

   9. The human nature of Jesus Christ never was tainted with the least
   moral corruption; but is perfectly holy. This is repeatedly asserted of
   him in the scriptures; and was absolutely necessary in order to his
   being the Redeemer of man. "For such an high priest became us, who is
   holy, harmless, undefiled» separate from sinners, and made higher than
   the heavens." [361] But how he could be a man, descend from Adam, and
   be really one of the human race, and not partake of the common
   corruption of mankind, has been a question of no small importance. This
   inquiry is answered by observing. That though by a divine constitution,
   all the posterity of Adam in a constituted natural way, or according to
   the established course of nature, are born in a state of total moral
   corruption, in consequence of his apostasy; which has been proved in a
   former chapter; yet this did not reach or affect the human nature of
   Jesus Christ, as he was conceived and born in a supernatural and
   miraculous way, and had no human father.

   When the constitution and covenant was made with Adam, and his natural
   posterity, it was not determined by any thing in this constitution,
   that there would be any such person as that of the Mediator, as it did
   not appear by any thing in that covenant, that there would be any need
   of a Redeemer; he was not, therefore, included in this constitution and
   covenant, as all the natural posterity of Adam were; but was introduced
   in consequence of the breach of that covenant; consequently, he did not
   partake of the moral pollution and depravity which came upon the
   natural posterity of Adam, who were included in that covenant. And he
   is not only not one included in the covenant made with Adam; as he does
   not descend from him in the ordinary, natural way; but he is "the Lord
   from heaven." The human nature of Christ began to exist in a personal
   union with the second person in the Triune God, and so is infinitely
   distinguished from the rest of the children of Adam." [362]

   10. The incarnation of Jesus Christ, or his becoming man, by his taking
   the human nature into a personal union with the divine, is no part of
   his humiliation, nor is, in itself, in any respect or degree,
   degrading, laying aside, or hindering his glory. The manner and
   circumstances of his incarnation, in his being born of a poor virgin,
   in an infant state, and lodged in a stable, and attended with the
   innocent infirmities of the human nature, and in it suffering disgrace,
   pain and death, are all parts of the humiliation of Christ; but the
   incarnation itself is no part of it. If it were, he would be in a state
   of humiliation now, and forever hereafter; for he is a man now, and
   will continue to be such a person eternally.

   The union of the divine nature with the human, is an instance of
   wonderful condescension and grace, and will be celebrated as such, by
   the redeemed forever. But the second person in the Trinity will not be
   less, but more honoured and glorious forever, than if he were not man,
   as well as God.

   III. The Redeemer is the Son of God, in a peculiar and appropriated
   sense, and by which he is distinguished from every other person in the
   universe. He is therefore called the first begotten, or first born son
   of God: his only begotten son; his own son; and eminently The Son, and
   The Son of the Father. His dear Son; or, as it is in the original, The
   Son of his love; His beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased. "For he
   received from God the Father, honour and glory, when there came such a
   voice to him from the excellent glory. This is my beloved Son, in whom
   I am well pleased." [363] He is "The only begotten Son, which is in the
   bosom of the Father." [364] Who only knows the Father; and none does or
   can reveal and make him known but the Son. [365] He being the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person; he that
   hath seen the Son, hath seen the Father. [366] Which epithets and
   declarations distinguish him from all other sons; as much as his Father
   is distinguished from all other fathers. He is mentioned as the Son of
   God above an hundred times in the New Testament; and fifty times by the
   apostle John. And the Father of Jesus Christ, the Son, is mentioned
   above two hundred and twenty times; and more than one hundred and
   thirty times in the gospel and epistles of St. John. Jesus Christ often
   makes use of the epithets, The Father, My Father, &c. This character is
   represented as essential to the Redeemer and peculiar to him, and is an
   essential article of the christian faith. This confession Peter made as
   the common faith of the disciples of Christ. "We believe, and are sure
   that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God." [367] This was
   the Eunuch's faith, required in order to his being baptized. "I believe
   that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." [368] And he who believes with
   all his heart, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, hath the Son, and
   with him eternal life. When Peter made this confession, "Thou art
   Christ, the Son of the living God," Christ said to him, "Blessed art
   thou; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father
   which is in heaven." [369] "He that believeth on the Son hath
   everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see
   life." [370] And John says, "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the
   Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. Who is he that
   overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
   God! He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
   God, hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe
   on the name of the Son of God: that ye may know ye have eternal life,
   and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." [371]

   It must be farther observed, that this title, the Son of God, is the
   highest title that is given to the Redeemer, and denotes his divinity,
   or that he is himself God, and therefore equal with the Father, if his
   divinity be any where expressed in the Bible; and that it is there
   abundantly declared, we have before shewed. He styles himself, and is
   called The Son of Man, more than eighty times in the New Testament, by
   which epithet his humanity is more especially denoted, but not
   excluding his divinity. And, on the contrary, he is called the Son of
   God, more particularly to express his infinitely superior character,
   his divinity or godhead. In this view, let the following passages be
   considered. When the angel who declared to the virgin Mary that she
   should be the mother of the Messiah, expressed to her the greatness of
   this her Son, he does it by saying that he should be called the Son of
   the Highest, the Son of God. "He shall be great, and shall be called
   the Son of the Highest. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be
   born of thee, shall be called the Son of God." [372] If this were not
   his greatest, his highest title and character, he most certainly would
   have given him a higher, and one that did fully express divinity. This,
   therefore, did express it in the fullest and strongest manner. And no
   one who believes in the divinity of Christ, can, consistently, have any
   doubt of it. And when the Father gives him the highest encomium, and
   recommends him to men, as worthy of their highest regards, implicit
   obedience, and unlimited trust and confidence, and commands them thus
   to regard, love, trust in, and obey him, this is the highest character
   he gives him, by which his divinity is expressed, "This is my beloved
   Son, in whom lam well pleased: Hear ye him." If this does not express
   his divinity, we may be sure divinity is no part of his character; and
   that he is not God. So, when Peter undertakes to express the idea he
   had of the high and glorious character of his Lord and Master, he does
   it in the following words, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
   God." If Peter believed the divinity of Christ, he certainly expressed
   this in these words; for he did not conceive of any higher character,
   that could be given in any other words. This also appears by
   Nathaniel's using this epithet, when he was struck with wonder and
   surprise at the omniscience of Christ. "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God,
   thou art the King of Israel." [373] When our Lord Jesus Christ proposed
   himself to the man whom he had restored to sight, as the proper object
   of his faith and trust, he said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son
   of God?" And when he told the man that he himself was the person, he
   said, "Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him." [374] It appears from
   this, that Son of God, was the highest title which Jesus assumed, and
   that this had special reference to, and expressed his divinity; and
   therefore in this character, and as the Son of God, this pious man paid
   him divine honour, and worshipped him. When the disciples of our Lord,
   and all that were in the ship with them, had seen him walking upon the
   sea, in the midst of a terrible storm, and reducing the boisterous
   winds, and raging waves, to a calm, by his word and presence, they were
   struck with a fresh and affecting conviction of his divinity, that he
   was God, and expressed it by coming to him, falling down and
   worshipping him, "saying, of a truth, thou art the Son of God." [375]
   In which words they expressed his divinity, and gave a reason for their
   worshipping him, as their Lord and their God, viz. that they were sure
   from clear and abundant evidence, that he was the Son of God. The
   apostle John, when he would represent Jesus Christ in his highest and
   most glorious character, gives him this title, and adds, "This is the
   true God." He says, "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath
   given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true: And we
   are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true
   God, and eternal life." [376]

   It is to be farther observed, that when our Lord said to the Jews. "My
   Father worketh hitherto, and I work," the Jews, therefore, sought the
   more to kill him, because he said that God was his Father, (his own
   proper Father, as it is in the original) making himself equal with
   God." This is to be understood as the sense which St. John the
   Evangelist puts upon the words of Christ, "My Father worketh hitherto,
   and I work." For this was making himself equal with God the Father, as
   doing the same work with him: And this is represented as implied in
   God's being his own Father; or in his being the Father's own Son, the
   Son of God. But if we understand it as the sense which the Jews put
   upon the words of Christ, and that they said this was making himself
   equal with God, it amounts to the same thing; for it appears that their
   inference was just; and our Saviour is so far from denying it to be
   true, that in his reply to them, he confirms it, and asserts that
   whatsoever the Father does, the Son does the same; and instances in his
   raising the dead, and judging the world, and having all things, and all
   power in his hands. "That all men should honour the Son, even as they
   honour the Father." [377] Thus he makes the Son equal with the Father.
   Hence it appears that to be the Son of God, and God's own Son, is the
   same with a divine person, and denotes one who is truly God; and that
   this title is used to express the divinity, rather than the humanity of
   Jesus Christ.

   The same appears from what passed between our Lord and the Jews at
   another time. He said to them, "I and my Father are One." This, they
   said, was blasphemy, because being a man, he made himself God. It is
   plain from the answer which he makes to them that they considered him
   as a blasphemer, because he claimed to be the Son of God, by calling
   God his Father. "Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and
   sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of
   God?" This was the blasphemy with which they charged him; because they
   considered his saying, that he was the Son of God, by calling God his
   Father, as an assertion that he was God. [378] And it appears, not only
   from this passage, but from others, that the Jews, and others, did
   affix the idea of divinity to the Son of God, and considered this title
   as expressing a character infinitely above a mere creature. When Jesus
   was arraigned before the Jewish council, the High Priest charged him
   with the solemnity of an oath, saying, "I adjure thee by the living
   God, that thou tell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of the
   living God." And when Jesus answered in the affirmative, he with all
   the members of the council, charged him with blasphemy; and pronounced
   him worthy of death for making this claim. [379] And they brought this
   accusation against him to Pilate, "We have a law, and by our law he
   ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. When, therefore,
   Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid." [380] By this, it is
   evident that Pilate considered the Son of God, to imply divinity. When
   the Centurion, and the guard who were with him, saw the earthquake and
   the other supernatural events which attended the crucifixion of Jesus
   Christ, "they feared greatly, saying. Truly this was the Son of God."
   [381] From this, it is evident that they considered the Son of God to
   be more than a man, at least, if not really God.

   There was some idea and belief propagated among other nations, as well
   as the Jews, of an extraordinary personage, a divinity, who was
   denominated The Son of God, and who was to make his appearance in the
   world. To this, Nebuchadnezzar doubtless had reference, when he said,
   that in a vision, he saw a fourth person, walking in the midst of the
   fire of the furnace into which he had cast three men; and that none of
   them had been hurt by the fire; and the form of the fourth was like the
   Son of God. [382] And who but this divine person can be meant by Agur,
   when he says, "Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? Who hath
   gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in a garment?
   Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and
   what is his Son's name, if thou canst tell?" [383]

   This epithet and character we find expressly mentioned by David, the
   divinely inspired king of Israel, in the second Psalm. And he is there
   introduced and described, as a divinity, who claims divine homage,
   trust, and worship, as the Omnipotent heir, possessor and ruler of the
   world. "I will declare the decree. The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art
   MY SON, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee
   the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
   for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou
   shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Be wise now,
   therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the
   Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be
   angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a
   little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him." [384] From
   this ancient oracle in Israel, and from a revelation which was made
   upon the first apostasy, and handed down by tradition, not only the
   Jews, but also those of other nations who had any particular connexion
   with them, were taught to consider the expected Messiah as the Son of
   God in a peculiar and appropriated sense; and as implying real
   divinity. Therefore, it was supposed on all hands, that this person,
   the Son of God, the King of Israel, the King of the Jews, was to be
   worshipped as worthy to receive divine honours. Hence the wise men from
   the East, being admonished of the birth of this glorious personage,
   came to worship him, to pay him divine honours; for which they had a
   particular warrant, having had him pointed out to them by a star, which
   was a known symbol, or hieroglyphic of the Divinity, or a God. And
   Herod took it for granted, that this person was to be worshipped, and
   receive divine honours. For he said to the wise men, "When ye have
   found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."

   All this will be of no weight, indeed, and as nothing with the
   Anti-trinitarians, the Sebellians; and with all those who deny the
   divinity of Jesus Christ, the Arians and Socinians. But they who
   believe in a Trinity of persons in the Deity, and that Jesus Christ is
   God, the second person of the Trinity, must be sensible that he is
   called the Son of God, the Son of the Father, with a special reference
   to his divine nature, and to denote his Godhead, as the second person
   in the Triune God.--The Arians and Socinians hold that he is the Son of
   God, considered as a mere creature, being by this distinguished from
   all other creatures; and consequently that there was no Son of God
   before this creature did exist. The latter, or Trinitarians, believe
   that the Sonship of Jesus Christ, necessarily includes his divinity;
   but are not all agreed as to the foundation of his Sonship, and in what
   it consists. It has been generally believed, and the common doctrine of
   the church of Christ, from the beginning of the fourth century, and so
   far as appears from the days of the apostles to this time, that Jesus
   Christ is the eternal Son of God: That his Sonship is essential to him,
   as the second person in the Trinity, and that in this sense he is the
   only begotten Son of the Father, antecedent to his incarnation, and
   independent on it, even from eternity. But there are some who think
   that the Sonship of the Redeemer consists in an union of the second
   person of the Trinity, or the Word, with the human nature; and that lie
   became the Son of God by becoming man; and therefore before the
   incarnation, there was no Son of God, though there were a Trinity of
   persons in the Godhead. This opinion seems to be rather gaining ground,
   and spreading, of late.

   Those on each side of this question differ in their opinion of the
   importance of it, and of the bad tendency of either of these opposite
   sentiments. Some suppose that the difference is of little or no
   importance, as both believe the Redeemer to be God and man, in one
   person, and that he is the Son of God, and that this implies his
   divinity, though they differ in opinion respecting the time and manner
   of his filiation. Others think this is a difference so great and
   important, and attended with such consequences; and that those who are
   opposed to them on this point embrace such a great and dangerous error,
   that they ought to be strenuously opposed: and consequently do not
   desire an accommodation, or think it possible.

   Though it be needless and improper here to undertake the labour of
   entering into all the arguments which have been produced, or may be
   mentioned in support of each side of this question; yet the following
   observations may not be altogether useless; but may be of some help to
   form a judgment upon this point, agreeable to the scriptures.

   1. As this question respects the character of the Redeemer, it may
   justly be considered as an important one; as every thing relating to
   his character is very important and interesting. Who would be willing
   to be found at last taking the wrong side of this question; and always
   to have entertained so unbecoming ideas and conceptions of the
   Redeemer, which his must be, if on this point he embraces and contends
   for that which is directly contrary to the truth? Though such an error
   should not be fatal to him who embraces it, but be consistent with his
   being a real christian; yet it must be a very criminal mistake, and
   dishonourable to Jesus Christ; as every idea of him must be, which is
   contrary to his true character: For that is so perfect and glorious,
   that nothing can be taken from it, or added to it, which will not mar
   and dishonour it. His character, as it respects the question before us,
   is without doubt properly and clearly stated in divine revelation, and
   if we embrace that which is contrary to the truth, it must be wholly
   our own fault, and a very criminal abuse of the advantages which we
   enjoy, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ his Son, whom he has
   sent. Those considerations ought to awaken our attention to this
   subject, and excite a concern and earnest desire to know and embrace
   the truth; which will be attended with a modest, humble, diligent
   inquiry, sensible of the danger in which we are, through prejudice, or
   from other causes, of embracing error; and earnestly looking to the
   great Prophet to lead us into the truth.

   2. What has been observed above, and, it is believed, made evident,
   viz. that the term, Son of God, so often given to Christ, is used to
   denote his divine nature, and to express his divinity, rather than his
   humanity, seems naturally, if not necessarily, to lead us to consider
   this character as belonging to him independent of his union to the
   human nature, and antecedent to his becoming man; and therefore, that
   it belongs to him as God, the second person in the Trinity. For if his
   Sonship consists in his union to the human nature, and he became a son,
   only by becoming a man; then this character depends wholly upon this
   union, and is derived from his being made flesh: Therefore this epithet
   could not be properly used to denote his divinity, independent of his
   humanity, or what he is as a divine person, antecedent to his
   incarnation; or to express his divine, rather than his human nature.
   And Son of God, would be no higher a character, and express no more
   than Son of man; which is contrary to the idea which the scripture
   gives us on this head, as has been shown.

   This may, perhaps, be in some measure illustrated by the following
   instance. The son of a nobleman of the first honour and dignity, came
   from Europe, and married the daughter of a plebeian in America, by
   which he became his son: But as his honour and dignity did not consist
   in his marrying this woman, or in his being the son of the plebeian, by
   this union with his daughter, but in his original character; no man
   thought of expressing his highest and most dignified character by which
   he was worthy of the greatest respect, by using an epithet which
   denoted only his union to that woman, and which was not applicable to
   him in any other view; or by calling him son, as expressing this new
   relation: But the highest title which they gave him, was that which had
   a special respect to, and expressed his original character, which he
   sustained antecedent to this union; and in which his highest dignity
   consisted. And he being the son of a nobleman and a lord, in which all
   his honour and dignity did consist, they used this phrase, My noble
   Lord, to express their highest respect, and his most worthy character.
   This epithet was always used to express his original and highest
   character and relation, and could not, with propriety, be used to
   express any thing else. He was often called, indeed, the son of the
   plebeian, when they designed particularly to express his union to his
   wife, and speak of him as standing in this relation.

   3. The Son of God is spoken of in many instances, if not in every one
   where this term is used, so as will naturally lead the reader to
   consider him as sustaining this character and relation antecedent to
   his incarnation, and independent of it. "God so loved the world that he
   gave his only begotten Son." [385] Do not these words seem to express
   this idea, viz. that there existed an only begotten son, antecedent to
   his being given; that God gave this his Son to the world by his
   becoming flesh, and being united to the human nature; and not that he
   became his Son by this union? "In this was manifested the love of God
   towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world,
   that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God,
   but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our
   sins." [386] If God sent his only begotten Son into the world, does not
   this suppose he had a Son to send, antecedent to his sending him; and
   that he did not become his Son by his sending him into the world, or
   only in consequence of this? This is expressed in the same manner by
   St. Paul. "But when the fulness of time was come God sent forth his
   Son, made of a woman, made under the law." [387] The Son was sent
   forth. Does not this seem at least to imply that there was a Son to be
   sent forth antecedent to his being made of a woman, and that he was not
   made a Son, by being made of a woman, or becoming man? "No man hath
   seen God at any time: The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
   the Father, he hath declared him." [388] Do not these words naturally
   lead us to conceive of the only begotten Son as existing in the nearest
   union with the Father as his Son, independent of the human nature?

   It is said, "God was manifested in the flesh." [389] It would be
   unnatural and absurd to suppose, from this &gt; expression, that Jesus
   Christ was not God, antecedent to his being manifested in the flesh,
   and that by his becoming man, he became a God. Directly the contrary to
   this is asserted, viz. that he who is God from eternity, did in time
   appear in the human nature, and manifested himself to be God,
   independent of the flesh, in which he appeared. It is also said, "For
   this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the
   works of the devil." [390] These two passages appear to be parallel.
   God manifested in the flesh, and the Son of God manifested, are two
   expressions of the same thing. From this it may be inferred, that the
   Son of God, and God, are synonymous here, and of the same import. This
   serves to confirm what has been said above of the use and meaning of
   the term, Son of God. And may it not with equal certainty be inferred
   from these two passages, compared together, that the Son of God existed
   in this character as the Son of God, antecedent to his manifestation in
   the flesh, and independent of it; and that he did not become the Son of
   God by being made flesh? If God be manifested in the flesh, there must
   be a God to be manifested antecedent to such manifestation, and
   independent of it. And is it not equally certain that if the Son of God
   be manifested, he must have existed the Son of God, antecedent to such
   manifestation, and independent of it? Consequently he did not become
   the Son of God by his being manifested .in the flesh: His Sonship does
   not consist in the union of the divine and human natures in one person.
   His personality existed before this union with the human nature; and he
   was the Son of God before this: This same Son of God, this same person
   who existed without beginning, assumed the human nature, not a human
   person, into a union with himself, his own person, and so appeared, was
   manifested in the flesh. ?

   When David speaks of the Son of God, and represents the Father as
   saying, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," so long
   before his incarnation, the idea which most naturally arises in the
   mind from this is, that there was then such a person as the Son, who
   did at that time declare the decree, by the mouth of David; and not,
   that there should in some future time be a Son begotten, who should
   then declare the decree. "I will declare the decree: The Lord said unto
   me, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee." It is very
   unnatural, and contrary to all propriety of speech to suppose, "this
   day have I begotten thee," means I will beget thee in some future time;
   and that the Son should be made to declare the decree, long before any
   such person existed; and when there was in fact no such Son. The decree
   which the Son declares is not that declaration, "Thou art my son, this
   day have I begotten thee;" but what follows, "ask of me, and I will
   give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
   the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron,
   &:c." "This day," that is, now, not in time which is passed, or which
   is to come; for with God there is no succession, no time passed or to
   come; but he exists, as we may say, in one eternal, unsuccessive now.
   Therefore, when he speaks of an eternal, immanent act, it is most
   properly expressed thus, "This day, or now, have I begotten thee." This
   therefore is the sense in which the best divines have generally
   understood it.

   St. Paul cites this passage as being illustrated and verified in the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ. [391] But he cannot mean that he by the
   resurrection became the Son of God, and was then begotten: for he had
   this title before that. His meaning is explained by himself in his
   epistle to the Romans. "Declared lo be the Son of God, by the
   resurrection from the dead." [392] That is, this was a fresh and open
   manifestation and declaration that he was indeed what had been often
   asserted of him, and what he always was: The only begotten Son of God.

   What the angel said to the virgin Mary, "He shall be great, and shall
   be called the Son of the highest--The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
   and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee: Therefore also that
   holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of
   God," cannot reasonably be understood as a declaration that his sonship
   consisted in his miraculous conception, or in the union of the second
   person of the Trinity with the human nature, thus conceived: But that
   this child, conceived in this manner, and born of a virgin, should
   appear, and be known to be the Son of God, that very person who had
   been spoken of and known in all past ages by this title; of whom Isaiah
   had particularly spoken, when he said, "Behold, a virgin shall
   conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Unto us a
   Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder: And his
   name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God:" [393]
   That this Son was now to be born of the virgin Mary: The long expected
   Messiah, who is considered and spoken of by the people of God, by the
   title of the Son of God, which title he shall bear, as he is indeed the
   mighty God.

   We are naturally lead to consider the Son of God as existing in this
   character before his incarnation, and the same with the Word, by what
   is said of him in the first chapter of John. "The Word was made flesh,
   and dwelt among us; and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of
   the Father. No man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten Son,
   which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. John bare
   witness of him, and cried, saying, this was he of whom I spake, he that
   cometh after me, is preferred before me: For he was before me. And I
   saw, and bear record that this is the Son of God." Here John is
   represented as asserting that the Son of God, concerning whom he bore
   witness, did exist before him, which therefore must be before his
   incarnation; for John was conceived before the incarnation of Jesus.
   But how can this be true, if there were no Son of God, before John
   existed? But if we consider the Word and the Son of God as synonymous,
   who was in the beginning with God, and who was God, and created all
   things, this whole chapter will be plain and easy to be understood; and
   we shall see John bearing witness to the Son of God, who existed before
   him in this character, and was now come in the flesh.

   We find the same representation made in the epistle to the Hebrews.
   "God, who spake in time past unto the fathers, by the prophets, hath in
   these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir
   of all things; by whom also he made the worlds. Who being the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power," &c. How could God make
   the worlds by his Son, four thousand years before he had a Son; and on
   this supposition, where is the propriety or truth of this assertion?
   And how could the Son be said to uphold all things by the word of his
   power, thousands of years before any Son existed? "And again, when he
   bringeth the first begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the
   angels of God worship him." This expression naturally suggests the idea
   that God the Father had a first begotten Son to bring into the world,
   whom he commanded the angels to worship. How can he be said to bring
   his first begotten Son into the world, when he had no such Son to bring
   into the world; and indeed never did bring this his Son into the world,
   if he was begotten, and received his sonship in this world, when he
   took the human nature in the womb of the virgin, and was not a son
   before?

   Again, speaking of Melchisedec, he says, he was "Without father,
   without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor
   end of life; but made like unto the Son of God." [394] If there were no
   Son of God till the human nature of Christ existed, then the Son of God
   did begin to exist; consequently there was a beginning of his days; and
   Melchisedec was not made like him, but unlike to him, by having no
   beginning of days.

   Since there are so many passages of scripture, (and there are many more
   than have now been mentioned) which seem to represent the Redeemer as
   the Son of God, antecedent to his incarnation, and independent of it,
   which will naturally lead those who attend to them to this idea of him;
   and some of them cannot be easily reconciled to the contrary opinion;
   this will fully account for the generally received doctrine in the
   christian world from the earliest ages to this time, viz. That the
   Redeemer of man is the second person in the Trinity, the eternal Son of
   God, who in the fulness of time was made flesh, by a personal union
   with the human nature.

   4. It is worthy of consideration, whether the contrary opinion, viz.
   That the Redeemer is the Son of God, only by the second person in the
   Trinity being united to human nature, and becoming man, does not
   naturally lead to dangerous and evil consequences; and what good end is
   to be answered by it? If it be not agreeable to scripture, we know it
   must be dangerous and hurtful in a greater or less degree, (as all
   errors respecting the person and character of the Redeemer are) and
   naturally tends to lead into other mistakes, still greater, and of
   worse consequence. And if it be agreeable to scripture, it certainly
   has no bad tendency. If, therefore, it does appear from reasoning upon
   it, or from fact and experience, that this opinion tends to evil
   consequences, and has a bad effect; we may safely conclude that it is
   wrong, and contrary to divine revelation.

   1. Does not this sentiment tend to lower our ideas of the Redeemer, and
   lead into a way of thinking less honourably of him? It has been
   observed that it appears from scripture, that this title, Son of God,
   was used to express the highest and most honourable idea which his
   friends had of his person and character. But if we understand by it,
   nothing but what takes place by his union to man, by taking flesh upon
   him, and consider it as signifying nothing but what took place by his
   becoming man, nothing is expressed by it more than by Son of man: And
   we are left without any epithet or common scripture phrase, whereby to
   express the divinity, the Godhead of the Redeemer, and his equality
   with the Father. Thus, instead of raising our conceptions of the
   Redeemer, does it not tend to sink them? Does not the sonship of Christ
   become an infinitely less and more inconsiderable matter, upon this
   plan, than that which has always been esteemed the orthodox sentiment
   on this point, which considers his sonship, as wholly independent of
   the whole creation, as eternal, and altogether divine?

   We live in an age when the enemies of the Redeemer lift up their heads,
   and are suffered to multiply and prevail. The deists attempt to cast
   him out as an imposter. Arians and Socinians strip him of his divinity:
   And the careless, ignorant, immoral and profane, treat him with
   contempt or neglect. This is agreeable to his great enemy, Satan; who
   seems now to be let loose in an unusual degree, and has uncommon power
   among men, to lead them into gross errors, and those especially which
   are dishonourable to Christ, and injurious to his character. And if
   this sentiment now under consideration, concerning the sonship of the
   Redeemer, should spread and prevail now, this would be no evidence in
   favour of it; but, considering what has been now observed, concerning
   it, would it not give reason to suspect, at least, that it is
   dishonourable to the Son of God, and leads to other errors yet more
   dishonourable to him?

   This leads to observe,

   2. It is worthy of consideration, whether this doctrine of the
   filiation of Jesus Christ, does not tend to reject the doctrine of the
   Trinity, as it has been held by those who have been called the orthodox
   in the christian church, and leads to what is called Sabellianism;
   which considers the Deity as but one person, and to be three only out
   of respect to the different manner or kind of his operations.

   This notion of the sonship of Christ, leads to suppose that the Deity
   is the Father of the Mediator, without distinction of persons; and that
   by Father so often mentioned in the New Testament, and generally in
   relation to the Son, is commonly, if not always, meant Deity, without
   distinction of persons. If this be so, it tends to exclude all
   distinction of persons in God, and to make the personality of the
   Redeemer to consist wholly in the human nature; and finally, to make
   his union with Deity no more, but the same which Arians and Socinians
   admit, viz. the same which takes place between God and good men in
   general; but in a higher and peculiar degree.

   But if there be no tendency in this doctrine of the sonship of Christ,
   to the consequences which have been now mentioned; and it can be made
   evident that none of those supposed evils do attend it, or can follow
   from it; yet it remains to be considered what advantage attends it, and
   the good ends it will answer, if it were admitted to be true. None will
   say, it is presumed, that it is more agreeable to the general
   expressions of scripture relating to this point, than the opposite
   doctrine; who well considers what has been observed above. The most
   that any one can with justice say with respect to this is, that the
   scripture may be so construed and understood, as to be consistent with
   the sonship of Christ, commencing at the incarnation, however
   inconsistent with it some passages may appear at first view.

   It may be thought, perhaps, that this notion of the sonship of the
   Redeemer is attended with two advantages, if not with more, viz. It
   frees the doctrine of the Trinity from that which is perfectly
   incomprehensible, and appears a real contradiction and absurdity; that
   the second person should be Son of the first, who is the Father; the
   Son being begotten by the Father from eternity; than which nothing can
   be more inconceivable, and seemingly absurd. And this appears
   inconsistent with the second person being equal with the first; for a
   son begotten of a father, implies inferiority, and that he exists after
   his father, and consequently begins to exist, and is dependent. Both
   these difficulties are wholly avoided, it is thought, by supposing that
   the second person in the Trinity became a son by being united to the
   human nature, and begotten in the womb of the virgin. And it is
   probable that these supposed advantages have recommended this scheme of
   the sonship of Christ, to those who embrace it, and led them to reject
   the commonly received opinion; and not a previous conviction that the
   former is most agreeable to the scripture. This therefore demands our
   serious and candid attention. And the following things may be observed
   upon it.

   1. If we exclude every thing from our creed, concerning God, his
   existence, and the manner of his existence, which to us is
   incomprehensible and unaccountable, we must reject the doctrine of the
   Trinity in unity, and even of the existence of a God. The doctrine of
   three persons in one God is wholly inconceivable by us, and Unitarians
   consider it as the greatest contradiction and absurdity imaginable. And
   those Trinitarians, who have undertaken to explain it, and make it more
   intelligible, have generally failed of giving any light; but have
   really made it absurd and even ridiculous, by "darkening counsel by
   words without knowledge." If we reasoned properly on the matter, we
   should expect to find in a revelation which God has made of himself,
   his being and manner of subsistence, mysteries which we can by no means
   understand, which are to creatures wonderful, and wholly unaccountable.
   For the being of God, and the manner of his existence, and of his
   subsisting, must be infinitely above our comprehension: God is
   infinitely great, and we know him not. And if we attempt to search out
   these mysteries by reason, we are prone to think they are
   contradictions and absurdities, merely because our reason cannot fathom
   them; and they appear more unintelligible, the more we try to
   understand them. "Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find
   out the Almighty to perfection? It is as high as heaven, what canst
   thou do? Deeper than hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is
   longer than the earth, and broader than the sea." [395] "Teach us what
   we shall say unto him, (and what we shall say concerning him;) for we
   cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. Shall it be told him
   that I speak?" and attempt to comprehend and explain the mysteries that
   relate to his existence? "If a man speaks surely he shall be swallowed
   up." [396] If a man undertake thus to speak, instead of giving any
   light, he will be involved and overwhelmed in impenetrable darkness.

   They, therefore, who do not believe the eternal sonship of Jesus
   Christ, because it is mysterious and incomprehensible, and to some it
   appears to be full of contradiction, will, if they be consistent with
   themselves, for the same reason, reject the doctrine of a Trinity of
   persons in one God. [397]

   2. If the doctrine of the eternal generation and sonship of the second
   person in the Trinity be soberly and modestly considered in the light
   of the foregoing observation, and with a proper sense of our own
   darkness and infinite inferiority to the divine Being, and how little
   we can know of him; we shall not be forward to pronounce it
   inconsistent with reason, and absurd; but be convinced, that to do
   thus, is very bold and assuming; and that it may be consistent and
   true, notwithstanding any thing we may know; though it be mysterious
   and incomprehensible. This is a divine generation, infinitely above any
   thing that takes place among creatures, and infinitely different. It is
   that of which we can have no adequate idea, and is infinitely out of
   our reach. What incompetent judges are we then of this matter? What
   right or ability have we to pronounce it absurd or inconsistent, when
   we have no capacity to know or determine what is true, consistent, or
   inconsistent in this high point, any farther than God has been pleased
   to reveal it to us? There may be innumerable mysteries in the existence
   and manner of subsistence of the infinite Being, which are, and must
   be, incomprehensible, by a finite understanding. God has been pleased,
   for wise ends, to reveal that of the Trinity, and this of the eternal
   generation and sonship of the second person: And he has done it in a
   manner, and in words best suited to convey those ideas of it to men,
   which it is necessary they should have: And we ought to receive it with
   meekness and implicit submission, using our reason in excluding every
   thing which is contrary to, or below infinite perfection, and absolute
   independence; without pretending to comprehend it, or to be able to
   judge of that which is infinitely high and divine, by that which takes
   place among creatures, with respect to generation, and father and son.

   God is said in scripture, to repent and be grieved at his heart; to be
   angry, and to have his fury to come up in his face; and hands, feet,
   eyes, mouth, lips and tongue, &c. are ascribed to him. These words are
   designed and suited to convey useful ideas, and important instruction
   to men. But if we should understand these expressions as meaning the
   same thing in the Divine Being, that they do when applied to men; we
   must entertain very unworthy, and most absurd notions of God, and
   wholly inconsistent with other declarations in the sacred Oracles. But
   if we exclude every thing that is human, or that implies any change or
   imperfection from these expressions when applied to the Deity, they
   will convey nothing absurd or inconsistent, or that is unworthy of God.
   And it will doubtless be equally so in the case before us; if it be
   constantly kept in mind that the only begotten Son of God denotes
   nothing human, but is infinitely above any thing which relates to
   natural, or creature generation, and does not include any beginning,
   change, dependence, inferiority, or imperfection. This will effectually
   exclude all real absurdity and contradiction.

   It will be asked, perhaps, when all this is excluded from our ideas of
   generation, of Father and Son, what idea will remain in our minds,
   which is conveyed by these words? Will they not be without any
   signification to us, and altogether useless? To this, the following
   answer may be given: From what is revealed concerning this high and
   incomprehensible mystery, we learn, that in the existence of the Deity,
   there is that which is high above our thoughts, as the heavens are
   above the earth, infinitely beyond our conception, and different from
   any thing which takes place among creatures, which is a foundation of a
   personal distinction, as real and great as that between father and son
   among men, and infinitely more perfect: Which distinction may be in the
   best manner conveyed to us by Father and Son, to express the most
   perfect union and equality; that the Son is the brightness of the
   Father's glory, and the express image of his person, and that there is
   infinite love and endearment between them; and that in the economy of
   the work of redemption, the Son is obedient to the Father, Sec. All
   this, and much more, our minds are capable of conceiving from what is
   revealed on this high and important subject; which is suited to impress
   our hearts with a sense of the incomprehensible, infinite, adorable
   perfection and glory of the Father and the Son; and is necessary in
   order to give us a right understanding of the gospel; of the true
   character of the Redeemer, and of the work of redemption.

   What has been now said under this second particular, may serve to
   remove the other supposed difficulty in admitting the eternal filiation
   of the second person in the Trinity, viz. that it represents the Son as
   inferior to the Father, and as existing after him, and therefore his
   existence had a beginning. This is obviated by the above observations;
   and particularly by this, that it is a divine filiation, and therefore
   infinitely unlike that which is human; and above our comprehension.
   Besides, to suppose eternal generation admits of before or after, or of
   a beginning, is inconsistent. It may be further observed,

   3. That the opinion that Jesus Christ is the first and only begotten
   Son of God, by the second person in the Trinity becoming incarnate, and
   united to the human nature, is, perhaps, attended with as great
   difficulties as the other which has been considered, if not greater. If
   so, the inducement to embrace it, and reject the other, which we are
   examining, wholly ceases.

   If the Son was begotten by the miraculous formation of the human
   nature; then the Holy Ghost begot the Son and is the Father, as much as
   the first person in the Trinity. For the angel said to the virgin, "The
   Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee: Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
   thee, shall be called the Son of God." If we take these words as
   referring only to the production of the human nature, and if it be
   granted that by die highest, is meant the first person in the Trinity,
   of which there does not appear to be any evidence, yet the third
   person, the Holy Ghost, is represented as doing as much, and being as
   active in this production as the first person. But if this were no
   difficulty, and the first person of the Trinity be supposed to produce
   the human nature, and in this sense to be the Father of Jesus Christ;
   yet this will make him his Father in no other and higher sense than he
   is the Father of angels, and of Adam; and Jesus Christ will be the Son
   of God in no other, or higher sense than they; for they were created
   and formed in an extraordinary, miraculous way.

   If the Son was begotten by uniting the second person of the Trinity
   with the human nature, and the filiation of the Son is supposed to
   consist wholly in being thus united to man; this is attended with the
   following difficulties, as great, perhaps, if not greater, than those
   which attend the eternal Sonship of the second person.

   1. This is as different in nature and kind from natural or creature
   generation, as eternal divine generation; and the one bears no analogy
   or likeness to the other.

   2. This union of God with the creature so as to become one person, is
   as mysterious and incomprehensible, as the eternal Sonship of the
   second person of the Trinity; and as inexplicable: So that nothing is
   gained with respect to this, by embracing this scheme.

   3. It is not agreeable to scripture to suppose that the first person of
   the Trinity only, united the second person to the human nature, and so
   became a Father by thus begetting a Son. The third person, the Holy
   Ghost, is represented as doing this, or at least, being active in it;
   and there is nothing expressly said of the first person doing any thing
   respecting it as such. "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
   power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: Therefore also, that holy
   thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God."
   "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. When his mother, Mary,
   was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
   child of the Holy Ghost." And the angel of the Lord said unto Joseph,
   "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: For that which is conceived
   in her, is of the Holy Ghost." [398] And this uniting the divine nature
   with the human, is expressly ascribed, not to the first, but to the
   second person. "For as much as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself took part of the same. For verily he took not on
   him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham."
   [399] Do not they speak not only without scripture, but contrary to it,
   who say that the first person of the Trinity became a Father by uniting
   the second person to the human nature, in the womb of the virgin Mary;
   by which the latter became the only begotten Son of the Father? That
   the relation of Father and Son began in the incarnation of Christ, and
   consists wholly in this? And do they by this supposition avoid any
   difficulty, and render the filiation of the Redeemer more consistent,
   intelligible, or honourable to him? Let the thoughtful, candid,
   discerning reader judge.

   IV. The Redeemer of man, who is God-man, the Son of God, sustains the
   character of Mediator between God and man. That such a person only is
   equal to this, to mediate between God and rebellious man, so as to
   effect a reconciliation, will be made evident when we proceed more
   particularly to consider the work of redemption, what is implied in it,
   and what was necessary in order to effect it. And it will also appear
   that he is every way qualified to sustain such an office and station,
   and in the best manner complete the arduous, the glorious work; and the
   character of this infinitely high, important, and wonderful personage
   will be more fully investigated and displayed in the sequel.

IMPROVEMENT.

   1. By attending as above, to the person and character of the Redeemer,
   we are in some measure prepared to see the folly of that pride which
   has led many to reject every thing in divine revelation which does not
   comport with their boasted reason, and is to them, dark and
   unintelligible; and to be sensible of the reasonableness and importance
   of modesty, humility and self diffidence; while we think and inquire
   concerning the being and character of God, and the Son of God, the
   Redeemer. Many by this pride, and trusting to what they call their own
   reason, have been led to renounce divine revelation, the only light and
   sure guide, in the high and important business of religion; and have
   plunged themselves into darkness and delusion. And others, though they
   profess to believe the Bible to be a revelation from God, reject the
   most essential and peculiar doctrines contained in it, on the account
   of which, men principally stand in need of a revelation from heaven.

   When we are once convinced, by undeniable, clear and abundant evidence,
   that the Bible contains a revelation from God; if we make a right use
   of our reason, we shall expect to find in it, declarations concerning
   God, his character and works, which are beyond our comprehension, and
   in this respect perfect mysteries to us; and that we shall not, at
   first, understand many things; yea, they may appear inconsistent and
   contradictory to us, which afterwards, by farther study and increase in
   the knowledge of divine things, we may understand, and see them to be
   plain and perfectly consistent. The things of God, or heavenly things,
   are so infinitely high, great and wonderful, that the greatest created,
   finite mind, falls infinitely short of fully comprehending all or any
   of them. The angels do not perfectly understand them. They may make
   swift advances in the knowledge of them, without end, and yet will
   forever fall infinitely short of reaching to their infinite height, so
   as to comprehend all. How ignorant and short sighted, then, must man be
   in those things, who not only has less natural capacity, but is sunk
   down in that moral depravity which is blindness itself, with respect to
   the things of the Spirit of God, and carries in the nature of it strong
   prejudices against them. How unreasonable, how arrogant, is it in him
   to imagine, that he can, by his own scanty, corrupted discerning, at
   once understand, and fully comprehend, all he needs to know and believe
   concerning God and heavenly things! Such a conceit, such pride and
   arrogance, can take place no where, but among such fallen, apostate
   creatures as mankind are; and serves to verify the ancient declaration,
   "Vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt."
   [400]

   If a philosopher should undertake to teach children of eight or ten
   years old, a system of philosophy, would he think himself well treated
   by them, if they were disposed to call in question the truth of every
   proposition of his, which they did not directly understand; and
   immediately conclude that every thing he delivered to them for truth,
   was inconsistent and absurd, which they were not able to reconcile? So
   long as they were of this disposition, they could receive no
   instruction from him. They would find many things perfectly dark and
   unintelligible to them, and others would appear to their narrow,
   childish conceptions, inconsistent and impossible. But the objects of
   natural philosophy are not so much above the understanding and capacity
   of these children, as heavenly things are above the understanding of
   men. There is an infinite difference; especially if we take into the
   account, man's moral depravity, which blinds him to the things of the
   Spirit of God.

   There are many things in natural philosophy, which men of the greatest
   capacities, and who have attended most to them, and made them their
   chief study, cannot understand; but remain unintelligible mysteries:
   Yea, there are propositions which appear to be inconsistent, and yet
   both of them must be received as true. For instance, it can be
   demonstrated that matter is infinitely divisible: And that matter is
   finite, is equally demonstrable; which two demonstrable propositions
   appear to be perfectly inconsistent.

   And shall we, to whom earthly things are, in so many instances,
   unintelligible, and appear inconsistent, imagine, that when God speaks
   to us of heavenly things, things infinitely great, high and wonderful,
   we are able to comprehend them all; and are warranted to reject every
   thing as not true, and not revealed to us by him, which we do not
   understand, or are not able to reconcile with each other!

   Let us rather become fools, that we may be wise. Sensible of our
   ignorance, and proneness to imbibe error, to love darkness rather than
   light; and put light for darkness, and darkness for light, let us study
   the Bible with a modest diffidence in our own reason and wisdom, and
   implicit confidence in our divine Instructor, looking to him to open
   our eyes to understand the scriptures, and behold the wonderful things
   revealed in those sacred oracles. "The meek will he guide in judgment;
   the meek will he teach his way." [401]

   II. This subject brings into view the infinite fulness and sufficiency
   of God. A fulness equal to the wants of sinners, and suited to relieve
   and save them. In order to this, he must be not only infinitely
   powerful, wise and good; but subsist in a manner, of which we could
   know nothing, had he not revealed it, viz. a Trinity in unity. And when
   revealed, it is infinitely above our comprehension. And if it were not
   so, we should have no reason to believe this was the true God: For the
   true God must be incomprehensible both in his existence and manner of
   subsistence. Had there not been a God subsisting in three persons, so
   distinct as to covenant with each other, and act a separate and
   distinct part in the work of redemption, man could not have been
   redeemed, and there could have been no Redeemer. They, therefore, who
   disbelieve the doctrine of the Trinity, and that the Redeemer is the
   second person in the Triune God, do really, though ignorantly, exclude
   the possibility of the redemption of man, and of a Redeemer equal to
   such a work; which will appear as we proceed in our inquiry into the
   work of redemption.

   But let us believe this revealed mystery, God the Son, manifest in the
   flesh, and adore, and rejoice in the infinite fulness and sufficiency
   of God, which appears in the person and character of the Redeemer, for
   the redemption of sinners: which fulness and sufficiency never could
   have been known to men or angels, had it not been revealed, and the
   redemption of man had not taken place.

   III. We are led by this subject, with wonder, gratitude and joy, to
   contemplate the ability and sufficiency of Jesus Christ to redeem
   sinners; and see that he is just such a Saviour as we need.

   Were he not a person of infinite greatness, dignity and worthiness,
   were he not God, his sufferings and obedience would have been of no
   avail to make atonement for the sins of men; to procure pardon, and
   merit eternal life for us. And were he not man, he could neither suffer
   nor obey. But being both these, he was equal to this. "Such an High
   Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
   sinners, and made higher than the heavens." [402] And were he not
   almighty, infinitely wise and good, he would not be able and willing to
   rescue sinners from the power of sin and satan, and completely sanctify
   them, and make them meet for the inheritance in heaven. But being all
   this, he is a complete Redeemer: "For it hath pleased the Father that
   in him all fulness should dwell. Who is made of God, unto his people,
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and complete
   redemption." [403] And all the redeemed must know and say, "Surely in
   the Lord have I righteousness and strength: In the Lord Jesus Christ
   shall the seed of Israel he justified and shall glory." [404]

   They who know their own state and character, as sinners, being wholly
   lost in sin, infinitely guilty and miserable; and believe in Christ,
   see all this in some degree. To such Christ is all-sufficient, most
   honourable and precious. But to them who are ignorant of themselves;
   the nature and ill desert of sin, and their own guilt and misery, who
   are unbelieving and disobedient, Jesus Christ, considered in his true
   character, is "a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence." [405]

   His sufficiency also includes his inexhaustible, unbounded fulness, as
   the glorious object of knowledge, contemplation and love, and of
   enjoyment and happiness. The redeemed will attend forever to their
   Redeemer, who is infinite, and whose person and character are full of
   wonders, with ever fresh and increasing delight. They will spring
   forward, in the full employ and strongest exertion of all their powers,
   and make swift progress in the knowledge of their Saviour, and in
   holiness and happiness, without ever coming to an end. Whatever wonders
   and glories they may have seen, and however high their love and
   happiness may be at any supposed future period, the Redeemer may with
   truth say to them as he did to Nathaniel, "Ye shall see greater things
   than these." St. Paul entered upon this endless, progressive and
   happifying knowledge of Christ, when he commenced a christian, and was
   admitted into the school of his Lord and Master; which he expresses in
   the following words. "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss
   for Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord: That I may know
   him," &c.

   IV. The view we have now had of the person and character of the
   Redeemer is suited to enlarge our ideas, and excite a sense of the
   infinite, wonderful condescension and love exercised and manifested in
   the work of redemption. The love of the Father is expressed in giving
   his only begotten, dear Son, to descend to such a low state of
   humiliation, of poverty, disgrace, and sufferings; even unto a most
   cruel death, to redeem man. And as this his own Son was equal to
   himself, and infinitely dear to him, the degree of love and goodness
   expressed in giving him up to redeem man, by suffering the curse under
   which he had fallen, must be infinite, and the greatest possible
   instance and exercise of disinterested benevolence, that can be
   conceived, or that ever did or can take place. And the more the
   greatness and dignity of the Son of God is known, and how dear he is to
   the Father, the greater will his sufferings appear to be, and the
   higher and more affecting will be the view and sense of the goodness of
   the Father, in giving up his Son to such sufferings. "God so loved the
   world that he gave his only begotten Son." Herein is love!

   And the condescension and love of Christ in his humiliation and
   sufferings for the redemption of men, appear in the most affecting and
   striking light, when we take into view his greatness and dignity, and
   the infinite height from which he descended, to such an amazing scene
   of debasement, ignominy and sufferings: And the more our ideas are
   enlarged in the view of the former, the greater sense shall we have of
   the latter. Hence it follows, that as his greatness, dignity and
   excellence are infinite, there is a foundation for increasing, endless
   views and admiration of "The love of Christ, which passeth knowledge."

   V. By considering the person of the Redeemer we are led to infer the
   height to which the redeemed are raised, the great honour which is
   conferred upon them, by their union to him. In the personal union of
   the human nature to the Son of God, the greatest honour is put upon it;
   and they who are united to this person as the redeemed are, rise to a
   degree of honour and exaltation, far above the angels, and unspeakably
   beyond all our present conceptions. They are the bride, the Lamb's
   wife, and share in all his honours and riches. They are "Raised up
   together with him, and made to sit together in heavenly places with
   Christ Jesus." [406] In his exaltation, they are exalted, as members of
   his body, of which he is the head; and shall sit with him, on his high
   throne, and reign with him forever. This honour have all the saints.

   VI. We may hence see the warrant we have to worship and pray to Jesus
   Christ, and call upon his name. We have seen that he is worshipped by
   all the inhabitants of heaven; that the apostles and primitive
   christians prayed to him, and called on his name: And there is the same
   reason why his people should do so in all ages, and at all times. He is
   God manifest in the flesh, Immanuel, God in our nature. He has all
   power in heaven and on earth; and is head over all things to the
   church. He can do all things for us that we want; why should we not ask
   him for what we want, and constantly pray to him, acknowledging our
   absolute dependence on him, and his sufficiency and ability to do all
   for us? And is not a neglect to do this putting a slight upon him?

   It will be asked, perhaps, whether this be not expressly forbidden by
   Christ, when he says, "In that day ye shall ask me nothing: Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,
   he will give it you." [407]

   Ans. When he says, "In that day ye shall ask me nothing," the word in
   the original is commonly used for asking questions. And not to make a
   petition. The disciples had been asking him a number of questions for
   their information about things which they did not understand. Christ
   tells them in these words, that after his ascension they should have no
   opportunity or occasion to ask him any questions; for they should then
   have sufficient knowledge by the holy Spirit teaching them ail things
   they should have need to know. When he says, "Whatsoever ye shall ask
   the Father," he uses another word for asking, which always signifies to
   make a petition.

   But from these last words there arises another question. Here Christ
   directs to ask the Father in his name. Is not this an implicit
   prohibition to ask any thing of him directly?

   Ans. This cannot be understood as a prohibition to pray to Jesus
   Christ, and call on his name, because the apostles and primitive
   christians did this, as has been shown. And perhaps, if the matter be
   properly considered, it will appear that praying directly to Jesus
   Christ, and asking him, is asking in his name, and asking the Father,
   as really, though not expressly, as when we ask the Father directly, in
   the name of Christ. Jesus Christ says, "I and my Father are one. What
   things soever the Father doth, these also doth the Son likewise." [408]
   He hath, and exerciseth all the power that is in heaven and earth. It
   hath pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell in him. And the
   Father says to wretched man, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him."
   Whatever you want, go to him for relief and a supply; as Pharaoh said
   to the starving people, "Go to Joseph." He then, who goes to Christ and
   asks the things which he wants of him, does really and in truth go to
   the Father, and asks of him, as he is the appointed governor and
   steward, and has all things in his hands. "The Father loveth the Son,
   and hath delivered all things into his hand. All things that the Father
   hath, are mine." [409] As the people by applying to Joseph, with whom
   all the authority and supplies u ere lodged, did really apply to
   Pharaoh; so they who apply to Christ and ask him, do really apply to
   the Father through him, and ask of the Father as really as if they
   expressly applied to him: For he and the Father are one, and what he
   does, the Father doth, and what the Father doth, the same doth the Son
   likewise. Therefore what our Saviour says in one passage the Father
   will do; in another he says, he himself will do the same. In the text
   under consideration he says, "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
   name, he will give it you." At another time he said, "Whatsoever ye
   shall ask in my name, that will I do." If ye shall ask any thing in my
   name, I will do it." [410] And we ask the Father in the name of Jesus
   Christ, when we go to Christ, and ask him; for in this way we approach
   to the Father, through him. We ask in the name of Christ, when we go
   immediately to Jesus Christ, and through him as a medium to the Father,
   as really and as much as if we apply expressly to the Father, and ask
   expressly in the name of Christ: For to ask in the name of Christ, is
   to rely on the atonement he has made, and on his merit and
   righteousness for the favour we ask. And this may be done when we apply
   immediately to Christ, as really and as much as if we apply expressly
   to the Father in his name.

   VII. This subject is suited to excite in our minds a conviction, and
   impress a sense of the amazing, infinite crime and folly of slighting
   and rejecting the Redeemer of men. The crime of this is great in
   proportion to the greatness, worthiness and excellence of this person,
   and his amazing condescension and goodness exercised and manifested in
   what he has done and suffered for man.

   And the folly of it is great, in proportion to the greatness of the
   evil from which he offers to deliver us; and of the good and happiness
   which he has obtained for man and invites him to accept, both of which
   are infinite. How unspeakably great then must be this wickedness and
   folly! They are to us as incomprehensible in their magnitude, as are
   the person and works of the Redeemer; they are truly boundless and
   infinite! They are attended with innumerable other aggravations, which
   far exceed our thought. How much more guilty are they who reject and
   cast contempt upon Christ, than they could have been, had there been no
   such person, no such Redeemer! And their endless punishment who persist
   in slighting him and neglecting this salvation, and die impenitent,
   will be inconceivably greater. They slight, they reject and despise
   God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and declare themselves to be
   irreconcileable enemies to him, while he is offering to be reconciled
   to them, to pardon their multiplied and infinitely aggravated offences,
   and bestow on them eternal life, in consequence of the Redeemer's
   undertaking in behalf of man, and obeying, and suffering unto death,
   for them. This serves to discover the universality, the exceeding
   greatness, and the malignity of the moral depravity of man. Jews and
   Gentiles acted this out, in the horrid action, never to be forgotten,
   in condemning and crucifying the Son of God, the Redeemer, when he was
   in their reach and power. And every man and woman who have lived since,
   and had opportunity to know the person and character of the Redeemer,
   have been guilty of the same crime, in a greater or less degree; as we
   have all slighted and abused him more or less; and so have, in this
   way, in some measure at least, joined with them who put him to death.

   shews how the denial of the former tends, another way, to the rejection
   of the latter. For if the former be rejected, because it is
   incomprehensible, and appears inconsistent, it may be expected that
   when the doctrine of the Trinity is more particularly considered, it
   will appear equally unintelligible; and therefore be rejected, for the
   same reason. Is it not probable, that Sabellius, the ancient
   Antitrinitarian, was in this way led to give up the doctrine of the

CHAP. III.

  CONCERNING THE DESIGN AND WORK OF THE REDEEMER.

   THIS is a subject upon which professing christians are far from being
   agreed. They differ in opinion respecting it, according to their
   different views of the moral state and character of man; from what he
   is to be redeemed; and of what is necessary to be done or suffered in
   order to his redemption. And this lays the foundation of their
   difference of opinion respecting the person and character of the
   Redeemer. For he must be answerable to the state of man, and to that
   which must be done or suffered in order to his being delivered from sin
   and misery, and made completely happy forever consistent with the
   divine law, and the wisdom and honour of the moral Governor of man.

   There are not a few in the christian world who entertain such ideas of
   God, his law and moral government; of the character of man, and the
   nature and crime of sin, that they see no need of a Mediator and
   Redeemer, in order to the pardon and salvation of men: And therefore
   consider Jesus Christ as an impostor, and all who believe in him as
   deluded; and wholly discard divine revelation, and plunge into the
   darkness of Deism.

   The Jews are so ignorant of the nature of the moral law, and their own
   state, that they think they stand in need of no Redeemer, but one who
   shall deliver them from the power and oppression of man, and bestow on
   them temporal, worldly dominion, prosperity and happiness. They
   therefore reject Jesus Christ, and hope for the deliverance they
   desire, by their expected Messiah.

   There are many professing christians, who have much the same sentiments
   respecting God, law, sin, and the moral state of man, with Jews and
   deists; and consequently, though they profess to believe that Jesus
   Christ is the Saviour of men, they see no need of a Saviour that is
   more than a man, or a mere creature; and therefore do not believe in
   his divinity.

   Others have such views of God, his law and moral government, of the
   character and state of man in his apostasy, and of what is necessary to
   be done and suffered in order to their redemption, that they feel the
   need of a divine Redeemer; whose person and character has been
   described in the foregoing chapter, and which they are prepared to see
   plainly exhibited in the Bible.

   From this view, it appears that in order to understand the work of the
   Redeemer, the design of his undertaking, and what he does effect, mc
   must have right views of the law of God which man has transgressed; and
   of the state into which he is fallen by this rebellion.

   The law of God points out the duty of man, and requires of him what is
   perfectly right, and no more, or less. It cannot therefore be altered
   in the least degree, so as to require more or less, without rendering
   it less perfect and good. It is therefore an eternal unalterable rule
   of righteousness, which cannot be abrogated or altered in the least
   iota, by an infinitely perfect, unchangeable legislator and governor,
   consistent with his character, his perfect rectitude and righteousness.
   This law necessarily implies, as essential to it, a sanction or
   penalty, consisting in evil, or a punishment, which is in exact
   proportion to the magnitude of the crime of transgressing it; or the
   desert of the transgressor, which is threatened to be executed on the
   offender. This penalty which is threatened must be no more, nor less,
   than the sinner deserves, or the demerit of the crime. The least
   deviation from this would render the law so far imperfect, and wrong.
   Every creature under this law is under infinite obligations to obey it
   without any deviation from it in the least possible instance, through
   the whole of his existence; and every instance of rebellion tends to
   infinite evil, to break up the divine government, and bring ruin and
   misery on all the moral world: Therefore every transgression of this
   law, or neglect to obey it, deserves infinite evil as the proper
   punishment of it. Consequently this evil, this punishment, must be the
   threatened penalty of the law; which has been shown in a former
   chapter.

   Man by transgression has incurred the penalty of this law, and fallen
   under the curse of it; "For it is written, cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all the things which are written in the book of the
   law to do them." [411] This curse cannot be taken off, and man
   released, until it has its effect, and all the evil implied in it be
   suffered, which man can never do, so as to be delivered from it, or
   from suffering, because a finite creature is not capable of suffering
   the evil contained in the curse in any limited duration; and therefore
   his sufferings must be without end, or everlasting. And no future
   obedience, should man repent and live perfectly obedient after he had
   transgressed, would atone for his sin, or remove the curse in the least
   degree, according to law: for his obedience, though ever so perfect,
   and continued ever so long, would be no more than what he constantly
   owed, and therefore no more than his duty, had he never transgressed.
   Thus man by sin fell into an irrecoverably lost state, and brought the
   curse of the law of God upon him, from which it is impossible he should
   deliver himself, or be delivered, consistent with this law, either by
   all possible sufferings or obedience of his own.

   This is the law of God, and is the voice of God to man, and is an
   unalterable expression of his heart, or moral character and perfection.
   It therefore cannot be altered or abated in the requirements of it, or
   in the threatening. It is as unchangeable as the divine character
   itself, being founded on the eternal, unchangeable reason and nature of
   things. And it is not consistent with the truth of God not to execute
   the threatening of his law: For this would not only be giving up and
   making void his law; but acting contrary to his own declaration. Divine
   threatenings are predictions, declaring what shall be, and what God
   will do in case of transgression of his law. And it is as inconsistent
   with truth not to execute his threatening, in the true meaning of it,
   as it is not to accomplish and bring to pass, what he has declared and
   promised shall take place. This law therefore must be maintained in the
   true meaning and spirit of it; as the grand and only perfect rule of
   rectoral justice, rectitude, or righteousness. And if it were possible
   that God should do any thing in his conduct towards moral agents, which
   should be inconsistent with this his law, or express the least
   disregard of it, it would be infinitely wrong, and contrary to truth,
   rectitude and righteousness, wisdom, and goodness. For this would be
   injurious to himself, and to his moral kingdom, and subversive of the
   greatest general good. Therefore if man could not be redeemed and saved
   consistent with maintaining this law, and showing the highest regard to
   it, God could not be true, just, wise or good, in saving them or
   showing them any favour.

   But to pardon man and restore him to favour and happiness, in this
   situation, and remove the curse which the divine law fastens upon him,
   would be acting contrary to this law, repealing and renouncing it as a
   rule of righteousness, as not good and right: It would be joining with
   the sinner to disregard and dishonour the law; and favour, justify and
   encourage rebellion. This therefore would be inconsistent with
   rectitude, righteousness, wisdom and goodness, and infinitely contrary
   to these, and would put an eternal end to all perfect moral government.
   It would dethrone the Governor of the world, destroy his kingdom, and
   give full scope to the reign of rebellion, confusion and misery
   forever. Therefore it were better, infinitely better, that rebel man,
   even all mankind, should have the curse of the law fully executed on
   them, and they be totally miserable forever, than that this infinitely
   greater evil should take place by shewing favour to him, contrary to
   the dictates of the most perfect, righteous, and infinitely sacred law
   of God.

   This otherwise insuperable difficulty, this mighty bar and obstacle in
   the way of shewing any favour to man, and escaping eternal destruction,
   is the ground of the necessity of a Mediator and Redeemer, by whom it
   maybe wholly removed, and man be delivered from die curse of the law;
   and saved, consistent with the divine character, with truth, infinite
   rectitude, wisdom and goodness; and so as not to set aside and
   dishonour, but support and maintain the divine law and government. This
   is the light in which the scripture very expressly sets this matter.
   St. Paul, speaking of the pardon and salvation of man by Christ the
   Redeemer, says, "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through
   faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
   sins that are past: To declare, I say, his righteousness: That he might
   be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus." [412] Here
   the design of the Redeemer is expressed, and the great thing he is to
   accomplish is to maintain and declare the righteousness, the rectitude,
   and unchangeable truth and perfection of God in opening a way by his
   blood, his sufferings unto death, for the free pardon of sinful man,
   consistent with his rectoral justice and truth, and doing that which is
   right and just both with respect to himself, his law and government,
   and all the subjects of his kingdom.

   The work of the Redeemer therefore has a primary respect to the law of
   God, to maintain and honour that, so that sinners may be pardoned and
   saved consistent with that, without setting that aside, or showing the
   least disregard to it, in the requirements and threatenings of it; but
   that it may be perfectly fulfilled; and especially that the threatening
   might be properly and completely executed, without which God could not
   be true or just in pardoning and saving the sinner. It was therefore
   predicted that he should "Magnify the law, and make it honourable."
   [413] And Christ himself declares that he came into the world to fulfil
   the law. "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets:
   I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you.
   Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
   from the law, till all be fulfilled." [414] The law could not be
   fulfilled by Jesus Christ without his suffering the penalty of it, and
   obeying it perfectly. For to give up the penalty, and not execute the
   threatening of the law, when it is transgressed, is to dissolve and
   destroy the law: For a penalty is essential to a law, and where there
   is no penalty threatened there is no law, as has been shown. Therefore
   had the Redeemer undertaken to save man, without regard to the penalty
   of the law and suffering it himself, he would have come to make void
   the law and destroy it, to all intents and purposes. He could not "make
   reconciliation for sin, and bring in everlasting righteousness," which
   it was predicted he should, [415] without suffering the penalty of the
   law, the everlasting rule of righteousness. In doing this his love of
   righteousness and hatred of iniquity was exercised and displayed in the
   most signal manner, and to the highest degree. Therefore it is with
   respect to this regard which he paid to the divine law in suffering the
   penalty and obeying the precepts of it, that it is said to him, "Thou
   hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy
   God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
   [416] The same is expressed in other words by St. Paul. "And being
   found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto
   deaths even the death of the cross. Wherefore God hath highly exalted
   him, and given him a name which is above every name." [417] His being
   obedient unto death, strongly expresses his laying down his life for
   sinners, suffering and dying in their stead, agreeable to the
   particular command which he had received of his Father. [418] To this
   end he was "made under the law, to redeem them that were under the
   law." [419] Sinful men were under the curse of the law; and in order to
   redeem them, the Redeemer must take their place under the law, and
   suffer the penalty, bear the curse for them, and in their room, which
   is expressed yet more fully, and in the most plain and unequivocal
   words in the preceding chapter. "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
   of the law, being made a curse for us." By being made a curse for us,
   can be nothing else but suffering the penalty, the curse of the law,
   under which we were, and which man must have suffered, had not the
   Redeemer suffered it for him, as he could not be redeemed in any other
   way, without destroying the law.

   From this general view of the design and work of the Redeemer of man,
   taken from the holy scriptures, the way is prepared for a farther
   stating and explanation of this subject, under the following
   particulars.

   I. One important and necessary part of the work of the Redeemer of man,
   was to make atonement for their sins, by suffering in his own person
   the penalty or curse of the law, under which, by transgression, they
   had fallen; so that sinners might be pardoned and saved, consistent
   with the divine law, and without the least respect to that, or in any
   degree making it void; but so as to establish and honour the law.

   There is no truth in the Bible more clearly and abundantly revealed
   than this. This truth is evident from what has been above observed from
   the scriptures; but it is proper more particularly to attend to the
   scripture representation of this important subject.

   The institution of sacrifices of beasts and other animals, after the
   apostasy of man, and the declaration, that redemption should take place
   by the seed of the woman; and those more expressly appointed under the
   Mosaic dispensation, do all, more or less, illustrate and confirm this
   truth, and point out vicarious sufferings as necessary and effectual to
   make atonement for sin. The guilty person was ordered to bring the
   beast to the altar, and lay his hands on the head of it, and confess
   his sin; and then it was put to death and sacrificed on the altar by
   the priest, instead of the sinner, and he was forgiven, an atonement
   being made for his sin by the death and blood of the beast. [420] These
   sacrifices were of various kinds, and offered on different occasions,
   as types of Christ, and those things which related to him, and the
   atonement he was to make. For all these sacrifices were designed types
   of Christ, and in this all their worth and efficacy consisted. The
   death and blood of a beast could not in any measure or degree make
   atonement for sin, and was of no avail any farther than it had respect
   to Christ, and was a type and figure of his death, of his blood which
   he shed, which was the only real atonement, and which alone avails to
   take away sin. "For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of
   goats should take away sins." It was therefore in early times expressly
   declared, that sacrifices and offerings were not desirable, or of any
   worth, in themselves considered, and that God did not institute and
   require them for their own sake, as making any real atonement for sin;
   but that this should be made by an incarnate Redeemer, to whom they
   pointed as types and shadows of him. [421]

   And he is particularly pointed out by Isaiah, as making atonement for
   sin by suffering the evil which it deserves in the room of sinners, and
   for them, that they might escape punishment, and be pardoned. He says,
   "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his
   stripes we are healed. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
   all. He was cut off out of the land of the living: For the
   transgression of my people was he stricken. It pleased the Lord to
   bruise him. He hath put him to grief: When thou shalt make his soul an
   offering for sin, he shall see his seed. By his knowledge shall my
   righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. He
   poured out his soul unto death, and he bare the sin of many." [422] To
   bear sin, or iniquity, is to suffer the punishment of it, or the evil
   which it deserves, and with which it is threatened. This appears not
   only from the plain, natural import of the phrases, but from the use of
   it in the Bible, of which there are many instances. The following are a
   few of them. "The holy garments shall be upon Aaron and his sons, when
   they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place, that they
   bear not iniquity and die." [423] "They shall therefore keep mine
   ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefor, if they profane
   it." [424] Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
   tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die." [425] The
   apostles express the import of the sufferings and death of Christ by
   the same phrase. "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many."
   [426] "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree."
   [427]

   In the epistle to the Hebrews, the typical meaning of sacrifices of
   beasts is explained, and declared to be designed to point out the
   sacrifice and atonement which Christ has made, when he offered himself
   once for all, as a sacrifice to put away sin, and bear the sins of
   many; the plain meaning of which is, that he, by his sufferings, took
   on him the penalty of sin, and bore the punishment of it, so as
   effectually to put it away from all who believe in him, that it may
   never be laid to their charge, to condemn them: he having made full
   atonement and reconciliation. In this sense he is said to be the
   propitiation for the sins of men. And men are said to obtain redemption
   and forgiveness of sins by or through his blood, in allusion to the
   blood of the sacrifices under the law, which was the most essential
   thing in them, and is said to make the atonement. "The life of the
   flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar, to
   make an atonement for your souls: For it is the blood that maketh
   atonement for the soul." [428] Our Saviour says of the sacramental cup,
   when he instituted the Lord's supper, "This is my blood of the New
   Testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins." [429]
   Agreeable to this, St. Paul says, "We are justified by his blood."
   [430] In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins." [431] And St. John says, "the blood of Christ cleanseth us,
   (that is, christians) from all sins." [432] St. Peter tells believers
   that they were "redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
   without blemish, and without spot." [433] In heaven the saved adore the
   Redeemer and say, "Thou art worthy, &c. For thou wast slain, and hast
   redeemed us to God by thy blood." [434]

   There are a multitude of passages in the New Testament which set this
   point in this same light, and clearly import that what Christ suffered
   was in man's stead, and does avail to release all who believe in him,
   from suffering the penalty of the law; and that by this alone they are
   redeemed from the curse of the law, which is eternal destruction. These
   passages are too many to be particularly quoted. Only a few therefore
   will be mentioned. Christ says, "The Son of man came not to be
   ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
   many." [435] He redeems or ransoms them by giving his life, his
   suffering unto death; this is the price, the ground of their
   deliverance. St. Paul says to believers, "Ye are bought with a price."
   [436] The word in the original, which is here translated bought, is the
   same with that in Rev. v. 9. which is translated redeemed. "Thou hast
   redeemed us to God by thy blood." The price by which men are bought,
   and redeemed from the curse of the law, from endless destruction, is
   the blood of Christ, which he shed for the remission of sins, that is,
   his suffering unto death. The death of Christ, and the blood of Christ,
   mean the same thing. In shedding his blood and dying, he was made a
   curse, by which he has bought, redeemed, and delivered his people from
   the curse of the law. His life was the ransom he gave, the price which
   he paid for our redemption. Therefore the death of Christ is mentioned
   as that by which alone believers are delivered from condemnation, the
   condemning sentence, the curse of the law. "Who is he that condemneth?
   It is Christ that died." [437] "For when we were without strength, in
   due time Christ died for the ungodly." [438] "I delivered unto you
   first of all, that which I also received, how that Christ died for our
   sins." [439] "For that he died, he died unto sin [or for sin] once."
   [440] "And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that
   by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were
   under the first Testament, &c." [441] In these passages, and other
   similar ones, the death of Christ is represented as having respect to
   the sins of men, and as redeeming them from the curse which sin
   deserves, by taking the curse on himself. When it is said "Christ died
   for our sins," the meaning must be that his death is the atonement and
   propitiation for sin; and that by it he suffered the evil with which
   sin is threatened in the law, or the penalty and curse of the law; or
   that which is equivalent. To suffer for sin and for the sinner, is so
   far to take place of the sinner, as to suffer the evil which he
   deserves, and which otherwise the sinner must have suffered. Or, which
   is the same, the sufferings of Christ answer the same end with respect
   to law, and divine government, that otherwise must be answered by the
   eternal destruction of the sinner. The same sentiment is strongly
   expressed by St. Peter. "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins,
   the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." [442] Here it
   is to be observed, that three things are asserted in this sentence.

   1. That the sufferings of Christ make atonement, and are the only
   ground or means of the sinner's reconciliation to God.

   2. That the sufferings of Christ were therefore for sin, and
   consequently must be the evil which sin deserves, and that to which the
   sinner was exposed, and which he must have suffered, had not Christ
   suffered it in his stead, or that which is equivalent.

   3. That the last clause, "That he might bring us to God," respects the
   pardon of sinners, their deliverance from the curse of the law, and
   restoration to favour, which could not take place consistent with the
   holy righteous law of God, had not Christ suffered for their sin.

   On the whole, The scripture represents the atonement which Christ has
   made, by which sinners are delivered from the curse of the law, the
   wrath to come, to consist wholly in his suffering unto death for their
   sins, by which he suffered the evil which the law threatens for sin, or
   a complete equivalent, so as fully to answer the end of the threatening
   of the law, and all the purposes of moral government, consistent with
   the pardon of the sinner, as much as if the curse had been executed on
   the transgressor: And that this was one great, and the most important,
   essential and difficult part of the work of the Redeemer, and really
   implies the whole.

   Thus by the death, the blood of Christ, full atonement is made for sin;
   the curse of the law is executed on the Redeemer, by which he has
   bought, redeemed his people from the curse, and opened the way for
   their pardon and complete redemption. He has been made a curse that he
   might deliver all who believe in him from the curse; but not so as in
   the least degree to remove their unworthiness and ill desert, but this
   remains, and will remain forever, it being improper, undesirable, and
   impossible that this should be removed, or that they should ever cease
   to deserve eternal destruction. They remain, and must continue to be as
   criminal as ever they were; so long as it remains true that they have
   been guilty of crimes which are pardoned, and from which they are
   justified by the blood of Christ.

   In order more fully to explain and establish the atonement of Christ,
   which he has made by his suffering unto death, as it has been
   represented from the holy scripture; and to obviate as far as possible,
   every difficulty and objection which may arise in the minds of any, it
   is proper and necessary to consider the following questions.

   Question 1. Where is the justice of an innocent person suffering for
   the guilty, and, on that account, delivering the criminal from the
   sufferings which he deserves? How can such a procedure honour the law,
   and support government?

   Answer l. The scripture states the matter so, and abundantly asserts,
   that Christ, though perfectly innocent and holy himself, did die for
   sinners, and in their behalf; that he suffered, the just for the
   unjust; and that by this, all who believe in him are delivered from the
   evil, the suffering, which they deserve, and saved forever. Therefore
   every objection to this, is equally an objection to the Bible. Let
   deists object, and triumph in the imagination that it is unanswerable;
   but let christians believe, and with care and honest meekness consider,
   whether this supposed difficulty may not be easily removed.

   Answer 2. Can it be reasonably asserted; is it true, that an innocent,
   worthy person may not justly, and with the utmost propriety, suffer in
   the room of a criminal, in order to save the latter from suffering, in
   any case whatsoever? Is not the contrary true, and agreeable to the
   common sense of mankind? Benevolus sustained the best and most worthy
   character of any man in the kingdom. His wife was publicly guilty of a
   crime, for which the law of the state denounced a punishment, which she
   could not suffer and survive it; but it must prove fatal to her, if
   inflicted on her. The law was so good and important, that if the
   penalty were not inflicted, and the law were disregarded in favour of
   the criminal, the consequence would be most fatal to the kingdom, and
   sap the foundation of all authority, law and government, and introduce
   endless confusion and misery. The husband saw all this, and had rather
   his wife should suffer the extremity of the law, than that good
   government should be dissolved, or the law disregarded, which he loved,
   and wished to have maintained. He loved his wife so much, that he was
   willing to suffer the penalty of the law himself, if she might by this
   means escape it. He knew that he was able to go through this suffering,
   however dreadful, and survive it; and that his doing this in the sight
   of the whole kingdom, would do more honour to the law, and government
   would be better established and maintained, than if his wife should
   suffer as she deserved. He therefore stepped forward, and offered, and
   desired to take the evil upon himself, and suffer the penalty of the
   law in the room of his wife, and for her crime. His offer was accepted,
   and he suffered the whole, without the least mitigation.

   All the inhabitants and good subjects in the kingdom looked on and had
   not a thought of any injustice done to him, who offered to suffer for
   his wife; and did actually suffer the evil which she deserved. They saw
   and admired his benevolence and goodness to his wife, and his
   disposition and zeal to maintain the law and government. They beheld,
   and were highly pleased with the uprightness, rectitude and
   righteousness of their king, and his fixed determination to maintain
   his law, while he inflicted the penalty of it on a person whom he
   esteemed and loved above all others in his kingdom, when he stood in
   the place of the transgressor: And a greater discovery was made of
   this, and his high displeasure at rebellion, than if the criminal
   herself had been punished. They were struck with the propriety,
   righteousness, wisdom and goodness, exercised and manifested in the
   whole affair, and ever after had a more clear apprehension, and greater
   sense of the sacredness, importance, and excellence of the law, and of
   the unreasonableness and magnitude of the crime of transgressing it;
   and loved and revered their king, and his law and government, more than
   ever they had done before.

   The husband and wife were unspeakably more happy in each other, than
   they were before, or than they could have been, had not all this taken
   place. Their mutual love was stronger and more sweet and happy. She saw
   more of his worthiness, excellence and love, than she could otherwise
   have done, and was most happy and swallowed up in the sweetest exercise
   of gratitude, and the most endearing affection, which knew no bounds or
   end.

   There were some indeed, who never had been cordial friends to the king;
   and had no great esteem of his laws or government, or of the husband;
   who thought the transgression of the wife small and trivial; which
   might and ought to have been forgiven, without all this ado, and
   suffering of the husband. They were disaffected, and offended with the
   whole transaction, and made innumerable and endless objections.

   This story may serve, in some measure, to illustrate this point, as
   well as some others, which will come into view hereafter; and to shew
   that an innocent, and most worthy person, may suffer for the crimes of
   the guilty, and yet no injustice be done to the sufferer; and the
   criminal may be by this, delivered from suffering what he deserves, and
   yet the law which he has transgressed, be well supported and honoured.

   The Redeemer voluntarily took the place of sinners; he chose to suffer
   in their stead. His language was, "Then said I, Lo, I come. In the
   volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my
   God; Yea, thy law is within my heart." [443] "I lay down my life for
   the sheep. No man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of myself."
   [444] "Being in the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal
   with God; yet made himself of no reputation; and took upon him the form
   of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in
   fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
   even the death of the cross." [445] He suffered in the sight of all the
   moral world, and the design of his suffering was, and still is publicly
   declared and known, and that it was his choice thus to bear the evil
   which sinners deserved, that he might by this redeem them from it. And
   this is so far from being unjust or improper, that the righteousness
   and wisdom of God are hereby manifested and declared.

   Quest. 2. The curse of the law dooms the sinner to be given up to the
   dominion of sin, and spiritual death without end: How then could Christ
   suffer the curse of the law, who knew no sin?

   Ans. The curse of the law is the evil, the punishment of sin, and not
   sin, which is the cause of suffering: the crime itself which is
   threatened and punished. What is threatened as the penalty of the law,
   is natural evil, or pain and suffering for transgression, or moral
   evil. Spiritual death is moral evil; sin, the transgression of the law;
   for this the penalty is threatened and inflicted, and is not the
   penalty itself. This consists wholly in natural evil, pain and
   suffering; and not in actually violating the law. It is true, that
   being dead in trespasses and sins, or endless continuance under the
   power and dominion of sin, is implied in the sinner's suffering the
   penalty of the law; but this is not the penalty, or any part of it, but
   the natural evil which attends it, and of which it is the occasion. The
   Mediator did not suffer precisely the same kind of pain, in all
   respects, which the sinner suffers when the curse is executed on him:
   He did not suffer that particular kind of pain which is the necessary
   attendant, or natural consequence of being a sinner, and which none but
   the sinner himself can suffer. But this is only a circumstance of the
   punishment of sin, and not of the essence of it. The whole penalty of
   the law may be suffered, and the evil suffered may be as much, and as
   great, without suffering that particular sort of pain. Therefore
   Christ, though with» out sin, might suffer the whole penalty, that is,
   as much and as great evil, as the law denounces against transgression.
   The evil which sinners may suffer, on whom the penalty of the law is
   inflicted, may, and doubtless will, differ in many circumstances, and
   not be precisely of the same kind, in all respects; and yet each one of
   them suffer the penalty of the same law.

   Quest. 3. How can the sufferings of Christ be suffering the curse of
   the law, or the evil which the law threatens, or so great an evil as
   the eternal destruction of the sinner, and of millions of them, since
   his sufferings were of a short duration, and were not, perhaps, equal
   in degree, to those which some one of the damned suffers every hour?

   Ans. The magnitude of the sufferings of Christ, or the evil of his
   suffering as he did, docs not wholly consist in the quantity or degree
   of pain which he endured, or in the duration or length of time in which
   he suffered. The degree of pain which he suffered was very great;
   unspeakably greater, no doubt, than ever was, or can be suffered by any
   mere creature. He did not suffer in the least in his divine nature; but
   altogether in his human nature, but this was capable of suffering an
   unspeakably greater degree of pain, than any mere creature, not only by
   reason of the superior greatness of the human nature, which has been
   mentioned; but from the perfect union with the divine nature. A
   consciousness of this, and of the dignity and worthiness implied in it,
   must aggravate his suffering far beyond conception. And by this union
   the human nature was sustained and made capable of enduring a degree of
   sufferings far beyond, and much more dreadful, than what any mere
   creature is capable of bearing. But, as has been observed, the
   greatness of the evil of the sufferings of Christ, does not wholly, or
   chiefly consist in the degree of pain which he suffered, or in the
   duration of his suffering: But in the greatness, dignity, and
   worthiness of the person who suffered.

   The greatness of the evil, in the sufferings and reproach, and disgrace
   of any person, does not consist merely in the degree of pain which he
   suffers; but it is the greater or less, according to the excellence and
   worth of the person who suffers. This is so in the estimation of all,
   who attend to the matter, and is agreeable, to the common sense and
   feelings of mankind. It is a greater evil for the excellent head of a
   family to be condemned, reproached, and spit upon, tortured in the most
   cruel manner, and put to death, by the servants of the family, than it
   would be to have one of the servants treated so, and suffer all this.
   It would certainly be so to the children of the family, who esteemed
   and loved their father, being sensible of his excellence and worth; and
   it would be judged so by all. If the general of an army, who had
   supported his station and character with the greatest dignity and
   honour, and who is the life and support of his army, should be made the
   object of reproach and contempt by his soldiers, and dragged through
   the ranks in a most ignominious manner, to the place of execution, and
   there put to death for a coward and traitor: This would be an
   unspeakably greater evil, than it would be for a private sentinel to
   suffer all this pain and disgrace.

   If a king who had long maintained a most righteous, wise and good
   government, and made a nation happy, being a person of the greatest
   excellence and true greatness and dignity, and sustaining the best
   character in the world, should be taken from his throne, by a number of
   banditti, and openly scourged through the streets of the city, and cast
   into prison; and then be taken from thence, and publicly put to a most
   cruel death; this would be a much greater evil, more undesirable and
   grievous, than for one of the lowest of his subjects to suffer all this
   reproach and pain. There is need only to mention these instances, in
   order to gain the assent of every one who will attend to the truth
   which is asserted, without any long train of reasoning upon it. It
   seems to be self evident; an irresistible dictate of common sense.

   Should such a king have a son of a most amiable and excellent
   character, having the greatest natural abilities, and being endowed
   with great wisdom and benevolence, beloved and honoured by all the
   virtuous, and justly dearer to his father than any other person: And
   this son should fall into the hands of a number of ruffians, who after
   they had joined to reproach, ridicule, and mock him, should put him to
   the most ignominious and cruel death that they could invent: Would not
   this be with the highest reason, beyond expression, a greater evil, and
   more grievous to the father, and all the inhabitants of that kingdom,
   than if the worthless servant in his family were treated thus, and
   suffered all this contempt and pain? It is presumed every one to whom
   such a case is proposed, will answer in the affirmative. And this is
   granting what most certainly none can deny, viz. That the more
   excellent and honourable any person is, and the more he is justly
   esteemed and beloved, and the greater his worth and importance, the
   greater and more grievous is the evil, in his unjustly suffering
   reproach and pain; and that the evil of such suffering, is great, in
   proportion to the excellence, dignity, worth and importance of the
   person who suffers.

   From this truth, which is so evident and certain, it follows, as an
   undeniable consequence, that for the Redeemer to suffer as he did, is
   an infinite evil. For, as has been shewn, he is a person of infinite
   greatness, dignity, excellence, worth and importance; and infinitely
   beloved and dear to the Father. To the Father who sees all things as
   they are, and most perfectly comprehends the infinite excellence,
   dignity and worth of his infinitely well beloved and only begotten Son,
   it must appear an infinite evil for him to suffer what he did for the
   redemption of sinners. And in the sight of the Son, he undertook to
   suffer infinite evil, when he came into the world. And to the redeemed,
   as they grow in a view and sense of the greatness, dignity and worth of
   their Redeemer, and know more and better who he is, who died on the
   cross to redeem them, the greater will the evil of his sufferings
   appear; and consequently, the more clearly will they see the greatness
   of the price by which they were bought, and the sufficiency of his
   blood to cleanse from all sin, and how perfectly the threatening of the
   law is answered in the sufferings of Christ. [446]

   The evil of the sufferings of Christ, being in the magnitude of it
   commensurate with the dignity and worth of his person, is equal to, is
   as great as the evil which is threatened to the transgressors of the
   law, and as great as the sinner deserves; yea, it is as great as the
   endless sufferings of all mankind; for that is no more than infinite;
   therefore Christ by his sufferings, paid a price, and made an atonement
   sufficient to redeem the whole world from the wrath to come: And it is
   not owing to any want or defect in this, that all are not saved; for it
   is boundless; but this is owing to something else, which will be
   considered in the sequel.

   Thus it appears that though sin be an infinite evil, and deserves
   infinite natural evil, which is the penalty of the law of God, and the
   threatened punishment of sin, yet it could be suffered by Christ in a
   limited duration, a short time, since the evil of his suffering as he
   did must be great in proportion to the greatness, dignity, and
   worthiness of the sufferer, which are infinite.

   If it should be asked, how the sufferings of Christ can be considered
   as an infinite evil, since he is not less, but more happy and glorious,
   and will be so forever, than if he had not suffered; and the good which
   comes to his church and kingdom by his suffering, is, and will be so
   great, as to overbalance and swallow up all the evil? This may be
   answered by observing,

   1. If there be any thing in this argument, and the evil of suffering be
   not so great, but less, in proportion to the greatness of good of which
   it is the occasion; then it will follow, that there is no evil at all
   in the suffering of Christ; because it is the occasion of overbalancing
   good, and of much more good, on the whole, than if he had not suffered.
   If every degree of good which is the consequence of suffering, and of
   which suffering is the occasion, does cancel one degree of the evil of
   suffering, and render it no evil; then the overbalancing good,
   occasioned by suffering, cancels all the evil of the suffering, and
   renders it no evil: Which it is supposed none will admit; for all will
   grant there is some degree of evil, at least, in the sufferings of
   Christ.

   2. The evil of suffering is not the less, in itself considered, however
   great be the good of which the pain and suffering is the occasion.
   Therefore the evil of the sufferings of Christ is as great, as if they
   had been the occasion of no good, but of evil. We must determine what
   evil there was in the suffering of Christ, not by taking into view the
   consequences of his suffering, but by considering the suffering itself,
   and the person suffering; and if the evil appears to be infinitely
   great, thus considered, as it has been proved it does, then, whatever
   be the consequence of the evil suffered, and however great the good be
   of which it is the occasion, it alters not the magnitude of the evil
   suffered; but it must remain eternally the same, in itself considered.

   It is granted, and has been proved, in a former chapter, that no evil
   has taken place in the universe, or ever will, that is not the occasion
   of an overbalancing good; so that, on the whole, there is more good
   than if there had been no evil: And in this sense, all evil is turned
   into good, that is, it is on the whole, all things considered, not
   evil, but good. But it does not follow from this, that there is nothing
   of the nature of evil, or no evil, considered in and by itself: There
   is, notwithstanding, in this view of it, infinite evil.

   If the overbalancing good, of which evil is the occasion, cancels the
   evil, in itself considered, then the damned suffer no evil; for all
   their sufferings are the occasion of an overbalancing good. The
   querist, therefore, may as well ask, how eternal damnation can be an
   infinite evil, or any evil at all, since it is the occasion of an
   overbalancing good? And he may with equal reason assert, that Joseph
   suffered no evil by being sold a slave into Egypt, and east into prison
   there, "whose feet they hurt with fetters, and he was laid in iron,"
   and say there was no evil in all this, since God meant it for good; and
   it was the occasion of so much good to Joseph himself, and to his
   father's house. Ask Joseph. Ask his father. Ask common sense.

   Quest. 4. If Christ suffered as great, and as much evil, yea, more than
   the redeemed would have suffered, had they not been redeemed, but been
   miserable forever; then there is no less evil in the universe, than
   there would be, if they had not been redeemed; but really much more.
   Where is the advantage then of redemption, and what is gained by it?

   Ans. The advantage gained by redemption, to the universe, is the
   overbalancing good which is produced by it. AH natural evil is, in
   itself considered, undesirable, and cannot be desired for its own sake;
   but may be desired and chosen, for the sake of the good of which it is
   the occasion, and which cannot take place in any other way. It would
   have been undesirable that there should be evil in the universe, and
   therefore there would have been none, had it not been necessary in
   order to a greater, overbalancing good: But it is desirable that every
   instance and degree of evil, which is necessary to promote the greatest
   good, should take place, however much and great this be. The suffering
   and death of the Redeemer is in itself an infinite evil; but as this
   was necessary in order to effect a proportionably greater,
   overbalancing, superabounding good, it was desirable it should take
   place; for the sake of "the glory that should follow." This event is of
   infinite advantage to the universe. God is glorified more by the
   redemption of man than by all his other works, and there will be an
   eternal, bright, and most happifying display of the divine perfections,
   which could not have taken place, had not Christ thus suffered. Had he
   not suffered as he did, he would not have entered into his glory, that
   glory and felicity which he will enjoy forever as the fruit of his
   suffering. And an eternal, glorious and most happy kingdom exists in
   consequence of this. Thus not only the salvation of the redeemed from
   eternal destruction is effected by the suffering of the Redeemer, but
   they are eternally happy; and not only so, but they and all holy beings
   will be unspeakably more happy forever, than they could otherwise have
   been; and God and the Redeemer are beyond all conception more
   glorified; so that there will be infinitely more good in the universe,
   both moral and natural, than could have been, had not Christ suffered
   and entered into his glory. And all the other evil that has been, or
   will take place, is, by the sufferings of Christ, made the occasion of
   much greater good, than it could otherwise have been. Surely no one,
   who well considers all this, will ask, "Where is the advantage of
   redemption, and what is gained by it?"

   Question 5. To suffer the penalty of the law is to be accursed, the
   subjects of God's displeasure and wrath; but God the Father was not
   displeased with his Son Jesus Christ; for he was always his beloved
   Son, and even in his sufferings the Father was pleased with him, and
   loved him because he gave his life for the redeemed. How then could
   Jesus Christ suffer the penalty of the law?

   Ans. St. Paul says, "Christ hath redeemed us. from the curse of the
   law, being made a curse for us: as it is written, cursed is every one
   that hangeth on a tree." [447] In the place to which the apostle
   refers, the words are, "He that is hanged, is accursed of God." And
   there is indeed no real curse but the curse of God. Christ therefore
   was made such, even the curse of the law, in order to deliver believers
   in him from this curse. The curse of the law consists in the infinite
   evil, pain and suffering which sin deserves, as has been shown. He who
   suffers this for sin, suffers the curse of the law, is accursed, or
   made a curse. Jesus Christ suffered this curse, the infinite natural
   evil in which the penalty or the curse of the law consists; and in
   suffering it for sinners, and in their stead, was made a curse. This
   might be consistent with his having the approbation of the Father, and
   his favour and love to the highest degree. The displeasure of God,
   which was the cause of his sufferings, and which was manifested and
   expressed in his sufferings when he voluntarily took, and stood In the
   place of sinners, was displeasure with sin, and the sinner, and not
   with him who suffered; the state of the case being fully understood by
   the spectators. Great displeasure and wrath was indeed discovered and
   expressed in the sufferings of Christ. For all natural evil, wherever
   it takes place, is an expression of the divine displeasure with sin;
   and could not have been inflicted, in any case, had no moral evil
   existed; and the greater the natural evil is, which is inflicted, the
   more or the greater degree of displeasure is expressed. And for the Son
   of God to suffer all this, the whole curse, without any mitigation or
   abatement, when he so far espoused the cause of sinners, as to take
   their place, and suffer for them, when he was not only innocent, but
   infinitely beloved by the Father, and most honourable and worthy in his
   sight, was a much greater manifestation and expression of the divine
   hatred of rebellion, and his unalterable disposition to inflict the
   penalty of his law, and maintain his moral government, than if every
   sinner had been punished, and the penalty of the law were inflicted on
   all transgressors without exception. The Father's not sparing his own
   Son, but giving him up to suffer the whole curse of the law, when he
   espoused the cause of sinners, is a most striking evidence of rectitude
   and righteousness, and regard to his law, and fixed determination to
   support it, and inflict the penalty, even though his own well beloved
   Son must suffer it. And that must be great displeasure and wrath which
   is expressed by the suffering and death of the Son of God, a person so
   infinitely worthy, and so beloved by the Father.

   When the Son of God is beheld thus suffering, expiring on the cross in
   the sight of the whole universe, and crying out, "My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?" it is natural to inquire and consider,
   "Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto his only begotten, dearly
   beloved Son: What meaneth the heat of this great anger?" The answer
   will be easy to all the discerning: They will understand the reason and
   design of the whole, and the instruction will dwell on their minds with
   increasing clearness and energy forever. It will be forever known and
   kept in view in the kingdom of God, that mankind rose in rebellion, and
   fell under the curse of the law of God, and his high displeasure: And
   that a way might be opened for a reconciliation, and favour to man,
   consistent with the divine law which cursed him, and with the
   righteousness and wisdom of Governor of the world, the Son of God took
   the place of man, was made under the law, and took the curse upon
   himself; which therefore was inflicted on him without the least
   mitigation. This is the reason of these dreadful sufferings of this
   infinitely great and worthy personage. "It pleased the Lord thus to
   bruise him, and put him to grief," as the strongest expression of his
   great displeasure, and the heat of his anger with the sinners whose
   cause he espoused, so as to take their place, and answer for them. This
   wrath is not against the Son of his love; but against the rebellion of
   those sinners for whom he suffers. [448]

   The Redeemer being united to those sinners for whom he had undertaken
   to suffer by the most strong, ardent, benevolent affection, and by thus
   taking their place as their head and Saviour, was prepared in and by
   his human nature to be impressed with a clear apprehension and awful
   sense of the dreadful displeasure of God with them, and with sin, and
   to have the most painful sensation, of their infinitely miserable
   situation as deserving and justly exposed to the effects of the heat of
   his anger and wrath. And thus this anger and wrath, in this sense, fell
   on him, and his soul, in this situation, and thus united to them, was
   necessarily filled with the greatest pain and distress. And all things
   were so ordered, when the time of his most dreadful sufferings came on,
   as to raise this view and sensation to the highest degree. The
   comfortable and happifying sense of the love and favour of God was
   withdrawn, and the human soul was filled with the most dreadful gloom,
   distress and horror in a most keen sense of the anger and wrath of God,
   net against himself personally, bur with those whom he loved, and were,
   in a sense, one with him; so that their evil was his evil, and it even
   necessarily came on him. In this sense he suffered the displeasure and
   wrath of God. He felt it as insupportably dreadful, and had an
   overwhelming sense of it. And the displeasure and wrath of God against
   sinners was the cause of all his sufferings.

   This appears to have been the chief source of the sufferings of Christ.
   What he suffered by his body, by the cruelty and rage of men, who could
   only torture him in his body, though great, was as nothing, compared
   with what he suffered in his mind, by the circumstances just mentioned.
   Many martyrs have suffered, as great bodily pain as was inflicted on
   the Redeemer; and they have endured it with great comfort and joy.
   Their minds have appeared to be out of the reach of the bodily tortures
   which were inflicted on them, so that they hardly felt them; but
   rejoiced in God, and the light of his countenance. Why then was the
   soul of the Redeemer troubled, and sorrowful even unto death? Why were
   there no expressions of comfort and joy even on the cross? Why did he
   cry out "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" The view of the
   case as stated above, will fully account for it, and appears to be the
   only satisfactory account of the matter.

   Thus we see how Christ suffered for sin, was made a curse, that is,
   suffered the curse of the law, the curse of God: and in his sufferings,
   he, in a sense, suffered and felt the displeasure and wrath of God; and
   the anger of God against sin and the sinner was in a high and eminent
   degree manifested and expressed in the sufferings and death of Christ,
   consistent with his not being displeased, but well pleased with Christ
   himself, and loving him because he laid down his life for his people.

   The instance mentioned above, of the husband suffering for the crime of
   his wife, and in her stead, serves in some measure to illustrate this
   point. The displeasure of government, or of the king, with the
   criminal, and the great offence she had given, and his fixed
   determination to manifest and express this by inflicting the penalty
   threatened to such offences, were as fully exhibited, and made known by
   the suffering of the husband in her stead, as if she had suffered, and,
   in some respects, much more, as the king would not, in this case, spare
   him, though he was a person so greatly esteemed and beloved. And he
   might with truth be said to suffer the displeasure and wrath of the
   king, as this was the cause of his sufferings, and was expressed in
   them; of which he was not personally the object, but the criminal.

   Question 6. How is the threatening of the law in truth and reality
   executed by the sufferings of another, and not of him who is
   threatened? The transgressor only is threatened; and if it be not
   executed on him, it is not really executed at all. How can the
   sufferings of another, who is not the transgressor, and is not
   threatened, answer any end with respect to the threatening?

   Ans. 1. It has been shown, and it is abundantly evident from scripture,
   that the sufferings of Christ had respect to the threatening of the
   law. Were there no such threatening, or were it not to be regarded,
   there could be no occasion for any suffering, and there would be no
   reason why Christ should suffer in order to the redemption of man. It
   has also been made evident that Christ did suffer the curse of the law,
   or the threatened penalty.

   He suffered the evil threatened, or as great evil, a complete
   equivalent, if not precisely the same evil in every circumstance, which
   the sinner must have suffered, had the threatening been executed on
   him. It has, moreover, been shewn that all the ends of die threatening,
   and of a penalty, are as fully answered by the sufferings of Christ, as
   they could be by the execution of it on the sinner: As much respect is
   paid to the divine law; government is as well supported; the rectitude
   and righteousness of God, is as much declared; and his displeasure with
   the sinner and hatred of rebellion, and determination to punish it, as
   much manifested; and in some respects much more, and to greater
   advantage. If there be any difficulty still remaining in the case, it
   is, whether a substitute may suffer the penalty in the room of the
   sinner, and the latter, by this means, escape punishment, consistent
   with the threatening, and so that it shall be truly and properly
   executed, and the truth of the legislator in the threatening be
   maintained. Or whether the threatening can be really executed by
   vicarious sufferings.

   This leads to

   Ans. II. It is evident from scripture, that the law of God does admit
   of a substitute, both in obeying the precepts, and suffering the
   penalty of it; and that this is consistent with the true spirit and
   meaning of it.

   When man was first created, and placed under the law of God, and moral
   government, Adam, the Father of the human race, was constituted their
   public head and representative, to obey the law for them, so that they
   should have the benefit of his obedience, and obtain eternal life by
   it, if he persevered in obedience through the appointed time of trial.
   Thus Adam was made a substitute, to obey the divine law for all
   mankind, in their room and stead. And it was hereby publicly declared
   by God, the Legislator, that his law admitted of a substitute. And if
   the law admitted of a substitute to obey for all the rest, of whom he
   was made the natural and constituted head; and by his single act of
   disobedience to bring sin and ruin on ail his posterity; and God had
   declared that this was the best and most wise way of administering his
   moral government in this world: then a substitute might suffer the
   penalty of the law for man, and redeem him from that sin and ruin which
   was brought upon him by the disobedience of a substitute, if a proper
   person, sufficient to suffer this, and survive the suffering, can be
   found. Had Adam, after he transgressed and incurred the penalty of the
   law, been able to suffer it, and survive and perfect the obedience
   which was required, this would have answered the law, according- to the
   declared meaning of it: He would have retrieved himself, and saved his
   posterity from sin and ruin. Adam was infinitely unequal to this: But a
   "second Adam" was found; a second public head and representative, of
   whom the first Adam was a type, figure or model, who was able to suffer
   the penalty of the law for man, and in his stead, and survive the
   dreadful scene; and by it redeem man, even all who are united to him by
   believing in him, from the curse of the law. [449]

   Therefore, this being the declared meaning of the law, that it admitted
   a substitute, both to obey the precepts of it, and to suffer the
   penalty, and that the threatening of it was to be so understood; a
   second public head and substitute, who was revealed and promised when
   the first Adam had ruined himself and his posterity, has risen and
   suffered the penalty, in the room of sinners. Thus the threatening has
   been fully executed according to the true and declared meaning of it,
   when it was given; and as it has been fully explained in the divine
   conduct, in constituting a second man, the last Adam, and inflicting
   the threatened penalty on him. And in this way, "mercy and truth are
   met together: Righteousness and peace have kissed each other." [450]
   God has, agreeable to the strictest truth, executed the threatening of
   his law, according to the true intent and meaning of it; and by this
   has opened a way for reconciliation and peace with man, while his truth
   and righteousness are maintained, and gloriously manifested.

   Quest. 7. Do not the sufferings of Christ remove the ill desert of
   those who believe in him? Christ has suffered all the evil that sin
   deserves, all that to which the sinner is liable, from the threatening
   and his ill desert, as great, and as much as could justly be inflicted
   on the sinner. If the sinner could have suffered all this evil himself,
   and survive such sufferings, he would then have no ill desert, it would
   not be just to inflict any more evil upon him. And if Christ has
   suffered it all for him, and in his stead, how can he deserve any
   punishment? And what grace is there then in pardoning the sinner who
   believes in Christ; or rather, What need has he of pardon?

   Ans. The sufferings of Christ do not alter the character of the sinner,
   in the least. His ill desert is according to his whole moral character,
   according to what he is, and has done, as a moral agent; he may justly
   be treated according to this. And to treat him thus, would be doing him
   no injury. Therefore not to treat him according to his moral character,
   but to treat him better and more favourably, is mere grace and
   undeserved favour. The sufferings of Christ, therefore, do not make the
   least alteration, or any abatement of his ill desert, as the sinner's
   own character is not hereby made better.

   If the sinner were to suffer the penalty himself, in his own person;
   and were able to do this, and survive his suffering; this would alter
   his moral character, as he would then have completely compensated for
   his crime, it being extinguished by his suffering all the evil which it
   deserves; no more could be required, or justly inflicted upon him. His
   whole character being considered, his crimes and sufferings, he would
   stand right in law, and have no need of a pardon, and there would be no
   grace in not punishing him yet more. The vicarious sufferings of a
   substitute are quite different, and opposite, in this respect, to the
   sufferings of the sinner, which have been supposed, though really
   impossible. For in the case of vicarious sufferings, the sinner's
   character remains the same, and he continues as ill deserving as ever,
   and must feel so, if his discerning and feeling be according to truth.
   Had Adam persevered in obedience, to the end of the time of his trial,
   by his vicarious obedience, all his children would have been admitted
   to the enjoyment of the favour of God, and eternal life; but this
   vicarious obedience of their substitute would not have rendered them in
   the least degree more deserving of such favour, than if there had been
   no such obedience. For Adam's obedience was not their own personal
   obedience, and never could be; and therefore could not be considered as
   such. So the sufferings of Christ, not being the sufferings of the
   sinner, but of a substitute, cannot render the sinner less ill
   deserving in himself, or personally considered, more than the vicarious
   obedience of a substitute can render those for whom he obeys more
   worthy of reward.

   The husband's suffering for his wife, the punishment which she
   deserved, may serve to illustrate this point. His suffering did not
   render her in the least less deserving of punishment, as it did not
   alter her character; and it was as much an act of mere grace to pardon
   her, as if her husband had not suffered. The end that his suffering
   answered, was to open the way for her pardon, consistent with public
   justice, and the general good; and not to reader her the less ill
   deserving.

   Ques. 8. Would it not have been a higher exercise of mercy and grace to
   save sinners without an atonement; without buying and redeeming them at
   so great a price? Many have thought that the doctrine of an atonement
   stated above, as necessary m order to the exercise of divine grace, in
   pardoning and saving sinners, gives a dishonourable notion of the
   goodness of God, and represents his mercy unspeakably less, than it
   would appear to be, if sinners were forgiven and saved, without any
   price paid for their redemption, or atonement made for their sins.

   Ans. If the nature and design of an atonement be well understood, and
   kept in mind, as it has been stated and represented in the beginning of
   this chapter, it will appear that the benevolence and grace of God, in
   saving sinners without an atonement, were this consistent with
   rectitude and wisdom, would have been unspeakably less, than that which
   is now exercised in the redemption of sinners by the atonement of
   Christ; this being necessary to render their salvation possible,
   consistent with righteousness, truth, and goodness itself. Indeed, as
   the case was, there would have been no grace in pardoning sinners, and
   saving them without an atonement, for this would have been contrary to
   infinite goodness. A full answer to this question is found in the first
   chapter of this part.

   Having considered the atonement which it was necessary for the Redeemer
   to make by his own sufferings, in order to redeem man; and which he has
   actually made by suffering the penalty of the law, which was the
   greatest, and most difficult part of his work, as the Redeemer of men,
   it must in the next place be observed,

   II. The work of the Redeemer consists, in part, in his perfect
   obedience to the law of God. This is an essential part of the character
   and work of the Redeemer of man; for he could not directly honour the
   precepts of the law in any way, or by any thing, but by obeying them;
   and the least instance of disobedience or disregard to any one of them
   would have ruined his character as the Redeemer of man.

   The Son of God, united to the human nature, and considered as God and
   man in one person, was not under any original obligation to that
   obedience which he voluntarily took upon himself to perform. This
   divine person was above any obligation to obedience, as a subject and
   servant. He was, in the human nature, perfectly holy, as God is holy;
   but this he might be, and continue so forever, and yet not be under
   obligation to yield the obedience to which he submitted. The Son of God
   did not take upon him the form of a servant, merely by becoming man, by
   being made flesh, and taking the human nature into a personal union;
   but as he became flesh, and was made in the likeness of men, that
   hereby he might be capable of obeying and suffering in the human
   nature, he voluntarily took upon himself the form of a servant, and
   being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
   obedient unto death. [451] "When the fulness of time was come, God sent
   forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law." [452] The Son of
   God being made of a woman, that is, being made flesh, and becoming man,
   uniting himself to the human nature, did not necessarily put him under
   the law, or lay him under obligation to obey it, as a subject, or
   servant, or to suffer the penalty of it. Therefore, the apostle, in
   these words, distinguishes between these; he was not only made of a
   woman, took the human nature into a personal union with himself; but
   was also made under the law. When he was originally above law, or any
   obligation to obedience, he voluntarily took the place of sinners, and
   was made under the law, and became obliged to suffer the penalty, and
   obey the precepts of it, "to redeem them that were under the law, and
   under the curse of it, and that they might receive the adoption of
   sons." It was necessary that he should suffer the curse of the law, to
   redeem men from the curse of it; and it was equally necessary that he
   should obey the precepts of the law, in man's stead, that believers in
   him might receive the adoption of sons, and obtain complete deliverance
   from sin, and become heirs of eternal life.

   The atonement made by Christ, in his suffering the penalty of the law,
   has respect only to the threatening of the law, that by suffering what
   was threatened, and what sin deserves, sinners who believe in him might
   be delivered from the curse. Thus Christ died for sin; was sacrificed
   or offered to bear the sins of many; and he shed his blood for the
   remission of sins, as the scripture asserts. This atonement therefore
   only delivers from the curse of the law, and procures the remission of
   their sins who believe in him; but does not procure for them any
   positive good: It leaves them under the power of sin, and without any
   title to eternal life, or any positive favour, or actual fitness or
   capacity to enjoy positive happiness. This would be but a very partial
   redemption, had the Redeemer done no more than merely to make atonement
   for sin, by suffering the penalty of the law for sinners, and in their
   stead. It was therefore necessary that he should obey the precepts of
   the law for man, and in his stead, that by his perfect and meritorious
   obedience, he might honour the law in the preceptive part of it, and
   obtain all the positive favour and benefits which man needed, be they
   ever so many and great.

   It has been observed, that when man was first created, it was made
   known by the Legislator, that his law admitted of vicarious obedience;
   that the obedience of one might be the proper ground of granting the
   greatest favours to all whom he represented, and for whom, and in whose
   stead he acted. This he did by constituting Adam a public and federal
   head of his posterity, and substituting him to act for them all, so
   that by his obedience through the time of his trial, his children
   should obtain eternal life. If this were proper and wise, and
   consistent with the exercise of the most perfect moral government, and
   with the true design and spirit of the moral law, as it most certainly
   was; then there is equal propriety and wisdom in substituting the
   second public head, the Redeemer of men, to act, to obey, for all the
   redeemed, who shall believe in him, so that they shall have as. much
   favour, at least, as if they had performed perfect obedience in their
   own persons. The obedience of the second Adam, the Son of God, must be
   infinitely more worthy of regard, and meritorious, than the obedience
   of the first Adam, for two reasons.

   1. He was infinitely greater and more excellent, and worthy, than Adam
   was. Therefore his obedience was proportionally more excellent,
   meritorious and pleasing to God. And it was proportionally more
   honourable to the law, which he obeyed, and to the Legislator and
   divine government. It may be truly said, that the obedience of Christ
   to the divine law had more excellence and worth in it, than the
   highest, most perfect and all possible obedience of all the mere
   creatures in the universe; and the law of God is unspeakably more
   dignified and honoured in the precepts of it, by the former, than it
   can be by the latter.

   2dly. The obedience of Adam, the first public head, was but a just debt
   which he owed to God, for himself, in his own person. The law required
   perfect obedience of him; he was under indispensable obligation to this
   every moment of his existence: Therefore it was impossible for him to
   merit any thing by doing more than his duty, while he gave himself
   wholly to God, in the strongest love of which he was capable, and in
   the highest and most difficult acts of obedience; he gave no more than
   he owed, as an original and just debt, arising from his existence and
   capacity, as a creature of God. But the Son of God, as has been
   observed, was under no obligation to obey as he did, as a subject and
   servant: he owed nothing of this nature for himself, he being above all
   law, in this respect, until he voluntarily took upon him the form of a
   servant, and put himself under the law, not only to suffer the penalty
   of it, not for himself, but for others; but to obey it, not for
   himself, as if he owed such obedience, but for others, that they might
   have the benefit of it. In this respect, the obedience of the Redeemer
   was in the highest sense and degree worthy of reward, and meritorious
   for himself and those for whom he obeyed. All the glory, which is the
   consequence of his obedience and sufferings, and all the positive good
   to himself, and his church, is the reward of the Redeemer, and of the
   redeemed with him. Because he took upon him the form of a servant, and
   was obedient unto death: Therefore God hath highly exalted him, and
   given him a name, which is above every name." [453] The Lord is well
   pleased for his righteousness sake, and hath delivered all things into
   his hands, and made him head over all things to the church, to complete
   the redemption of it, and give eternal life to as many as were given to
   him.

   In this view it may be said that the reward of the obedience of the Son
   of God is infinitely greater than that which the first Adam would have
   obtained, had he obeyed. The Redeemer has by his obedience obtained
   unspeakably greater good, happiness and glory, for his church, the
   redeemed, than the obedience of Adam would have procured for his
   posterity. Speaking of the redeemed, he says, "I am come that they
   might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." [454]
   They are raised up to sit with him, even on his throne, to reign with
   him, as kings and priests, sharing with him in his felicity and glory.
   All this is the fruit and reward of the obedience of the Mediator. The
   redeemed enjoy the benefit of his obedience as much as if they
   themselves had performed it, or it were their own obedience, though
   they, in themselves, in their own persons, are as unworthy as if Christ
   had not obeyed the law for them.

   The obedience of Christ, though most excellent and meritorious, is not
   an atonement for the sins of men, or really any part of it. It is
   impossible that any mere obedience, however excellent and meritorious,
   should make atonement for the least sin. This can be done by nothing
   but suffering the penalty of the law, the evil with which transgression
   is threatened, as has been shown, while attending to the sufferings of
   Christ.

   Christ did, indeed, obey in suffering; and this was, perhaps, the
   highest act or instance of his obedience. As a servant he received a
   commandment from the Father to lay down his life to make atonement for
   the sins of men. This was the most difficult part, and the greatest
   trial of his obedience. He set his face as a flint, and went through
   the whole with a persevering steadiness and resolution; and in this was
   the strongest exercise and expression of his love to God and man, and
   regard for the law of God, and the divine government. And this was
   therefore the most pleasing to God, and the most meritorious part of
   his obedience, when he "became obedient unto death, even the death of
   the cross;" as it was also the greatest instance of his suffering, in
   which the atonement which he made by suffering, chiefly consisted. And
   it was necessary that his suffering should be voluntary, and so an act
   of obedience, as far as he was active, in order to his suffering
   justly, and making any atonement thereby. But though the Redeemer
   obeyed in sufferings, and suffered in obeying; and his highest and most
   meritorious obedience was acted out in his voluntary suffering unto
   death, and in this greatest instance of his suffering, the atonement
   which he made for sin chiefly consisted; yet his obedience and
   suffering are two perfectly distinct things, and answered different
   ends; and must be considered so, and the distinction and difference
   carefully, and with clearness kept up in the mind, in order to have a
   proper understanding of this very important subject. The sufferings of
   Christ, as such, made atonement for sin, as he suffered the penalty of
   the law, or the curse of it, the evil threatened to transgression, and
   which is the desert of it, in the sinner's stead; by which he opened
   the way for sinners being delivered from the curse, and laid the
   foundation for reconciliation between God, and the transgressors, by
   his not imputing, but pardoning their sins, who believe in the
   Redeemer, and approve of his character and conduct. By the obedience of
   Christ all the positive good, all those favours and blessings are
   merited and obtained, which sinners need, in order to enjoy complete
   and eternal redemption, or everlasting life in the kingdom of God. By
   this he has purchased and obtained the Holy Spirit, by whom sinners are
   so far recovered from total depravity, and renewed, as to be prepared
   and disposed to believe on Christ and receive him, being offered to
   them: And he carries on a work of sanctification in their hearts, until
   they are perfectly holy. Therefore Christ says, he will send and give
   the Holy Spirit, and he Father will send him in his name: and he is
   called the Spirit of Christ, "If I go not away, the Comforter will not
   come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he
   is -come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and
   of judgment. The Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send
   in my name, he shall teach you all things. When the Comforter is come,
   whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth,
   which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me." [455] "If
   any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." [456] This
   gift of the Holy Ghost really comprises all positive good which Christ
   has by his obedience purchased for the redeemed. And as "Christ is the
   end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth," [457]
   all such being interested in his righteousness, and having the benefit
   of it as much as if they had in their own persons perfectly obeyed the
   law, have eternal life made sure to them; the Holy Spirit is given to
   them to abide with them forever, as the earnest of their eternal
   inheritance; and they have a divine promise that they shall never
   perish, but shall persevere in holiness, until they are made perfect,
   "being kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation." All
   which favours they receive by the obedience and merit or righteousness
   of Christ, which is imputed to them, or avails to procure all these
   benefits for them, in consequence of their union to him by faith. But
   these matters will be more fully considered in some of the following
   chapters.

   Before this head is dismissed, it may be useful to observe the
   following things. Though there be a real distinction between the
   atonement which is made by Christ for sin by suffering; and his
   obedience, by which sinners who believe in him are recommended to all
   the positive blessings, which they want, and are bestowed on them; yet
   both these are generally included and meant by the righteousness of
   Christ; but a principal respect seems to be had to the latter, and
   sometimes perhaps that only is intended. He who reads the Bible with
   care will take notice of this. The righteousness of Christ does most
   properly consist in his obedience, by which believers in him obtain
   eternal life, and all positive blessings; yet as his obedience implies
   his sufferings, and his sufferings imply his obedience, and one is as
   necessary for the salvation of men as the other, they are both included
   in his righteousness; as they are both necessarily included in his
   obedience unto death. [458]

   It maybe farther observed, that to be justified by Christ, sometimes
   means only a being pardoned, or deliverance from the curse of the law
   by the sufferings and atonement of Christ, or has a principal respect
   to that; though it includes positive favour, and a title to eternal
   life, which are given to believers, for the sake of the obedience and
   worthiness of Christ. Pardon of sin, or deliverance from the evil which
   sin deserves, is distinguishable from what is called "justification of
   life," [459] which implies a tide to eternal life, though these are
   never separated; for he who is pardoned, is by one and the same act of
   God, also made heir of eternal life, including all the favours which
   the believer receives for the sake of the worthiness and obedience of
   Christ; and is treated as well as if he were perfectly righteous, out
   of respect to the obedience and righteousness of the Redeemer. The
   following seem to be instances in which to justify, or be justified,
   intends only forgiveness of sins on account of the sufferings or
   atonement of Christ; or, at least, to have a primary and chief respect
   to that--"Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man
   is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that
   believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be
   justified by the law of Moses." [460] "Much more then being now
   justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
   [461] Here justification seems to mean no more than pardon of sin, or
   rather opening the way to pardon by the suffering and death of Christ
   in their stead, Christ having died for them.

   Redemption seems also to be sometimes used in a more restrained sense,
   and primarily, if not wholly respects deliverance from the curse of the
   law by the sufferings of Christ, or forgiveness of sins through the
   atonement he has made by suffering the curse of the law. The following
   appear to be instances of this: "In whom we have redemption through his
   blood, the forgiveness of sins." [462] "Christ hath redeemed us from
   the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." [463] Yet this
   includes, and is connected with deliverance from sin and all evil, and
   the bestowment of eternal life, and comprehends the whole work of the
   Redeemer.

   III. Another part of the work of the Redeemer, is to complete the
   salvation of those whom he redeems, and to finish and perfect the work
   of redemption. This has been in some measure brought into view under
   the former head, but requires a more particular consideration. In
   consequence of the suffering and obedience of Christ, and as a reward
   of the latter, he is exalted, to give repentance and remission of sins,
   and complete salvation to those who shall be actually redeemed. All
   things are given into his hands, and all power in heaven and earth: And
   he is made head over all things to the church; that he might sanctify
   and cleanse it, and present it to himself a glorious church, not having
   spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and
   without blemish. As all men are naturally in a state of total
   depravity, enemies to God, his law and government; and therefore
   enemies to the Redeemer, and all his designs and works; not one of them
   can be persuaded to come to him, and accept of the offered salvation,
   unless he be made willing by his mighty power, renewing his heart,
   taking away the heart of stone, the rebellious heart, and giving a
   discerning, obedient heart. This is represented in the scripture by a
   variety of phrases, and abundantly asserted, which may be more fully
   considered in a following chapter. The Redeemer having renewed by the
   spirit, those whom he designs to save, so far as to bring them to a
   union with himself by faith, and to become his real friends, carries on
   this work through life, until they are brought at death to perfection
   in holiness; and he will raise their bodies at the last day, and give
   them eternal life. All this he has declared he will do. He has said,
   "All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me, and him that cometh
   to me, I will in no wise cast out. This is the will of the Father,
   which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose
   nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the
   will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son and
   believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at
   the last day." [464]

   He is exalted to the right hand of God, and sits on the throne of the
   universe, having all things in his hands, and governing the whole
   world, so as in the best manner to save the redeemed, and fulfil the
   good pleasure of his goodness towards them, and totally to disappoint,
   overthrow and destroy all his and their enemies, putting them under his
   feet, when he will come to judge the world in righteousness.

   The Redeemer, in prosecuting his work, sustains the character, and
   performs the offices of prophet, priest and king. He is, in the moral
   world, especially in his church and kingdom, what the sun is in the
   natural world, the light thereof. He is therefore called "the Sun of
   righteousness." He said, "I am the light of the world: He that
   followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
   life. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me,
   should not abide in darkness." [465]

   The Redeemer is the author of all the moral light and instruction
   afforded to men. He has given the divine revelation which we enjoy. He
   inspired men by his Spirit to write that part of scripture which the
   church enjoyed before his incarnation. [466] He taught and instructed
   men when in the flesh on earth; and inspired the apostles and others to
   write what is contained in the New Testament, in which, among other
   things, all the future, grand events, that relate to his church and
   kingdom, and to the world of mankind in general, which are to take
   place to the end of the world, are foretold; and by all which life and
   immortality are brought to light. And he opens the eyes of blind
   sinners, and turns them from darkness to marvellous light, causing the
   light of truth contained in divine revelation to shine in their hearts.
   And he forms the hearts of his disciples more and more to true
   discerning, till they are cured of all their mistakes and darkness, and
   brought into perfect light and day. In order to this he has instituted
   and maintains all the external means of instruction and knowledge; with
   reference to which St. Paul says, "When he ascended up on high, he led
   captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. And he gave some Apostles,
   and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers,
   for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
   edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the
   faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
   the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." [467]

   And he not only exerciseth the office of a prophet till he has brought
   his church to a state of perfect light and knowledge, but he will
   sustain this character in heaven forever: For the Lamb shall be the
   everlasting light of it. [468] He will make new discoveries, and give
   increasing light and knowledge without any end. The Redeemer therefore
   is promised in the character of a prophet, when his incarnation is
   foretold. "For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a prophet shall the
   Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me." [469]

   Christ is also a priest in his church. The great high priest, of whom
   all the priests, constituted by the laws of God given to Moses, were
   types. He has offered the only sacrifice, by which full atonement is
   made for sin. And in this transaction, he is both the priest, the
   sacrifice, and the altar. And though by his once offering himself a
   sacrifice for the sins of his people, he has made complete atonement
   for sin; yet he continues to exercise the office of the priest, and u
   ill do so forever. "He is made an high priest forever, after the order
   of Melchisedec. Because he ever liveth, he hath an unchangeable
   priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost,
   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
   for them." [470] Therefore he appears on the throne in heaven, as a
   Lamb that had been slain, and is represented as entering and remaining
   there with his own blood. The atonement of Christ, which he has made by
   his blood, for the sins of the redeemed, and his meritorious obedience,
   and the consequent intercession which he will forever make for them,
   will be their everlasting security from wrath and destruction, and for
   their enjoyment of the divine favour, and eternal life, as their ill
   desert, in their own persons, and in themselves considered, will remain
   without the least diminution forever. Therefore the Redeemer continues
   a high priest forever, and because he ever lives to make intercession
   for his people, they shall live also, eternally dependent on his
   atonement, merit, and worthiness, for safety from evil, and for all the
   good which they enjoy. "Behold the man whose name is the branch, and he
   shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the
   Lord: (that is, the church.) Even he shall build the temple of the
   Lord, and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his
   throne, and he shall be a Priest upon his throne." [471] He will
   continue in the office of a priest, as long as he shall sit upon his
   throne, and his kingdom lasts, which shall be forever. This leads
   farther to observe,

   Jesus Christ, in the work of redemption, acts in the character of ruler
   and king. He is a prophet, and a priest upon his throne. He exerciseth
   the authority of a king. This is abundantly asserted in scripture. "I
   have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." [472] "My heart is
   inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made
   touching the king." [473] He is the king, by way of eminence. He ib
   King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme authority as
   legislator in his church. He has made institutions and laws which are
   binding on his people, they being obliged implicitly to obey his
   commands in all things. And he is the only lawgiver. And as all men are
   naturally in a state of rebellion, and enemies to God, he not only
   commands them to repent and submit to him; but he effectually conquers
   and subdues all those who become his willing subjects, by a powerful
   operation on their hearts, changing a; id renewing them, and bringing
   them to a cordial obedience to him. Thus his people are all made
   willing in the day of his power. He protects his church and people from
   all their enemies, and from all harm; and gradually removes all the
   disaffection to him in their hearts, until they are all brought to a
   most cheerful, perfect obedience to him, and his throne is established
   in their hearts, and he rules there without a competitor. And he rules
   in the midst of his enemies. They are all under his powder and control,
   and he restrains, guides and governs them, so that they cannot cross
   and impede his designs, or do the least hurt to his interest and
   kingdom, however much they may desire and attempt it; but he uses them
   all to promote and answer his own ends. The wrath of man shall praise
   him: and the remainder of wrath he will restrain. [474] And he will
   finally subdue all his enemies, and put them under his feet.

   The Redeemer now reigns over all. All things are delivered into his
   hands; both angels, men, and devils are in his hand, and under his
   direction and control: Yea, all creatures and things, visible and
   invisible, in the whole created universe, both greater and less, are
   sustained and guided by him, in all their various circumstances and
   motions; and he is ordering and using them to answer his own ends, as
   King of Zion, and head over all things to the church. In the mean time
   he is forming his church, and will not cease working till he has made
   it the most perfect, beautiful, happy and glorious society and kingdom,
   that infinite power, wisdom and goodness can produce; which shall stand
   and flourish forever, as a monument to display all these: and in which
   his boundless, wonderful love and grace, in the redemption of man, and
   his unchangeable truth and faithfulness, shall be celebrated without
   end, and with increasing admiration and praise.

   In the exercise of his kingly office, when all the redeemed are brought
   into his kingdom, and the number of his church is completed, he will
   appear and sit as judge of all moral agents; will raise the dead; and
   cause all the angels and devils, and all mankind to stand before his
   tribunal; and when the moral character of every one shall be properly
   examined and displayed, he will, as king and the final judge of all,
   pronounce the blessed sentence on the redeemed, admitting them as the
   happy members of his eternal kingdom: And he will sentence all those of
   mankind u ho shall then appear not to have been his friends in this
   world, to endless punishment, with the devil and his angels. [475] And
   having thus completed the work of redemption, by gathering the redeemed
   into his kingdom; and putting all his enemies under his feet,
   consigning them to deserved, endless punishment, he will reign forever
   in his church, his mediatorial kingdom, which shall have no end. That
   his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and the Redeemer shall reign in
   it forever, is abundantly declared in the Scripture. It is needless to
   cite now more than the words of the angel to the virgin Mary. "He shall
   be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: And the Lord God
   shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign
   over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no
   end." [476]

   What St. Paul says may be thought, at the first view, to be
   inconsistent with this. His words are, "Then cometh the end, when he
   shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he
   shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. And when all
   things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be
   subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in
   all." [477] In order to understand this passage, and see that it is
   consistent with other parts of scripture, where the Redeemer is said to
   reign in his kingdom forever, the following things must be observed.

   1. In consequence of the Son of God, or second Person in the Trinity,
   undertaking the work of redemption, by becoming the Son of Man, and
   taking upon himself the form of a servant, and doing and suffering ail
   that was necessary in order to effect this, and having actually gone
   through all this; he was exalted, in and by his human nature, and
   rewarded by having all power, and all things put into his hands, and
   being made head over all things to the church; and is appointed the
   supreme and universal king and governor of the universe, to use and
   dispose of all, so as in the best manner to accomplish and perfect the
   work of redemption, and complete the salvation of the redeemed, and
   vanquish and totally overthrow all his and their enemies, by putting
   them under his footstool. This must be considered as a peculiar kind
   and degree of power and authority with which he is invested, by which
   he sits on the throne of the universe, and is sole ruler, in the
   natural and moral world, until the ends of this investiture shall be
   answered; and he has finished the work, to accomplish which, he is thus
   exalted. He will then, when an end to this is come, deliver up to the
   Father this delegated power and kingdom; and no longer, as God and man,
   sit at the right hand of the Father, as supreme ruler in the universal
   kingdom. This leads to observe,

   2. When all this is accomplished, the Son of God, being God and man,
   and considered in the character and capacity of Mediator and Redeemer
   of his church, will take his proper place which is assigned to him in
   the economy of redemption, or covenant between the Father and Son;
   which is not that of supreme ruler and legislator in the universal
   kingdom of God; but in this respect, and in his human nature he will be
   subject to the Father. And then God, the Deity, will be all in all, in
   a higher sense, and more perspicuously, than when the supreme rule was
   in the hand of a person who is a man, and the Son of man. And who made
   use of the agency and offices of angels and men in carrying on his
   designs, which will then all be put down: And who is opposed, and his
   power and authority disputed by his enemies, devils and men, which will
   then all be subdued, and put out of the way.

   3. The Redeemer will still remain the head of his church, and reign
   forever as king in his mediatorial kingdom; crowned with everlasting
   honour, happiness and glory, of which he will lose nothing by
   delivering up the kingdom to the Father, and being subject to him, in
   the sense abovementioned. He will be admired, praised and glorified by
   angels and the redeemed forever; and he will be their everlasting,
   unchangeable prophet, priest and king.

   As the covenant between the Father and the Son has been now mentioned,
   it will be proper here to give a brief explanation of that. It is
   evident from scripture, as well as from the nature of the case, that
   there was a mutual agreement and engagement between the Father and the
   second person of the Trinity respecting the redemption of man, by which
   the distinct part which each person in the Trinity was to act, was
   fixed, and undertaken. This mutual agreement is of the nature of a
   covenant and engagement with each other, to perform the different parts
   of this great work which were assigned to them. This is an eternal
   covenant, without beginning, as is the existence of the triune God, and
   as are all the divine purposes and decrees. The second person was
   engaged to become incarnate, to do and suffer all that was necessary
   for the salvation of men. The Father promised that on his consenting to
   take upon him the character and work of a Mediator and Redeemer, he
   should be every way furnished and assisted to go through with the work;
   that he should have power to save an elect number of mankind, and form
   a church and kingdom, most perfect and glorious': In order to
   accomplish this, all things, all power in heaven and earth, should be
   given to him, until Redemption was completed: And then he should reign
   in the exercise of all his offices, as Mediator, in his church and
   kingdom forever.

   All this is expressed or implied in the representation the Bible gives
   of this affair, in the following passages, as well as others which
   might be mentioned. "I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I
   will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son,
   this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the
   heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
   thy possession, &c." [478] Here the Father makes promises, and enters
   into engagements with the Son, which is here called the decree, or
   covenant. To the same purpose are the following words: "The Lord said
   unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
   footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion;
   rule thou in the midst of thine enemies." [479] "Behold my servant whom
   I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit
   upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. I the Lord
   have called thee in righteousness, and I will hold thine hand, and will
   keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of
   the Gentiles." [480] The consent and engagement of the second person is
   expressed in the following words: "Sacrifice and offering thou didst
   not desire, mine ears hast thou opened, (or a body hast thou prepared
   me.) Burnt offering, and sin offering, hast thou not required. Then
   said I, lo, I come. In the volume of the book it is written of me, I
   delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart."
   [481] Upon this engagement of the Son, "the Father saith unto the Son,
   thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. A sceptre of righteousness is
   the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
   iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
   of gladness above thy fellows." [482] The whole of this is comprehended
   and implied in the following words of our Saviour when on earth. "All
   that the Father hath given me, shall come unto me; and him that cometh
   to me, I will in no wise cast out; for I came down from heaven, not to
   do mine own will, bat the will of him that sent me. And this is the
   Father's will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I
   should lose nothing; but should raise it up again at the last day."
   [483] To this covenant Jesus Christ refers when he said to his
   disciples, after his resurrection, "Behold I send the promise of my
   Father upon you:" but tarry ye in Jerusalem, until ye be endued with
   power from on high. And being assembled together with them, he
   commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for
   the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. [484]
   By the promise of the Father, he meant the gift of the Holy Ghost, to
   furnish them for their work as his apostles. And this promise must be
   the promise made to him in the covenant of redemption, that upon his
   obedience unto death, the Holy Spirit should be sent, effectually to
   apply the redemption hereby obtained, to those who were; given to him.

   The blessed Trinity in the one God may be considered as a most exalted,
   happy and glorious society, or family, uniting in the plan of divine
   operations; especially in accomplishing the work of redemption, which
   really comprehends all things, and is the grand design and end of all.
   In this each one has his part to perform according to a most wise,
   mutual regulation and agreement, which may be called a covenant. In
   performing these several parts of this work, one acts as superior, and
   another as inferior; or one acts under another; and by his authority,
   as appointed and sent by him. This is by divines called the economy of
   the work of redemption; or the economical agreement or covenant between
   the persons of the adorable Trinity respecting the redemption of man.
   [485] According to this economy, the Son, the Redeemer, acts under the
   Father, and by his will and appointment; and in this respect takes an
   inferior part; and in this sense he is supposed to speak, when he says,
   "The Father is greater than I." [486]

   Though in the passages of scripture which have been mentioned, and
   others of the same kind, the third person in the Trinity, the Holy
   Spirit, is not expressly mentioned as covenanting, or engaging to
   perform any part of this work; yet he is necessarily understood as
   concerned and included in this covenant, as he is m the holy scripture
   every where represented as acting an equal part in the redemption of
   man; and therefore must be considered as taking that particular part by
   consent and agreement. This covenant is called by most divines now, the
   covenant of redemption, to distinguish it from what is called the
   covenant of grace, which takes place between God, or the Redeemer, and
   believers in him, which will be particularly considered hereafter.

   The work of the Redeemer, which has been in some measure described
   above, consists in his actually performing the part assigned to him,
   and undertaken by him, in the covenant of redemption; and in his
   sustaining the character and executing the offices which he inherits as
   a reward for his humiliation; in which he will continue forever, even
   when he has delivered up the delegated rule and kingdom which he now
   has, to the Father, and is, in the sense above explained, subject to
   the Father.

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. WE learn from the view which has been now given from the scriptures,
   of the work of the Mediator and Redeemer, how important and essential
   the doctrine of his divinity is: As he must be God as well as man, in
   order to perform this work. A mere creature would be infinitely unequal
   to this.

   It is necessary that this should be believed; that his infinitely high
   and glorious person and character, as the true God, should be kept in
   view, in order to trust in him as the Redeemer of man from the infinite
   evil which he deserves; from a state of total moral depravity, to the
   favour of God, to perfect holiness and eternal life, by his suffering
   and obedience, and by his power, wisdom and goodness.

   It is necessary that he should be a person of infinite dignity,
   excellence and worthiness, in order to make atonement for sin by
   suffering the penalty of the law, as it has been explained above from
   the scriptures. The sufferings of a mere creature could do nothing
   towards this; and had such an one offered to undertake this, it would
   have been so far from pleasing the governor of the world, that it must
   be considered as an affront offered to him, most dishonourable to his
   character, law, and government. And the obedience of a mere creature,
   or of all creatures, could not so honour the law, and the divine
   authority expressed by it, which sinners had reproached and trampled
   under foot by their rebellion, as to obtain favour, recovery from a
   state of sin, and eternal life for them, out of respect to the merit
   and worthiness of such obedience. This could be done by none but a
   person of infinite greatness and worth; and one who was under no
   obligation to obey antecedent to his voluntarily taking upon him the
   form of a servant. And it requires infinite power, skill and wisdom to
   recover a rebel from total depravity and enmity against God and his
   law, to obedience and holiness; and infinite condescension and
   goodness. All this is ascribed to the Redeemer in the holy scripture,
   as has been shown. And surely none can believe all this, and rely with
   confidence on the Redeemer for such redemption, who does not believe
   him to be truly God, infinitely great, honourable, powerful, wise and
   good.

   They who have such a low and dishonourable idea of the divine
   character, his law and moral government, as to believe sin to be
   infinitely less criminal than it really is, that it is not infinitely
   odious and criminal, and does not deserve infinite natural evil as the
   just punishment of it; That it is not necessary that the threatening of
   the law should be in any sense executed, in order to the maintenance of
   public truth and righteousness: That man is not so depraved but that he
   may recover himself from sin to holiness when proper methods are taken
   with him, and motives set before him to induce him to repent, and
   renounce his rebellion, without any supernatural renovation by the
   Spirit of God; and that in this wav he may obtain forgiveness, and
   recommend himself to the divine favour, so as to obtain eternal life:
   They who have such wrong notions of God, and his law, of sin and of
   themselves, do not, and cannot see the need of a divine person, of one
   that is really the true God united to the human nature, to be the
   Redeemer of men: Therefore they cannot believe that Jesus Christ is
   such an one. Consequently they read the Bible under this prejudice, and
   find things there which appear to them contrary to the real divinity of
   Christ. They greedily catch at them, and make the best use of them they
   can, in their opposition to that doctrine; at the same time, exerting
   all their abilities to show the unreasonableness and absurdity of such
   a doctrine, and in the most plausible manner possible to explain away
   those passages of scripture, which are understood by those who believe
   in the divinity of the Redeemer of man, plainly to assert this
   doctrine; and to make them consistent with his being a mere creature.
   This appears to be the case with the Arians and Socinians, both in
   former ages, and in this, who join in the denial of the divinity of
   Christ, though they differ in other things respecting him; the former
   holding that he is the first and greatest creature that God has made,
   who after he had existed thousands of years a mere spirit, took a body
   in the womb of the Virgin Mary, and was born of her, &c. The latter
   suppose he had no existence before he was conceived and brought forth
   by the virgin, his mother.

   But others, who view the divine character, and the law of God, the
   nature and desert of sin, the depravity, and lost, undone state of man,
   in the scriptural light in which they have been set in the preceding
   part of this system, are prepared to see their need of such a Redeemer
   as the Bible reveals; they consult that, and find that he is there
   declared to be "God with us," God, who created, and upholds all things,
   manifest in the flesh; that he has given his life a ransom for sinners;
   has been made a curse to deliver men from the curse, dying for their
   sins; that he has obeyed the divine law in its requirements; that he is
   risen from the dead, and exalted to the right hand of the Father, able
   effectually to draw men unto him, and to save to the uttermost all them
   who come to God by him. They believe and are sure, and address him as
   Nathaniel did, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel."
   And as Thomas, "My Lord; and my God." And say with the beloved
   disciple, "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
   understanding that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that
   is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal
   life." And they rest satisfied in the natural and plain sense of the
   words of this same John, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
   was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and
   dwelt among us; and we beheld his glory, as of the only begotten of the
   Father, full of grace and truth."

   II. From the view we have had, by attending to the Bible, of the
   atonement for sin made by Christ, we learn, that they have made a great
   mistake, who think that this consists wholly in the obedience of the
   Redeemer; and that his sufferings, as such, and as distinguished from
   his obedience, are no part of the atonement: And therefore that he did
   not in any sense suffer the penalty of the law, in whole or in part;
   nor had his sufferings any direct reference to this; and answered no
   end, except that hereby his love to God and man, was exercised in a
   higher degree, and his obedience was more tried and conspicuous by
   obeying unto death, than if he had not been obliged thus to suffer.

   This notion of the atonement entirely excludes and denies the real
   atonement, clearly and abundantly stated and taught in the scriptures;
   and places it in that in which it does not consist. Therefore as this
   error wholly subverts the true scripture doctrine of the atonement of
   Christ, it is great, dangerous, and hurtful, in proportion to the
   importance and necessity of an atonement, and of believing and
   confiding in that atonement, which, according to divine revelation, is
   the only foundation of the hope of a christian.

   If the threatening and penalty of the law may be disregarded, and set
   aside, so as to pass wholly unexecuted, in order to pardon and favour
   the transgressor, without any vicarious sufferings of another in his
   stead, it will be difficult, and doubtless impossible, to show or see
   why a vicarious obedience to the precepts of the law is necessary in
   order to the sinner's salvation. And why the obedience only of the
   Redeemer should be a sufficient ground, or any reason at all, why man
   should be delivered from the curse of the law, it is presumed no one
   can tell; or why it was necessary that a substitute should obey the law
   in man's stead, if there was no need of his suffering the penalty also.
   Upon this plan there appears to be no need of a Redeemer, unless it be
   to reveal the mercy of God to sinners, and his readiness to pardon and
   save all who repent and return to obedience, and persevere therein: And
   to set an example of holy obedience, and to lay down his life in
   confirmation of the truths which he had taught: And what need there is
   that the Redeemer should be more than a mere man, in order to do all
   this, it is believed, none can tell. The Socinian's Redeemer is
   therefore equal to the whole of this work.

   III. We farther learn what a great delusion they embrace, who think
   they, in their own persons, are become innocent and worthy, by the
   atonement and obedience of Christ: That his sufferings and obedience
   are so imputed to them, that they are really become their own
   sufferings and obedience; that his righteousness and holiness is in
   such a sense and degree, their own righteousness and holiness, that
   they themselves are, in the sight of God, perfectly innocent and holy.
   And some go so far as to say they have no ill desert or sin; nor can
   they sin, let them do what they will. This is to a dreadful degree,
   perverting the doctrine of the atonement of Christ, and his work, as
   the Redeemer of sinners, and of pardon and justification through him.

   It has been shewn, that the sinner who is interested in the atonement
   of Christ, and is delivered from the curse of the law, is left as ill
   deserving as he ever was, in his own person; and this his ill desert,
   never will, or can be removed. And it is equally true, that the sinner
   who is interested in all the merit and worthiness of Christ, and is for
   the sake of that, justified, and made heir of eternal life, is still as
   unworthy as ever in himself, in his own person, of the least favour: as
   unworthy as he could be, if the Redeemer had merited nothing for him,
   or he had no interest in his righteousness; and must remain so, and
   know that he is so, forever; And the least thought to the contrary
   would be infinitely criminal, and a most ungrateful and horrid abuse of
   the atonement and righteousness of Christ.

   Every thing contrary to the divine law, in the believer, is his own
   sin, and as criminal, as if he had no interest in the righteousness of
   Christ; and much more so. What the Redeemer has done and suffered is
   imputed to him; that is, is reckoned in his favour, so that he has the
   benefit of it, as much as if it were his own; and it avails to obtain
   deliverance, from the curse of the law, for him, and eternal life: But
   it leaves him as unworthy of any favour, as deserving of eternal
   destruction, and as great a criminal as he ever was.

   IV. The work of the Mediator, and his design in it, as it has been now
   considered, brings into view his wonderful love and grace, which is
   exercised towards man.

   In order to have an adequate view of this, we must rise in our
   conceptions to the height from which he descended; and comprehend his
   greatness, worthiness and glory; and then take a full and comprehensive
   view of the depth to which he descended in his humiliation; and the
   magnitude of the evil which he suffered, in order to redeem man. But
   this is absolutely impossible to men or angels; therefore, the love of
   Christ never will be fully known by angels, or the redeemed: For it
   "passeth knowledge," as inspiration has declared. This, therefore, must
   be an endless theme, and has laid a foundation for endless progression
   in knowledge, love and happiness. The more the redeemed shall know of
   Christ, the greater view they will have of the evil which he suffered
   for their redemption. This infinitely exceeds all instances of love
   among creatures. This will be exhibited forever, as infinitely the
   greatest instance of love and grace in the universe, except the love of
   the Father, in giving his Son; which w ill be celebrated by the
   redeemed, and all the friends of God, without end. St. Paul dwelt on
   this theme, when on earth. "I live, said he, by the faith of the Son of
   God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." [487] "Walk in love, as
   Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us." [488] "Ye
   know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet
   for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
   rich." [489]

   The love of Christ, exercised towards sinners, is great in proportion
   to the greatness of the evil he suffered for their redemption. The
   latter is infinite, so therefore is the former. And though he sought
   the glory of God, and the general good, in what he did and suffered,
   yet his love to sinners is not in the least diminished, or the less, by
   reason of this: For he gave himself for them. "Unto him that loved us,
   and washed us from our sins, in his own blood. And hath made us kings
   and priests unto God and his Father; to Him be glory and dominion,
   forever and ever, Amen." [490]

   [420] The paschal lamb was an eminent type of Christ, with a principal
   reference to which he is so often called "The Lamb, the Lamb of God."
   Therefore he is called the christian's passover. "For even Christ our
   passover is sacrificed for us." [1 Cor. v. 7.] This lamb was slain, and
   roasted with fire, as an emblem of the sufferings and death of Christ.
   There was a particular direction and command respecting the blood of
   this lamb. "And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
   side posts, and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they
   shall eat it.--And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the
   houses where you are: And when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
   and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the
   land of Egypt." [Exod. xii. 7, 13.] As the blood of this slain lamb,
   when applied according to divine direction, secured the Israelites from
   the destruction which fell on the Egyptians; so Christ was slain and
   sacrificed, that they to whom his blood is applied by their believing
   in him, may have their sins forgiven, and be secured from that
   destruction which they deserve, being delivered from the wrath to come.

   [446] In the view of the infinite natural evil there is in the
   sufferings and death of the Son of God, may be seen the magnitude of
   the crime of which the Jews and all who joined with them, were guilty,
   who were active in bringing this evil upon him; who condemned, reviled
   and mocked him, inflicted pain and distress upon him, and put him to an
   ignominious and most cruel death. The crime of all sin is great in some
   proportion to the magnitude of the natural evil which is effected by
   it, or which it tends to produce. In this instance, the natural evil
   which they effected is infinite; therefore their crime in doing this
   was infinite, that is, they hereby rendered themselves infinitely
   guilty and ill deserving. It was just, that they should suffer as great
   and as much natural evil, as their volitions did actually produce, or
   tended to produce. And all who have reproached and slighted the
   Redeemer, all who have opposed and rejected him, from that time to this
   day, have really joined with those who put him to death, and in their
   hearts say, "Let him be crucified," and are guilty of that which is
   infinitely criminal, and deserve to have infinite evil inflicted upon
   them. And in this instance of the sin of men, actually producing
   infinite natural evil, is to be seen the infinitely evil and malignant
   nature of all sin It tends to produce infinite natural evil; and
   therefore the sinner deserves to have this evil inflicted upon him,
   which has been before observed.

   [465] John viii. 12. xii. 46. These words of Christ serve to explain
   what is said by this Evangelist, [Chap. i. 5.] "Who was the true light,
   which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." The words of
   Christ suppose, and implicitly assert, that he who believeth not, is in
   darkness, and abideth in darkness. And this Apostle asserts the same
   thing. He says, "He that hateth his brother (which is true of every
   unbeliever) is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, because that
   darkness hath blinded his eyes." [1 John 2.] Therefore Christ's
   lightening every man that cometh into the world, cannot mean that he
   actually illuminates the mind of every man in the world, for the words
   of Christ, and of his beloved disciple, assert the contrary. The
   meaning therefore must be, either that he lightens every man in the
   world without exception, who has any true light; that is, all who
   believe, and come to the light: Or that he is the only objective light
   in the world; there being no other light to be seen, but that which he
   affords objectively: which objective light is set before all men, and
   is offered to all, in a greater or less degree. It nevertheless remains
   true that all who are not christians, and do not follow Christ, have no
   light within them, but walk in total darkness, from which they are
   turned when they believe. Therefore Christ says, "I am the light of the
   world. He that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
   the light of life." [John viii. 12] This implies that all who do not
   follow him, have no degree of that light of which he speaks, when he
   says, "I am the light of the world;" but are wholly involved in that
   darkness which is opposed to this light; and live and walk in it.

  ON THE APPLICATION OF REDEMPTION.
     __________________________________________________________________

Section I.

   On the Application of Redemption in general.

   THE first Adam was united to all his posterity as their father, head,
   and constituted representative and substitute; and all mankind were
   united to him, as such. This may be considered, both as a natural and
   constituted union; by which all his children were to have the benefit
   of his obedience, as much as if it were their own personal obedience,
   should he obey through the time of his trial; so that his holiness
   should insure perfect, everlasting holiness and happiness to them: And,
   on the other hand, his disobedience should descend to them, and make
   them sinners, and entail sin and ruin on all his posterity; so that
   their sin, guilt and ruin, were connected with his rebellion, and, in
   this sense, his sin, was their sin.

   The second Adam has no such natural union with mankind, as their
   natural father and head, and they have no union to him in this way: But
   they must, in some way and manner, be united to him, and he to them, in
   order to his becoming their head and representative, so as to share in
   the saving benefits of his atonement and righteousness. He is
   constituted by God a public head and representative, as the first Adam
   was, and is substituted to obey and suffer for man; but in order to
   their being actually interested in the benefit of his atonement and
   righteousness, they must be united to him, and he to them, so as to be
   in a sense one, as the head and members of the natural body are one.
   This union, by divine constitution and appointment, is to take place
   and consist in a mutual voluntary consent; the Redeemer offering
   himself to them, and they consenting and complying with his proposal
   and offer, and accepting of him, and trusting in him as their Redeemer.
   This lays the foundation for a treaty with mankind; in the prosecution
   of which, redemption is actually applied; not to all mankind, but to
   those who cordially embrace the offer, and accept of Christ, and
   salvation by him. This is particularly stated in the scripture. Christ
   says, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." [491] These words suppose, and implicitly assert, that none but
   believers are to be saved by the Redeemer, as no others have that
   relation to him, and union with him, which is necessary, in order to
   give them an interest in redemption by him. This Christ expressly
   asserted, when he commissioned the apostles to go forth and treat with
   men, in order to effect the application of his redemption; without
   which no man could be saved. "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the
   world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and
   is baptised, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be
   damned." [492]

   As all mankind are united to Adam, as his posterity, his seed; so
   Christ has a seed, a posterity, who are by their union to him, made the
   children of God, and joint heirs with him, to whom the promise of
   salvation is made. These are not all mankind, but believers in him. For
   thus saith the scripture. "The children of the promise are counted for
   the seed. Know ye, therefore, that they which are of faith, the same
   are the children of Abraham. For ye are all the children of God, by
   faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into
   Christ, have put on Christ. And if ye be Christ's, then ye are
   Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise; heirs of God, and
   joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the
   children of the promise." [493]

   The Redeemer has made an atonement sufficient to expiate for the sins
   of the whole world; and, in this sense, has tasted death for every man,
   has taken away the sin of the world, has given himself a ransom for
   all, and is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, so that
   whosoever believeth in him may be saved, and God can now be just, and
   the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Therefore, the gospel is
   ordered to be preached to the whole world, to all nations, to every
   human creature: And the offer of salvation by Christ is to be made to
   every one, with this declaration, that whosoever believeth, is willing
   to accept of it, shall be delivered from the curse of the law, and have
   eternal life.

   But as all mankind are totally depraved, and are become enemies to God,
   his law and government, and consequently equal enemies to the Redeemer,
   and salvation by him, they are all prepared and disposed to refuse to
   accept of the offered salvation, and reject it with their whole hearts,
   whatever motives are set before them, and methods taken to persuade
   them to comply. This lays the foundation of the necessity of the
   renovation of the hearts of men by the holy Spirit, in order to their
   believing and embracing the gospel; of which the scripture speaks
   abundantly. Christ taught, that except a man be born of the spirit, he
   cannot enter into the kingdom of God, or so much as see it. St. Paul
   says, that all believers are the subjects of the mighty power of God,
   operating upon them, by which they have been brought to believe: That
   they, being naturally dead in trespasses and sins, have been made alive
   by God; and that faith is the gift of God; that they are saved not by
   any works of righteousness which they have done, but by the washing of
   regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; so that it is not of him
   that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God who sheweth mercy,
   and worketh in them by his Spirit, to will and to run, &c. &c.

   By this renovation, men are said in scripture to be made new creatures,
   and to be created in Christ, unto good works; and believers are said to
   be in Christ, and to put on Christ. This union of the believer to
   Christ may be considered as consisting in two things, viz. 1. In
   Christ's uniting himself to him by his Spirit, by which he takes
   possession of him, is formed in him, and dwells in him: And by the
   Spirit of God, the believer is drawn to him. "No man cometh unto me,
   says Christ, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him." 2. In
   the believer's uniting himself to Christ, by actually cleaving to him,
   trusting in him, and loving him; all which is implied in saying faith,
   or believing on Christ; and which is also implied in Christ's uniting
   himself to the believer, mentioned in the foregoing particular. This
   union is begun in regeneration and conversion, by which Christ, by his
   Spirit, takes possession of the heart, produces faith and christian
   holiness; in the exercise of which, the believer cleaves to Christ in
   holy love. But of these it is proposed to treat more particularly in
   some following sections.

   This union between Christ and believers in him, is represented by a
   variety of similitudes in scripture. It is represented by a building
   composed of stones, all resting on a chief corner stone, which bears up
   the whole. By the natural body, consisting of head and members, all
   united to the head; the life and every function of the body, and each
   of the members depending upon their union with the head, and being
   derived from that: It is compared to the union of the food and drink,
   to the stomach and body, being taken into that, and digested, and
   thereby spreading life and spirit through the whole, for its constant
   support. "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
   blood, ye have no life in you. Whosoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh
   my blood, hath eternal life." [494] It is illustrated by the union of
   the branch with the vine, by which the former derives life, sap and
   nourishment from the latter. "I am the vine, ye are the branches."
   [495] To mention no more, it is frequently represented by the union
   between the husband and the wife, which is a voluntary or a moral
   union, and by which the wife shares in the dignity, goods and
   possessions of her husband, and receives protection and support from
   him. The church is therefore called "the bride, the Lamb's wife."
   Believers, by their union to Christ, receive the benefit of his
   sufferings and obedience, and are made rich, partaking in all his
   fulness; and become joint heirs with him of eternal inheritance.

   The union between Christ and believers is a moral and spiritual union:
   In this respect, "He who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit." [496]
   It is an imperfect union in the beginning of it: It is therefore a
   growing union, until it shall be made perfect; it being a lasting
   union, which shall continue forever. And when this becomes perfect,
   which it will not, in its most complete state, till the resurrection,
   there will be a full and perfect participation of redemption by Christ;
   and that prayer of Christ will then be completely answered. "Neither
   pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
   through their word: That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in
   me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us. And the glory which
   thou gavest me, I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as
   we are one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
   one. That the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I
   in them." [497]

Section II.

   On Regeneration.

   IT has been observed, that mankind being naturally under the power of
   sin and total depravity, it is necessary that they should be the
   subjects of a renovation by the Spirit of God, in order to their union
   to Christ, and being redeemed by him. It is proposed now to attend more
   particularly to this renovation, as it is represented in the holy
   scriptures.

   Regeneration and conversion are often used only as two words, meaning
   the same thing; and it is certain that all that can be properly
   understood by them, is that change and renovation which is expressed in
   scripture, by being born again, born of the Spirit of God, and born of
   God, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works, &c. Yet, as there are
   two distinct things included in this change, which it is necessary
   should be distinguished, in order to understand this subject, these
   words may be properly used, to make and keep up this distinction, as
   many divines have done. In this renovation, there is the operation of
   the cause, which is the work done by the Spirit of God; and there is
   the effect, which consists in the exercises of the regenerate, in which
   they are active, and agents. Though these imply each other, and cannot
   be separated, more than the cause can be separated from the effect; yet
   they must be distinguished, and the former may properly be called
   regeneration. In order to explain this, and prevent mistakes concerning
   it, the following things must be observed.

   1. The Spirit of God is the only agent and cause by whose energy the
   effect takes place; and so far as the Spirit of God, is the cause and
   agent, the subject, the heart of man, is passive, being the subject on
   which, or in which, the effect is wrought. Though the effect be
   activity, or the exercise of the new heart, in which the renewed person
   is the agent; yet, in the operation which causes the effect to exist,
   and therefore in the order of nature, is antecedent to the effect, the
   Spirit of God is the only agent, and man is the passive subject.

   2. This change, of which the Spirit of God is the cause, and in which
   he is the only agent, is instantaneous; wrought not gradually, but at
   once. The human heart is either a heart of stone, a rebellious heart,
   or a new heart. The man is either under the dominion of sin, as
   obstinate and vile as ever, dead in trespasses and sins; or his heart
   is humble and penitent; he is a new creature, and spiritually alive.
   There can be no instant of time, in which the heart is neither a hard
   heart, nor a new heart, and the man is neither dead in trespasses and
   sins, nor spiritually alive. The Spirit of God finds the heart of man
   wholly corrupt, and desperately wicked, wholly and strongly, even with
   all the power he has, opposed to God and his law, and to that
   renovation which he produces. The enmity of the heart against God
   continues as strong as ever it was, till it is slain by the
   instantaneous energy of the divine Spirit, and from carnal it becomes
   spiritual, betwixt which there is no medium, according to scripture and
   reason. All the exercises of the hard, impenitent, unrenewed heart, are
   exercises of impenitence and rebellion, of enmity against God and his
   law; whatever the external conduct may be, they are the corrupt fruit
   of a corrupt, rebellious heart. The exercises and fruit of a heart,
   dead in trespasses and sins, are dead works. If this were not
   demonstrably certain from the nature of the case, it is abundantly
   asserted in the scripture, and our Saviour has decided it in the most
   express manner. His words are, "Either make the tree good, and his
   fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt. A
   good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good
   things: And an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
   things." [498] St. Paul repeatedly asserts the same thing. By a number
   of quotations from the Old Testament, he proves that all men are by
   nature, altogether, and to a great degree, corrupt; that there is
   nothing morally good in them, or done by them. [499] He asserts that
   antecedent to regeneration, man does nothing morally good; that all of
   this kind is the consequence of it. "We are his workmanship, created in
   Christ Jesus unto good works." [500] And again he says, "We ourselves
   also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers
   lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
   another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour
   appeared, not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but
   according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost." [501] Here he describes their state and
   moral character, which is the character of all men, antecedent to
   regeneration. He denies their having done any good works; but, on the
   contrary, says, all their works were evil, and gives them a very bad
   character. He then ascribes all their reformation, and the alteration
   of their character for the better, to their regeneration, by which
   alone they were washed from their moral pollutions.

   3. The subject of this operation, in which this change and effect is
   wrought, is the will or the heart; that is, the moral and not the
   natural powers and faculties of the soul. As moral depravity is wholly
   in the will or heart, the source and seat of all moral actions, the
   divine operation directly respects the heart, and consists in changing
   and renewing that. The understanding or intellect, considered as
   distinct from the will, is a natural Faculty, and is not capable of
   moral depravity. It may be hurt and weakened, and improved to bad
   purposes, as other natural faculties may, by the moral corruption or
   sinfulness of the heart: But nothing is necessary, in order to remove
   the disorders of the intellect, and all the natural powers of the soul,
   but the renovation of the heart; so far as the will is right, the
   understanding, considered as a natural faculty, will be rectified, and
   do its office well. Therefore regeneration is in scripture represented
   as consisting in giving a new heart, a heart to know the Lord, &c. The
   scripture indeed speaks of the understanding being enlightened; and of
   its being darkened; and of being without understanding, as criminal;
   and represents a good understanding, as comprehending all virtue or
   holiness. But the understanding in these instances is not considered
   and spoken of as mere intellect, distinct from the will or heart; but
   as comprehending and principally intending the heart, which is the seat
   of all moral perception and exercise. In scripture the distinction
   between the understanding and the heart is not often made; but the
   former is generally spoken of as implying the latter, and consisting in
   that discerning, which is implied in right exercises of heart; and
   cannot take place any farther than the heart is renewed, and the will
   is right. Therefore we read of "a wise and understanding heart." And
   wisdom and understanding are words frequently used in scripture as
   nearly synonymous, and denoting die same thing: But wisdom belongs to
   the heart, and is of a moral nature; and that in which, according to
   the scripture, true holiness consists.

   All moral, criminal darkness, has its scat in the heart, as all sin
   has, and the former cannot be distinguished from the latter; and
   selfishness is the essence of both. And on the contrary, all true light
   and understanding, which is of a moral nature, belongs to the heart,
   and implies real holiness, and cannot be separated, and even
   distinguished from it, as one necessarily implies and involves the
   other. This is asserted by our divine teacher in the following words:
   "The light of the body is the eye: If therefore thine eye be single,
   thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy
   whole body shall be full of darkness." [502] The single and evil eye
   are opposites, and belong to the heart, and consist in the exercises of
   that. This is said by Christ of the evil eye. "For from within, out of
   the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,
   murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
   evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come
   from within, and defile the man." [503] Here an evil eye, which fills
   the mind with darkness, and is darkness itself, is numbered among the
   evil things which belong to the corrupt heart, and of which that is the
   source, and is altogether criminal. And, consequently, the single eye,
   which is opposite to the evil eye, must also belong to the heart, and
   consists in that which is real holiness, or which implies it. Where
   this is, the man is full of light.

   Therefore, in regeneration, the heart being changed and renewed, light
   and understanding take place; and there is no need of any operation on
   the understanding, or intellectual faculty of the mind, as
   distinguished from the heart, or any change in that, which does not
   necessarily take place, upon the renovation of the w ill or heart.

   As the moral disorder and depravity of man lies wholly in his heart,
   the cure and renovation must begin and end there; and when the heart is
   perfectly right, the man will be wholly recovered to perfect holiness.

   This point is particularly observed and stated, to expose and rectify a
   mistake which has been too often made, representing regeneration as
   consisting: chiefly, if not wholly, in renewing the understanding, as
   distinguished from the will, and letting light into that, antecedent to
   any change of the heart, and in order to it; and by which light in the
   understanding, the will is inclined and turned from sin to holiness.
   This is turning this matter upside down, and has a dangerous and bad
   tendency. It supposes that human depravity lies in the understanding,
   and not in the will; or, at least, that it has its foundation and
   beginning in the former; and that when that comes right, the will or
   heart acts right, of course. The consequence is, that there is little
   or no moral depravity in the heart, that being ready to do its office
   well, when the understanding is set right: Therefore, man is not
   blameable for his depravity, and not being holy, since his blindness,
   which alone, is in the way of his acting right, is not dependent on his
   will, ©r owing to any disorders in that. It is, indeed, imposable to
   give true moral light and understanding to the depraved mind of man, by
   any operation whatsoever on the intellect, antecedent to the renovation
   of the will; for the darkness is in the latter, and consists in the
   wrong inclination of that; and therefore cannot be removed, but by
   renewing the heart.

   Others have supposed, that there is in regeneration, an operation on
   the understanding, or intellect first, in order to enlighten the mind;
   and then by divine energy, the will is renewed, and brought to comply
   with the light let into the understanding. But this is unscriptural and
   contrary to the nature and order of things; and tends to lead to
   hurtful mistakes, as has been observed. Nothing is necessary but the
   renovation of the w ill, in order to set every thing right in the human
   soul: And if the will be not renewed, or a new heart be not given, by
   an immediate operation, no operation on any other faculty of the soul,
   and no supposable or possible change can set the heart right, or renew
   it in the least degree. The scripture makes no such distinction between
   the faculties of the soul in treating of this matter; but represents
   the renovation of the will, or giving a new heart, as setting the whole
   soul right in all the powers and faculties of it.

   4. The divine operation in regeneration, of which the new heart is the
   effect, is immediate, or it is not wrought by the energy of any means
   as the cause of it; but by the immediate power and energy of the Holy
   Spirit. It is called a creation, and the divine agency in it is as much
   without any medium, as in creating something from nothing. Men are not
   regenerated in the sense in which we are now considering regeneration,
   by light or the word of God. This is evident from what has been
   observed under the last particular. If the evil eye, which is total
   darkness, and shuts all the light out, be the evil, corrupt heart of
   man; then this corrupt heart must be renewed, in order to there being
   any true light in the mind, and previous to it. There must be a
   discerning heart, which is the same with a new heart, in order to see
   the light; and therefore this cannot be produced by light. The evil
   eye, which shuts out all the light, cannot be cured, and made a single
   eye, by seeing the light: And the light cannot have any effect, or
   answer any end, till they are so far made single, as to admit the
   light: Therefore, that operation which changes the evil eye to a single
   eye, cannot be by means of light; but must take place antecedent to any
   light, or any influence or effect that can be produced by it. It is
   said the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that she attended unto the
   things that were spoken by Paul. It would be a contradiction, and very
   absurd, to say, that the word spoken by Paul, was that by which her
   heart was opened; for she knew not what he did speak, until her heart
   was opened to attend to his words, and understand them. Her heart was
   first opened, in order to his words having any effect, or giving any
   light to her. And this must be done by an immediate operation of the
   Spirit of God on her heart. This was the regeneration now under
   consideration, by which her heart was renewed, and formed to true
   discerning, like the single eye.

   St. James says, "Of his own will begat he us, with the word of truth."
   [504] But here in regeneration he includes the effect wrought, or
   conversion, and does not mean only the act by which the effect is
   produced, as distinguished from the effect, which is intended by the
   regeneration now under consideration. The effect produced by the
   regenerating energy of the Spirit of God, in the adult, is active
   conversion, which supposes light and truth in the discerning mind, and
   exercises answerable to it; which is to be particularly considered,
   under the next general head.

   5. The divine operation in the regeneration of which we are speaking,
   though very great and powerful, is altogether imperceptible by the
   subject on whom the work is wrought, and by which he is regenerated.
   Nothing is perceived but the effect, which in the adult consists in
   perception of truth, and answerable exercises. The cause is to be
   learned and known only by the effect. When Adam was created, he
   perceived nothing, and was conscious of nothing, but his own existence,
   perceptions and exercises. The divine operation, which was the cause of
   his existence, was over and finished, before he began to perceive any
   thing. Every creature is constantly supported by God, and divine energy
   attends and is exerted in all our motions and actions; "For in him we
   live and move, (or which is more agreeable to the original, are moved)
   and have our being." "And the inspiration of the Almighty giveth us
   understanding." Yet we perceive nothing but the effect, and argue the
   cause from the effect. So it is in this case. "The wind bloweth where
   it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of
   the Spirit." [505]

   6. The grace granted in regeneration is a sovereign, undeserved and
   unpromised favour.

   The sinner, who is the chosen subject of this operation, and object of
   this favour, is infinitely ill deserving; and is disposed to go on in
   rebellion, till this change is wrought. He is obstinate, and refuses to
   hearken to the divine command, to repent and embrace the gospel, and
   the offer of mercy, whatever methods have been taken with him to
   reclaim him. However much he may be terrified with the fears of
   threatened destruction, and the evil, dangerous state in which he is;
   and though he may have earnest desires to escape misery, and be happy
   forever; and may make many prayers, and do many things, he has not the
   least inclination to repent, submit to God and accept of offered mercy;
   but directly contrary to all this, he with his whole heart abuses every
   favour granted to him, rejects the offer of mercy, opposes God, slights
   Christ, and resists the Holy Ghost, in all his prayers, and in all he
   does; for still his heart is ii heart of stone, an impenitent,
   rebellious heart, and is full of enmity against God. This character is
   given of all the unregenerate, in the scripture. Therefore he is not
   only undeserving of any favour, and especially of this, and infinitely
   ill deserving; but is constantly provoking God to give him up to utter
   destruction. When the sinner is in this situation, God has mercy on
   him, and by his Spirit gives him a new heart. Surely this is, in the
   highest sense, sovereign mercy; God is infinitely far from being under
   obligation to any sinner to do this for him: "Therefore hath he mercy
   on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."

   And God has not obliged himself by any promise to grant this mercy to
   any individual person, antecedent to his actually doing it. He has made
   no promise, in his word, to those who do not accept nor desire the
   mercy and salvation which he offers, but reject it with their whole
   heart; which is true of all the unregenerate, as has been observed.
   There are indeed promises made to the church, that God will pour out
   his Spirit, and regenerate sinners; but no individual, unconverted
   sinner can claim this promise, as it is not made to him in particular.
   There are promises made to those who repent and believe the gospel,
   that they shall be saved, that the Spirit of God shall dwell in them
   forever, &c. but the regenerating influences of the Spirit, which are
   antecedent to faith, and the first act of faith, which is the gift of
   God, are unpromised gifts and favours; and God cannot be under any
   obligation to those who receive them by promise, or any other way.

   7. The divine operation, by which men are regenerated, and a new heart
   is given, is not in the least degree inconsistent with human liberty;
   nor does it impede or obstruct it, in any respect: But finds and leaves
   men in the free exercise of all desirable or possible freedom, and
   wholly blameable for all the exercises of their heart, not conformable
   to the law of God; and commendable for all right exercises of the new
   heart; which are as much their own, and as free, as if they had taken
   place without any divine influences, were this possible.

   This is evident and certain, if liberty consists in voluntary action,
   or in the choice and exercises of the will, and in nothing else. No
   compulsion can be offered to the will, or the freedom of it be any way
   affected by any operation or influence on the mind which takes place
   antecedent to the exercise of the will, and in order to the choice that
   is made. Man is active only in willing; and in this only consists his
   moral freedom. And in this he is not capable of compulsion; and no
   impression that is made upon him, nor any operation whatsoever can take
   away his liberty in the least degree, unless it obstructs and is
   inconsistent with his acting voluntarily: For so far, and so long, as
   he does this, and puts forth acts of will, they are his own acts, and
   he is free; and enjoys and exercises all the freedom of which there can
   be any consistent conception, or that is possible in the nature of
   things. [See Part I. Chap. 4, page 174, &c.] Antecedent to regeneration
   man acts freely. With great strength of inclination and choice his
   heart opposes the law of God, and rejects the gospel, seeking himself
   wholly. And when the instantaneous, immediate energy of the holy Spirit
   renews his heart, he turns about, and loves and chooses what he hated
   before; and exercises as real freedom in his choice and pursuit of that
   which he had opposed and rejected.

   8. Regeneration is but the beginning of a divine operation which does
   not wholly renew the heart at once; but from this small beginning the
   operation continues and goes on to perfection, that is, till the heart
   is made perfectly clean and holy; which w ill not be accomplished till
   death. For God continues to work in the regenerate to will and to do,
   and they are as dependant on divine influence for every after right
   exercise of will, as for the first. And God who begins this' good work
   in them will perform it, and go on with it, until the day of Jesus
   Christ. [506]

Section III.

   On Conversion.

   THE effect of the regenerating influence of the Spirit of God, which
   consists in conversion, is next to be more particularly considered.

   Regeneration, in the sense in which it has now been considered, is the
   cause of voluntary action in him who is the subject of the operation,
   or issues in it; which consists in turning from sin to God, or in holy
   exercise, which is true love to God, and loving our neighbour as
   ourselves; which implies a sight and belief of the truth, repentance,
   faith in Christ, and submission and devotedness to him, his interest
   and service, &c. As the law of God requires love, and nothing but love,
   considered as comprehending all the proper and genuine fruits and
   expressions of it; so the new creature, or that which is born of God,
   consists wholly in love, as it is conformity to the law of God, which
   is all comprehended in these two commands, "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind. And thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Therefore St. John
   says, "He that loveth is born of God. God is love, and he that dwelleth
   in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. "As God is love, and this
   comprehends the whole of his moral character; so love in creatures, is
   the moral image of God, and it consists altogether in this. This love,
   of which God and the creature are the objects, is, in the nature of it,
   one and the same undivided affection, differing only as it is exercised
   towards different objects, on various occasions, and in diverse
   circumstances. It consists in universal benevolence; or benevolence to
   being in general capable of happiness, and all that affection and
   exercise of heart which is necessarily included in this. Universal
   benevolence, or goodness, is necessarily pleased with good and
   happiness wherever it takes place; for it seeks the general good, and
   that to the greatest possible degree; it must therefore be gratified,
   wherever happiness takes place, and that in proportion to the degree of
   it. And, of consequence, it must be pleased with every benevolent
   being, who wishes the greatest general good, and promotes it, according
   to his capacity, and the opportunity he has to do it. Therefore
   benevolence must have the greatest degree of pleasure in that being who
   has the greatest degree of benevolence, and does the most good. And
   this is the love of complacence, and is necessarily implied in
   benevolence, and really an exercise of it, and can take place no where
   but in the benevolent heart. Benevolence esteems benevolent affection,
   as the greatest excellence and worth; and therefore exercises the
   highest love of esteem towards him who has the greatest degree of
   benevolence, and does the most good. And the benevolent person
   exercises true gratitude towards every being who is doing good to
   individuals, and promoting the greatest general or public good. Thus
   complacential love, the love of esteem and the love of gratitude, are
   included in benevolence, and essential to it; and are really nothing
   more than benevolent affection. He who has universal benevolence has
   all virtuous, holy love, as all is necessarily implied and comprehended
   in this. The new, benevolent heart, is an illuminated heart. The eye is
   now become single, and all is full of light. The person is now turned
   from darkness to marvellous light, and being spiritual, discerneth and
   knoweth all things. He sees and believes the great truths contained in
   divine revelation; and cordially embraces them as true and excellent.

   This holy affection, in which the new creature consists, discerns the
   being and perfections of God, as realities and glorious, as they were
   never seen before. And this holy love is fixed, in the first place, on
   this sum and fountain of all being, benevolence and perfection, as the
   supreme object of benevolent affection. Here the benevolent heart finds
   an object every way, and in all respects, suited to draw forth the
   strongest exercises of benevolent, friendly affection, in rejoicing in
   his infinite, eternal, independent existence, felicity and glory;
   exercising and enjoying supreme delight, and complacential love in his
   infinite perfection and benevolence; and sweet gratitude to him for the
   glorious exercise and display of his love; devoting himself to his
   service and honour, and exerting cordial and strong benevolence and
   friendship, in ardently desiring that God may be glorified to the
   highest degree forever; and wishing to be the active instrument of
   this, as the greatest happiness he can desire, or imagine.

   The new heart sees and approves of the divine law in the extent and
   spirituality of it, requiring perfect love to God and man; and
   threatening disobedience with infinite evil; and it is agreeable to him
   that this law should be maintained and honoured forever. And in this
   light he sees his own total depravity, and the unsearchable wickedness
   of his heart. He beholds the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and its
   desert of infinite evil, as a proper punishment. He hence sees his own
   infinite odiousness and ill desert, and condemns and abhors himself for
   all his transgressions, and contrariety to God and his law: And
   confesses his sins, repenting as in dust and ashes. The new heart is
   therefore a broken, contrite, humble, penitent heart. True repentance
   is necessarily implied in real conversion; and therefore the whole of
   conversion is often in scripture expressed by it, and called
   repentance. And this continues and increases through the whole life of
   a real convert. [507]

   The new man discerns the character of Christ, and the way of salvation
   by him, with entire approbation, and great pleasure, and believes the
   gospel with all his heart, and flies to the Redeemer, as the only hope
   for sinners; trusting in him alone for pardon, righteousness, strength
   and redemption. And his benevolent love to God and man is in the
   highest degree pleased with the gospel, which establishes, magnifies
   and honours the law, and brings honour to God in the pardon and
   salvation of sinful, lost men, who believe on the Saviour. Conversion
   is turning from a state of obstinacy and disobedience, to a cordial
   submission and obedience to Christ. The real convert says as Saul did
   when he was renewed, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" This is
   necessarily implied in repentance and faith. A new heart is an obedient
   heart; therefore obedience cannot be separated from a new heart; and
   they are indeed one and the same thing. Consequently they are put
   together as implying each other, and being really the same in the words
   of inspiration. "A new heart will I give you, and I will put my Spirit
   within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my
   judgments, and do them." [508] The new heart consists in love, as has
   been shown, and all holy obedience consists in this. It is love
   expressed and acted out in all proper ways.

   This leads to observe farther, that this love, which is the new
   creation, or the new creature, has not only the supreme Being for its
   object; but creatures also, who are capable of happiness. It wishes
   well to every such creature, so far as their good and happiness is
   consistent with the greatest public, general good, and no farther; for
   universal benevolence seeks the greatest good of the whole; and
   therefore is ready to give up, not to desire, but to renounce the good
   and happiness of individuals, when, and as far as it is inconsistent
   with the greatest good of the whole, all beings and all things taken
   into view. And as the good man is not capable of determining with any
   certainty that it is inconsistent with the greatest good of the whole
   that any who are on the stage of life with him should be happy, his
   benevolence will extend to all, and will wish them well, and pray for
   all men, even his enemies, if he have any. But his benevolence will be
   more particularly, and in a stronger degree exercised towards those who
   are most in his view, with whom he is most acquainted, whose wants,
   dangers and miseries, and whose capacity of happiness are most in his
   sight; and those who are more especially under his care, and to whom he
   is under advantage, and has more opportunity to do good. And he will
   feel himself united, in a peculiar degree, and with a more fervent
   love, to those who appear to him to be benevolent and engaged in
   desiring and promoting the greatest general good, in the exercise of
   true love to God and man. As such who are friends to God and his
   kingdom, to Jesus Christ, and the greatest public good, appear to the
   benevolent to have more real existence than others, and to be of much
   more importance in the scale of being, and are objects of the peculiar
   benevolence of the Deity; they are in this view peculiarly dear to
   them, and excellent in their eyes; and they embrace them with a
   distinguishing, strong and sweet, benevolent and complacential love.

   Having given a more general view of conversion, which is the effect of
   the regenerating influences of the Holy Spirit, and which consists in
   the volitions and actions of the regenerate, it is of importance that
   what has been mentioned, should be more particularly explained; which
   will be attempted in the following sections.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [507] The total depravity of man, and the infinite odiousness and
   criminality of all sin, are so implied in all the leading truths in the
   Bible, that a thorough conversion, and a cordial acknowledgment of
   them, in the light of the divine character and law, is essential to
   belief and hearty reception of the most important doctrines of the
   gospel. And it will doubtless be found, on proper examination, that all
   the gross errors respecting the gospel, which are, or have been
   embraced, and propagated, have originated from ignorance of the law of
   God, and the nature and ill desert of sin, and an express or implicit
   denial of these.

Section IV.

   On Disinterested Affection.

   IT has been already shown that moral depravity, or sin, consists in
   self love; and that holiness consists in disinterested benevolence,
   which is, in the nature of it, and in all its exercises, wholly
   contrary and opposed to self love. [See Part I. Chap. VIII. page 277,
   &c. to which the reader is referred.] But as this is a subject so very
   important, and necessary to be well understood, in order properly to
   distinguish true religion, and real conversion, from that which is not
   so, but false religion, and mere delusion, it is thought proper to
   bring it again into view here, in order farther to explain and confirm
   this truth, which is overlooked by too many, and opposed by others.

   Not a few have believed and asserted, that there is no such thing in
   nature as disinterested affections; and that all the actions of men
   flow from self love, as their foundation and source. Others allow that
   disinterested affection may take place in the human heart; but that it
   either springs from self love, and is grafted upon it; or so coincides
   with it, and regulates it, that both these sorts of affection, if they
   do really differ in their nature, are included in the exercises of true
   holiness; and that self love is the real foundation of all true
   religion.

   These sentiments and pleas in favour of self love, it is believed, are
   owing, in many instances, to wrong or confused ideas, and not properly
   distinguishing between self love, and that which is of a different
   nature and kind.

   First. Many do not appear to distinguish between self love, and a
   desire or love of happiness; or a capacity of pleasure and enjoyment,
   and of being pleased with and choosing one object, rather than another.
   These are quite distinct and different things: The latter is really
   nothing but a capacity or power of will and choice, for without this
   there could be no such thing as preferring one object to another, or
   exercise of choice. This therefore is essential to the existence of a
   moral agent, or to any act of will whatever, and is neither self love,
   nor disinterested affection, but necessary to both. Self love consists
   in a moral agent's placing his happiness in what he views as his own
   private personal interest, and in nothing else, in distinction from the
   interest or happiness of any other being, and in contradiction to it.
   This only pleases him, for its own sake, and is the ultimated object of
   all his desires and exertions.

   Disinterested benevolence is pleased with the public interest, the
   greatest good and happiness of the whole. This is the highest good to
   the benevolent person. In this he places his happiness, and not in the
   interest and happiness of any individual, or of himself, any farther
   than it is consistent with the greatest interest and happiness of the
   whole, and really included in it, and serves to promote it. in this
   state of the case, is it not easy to see the distinction between a
   capacity of pleasure and choice, or being pleased, and enjoying
   happiness; and placing our happiness in our own personal good and
   interest only; or in the public good for its own sake? And who docs not
   see the difference and opposition between the two latter?

   Secondly. By many there is not a proper distinction made, and kept in
   view, between self-love, and that regard which the benevolent person
   must have for himself and his interest and happiness, which is
   necessarily included in disinterested affection. Disinterested,
   impartial benevolence, to being in general that is capable of good and
   happiness, regards and wishes well to every being and creature in the
   system, according to the degree of his existence, worth and capacity of
   happiness, so far as all this comes into the view of the benevolent
   person, and so far as the good and happiness of each is, or appears to
   be, consistent with the greatest good of the whole. And as he himself
   is one individual part of the whole, he must of necessity be the object
   of this disinterested, impartial benevolence, and his own interest and
   happiness must be regarded and desired, as much as that of his
   neighbour, or any individual of the whole society; not because it is
   himself, but because he is included in the whole, and his happiness is
   worth as much, and as desirable as that of his neighbour, other
   circumstances being equal. This is not self love; but the same
   universal, disinterested, impartial, public benevolence, which wishes
   well to being in general, and therefore to himself, because he has an
   existence, and is one among the rest, and equal to his neighbour. This
   is loving his neighbour as himself; not with the least degree of self
   love; but with the same disinterested, public affection, with which he
   loves being in general. The least spark of self love will interrupt
   this reasonable and beautiful moral order and harmony, and render him
   partial and interested in his affection, and so far detach him from the
   whole and make him set up a selfish, private interest of his own, in
   distinction from that of the rest, and in opposition to it.

   By not making this distinction, and not attending to the nature of
   disinterested benevolence, as it regards the interest of the benevolent
   person himself; and therefore taking it for granted, that all the
   regard a person has for himself and desire of his own happiness is self
   love, in distinction from disinterested benevolence, they have
   concluded with great assurance, that self love is essential to man, and
   even his duty. But when the distinction is properly made, and the
   matter plainly stated, the mistake is discovered, and it appears that
   disinterested benevolence will take all proper and sufficient care of
   every individual in the system, and will desire and seek the best
   interest and happiness of all, and of the benevolent person himself, so
   far as is consistent with the greatest good of the whole: And that this
   is not self love, but the same disinterested, impartial benevolence,
   when it takes into view his own happiness, and values and seeks it as
   much as that of his neighbour. The self love which can be distinguished
   from this universal, disinterested benevolence, and is not of this
   kind, cannot be distinguished from selfishness; but is the very same
   affection, and is directly and wholly opposed to disinterested, holy
   love: And is, as has been observed, the root and essence of all sin.

   To distinguish between self love and selfishness is to attempt to make
   a distinction where there is no difference; unless by self love be
   meant disinterested benevolence. Disinterested affection and self love
   are very distinct and opposite affections, and the latter, in every
   degree of it, cannot be distinguished from selfishness: For these are
   two words, for one and the same thing. Some would distinguish between
   inordinate and well regulated self love; and suppose the former is
   selfishness and sinful; but the latter innocent, and even good and
   virtuous. But unless by well regulated self love be meant disinterested
   affection, the distinction is groundless and vain. And to suppose a
   certain degree of self love, subordinated to a contrary affection, love
   to God, and to our neighbour, is virtuous, or even innocent; and that
   the same self love in a higher degree of it, and not subordinated by a
   different and contrary affection, is sinful, is very unreasonable and
   absurd, and a supposition which is utterly impossible. For if holiness
   and sin do not consist in the nature of moral affection and exercise,
   there can be no such thing as either sin or holiness. And to suppose
   these opposites to consist in the degree of the same affection
   exercised, and not in different kinds of affection, is really to make
   them not opposites, or not to differ in nature and kind; but to be one
   and the same thing, under different modifications. For the nature and
   kind of moral exercise and affection is not changed by their being more
   or less of it, or by being under restraints or not. If the lowest
   degree of such affection be innocent and good, the highest possible
   degree of it must be so much better, and have a proportionably greater
   degree of moral goodness. And if the highest possible degree of such
   affection be sinful and wrong, the least possible degree of the same
   kind of affection must in the nature of it be sinful, though less in
   degree. If ten or a hundred degrees of self love be enmity against God,
   and contrary to uprightness and disinterested benevolence to men, and a
   disposition of mind to injure them; then one degree of this same self
   love is enmity against God, and opposite to benevolence to men in its
   nature, and in proportion to the degree of it. And though it may be
   under restraints, and counteracted by opposite affection, it is yet of
   the same nature, and the same kind of affection, and as really opposes
   the general good, which disinterested benevolence seeks, as that same
   self love, when it is under no restraint, and reigns as the only moral
   affection of the heart.

   Therefore in the scriptures we find no such distinction between self
   love and selfishness; or between well regulated self love, and that
   which is inordinate, or between a less and greater degree of this same
   affection, representing one as innocent and good, and the other sinful:
   But self love is condemned in every degree of it, in all its exercises
   and fruits. No worse character is given of men than this, that they are
   lovers of their own selves. And men are commanded not to seek their own
   wealth, and mind their own things, in distinction from those of others,
   and of Jesus Christ, and condemned for doing it. And that love, which
   seeketh not her own, is recommended as that only in which true religion
   or real holiness does consist: And surely there can be no self love in
   that love which seeketh not her own.

   This leads to what is chiefly designed in this section, viz. to prove
   from scripture that disinterested affection, or benevolence to being in
   general, and all the affection which this implies, as it has been now
   explained, is that in which true religion, or the new creature does
   summarily consist.

   1. It has been observed and shewn in the chapter to which reference is
   made in the beginning of this section, that this may be proved from
   what is said by the apostle John. [509] He says "God is love;" in which
   he evidently designs to comprehend his whole moral character. He
   mentions the highest exercise, and greatest manifestation of this love.
   This, he says, is in giving the Son of God to die for the redemption of
   sinners. This, all will grant, is, in the highest sense and degree,
   disinterested benevolence, as it is exercised towards those who are not
   only unworthy and ill deserving, but unreasonable and abusive enemies.
   This disinterested benevolence he urges christians to imitate; and
   represents it as that in which Christianity summarily consists; for he
   says, he that loveth is born of God, and this love being perfect,
   casteth out fear; and he who exercises this disinterested benevolence,
   (for he is speaking of no other love but this) he who dwelleth in this
   love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. That is, the moral image and
   character of God is formed in him, he partakes of the divine nature,
   and he is united to God, and God to him. This leads to observe, that as
   the new creature is a conformity to the moral character and image of
   God, by which Christ is said to dwell in believers; it must consist in
   disinterested benevolent affection; for in this only can christians be
   like God.

   2. Jesus Christ is a remarkable and striking instance of disinterested
   benevolence, in which christians are to imitate him; and do so, as far
   as they are christians.

   The love which he exercised, in taking man's place, and dying for him,
   is in the highest sense disinterested, as he suffered this for men,
   when they were his enemies. "God commandeth his love toward us, in that
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." His love to the Father,
   and to sinners, expressed in what he did and suffered, is represented
   as wholly disinterested, to set forth the nature and excellency of it,
   and recommend it as a pattern to be followed by his disciples. "We then
   that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to
   please ourselves: For even Christ pleased not himself; but as it is
   written, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me."
   [510] By his not pleasing himself, is meant his not seeking himself, or
   acting from self love: The same that is intended by his not seeking and
   doing his own will, but the will of his Father; and saying, "Not my
   will, but thine be done." [511] That he did not please himself, but
   acted from a disinterested regard to the glory of God, is proved by the
   quotation the apostle here makes, "The reproaches of them that
   reproached thee, fell on me." He had such a disinterested regard to the
   honour of God, that if he were reproached, It was the same to him, as
   if he himself were reproached. This St. Paul mentions as an example for
   christians, which they are to imitate by feeling for their brethren in
   all the unhappiness that attends them, so as to bear their infirmities
   and burdens.

   Again, in order to excite the Corinthians to show the sincerity, or
   genuineness of their love to the saints, that is, their disinterested
   benevolence, he mentions to them the example of Christ, and his love.
   "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
   rich, yet for your sakes, he became poor, that you, through his
   poverty, might be rich." [512] He recommends the example of Christ, in
   this same view of it, to the Philippians. [513]

   There are indeed, but few, if any christians, who do not consider the
   Saviour as acting a most disinterested part, in doing and suffering
   what he did for the salvation of sinners, as he could not have
   undertaken, and gone through it, from any other principle but
   disinterested benevolence: And this is considered as the highest
   excellency and perfection of his love. If any of those admit at the
   same time, that the love of christians, in whom is the same spirit that
   was in Christ, is not disinterested, they must be very inconsistent
   with themselves, as well as with the scripture.

   3. That disinterested affection is essential to a disciple of Christ
   appears from the words of our Saviour, recorded by Matthew. [514] He
   there tells his disciples, that loving their relations, and those who
   loved them, did not difference them from other men, even the worst of
   them; because self love would do this. That therefore they could not be
   the children of God, or have the least degree of likeness to his moral
   character, unless they had, and exercised that disinterested
   benevolence, which would extend to their enemies, even the worst of
   them, and whatever injuries they had done to them; which would wish
   them well, and pray for them, while they were doing them all the harm
   they could do. That by this alone, they would be like their Father in
   heaven; and by being perfect in this, they would be perfect, even as he
   is perfect. The love here recommended, as so essential to a christian,
   and by which alone he is distinguished from other men, is
   disinterested, universal benevolence, as opposed to self love; for no
   other affection is opposed to self love, or will love our enemies, with
   cordial friendly desires of their good and happiness, leading us to do
   them all the good we can.

   4. Our Saviour has enjoined disinterested affection, as that by which
   alone, men can follow him, and be his disciples, in the following
   words, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
   up his cross, and follow me." [515] It will be difficult for any one to
   tell how a man can deny himself, in the exercise of self love; for this
   is in every degree of it self gratification. Therefore to deny
   ourselves, is to remove all self love, and to exercise that
   disinterested, universal love to being in general, which opposes self
   love, and renounces all selfish, private interest, and knows no self,
   as such; it being an impartial affection, it respects him who exercises
   it only as belonging to being in general, and included in universal
   existence. As the excellency of Christ consists in this disinterested
   love, no one will come to him, and cordially follow him, unless it be
   in the exercise of this same disinterested affection; for without this,
   none can approve of his character, which self love opposes.

   5. St. Paul decides this matter in the most express terms, and asserts
   that all the exercises of true religion consist in disinterested
   affection, in that love which seeketh not her own. [516] He represents
   love as containing the whole of christian affection, without which
   there is nothing of any moral worth, or of real Christianity. And in
   describing this love, he says, "It seeketh not her own." Q.D. It is not
   self love which seeketh her own, and nothing else; but is directly
   opposed to this, and consists in that affection which is perfectly
   disinterested, which is universal benevolence to being in general, and
   has not the least partiality in favour of self. This is the wisdom that
   is from above, which is "Pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated,
   full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and hypocrisy." [517]

   6. That all true religion, or holy exercises of heart, consist in
   disinterested affection, is evident to a certainty, from the summary of
   the law of God, given by Christ himself, in the following words. "Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the
   second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On
   these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." [518]

   The law of God is a transcript of his moral perfection; for by the
   creature's obeying it, he partakes of the divine nature, and puts on
   the moral image of God. But the moral character of God consists in
   disinterested love, as has been shown; therefore the love required in
   the law of God, is disinterested affection: It is not self love, but
   that which is entirely contrary to selfishness. He who loves God with
   all his heart, strength and mind, can have no self love, nor any love
   to himself, or any creature, but that which is implied in this, which
   certainly must be disinterested, as his love to God is. For
   disinterested love to God cannot imply interested and selfish affection
   to any other being, even our own, but necessarily excludes it. And it
   has been shown that the command to love our neighbour as ourselves, is
   so far from approving, or supposing self love, that it necessarily
   excludes every thing of this kind; as it requires that impartiality,
   and uprightness, which is contrary to every degree of self love, and
   can exist in nothing but disinterested affection. Men are no farther
   converted, than they are conformed in the exercise and affection of
   their hearts to the law of God, which requires disinterested love, and
   nothing else, and excludes and forbids ail selfishness, or self love,
   which is the same. Therefore the new heart, and all truly christian
   exercises, consist in disinterested affection.

   Before this subject of disinterested affection is dismissed, to prevent
   mistakes, and that the nature of it may be farther explained, the
   following particulars are to be observed and kept in view.

   1. This disinterested benevolence regards the interest and happiness of
   those who are nearest and most in sight, more strongly and tenderly,
   than of those who are farther off, and more out of sight; and is more
   affected with the happiness or misery, and the good or bad character of
   the former, than of the latter.

   The mind of man is not omniscient, and cannot have a full,
   comprehensive view of all men, and their circumstances at the same
   time; therefore those who are nearest to him, and most in his sight,
   must be more the objects of his benevolence, than others: And it is
   reasonable, and therefore his duty to regard these more than others, as
   they are more in his view, and he has a special care of them, and is
   under greater advantage to think of them, and do them good. And
   impartial, disinterested affection, will naturally, and even
   necessarily, operate thus.

   He who has universal benevolence will have a greater regard for the
   inhabitants of the nation to which he belongs, and be more concerned
   for their interest, than for those of other nations. He will have a
   greater regard still for the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood
   in which he lives, other things being equal. Consequently his
   benevolent care of the members of the family to which be belongs, will
   be exercised in a higher degree, and more constantly, and with greater
   sensibility, than towards those of other families; especially if he be
   the head of it. And as every person is nearest to himself, and is most
   in his own view, has opportunity to be better acquainted with his own
   circumstances, and to know his own wants, his mercies and enjoyments,
   &:c. and has a more particular care of his own interest, than of that
   of others; and is under greater advantage to promote his own happiness,
   than others; his disinterested, universal benevolence, will attend more
   to his own interest, and he will have more and stronger exercises of
   it, respecting his own circumstances and happiness, than those of
   others, all other things being equal; not because it is his own
   interest, but for the reason just given. And were the case reversed,
   and the circumstances, wants and interests of others, were more in his
   view, and more under his care, than his own, he would pay more regard
   to them, and have greater concern for them, and their interest and
   happiness, than for his own, all other circumstances being alike.

   It hence appears that universal benevolence to being in general, not
   only includes a regard for the interest of every individual, and
   therefore an equal regard for our own interest; but a special and
   peculiar regard for the latter, and for that of the family,
   neighbourhood and town, and all those with whom we have any special
   connection. And this regard for ourselves, our own interest and
   happiness, which is necessarily included in universal benevolence, is
   not only a proper and reasonable regard, but is discerning, wise and
   judicious, and seeks our true interest. Whereas self love is partial
   and unreasonable in its own nature, and in every degree of it; and
   blinds men to their own true interest and happiness, and seeks
   happiness where it is not to be found; and as certainly and effectually
   renders them miserable, as if it were ill will to themselves.

   2. As the great object of disinterested affection, or benevolence to
   being in general, is the greatest good of the whole, and it devotes all
   to this, it will give up any less good for the greater good, and the
   interest of individuals, for the sake of the greater public interest,
   and greatest good of the whole, when, and so far as the former is
   inconsistent with the latter. And the benevolent person is disposed and
   willing to give up and relinquish his own interest and happiness, when
   inconsistent with the public good, or the greatest good of the whole;
   or when this may be necessary to promote a greater good, or more
   happiness, on the whole, than that of which he deprives himself. Yea,
   he will be willing to suffer positive evil, to save others, or the
   public from greater evil, or when necessary to promote and procure a
   greater and overbalancing good, on the whole. This is the nature of
   disinterested affection, and essential to it, which appears from what
   has been said of it above. In this the opposition and contrariety
   between holy love, and self love appears. He who has the former
   devotes, all to the greatest good of the whole; and gives up the
   interest of individuals, and his own interest, when necessary, to
   promote the good of the whole; and desires not his own happiness, or
   that of any other particular person, if inconsistent with a greater
   good to others, or with the greatest public good: And is willing to
   suffer, and that other particular persons should suffer, any deserved
   evil, which is necessary to prevent a greater public evil; or to
   promote the greater good of others, and of the whole. On the contrary,
   he who is under the government of self love, and so far as he is
   influenced by this, seeks, and is wholly devoted to his own personal,
   private interest, as the supreme good, placing all good and happiness
   in this; and therefore will not give up and relinquish his own supposed
   interest, or any part or degree of it, for the sake of the interest and
   happiness of any other being in the universe; their good and interest
   being nothing to him, no object of his desires and wishes, any farther
   than he thinks his own selfish good is connected with theirs, and
   promoted by it. Consequently, he, in the feelings and exercises of his
   heart, subordinates the whole interest of the universe, and of every
   other being, to his own little, personal, selfish interest, and wishes
   no good to any one, or to the whole any farther than it may promote his
   own selfish ends, and turn to his own advantage. And were sell love
   under no restraints, but were acted out fully agreeable to the nature
   of it, it would give up and destroy all the good and happiness of the
   universe, and of ever) other being but the selfish person, and bring
   universal evil and misery on all, were this possible, in order to gain
   die least supposed advantage to himself. This is the true character of
   them who are, "lovers of their own selves."

   This view of disinterested affection will give in some measure, the
   distinguishing character and properties of the new creature. It
   consists in the love of benevolence, which implies all that
   disinterested affection, m the exercise of which the true convert loves
   God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself. It implies
   repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, joy in God, in the Redeemer,
   humility, resignation to the divine will: A cheerful and pleasing
   dedication of himself, and of every thing with which he has any
   concern, to Christ, his interest and honour, and to be disposed of and
   used by him, in the way which he sees best, to answer his own
   infinitely wise designs; which shall in the highest degree possible
   promote the divine glory, and the greatest happiness of his kingdom. It
   is true wisdom, which discerns and pursues the only objects worthy to
   be desired and sought. It is goodness and truth, putting on bowels of
   mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, temperance and
   sobriety. It is heavenly minded, setting the affection on things above,
   not on things on the earth, &c. &c.

IMPROVEMENT.

   1. From this scriptural and rational view of disinterested affection,
   in which all true virtue, piety and charity consist, may be seen what a
   great and dangerous mistake they have made, who suppose that there is
   no virtue or true religion, but that which consists in self love, or
   originates from it; and that no man ever acts or can act from any
   higher or other principle, whatever he may think or pretend. Surely
   these "call evil good, and good evil; put darkness for light, and light
   for darkness; bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter." [519] They call
   that virtue and goodness, which is directly opposed to all true virtue
   and goodness; and in which all moral evil consists. They call the only
   moral good, evil. They say there is no such thing as disinterested
   affection, and if there were, it must be evil. And all appearance of
   it, or pretension to it, is nothing but hypocrisy or delusion. They put
   that for light and wisdom, which is darkness itself, in which all moral
   darkness consists. They recommend and delight in that, as the source of
   all happiness, which is the most odious thing in nature, and is the
   source of all the mischief and misery among creatures.

   It is true, that mankind in general appear to act from no higher or
   better principle than self love. But this affords not the least
   evidence that man is not capable of disinterested affection, or that
   self love is not the essence and substance of all sin. It is indeed an
   evidence that the account the scripture gives of man is true, that he
   is naturally totally depraved, and wholly corrupt: And that he must be
   renewed by the Spirit of God, in order to his becoming in the least
   degree virtuous and holy.

   II. We hence learn how false and pernicious that doctrine is, which too
   many have held and asserted, viz. that true love to God originates from
   a knowledge or belief that he loves us, and designs to make us happy:
   Or that a man cannot love God, unless he first has evidence that God
   loves him with a design to save him. This is excluding disinterested
   affection entirely, and making all religious affection to consist in
   self love; for that love to any being which is wholly owing to a
   knowledge or belief that he loves us, is nothing but self love. Our
   Saviour therefore condemns this, as not true christian love; but a love
   which may be found in the most selfish, wicked man. He says, "If ye
   love them which love you, what thanks have ye? For sinners also love
   those that love them." [520] There is no need that a man should be
   regenerated and born of the Spirit of God, in order to his loving God,
   so far as he is persuaded that God loves him, with a design to save him
   from eternal destruction, and make him happy forever. This is
   consistent with being a real enemy to the divine character: And the
   greatest enemy to God will do this, without any change of heart for the
   better. And if any person has no other love to God but this, it is
   certain he has not a new heart, is not converted, and has not the
   Spirit of God; but all his religious affection and devotion is nothing
   but wickedness, and enmity against God and his law.

   He who has a new heart, and universal disinterested benevolence, will
   be a friend to God, and must be pleased with his infinitely benevolent
   character, though he see not the least evidence, and has not a thought
   that God loves him, and designs to save him. And if he could know that
   God designed, for his own glory and the general good, to cast him into
   endless destruction; this would not make him cease to approve of his
   character; he would continue to be a friend of God, and to be pleased
   with his moral perfection. And he would, even on this supposition, and
   in this case, exercise true gratitude to God for all the good he had
   received or did now enjoy, and for his great and wonderful love to the
   world, in providing salvation for man. For benevolence exercised and
   manifested in doing good is the object of gratitude, and will excite it
   in him who has disinterested benevolent affection, though he receives
   no personal benefit by it.

   Therefore they who cannot love God, unless he first manifest to them
   that he is their friend, and designs to save them, are the
   unregenerate, who have no disinterested affection; but are wholly
   selfish in all their religious exercises and affections; and their
   religion, whatever appearance it may put on, is false and destructive.

   But if such love to God as this were true love, and real piety, it is
   impossible it should ever take place. For God has not discovered, and
   never will discover to any man, that he loves him, and will save him,
   who has no love to God: It is impossible therefore that he who does not
   now love God should have any real good evidence from any quarter that
   God loves him, or that he shall be saved. He must first love God in
   order to have any evidence that God will not destroy him forever. He
   therefore who cannot love God until he has evidence, and God discovers
   to him that he shall be saved, never can be brought to love him;
   because this discovery never w ill be made to him, so long as he does
   not love God; and if he thinks he has had such a disco very, it is mere
   delusion, and he is made to believe a lie: Consequently all his love to
   God is built on a falsehood and delusion. So that they who can have no
   love to God, unless he first discovers to them that he intends to save
   them, and think they have had such a discovery, and from this they
   began, and continue to love him, are deluded two ways, and in two
   respects. Their supposed discovery that God loves them, and will save
   them, and their belief of this, is altogether a delusion, and they only
   believe a lie. But if this were a true and real discovery, and this
   were possible, yet their love and religious affection which is wholly
   founded on this discovery, and they love God only because he loves
   them, and for no other reason, has no moral goodness in it; it is
   nothing but self love, and therefore nothing but sin: And such cannot
   be saved, or enjoy God, nor can God love them unless they have new
   hearts given them, by which this same self love will be destroyed, in a
   degree at least, and disinterested affection takes place, which will be
   friendly to God, and love him, whether he be friendly to them, or not.

   An expression of St. John has been often produced to confront what has
   been now advanced; and to prove that the only ground and reason of
   christians loving God, is a belief of his love to them. This is in the
   following words, "We love him because he first loved us." [521] It is
   of importance carefully to consider what is the real meaning of these
   words of inspiration, lest by inattention or prejudice we should put a
   wrong sense upon them, and overlook the truth which is designed to be
   communicated by them. It has been observed, that in this context the
   apostle is considering and recommending the love of God in giving his
   Son to die for the redemption of sinners, and urging christians to
   imitate this love, which is certainly disinterested love; love to men
   while they hated God, and not love to them because they loved him.
   Christians therefore could not imitate the love of God here
   recommended, by loving him purely because he loved them; for this would
   be so far from imitating the love of God, that it would be only an
   exercise of self love, which is in nature and kind directly opposed to
   the disinterested love of God. Therefore the apostle cannot here mean
   to recommend self love, or interested affection; and assert that the
   only ground and reason of their love to God, was the manifestation and
   evidence given to them that God loved them; and that they had good
   evidence that God loved them, and designed to save them, before they
   began to love him, and as necessary in order to their loving him: Not
   only because this would be inconsistent with the whole context, and
   make all his reasoning contradictory, futile and absurd; but to suppose
   this, is to make him assert that which is utterly impossible, as has
   been just now observed. Besides, by putting this sense upon these
   words, they are made inconsistent with the other parts of the Bible,
   which represent the holy love of christians to consist in disinterested
   affection, in opposition to self love; which, it is presumed, has been
   made evident in this section. Moreover, by understanding these words in
   this sense, they stand in direct contradiction to the assertion of our
   Saviour, viz. That to love those who love us, and that purely because
   they love us, is not a virtuous, holy love, but that which the worst of
   men may have. "For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye?
   For sinners also love those that love them." [522] It is therefore
   certain, that those words of the Apostle cannot be understood in this
   sense, without making him contradict himself, and to assert that which
   is inconsistent with all the rest of the Bible, and with the plainest
   dictates of reason and common sense.

   And if another meaning offers itself, which is consistent with all
   those, and which the context points out, and which is a natural and
   easy sense, who will hesitate to embrace it? The Apostle is in this
   passage celebrating the love of God in giving his Son to be a
   propitiation for the sins of men, as the pattern of all holy love. He
   says, "Herein is love: Not that we loved God; but that he loved us, and
   sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins." He refers to the love
   of God as the original ground and cause of all the good which came to
   them; he loved them first, while men were sinners and had no love to
   him, but were his enemies. His love laid the foundation of all good,
   moral and natural, in man. Therefore, "We love him because he first
   loved us." That is, had he not been first in his love, before we loved
   him, and opened a way for our reconciliation, by sending his Son to be
   a propitiation for our sins, and by his Spirit regenerated us unto holy
   disinterested love, to which the unrenewed heart is an utter stranger:
   Had he not thus first loved us and done all this for us, we should
   never have known what true disinterested love is. Therefore we are
   certain that the cause of our loving God is his love to us, which has
   opened the way for it, and actually wrought it in us. "We love him,
   because he loved us," and gave us the spirit of love in our
   regeneration; for none but those who are born of God do love him. Thus
   it appears that these words perfectly coincide with the whole context,
   when understood in the sense now put upon them; and are very far from
   asserting that we cannot love God, unless we have evidence or believe
   that he loves us, and designs to save us; or that a christian's love to
   God originates wholly from a belief that God loves him. It does
   originate from the love of God to him, in the sense now given: It is
   wholly owing to the love and kindness of God, in giving his Son to die
   for him; and then saving him by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost. So that it is not of him that willeth, nor
   of him that runneth, but of God who sheweth mercy. Had not God first
   loved him, and done all this for him, he never would have had any true
   love to God.

   III. From this subject may be inferred the propriety and importance of
   public teachers constantly and with clearness distinguishing between
   self love, and disinterested affection, and showing that true religion,
   and all holy exercise consists in the latter, and not at all in the
   former. If this be not done, and a clear distinction between these two
   opposites be not constantly made and kept up, true religion cannot be
   set in a proper light, and distinguished from all counterfeits, and
   they may leave their hearers in ignorance, and lead them into
   deception, in this important matter, and to rest in a religion that is
   nothing more than mere selfishness, and opposition to true holiness. If
   that religion be not taught and inculcated which is opposed to self
   love: but on the contrary, selfish affections are recommended as true
   holiness, the blind lead the blind, and they both are like to fall into
   the ditch. Mankind, when they turn their thoughts to religion, being
   naturally wholly selfish, are strongly inclined to approve and take up
   with a selfish religion; as this only is agreeable to their hearts.
   They are therefore disposed to like that preaching best which gratifies
   and flatters their self love and pride. And if they are taught that
   they may be converted and be good christians, without denying
   themselves and crossing their self love; but in the full gratification
   of this; and disinterested affection, or that wherein it consists, be
   spoken of with disapprobation, and condemned as wrong or impossible, or
   is kept wholly out of sight: This tends to confirm them in a delusion,
   which doubtless proves fatal to thousands. The more men are inclined to
   embrace and be satisfied with a selfish religion, the more careful and
   zealous should public teachers be, to oppose it, and detect the
   delusion, and preach up that pure and undefiled religion, which
   consists in renouncing self, and in the exercise of disinterested
   affection. This would be striking at the root of self love, pride and
   human depravity, and setting holiness in a true and beautiful light.
   And though such preaching, when it is understood, may not please, but
   offend those who have nothing but self love; yet it ought to be
   inculcated, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

   And it is of importance to keep it in view, that universal benevolence,
   and impartial disinterested goodness is the sum and source of all holy
   affection, as it is all implied and contained in this, by whatever
   different names it may be called, as has been shown. It tends to
   confuse and mislead the mind on this subject of love, if when love to
   God is spoken of and described, it is represented as consisting wholly
   in the love of complacency, and benevolent affection is implicitly
   excluded: Whereas this is the essence of the whole; and the love of
   complacency and of gratitude ought to be considered as the exercise of
   universal, disinterested benevolence, in order to set the subject in
   the clearest light, and to prevent mistakes. Too many who hold the
   truth on this point in theory, or will assent to it, at least, when it
   is proposed and explained to them, yet, when they treat on love to God,
   do either by the influence of habit and custom, or through inattention,
   leave out all idea of benevolence, as if the love of complacency and
   gratitude were distinct and stood alone, independent of universal
   benevolence. And this is too often the case, when love to our neighbour
   is mentioned. Disinterested benevolence, which is the sum, and
   comprehends all, is overlooked, as if no such affection existed. This
   is a misrepresentation of love, and has an evil tendency.

   IV. This subject exhibits a rule by which all who suppose themselves to
   be converted, and real christians, may try their conversion, and
   religious exercises and conduct, in order to determine of what kind
   their religion is, whether true or false.

   Many have asserted, as has been observed above, that it is impossible
   to love God unless we first believe that he designs to save us; and
   that such belief is the necessary foundation of all friendly affection
   to him. If their hearts agree with their theory, and all their love to
   God originates from a persuasion that he loves them, it is certain,
   that all their supposed piety is mere delusion; and that they are not
   friends, but enemies to the true God; which has been shown above.

   There have been, and now are many, who, when they have given a relation
   of their conversion, have represented that they were first brought to
   love God, from a persuasion that he first loved them, and designed to
   save them, that Christ died for them, &c. And that all their after
   religious exercises and love are founded on this persuasion, and sink
   or rise, as that is stronger or weaker. If this account which they give
   of themselves, of their conversion and religious exercises, be in fact
   true, all their religion, from beginning to end, falls short of real
   Christianity; and is of a contrary nature. It was impossible they could
   have such a persuasion on good ground antecedent to their loving God;
   therefore they believed without any evidence, and all their religion
   was founded on delusion and falsehood. But if it were miraculously
   revealed to them, that God designed to save them, and all their love to
   him originated from such a revelation, and they could not love him, on
   any other supposition, all their religious exercise has its foundation
   in selfishness, and is nothing but self love, and consistent with
   enmity against God.

   Others give a different account of their first conversion and after
   religious exercise, which may consist in disinterested affection, and
   has that appearance; yet ought to be carefully considered and examined,
   lest some fatal deception should lurk at bottom. They may reasonably
   inquire, whether old things are passed away, and all things are become
   new, in this respect; that whereas they were naturally wholly selfish
   in their views, exercises and desires, they now have disinterested
   affection, and new views and desires, which appear to be of this kind.
   Whether they have that benevolent regard to God and the Redeemer, as to
   lead them to desire, above all things, that he may be glorified, and
   his will be done, whatever it may be; that his interest and kingdom may
   be promoted, and come to perfection, so as to comprise the greatest
   possible happiness and glory of the universe: And whether they thus
   "seek first the kingdom of God," and devote all they have, and
   themselves, to his glory, and the greatest good of the whole; having no
   other interest but this, and what is comprehended in it; not desiring
   their own happiness, or that of any other individual, unless it be
   consistent with the glory of God, and the greatest general good: And
   whether they are sincerely desiring and seeking the good of all men now
   living, and wishing every one to be happy, so far as may be consistent
   with the w ill of God, and the greatest general good; and actually
   endeavouring to do good to all men, as they have opportunity; and
   careful not to injure their character, persons or interest, in any
   respect, by word or action; at the same time, being liberal and
   bountiful to the poor and distressed to the utmost of their ability;
   and expressing their benevolence to all, by praying for them: And
   whether they love their enemies with benevolent affection, whatever
   injuries they may have done them: and are disposed to do good to them;
   and do wish them well, and pray for them: Whether those who appear to
   them to be the benevolent friends of God and man, are peculiarly dear
   to them, to whom their hearts are united in strong benevolent
   affection, and complacential love. If they find their religious
   affection is of this nature, and implies all this, and their words and
   actions are in some good measure answerable, they may reasonably
   conclude that they are born of the Spirit of God, and that their
   religion consists in disinterested affection.

   It must be added, that this disinterested benevolence will farther
   evidence itself in religious, holy joy in God, his works and revealed
   designs, in which there is no selfishness, but the contrary. It will
   rejoice in the infinite, independent, unchangeable, and eternal
   felicity of the triune God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and that he is
   able, and will glorify himself to the highest possible degree forever.
   It rejoices in the hope and assurance of the glory of God, and that
   nothing has, or shall take place, which shall not turn to his glory:
   That the wrath of man shall praise him, and the remainder of wrath he
   will restrain. It will also rejoice, that the greatest good, and
   highest happiness of the creation, will be promoted, and take place.
   That all the evil that does, or shall exist, cannot prevent this; but
   is all ordered, and will be overruled by infinite wisdom and goodness,
   to answer this end; so as to issue in the greatest good of the whole.
   Thus the felicity and glory of God, and the greatest good and happiness
   of the creation, as one united whole, is the great object of the
   desire, hope and joy of the truly benevolent. They rejoice in the
   divine character and perfection; in the independent supremacy, and
   infinitely wise and good government of God, under which nothing can
   take place, but what is, all things considered, wisest and best, and
   necessary in the best manner to promote the greatest good of the whole.
   They acquiesce and rejoice in his infinitely wise and holy will, that
   it is done in heaven, and on earth, and will be done forever; And that
   his counsel and designs, which have fixed all events, from the greatest
   to the least, are established forever, and cannot be obstructed, or
   altered.

   In all this the benevolent christian does rejoice, independent of his
   own personal interest; and whatever may be the will of God concerning
   that, and whatever may become of him, and other individuals, whether
   his or their particular personal interest and happiness be consistent
   with the glory of God and the general good, and included in these, or
   not. Yet he who exercises this disinterested affection, views his own
   personal interest as great and important; yea, he feels it to be much
   greater and more important, than when he was wholly selfish; and has a
   proper regard for it. But as the public interest now appears to him to
   be infinitely greater, and of more worth, than the happiness of any
   individual, he is disposed to give up and renounce all the latter, so
   far as it is inconsistent with the public interest, and as is necessary
   to promote the greatest common good. And that self love which is
   contrary to this, is enmity to the greatest good of the public, and to
   the good of society; and therefore enmity against God.

   The true christian, who, so far as he is such, exercises this
   disinterested affection, may consider all this, and examine himself by
   it; and yet be left in doubt, whether he has any degree of such
   affection, or not; and sometimes may even conclude against himself,
   that he is an utter stranger to it. This may, in some instances, be
   owing to not attending to, and understanding the distinction and
   difference between a proper and great regard to their own interest,
   which is included in disinterested affection, as it has been stated
   above, and that self love, which seeks a selfish interest only: And
   they are ready to look upon all regard to their personal interest and
   desire of happiness to be self love; and hence are led to doubt whether
   they have any other affection; and sometimes to conclude they are
   wholly selfish. This also may arise from a view and sense of the great
   degree and strength of self love, which yet continues with them. He who
   has any degree of disinterested affection has a proportionable greater
   discerning of the nature and exercise of selfishness, which is in his
   own heart. His disinterested love may be said to be the eye which
   discerns his self love, in all its secret workings, and the real
   odiousness of it. His attention is therefore turned to this; he looks
   upon it so much, and watches it so constantly, and sees so much of it,
   that sometimes he sees nothing else, and is ready to conclude he is
   wholly selfish in all he does; and is a stranger to disinterested
   affection. It is hoped that what has been said on this subject, in this
   section, will be some help to all honest inquirers, who have some
   degree of disinterested affection, to discern their own character, and
   to make proper distinction between the love of a true christian and
   self love; and thus obtain evidence that they are born of the Spirit of
   God. And that those who have never been renewed to holiness, but are
   wholly selfish in all their exercises, will, by attending to these
   things, if they will attend, be convinced that they are far from having
   any true religion.

   These latter are in great danger of continuing in their deception, and
   holding fast their delusion. They find religion so frequently, and so
   much represented as a selfish thing, both in public preaching, in
   books, and in conversation; and disinterested affection so much spoken
   against, as a mere chimera, and impossible; and so much said in favour
   of self love; that they may be disposed to treat what is the subject of
   this section, as erroneous and whimsical, and not worthy of their
   attention.

   And if they be convinced that true religion does consist in
   disinterested affection, as described above, they are in danger of
   considering the exercises of their self love, as being disinterested
   benevolence; since, by the supposition, they know not what the latter
   is, experimentally; and their self love, in so many ways, puts on the
   garb of disinterested benevolence, and makes a plausible appearance:
   And they are so partial in favour of themselves, and their own
   affections, that they are easily deceived into a favourable opinion of
   them. Even from self love and pride, they may exert themselves for the
   public good, either because they consider their own interest as
   connected with that of the public, and dependent upon it; or because
   this is the way to escape infamy, and get the applause of their fellow
   men. And they may be kind and generous to others, either because others
   love them, or from a selfish desire to have the name of generous,
   charitable persons. And they think they do these things from a
   disinterested regard to the public, and to others, because it has such
   an appearance. Besides, the most selfish person has some affections
   which are not self love, nor disinterested benevolence, but have some
   resemblance to the latter. What is called natural affection, the
   affection of parents to children, and of children to parents, &c. is
   not, of itself, and in the nature of it, moral affection; but what is
   called mere instinct. This is called love, by which parents and
   children are inclined to desire the welfare of each other, and looks
   like disinterested benevolence: But is really nothing but instinct,
   which falls below moral agency; accompanied and strengthened by self
   love, in selfish persons; and therefore is no evidence that they who
   have this in the highest degree, have the least degree of disinterested
   affection under consideration, or universal benevolence, which is
   essential to holy love.

   And what is called natural pity or compassion, is not self love, nor is
   it universal benevolence, but an instinct, which God, for wise reasons,
   and for the good of mankind, has implanted in all men. This being a
   sort of benevolence, is by many mistaken for disinterested holy love,
   and so are deceiving themselves and others. Would men know their own
   moral character, they must distinguish these from universal
   benevolence, and that disinterested affection, in which all true
   religion consists. [523]

   V. This subject teaches us the excellency of real Christianity; and
   that it is suited to promote the happiness of individuals who partake
   of the true spirit of it, and of society, where it prevails.

   Self love tends to natural evil, and always produces it, unless it be
   restrained and counteracted. It contracts the mind of him who is under
   the power of this selfish affection. It sinks it down to a sordid
   littleness and lowness of spirit, and prevents his proper enjoyment of
   the good and happiness of others; and subjects him to innumerable,
   painful feelings and miseries, which are the necessary attendants of
   pride, envy, covetousness, &c. And this same self love is the source of
   all the evils that take place in society. All instances of
   unrighteousness, oppression and cruelty, of contention and war, and of
   every injury done by one to another, or to the public; and all deceit,
   falsehood and hypocrisy, incontinency, and every unruly lust; and every
   thing which worketh evil to others, and to society, are the fruit of
   self love. Take this away, and all these will cease. And this is
   removed as far as the spirit of true Christianity is imbibed.

   But universal benevolence, christian love, spreads happiness, wherever
   it flourishes. It enlarges and ennobles the mind, and puts the
   benevolent person in possession of the good and happiness of others, so
   that he enjoys it all in a great degree, and rejoices with those who
   rejoice. By this he becomes a cordial and judicious friend to every
   one, and more especially to those with whom he has the most connection;
   and is disposed to do good to all, as he has ability and opportunity:
   And is devoted to the good of the public, and of the society to which
   he belongs, being ready to give up his private, personal interest, in
   any part or the whole of it, when the public interest demands it, and
   this is necessary for the good of the whole. This disinterested
   benevolence will lead every one to take his proper place, and to be
   industrious, active, prudent and faithful in his own business, and
   honest, upright, sincere and true in all his concerns and dealings with
   his fellow men. This love is kind, it is mercy, humility,
   condescension, meekness, peaceableness, temperance, long suffering, and
   brotherly kindness. This will form rules by which they may fill their
   station with honour and usefulness; to use their influence for the
   public good, and the happiness of every individual, so far as is
   consistent with the greatest public happiness. And this will induce
   those in more private stations, to acquiesce in, and support good
   government; to live in peace with all men, if possible. And this will
   unite all the particular members of the society to each other, and form
   them into a band of brothers, all engaged to promote the general good,
   and the best interest of each other, so far as it may be consistent
   with, and subserve the greatest good of the whole.

   Whenever Christianity shall spread over the whole world, and the
   distinguishing spirit and power of it take place universally, forming
   men to a high degree of universal benevolence, and disinterested
   affection, it will unite mankind into one happy society, teaching them
   to love each other as brethren, each one seeking and rejoicing in the
   public good, and in the happiness of individuals: This will form the
   most happy state of public society that can be enjoyed on earth. And
   when we take into view their love to the Redeemer, their devotedness to
   his honour and service, and obedience to his laws, in the practice of
   piety, devotion and mercy; their joy in his character, exaltation and
   honour; their gratitude to him for their redemption from infinite evil,
   and making them heirs of unspeakable felicity; their unshaken trust in
   him for the fulfilment of all his promises; and their clear and sure
   prospects of their eternal happiness, and the endless and increasing
   glory of his kingdom:--This will be the greatest likeness of heaven of
   any thing that has taken place on earth, or ever will. And they will
   hereby be made meet for the eternal inheritance of the saints in light.

   This leads to a view of the most perfect, happy, and glorious society
   in heaven, in the eternal kingdom of God. All the beauty, happiness,
   and glory of it, will consist in this disinterested love, made perfect,
   reigning, and having its proper and full effect, without impediment,
   both in God, and in every member of this kingdom.

Section V.

   Concerning Divine Illumination.

   THE divine oracles represent all the wicked, by which are meant all men
   who are not righteous, to be in a state of darkness; from which they
   only are recovered, who are born of God, and become real christians.
   "The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they
   stumble." [524] "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
   of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
   because they are spiritually discerned." [525] "Ye were once darkness,
   but now are ye light in the Lord." [526] All unbelievers, ungodly and
   disobedient, are said in scripture to be blind, and not to know God, in
   places too many to mention here. St. Paul says, "If our gospel be hid,
   it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the god of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
   them." [527] "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, in flaming
   lire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
   gospel." [528] Agreeable to this, men are said by conversion, by which
   they become true christians, to have their eyes opened, and to be
   turned from darkness to light. To be called out of darkness into
   marvellous light. To be delivered from the power of darkness, and
   translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son. [529] And conversion
   from sin to God is described by being enlightened. [530]

   This ignorance and darkness, and the contrary light or knowledge, are,
   according to scripture, of a moral nature, and consequently consist not
   in intellectual ignorance, and knowledge, as distinct from any thing
   which belongs to the heart, and not implying any sensations and
   exercises of the latter: For that darkness or light which belongs to
   the intellect, or speculative understanding, as distinct from the
   heart, and in which the heart has no influence or concern, has nothing
   moral in it, and is neither virtuous nor vicious, sin or holiness.
   Therefore the scripture constantly speaks of this darkness and light,
   this ignorance or want of understanding, and the contrary understanding
   and knowledge, as having their seat in the heart, and belonging to
   that, and predicated of it, and as being, as that is, whether right or
   wrong, wholly corrupt or renewed. The following passages are sufficient
   to prove this. "Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive,
   and eyes to see, and ears to hear unto this day." [531] When the great
   ignorance and delusion, and stupidity of idolators, in worshipping an
   image, which they have formed out of a tree, is described, it is, in
   the conclusion, all ascribed to their hearts. "They have not known, nor
   understood; for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and
   their hearts, that they cannot understand. And none considereth in his
   heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding, to say, I have
   burnt part of it in the fire, &:c. He feedeth on ashes. A deceived
   heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say,
   Is there not a He in my right hand?" [532]

   St. Paul asserts the same of the Gentiles in general. They became vain
   in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Having the
   understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through
   the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
   heart." [533] And he asserts the same of the Jews. That their
   blindness, respecting Christ and the gospel, was wholly in their
   hearts, or owing to the vail drawn over them by their opposition to
   God, and turning away from him: And that this blindness could not be
   removed, unless their hearts were renewed, and turned to the Lord.
   "Their minds were blinded.--Even unto this day, when Moses is read, the
   vail is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord,
   the vail shall be taken away." [534] The evangelist John says the same
   of the Jews, which Isaiah had long before said of them. "He hath
   blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; that they should not see
   with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and
   I should heal them." [535] So all their ignorance and errors are
   ascribed to their evil hearts in the following words, taken from the
   95th Psalm. "Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said.
   They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."
   [536] "He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
   darkness, even until now. He that hateth his brother, is in darkness,
   and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
   darkness hath blinded his eyes." [537] This darkness is here said to
   consist in the heart, in the evil disposition of that, in not loving
   but hating his brother, which is an exercise of the heart, and belongs
   to that only.

   It hence appears why this darkness is always spoken of in divine
   revelation as criminal. It is sinful in every degree of it, as it
   consists in the moral depravity of the heart. This blindness of mind is
   not only connected with sinful depravity, but consists in the sinful
   exercises and lusts of the mind, and cannot be distinguished from sin
   in the heart. Sin is in every degree and in every exercise of it,
   delusion and blindness itself: And when the heart is totally corrupt or
   sinful, which is true of every unrenewed heart, as has been proved,
   this blindness, this moral darkness, is total, and wholly excludes
   every degree of the opposite, which is called light, understanding,
   knowledge and wisdom, in the scriptures. It is, according to scripture,
   a wilful blindness, being wholly owing to the opposition of the heart
   to the light of moral truth, or rather, consisting altogether in this.
   It is represented by closing the eyes to keep light out, however
   clearly it may shine, and can be kept out by nothing but by not making
   a right use of the eyes, by refusing to open them. Men are naturally
   totally blind to the things of the moral world, except it be only in
   mere speculation, because they are totally corrupt, and wholly abuse
   and pervert the natural powers and faculties of their mind, and their
   capacity of moral exercises and true discernment, by loving darkness
   and hating the light. Consequently, this blindness is nothing but sin,
   and consists wholly in the criminal, inexcusable exercise of the will
   or heart. Hence this darkness is condemned and forbidden by God in his
   word; and they who are in this sense blind, are commanded to open their
   mental eye, to renounce the darkness and delusions in which they are,
   and receive the knowledge of the truth, in the love of it. "Hear, ye
   deaf, and look, ye blind, that ye may see." [538] "Awake, thou that
   sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
   [539] And hence Christ, when he was on earth, and since his ascension
   to heaven, did so often say, "He that hath cars to hear, let him hear.
   He that hath an ear, let him hear."

   And that the above representation of this matter is agreeable to truth
   and to scripture, is confirmed beyond all dispute, by the most plain
   and express statement of it, by our Saviour himself. His words are, "He
   that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed
   in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the
   condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
   rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that
   doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light." [540]
   Believing on Christ implies a discerning the truth respecting the
   character of the Redeemer, and redemption by him, and approving and
   loving it: and in this does faith consist. Unbelief is directly the
   opposite; it is blindness and darkness itself. St. Paul says, "If our
   gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this
   world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not." It consists in
   opposition to the most desirable, charming, glorious light and truth,
   and in hating it, and loving the opposite darkness. Therefore this is a
   voluntary, chosen darkness. It is altogether criminal, and is that for
   which they are justly condemned.

   It hence follows, that the light and understanding which is opposed to
   this moral darkness does also belong to the heart, and implies a
   virtuous character, and does consist in true holiness, or moral
   excellence. And in this light it is represented in the sacred writings.
   What Solomon asks, and God promises to give him, is called wisdom and
   knowledge, in one place, [541] and in another place, is called a wise
   and understanding heart. [542] Indeed, true wisdom has its seat in the
   heart or will, and consists essentially in the right moral disposition
   of the mind, as has been shewn: And it is abundantly evident, that the
   word is generally used in this sense in the scripture. And this in
   scripture is the same with true light, or discerning, understanding and
   knowledge. The virtuous, holy heart, is an enlightened, wise and
   understanding heart. And the totally depraved, vicious heart, is
   darkness itself, blind, foolish, and without understanding. That true
   light and knowledge, the knowledge of God, does not consist in mere
   speculation, but depends upon the heart, and consists in the moral
   disposition and exercises of that, is evident from the following words
   of God by Jeremiah: "I will give them an heart to know me." [543]
   Therefore our Saviour placed all holiness of heart, and all true
   happiness, in the knowledge of the only true God, and the Redeemer, as
   the whole is comprehended in this. "This is life eternal, that they
   might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has
   sent." [544] Agreeable to this the Psalmist says, "Give me
   understanding and I shall keep thy law: Yea, I shall observe it with my
   whole heart. Give me understanding, and I shall live." [545] That the
   illumination which takes place in the mind, in regeneration and
   conversion, respects the heart, and has its seat in that, is asserted
   by St. Paul in the following words: "God, who commanded the light to
   shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of
   the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." [546]
   And that true light and knowledge implies renovation of heart, or true
   holiness, and is really the same thing, is evident from St. Paul's
   mentioning these as synonymous. In his epistle to the Colossians, he
   describes the new man, or renewed hearty in the following words: "And
   have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image
   of him that created him." [547] And in his epistle to the Ephesians, in
   describing the same new man, he uses these words; "And be renewed in
   the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, which after God is
   created in righteousness and true holiness. " [548] From these two
   passages, compared together, it may be inferred with certainty, that
   knowledge comprehends righteousness and true holiness, and is the same
   thing.

   That true light and knowledge, the knowledge of God, which is peculiar
   to them who are renewed and born of the Spirit of God, is seated in the
   heart, and implies voluntary exercise, even that love, in which all
   holiness consists, according to scripture, may be proved from the
   following passage: "Beloved, let us love one another: For love is of
   God: and every one that loveth is horn of God, and knoweth God, He that
   loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love." [549] In these words,
   love and knowing God, are asserted to be so connected, that where love
   is, there is the knowledge of God; and they who have no love, do not
   know God. Hence it may be inferred, that the knowledge of God is
   dependent on love; for he who does not love, does not know him: There
   must therefore be this love, in order to know God, as the latter cannot
   exist without the former; and does exist wherever the former exists.
   And it is farther inferred, that love, and the knowledge of God, cannot
   be distinguished, as the one implies the other, and are the same
   exercise of the heart. Loving God is knowing him, and knowing God is
   loving him. Love is the eye of the mind, by which the objects in the
   moral world are seen in a true light; and where this eye, this
   discerning, is not, the mind is in total darkness with respect to moral
   objects. The reason of this is here given, "For God is love." As love
   comprehends all moral excellence, and in this the moral character of
   God consists; therefore he who loveth not, cannot have any true idea or
   conception of love; he cannot know the divine moral character, which is
   love. Love is here to be understood in its general nature, "Every one
   that loveth. He that loveth not." That is, he whose heart is not formed
   to the exercise of universal, disinterested benevolence. This, as has
   been shown, comprehends all virtuous, holy love; and is the same
   affection, whether it be exercised towards God or our neighbour. All
   the difference is owing to the difference of the objects of this same
   love.

   In this view it appears that the same thing is asserted by this apostle
   in the preceding part of this epistle. He says, "he that hateth his
   brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, even until now. But
   lie that loveth his brother, abideth in the light." [550] He that
   loveth is born of God, and is divinely illuminated, and knoweth God,
   and the objects of the moral world, and walketh in the light. He that
   loveth not is in total darkness with respect to these objects: he hath
   not seen God, nor known him; for the pure in heart only, that is, they
   who love, see God. [551] Love is the only light of the moral world.
   Could this be extinguished, all would be total darkness. And they who
   are fallen into the darkness of sin, or self love, in which all sin
   radically consists, as has been shown, can be recovered to light, by
   that renovation only, that purity of heart which consists in love, or
   disinterested affection. Hence it appears that when this apostle says,
   "God is light, " [552] and "God is love," [553] he does not mean any
   thing really different by light and love; for they cannot be
   distinguished; but are the same thing. Light is love, and love is
   light.

   This same sentiment, which is inculcated by the apostle John in the
   passages just considered, is also asserted by St. Paul, in the
   following words. "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. If any man
   think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
   know." That is, if any man who does not love, think he has true
   knowledge by mere speculation, and that all light and knowledge
   consists in this, and desires and seeks no other, he does yet know
   nothing respecting moral, spiritual objects, as he ought to know, and
   must know, in order to have the true knowledge of God. "But if any man
   love God, he (that is, God) is known by him." [554] That is, if any man
   have love, he is illuminated, and has true light and knowledge, which
   does not consist in mere speculation, but in the sensations and taste
   of the heart, by which he discerns the divine character with
   approbation, and knows the only true God; which is the knowledge that
   all men ought to have, as they are commanded to love, and all their
   duty lies in this. All mere speculative knowledge that is possible to
   be attained without love, leaves men in total moral darkness, in the
   exercise of selfishness and pride, in opposition to every part and
   degree of their duty.

   Agreeable to this, the same apostle says, "With the heart man believeth
   unto righteousness." [555] That light and discerning respecting the
   truths of the gospel, and the character of Christ, which is implied in
   true faith, is not mere speculation, but depends on the disposition and
   exercises of the heart. Therefore Christ says to the Jews, "how can ye
   believe, which receive honour one of another; and seek not the honour
   which cometh from God only?" [556] In these words it is declared that
   selfishness and pride, which are directly opposed to that love which
   consists in disinterested affection, do blind the mind to spiritual
   objects, and effectually shut out that light and discerning which is
   essential to faith in Christ; and that they only whose hearts are
   benevolent and humble, have the true light, and see spiritual objects
   as faith beholds them.

   We are taught the same thing by Christ, when speaking expressly and
   particularly of illumination. His words are, "The light of the body is
   the eye: If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full
   of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
   darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee, be darkness, how
   great is that darkness." [557] Our divine teacher is here speaking of
   moral or spiritual light and darkness, and says, that these are as the
   eye of the mind is, and depend on the single or evil eye. If we attend
   to the scripture, we may learn what is meant by the single and evil
   eye. Jesus Christ says, "From within, out of the heart of men, proceed
   evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness,
   wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,
   foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the
   man." [558] From these words we learn, that an evil eye belongs to the
   heart, and is an exercise of the heart, as it cometh out of the heart.
   Therefore it is of a moral nature, and is itself criminal, as it is
   called an evil thing, and is ranked among other things, which are moral
   evils or sins, and defile men. We may infer from this with great
   certainty, that moral darkness belongs to the heart, and not the
   intellect, as distinguished from that.--That it consists in the
   exercise of the heart, and is in itself criminal, in every degree of
   it.

   And it may with equal certainty be determined, from other passages of
   scripture, what is the particular nature of that disposition and
   exercise which is called an evil eye, and in what this evil eye
   consists. Our Lord represents the householder, who hired men to work in
   his vineyard, at different times in the day, and ordered his steward to
   give as much wages to those who had laboured but one hour, as to those
   who had laboured the whole day; as saying to one of the latter who
   complained of this, "Is thine eye evil, because I am good?" [559] Here
   a contracted, selfish, envious spirit, is called an evil eye; and is
   opposed to goodness of heart, of benevolence, which is here called a
   good eye; and must be the same with a single eye. An evil eye always
   means selfishness, and that affection of heart which is included in it,
   whenever it is mentioned in the scripture. There are the following
   instances of this. When God commands the Israelites to open their hand
   wide, and give liberally to their poor brethren, he adds the following
   words; "Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,
   the seventh year, the year of release is at hand: And thine eye be evil
   against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought, and he cry unto
   the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee." [560] Here again, an
   evil eye is a selfish disposition of heart, in opposition to goodness
   or benevolence of heart. The same thing is denoted by an evil eye in
   the following passages: "Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an
   evil eye; neither desire thou his dainty meat. For as be thinketh in
   his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is
   not with thee." [561] Here his evil eye consists in the thoughts and
   disposition of his heart, which are opposed to his generous benevolent
   expressions, and really against his guest, which can be nothing but a
   selfish, covetous disposition, "He that hasteth to be rich, hath an
   evil eye." [562] Nothing but a selfish, inordinate craving, and a
   covetous spirit, will prompt men to make haste to be rich.

   Having found what an evil eye is, that it consists in that disposition
   and those exercises of heart which are evil and criminal, in that self
   love which is contrary to benevolence and true goodness of heart, and
   fills the mind with moral darkness; it is easy to determine what is
   meant by a single eye, viz. that disposition of heart, which is opposed
   to selfishness. It is an upright, good, benevolent heart, or true,
   disinterested, benevolent love. This is evident from the passages of
   scripture already mentioned. A liberal, benevolent disposition, and a
   good eye, which is the same, is set in opposition to an evil eye. The
   single eye is the same with a bountiful eye. "He that hath a bountiful
   eye shall be blessed: For he giveth of his bread to the poor." [563]

   That the single eye consists in benevolence and goodness of heart, is
   evident, (if any farther evidence be needed) in that the word in the
   original aplous, translated single, when a substantive, aplotes, is
   used for liberality, bountifulness, or benevolence. It is so used in
   the following passages of scripture. "He that giveth, let him do it
   with simplicity." [aplotesti] That is, with a liberal, bountiful heart.
   [564]

   "How that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy,
   and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality."
   [565] [aplotetos] "Being enriched in every thing, to all bountifulness"
   [566] [eis pasan aploteta] "While, by the experiment of this
   ministration, they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the
   gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution [aplotet tes
   koinoni'as unto them, and unto all men." [567] "Who giveth to all men
   liberally, [aplos] and upbraideth not." [568]

   It is easy to see that this representation of a single and an evil eye
   agrees exactly with those passages of scripture which have been
   mentioned above, in which disinterested love, as opposed to
   selfishness, is spoken of as essential to true light and discerning,
   with respect to things of a moral nature; so that he who loveth,
   knoweth God, and he who loveth not, knoweth not God; and consequently
   has no true knowledge of the things of the moral world; but is in total
   darkness. And that self love, by which a man hateth his brother, is
   moral darkness itself, and causeth him to walk in darkness. Herein the
   apostles perfectly agree with Jesus Christ, when he says that a single
   eye, that is, love, or a benevolent disposition of heart, is that which
   illuminates the mind, and is moral light and discerning: And that the
   evil eye, that is, selfishness, is moral darkness, and holds die mind
   in this darkness, where it reigns. Love or universal, disinterested
   benevolence, which implies all moral goodness, or righteousness and
   holiness, is the single eye which illuminates the mind, and fills the
   heart with moral divine light. This single eye fixes on one grand
   object, the glory of God, which implies the greatest good of his
   eternal kingdom, and the best good of every individual creature, so far
   as it tends to promote the general good, or is consistent with it. The
   evil eye is selfishness, and all that is implied in this, in which all
   moral evil or sin consists. This is moral blindness, or spiritual
   darkness; and while the heart is under the dominion of this, all the
   light which is set before the man, and all his speculations, will not
   in the least remove this darkness, but all the light that is in him is
   darkness. And "how great is that darkness!"

   The same thing is asserted by Jesus Christ in the following passages.
   "Every one that doeth evil," that is, is wholly selfish in all he does,
   "hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should
   be reproved. But he that doth truth," he that loveth, "cometh to the
   light." [569] "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
   doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." [570] He
   only doth the will of God who loveth: He shall know God and Christ; he
   and he only has light and discerning to see and know the truth, and
   distinguish it from error.

   St. Paul sets this point in the same light, when he says, "And this I
   pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge, and in
   all judgment." [571] The word here translated judgment, signifies taste
   and sensibility of heart, which is true moral light and discerning.
   This knowledge and judgment is here represented as consisting in love,
   or the concomitant or fruit of it.

   The above scriptural account of the moral darkness of the minds of
   depraved men, and of divine illumination or spiritual light and
   discerning, is agreeable to reason, and supported by it; and is implied
   in what has been generally granted by those who have attended to the
   subject. It has been generally, if not universally conceded, and seems
   to be a plain dictate of reason and common sense, that the inordinate
   lusts of men, when they prevail and govern, do blind their minds with
   respect to moral objects: so that those lusts and evil inclinations of
   men must be suppressed, and mortified, in some degree, at least, in
   order to their discerning these objects, and seeing them in a true and
   proper light. The man who gives himself up to covetousness and worldly
   pursuits, to unrighteousness or sensuality, must, by the reigning of
   any or all of these lusts, be blind to the beauty and excellence of
   spiritual, moral objects, and truths, and those exercises of mind in
   which true virtue and holiness consists. And there is no other way to
   recover such an one to a true and proper discerning of the reality,
   importance, the beauty and excellence of the truths and objects of the
   moral world, including God, his law, Jesus Christ, the gospel, the
   nature and excellence of true religion, but by an alteration in the
   taste, disposition and desires of his heart, and recovering him to a
   contrary taste and disposition of mind.

   And it is equally reasonable and certain that the more inward lusts of
   the heart, selfishness and pride, which are the essence, root, strength
   and support of these lusts which have been mentioned, and of all
   others, should be attended with moral blindness, where they reign, and
   are blindness, and moral darkness itself: And that true illumination
   and moral light consist in an opposite disposition and taste of mind.
   Things of a moral nature have relation to the exercises of the heart;
   and sin and holiness consist in self love and benevolence, as has been
   shown. He whose heart is destitute of benevolent affection can have no
   true idea of it, because ideas of exercises of heart are obtained by
   having exercises of that kind, and no other way. Therefore he who
   exercises no true love, knows not the true moral character of God; for
   this consists in love. And when this affection takes place in his
   heart, he has spiritual discerning, moral light breaks in upon his
   mind, he is turned from darkness to light, and sees and knows God, in
   his true moral character, and has some right view of things of the
   moral world. Agreeable to this, Solomon says, "Evil men understand not
   judgment: But they that seek the Lord, understand all things." [572]

   This light and discerning, by which the true beauty and excellence of
   moral objects is seen, is not attainable by any kind or degree of mere
   intellectual speculation, as distinguished from relish and exercise of
   the heart. Moral beauty, amiableness and excellence is not the object
   of mere intellect or understanding, as distinguished from the will or
   heart; it is the object of taste, which belongs to the heart, and
   implies inclination and exercise of heart, and consists in it. Beauty
   and amiableness is discerned by taste; and seeing beauty implies
   inclination to it, or love of it. Benevolent, disinterested affection,
   which, as has been observed, is the single eye, is that in which true
   moral taste consists. This belongs to the heart, and where this exists,
   things of the moral world appear in their true beauty and amiableness,
   and are relished and loved. On the contrary, self love, which implies
   every sinful affection and lust, is that in which a wrong bias and
   taste of heart consists. It is blind to moral beauty; and those moral
   objects and affections, in which all the true beauty, amiableness and
   excellence in the universe consist, appear disagreeable and odious, so
   far as they are seen, which is real aversion, and hatred of them. This
   is blindness indeed! The only moral blindness, and the greatest
   darkness and delusion that can be in nature. It calls evil good, and
   good evil; it puts darkness for light, and light for darkness; bitter
   for sweet, and sweet for bitter. [573]

   This will appear more evident and clear, perhaps, by considering the
   nature and tendency of self love, which comprehends every vice and lust
   of the mind, and is exercised in all sin; and the opposite nature of
   universal disinterested benevolence, in which all true virtue is
   implied.

   Self love is an evil eye, which will not admit the light that discovers
   and brings into clear view, all the grand, beautiful and glorious
   objects in the moral world. It is fast shut against all those, and
   excludes them wholly from sight. It sees and regards but one infinitely
   little, diminutive object, self; it sinks the mind down and contracts
   it to this, and will not look at any other object, or interest, but
   this contracted selfish one. It feels as if this was the great and only
   interest, and subordinates every other being and interest, and every
   possible public good, to a private personal interest, seeing no other
   good but that which is suited to promote a personal, selfish good. This
   self love is therefore, in the nature of it, total blindness to the
   infinite importance of the being of God, and the amiableness and
   excellence of his character; and to the worth and glory of his kingdom,
   and desirableness of the greatest public good. And consequently, does
   not see the amiableness and worth of that disinterested, universal
   benevolence, which seeks the greatest good of the whole, and fixes on
   this, as the grand and most desirable object, and subordinates the
   interest of individuals to the common interest, and greatest good of
   the whole; and cannot have any relish or taste for this; but must be
   displeased with it and hate it, and all the beings who are of this
   character, as they are disposed to sacrifice and give up all his
   personal interest, which he holds as the only good, when necessary to
   promote the general good. This self love therefore is enmity against
   God, and the general good; and that affection must be hateful to the
   selfish person, which seeks the glory of God, and the greatest good of
   his kingdom, and does not regard, but gives up the interest of
   individuals, so far as the latter is inconsistent with the former. Thus
   self love is totally blind to the only great and real good in the
   universe, and to all the true beauty and excellence in it: This is the
   blindness, the darkness and deception of every one who loves his own
   self only. This darkness, as it has its foundation in the heart, and
   consists in the reigning affection of it, cannot be removed by any
   merely intellectual light, knowledge and reasoning, but remains in its
   greatness and full strength, whatever the understanding, considered as
   distinct from the will, may dictate, as there is no connection between
   mere intellectual knowledge, and the taste and inclination of the
   heart, and the former cannot alter the latter. This is verified by
   experience, in the innumerable instances of the taste and inclination
   of the heart contradicting and counteracting the conviction and
   dictates of the understanding, the former choosing that as good and
   best, and pursuing it, while the latter pronounces it to be wrong and
   evil. [574]

   Disinterested, universal benevolence, or that disposition of heart
   which implies this, which is "an honest and good, or benevolent heart,"
   is the single eye. This gives that light to the mind, in which it
   discerns the grand objects comprised in universal being; and sees what
   is the true, the greatest and only good of the universe; and fixes on
   this as the first object of choice and pursuit. This brings into view
   the first cause of all, the infinite source, and the sum of all being,
   as really existing, and sees him to be the first and great object of
   regard and benevolence. This discerns, tastes and relishes the true
   moral beauty and excellence of universal benevolence; approves of it
   and delights in it as the supreme moral good, and as comprehending the
   whole of it. It sees God as infinitely great, and infinitely benevolent
   or good, rejoices in his felicity and glory, and says, "Let him reign
   supreme, and be glorified to the highest degree forever," as involving
   the greatest good, the highest happiness and glory of his kingdom: It
   is pleased with the divine moral character, comprehended in his
   infinite benevolence or goodness, and delights in it above all things
   else. Thus he who loveth, knoweth God, for God is love.

   And he who has this honest and good heart, this dis. interested,
   benevolent affection, sees the beauty, importance, righteousness and
   goodness of the law of God, which requires perfect love, universal
   benevolence, with all that affection which is involved in it, of every
   moral agent, on pain of his highest displeasure. He consequently sees
   all opposition to this law to be infinitely odious and detestable; and
   therefore views his own character, as a sinner, as unspeakably hateful,
   and, abhors himself, and sees the reason why God does hate all sin, and
   the propriety and desirableness that he should express and manifest his
   high displeasure at it, and infinite opposition to it, in threatening
   it with a just, deserved, endless punishment. And by all this, he is
   prepared to behold and understand the gospel, and see the truth, wisdom
   and glory of it, which exhibits infinite benevolence in the most
   advantageous and striking light, and is suited in the best manner to
   promote the honour of God, and the greatest happiness of his kingdom.
   And the character of Christ will come into view as infinitely amiable,
   worthy and important; and the benevolent heart will approve, love and
   rejoice. This is that knowledge of the only true God, and Jesus Christ
   whom he has sent, which is eternal life: It is the light of life, which
   is the attainment of all the followers of Christ. He who hath this
   love, "abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in
   him." [575]

   From all that has been now observed on this subject, it is easy to see,
   that divine illumination is effected by the renovation of the heart of
   man, by the Spirit of God, by which it is no longer wholly selfish, and
   under the dominion of pride and lust; but is formed to universal,
   disinterested benevolence, or true love. Nothing is wanting but such a
   change of heart, in order to the true light of the moral world shining
   into it. By this renovation the single eye is formed, and the mind is
   full of light. This is that change, and illumination which is ascribed
   in scripture to the Spirit of God. This is that change of heart which
   Jesus calls a being born again of the Spirit, without which men cannot
   see the kingdom of God. [576] And by which their eyes are opened, and
   they are turned from darkness to marvellous light, and know the only
   true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. By this renovation a wise
   and understanding heart is given, and God gives a heart to know him.
   And he shines in the heart, by giving this single eye, to give the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus
   Christ. [577] This is the same with giving a new heart, and a new
   spirit. [578] And is expressed in the following words: "I will put my
   laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts. And they shall
   not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying,
   know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
   [579] Jesus Christ speaks of this illumination when he says, "It is
   written in the prophets, and they shall all be taught of God. Every one
   therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto
   me." [580] And when he says to Peter, upon his professing his faith in
   him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, "Blessed art thou, Simon
   Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
   Father which is in heaven." [581] St. Paul speaks of this renovation of
   heart as necessary in order to true light and knowledge, and that the
   latter is implied in the former. "Be not conformed to this world: But
   be ye transformed, by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what
   is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God." [582]

   This illumination, therefore, does not consist in discovering, or
   revealing to men any new truth not already made known and contained in
   divine revelation; but in forming the heart to true discerning, and
   hereby opening the eye of the mind, to see the truths revealed in the
   scriptures; or in forming the single eye, which will receive the light,
   which before shined; but was not admitted, and could not shine in the
   heart, because the eye was evil, and shut against the truth. This is
   expressed by the Psalmist in the following words: "Open thou mine eyes,
   that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law." [583] The scriptures
   contain a fulness of moral light and instruction; they will make him
   wise unto salvation, who understands and believes; who discerns the
   truths there revealed. There is therefore no need that any new truth
   should be immediately suggested to the mind which is not contained in
   the Bible. All that is wanting, is to have the mind disposed and
   prepared to receive the light which is extant, and shines in the word
   of God: This is to have a single eye, a new, benevolent heart. He who
   has such an heart, is hereby brought into a new moral world; sees the
   things revealed in the scriptures in a new light; they now appear in
   their reality and divinity, beautiful, consistent, harmonious,
   important, and affecting, as they never did before, infinitely above
   any thing else that can be imagined. Thus the light shines in the heart
   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of
   Jesus Christ. [584] This establishes the heart in a belief and
   assurance of the truth of the gospel and of divine revelation, as no
   degree of mere speculation can do. This is expressed by St. John in the
   following words: "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given
   us an understanding that we may know him that is true. This is the true
   God, and eternal life." [585]

   As the renovation of the heart is but in a small degree at first, and
   the eye of the mind is not fully opened at once; but this work is begun
   in an imperfect degree, and carried on to perfection: So this light is
   comparatively small and imperfect in the beginning, and gradually
   increases, and the christian grows in grace, in holiness, and in the
   knowledge of Jesus Christ, which implies the knowledge of all divine
   things. "The path of the just is as the shining light, which shineth
   more and more to the perfect day." And as the enlightened mind sees but
   in part, in this world, and is never omniscient, some truths and
   objects are more particularly and clearly in view at one time, and
   others at another: which may be owing to particular divine internal
   influence, or the agency of other invisible beings, or to external
   circumstances, and occurrences; all which are under the immediate
   influence and guidance of the omnipotent, omnipresent, all-wise Being,
   who worketh all in all. [586]

   It is proper to observe here, that though the heart or will be the seat
   of this illumination, and moral light and darkness are as the
   disposition of the heart is, yet the whole mind, in all the faculties
   of it, is concerned, and some way included and affected in this affair.
   Intellectual light and conviction, considered as distinct from the
   heart, is included in this illumination. Ideas are conveyed to the
   heart by this medium. Where there are no speculative ideas, which are
   in some measure agreeable to the truth, and no right judgment and
   conviction respecting intellectual objects; the benevolent heart will
   not be properly illuminated, or be under advantage to exercise itself
   properly towards external objects. When the single eye is formed, it
   will receive light and view the objects of moral sight, by the medium
   of the intellect. Therefore there appears to be a propriety, that there
   should be some degree of speculative light and conviction in the minds
   of the adult, before a new heart or single eye is given, in order to
   prepare them to discern the truth properly, and to have exercises
   agreeable to it.

   And when a new heart, a single eye is given, it will help to rectify
   the mistakes which may have been made by the intellectual judgment, as
   the latter is influenced and biassed in judging of things by the taste
   and inclination of the heart. So far as the heart is honest and good,
   the prejudices which bias the speculative judgment will be removed, and
   the mind will speculate more clearly, and a conviction of the truth
   will be more clear, strong and steady; and the attention of the mind to
   moral divine subjects will be more fixed and engaged, and a foundation
   is laid for die enlargement of the mind in intellectual knowledge of
   these things, and the rational powers of the soul; for the taste and
   benevolent exercises of the new heart, are perfectly rational, and will
   be approved by right reason, and a rectified judgment. Thus, by the
   renovation of the heart, forming it to a right taste, a disposition to
   disinterested benevolence, all the powers of the soul are sanctified;
   the ignorance and mistakes of reason and judgment, which originated
   from an evil eye, or self love, are removed; the whole mind is
   enlightened, and all the faculties of the soul harmonize, and do their
   office well. When the heart is perfectly right, in the exercise of
   benevolent, disinterested affection, the soul is full of light, and the
   man is perfectly holy, in all his faculties and powers.

   The sum of what has been said above on the subject of divine
   illumination is this. As all mankind are, while in their natural state,
   totally depraved and sinful, and this depravity is in the nature of it
   moral darkness, they are wholly blind to the things of the Spirit of
   God. This blindness has its foundation in the heart, and consists in
   the wrong taste and sinful inclination of that, and not in any natural
   defect in the intellectual and reasoning faculties of the soul, as
   distinguished from the inclination of the heart. This blindness is
   therefore a wilful blindness, as it consists in the disposition, and
   exercise of the heart or will. They have eyes, they have all the
   natural mental faculties, which are necessary to discern spiritual
   things, as well as any other objects: But they see them not, because
   they voluntarily shut their eyes, and refuse to open them, and admit
   the light which shines around them, as this light of divine truth is
   above all things disagreeable to them; they hate it, and will not come
   unto it, lest their deeds should be reproved. This blindness is
   therefore wholly the fault of man, and criminal in every degree of it,
   being moral depravity itself. It consists in self love, which implies
   the whole of moral depravity, of every thing in the heart that is or
   can be contrary to the law of God. This is the evil eye, which fills
   the whole mind with moral darkness. This is blindness to invisible
   spiritual things; does not see the beauty, consistence and harmony of
   moral truth; and therefore has no sense and cordial belief of their
   reality, or that they do indeed exist, whatever reason and speculative
   judgment may dictate. Therefore, "The fool," every man in his natural
   state, who is in this moral darkness, "saith in his heart, there is no
   God." [587] This is the feeling and language of a heart wholly depraved
   and under the power of self love: Which cannot be removed by any mere
   speculations and reasoning on the subject, so long as the heart is thus
   wholly corrupt. And this selfishness and pride, with all the lusts
   implied in this, tend to weaken and pervert the reasoning powers of the
   mind, and bribe and bias the reason and speculative judgment, so as to
   reject the truth, and embrace error in speculation, respecting things
   of a moral nature. And this is the ground and source of all the false,
   unreasonable reasoning, and errors in judgment upon subjects of a moral
   nature, which do take place among mankind. And therefore all false
   reasoning, and every error and delusion in speculation and judgment, is
   blameable and sinful, as all these have their foundation in the corrupt
   biasses of the heart, and are altogether governed and produced by them.

   The real christian is, in becoming such, turned from this darkness to
   marvellous light, which is effected by the omnipotent influences of the
   Spirit of God, in the renovation of the heart, which was before totally
   corrupt, forming it to disinterested, universal benevolence, and so
   making it an honest and good heart; and forming the single eye, by
   which the truths revealed in the scriptures, relating to the being and
   perfections of God, his law and moral government; the state and
   character of man; the character and works of the Mediator; the way of
   salvation by him; the nature of duty and true holiness, &c. are seen in
   their true light, as realities, beautiful, divine, important,
   excellent, harmonious, glorious, and above all things else interesting
   and affecting; and the mind is filled with this spiritual, marvellous,
   glorious light. By this all the powers of the mind are enlarged and
   strengthened. Reason and judgment, being no longer biassed by an evil
   heart, are rectified,, and the reasoning, speculative faculty, is
   exerted in an honest, attentive pursuit, in the investigation of truth.

   Though the blindness of man in his natural, totally depraved state, be
   of a moral nature, and voluntary, and therefore wholly criminal; yet it
   is as great, and is as much beyond the power of means to remove it; and
   the man is as far from recovering himself to light, as if the blindness
   was owing to an essential defect in the natural powers of the soul: And
   the immediate, almighty energy of the divine Spirit is as necessary to
   remove this darkness, and illuminate the mind, as if natural faculties
   were wanting. Therefore this illumination is constantly ascribed in the
   scripture to God, as the agent and cause in producing this effect. It
   is a common observation, in which all agree, that none are blinder than
   they who will not see. They have eyes, but see not. He who has eyes,
   and shuts them fast, and will not open them to admit the light, from an
   obstinate aversion from the light, is as much in the dark, as he who
   has no eyes; and the former can be no more made to see, than the
   latter, so long as his will is obstinately set against opening his
   eyes. And it may require the same power and agent to alter his
   disposition, and give him a contrary one, that is necessary to give
   eyes to him who has none. Yea, in the case before us, a greater
   exertion of power is necessary to form the single eye, than to create
   the natural faculties of the soul; for the former is effected in
   opposition to the whole strength of the will, and of Satan, who
   possesses the corrupt heart, and blinds the mind of them who do not
   believe; whereas there can be no opposition to the latter. Therefore
   this illumination is said in the scripture to be the effect of the
   exceeding great and mighty power of God. [588]

IMPROVEMENT.

   I. From the view we have now had of divine illumination, we are led
   particularly to reflect on the mistake many have made, in supposing
   that this saving light is communicated to the understanding,
   independent of the will or heart, and considered as a power distinct
   from it; that this light has its seat in the understanding, and belongs
   to that, and not to the will, the former, and not the latter, being the
   leading, governing power of the mind. This is not agreeable to the
   representation of the matter in the scripture, as has been shown. And
   this is not only unscriptural, but leads to dangerous and hurtful
   consequences.

   It has not been uncommon to represent the moral depravity of man, to
   consist in the understanding being darkened, as a distinct thing from
   the moral disorders and corruption of the heart; and to speak of
   enlightening the understanding, and subduing the will, or renewing the
   heart, as two distinct and different operations. This tends to darken
   and confuse the subject of divine illumination, and places it in that,
   in which it does not consist, according to the scriptures. And it
   represents the blindness of men to things of the Spirit of God, as a
   natural defect, and not in the least criminal, since the understanding,
   as distinguished from the will or heart, is not capable of virtue or
   vice, or of any thing that is criminal. For whatever darkness there be
   in the understanding, which is independent of the will, and does not
   originate from that, it is not a moral disorder, but purely natural;
   and therefore cannot be blameable. This way of representing this matter
   has therefore, doubtless, led many to consider the darkness in which
   all unrenewed men are, with respect to the things of the Spirit of God,
   as being in no degree criminal: And many, if not most, who have
   considered themselves in this state of darkness, have viewed it only as
   an unhappiness, and not as their sin.

   Others have supposed that nothing is necessary in order to enlighten
   men, and their becoming virtuous and holy, but to have light take place
   in the understanding, that the proper illumination of this, will
   influence and gain the will to a compliance with that which reason
   dictates to be truth, to be right and best. Of these, some suppose that
   nothing is done, in order to enlighten the understanding, and lead men
   to reason and judge right, but to set light before them by external
   application, in a way suited to excite the attention, &c. Others
   suppose a powerful divine operation is necessary to let that light and
   conviction into the understanding, which will effectually move the will
   to choose that which is right, and persuade the heart to love God, and
   embrace the gospel, &c. Both these really deny the moral depravity of
   man, either expressly or implicitly; at least, that the heart is
   totally corrupt. For if the will be always disposed and ready to comply
   with the truth whenever the understanding is convinced of it, and sees
   it; then the will is not depraved, there is no obstinacy and rebellion
   in the heart. All the defect is in the understanding, in not dictating
   the truth to the heart. But this defect in the understanding, however
   great it may be, is not a moral, but a natural defect: For, as has been
   shown, the understanding, considered as not including the will or
   heart, or the mere speculative faculty of the soul, is not a moral
   faculty, and is not capable of virtue or vice. According to this, the
   heart cannot be faulty, while it acts according to the dictates of the
   understanding, whatever they may be, which it is supposed always to do,
   and therefore never can be guilty of any moral evil: And the
   understanding, as such, and as distinguished from the will, is
   incapable of fault. Therefore there can be no such thing as moral evil,
   or sin; to be sure, man is not capable of any such thing.

   It appears from what has been said on this subject, that all these
   suppositions are contrary to the representation which the scripture
   gives of this matter, and not agreeable to reason, or to fact and
   experience. They who thus set the understanding or intellect,
   considered as a faculty distinct from the will, first, as the leading
   faculty of the soul, by which the will is in all cases directed and
   governed, do certainly make a great mistake, and turn things upside
   down. The will is the only active faculty of the soul. The
   understanding, so far as it can be considered as a distinct faculty,
   and not implying any degree of will, is wholly passive, and not capable
   of action. Every motion and action of the mind of man is voluntary; and
   therefore is the motion or action of the will. All mental exercise
   originates in the will, which is the seat of all moral action.

   Besides, they suppose what is in the nature of things absolutely
   impossible, and build their whole theory upon it, viz. That the
   understanding, independent of the heart, is capable of receiving or
   having a true idea of moral exercise, or of the real beauty and
   excellence of the things of the Spirit of God. Such ideas suppose taste
   and affection of heart, without which they cannot be perceived, or take
   place in the mind. This is as impossible, as that a blind man should
   have a true idea of the beauty of light and colours; or that a man may
   perceive the sweetness of honey, and be pleased with it, by mere
   reasoning upon it, or touching it with his finger, while he has not the
   least degree of taste or relish for it, as has been before observed.

   II. From what has been said on this subject, other mistakes which have
   been made about divine illumination, are detected, and appear to be
   delusive and dangerous. Some have thought they were savingly
   enlightened, by their being led to see, in an unaccountable manner to
   them, an extraordinary external light and brightness; either by their
   bodily eyes, or in their imagination, which has affected them much. Or
   they have had their eyes opened, as they suppose, clearly to see Christ
   on the cross, or seated in heaven; and heaven, and the inhabitants of
   it, have been seen by them, &c. All things of this kind, are as far
   from spiritual discoveries, as darkness is from light, and are mere
   imaginary conceptions, of which he who has the most depraved heart is
   as capable as any other person. And as they do not suppose a renewed
   heart, so they have no tendency to make it better.

   Others have thought themselves divinely taught and illuminated, by
   having some new thing, which they call truth, suggested to their minds,
   by a voice from heaven, or some immediate impulse, which is not
   contained in the Bible. And not a few, instead of learning their duty
   from the Bible, have expected, and thought they have had light, and
   direction given to them immediately from heaven, to make known what
   they were to say and do: and have thought themselves directed, in all
   their actions, by some invisible, divine impulse. All these are not
   only entirely different from divine illumination; but are dangerous
   delusions; and have proved fatal to many who have depended upon them.

   Imaginary ideas may attend divine illumination, and often do, in this
   very imperfect state: That is, a person may have a discerning heart
   given to him, by which he sees the saving truth; yet by the influence
   of his imagination, he may have many ideas imposed on his mind, which
   accompany the true light which shines in his heart But these mere
   imaginary ideas, are no part of the truth, which the enlightened mind
   sees; and therefore ought not to be regarded as such.

   III. We are led by this subject, more particularly to reflect upon the
   total and very great criminality of moral blindness, which is opposed
   to divine illumination. This has been brought into view, in considering
   this subject; and it is of importance that it should be always
   remembered, believed and realized by every person. Since this darkness
   consists wholly in the sinful inclinations of the heart, it must be
   wholly sinful. And the greater, the more strong and fixed it is, the
   more criminal it must be. The necessity of divine influence and power,
   in order to remove this darkness, is so far from proving it no crime,
   that it is a demonstrative evidence that it is a very great crime; as
   it is so strongly fixed in the heart. We are, and must be, under
   obligation to understand and approve all that moral truth, of which our
   natural capacities are capable, and which we have opportunity and are
   under advantage to see. All that blindness and error which is contrary
   to this, and prevents our seeing it, is contrary to our obligation, a
   violation of it; and therefore altogether criminal. There is a great
   difference between a person who has no eyes, and therefore cannot see
   the light, it being naturally impossible; and another who has good
   eyes, but from an aversion from seeing, shuts them fast, and will not
   open them to admit the light. The former cannot be under obligation to
   see, or blamed for not seeing; the latter may, and it is wholly his own
   fault, that he does not see. The scripture represents moral blindness
   by this, and says, men have eyes, and see not, because they hate the
   light, and shut their eyes.

   We are wholly blameable, and have no excuse for all our blindness
   respecting the things of the Spirit of God, and for every error and
   mistake into which we fall, concerning things of a moral nature; and
   the greater our blindness is, and the more gross and numerous are our
   errors and mistakes in these things, and the more clear the light is,
   which is set before us, the more inexcusable and guilty we are. Our
   Saviour says, "If the light which is in thee, be darkness, how great is
   that darkness!" And we are prepared now to say, if all this great
   darkness be wholly criminal, and that in proportion to the greatness of
   it, how great is our guilt!

   IV. How reasonable is it that men should be called upon and commanded
   to open their eyes, and see, in a moral sense! It has been observed,
   that God does so, in the scripture. He says, "O ye simple, understand
   wisdom, and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart." [589] If men
   be wholly blameable for not seeing when God has given them capacity to
   see, and sets light before them, and their blindness be wholly wilful;
   no reason can be given why they should not be exhorted and commanded to
   do what they ought to do, and can have no excuse for not doing it,
   however fixed and obstinate they are in their blindness, and however
   far they are from a disposition, or moral power or possibility to come
   to the light, from their fixed and strong hatred of it; so that they
   never will obey, if left to themselves. It is of great importance that
   this should be well understood and believed, as it is necessary in
   order to our understanding the scripture, and our own character and
   blameableness.

   [573] Isa. v. 20.--All this is implied in what Hierocles, a heathen,
   has observed and asserted, viz. "The mind, destitute of virtue, cannot
   see the beauty of truth." "Spiritual understanding consists primarily
   In a sense of heart of spiritual beauty; I say, a sense of heart; for
   it is not speculation merely that is concerned in this kind of
   understanding: Nor can there be a clear distinction made between the
   two faculties of understanding and will, as: acting distinctly and
   separately, in this matter. When the mind is sensible of the sweet
   beauty and amiableness of a thing, that implies a sensibleness of
   sweetness and delight in the presence of the idea of it. And this
   sensibleness of the amiableness or delightfulness of beauty, carries in
   the very nature of it the sense of the heart; or an effect and
   impression the soul is the subject of, as a subject possessed of taste,
   inclination and will." Edwards on Gracious Affections. Page 163, 164.
   First edition.

   [574] This was perceived by a heathen poet, and expressed in the
   following words: Sed trahit invitam nova vis, aliudque cupido; Mens
   aliud suadet. Video meliora proboque: Deteriora sequor.-- Translated
   thus. "My reason this, my passion that, persuades; "I see the right,
   and I approve it too, "Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue."
