TO THE

   Judicious and Impartial

READER

   Courteous Reader,

   It is now many years since divers of us (with other sober Christians
   then living and walking in the way of the Lord that we professe) did
   conceive our selves to be under a necessity of Publishing a Confession
   of our Faith, for the information, and satisfaction of those, that did
   not throughly understand what our principles were, or had entertained
   prejudices against our Profession, by reason of the strange
   representation of them, by some men of note, who had taken very wrong
   measures, and accordingly led others into misapprehensions, of us, and
   them: and this was first put forth about the year, 1643. in the name of
   seven Congregations then gathered in London; since which time, diverse
   impressions thereof have been dispersed abroad, and our end proposed,
   in good measure answered, inasmuch as many (and some of those men
   eminent, both for piety and learning) were thereby satisfied, that we
   were no way guilty of those Heterodoxies and fundamental errors, which
   had too frequently been charged upon us without ground, or occasion
   given on our part. And forasmuch, as that Confession is not now
   commonly to be had; and also that many others have since embraced the
   same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to
   joyn together in giving a testimony to the world; of our firm adhering
   to those wholesome Principles, by the publication of this which is now
   in your hand.

   And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments,
   in this, doth vary from the former (although the substance of the
   matter is the same) we shall freely impart to you the reason and
   occasion thereof. One thing that greatly prevailed with us to undertake
   this work, was (not only to give a full account of our selves, to those
   Christians that differ from us about the subject of Baptism, but also)
   the profit that might from thence arise, unto those that have any
   account of our labors, in their instruction, and establishment in the
   great truths of the Gospel; in the clear understanding, and steady
   belief of which, our comfortable walking with God, and fruitfulness
   before him, in all our ways, is most neerly concerned; and therefore we
   did conclude it necessary to expresse our selves the more fully, and
   distinctly; and also to fix on such a method as might be most
   comprehensive of those things which we designed to explain our sense,
   and belief of; and finding no defect, in this regard, in that fixed on
   by the assembly, and after them by those of the Congregational way, we
   did readily conclude it best to retain the same order in our present
   confession: and also, when we observed that those last mentioned, did
   in their confession (for reasons which seemed of weight both to
   themselves and others) choose not only to express their mind in words
   concurrent with the former in sense, concerning all those articles
   wherein they were agreed, but also for the most part without any
   variation of the terms we did in like manner conclude it best to follow
   their example in making use of the very same words with them both, in
   these articles (which are very many) wherein our faith and doctrine is
   the same with theirs, and this we did, the more abundantly, to manifest
   our consent with both, in all the fundamental articles of the Christian
   Religion, as also with many others, whose orthodox confessions have
   been published to the world; on behalf of the Protestants in divers
   Nations and Cities: and also to convince all, that we have no itch to
   clogge Religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form
   of sound words, which hath been, in consent with the holy Scriptures,
   used by others before us; hereby declaring before God, Angels, & Men,
   our hearty agreement with them, in that wholesome Protestant Doctrine,
   which with so clear evidence of Scriptures they have asserted: some
   things indeed, are in some places added, some terms omitted, and some
   few changed, but these alterations are of that nature, as that we need
   not doubt, any charge or suspition of unsoundness in the faith, from
   any of our brethren upon the account of them.

   In those things wherein we differ from others, we have exprest our
   selves with all candor and plainness that none might entertain
   jealousie of ought secretly lodged in our breasts, that we would not
   the world should be acquainted with; yet we hope we have also observed
   those rules of modesty, and humility, as will render our freedom in
   this respect inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments are different
   from ours.

   We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture, in the margin for
   the confirmation of each article in our confession; in which work we
   have studiously indeavoured to select such as are most clear and
   pertinent, for the proof of what is asserted by us: and our earnest
   desire is, that all into whose hands this may come, would follow that
   (never enough commended) example of the noble Bereans, who searched the
   Scriptures daily, that they might find out whether the things preached
   to them were so or not.

   There is one thing more which we sincerely professe, and earnestly
   desire credence in, viz. That contention is most remote from our design
   in all that we have done in this matter: and we hope the liberty of an
   ingenuous unfolding our principles, and opening our hearts unto our
   Brethren, with the Scripture grounds on which our faith and practise
   leanes, will by none of them be either denyed to us, or taken ill from
   us. Our whole design is accomplished, if we may obtain that Justice, as
   to be measured in our principles, and practise, and the judgement of
   both by others, according to what we have now published; which the Lord
   (whose eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to be the doctrine, which
   with our hearts we must firmly believe, and sincerely indeavour to
   conform our lives to. And oh that other contentions being laid asleep,
   the only care and contention of all upon whom the name of our blessed
   Redeemer is called, might for the future be, to walk humbly with their
   God, and in the exercise of all Love and Meekness towards each other,
   to perfect holyness in the fear of the Lord, each one endeavouring to
   have his conversation such as becometh the Gospel; and also suitable to
   his place and capacity vigorously to promote in others the practice of
   true Religion and undefiled in the sight of God and our Father. And
   that in this backsliding day, we might not spend our breath in
   fruitless complaints of the evils of others; but may every one begin at
   home, to reform in the first place our own hearts, and wayes; and then
   to quicken all that we may have influence upon, to the same work; that
   if the will of God were so, none might deceive themselves, by resting
   in, and trusting to, a form of Godliness, without the power of it, and
   inward experience of the efficacy of those truths that are professed by
   them.

   And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of Religion in
   our day, which we cannot but touch upon, and earnestly urge a redresse
   of; and that is the neglect of the worship of God in Families, by those
   to whom the charge and conduct of them is committed. May not the grosse
   ignorance, and instability of many; with the prophaneness of others, be
   justly charged upon their Parents and Masters; who have not trained
   them up in the way wherein they ought to walk when they were young? but
   have neglected those frequent and solemn commands which the Lord hath
   laid upon them so to catechize, and instruct them, that their tender
   years might be seasoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as
   revealed in the Scriptures; and also by their own omission of Prayer,
   and other duties of Religion in their families, together with the ill
   example of their loose conversation, have inured them first to a
   neglect, and then contempt of all Piety and Religion? we know this will
   not excuse the blindness, or wickedness of any; but certainly it will
   fall heavy upon those that have thus been the occasion thereof; they
   indeed dye in their sins; but will not their blood be required of those
   under whose care they were, who yet permitted them to go on without
   warning, yea led them into the paths of destruction? and will not the
   diligence of Christians with respect to the discharge of these duties,
   in ages past, rise up in judgment against, and condemn many of those
   who would be esteemed such now?

   We shall conclude with our earnest prayer, that the God of all grace,
   will pour out those measures of his holy Spirit upon us, that the
   profession of truth may be accompanyed with the sound belief, and
   diligent practise of it by us; that his name may in all things be
   glorified, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

  CHAP. I.

Of the Holy Scriptures.

   1. The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible
   [1] rule of all saving Knowledge, Faith and Obedience; Although the [2]
   light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence do so far
   manifest the goodness, wisdom and power of God, as to leave men
   unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God
   and His will, which is necessary unto Salvation. [3] Therefore it
   pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal
   himself, and to declare that His will unto his Church; and afterward
   for the better preserving, and propagating of the Truth, and for the
   more sure Establishment, and Comfort of the Church against the
   corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the World, to
   commit the same wholly unto [4] writing; which maketh the Holy
   Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of Gods revealing
   his will unto his people being now ceased.

   2. Under the Name of Holy Scripture or the Word of God written; are now
   contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament which are these,

   Of the Old Testament.

   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
   1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra,
   Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of
   Songs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel,
   Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
   Zechariah, Malachi.

   Of the new Testament.

   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Pauls Epistle to
   the Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians,
   Phillippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy,
   2 Timothy, to Titus, to Philemon, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the
   Epistle of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first,
   second and third Epistles of John, the Epistle of Jude, the Revelation.
   All which are given by the [5] inspiration of God, to be the rule of
   Faith and Life.

   3. The Books commonly called Apocrypha not being of [6] Divine
   inspiration, are no part of the Canon (or rule) of the Scripture, and
   therefore are of no authority to the Church of God, nor to be any
   otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.

   4. The Authority of the Holy Scripture for which it ought to be
   believed dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but
   wholly upon [7] God (who is truth it self) the Author thereof;
   therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.

   5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church of God,
   to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the
   heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, and the
   Majesty of the stile, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
   whole (which is to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes
   of the only way of mans salvation, and many other incomparable
   Excellencies, and intire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it
   doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet
   notwithstanding; our [8] full perswasion, and assurance of the
   infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work
   of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our Hearts.

   6. The whole Councel of God concerning all things [9] necessary for his
   own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expressely set
   down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture; unto which nothing
   at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the Spirit, or
   traditions of men.

   Nevertheless we acknowledge the [10] inward illumination of the Spirit
   of God, to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as
   are revealed in the Word, and that there are some circumstances
   concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church common to
   humane actions and societies; which are to be [11] ordered by the light
   of nature, and Christian prudence according to the general rules of the
   Word, which are always to be observed.

   7. All things in Scripture are not alike [12] plain in themselves, nor
   alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known,
   believed, and observed for Salvation, are so [13] clearly propounded,
   and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the
   learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain
   to a sufficient understanding of them.

   8. The Old Testament in [14] Hebrew, (which was the Native language of
   the people of God of old) and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
   time of the writing of it was most generally known to the Nations being
   immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and Providence
   kept pure in all Ages, are therefore [15] authentical; so as in all
   controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them
   [16] But because these original tongues are not known to all the people
   of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are
   commanded in the fear of God to read [17] and search them, therefore
   they are to be translated into the [1]vulgar language of every Nation,
   unto which they [18] come, that the Word of God dwelling [19]
   plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and
   through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.

   9. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the [20]
   Scripture it self: And therefore when there is a question about the
   true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold but one) it
   must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.

   10. The supream judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be
   determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of antient Writers,
   Doctrines of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose
   sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture
   delivered by the Spirit, into which [21] Scripture so delivered, our
   faith is finally resolved.

  CHAP. II.

Of God and of the Holy Trinity.

   1. The Lord our God is but [22] one only living, and true God; whose
   [23] subsistence is in and of himself, [24] infinite in being, and
   perfection, whose Essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself;
   [25] a most pure spirit, [26] invisible, without body, parts, or
   passions, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which no
   man can approach unto, who is [27] immutable, [28] immense, [29]
   eternal, incomprehensible, [30] Almighty, every way infinit, [31] most
   holy, most wise, most free, most absolute, [32] working all things
   according to the councel of his own immutable, and most righteous will,
   [33] for his own glory, most loving, gracious, merciful, long
   suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity,
   transgression and sin, [34] the rewarder of them that diligently seek
   him, and withall most just, [35] and terrible in his judgements, [36]
   hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the [37] guilty.

   2. God having all [38] life, [39] glory, [40] goodness, blessedness, in
   and of himself: is alone in, and unto himself all-sufficient, not [41]
   standing in need of any Creature which he hath made, nor deriving any
   glory from them, but onely manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and
   upon them, he is the alone fountain of all Being, [42] of whom, through
   whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most soveraign [43]
   dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them,
   whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight [44] all things are open and
   manifest, his knowledge is [45] infinite, infallible, and independant
   upon the Creature, so as nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain; he
   is most holy in all his Councels, in [46] all his Works, and in all his
   Commands; to him is due [47] from Angels and men, whatsoever worship,
   service, or obedience as Creatures they owe unto the Creator, and
   whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

   3. In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, [48]
   the Father the Word (or Son) and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power,
   and Eternity, each having the whole Divine Essence, [49] yet the
   Essence undivided, the Father is of none neither begotten nor
   proceeding, the Son is [50] Eternally begotten of the Father, the holy
   Spirit [51] proceeding from the Father and the Son, all infinite,
   without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in
   nature and Being; but distinguished by several peculiar, relative
   properties, and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is
   the foundation of all our Communion with God, and comfortable
   dependance on him.

  CHAP. III.

Of Gods Decree.

   1. God hath [52] Decreed in himself from all Eternity, by the most wise
   and holy Councel of his own will, freely and unchangeably, all things
   whatsoever comes to passe; yet so as thereby is God neither the author
   of sin, [53] nor hath fellowship with any therein, nor is violence
   offered to the will of the Creature, nor yet is the liberty, or
   contingency of second causes taken away, but rather [54] established,
   in which appears his wisdom in disposing all things, and power, and
   faithfulness [55] in accomplishing his Decree.

   2. Although God knoweth whatsoever may, or can come to passe upon all
   [56] supposed conditions; yet hath he not Decreed anything, [57]
   because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass
   upon such conditions.

   3. By the decree of God for the manifestation of his glory [58] some
   men and Angels, are predestinated, or fore-ordained to Eternal Life,
   through Jesus Christ to the [59] praise of his glorious grace; others
   being left to act in their sin to their [60] just condemnation, to the
   praise of his glorious justice.

   4. These Angels and Men thus predestinated, and fore-ordained, are
   particularly, and unchangeably designed; and their [61] number so
   certain, and definite, that it cannot be either increased, or
   diminished.

   5. Those of mankind [62] that are predestinated to life, God before the
   foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and
   immutable purpose, and the secret Councel and good pleasure of his
   will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his meer
   free grace and love; [63] without any other thing in the creature as a
   condition or cause moving him thereunto.

   6. As God hath appointed the Elect unto glory, so he hath by the
   eternal and most free purpose of his will, fore-ordained [64] all the
   means thereunto, wherefore they who are elected, being faln in Adam,
   [65] are redeemed by Christ, are effectually [66] called unto faith in
   Christ, by his spirit working in due season, are justifyed, adopted,
   sanctified, and kept by his power through faith [67] unto salvation;
   neither are any other redeemed by Christ, or effectually called,
   justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the Elect [68] only.

   7. The Doctrine of this high mystery of predestination, is to be
   handled with special prudence, and care; that men attending the will of
   God revealed in his word, and yeilding obedience thereunto, may from
   the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their [69]
   eternal election; so shall this doctrine afford matter [70] of praise,
   reverence, and admiration of God, and [71] of humility, diligence, and
   abundant [72] consolation, to all that sincerely obey the Gospel.

  CHAP. IV.

Of Creation.

   1. In the beginning it pleased God the Father, [73] Son, and Holy
   Spirit, for the manifestation of the glory of [74] his eternal power,
   wisdom, and goodness, to Create or make the world, and all things
   therein, [75] whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days,
   and all very good.

   2. After God had made all other Creatures, he Created [76] man, male
   and female, with [77] reasonable and immortal souls, rendring them fit
   unto that life to God; for which they were Created; being [78] made
   after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holyness;
   having the Law of God [79] written in their hearts, and power to
   fulfill it; and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to
   the liberty of their own will, which was [80] subject to change.

   3. Besides the Law written in their hearts, they received [81] a
   command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which
   whilst they kept, they were happy in their Communion with God, and had
   dominion [82] over the Creatures.

  CHAP. V.

Of Divine Providence.

   1. God the good Creator of all things, in his infinite power, and
   wisdom, doth [83] uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all Creatures,
   and things, from the greatest even to the [84] least, by his most wise
   and holy providence, to the end for the which they were Created;
   according unto his infallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable
   Councel of his [85] own will; to the praise of the glory of his wisdom,
   power, justice, infinite goodness and mercy.

   2. Although in relation to the foreknowledge and Decree of God, the
   first cause, all things come to pass [86] immutably and infallibly; so
   that there is not any thing, befalls any [87] by chance, or without his
   Providence; yet by the same Providence he ordereth them to fall out,
   according to the nature of second causes, either [88] necessarily,
   freely, or contingently.

   3. God in his ordinary Providence [89] maketh use of means; yet is free
   Hos. 1.7to work, without, [90] above, and [91] against them at his
   pleasure.

   4. The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of
   God, so far manifest themselves in his Providence, that his determinate
   Councel [92] extendeth it self even to the first fall, and all other
   sinful actions both of Angels, and Men; (and that not by a bare
   permission) which also he most wisely and powerfully [93] boundeth, and
   otherwise ordereth, and governeth, in a manifold dispensation to his
   most holy [94] ends: yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceedeth
   only from the Creatures, and not from God; who being most holy and
   righteous, neither is nor can be, the author or [95] approver of sin.

   5. The most wise, righteous, and gracious God, doth oftentimes, leave
   for a season his own children to manifold temptations, and the
   corruptions of their own heart, to chastise them for their former sins,
   or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption, and
   deceitfulness of their hearts, [96] that they may be humbled; and to
   raise them to a more close, and constant dependence for their support,
   upon himself; and to make them more watchful against all future
   occasions of sin, and for other just and holy ends.

   So that whatsoever befalls any of his elect is by his appointment, for
   his glory, [97] and their good.

   6. As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous judge,
   for former sin doth [98] blind and harden; from them he not only
   withholdeth his [99] Grace, whereby they might have been inlightned in
   their understanding, and wrought upon in their hearts: But sometimes
   also withdraweth [100] the gifts which they had, and exposeth them to
   such [101] objects as their corruptions makes occasion of sin; and
   withall [102] gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of
   the world, and the power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass, that they
   [103] harden themselves, even under those means which God useth for the
   softning of others.

   7. As the Providence of God doth in general reach to all Creatures, so
   after a most special manner it taketh care of his [104] Church, and
   disposeth of all things to the good thereof.

  CHAP. VI.

Of the fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment thereof.

   1. Although God created Man upright, and perfect, and gave him a
   righteous law, which had been unto life had he kept it,Gen. 2.16,17.and
   threatned death upon the breach thereof; yet he did not long abide in
   this honour; [105] Satan using the subtilty of the serpent to seduce
   Eve, then by her seducing Adam, who without any compulsion, did
   wilfully transgress the Law of their Creation, and the command given
   unto them, in eating the forbidden fruit; which God was pleased
   according to his wise and holy Councel to permit, having purposed to
   order it, to his own glory.

   2. Our first Parents by this Sin, fell from their [106] original
   righteousness and communion with God, and we in them, whereby death
   came upon all; [107] all becoming dead in Sin, and wholly defiled,
   [108] in all the faculties, and parts, of soul, and body.

   3. They being the [109] root, and by Gods appointment, standing in the
   room, and stead of all mankind; the guilt of the Sin was imputed, and
   corrupted nature conveyed, to all their posterity descending from them
   by ordinary generation, being now [110] conceived in Sin, and by nature
   children [111] of wrath, the servants of Sin, the subjects [112] of
   death and all other miseries, spiritual, temporal and eternal, unless
   the Lord Jesus [113] set them free.

   4. From this original corruption, whereby we are [114] utterly
   indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly
   inclined to all evil, do [115] proceed all actual transgressions.

   5. The corruption of nature, during this Life, doth [116] remain in
   those that are regenerated: and although it be through Christ pardoned,
   and mortified, yet both it self, and the first motions thereof, are
   truely and properly [117] Sin.

  CHAP. VII.

Of Gods Covenant.

   1. The distance between God and the Creature is so great, that although
   reasonable Creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet
   they could never have attained the reward of Life, but by some [118]
   voluntary condescension on Gods part, which he hath been pleased to
   express, by way of Covenant.

   2. Moreover Man having brought himself [119] under the curse of the Law
   by his fall, it pleased the Lord to make a Covenant of Grace wherein he
   freely offereth unto Sinners, [120] Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ,
   requiring of them Faith in him, that they may be saved; and [121]
   promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal Life,
   his holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe.

   3. This Covenant is revealed in the Gospel; first of all to Adam in the
   promise of Salvation by the [122] seed of the woman, and afterwards by
   farther steps, untill the full [123] discovery thereof was compleated
   in the new Testament; and it is founded in that [124] Eternal Covenant
   transaction, that was between the Father and the Son, about the
   Redemption of the Elect; and it is alone by the Grace of this Covenant,
   that all of the posterity of fallen Adam, that ever were [125] saved,
   did obtain life and a blessed immortality; Man being now utterly
   uncapable of acceptance with God upon those terms, on which Adam stood
   in his state of innocency.

  CHAP. VIII.

Of Christ the Mediator.

   1. It pleased God in his eternal purpose, to chuse and ordain the Lord
   Jesus his only begotten Son, according to the Covenant made between
   them both, [126] to be the Mediator between God and Man; the [127]
   Prophet, [128] Priest and [129] King; Head and Saviour of his Church,
   the heir of all things, and judge of the world: Unto whom he did from
   all Eternity [130] give a people to be his seed, and to be by him in
   time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.

   2. The Son of God, the second Person in the Holy Trinity, being very
   and eternal God, the brightness of the Fathers glory, of one substance
   and equal with him: who made the World, who upholdeth and governeth all
   things he hath made: did when the fullness of time was come take unto
   him [131] mans nature, with all the Essential properties, and common
   infirmities thereof, [132] yet without sin: being conceived by the Holy
   Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin Mary, the Holy Spirit coming down upon
   her, and the power of the most High overshadowing her, [133] and so was
   made of a Woman, of the Tribe of Judah, of the Seed of Abraham, and
   David according to the Scriptures: So that two whole, perfect, and
   distinct natures, were inseparably joined together in one Person:
   without conversion, composition, or confusion: which Person is very
   God, and very Man; yet one [134] Christ, the only Mediator between God
   and Man.

   3. The Lord Jesus in his humane nature thus united to the divine, in
   the Person of the Son, was sanctified, & anointed [135] with the Holy
   Spirit, above measure; having in him [136] all the treasures of wisdom
   and knowledge; in whom it pleased the Father that [137] all fullness
   should dwell: To the end that being [138] holy, harmless, undefiled,
   and full [139] of Grace, and Truth, he might be throughly furnished to
   execute the office of a [140] Surety; which office he took not upon
   himself, but was thereunto [141] called by his Father; who also put
   [142] all power and judgement in his hand, and gave him Commandement to
   execute the same.

   4. This office the Lord Jesus did most [143] willingly undertake, which
   that he might discharge he was made under the Law, [144] and did
   perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the [145] punishment due to us,
   which we should have born and suffered, being made [146] Sin and a
   Curse for us: enduring most grievous sorrows [147] in his Soul; and
   most painful sufferings in his body; was crucified, and died, and
   remained in the state of the dead; yet saw no [148] corruption: on the
   [149] third day he arose from the dead, with the same [150] body in
   which he suffered; with which he also [151] ascended into heaven: and
   there sitteth at the right hand of his Father, [152] making
   intercession; and shall [153] return to judge Men and Angels, at the
   end of the World.

   5. The Lord Jesus by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself,
   which he through the Eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, [154]
   hath fully satisfied the Justice of God, procured reconciliation, and
   purchased an Everlasting inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, [155]
   for all those whom the Father hath given unto him.

   6. Although the price of Redemption was not actually paid by Christ,
   till after his Incarnation, [156] yet the vertue, efficacy, and benefit
   thereof were communicated to the Elect in all ages successively, from
   the beginning of the World, in and by those Promises, Types, and
   Sacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and signified to be the Seed of
   the Woman, which should bruise the Serpents head; [157] and the Lamb
   slain from the foundation of the World: [158] Being the same yesterday,
   and to day, and for ever.

   7. Christ in the work of Mediation acteth according to both natures, by
   each nature doing that which is proper to it self; yet by reason of the
   Unity of the Person, that which is proper to one nature, is sometimes
   in Scripture attributed to the Person [159] denominated by the other
   nature.

   8. To all those for whom Christ hath obtained eternal redemption, he
   doth certainly, and effectually [160] apply, and communicate the same;
   making intercession for them, uniting them to himself by his spirit,
   [161] revealing unto them, in and by the word, the mystery of
   salvation; perswading them to believe, and obey; [162] governing their
   hearts by his word and spirit, and [163] overcoming all their enemies
   by his Almighty power, and wisdom; in such manner, and wayes as are
   most consonant to his wonderful, and [164] unsearchable dispensation;
   and all of free, and absolute Grace, without any condition foreseen in
   them, to procure it.

   9. This office of Mediator between God and Man, is proper [165] onely
   to Christ, who is the Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church of God;
   and may not be either in whole, or any part thereof transfer'd from him
   to any other.

   10. This number and order of Offices is necessary; for in respect of
   our [166] ignorance, we stand in need of his prophetical Office; and in
   respect of our alienation from God, [167] and imperfection of the best
   of our services, we need his Priestly office, to reconcile us, and
   present us acceptable unto God: and in respect o our averseness, and
   utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue, and security from
   our spiritual adversaries, we need his Kingly office, [168] to
   convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to his
   Heavenly Kingdome.

  CHAP. IX.

Of Free Will.

   1. God hath indued the Will of Man, with that natural liberty, and
   power of acting upon choice; that it is [169] neither forced, nor by
   any necessity of nature determined to do good or evil.

   2. Man in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power, to will, and
   to do that [170] which was good, and well-pleasing to God; but yet
   [171] was mutable, so that he might fall from it.

   3. Man by his fall into a state of sin hath wholly lost [172] all
   ability of Will, to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a
   natural man, being altogether averse from that good, [173] and dead in
   Sin, is not able, by his own strength, to [174] convert himself; or to
   prepare himself thereunto.

   4. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of
   Grace [175] he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin, and by
   his grace alone, enables him [176] freely to will, and to do that which
   is spiritually good; yet so as that by reason of his [177] remaining
   corruptions he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good; but
   doth also will that which is evil.

   5. The Will of Man is made [178] perfectly, and immutably free to good
   alone, in the state of Glory only.

  CHAP. X.

Of Effectual Calling.

   1. Those whom God hath predestinated unto Life, he is pleased in his
   appointed, and accepted time, [179] effectually to call by his word,
   and Spirit, out of that state of sin, and death, in which they are by
   nature, to grace and Salvation [180] by Jesus Christ; inlightning their
   minds, spiritually, and savingly to [181] understand the things of God;
   taking away their [182] heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart
   of flesh; renewing their wills, and by his Almighty power determining
   them [183] to that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus
   Christ; yet so as they come [184] most freely, being made willing by
   his Grace.

   2. This Effectual Call is of God's free, and special grace alone, [185]
   not from any thing at all foreseen in man, nor from any power, or
   agency in the Creature, coworking with his special Grace, [186] the
   Creature being wholly passive therein, being dead in sins and
   trespasses, until being quickned & renewed by the holy Spirit, he is
   thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the Grace offered
   and conveyed in it; and that by no less [187] power, then that which
   raised up Christ from the dead.

   3. Elect Infants dying in infancy, are [188] regenerated and saved by
   Christ through the Spirit; who worketh when, and where, and [189] how
   he pleaseth: so also are all other elect persons, who are uncapable of
   being outwardly called by the Ministry of the Word.

   4. Others not elected, although they may be called by the Ministry of
   the word, [190] and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet
   not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither will, nor can
   truly [191] come to Christ; and therefore cannot be saved: much less
   can men that receive not the Christian Religion [192] be saved; be they
   never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of
   nature, and the Law of that Religion they do profess.

Of Justification.

   1. Those whom God Effectually calleth, he also freely [193] justifieth,
   not by infusing Righteousness into them, but by [194] pardoning their
   sins, and by accounting, and accepting their Persons as [195]
   Righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for
   Christ's sake alone, not by imputing faith it self, the act of
   beleiving, or any other [196] evangelical obedience to them, as their
   Righteousness; but by imputing Christs active obedience unto the whole
   Law, and passive obedience in his death, for their whole and sole
   Righteousnnss, they [197] receiving, and resting on him, and his
   Righteousness, by Faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is
   the gift of God.

   2. Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ, and his Righteousness,
   is the [198] alone instrument of Justification: yet it is not alone in
   the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving
   Graces, and is no dead faith, [199] but worketh by love.

   3. Christ by his obedience, and death, did fully discharge the debt of
   all ; and did by the sacrifice of himself, in the blood of his cross,
   undergoing in their stead, the penalty due unto them: make a proper,
   real and full satisfaction [200] to Gods justice in their behalf: yet
   in asmuch as he was given by the Father for them, and his Obedience and
   Satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both [201] freely, not for
   any thing in them; their Justification is only of Free Grace, that both
   the exact justice and rich Grace of God, might be [202] glorified in
   the Justification of sinners.

   4. God did from all eternity decree to [203] justifie all the Elect,
   and Christ did in the fulness of time die for their sins, and rise
   [204] again for their Justification; Nevertheless they are not
   justified personally, untill the Holy Spirit, doth in due time [205]
   actually apply Christ unto them.

   5. God doth continue to [206] Forgive the sins of , and although they
   can never fall from the state of [207] justication; yet they may by
   their sins fall under Gods [208] Fatherly displeasure; and in that
   condition, they have not usually the light of his Countenance restored
   unto them, untill they [209] humble themselves, confess their sins, beg
   pardon, and renew their faith, and repentance.

   6. The Justification of Believers under the Old Testament was in all
   these respects, [210] one and the same with the justification of
   Believers under the New Tement.

Of Adoption.

   1. All those that are justified, God [2]vouchsafed, in, and for the
   sake of his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the Grace [211]
   of Adoption; by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the

  CHAP. XIII.

Of Sanctification.

   1. They who are united to Christ, Effectually called, and regenerated,
   having a new heart, and a new Spirit created in them, through the
   vertue of Christ's death, and Resurrection; are also [223] farther
   sanctified, really, and personally, through the same vertue, [224] by
   his word and Spirit dwelling in them; [225] the dominion of the whole
   body of sin is destroyed, [226] and the several lusts thereof, are more
   and more weakned, and mortified; and they more and more quickened, and
   [227] strengthned in all saving graces, to the [228] practice of all
   true holyness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

   2. This Sanctification is [229] throughout, in the whole man, yet
   imperfect [230] in this life; there abideth still some remnants of
   corruption in every part, whence ariseth a [231] continual, and
   irreconcilable war; the Flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the
   Spirit against the Flesh.

   3. In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much
   [232] prevail; yet through the continual supply of strength from the
   sanctifying Spirit of Christ the [233] regenerate part doth overcome;
   and so the Saints grow in Grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of
   God, [234] pressing after an heavenly life, in Evangelical Obedience to
   all the commands which Christ as Head and King, in his Word hath
   prescribed to them.

  CHAP. XIV.

Of Saving Faith.

   1. The Grace of Faith, whereby the Elect are enabled to beleive to the
   saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ [235] in
   their hearts; and is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the [236]
   Word; by which also, and by the administration of Baptisme, and the
   Lords Supper, Prayer and other Means appointed of God, it is increased,
   [237] and strengthned.

   2. By this Faith, a Christian believeth to be true, [238] whatsoever is
   revealed in the Word, for the Authority of God himself; and also
   apprehendeth an excellency therein, [239] above all other Writings; and
   all things in the world: as it bears forth the Glory of God in his
   Attributes, the excellency of Christ in his Nature and Offices; and the
   Power and Fullness of the Holy Spirit in his Workings, and Operations;
   and so is enabled to [240] cast his Soul upon the truth thus beleived;
   and also acteth differently, upon that which each particular, passage
   thereof containeth; yeilding obedience to the [241] commands, trembling
   at the [242] threatnings, and embracing the [243] promises of God, for
   this life, and that which is to come: But the principal acts of Saving
   Faith, have immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, and
   resting upon [244] him alone, for Justification, Sanctification, and
   Eternal Life, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace.

   3. This Faith although it be different in degrees, and may be weak,
   [245] or strong; yet it is in the least degree of it, different in the
   kind, or nature of it (as is all other saving Grace) from the Faith,
   [246] and common grace of temporary beleivers; and therefore though it
   may be many times assailed, and weakned; yet it gets [247] the victory;
   growing up in many, to the attainment of a full [248] assurance through
   Christ, who is both the Author [249] and finisher of our Faith.

  CHAP. XV.

Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation.

   1. Such of the Elect as are converted at riper years, having [250]
   sometimes lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers lusts
   and pleasures, God in their Effectual Calling giveth them Repentance
   unto Life.

   2. Whereas there is none that doth good, and sinneth [251] not; and the
   best of men may through the power, and deceitfulness of their
   corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall
   into great sins, and provocations; God hath in the Covenant of Grace,
   mercifully provided that Beleivers so sinning, and falling, [252] be
   renewed through Repentance unto Salvation.

   3. This saving Repentance is an [253] evangelical Grace, whereby a
   person being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of
   his sin, doth, by Faith in Christ, humble himself for it, with godly
   sorrow, detestation of it, and self abhorrency; [254] praying for
   pardon, and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavour by supplies
   of the Spirit, to [255] walk before God unto all well pleasing in all
   things.

   4. As Repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our
   lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof;
   so it is every mans duty, to repent of his [256] particular known sins,
   particularly.

   5. Such is the provision which God hath made through Christ in the
   Covenant of Grace, for the preservation of Believers unto Salvation,
   that although there is no sin so small, but it deserves [257]
   damnation; yet there is no sin so great, that it shall bring damnation
   on them that [258] repent; which makes the constant preaching of
   Repentance necessary.

  CHAP. XVI.

Of Good Works.

   1. Good Works are only such as God hath [259] commanded in his Holy
   word; and not such as without the warrant thereof, are devised by men,
   out of blind zeal, [260] or upon any pretence of good intentions.

   2. These good works, done in obedience to Gods commandments, are the
   fruits, and evidences [261] of a true, and lively faith; and by them
   Believers manifest their [262] thankfullness, strengthen their [263]
   assurance, edifie their [264] brethren, adorn the profession of the
   Gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries and glorifie [265] God whose
   workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus [266] thereunto, that
   having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end [267] eternal
   life.

   3. Their ability to do good works, is not at all of themselves; but
   wholly from the Spirit [268] of Christ; and that they may be enabled
   thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is
   necessary an [269] actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in
   them to will, and to do, of his good pleasure; yet are they not
   hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any
   duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be
   diligent in [270] stirring up the Grace of God that is in them.

   4. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is
   possible in this life, are so far from being able to [3]superrogate,
   and to do more then God requires, as that [271] they fall short of much
   which in duty they are bound to do.

   5. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of Sin or Eternal Life at
   the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between
   them and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is between
   us and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor satisfie for the
   debt of our [272] former sins; but when we have done all we can, we
   have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants; and because as
   they are good they proceed from his [273] Spirit, and as they are
   wrought by us they are defiled [274] and mixed with so much weakness
   and imperfection that they cannot endure the severity of Gods
   judgement.

   6. Yet notwithstanding the persons of Believers being accepted through
   Christ their good works also are accepted in [275] him; not as though
   they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreprovable in Gods
   sight; but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleased to accept
   and reward that which is [276] sincere although accompanied with many
   weaknesses and imperfections.

   7. Works done by unregenerate men although for the matter of them they
   may be things which God commands, and of good use, both to themselves
   and [277] others; yet because they proceed not from a heart purified by
   [278] faith, nor are done in a right manner according to the [279]
   word, nor to a right end the [280] glory of God; they are therefore
   sinful and cannot please God; nor make a man meet to receive grace from
   [281] God; and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and [282]
   displeasing to God.

  CHAP. XVII.

Of Perseverance of the Saints.

   1. Those whom God hath accepted in the beloved, effectually called and
   Sanctified by his Spirit, and given the precious faith of his Elect
   unto, can neither totally nor finally fall from the state of grace;
   [283] but shall certainly persevere therein to the end and be eternally
   saved, seeing the gifts and callings of God are without Repentance,
   (whence he still begets and nourisheth in them Faith, Repentance, Love,
   Joy, Hope, and all the graces of the Spirit unto immortality) and
   though many storms and floods arise and beat against them, yet they
   shall never be able to take them off that foundation and rock which by
   faith they are fastned upon: notwithstanding through unbelief and the
   temptations of Satan the sensible sight of the light and love of God,
   may for a time be clouded, and obscured from [284] them, yet he is
   still the same [285] and they shall be sure to be kept by the power of
   God unto Salvation, where they shall enjoy their purchased possession,
   they being engraven upon the palm of his hands, and their names having
   been written in the book of life from all Eternity.

   2. This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free
   will; but upon the immutability of the decree of [286] Election flowing
   from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father; upon the
   efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ [287] and Union
   with him, the [288] oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit & the [289]
   seed of God within them, and the nature of the [290] Covenant of Grace
   from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof.

   3. And though they may through the temptation of Satan and of the
   world, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect
   of means of their preservation fall into grievous [291] sins, and for a
   time continue therein; whereby they incur [292] Gods displeasure, and
   grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and [293] comforts
   impaired have their hearts hardened, and their Consciences wounded,
   [294] hurt, and scandalize others, and bring temporal judgements [295]
   upon themselves: yet they shall renew their [296] repentance and be
   preserved through faith in Christ Jesus to the end.

  CHAP. XVIII.

Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation.

   1. Although temporary Believers, and other unregenerate men, may vainly
   deceive themselves with false hopes, and carnal presumptions, of being
   in the favour of God, and state of salvation, [297] which hope of
   theirs shall perish; yet such as truely believe in the Lord Jesus, and
   love him in sincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good Conscience
   before him, may in this life be certainly assured [298] that they are
   in the state of Grace; and may rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God
   which hope shall never make them [299] ashamed.

   2. This certainty is not a bare conjectural, and probable perswasion,
   grounded upon [300] a fallible hope; but an infallible assurance of
   faith founded on the Blood and Righteousness of Christ [301] revealed
   in the Gospel; and also upon the inward [302] evidence of those graces
   of the Spirit unto which promises are made, and on the testimony of the
   [303] Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our Spirits that we are the
   children of God; and as a fruit thereof keeping the heart both [304]
   humble and holy.

   3. This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of
   faith, but that a true Believer, may wait long and conflict with many
   difficulties before he be [305] partaker of it; yet being enabled by
   the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may
   without extraordinary revelation in the right use of means [306] attain
   thereunto: and therefore it is the duty of every one, to give all
   diligence to make their Calling and Election sure, that thereby his
   heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Spirit, in love and
   thankfulness to God, and in strength and chearfulness in the duties of
   obedience, the proper [307] fruits of this Assurance; so far is it
   [308] from inclining men to looseness.

   4. True Believers may have the assurance of their Salvation divers ways
   shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as [309] by negligence in
   preserving of it, by [310] falling into som special Sin, which woundeth
   the Conscience, and grieveth the Spirit, by some sudden or [311]
   vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the [312] light of his
   countenance and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and
   to have no light; yet are they never destitute of the [313] seed of
   God, and Life [314] of Faith, that Love of Christ, and the brethren,
   that sincerity of Heart, and Conscience of duty, out of which by the
   operation of the Spirit, this Assurance may in due time be [315]
   revived: and by the which in the mean time they are [316] preserved
   from utter despair.

  CHAP. XIX.

Of the Law of God.

   1. God gave to Adam a Law of universal obedience, [317] written in his
   Heart, and a particular precept of not eating the Fruit of the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil; by which he bound him, and all his
   posterity to personal entire exact and perpetual [318] obedience;
   promised life upon the fulfilling, and [319] threatned death upon the
   breach of it; and indued him with power and ability to keep it.

   2. The same Law that was first written in the heart of man, [320]
   continued to be a perfect rule of Righteousness after the fall; & was
   delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in [321] Ten Commandments and
   written in two Tables; the four first containing our duty towards God,
   and the other six our duty to man.

   3. Besides this Law commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to
   the people of Israel Ceremonial Laws, containing several typical
   ordinances, partly of worship, [322] prefiguring Christ, his graces,
   actions, sufferings, and benefits; and partly holding forth divers
   instructions [323] of moral duties, all which Ceremonial Laws being
   appointed only to the time of reformation, are by Jesus Christ the true
   Messiah and only Law-giver who was furnished with power from the
   Father, for that end, [324] abrogated and taken away.

   4. To them also he gave sundry judicial Laws, which expired together
   with the state of that people, not obliging any now by vertue of that
   institution; their general [325] equity onely, being of moral use.

   5. The moral Law doth for ever bind all, [326] as well justified
   persons as others, to the obedience thereof, and that not only in
   regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the [327]
   authority of God the Creator; who gave it: Neither doth Christ in the
   Gospel any way dissolve, [328] but much strengthen this obligation.

   6. Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of
   Works, [329] to be thereby Justified or condemned; yet it is of great
   use to them as well as to others: in that, as a Rule of Life, informing
   them of the Will of God, and their Duty, it directs and binds them, to
   walk accordingly; [330] discovering also the sinfull pollutions of
   their Natures, Hearts and Lives; so as Examining themselves thereby,
   they may come to further Conviction of, Humiliation for, and Hatred
   against Sin; together with a clearer sight of the need they have of
   Christ and the perfection of his Obedience: It is likewise of use to
   the Regenerate to restrain their Corruptions, in that it forbids Sin;
   and the Threatnings of it serve to shew what even their Sins deserve;
   and what afflictions in this Life they may expect for them, although
   free'd from the Curse and unallayed Rigor thereof. The Promises of it
   likewise shew them Gods approbation of Obedience, and what blessings
   they may expect upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them
   by the Law as a Covenant of Works; so as mans doing Good and refraining
   from Evil, because the Law incourageth to the one and deterreth from
   the other, is no Evidence of his being [331] under the Law and not
   under Grace.

   7. Neither are the forementioned uses of the Law [332] contrary to the
   Grace of the Gospel; but do sweetly comply with it; the Spirit of
   Christ subduing [333] and inabling the Will of man, to do that freely
   and chearfully, which the will of God revealed in the Law, requireth to
   be done.

  CHAP. XX.

Of the Gospel, and of the extent of the Grace thereof.

   1. The Covenant of Works being broken by Sin, and made unprofitable
   unto Life; God was pleased to give forth the promise of Christ, [334]
   the Seed of the Woman, as the means of calling the Elect, and begetting
   in them Faith and Repentance; in this Promise, the [335] Gospel, as to
   the substance of it, was revealed, and therein Effectual, for the
   Conversion and Salvation of Sinners.

   2. This Promise of Christ, and Salvation by him, is revealed only by
   [336] the Word of God; neither do the Works of Creation, or Providence,
   with the light of Nature, [337] make discovery of Christ, or of Grace
   by him; so much as in a general, or obscure way; much less that men
   destitute of the Revelation of him by the Promise, or Gospel; [338]
   should be enabled thereby, to attain saving Faith, or Repentance.

   3. The Revelation of the Gospel unto Sinners, made in divers times, and
   by sundry parts; with the addition of Promises, and Precepts for the
   Obedience required therein, as to the Nations, and Persons, to whom it
   is granted, is meerly of the [339] Soveraign Will and good Pleasure of
   God; not being annexed by vertue of any Promise, to the due improvement
   of mens natural abilities, by vertue of Common light received, without
   it; which none ever did [340] make, or can so do: And therefore in all
   Ages the preaching of the Gospel hath been granted unto persons and
   Nations, as to the extent, or streightning of it, in great variety,
   according to the Councell of the Will of God.

   4. Although the Gospel be the only outward means, of revealing Christ,
   and saving Grace; and is, as such, abundantly sufficient thereunto; yet
   that men who are dead in Trespasses, may be born again, Quickned or
   Regenerated; there is moreover necessary, an effectual, [4]insuperable
   [341] work of the Holy Spirit, upon the whole Soul, for the producing
   in them a new spiritual Life; without which no other means will effect
   [342] their Conversion unto God.

  CHAP. XXI.

Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience.

   1. The Liberty which Christ hath purchased for Believers under the
   Gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of Sin, the condemning
   wrath of God, the Rigour and [343] Curse of the Law; and in their being
   delivered from this present evil [344] World, Bondage to [345] Satan,
   and Dominion [346] of Sin; from the [347] Evil of Afflictions; the
   Fear, and Sting [348] of Death, the Victory of the Grave, and [349]
   Everlasting Damnation; as also in their [350] free access to God; and
   their yielding Obedience unto him not out of a slavish fear, [351] but
   a Child-like love, and willing mind.

   All which were common also to Believers under the Law [352] for the
   substance of them; but under the new Testament, the Liberty of
   Christians is further enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the
   Ceremonial Law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected; and in
   greater boldness of access to the Throne of Grace; and in fuller
   Communications of the [353] Free Spirit of God, then Believers under
   the Law did ordinarily partake of.

   2. God alone is [354] Lord of the Conscience, and hath left it free
   from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, [355] which are in any
   thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it. So that to Believe
   such Doctrines, or obey such Commands out of Conscience, [356] is to
   betray true liberty of Conscience; and the requiring of an [357]
   implicit Faith, and absolute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty
   of Conscience, and Reason also.

   3. They who upon pretence of Christian Liberty do practice any sin, or
   cherish any sinfull lust; as they do thereby pervert the main design of
   the Grace of the Gospel, [358] to their own Destruction; so they wholy
   destroy [359] the end of Christian Liberty, which is, that being
   delivered out of the hands of all our Enemies we might serve the Lord
   without fear in Holiness, and Righteousness before him, all the days of
   our Life.

  CHAP. XXII.

Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day.

   1. The light of Nature shews that there is a God, who hath Lordship,
   and Soveraigntye over all; is just, good, and doth good unto all; and
   is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and
   served, with all the Heart, and all the Soul, [360] and with all the
   Might. But the acceptable way of Worshipping the true God, is [361]
   instituted by himself; and so limited by his own revealed will, that he
   may not be Worshipped according to the imaginations, and devices of
   Men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations, or
   [362] any other way, not prescribed in the Holy Scriptures.

   2. Religious Worship is to be given to God the Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, and to him [363] alone; not to Angels, Saints, or any other
   [364] Creatures; and since the fall, not without a [365] Mediator, nor
   in the Mediation of any other but [366] Christ alone.

   3. Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special part of natural worship,
   is by God required of [367] all men. But that it may be accepted, it is
   to be made in the [368] Name of the Son, by the help [369] of the
   Spirit, according to [370] his Will; with understanding, reverence,
   humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance; and when with
   others, in a [371] known tongue.

   4. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men
   living, [372] or that shall live hereafter; but not [373] for the dead,
   nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned [374] the
   sin unto death.

   5. The [375] reading of the Scriptures, Preaching, and [376] hearing
   the word of God, teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms, Hymns
   and Spiritual songs, singing with grace in our Hearts to [377] the
   Lord; as also the Administration [378] of Baptism, and [379] the Lords
   Supper are all parts of Religious worship of God, to be performed in
   obedience to him, with understanding, faith, reverence, and godly fear;
   moreover solemn humiliation [380] with fastings; and thanksgiving upon
   [381] special occasions, ought to be used in an holy and religious
   manner.

   6. Neither Prayer, nor any other part of Religious worship, is now
   under the Gospel tied unto, or made more acceptable by, any place in
   which it is [382] performed, or towards which it is directed; but God
   is to be worshipped every where in Spirit, and in truth; as in [383]
   private families [384] daily, and [385] in secret each one by himself,
   so more solemnly in the publick Assemblies, which are not carelessely,
   nor wilfuly, to be [386] neglected, or forsaken, when God by his word,
   or providence calleth thereunto.

   7. As it is of the Law of nature, that in general a proportion of time
   by Gods appointment, be set a part for the Worship of God; so by his
   Word in a positive-moral, and perpetual Commandement, binding all men,
   in all Ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a
   [387] Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the
   World to the Resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and
   from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the
   week [388] which is called the Lords day; and is to be continued to the
   end of the World, as the Christian Sabbath; the observation of the last
   day of the week being abolished.

   8. The Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due
   preparing of their hearts, and ordering their common affairs aforehand,
   do not only observe an holy [389] rest all the day, from their own
   works, words, and thoughts, about their worldly employment, and
   recreations, but also are taken up the whole time in the publick and
   private exercises of his worship, and in the duties [390] of necessity
   and mercy.

  CHAP. XXIII.

Of Lawful Oaths and Vows.

   1. A lawful [5]Oath is a part of religious worship, [391] wherein the
   person swearing in Truth, Righteousness, and Judgement, solemnly
   calleth God to witness what he sweareth; [392] and to judge him
   according to the Truth or falseness thereof.

   2. The Name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and
   therein it is to be used, with all Holy Fear and reverence, therefore
   to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious, and dreadful name; or to
   swear at all by any other thing, is sinful and to be [393] abhorred;
   yet as in matter of weight and moment for confirmation of truth, [394]
   and ending all strife, an Oath is warranted by the Word of God; so a
   lawful Oath being imposed, [395] by lawful Authority, in such matters,
   ought to be taken.

   3. Whosoever taketh an Oath warranted by the Word of God, ought duely
   to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act; and therein to
   [6]avouch nothing, but what he knoweth to be the truth; for that by
   rash, false, and vain Oaths the [396] Lord is provoked, and for them
   this Land mournes.

   4. An Oath is to be taken in the plain, and [397] common sense of the
   words; without equivocation, or mental reservation.

   5. A [7]Vow which is not to be made to any Creature, but to God alone,
   [398] is to be made and performed with all Religious care, and
   faithfulness: But Popish Monastical Vows, [399] of perpetual single
   life, professed [400] poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from
   being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious, [401]
   and sinful snares, in which no Christian may intangle himself.

Of the Civil Magistrate.

   1. God the supream Lord, and King of all the World, hath ordained Civil
   [402] Magistrates to be under him, over the people for his own glory,
   and the publick good; and to this end hath armed them with the power of
   the Sword, for defence and encouragement of them that do good, and for
   the punishment of evil doers.

   2. It is lawful for Christians to Accept, and Execute the Office of a
   Magistrate when called thereunto; in the management whereof, as they
   ought especially to maintain [403] Justice, and Peace, according to the
   wholsome Laws of each Kingdome, and Commonwealth: so for that end they
   may lawfully now under the New Testament [404] wage war upon just and
   necessary occasions.

   3. Civil Magistrates being set up by God, for the ends aforesaid;
   subjection in all lawful things commanded by them, ought to be yeilded
   by us, in the Lord; not only for wrath [405] but for Conscience sake;
   and we ought to make supplications and prayers for Kings, and all that
   are in Authority, [406] that under them we may live a quiet and
   peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.

Of Marriage.

   1. Marriage is to be between one Man and one Woman; [407] neither is it
   lawful for any man to have more then one Wife, nor for any Woman to
   have more then one Husband at the same time.

   2. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help [408] of Husband and Wife,
   [409] for the increase of Man-kind, with a legitimate issue, and for
   [410] preventing of uncleanness.

   3. It is lawful for [411] all sorts of people to Marry, who are able
   with judgment to give their consent; yet it is the duty of Christians
   [412] to marry in the Lord, and therefore such as profess the true
   Religion, should not Marry with Infidels, [413] or Idolaters; neither
   should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as
   are wicked, in their life, or maintain damnable Heresie.

   4. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of [8]consanguinity,
   [414] or [9]Affinity forbidden in the word; nor can such incestuous
   Marriage ever be made lawful, by any law of Man or consent of parties,
   [415] so as those persons may live together as Man and Wife.

  CHAP. XXVI.

Of the Church.

   1. The Catholick or universal Church, which (with respect to the
   internal work of the Spirit, and truth of grace) may be called
   invisible, consists of the whole [416] number of the Elect, that have
   been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the head
   thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of him that filleth
   all in all.

   2. All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the
   Gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ, according unto it; not
   destroying their own profession by any Errors everting the foundation,
   or unholyness of [10]conversation, [417] are and may be called visible
   Saints; [418] and of such ought all particular Congregations to be
   constituted.

   3. The purest Churches under heaven are subject [419] to mixture, and
   error; and som have so degenerated as to become [420] no Churches of
   Christ, but Synagogues of Satan; nevertheless Christ always hath had,
   and ever shall have a [421] Kingdome in this world, to the end thereof,
   of such as believe in him, and make profession of his Name.

   4. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, in whom by the
   appointment of the Father, [422] all power for the calling,
   institution, order, or Government of the Church, is invested in a
   supream & soveraigne manner, neither can the Pope of Rome in any sense
   be head thereof, but is [423] that Antichrist, that Man of sin, and Son
   of perdition, that exalteth himself in the Church against Christ, and
   all that is called God; whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness
   of his coming. [424]

   5. In the execution of this power wherewith he is so intrusted, the
   Lord Jesus calleth out of the World unto himself, through the Ministry
   of his word, by his Spirit, [425] those that are given unto him by his
   Father; that they may walk before him in all the [426] ways of
   obedience, which he prescribeth to them in his Word. Those thus called
   he commandeth to walk together in particular societies, or [427]
   Churches, for their mutual edification; and the due performance of that
   publick worship, which he requireth of them in the World.

   6. The Members of these Churches are [428] Saints by calling, visibly
   manifesting and evidencing (in and by their profession and walking)
   their obedience unto that call of Christ; and do willingly consent to
   walk together according to the appointment of Christ, giving up
   themselves, to the Lord & one to another by the will of God, [429] in
   professed subjection to the Ordinances of the Gospel.

   7. To each of these Churches thus gathered, according to his mind,
   declared in his word, he hath given all that [430] power and authority,
   which is any way needfull, for their carrying on that order in worship,
   and discipline, which he hath instituted for them to observe; with
   commands, and rules, for the due and right exerting, and executing of
   that power.

   8. A particular Church gathered, and compleatly Organized, according to
   the mind of Christ, consists of Officers, and Members; And the Officers
   appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the Church (so called
   and gathered) for the peculiar Administration of Ordinances, and
   Execution of Power, or Duty, which he intrusts them with, or calls them
   to, to be continued to the end of the World are [431] Bishops or Elders
   and Deacons.

   9. The way appointed by Christ for the Calling of any person, fitted,
   and gifted by the Holy Spirit, unto the Office of Bishop, or Elder, in
   a Church, is, that he be chosen thereunto by the common [432] suffrage
   of the Church it self; and Solemnly set apart by Fasting and Prayer,
   with imposition of hands of the [433] Eldership of the Church, if there
   be any before Constituted therein; And of a Deacon [434] that he be
   chosen by the like suffrage, and set apart by Prayer, and the like
   Imposition of hands.

   10. The work of Pastors being constantly to attend the Service of
   Christ, in his Churches, in the Ministry of the Word, and Prayer, [435]
   with watching for their Souls, as they that must give an account to
   him; it is incumbent on the Churches to whom they Minister, not only to
   give them all due respect, [436] but also to communicate to them of all
   their good things according to their ability, so as they may have a
   comfortable supply, without being themselves [437] entangled in Secular
   Affairs; and may also be capable of exercising [438] Hospitality toward
   others; and this is required by the [439] Law of Nature, and by the
   Express order of our Lord Jesus, who hath ordained that they that
   preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.

   11. Although it be incumbent on the Bishops or Pastors of the Churches
   to be instant in Preaching the Word, by way of Office; yet the work of
   Preaching the Word, is not so peculiarly confined to them; but that
   others also [440] gifted, and fitted by the Holy Spirit for it, and
   approved, and called by the Church, may and ought to perform it.

   12. As all Believers are bound to joyn themselves to particular
   Churches, when and where they have opportunity so to do; So all that
   are admitted unto the priviledges of a Church, are also [441] under the
   Censures and Government thereof, according to the Rule of Christ.

   13. No Church-members upon any offence taken by them, having performed
   their Duty required of them towards the person they are offended at,
   ought to disturb any Church order, or absent themselves from the
   Assemblies of the Church, or Administration of any Ordinances, upon the
   account of such offence at any of their fellow-members; but to wait
   upon Christ, [442] in the further proceeding of the Church.

   14. As each Church, and all the Members of it are bound to [443] pray
   continually, for the good and prosperity of all the Churches of Christ,
   in all places; and upon all occasions to further it (every one within
   the bounds of their places, and callings, in the Exercise of their
   Gifts and Graces) so the Churches (when planted by the providence of
   God so as they may injoy opportunity and advantage for it) ought to
   hold [444] communion amongst themselves for their peace, increase of
   love, and mutual edification.

   15. In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of
   Doctrine, or Administration; wherein either the Churches in general are
   concerned, or any one Church in their peace, union, and edification; or
   any member, or members, of any Church are injured, in or by any
   proceedings in censures not agreeable to truth, and order: it is
   according to the mind of Christ, that many Churches holding communion
   together, do by their messengers meet to consider, [445] and give their
   advice, in or about that matter in difference, to be reported to all
   the Churches concerned; howbeit these messengers assembled are not
   entrusted with any Church-power properly so called; or with any
   jurisdiction over the Churches themselves, to exercise any censures
   either over any Churches, or Persons: or [446] to impose their
   determination on the Churches, or Officers.

  CHAP. XXVII.

Of the Communion of Saints.

   1. All Saints that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by his
   Spirit, and Faith; although they are not made thereby one person with
   him, have [447] fellowship in his Graces, sufferings, death,
   resurrection, and glory; and being united to one another in love, they
   [448] have communion in each others gifts, and graces; and are obliged
   to the performance of such duties, publick and private, in an orderly
   way, [449] as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and
   outward man.

   2. Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and
   communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual
   services, [450] as tend to their mutual edification; as also in
   relieving each other in [451] outward things according to their several
   abilities, and necessities; which communion according to the rule of
   the Gospel, though especially to be exercised by them, in the relations
   wherein they stand, whether in [452] families, or [453] Churches; yet
   as God offereth opportunity is to be extended to all the houshold of
   faith, even all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord
   Jesus; nevertheless their communion one with another as Saints, doth
   not take away or [454] infringe, the title or propriety, which each man
   hath in his goods and possessions.

Of Baptism and the Lords Supper.

   1. Baptism and the Lords Supper are ordinances of positive, and
   soveraign institution; appointed by the Lord Jesus the only Law-giver,
   to be continued in his Church [455] to the end of the world.

   2. These holy appointments are to be administred by those only, who are
   qualified and thereunto called according [456] to the commission of
   Christ.

  CHAP. XXIX.

Of Baptism.

   1. Baptism is an Ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus
   Christ, to be unto the party Baptized, a sign of his fellowship with
   him, in his death, [457] and resurrection; of his being engrafted into
   him; of [458] remission of sins; and of his [459] giving up unto God
   through Jesus Christ to live and walk in newness of Life.

   2. Those who do actually professe [460] repentance towards God, faith
   in, and obedience, to our Lord Jesus, are the only proper subjects of
   this ordinance.

   3. The outward element to be used in this ordinance [461] is water,
   wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of
   the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

   4. Immersion, or dipping of the person [462] in water, is necessary to
   the due administration of this ordinance.

  CHAP. XXX.

Of the Lords Supper.

   1. The Supper of the Lord Jesus, was instituted by him, the same night
   wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his Churches unto the end of
   the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and shewing forth the
   sacrifice of himself in his death [463] confirmation of the faith of
   believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and
   growth in him, their further ingagement in, and to, all duties which
   they owe unto him; [464] and to be a bond and pledge of their communion
   with him, and with each other.

   2. In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any
   real sacrifice made at all, for remission of sin of the quick or dead;
   but only a memorial of that [465] one offering up of himself, by
   himself, upon the crosse, once for all; and a spiritual oblation of all
   [466] possible praise unto God for the same; so that the Popish
   sacrifice of the Mass (as they call it) is most abominable, injurious
   to Christs own only sacrifice, the alone [11]propitiation for all the
   sins of the Elect.

   3. The Lord Jesus hath in this Ordinance, appointed his Ministers to
   Pray, and bless the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to set them
   apart from a common to an holy use, and to take and break the Bread; to
   take the Cup, [467] and (they communicating also themselves) to give
   both to the Communicants.

   4. The denyal of the Cup to the people, worshiping the Elements, the
   lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving
   them for any pretended religious use, [468] are all contrary to the
   nature of this Ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.

   5. The outward Elements in this Ordinance, duely set apart to the uses
   ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that
   truely, although in terms used figuratively, they are sometimes called
   by the name of the things they represent, to wit the [469] body and
   Blood of Christ; albeit in substance, and nature, they still remain
   truly, and only [470] Bread, and Wine, as they were before.

   6. That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of Bread and
   Wine, into the substance of Christs body and blood (commonly called
   Transubstantiation) by consecration of a Priest, or by any other way,
   is repugnant not to Scripture [471] alone, but even to common sense and
   reason; overthroweth the [472] nature of the ordinance, and hath been
   and is the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross Idolatries.

   7. Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible Elements in
   this Ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet
   not carnally, and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon
   Christ crucified [473] & all the benefits of his death: the Body and
   Blood of Christ, being then not corporally, or carnally, but
   spiritually present to the faith of Believers, in that Ordinance, as
   the Elements themselves are to their outward senses.

   8. All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy
   communion [474] with Christ; so are they unworthy of the Lords Table;
   and cannot without great sin against him, while they remain such,
   partake of these holy mysteries, [475] or be admitted thereunto: yea
   whosoever shall receive unworthily are guilty of the Body and Blood of
   the Lord, eating and drinking judgement to themselves.

  CHAP. XXXI.

Of the State of Man after Death and of the Resurrection of the Dead.

   1. The Bodies of Men after Death return to dust, [476] and see
   corruption; but their Souls (which neither die nor sleep) having an
   immortal subsistence, immediately [477] return to God who gave them:
   the Souls of the Righteous being then made perfect in holyness, are
   received into paradise where they are with Christ, and behold the face
   of God, in light [478] and glory; waiting for the full Redemption of
   their Bodies; and the souls of the wicked, are cast into hell; where
   they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to [479] the
   judgement of the great day; besides these two places for Souls
   separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.

   2. At the last day such of the Saints as are found alive shall not
   sleep but be [480] changed; and all the dead shall be raised up with
   the self same bodies, and [481] none other; although with different
   [482] qualities, which shall be united again to their Souls for ever.

   3. The bodies of the unjust shall by the power of Christ, be raised to
   dishonour; the bodies of the just by his spirit unto honour, [483] and
   be made conformable to his own glorious Body.

  CHAP. XXXII.

Of the Last Judgement.

   1. God hath appointed a Day wherein he will judge the world in
   Righteousness, by [484] Jesus Christ; to whom all power and judgement
   is given of the Father; in which Day not only the [485] Apostate Angels
   shall be judged; but likewise all persons that have lived upon the
   Earth, shall appear before the Tribunal of Christ; [486] to give an
   account of their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, and to receive according
   to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.

   2. The end of Gods appointing this Day, is for the manifestation of the
   glory of his Mercy, in the Eternal Salvation of the Elect; [487] and of
   his Justice in the Eternal damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked
   and disobedient; for then shall the Righteous go into Everlasting Life,
   and receive that fulness of Joy, and Glory, with everlasting reward, in
   the presence [488] of the Lord: but the wicked who know not God, and
   obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into Eternal
   torments, and [489] punished with everlasting destruction, from the
   presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.

   3. As Christ would have us to be certainly perswaded that there shall
   be a Day of judgement, both [490] to deter all men from sin, and for
   the greater [491] consolation of the godly, in their adversity; so will
   he have that day unknown to Men, that they may shake off all carnal
   security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour,
   the [492] Lord will come; and may ever be prepared to say, [493] Come
   Lord Jesus, Come quickly, Amen.

AN APPENDIX

   Whosoever reads, and impartially considers what we have in our forgoing
   confession declared, may readily perceive, That we do not only
   concenter with all other true Christians on the Word of God (revealed
   in the Scriptures of truth) as the foundation and rule of our faith and
   worship. But that we have also industriously endeavoured to manifest,
   That in the fundamental Articles of Christianity we mind the same
   things, and have therefore expressed our belief in the same words, that
   have on the like occasion been spoken by other societies of Christians
   before us.

   This we have done, That those who are desirous to know the principles
   of Religion which we hold and practise, may take an estimate from our
   selves (who jointly concur in this work) and may not be misguided,
   either by undue reports; or by the ignorance or errors of particular
   persons, who going under the same name with our selves, may give an
   occasion of scandalizing the truth we profess.

   And although we do differ from our brethren who are Paedobaptists; in
   the subject and administration of Baptisme, and such other
   circumstances as have a necessary dependence on our observance of that
   Ordinance, and do frequent our own assemblies for our mutual
   edification, and discharge of those duties, and services which we owe
   unto God, and in his fear to each other: yet we would not be from hence
   misconstrued, as if the discharge of our own consciences herein, did
   any wayes disoblige or alienate our affections, or conversation from
   any others that fear the Lord; but that we may and do as we have
   opportunity participate of the labors of those, whom God hath indued
   with abilities above our selves, and qualified, and called to the
   Ministry of the Word, earnestly desiring to approve our selves to be
   such, as follow after peace with holyness, and therefore we alwaies
   keep that blessed Irenicum, or healing Word of the Apostle before our
   eyes; if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
   this unto you; nevertheless whereto we have already attained; let us
   walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing, Phil 3. v. 15, 16.

   Let it not therefore be judged of us (because much hath been written on
   this subject, and yet we continue this our practise different from
   others) that it is out of obstinacy, but rather as the truth is, that
   we do herein according to the best of our understandings worship God,
   out of a pure mind yielding obedience to his precept, in that method
   which we take to be most agreeable to the Scriptures of truth, and
   primitive practise.

   It would not become us to give any such intimation, as should carry a
   semblance that what we do in the service of God is with a doubting
   conscience, or with any such temper of mind that we do thus for the
   present, with a reservation that we will do otherwise hereafter upon
   more mature deliberation; nor have we any cause so to do, being fully
   perswaded, that what we do is agreeable to the will of God. Yet we do
   heartily propose this, that if any of the Servants of our Lord Jesus
   shall, in the Spirit of meekness, attempt to convince us of any mistake
   either in judgement or practise, we shall diligently ponder his
   arguments; and accompt him our chiefest friend that shall be an
   instrument to convert us from any error that is in our ways, for we
   cannot wittingly do any thing against the truth, but all things for the
   truth.

   And therefore we have indeavoured seriously to consider, what hath been
   already offered for our satisfaction in this point; and are loth to say
   any more lest we should be esteemed desirous of renewed contests
   thereabout: yet forasmuch as it may justly be expected that we shew
   some reason, why we cannot acquiesce in what hath been urged against
   us; we shall with as much brevity as may consist with plainness,
   endeavour to satisfie the expectation of those that shall peruse what
   we now publish in this matter also.

   1. As to those Christians who consent with us, That Repentance from
   dead works, and Faith towards God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, is
   required in persons to be Baptized; and do therefore supply the defect
   of the (infant being uncapable of making confession of either) by
   others who do undertake these things for it. Although we do find by
   Church history that this hath been a very antient practise; yet
   considering, that the same Scripture which does caution us against
   censuring our brother, with whom we shall all stand before the judgment
   seat of Christ, does also instruct us, That every one of us shall give
   an accompt of himself to God, and whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin.
   Rom. 14:4, 10, 12, 23. Therefore we cannot for our own parts be
   perswaded in our own minds, to build such a practise as this, upon an
   unwritten tradition: But do rather choose in all points of Faith and
   Worship, to have recourse to the holy Scriptures, for the information
   of our judgment, and regulation of our practise; being well assured
   that a conscientious attending thereto, is the best way to prevent, and
   rectifie our defects and errors. 2 Tim. 3.16,17. And if any such case
   happen to be debated between Christians, which is not plainly
   determinable by the Scriptures, we think it safest to leave such things
   undecided until the second coming of our Lord Jesus; as they did in the
   Church of old, until there should arise a Priest with Urim and Thummim,
   that might certainly inform them of the mind of God thereabout, Ezra
   2.62,63.

   2. As for those our Christian brethren who do ground their arguments
   for Infants baptism, upon a presumed faederal Holiness, or
   Church-Membership, we conceive they are deficient in this, that albeit
   this Covenant-Holiness and Membership should be as is supposed, in
   reference unto the Infants of Believers; yet no command for Infant
   baptism does immediately and directly result from such a quality, or
   relation.

   All instituted Worship receives its sanction from the precept, and is
   to be thereby governed in all the necessary circumstances thereof.

   So it was in the Covenant that God made with Abraham and his Seed. The
   sign whereof was appropriated only to the Male, notwithstanding that
   the female seed as well as the Male were comprehended in the Covenant
   and part of the Church of God; neither was this sign to be affixed to
   any Male Infant till he was eight dayes old, albeit he was within the
   Covenant from the first moment of his life; nor could the danger of
   death, or any other supposed necessity, warrant the circumcising of him
   before the set time, nor was there any cause for it; the commination of
   being cut off from his people, being only upon the neglect, or contempt
   of the precept.

   Righteous Lot was nearly related to Abraham in the flesh, and
   contemporary with him, when this Covenant was made; yet inasmuch as he
   did not descend from his loynes, nor was of his houshold family
   (although he was of the same houshold of faith with Abraham) yet
   neither Lot himself nor any of his posterity (because of their descent
   from him) were signed with the signature of this Covenant that was made
   with Abraham and his seed.

   This may suffice to shew, that where there was both an expresse
   Covenant, and a sign thereof (such a Covenant as did separate the
   persons with whom it was made, and all their off-spring from all the
   rest of the world, as a people holy unto the Lord, and did constitute
   them the visible Church of God, (though not comprehensive of all the
   faithful in the world) yet the sign of this Covenant was not affixed to
   all the persons that were within this Covenant, nor to any of them till
   the prefixt season; nor to other faithful servants of God, that were
   not of descent from Abraham. And consequently that it depends purely
   upon the will of the Law-giver, to determine what shall be the sign of
   his Covenant, unto whom, at what season, and upon what terms, it shall
   be affixed.

   If our brethren do suppose baptism to be the seal of the Covenant which
   God makes with every beleiver (of which the Scriptures are altogether
   silent) it is not our concern to contend with them herein; yet we
   conceive the seal of that Covenant is the indwelling of the Spirit of
   Christ in the particular and individual persons in whom he resides, and
   nothing else, neither do they or we suppose that baptism is in any such
   manner substituted in the place of circumcision, as to have the same
   (and no other) latitude, extent, or terms, then circumcision had; for
   that was suited only for the Male children, baptism is an ordinance
   suited for every beleiver, whether male, or femal. That extended to all
   the males that were born in Abrahams house, or bought with his money,
   equally with the males that proceeded from his own loynes; but baptisme
   is not so far extended in any true Christian Church that we know of, as
   to be administred to all the poor infidel servants, that the members
   thereof purchase for their service, and introduce into their families;
   nor to the children born of them in their house.

   But we conceive the same parity of reasoning may hold for the ordinance
   of baptism as for that of circumcision; Exodus 12.49. viz. one law for
   the stranger, as for the home born: If any desire to be admitted to all
   the ordinances, and priviledges of Gods house, the door is open; upon
   the same terms that any one person was ever admitted to all, or any of
   those priviledges, that belong to the Christian Church; may all persons
   of right challenge the like admission.

   As for that text of Scripture, Rom. 4.11. He received circumcision a
   seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
   uncircumcised; we conceive if the Apostles scope in that place be duly
   attended to, it will appear that no argument can be taken from thence
   to inforce Infant baptism; and forasmuch as we find a full and fair
   account of those words given by the learned Dr. Lighfoot (a man not to
   be suspected of partiality in this controversie) in his Hor. Hebrai, on
   the I Cor. 7.19. p.42, 43. we shall transcribe his words at large,
   without any comment of our own upon them.

   Circumcision is nothing, if we respect the time, for now it was without
   use, that end of it being especially fulfilled; for which it had been
   instituted: this end the Apostle declares in these words, Rom. 4.11.
   sphragida. But I fear that by most translations they are not
   sufficiently suited to the end of circumcision, and the scope of the
   Apostle whilst something of their own is by them inserted.

   And after the Doctor hath represented diverse versions of the words
   agreeing for the most part in sense with that which we have in our
   Bibles he thus proceeds.

   Other versions are to the same purpose; as if circumcision was given to
   Abraham for a Seal of that Righteousness which he had being yet
   uncircumcised, which we will not deny to be in some sense true, but we
   believe that circumcision had chiefly a far different respect.

   Give me leave thus to render the words; And he received the sign of
   circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which was to be in
   the uncircumcision, Which was to be (I say) not which had been, not
   that which Abraham had whilst he was yet uncircumcised; but that which
   his uncircumcised seed should have, that is the Gentiles, who in time
   to come should imitate the faith of Abraham.

   Now consider well on what occasion circumcision was instituted unto
   Abraham, setting before thine eyes the history thereof, Gen. 17.

   This promise is first made unto him, Thou shalt be the Father of many
   Nations (in what sense the Apostle explaineth in that chapter) and then
   there is subjoined a double seal for the confirmation of the thing, to
   wit, the change of the name Abram into Abraham, and the institution of
   circumcision. v4. Behold as for me, my Covenant is with thee, and thou
   shalt be the Father of many Nations. Wherefore was his name called
   Abraham? for the sealing of this promise. Thou shalt be the Father of
   many Nations. And wherefore was circumcision instituted to him? For the
   sealing of the same promise. Thou shalt be the Father of many Nations.
   So that this is the sense of the Apostle; most agreeable to the
   institution of circumcision; he received the sign of circumcision, a
   seal of the Righteousness of Faith which in time to come the
   uncircumcision (or the Gentiles) should have and obtain.

   Abraham had a twofold seed, natural, of the Jews; and faithful, of the
   believing Gentiles: his natural seed was signed with the sign of
   circumcision, first indeed for the distinguishing of them from all
   other Nations whilst they as yet were not the seed of Abraham, but
   especially for the memorial of the justification of the Gentiles by
   faith, when at length they should become his seed. Therefore
   circumcision was of right to cease, when the Gentiles were brought in
   to the faith, forasmuch as then it had obtained its last and chief end,
   & thenceforth circumcision is nothing.

   Thus far he, which we earnestly desire may be seriously weighed, for we
   plead not his authority, but the evidence of truth in his words.

   3. Of whatsoever nature the holiness of the children mentioned, 1 Cor.
   7.12. be, yet they who do conclude that all such children (whether
   Infants or of riper years) have from hence an immediate right to
   baptism, do as we conceive put more into the conclusion, then will be
   found in the premisses.

   For although we do not determine positively concerning the Apostles
   scope in the holiness here mentioned, so as to say it is this, or that,
   and no other thing; Yet it is evident that the Apostle does by it
   determine not only the lawfulness but the expedience also of a
   beleivers cohabitation with an unbeliever, in the state of marriage.

   And we do think that although the Apostles asserting of the unbelieving
   yokefellow to be sanctified by the believer, should carry in it
   somewhat more then is in the bare marriage of two infidels, because
   although the marriage covenant have a divine sanction so as to make the
   wedlock of two unbelievers a lawful action, and their conjunction and
   cohabitation in that respect undefiled, yet there might be no ground to
   suppose from thence, that both or either of their persons are thereby
   sanctified; and the Apostle urges the cohabitation of a believer with
   an infidel in the state of wedlock from this ground that the
   unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife; nevertheless
   here you have the influence of a believers faith ascending from an
   inferior to a superior relation; from the wife to the husband who is
   her head, before it can descend to their off-spring. And therefore we
   say, whatever be the nature or extent of the holiness here intended, we
   conceive it cannot convey to the children an immediate right to
   baptism; because it would then be of another nature, and of a larger
   extent, then the root, and original from whence it is derived, for it
   is clear by the Apostles argument that holiness cannot be derived to
   the child from the sanctity of one parent only, if either father or
   mother be (in the sense intended by the Apostle) unholy or unclean, so
   will the child be also, therefore for the production of an holy seed it
   is necessary that both the Parents be sanctified; and this the Apostle
   positively asserts in the first place to be done by the beleiving
   parent, although the other be an unbeliever; and then consequentially
   from thence argues, the holiness of their children. Hence it follows,
   that as the children have no other holiness then what they derive from
   both their Parents; so neither can they have any right by this holiness
   to any spiritual priviledge but such as both their Parents did also
   partake of: and therefore if the unbelieving Parent (though sanctified
   by the believing Parent) have not thereby a right to baptism, neither
   can we concieve, that there is any such priviledge, derived to the
   children by their birth-holiness.

   Besides if it had been the usual practice in the Apostles dayes for the
   father or mother that did beleive, to bring all their children with
   them to be baptised; then the holiness of the beleiving Corinthians
   children, would not at all have been in question when this Epistle was
   written; but might have been argued from their passing under that
   ordinance, which represented their new birth, although they had derived
   no holiness from their Parents, by their first birth; and would have
   layen as an exception against the Apostles inference, else were your
   Children unclean, &c. But of the sanctification of all the children of
   every beleiver by this ordinance, or any other way, then what is
   beforementioned, the Scripture is altogether silent.

   This may also be added; that if this birth holiness do qualifie all the
   children of every believer, for the ordinance of baptism; why not for
   all other ordinances? for the Lords Supper as was practiced for a long
   time together? for if recourse be had to what the Scriptures speak
   generally of this subject; it will be found, that the same qualities
   which do intitle any person to baptism, do so also for the
   participation of all the Ordinances, and priviledges of the house of
   God, that are common to all believers.

   Whosoever can and does interrogate his good Conscience towards God when
   he is baptised (as every one must do that makes it to himself a sign of
   Salvation) is capable of doing the same thing, in every other act of
   worship that he performs.

   4. The arguments and inferences that are usually brought for, or
   against Infant baptism from those few instances which the Scriptures
   afford us of whole families being baptised; are only conjectural; and
   therefore cannot of themselves, be conclusive on either hand: yet in
   regard most that treat on this subject for Infant baptism, do (as they
   conceive) improve these instances to the advantage of their argument:
   we think it meet (in like manner as in the cases before mentioned so in
   this) to shew the invalidity of such inferences.

   Cornelius worshipped God with all his house, the Jaylor, and Crispus
   the chief ruler of the Synagogue, believed God with each of their
   houses. The houshold of Stephanus addicted themselves to the Ministry
   of the Saints: so that thus far Worshipping, and Believing runs
   parallel with Baptism. And if Lydia, had been a married person, when
   she believed, it is probable her husband would also have been named by
   the Apostle, as in like cases, inasmuch as he would have been not only
   a part, but the head of that baptised houshold.

   Who can assign any probable reason, why the Apostle should make mention
   of four or five housholds being baptised and no more? or why he does so
   often vary in the method of his salutations, Rom. 1. 6. sometimes
   mentioning only particular persons of great note, other times such, and
   the Church in their house? the Saints that were with them; and them
   belonging to Narcissus, who were in the Lord; thus saluting either
   whole families, or part of families, or only particular persons in
   families, considered as they were in the Lord, for if it had been an
   usual practise to baptize all children, with their parents; there were
   then many thousands of the Jews which believed, and a great number of
   the Gentiles, in most of the principle Cities in the World, and among
   so many thousands, it is more then probable there would have been some
   thousands of housholds baptised; why then should the Apostle in this
   respect signalize one family of the Jews and three or four of the
   Gentiles, as particular instances in a case that was common? whoever
   supposes that we do willfully debar our children, from the benefit of
   any promise, or priviledge, that of right belongs to the children of
   believing parents; they do entertain over severe thoughts of us: to be
   without natural affections is one of the characters of the worst of
   persons; in the worst of times. Wee do freely confesse our selves
   guilty before the Lord, in that we have not with more circumspection
   and diligence train'd up those that relate to us in the fear of the
   Lord; and do humbly and earnestly pray, that our omissions herein may
   be remitted, and that they may not redound to the prejudice of our
   selves, or any of ours: but with respect to that duty that is incumbent
   on us, we acknowledge our selves obliged by the precepts of God, to
   bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, to
   teach them his fear, both by instruction and example; and should we set
   light by this precept, it would demonstrate that we are more vile then
   the unnatural Heathen, that like not to retain God in their knowledge,
   our baptism might then be justly accompted, as no baptism to us.

   There are many special promises that do incourage us as well as
   precepts, that do oblige us to the close pursuit of our duty herein:
   that God whom we serve, being jealous of his Worship, threatens the
   visiting of the Fathers transgression upon the children to the third
   and fourth generation of them that hate him: yet does more abundantly
   extend his mercy, even to thousands (respecting the offspring and
   succeding generations) of them that love him, and keep his commands.

   When our Lord rebuked his disciples for prohibiting the access of
   little children that were brought to him, that he might pray over them,
   lay his hands upon them, and blesse them, does declare, that of such is
   the Kingdom of God. And the Apostle Peter in answer to their enquiry,
   that desired to know what they must do to be saved, does not only
   instruct them in the necessary duty of repentance and baptism; but does
   also thereto encourage them, by that promise which had reference both
   to them, and their children; if our Lord Jesus in the forementioned
   place, do not respect the qualities of children (as elsewhere) as to
   their meekness, humility, and sincerity, and the like; but intend also
   that those very persons and such like, appertain to the Kingdom of God,
   and if the Apostle Peter in mentioning the aforesaid promise, do
   respect not only the present and succeeding generations of those Jews,
   that heard him, (in which sense the same phrase doth occurre in
   Scripture) but also the immediate off-spring of his auditors; whether
   the promise relate to the gift of the Holy Spirit, or of eternal life,
   or any grace, or priviledge tending to the obtaining thereof; it is
   neither our concerne nor our interest to confine the mercies, and
   promises of God, to a more narrow, or lesse compasse then he is pleased
   gratiously to offer and intend them; nor to have a light esteem of
   them; but are obliged in duty to God, and affection to our children; to
   plead earnestly with God and use our utmost endeavours that both our
   selves, and our off-spring may be partakers of his Mercies and gracious
   Promises: yet we cannot from either of these texts collect a sufficient
   warrant for us to baptize our children before they are instructed in
   the principles of the Christian Religion.

   For as to the instance in little children, it seems by the disciples
   forbidding them, that they were brought upon some other account, not so
   frequent as Baptism must be supposed to have been, if from the
   beginning believers children had been admitted thereto: and no account
   is given whether their parents were baptised believers or not; and as
   to the instance of the Apostle; if the following words and practice,
   may be taken as an interpretation of the scope of that promise we
   cannot conceive it does refer to infant baptism, because the text does
   presently subjoyn; Then they that gladly received the word were
   baptised.

   That there were some believing children of believing parents in the
   Apostles dayes is evident from the Scriptures, even such as were then
   in ther fathers family, and under their parents tuition, and education;
   to whom the Apostle in several of his Epistles to the Churches, giveth
   commands to obey their parents in the Lord; and does allure their
   tender years to hearken to this precept, by reminding them that it is
   the first command with promise.

   And it is recorded by him for the praise of Timothy, and encouragement
   of parents betimes to instaruct, and children early to attend to godly
   instruction, that apo brephous from a child, he had known the holy
   Scriptures.

   The Apostle John rejoyced greatly when he found of the children of the
   Elect Lady walking in the truth; and the children of her Elect Sister
   joyn with the Apostle in his salutation.

   But that this was not generally so, that all the children of believers
   were accounted for believers (as they would have been if they had been
   all baptised) may be collected from the character which the Apostle
   gives of persons fit to be chosen to Eldership in the Church which was
   not common to all believers; among others this is expressely one, viz.
   If there be any having believing, or faithful children, not accused of
   Riot or unruly; and we may from the Apostles writings on the same
   subject collect the reason of this qualification, viz. That in case the
   person designed for this office to teach and rule in the house of God,
   had children capable of it; there might be first a proof of his
   ability, industry, and successe in this work in his own family; and
   private capacity, before he was ordained to the exercise of this
   authority in the Church, in a publick capacity, as a Bishop in the
   house of God.

   These things we have mentioned as having a direct reference unto the
   controversie between our brethren and us; other things that are more
   abstruse and prolix, which are frequently introduced into this
   controversie, but do not necessarily concern it, we have purposely
   avoided; that the distance between us and our brethren may not be by us
   made more wide; for it is our duty, and concern so far as is possible
   for us (retaining a good conscience towards God) to seek a more entire
   agreement and reconciliation with them.

   We are not insenible that as to the order of Gods house, and entire
   communion therein there are some things wherein we (as well as others)
   are not at a full accord among our selves, as for instance; the known
   principle, and state of the consciences of diverse of us, that have
   agreed in this Confession is such; that we cannot hold
   Church-communion, with any other then Baptized-believers, and Churches
   constituted of such; yet some others of us have a greater liberty and
   freedom in our spirits that way; and therefore we have purposely
   omitted the mention of things of that nature, that we might concurre,
   in giving this evidence of our agreement, both among our selves, and
   with other good Christians, in those important articles of the
   Christian Religion, mainly insisted on by us: and this notwithstanding
   we all esteem it our chief concern, both among our selves, and all
   others that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
   our Lord, both theirs and ours, and love him in sincerity, to endeavour
   to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; and in order
   thereunto, to exercise all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,
   forbearing one another in love.

   And we are perswaded if the same method were introduced into frequent
   practice between us and our Christian friends who agree with us in all
   the fundamental articles of the Christian faith (though they do not so
   in the subject and administration of baptism) it would soon beget a
   better understanding, and brotherly affection between us.

   In the beginning of the Christian Church, when the doctrine of the
   baptism of Christ was not universally understood, yet those that knew
   only the baptism of John, were the Disciples of the Lord Jesus; and
   Apollos an eminent Minister of the Gospel of Jesus.

   In the beginning of the reformation of the Christian Church, and
   recovery from that Egyptian darkness wherein our forefathers for many
   generations were held in bondage; upon recourse had to the Scriptures
   of truth, different apprehensions were conceived, which are to this
   time continued, concerning the practise of this Ordinance.

   Let not our zeal herein be misinterpreted: that God whom we serve is
   jealous of his worship. By his gracious providence the Law thereof, is
   continued amongst us; and we are forewarned by what hapned in the
   Church of the Jews, that it is necessary for every generation, and that
   frequently in every generation to consult the divine oracle, compare
   our worship with the rule, and take heed to what doctrines we receive
   and practise.

   If the ten commands exhibited in the popish Idolatrous service books
   had been received as the entire law of God, because they agree in
   number with his ten commands, and also in the substance of nine of
   them; the second Commandment forbidding Idolatry had been utterly lost.

   If Ezra and Nehemiah had not made a diligent search into the particular
   parts of Gods law, and his worship; the Feast of Tabernacles (which for
   many centuries of years, had not been duly observed, according to the
   institution, though it was retained in the general notion) would not
   have been kept in due order.

   So may it be now as to many things relating to the service of God,
   which do retain the names proper to them in their first institution,
   but yet through inadvertency (where there is no sinister design) may
   vary in their circumstances, from their first institution. And if by
   means of any antient defection, or of that general corruption of the
   service of God, and interruption of his true worship, and persecution
   of his servants by the Antichristian Bishop of Rome, for many
   generations; those who do consult the Word of God, cannot yet arrive at
   a full and mutual satisfaction among themselves, what was the practise
   of the primitive Christian Church, in some points relating to the
   Worship of God: yet inasmuch as these things are not of the essence of
   Christianity, but that we agree in the fundamental doctrines thereof,
   we do apprehend, there is sufficient ground to lay aside all bitterness
   and prejudice, and in the spirit of love and meekness to imbrace and
   own each other therein; leaving each other at liberty to perform such
   other services, (wherein we cannot concur) apart unto God, according to
   the best of our understanding.

DOCTRINE AND THEOLOGY OF THE CONFESSION

  What is a Confession of Faith?: Some Quotations

   "This little volume, is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of
   faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in
   controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in
   righteousness. Here the younger members of our church will have a body
   of divinity in small compass, and by means of Scriptural proofs, will
   be ready to give an account for the hope that is in them.

   Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of
   martyrs, confessors, reformers and saints. Above all, it is "the truth
   of God", against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail.

   Let your lives adorn your faith, let your example adorn your creed.
   Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no
   teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him, and owned by the
   Holy Spirit. Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out
   for you." C. H. Spurgeon (from the preface to the 1689 London Baptist
   Confession of Faith which his republished for use by his congregation).

   "A confession of our loyalty to the Bible is not enough. The most
   radical denials of biblical truth frequently coexist with a professed
   regard for the authority and testimony of the Bible. When men use the
   very words of the Bible to promote heresy, when the Word of truth is
   perverted to serve error, nothing less than a confession of Faith will
   serve publicly to draw the lines between truth and error. . . .

   The church is to "hold fast the form of sound words" (2 Tim. 1:13), to
   "contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the
   saints" (Jude 3), and to "stand fast with one spirit, with one soul
   striving for the faith of the gospel" (Phil. 1:27). In the fulfilment
   of this task, a confession is a useful tool for discriminating truth
   from error and for presenting in a small compass the central doctrines
   of the Bible in their integrity and due proportions. . . .

   Nevertheless, our confessions are not inherently sacrosanct or beyond
   revision and improvement; and, of course, church history did not stop
   in the seventeenth century. We are faced with errors today which those
   who drew up the great confessions were not faced with and which they
   did not explicitly address in the confessions, but it is a task to be
   undertaken with extreme caution. . . .

   A confession is a useful means for the public affirmation and defence
   of truth . . . (it) serves as a public standard of fellowship and
   discipline . . . (and it) serves as a concise standard by which to
   evaluate ministers of the Word." R. P. Martin in Samuel E. Waldron, A
   Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, (Evangelical
   Press, 1989), p9-23.

   "This may be affirmed, that no private Christian would fail to benefit
   largely from a deliberate and studious perusal and reperusal of the
   Confession of Faith or the express purpose of obtaining a clear and
   systematic conception of sacred truth, both as a whole, and with all
   its parts so arranged as to display their relative importance, and
   their mutual bearing upon, and illustration of each other. . .

   A confession of faith is not the very voice of Divine Truth, but the
   echo of that Truth from souls that have heard its utterance, felt its
   power, and are answering to its call." W. Hetherington (concerning the
   Westminster Confession of Faith).

   "This unique doctrinal and practical outlook of Reformed Baptists was
   summarised historically in the London Confession of Faith published in
   1689. For almost 300 years this has been the standard doctrinal
   statement of such Baptists. Most Reformed Baptists today hold to this
   Confession as comprehensively summarising their understanding of the
   Word of God". Samuel Waldron, Baptists Roots in America, p.viii, ix)

  DOCUMENTARY SOURCES OF THE CONFESSION

   The 1689 London Baptist Confession comes principally from four sources:

   A. The Westminster Confession of Faith, 1646.

   This confession is distinctively puritan, presbyterian and
   paedobapitst, being the result of the sitting of the Westminster
   Assembly.

   B. The Savoy Declaration of Faith and Order, 1658.

   This confession is a revision of the Westminster which was Independent
   or Congregational in that it differed in the matters of church
   government and the autonomy of the local church.

   C. The First London Baptist Confession (1644).

   During the 17th Century, while under persecution, Baptists published a
   number of Confessions to clarify their doctrinal position and to refute
   errors with which they had been branded. This confession was subscribed
   to by seven Particular Baptist congregations in the London area. It is
   likely to have subsequently become the doctrinal position of many other
   congregations. It was distinctively Calvinistic and Baptist while also
   rejecting many of the Continental Anabaptist tenets of pelagianism,
   pacifism, and the rejection of involvement of christians in civil
   office. Five of the seven churches which signed the 1644 were also
   signatories to the 1689 Confession.

   D. The work of William Collins and Nehemiah Coxe.

   [122]William Collins and [123]Nehemiah Coxe were elders of the Petty
   France church in London. It is likely that they were responsible for
   the collation and editing of the above three documents to produce this
   Confession of Faith. The first extant reference to the Confession is
   found recorded in the Petty France Church Book on the 26th of August
   1677, it states, "It was agreed that a Confession of Faith w(ith) the
   Appendix thereto having bene(been) read and considered by the
   Bre(thren): should be published". Given the spiritual stature of both
   Coxe and Collins, their involvement in other literary activities,
   joined with the fact that it appears that the Petty France Church was
   intimately aware of the Confession it make it very likely that they
   were its major editors (see [124]Origins of the Confession). Although
   the Confession was published in 1677, it was done so anonymously due to
   the persecution of the times. It was not until 1689, after the
   "Glorious Revolution" under William and Mary of Orange that this
   Confession was published with the names of the [125]subscribers and the
   churches they represented attached and has become known as the 1689
   London Baptist Confession of Faith or the Second London Baptist
   Confession of Faith.

   Of the 160 paragraphs which make up the 1689 London Baptist Confession
   of Faith, 146 are directly derived from the Savoy declaration, eight
   are derived from the 1644 Confession and six from the editorial work
   [126]Collins and [127]Coxe.

  The Letter Calling for the 1689 General Assembly

   (This material is taken from Joseph Ivimey's, History of the English
   Baptists, Vol. 1: Pg. 478-480).

   The following is a copy of [the letter] sent to the church at Luppitt,
   in Devonshire, the place where the present church at Upottery then met.

   London, July 22, 1689.

   To the Church of Christ in Luppitt, kind Salutations.

   "WE the elders and ministering brethren of the churches in and about
   London, being several times assembled together to consider of the
   present state of the baptized congregations, not only in this city, but
   also in the country, cannot but first of all, adore the divine wisdom
   and goodness of Almighty God, in respect of his late most gracious
   providence, for our deliverance from that dismal dispensation, which
   threatened us from the continual and unwearied attempts and designs of
   the enemy of our sacred religion and civil liberties; by which means
   our sinking and drooping spirits are again revived, and our earnest
   hopes and long expectations raised, and afresh quickened, in respect of
   the more full and perfect deliverance of the church of God, and his
   more glorious appearance, for the accomplishing of those gracious
   promises and prophecies contained in the holy scripture relating to the
   latter days.

   "But in the second place, we cannot but bewail the present condition
   our churches seem to be in; fearing that much of that former strength,
   life, and vigour, which attended us is much gone; and in many places
   the interest of our Lord Jesus Christ seems to be much neglected which
   is in our hands, and the congregation to languish, and our beauty to
   fade away (which thing, we have some ground to judge, you cannot but be
   sensible of as well as we); and from hence we have been put upon most
   mature and serious considerations of such things that may be the cause
   thereof, and amongst others are come to this result: That the great
   neglect of the present ministry is one thing, together with that
   general unconcernedness there generally seems to be, of giving fit and
   proper encouragement for the raising up an able and honourable ministry
   for the time to come; with many other things which, we hope, we are not
   left wholly in the dark about, which we find we are not in a capacity
   to prevent and cure (as instruments in the hand of God, and his
   blessing attending our christian endeavours) unless we can obtain a
   general meeting here in London of two principal brethren (of every
   church of the same faith with us) in every county respectively. We do
   therefore humbly intreat and beseech you, that you would be pleased to
   appoint two of your brethren (one of the ministry, and one principal
   brother of your congregation with him) as your messengers; and send
   them up to meet with the rest of the elders and and [sic.] brethren of
   the churches in London, on the 3rd of September next; and then we hope
   to consider such things that may much tend to the honour of God, and
   further the peace, well-being, establishment at present, as also the
   future comfort of the churches. We hope you will readily,
   notwithstanding the charge, comply with our pious and christian desire
   herein; and in the mean time, to signify your intentions forthwith in a
   letter; which we would have you direct to our reverend and well beloved
   brethren, Mr. H. Knowles, or Mr. W. Kiffin. This is all at present from
   us, your brethren and labourers in God's vineyard, who greet you well
   in our Lord Jesus Christ, and subscribe ourselves your servants in the
   gospel.

  The 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith in its Historical and Theological
  Context

   The Second London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1677/89, along with
   its predecessor of 1644/46, are perhaps the two most influential
   Baptist Confessions in existence. In many ways, the more recent
   Confession eclipses the earlier in importance, for by 1689 copies of
   the First London Confession had become scarce, so much so that one of
   the key subscribers to the Second Confession, [138]Benjamin Keach,
   stated in 1692 that he knew nothing of the earlier document until
   someone informed him of it earlier that year. It was the Second
   Confession which quickly became the standard of Calvinistic Baptist
   orthodoxy in England, North America, and today, in many parts of the
   world.

   This Confession, influential as it is, may perhaps best be understood
   against its historical and theological backgrounds. It did not appear
   de novo, the product of a sudden burst of theological insight on the
   part of an author or authors, but in the tradition of good Confession
   making, it is largely dependent on the statements of earlier Reformed
   Confessions. A superficial reading will demonstrate that it is based,
   to a large degree, on that most Puritan of documents, the Westminster
   Confession of Faith of 1647. A closer inspection will reveal that it is
   even more intimately related to the revision of the Westminster
   Confession made by John Owen and others in 1658, popularly known as the
   Savoy Declaration and Platform of Polity. In almost every case the
   editors of the Baptist Confession follow the revisions of the Savoy
   editors when they differ from the Westminster document. In addition,
   the editors make occasional use of phraseology from the First London
   Confession. When all of this material is accounted for, there is very
   little left that is new and original to the 1677/89 Confession.

   This heavy dependence on previous sources was very much part of the
   purpose of the composition of the Confession. In the epistle "To the
   Judicious and Impartial Reader" attached to the first edition of the
   Confession, the editors state:

   "And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments,
   in this, doth vary from the former [i.e. the First London Confession]
   (although the substance of the matter is the same) we shall freely
   impart to you the reason and occasion thereof. One thing that greatly
   prevailed with us to undertake this work, was (not only to give a full
   account of ourselves, to those Christians that differ from us about the
   subject of Baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence arise,
   unto those that have any account of our labors, in their instruction,
   and establishment in the great truths of the Gospel; in the clear
   understanding, and steady belief of which, our comfortable walking with
   God, and fruitfulness before him, in all our ways, is most neerly
   concerned; and therefore we did conclude it necessary to expresse our
   selves the more fully, and distinctly; and also to fix on such a method
   as might be most comprehensive of those things which we designed to
   explain our sense, and belief of; and finding no defect, in this
   regard, in that fixed on by the assembly [i.e. the Westminster
   Assembly], and after them by those of the Congregational way [i.e. the
   Savoy Synod], we did readily conclude it best to retain the same order
   in our present confession: and also, when we observed that those last
   mentioned, did in their confession (for reasons which seemed of weight
   both to themselves and others) choose not only to express their mind in
   words concurrent with the former in sense, concerning all those
   articles wherein they were agreed, but also for the most part without
   any variation of the terms we did in like manner conclude it best to
   follow their example in making use of the very same words with them
   both, in these articles (which are very many) wherein our faith and
   doctrine is the same with theirs, and this we did, the more abundantly,
   to manifest our consent with both, in all fundamental articles of the
   Christian Religion, as also with many others, whose orthodox
   confessions have been published to the world; on the behalf of the
   Protestants in divers Nations and Cities: and also to convince all,
   that we have no itch to clogge Religion with new words, but do readily
   acquiesce in that form of sound words, which hath been, in consent with
   the holy Scriptures, used by others before us, hereby declaring before
   God, Angels, & Men. our hearty agreement with them, in that wholesome
   Protestant Doctrine, which with so clear evidence of Scriptures they
   have asserted: some things indeed, are in some places added, some terms
   omitted, and some few changed, but these alterations are of that
   nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or suspition of
   unsoundness in the faith, from any of our brethren upon account of
   them".

   These words are of real importance, and need to be considered very
   carefully. The Baptists were concerned to demonstrate to all that their
   doctrinal convictions had been, from the very start, orthodox and to a
   large degree identical with the convictions of the Puritans around
   them. This was true of the First London Confession, published prior to
   the Westminster Standards, which was heavily dependent on the [139]1596
   True Confession, and on the writings of [140]William Ames. In both of
   their general Confessions, the Baptists purposely used existing
   documents in order to demonstrate their concurrence with the
   theological convictions of their Puritan contemporaries. In the quote
   above, they argue that the doctrines expressed in both Baptist
   Confessions are the same, but they have chosen to base the newer
   Confession upon the more recent and widely available documents of
   Westminster and Savoy. By doing this, they were declaring with some
   vigor their own desire to be placed in the broad stream of English
   Reformed Confessional Christianity.

   This methodology provides us with some insight into understanding the
   Confession and its teaching. When it concurs with these other
   documents, it can be read as an endorsement of the views espoused by
   those Presbyterians and Independents who subscribed those documents,
   and of the theological works they published in defense of the
   Confessional statements. Thus, if one wonders how the Baptists
   understood the doctrine of the Decrees of God, or Justification, or the
   application of the Law to the conscience of man, or how they worked out
   the implications of the teaching on the Perseverance of the Saints, one
   may consult the writings of paedobaptist Puritans with much profit.
   Since both the Westminster Confession and the Savoy Declaration are
   readily available, it is relatively easy to compare the documents in
   order to determine agreement. Of course, not every word of every author
   is necessarily a fair representation of their views, but in general,
   their method implies substantial theological agreement with the
   writings of their orthodox contemporaries.

   When the Confession departs from either of these documents, we should
   take note. It is at these points that the Baptists express their
   distinctive contributions to Christian Theology. Sadly, few of their
   theological writings in defense of their views are available to us
   today, though it is hoped that this will soon change.

   Their methodology also explains the reason why certain subjects are
   addressed in the Confession. In the troubled times of the second half
   of the Seventeenth Century, topics such as the relationship between
   church and state, the role of the magistrate, and even the Christian
   doctrine of marriage were important issues. Long and heated debates
   over these questions fired the furnace of controversy. Recognizing many
   of the problems inherent in a state church, especially when that church
   was ruled by a foreign power such as Rome, the Independents and the
   Baptists were very much concerned for liberty of conscience. The
   Presbyterian party, with an ecclesiology more conducive to a national
   church, had some within its ranks who argued strongly against
   toleration for any dissenters. One is reminded of John Milton's famous
   phrase "New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large". The attitude of
   many Presbyterians was the same as that of their Episcopalian
   predecessors: those in power make the rules, and everyone else must
   submit. During the [141]Commonwealth era, and Cromwell's
   [142]Protectorate, a measure of liberty and toleration was given to
   many religious groups. The question at issue was: Should the civil
   ruler enforce the first table of God's Law? For the modern reader, the
   question seems simple and straightforward, but it was not so clear in
   the 17th Century. Each of these English Reformed Confessions,
   Westminster, Savoy and the Second London speak to the issue, and each
   provides a different approach.

   After the [143]Restoration of 1660, and the enforcement of the
   [144]Clarendon Code, non-conformists were subject to severe penal acts.
   It must also be remembered that the Protestants of England feared a
   return to Roman Catholicism throughout most of the century. Charles I
   and Charles II both married Roman Catholics, and James II was a
   professing Romanist. The old doctrines of the Reformation needed to be
   asserted in the face of this royal departure and its potential
   implications for church and society. From this mix came the pressing
   need to address these contemporary issues in a Confession, and accounts
   for the presence of topics which may seem less important at the
   beginning of the Twenty-first Century.

  The Origins of the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith

   Based on the available information, it is impossible to determine
   precisely the origins of the Second London Confession. There are,
   however, some indications which help us to narrow the field.

   The first known reference to the Confession is found in the manuscript
   Church book of the Petty France Church in London. On 26 August, 1677,
   this note was entered, "It was agreed that a Confession of faith, wth
   the Appendix thereto having bene read & considered by the Bre: should
   be published." Joseph Ivimey, the English Baptist historian of the
   early Nineteenth Century took this to imply that the Confession
   originated in the Petty France Church, and this is probably an accurate
   supposition.

   This church was one of the original seven London churches which
   together published the First London Confession of 1644/46. In 1675, two
   men of immense importance for Particular Baptist history, [146]Nehemiah
   Coxe and [147]William Collins, were ordained as co-pastors on the same
   day. Each of them was held in high regard by their brethren, being
   asked to produce significant theological works (see [148]Coxe and
   [149]Collins biographies), and would thus have been well equipped to
   serve as editors of the Confession of Faith. Coxe died in 1688, prior
   to the General Assembly of 1689. Though his name was not appended to
   the Confession in 1689, it deserves to be mentioned and remembered
   alongside that of his co-elder in association with this great document.

   A very interesting "advertisement" was appended to the fifth edition of
   the Confession (1720) which states:

   "This Confession of our Faith, together with the brief Instructions of
   the Principles of Christian Religion, or the Catechisms, both with the
   proofs in the margin, and also that with the words of the scriptures at
   length; with this Confession, put forth by the ministers, elders, and
   brethren of above one hundred congregations of Christians, baptized on
   profession of their faith in England and Wales, denying Arminiainism,
   owning the doctrine of personal election and final perseverance: having
   sold the property, right and title of the printing thereof, to John
   Marshall, bookseller, at the Bible in Gracechurch Street, by us,
   William Collins and Benjamin Keach, it is desired that all persons
   desirous to promote such useful books, do apply themselves to him".

   Since both [150]Collins and [151]Keach died by 1704, this note must
   have been appended to an earlier edition of the Confession. It
   indicates that Collins and Keach owned the publishing rights to these
   two documents, a circumstance that one might expect attending
   authorship. Does this note imply that Collins owned the rights to the
   Confession (Coxe having died many years before) and Keach those of the
   Catechism? There is no evidence to tie Keach with the origins of the
   Confession, though his name is often associated with the Catechism.
   While not certain, this is one possible reading of the statement, and
   would explain why Keach's name became attached to the Catechism.

   Though it cannot be stated with certainty, circumstantial evidence
   seems to point to [152]Coxe and [153]Collins as the originators of the
   Confession. They were both qualified and respected men, and the first
   mention of the document is found in their church book, approving its
   publication. Each one of them was requested to take the lead in
   theological writing, a fact that would be expected of such men. Until
   other evidence is found, this seems to be the most likely scenario for
   the origin of the Confession.

   [Editor's Note: The biographical material below is dependent to a large
   degree on Joseph Ivimey's History of the English Baptists, B.R. White's
   Association Records of the Particular Baptists of England, Wales and
   Ireland, as well as the occasional use of many other reference works,
   and supplemented by my own research. More full documentation will be
   provided in the forthcoming print volume on the documents of the
   Particular Baptists. Contact [154]James M. Renihan, Escondido, CA, for
   more information. The Particular Baptists held yearly national General
   Assemblies at London from 1689 to 1692, and the Narratives from these
   Assemblies still exist. Only the 1689 and 1692 Narratives contain a
   listing of the names of the men present. Thus, it is probable that some
   of these men were present at the 1690 and 1691 meetings, as well as the
   ones noted. The spellings of some of the place names have changed over
   the years.]

BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
     __________________________________________________________________

  Richard Adams

    Shad Thames, Southwark

   Richard Adams was a clergyman in the Church of England, Vicar of
   Humberstone, Leicestershire, in 1661. He had been trained for the
   ministry by the great anti-paedobaptist John Tombes. When he adopted a
   full-blown Baptist position is not known. The church he represented at
   the General Assembly, Shad Thames, was actually a General (Arminian)
   Baptist church. Adams was unable to persuade them to join with the
   Particular Baptists, and was called to serve as co-pastor with
   [193]William Kiffin at Devonshire Square, which church they both
   represented in 1692. Both he and Kiffin signed the [194]letter inviting
   churches to send representatives to the 1689 General Assembly. He died
   in 1716.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Charles Archer

    Hock-Norton, Oxon

   This village name is obviously incorrect, and should be Hook Norton.
   Charles Archer seems to have been pastor in Hook Norton as early as the
   1660s, and suffered persecution along with his co-elder James Wilmot in
   1664. Archer was present at both the 1689 and 1692 General Assemblies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  John Ball

    Tiverton, Devon

   Ball's position in the church at Tiverton is unsure, as no designation
   such as "minister", "elder" or "pastor" is mentioned after his name in
   the list of those attending the 1689 General Assembly, though this list
   implies that he was a "minister". Tristram Truvin is listed as
   "minister" from this church in the Narrative, and was clearly a pastor
   in the church. In 1690, Ball became a founding member of Tiverton's
   daughter church in Bampton, Devon, and was called "by unanimous consent
   upon tryall, to the office of Ruling Elders, or helps in goverm't for
   the better management of the affairs of the church" [from the
   manuscript church book]. Such an action seems to have been rare among
   the Particular Baptist churches, as most of them did not recognize a
   distinction between ruling and teaching elders.
     __________________________________________________________________

  George Barret

    Mile End Green, London

   Barret seems to have been a pastor in London since about 1669. He
   appears in many of the acts of the General Assembly, as well as in the
   1692 Narrative list, and may have been closely associated with
   [195]Benjamin Keach. He was one of the seven who sent out the original
   [196]invitation to the General Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Samuel Buttall

    Plymouth, Devon

   The story of Samuel Buttall and the Plymouth church is very
   interesting. Apparently a member of Henry Jessey's [197]open membership
   church in London (though Ivimey asserts that he was from Petty France),
   he is mentioned in 1675 as associated with the Broadmead church.
   Recognized as a [198]gifted brother, he carried on a ministry of
   preaching. The Plymouth church had been blessed by the spiritual
   ministry of Abraham Cheare, but after his death in 1668, the church
   went for 19 years under severe persecution without a pastor, and
   seriously declined. They called Robert Brown in 1687, but he died
   within three months of coming to Plymouth. Next, they called Robert
   Holdenby from Ireland, but he was almost immediately unhappy in his
   position, and stayed only until 1690. Buttall was in membership at this
   time, and attended the 1689 Assembly with Holdenby as representatives
   from Plymouth. After Holdenby departed, the church again faced the
   question of calling a new pastor. There was much indecision among the
   52 members, but the sisters of the church met together and submitted a
   tender letter to the brothers, suggesting that they consider Samuel
   Buttall as pastor. (It must be remembered that in most, though not all
   of the churches, the women did not participate in business meetings).
   The letter was well received, and Buttall was called. This is
   especially remarkable when one realizes that of the 52 members, 42 were
   women! Along with [199]James Hitt, Buttall represented Plymouth at the
   1692 Assembly. He remained at Plymouth until 1707.
     __________________________________________________________________

  John Carter

    Steventon, Bedford

   Joining this church in 1676, he was disciplined for "disorderly
   walking" in 1679, and restored in 1680. In 1689, or perhaps a year or
   two earlier, he was authorized by the church to preach publicly,
   probably as a [200]gifted brother. In the Narrative of the 1689
   Assembly, no office is listed next to his name, though his companion
   Stephen Howtherne is listed as pastor. He is not listed as attending
   the 1692 Assembly. The church records state that in 1693, he was a
   member of one of the London churches.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Hercules Collins

    Wapping, London

   Installed as pastor of the Wapping church on 23 March, 1676/77, this
   able minister was the author of several important devotional and
   practical works, including An Orthodox Catechism (1680) which is a
   Baptist recension of the Heidelberg Catechism. He was held in high
   esteem by his colleagues, and played an important part in the
   establishment of Particular Baptist Churches in London and the country.
   He died 4 Oct., 1702. John Piggot said of him in a funeral sermon, "his
   doctrine was agreeable to the Sentiments of the Reformed Churches in
   all Fundamental Articles of Faith, and [his example] did adorn the
   Doctrine of God our Saviour". His presence at all of the London General
   Assemblies must be noted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  William Collins

    Petty France, London

   William Collins received a thorough education, graduating B.D. and
   touring Europe prior to his call to serve at Petty France. In a funeral
   sermon preached by John Piggott, a fortnight after Collins' death on 30
   October, 1702, mention is made of the encouraging "Offers he had to
   join the National Church, which he judiciously refus'd; for 'twas
   Conscience, not Humour, that made him a Dissenter". The esteem in which
   he was held by his brethren may be noted in the fact that he was
   requested by the General Assembly to draw up a Catechism, and on the
   strength of this Joseph Ivimey asserts "it is probable that the Baptist
   Catechism was complied by Mr. Collins, though it has by some means of
   other been called Keach's Catechism". Later in his work, Ivimey
   transcribes a letter from Collins to Andrew Gifford, pastor of the
   Pithay Church in Bristol, and arguably the most important Particular
   Baptist outside of London. In the letter, Collins refers to the latest
   impression of the Catechism, and states that there are "some thousands
   left".

   Collins, according to Piggott, "was a studious elder and a good pastor,
   noted for his peacable spirit. The Subjects he ordinarily insisted on
   in the Course of his Ministry, were the great and important Truths of
   the Gospel, which he handled with great Judgment and Clearness. How
   would he open the Miseries of the Fall! And in how moving a manner
   would he discourse of the Excellency of Christ, and the Virtues of his
   Blood, and his willingness to save poor awaken'd burdned [sic.]
   Sinners!... His sermons were useful under the Influence of Divine
   Grace, to convert and edify, to enlighten and establish, being drawn
   from the Fountain of Truth, the Sacred Scriptures, with which he
   constantly convers'd in their Original Languages, having read the best
   Criticks, Antient and Modern; so that Men of the greatest Penetration
   might learn from his Pulpit-Discourses, as well as those of the meanest
   Capacity".

   Such a testimony of his character and abilities well suits one thought
   to be co-editor (along with [201]Nehemiah Coxe) of the Confession of
   Faith (see [202]Documentary Sources and [203]Origins of the Confession)
   and one to represent his church and [204]subscribe it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Nehemiah Coxe

    Petty France, London

   Nehemiah Coxe was the son of the early Particular Baptist leader
   Benjamin Coxe. In 1669, he joined the Bedford church made famous by
   John Bunyan, and in 1673 was called to serve as pastor of the church's
   sub-congregation at Hitchin. In 1674, he was censured by the Bedford
   church for certain "miscarriages". It may be that Coxe's words and
   practices were related to the issue of [205]open or closed membership,
   so hotly debated at the time. Benjamin Coxe clearly advocates a closed
   membership position in his published writings, while the Bedford
   church, and especially Bunyan, resisted such a notion with great vigor.
   Could Nehemiah have been advocating such views, which the Bedford
   people would view as having a tendency to make rents and divisions in
   the congregation? His appearance at the closed membership Petty France
   church so soon after this could help to explain the situation.

   Coxe was a qualified physician, skilled in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and
   a discerning theologian. When the West Country evangelist Thomas
   Collier began to deviate from the Calvinistic Orthodoxy of the London
   Churches, the elders in London asked Coxe to reply in print to
   Collier's views. He did this in his 1677 work Vindiciae Veritatis, or a
   Confutation of the Heresies and Gross Errours Asserted by Thomas
   Collier. In a brief epistle at the beginning of the work, they address
   the issue of Coxe's "inferiority in years", stating that he did not
   write the book out of a sense of personal ability, but at their
   request, because "we did judge him meet and of ability for the work"
   and because his responsibilities at the time provided him with the
   opportunity to answer Collier's errors. They say of this work, "we
   hope, we may truly say, without particular respect to his Person, he
   hath behaved himself with that modesty of Spirit, joined with that
   fulness and clearness of answer and strength of argument, that we
   comfortably conceive (by God's blessing) it may prove a good and
   soveraign Antidote against the poison". The book is a very powerful
   expression of Reformed doctrine. In 1681, during a period of
   persecution, Coxe published A Sermon Preached at the Ordination of an
   Elder and Deacons in a Baptized Congregation in London. This is a
   helpful summary of the roles and responsibilities of elders and
   deacons. Also in 1681, Coxe published A Discourse of the Covenants that
   God made with Men before the Law. Coxe's contemporary C.M. du Veil, in
   his 1685 Commentary on Acts, called Coxe "that great divine, eminent
   for all manner of learning", and referred to the "excellent" book A
   Discourse of the Covenants as full of "most weighty and solid
   arguments."

   It is clear that Nehemiah Coxe was held in high regard by his brethren,
   and would thus have been well equipped to serve as an editor of the
   Confession of Faith (see [206]Documentary Sources and [207]Origins of
   the Confession). He died in 1688, prior to the General Assembly of
   1689, leaving behind one son.

  Samuel Ewer

    Hemstead, Herts

   Samuel Ewer attended both the 1689 and 1692 Assemblies. In a funeral
   sermon delivered 24 December, 1708, John Piggott said of him, "He has
   distinguish'd himself for several Years as an exemplary Christian,
   whose Piety towards God, and Affability towards Men, have recommended
   him to the Esteem and Approbation of all . . . . He had a prudent and
   regular Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls. He ever
   express'd a just Indignation against Sin, and press'd after the highest
   degrees of Holiness". He wrote, in defense of believer baptism, a reply
   to Edward Hitchin's book The Infant's Cause Pleaded, Cleared and
   Vindicated, probably just before his death The book was very well
   received, and regarded by many as a thorough response to Hitchin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  William Facey

    Reading, Berks

   Apparently active in the [208]Western Association as early as 1656,
   Facey, according to B.R. White, suffered imprisonement in Exeter after
   the [209]Restoration. Since he is not mentioned in the list of
   ministers attending the 1692 General Assembly, he may have died by that
   year.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Daniel Finch

    Kingsworth, Herts

   Finch and the Kingsworth [Kensworth] church are known through their
   recently reprinted records. He was called, along with two other men, to
   serve as elders upon the death of their pastor in 1688, and represented
   his church in both 1689 and 1692. He died in 1694.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paul Fruin

    Warwick, Warwick

   According to B.R. White, Fruin was an elder at Dymock (Dimmock),
   Gloucestershire in 1653. He seems to have been called to Warwick in the
   1680s, and represented the church at the 1689 Assembly. In 1690, he was
   asked to preach upon trial for the eldership at the new church in
   Bampton, Devon, though he was not called as its first pastor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Andrew Gifford

    Bristol, Fryars, Som. & Glouc.

   This man was perhaps the most influential Particular Baptist leader
   outside of London. Born in 1642, baptized in June, 1659, called to
   serve as a [210]gifted brother in 1661, and ordained as pastor "the 3rd
   of the 6th month, 1677, by laying on of the hands of brother Daniel Dyk
   [[211]William Kiffin's co-elder at that time, (ed.)] and brother
   [212]Nehemiah Coxe, elders in London, with fasting and prayer in the
   church". He served the Pithay (Fryars) church in Bristol until his
   death in 1721. He was present at the General Assembly in 1692. His son
   and grandson also had notable ministries.

  John Harris

    Joiner's Hall, London

   He was one of the seven men who sent out the letter in July, 1689,
   urging the churches to send messengers to the planned General Assembly.
   By 1692, he was apparently dead, as he was not present at that General
   Assembly.

  Leonard Harrison

    Limehouse, London

   Harrison's church first appears on the scene at the 1689 General
   Assembly. He was present again in 1692, as well as at the re-formation
   of the London Baptist Association in 1704. He may have been closely
   affiliated with [213]Benjamin Keach.
     __________________________________________________________________

  William Hawkins

    Dimmock, Gloucester

   This man's name is spelled Hankins in the Narratives of the 1689 and
   1692 Assemblies. He also attended the Assembly at Bristol in 1693.
     __________________________________________________________________

  James Hitt

    Dalwood, Dorset

   Active among the West Country Baptists since the 1650s, Hitt was also
   associated with the Plymouth church. W.T Whitley asserts that Hitt was
   originally from Axminster. No birth or death dates are available. He is
   listed as a representative of the Plymouth church at the 1692 Assembly.
   The designation "preacher" implies that he was recognized a [214]gifted
   brother.

  Benjamin Keach

    Horse-lie-down, Southwalk

   Benjamin Keach

   (from Spurgeon's original Autobiography (4 volume edition). Scanned by
   P. Johnson, CA)

   Keach originated from Buckinghamshire and worked as a Tailor. He was
   baptized at the age of 15 and began preaching at 18. He was the
   minister of the congregation at Winslow before moving in 1668 to the
   church at Horse-lie-down, Southwark where he remained for 36 years as
   pastor. It was as representative of this church that Keach went to the
   1689 General Assembly and [215]subscribed the 1689 London Baptist
   Confession of Faith. The signing of the confession was no mute
   doctrinal assent on the part of the church, for in the same year they
   entered into a [216]Solemn Covenant which reflects, at the practical
   and congregational level, some of the doctrines of the confession.
   There was a secession from Horse-lie-down in 1673 and the Old Kent Road
   congregation was formed. From this congregation eventually came the New
   Park Street Church where C. H. Spurgeon became the Pastor, later moving
   to the new location at the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Spurgeon
   republished the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith for use in the
   congregation (see [217]What is a Confession of Faith?).

   Keach wrote 43 works, of which his "Parables and Metaphors of
   Scripture" may be the best known. He wrote a work entitled "A Child's
   Instructor" which immediately brought him under persecution and he was
   fined and pilloried in 1664. He is attributed with the writing of a
   Catechism commonly known as "Keach's Catechism", although it is most
   likely that the original was compiled by [218]William Collins. Keach is
   also know to have promoted the introduction of hymn singing in the
   churches. Keach was one of the seven men who sent out the
   [219]invitation to the 1689 General Assembly.

  William Kiffin

    Devonshire Square, London

   William Kiffin

   (from R. Hadyen. English Baptist History and Heritage. Didcot, Oxon:
   The Baptist Union, 1990)

   Kiffin was brought to Christ in his teenage years under the ministry of
   John Goodwin. By 1644 Kiffin had been appointed pastor of the
   Devonshire Square church where he served God until his death in 1701.
   It was from this church that he went as representative to 1689 General
   Assembly and [220]subscribed the 1689 London Baptist Confession of
   Faith.

   Kiffin was a wealthy London merchant with great standing in the
   community and with king Charles II. The king appointed him to public
   office as an alderman of London, a Lord Lieutenant and a magistrate
   though he seldom exercised these offices. Through his influence he was
   able to help many persecuted baptists. His work with [221]Keach and
   [222]Knollys was instrumental in establishing Baptist endeavours in
   Britian. Kiffin was one of the seven men who sent out the
   [223]invitation to the 1689 General Assembly.

  Robert Knight

    Stukeley, Bucks

   A Robert Knight represented the Kensworth Church at several meetings of
   the [224]Abingdon Association in the 1650s. The Kensworth records
   mention both Brother Knight Sr., and Jr. living in Gadsden around 1677.
   It is not known if these men are to be identified with Robert Knight
   from Stukely, Bucks, though this may be possible. He attended both the
   1689 and 1692 Assemblies.

  Hanserd Knollys

    Broken Wharf, London

   Hanserd Knollys

   (from R. Hadyen. English Baptist History and Heritage, Didcot. Oxon:
   The Baptist Union, 1990)

   Knollys was born in Chalkwell, Linconshire, and educated at Cambridge
   University. He was ordained to the priesthood in Church of England in
   1631 and incumbent at Humberstone (Lancashire). Due to his Puritan
   convictions he became a dissenter and resigned his living, moving to
   London. In 1638 he was imprisoned for unlicenced preaching. Being
   allowed to escape he fled to America and established a church in New
   Hampshire. In 1641 he left America and returned to England arriving
   there in December of the same year. By about 1643/44 he had come to
   adopt baptist convictions.

   In London he was instrumental in the formation of a baptist church at
   Great St. Helen's, Bishopsgate. Knollys took part with [225]Kiffin and
   [226]Keach in many baptist endeavours. Knollys was one of the seven men
   who sent out the [227]invitation to the 1689 General Assembly. Two
   years after he had [228]subscribed the 1689 London Baptist Confession
   of Faith, he was called to his Master.

  Isaac Lamb

    Pennington-Street, London

   Son of the General Baptist Thomas Lamb, Isaac was a shoemaker by trade.
   He seems to have died around 1691.

  Edward Man

    Houndsditch, London

   Edward Man seems to have been called to this church in 1687, succeeding
   Henry D'Anvers, and represented it at the 1689 and 1692 General
   Assemblies. He was one of the seven who sent out the [229]letter
   calling for the 1689 General Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  William Phipps

    Exon, Devon

   Phipps became pastor at Exon (Exeter) in 1685. He was present at the
   formation of the Bampton church in 1690, and probably died sometime
   soon after, as the Exon church was represented by Richard Sampson at
   the 1692 Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Christopher Price

    Abergavenny, Monmouth

   This pastor from Wales was actively involved in the discussions at the
   1689 Assembly, signing several of the pronouncements issued at the
   gathering. He was also present at the 1692 General Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Edward Price

    Hereford City, Hereford

   Price was present at both the 1689 and 1692 Assemblies.

  William Prichard

    Blaenau, Monmouth

   William Prichard represented this Welsh church at both the 1689 and
   1692 General Assemblies.

  Richard Ring

    Southampton, Hants

   Ring represented this church at both the 1689 and 1692 General
   Assemblies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Robert Steed

    Broken Wharf, London

   Robert Steed was co-pastor, with [230]Hanserd Knollys, of the Broken
   Wharf church in 1689. In 1692, he was the only representative from his
   church listed in the Narrative. After Knollys' death in 1691, Steed
   continued on as pastor until his own death in 1703.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Richard Sutton

    Tring, Herts

   Sutton must have been young at the 1689 Assembly, as Ivimey includes
   his name in a list of churches and pastors that he based on a collation
   of lists from 1753 and 1763, apparently implying that he was still
   pastor of this church at that time. He was also present in 1692.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Richard Tidmarsh

    Oxford City, Oxon

   Tidmarsh was a representative of the Oxford church at the meeting of
   the [231]Abingdon Association, 11 March, 1656. According to B.R. White,
   he was a tanner and "fairly prominent" in Oxford. In 1691, he was
   ordained pastor of the church in Tiverton, with [232]Thomas Winnel
   present to lay hands on him. He remained at Tiverton until at least
   1704, representing that church at the 1692 Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  John Tomkins

    Abingdon, Berks

   B.R. White gives Tomkins' dates as 1621-1708 (Ivimey has 1632-1708). He
   was active in the [233]Abingdon Association in the 1650s, and was also
   present at the 1692 Assembly. He was a maltster by trade.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Thomas Vaux

    Broadmead, Som. & Glouc.

   The Broadmead, Bristol church, well known through the reprinting of its
   records, was clearly an [234]open membership church. Vaux represented
   the Evershall church at the [235]Abingdon Asscoiation meeting in March
   1653, and was known to be preaching in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire
   in the late 1660s and early 1670s. He was installed as pastor at
   Broadmead in 1687, attended both 1689 and 1692 Assemblies, and died in
   Dec. 1693.
     __________________________________________________________________

  James Webb

    Devizes, Wilts

   Little is known of this man beyond his attendance at the 1689 General
   Assembly. It is possible that he is to be identified with the James
   Webb present at the [236]Western Association meeting in Tiverton in
   1721.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Edmond White

    Evershall, Bedford

   Listed in The Narrative of the Proceedings of the General Assembly as
   Edward White, it is assumed that these are the same individuals. Edmund
   White is known to have been associated with the Evershall church as
   early as 1653, when he and [237]Thomas Vaux were its representatives at
   the [238]Abingdon Association meeting. He seems to have worked closely
   with Benjamin Cox in Association matters. In 1691 he appears in the
   records of the Steventon church, participating in an ordination, and in
   1692 is listed in the Narrative under the name Edmund, still
   representing Evershall.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Toby Willes

    Bridgewater, Somerset

   Toby Willes, or Tobias Wells, was active in the [239]Western
   Association, and signed the Somerset Confession of 1656 as a
   representative of the Bridgewater Church. He was imprisoned for
   non-conformity in 1663. He also attended the 1692 Assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Thomas Winnel

    Taunton, Som. & Glouc.

   A scrivener by trade, and previously a member of a General Baptist
   church, Winnel [sometimes Whinnel] was admitted to membership in the
   Broadmead Church in 1680, after publicly acknowledging his adherence to
   the doctrines of the 1677 London Confession. He was released to serve
   as pastor at Taunton in 1682, representing the church in 1689 and 1692.
   He died in 1720. He was known for his "piety, zeal, and success".

  The Solemn Covenant of the Southwark (Horse-lie-down) Church in 1689.

   [Note: Not all Particular Baptists of the 17th Century agreed with the
   use of Church Covenants]

   "We who desire to walk together in the fear of the Lord, do, through
   the assistance of His Holy Spirit, profess our deep and serious
   humiliation for all our transgressions.

   And we do solemnly, in the presence of God and of each other, in the
   sense of our own unworthiness, give up ourselves to the Lord in a
   church state, according to the apostolic constitution, that He may be
   our God, and we may be His people, through the everlasting covenant of
   His free grace, in which alone we hope to be accepted by Him, through
   His blessed Son Jesus Christ, whom we take to be our High Priest, to
   justify and sanctify us, and our Prophet to teach us; and to be subject
   to Him as our Law-giver, and the King of Saints; and to conform to all
   His holy laws and ordinances, for our growth, establishment, and
   consolation; that we may be as a holy spouse unto Him, and serve Him in
   our generation, and wait for His second appearance, as our glorious
   Bridegroom.

   Being fully satisfied in the way of church-communion, and the truth of
   grace in some good measure upon one another's spirits, we do solemnly
   join ourselves together in a holy union and fellowship, humbly
   submitting to the discipline of the Gospel, and all holy duties
   required of a people in such a spiritual relation.

   1. We do promise and engage to walk in all holiness, godliness,
   humility, and brotherly love, as much as in us lieth to render our
   communion delightful to God, comfortable to ourselves, and lovely to
   the rest of the Lord's people.

   2. We do promise to watch over each other's conversations, and not to
   suffer sin upon one another, so far as God shall discover it to us, or
   any of us; and to stir up one another to love and good works; to warn,
   rebuke, and admonish one another with meekness, according to the rules
   left to us of Christ in that behalf.

   3. We do promise in a special manner to pray for one another, and for
   the glory and increase of this church, and for the presence of God in
   it, and the pouring forth of His Spirit on it, and His protection over
   it to His glory.

   4. We do promise to bear one another's burdens, to cleave to one
   another, and to have a fellow-feeling with one another, in all
   conditions both outward and inward, as God in His providence shall cast
   any of us into.

   5. We do promise to bear with one another's weaknesses, failings, and
   infirmities, with much tenderness, not discovering them to any without
   the Church, nor any within, unless according to Christ's rule, and the
   order of the Gospel provided in that case.

   6. We do promise to strive together for the truth of the Gospel and
   purity of God's ways and ordinances, to avoid causes, and causers of
   division, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
   peace. [Ephesians 4:3].

   7. We do promise to meet together on Lord's-days, and at other times,
   as the Lord shall give us opportunities, to serve and glorify God in
   the way of His worship, to edify one another, and to contrive the good
   of His church.

   8. We do promise according to our ability (or as God shall bless us
   with the good things of this world) to communicate to our pastor or
   minister, God having ordained that they that preach the Gospel should
   live of the Gospel. (And now can anything lay a greater obligation upon
   the conscience than this covenant, what then is the sin of such who
   violate it?)

   These and all other Gospel duties we humbly submit unto, promising and
   purposing to perform, not in our own strength, being conscious of our
   own weakness, but in the power and strength of the blessed God, Whose
   we are, and Whom we desire to serve. To Whom be glory now and for
   evermore. Amen."

  An Annotated Bibliography of Important Reading and Study Materials Concerning
  Particular Baptists

   Belcher, Richard and Anthony Mattia, A Discussion of the Seventeenth
   Century Particular Baptist Confessions of Faith. Southbridge, Mass.:
   Crown Publications, 1990. This book was written to demonstrate that
   there is no evidence to support the theory that the two 17th century
   London Confessions have differing positions on the Law of God. It is
   very well done, and is highly accurate. More could be said on this
   issue to support the conclusion, but this is the best available
   material on this subject.

   Brown, Raymond. The English Baptists of the 18th Century. London: The
   Baptist Historical Society, 1986. This is the best introduction to this
   subject that I have found.

   Copson, Stephen, ed. Association Life of the Particular Baptists of
   Northern England 1699-1732. English Baptist Records, Vol. 3, London:
   The Baptist Historical Society, 1991. This transcript of the records of
   the Northern Association is carefully presented. It illustrates many of
   the ecclesiological perspectives of the Northern Particular Baptists.
   There is an excellent and lengthy introduction which describes many
   facets of their belief and practice. Highly Recommended.

   Estep, William R. The Anabaptist Story. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans
   Pub. Co., 1975 revised edition. For those seeking a readable
   introduction to the Continental Anabaptists, this is the place to
   start. I disagree with Dr. Estep's perspectives on the relations
   between the Continental Anabaptists and the English Baptists, as well
   as his assertions about the theological dependence of the Particular
   Baptists on the General Baptists. Nevertheless, this is a fine
   treatment of the subject.

   Hayden, Roger, ed. The Records of a Church of Christ in Bristol,
   1640-1687. Bristol: The Bristol Record Society, 1974. This work was
   also reprinted twice in the 19th Century. If you can find it, buy it.
   It is living church history. One of the elders of the Broadmead,
   Bristol, Church, Edward Terrill, set down a first hand account of the
   life of his church during this era. Especially interesting is his 12
   step description of the process by which reformation came to Bristol.
   Starting with the events related to Luther and Calvin, he proceeds
   through a series of stages until he arrives at his own church. He
   believed that his own assembly was the logical and theological fruit of
   the reformation. Are Baptists Reformed? This 17th century Baptist knew
   that he was. The Broadmead church was represented at the 1689 General
   Assembly by its pastor [240]Thomas Vaux.

   Haykin, Michael A.G. One Heart and One Soul: John Sutcliff of Olney,
   His Friends and His Times. Darlington, Co. Durham, Evangelical Press,
   1994. Dr. Haykin has written a compelling account of this often
   neglected but highly significant Particular Baptist leader from the end
   of the Eighteenth Century. Sutcliff, along with Andrew Fuller, John
   Ryland Jr., and others, were instrumental in bringing new life into the
   moribund testimony of the Particular Baptists during this era. The wide
   range of subjects handled in the book provides much food for thought in
   our contemporary situation. Very highly recommended.

   [241]Keach, Benjamin. Exposition of the Parables. Series One and Series
   Two. Grand Rapids: Kregel Publications, 1991 reprint.

   Preaching from the Types and Metaphors of the Bible. Grand Rapids:
   Kregel Publications, 1992 reprint. Few works of the 17th Century
   Particular Baptists have been reprinted, and this makes these three
   volumes all the more important. Keach (died 1704) was one of the most
   important, and controversial, pastors among the London churches. These
   works give us much insight into the theological mindset of our
   predecessors. These books should be on the shelf, and in the hands, of
   every Reformed Baptist pastor. You might not always agree with
   everything Keach says, (there are over 1900 pages here), but you will
   learn a great deal about the truly Puritan perspectives of the
   Particular Baptists.

   Lumpkin, W.L. Baptist Confessions of Faith. Valley Forge, Penn.: Judson
   Press, 1969 revised edition. I have a touch of hesitation in
   recommending this book. The documents contained in it are excellent,
   and are worth the price of the volume. Lumpkin's comments, however, are
   not always accurate, and mar the usefulness of the book. I have found
   that he just does not understand the 17th century, and as a result
   makes some serious errors in his statements. His section introducing
   the Second London Confession (1689) contains many mistakes, and has
   been used by some as scholarly support for the notion that the 1689
   Confession's theology was more a matter of political expediency than
   theological conviction. I cannot say strongly enough that this is not
   in any way true. There is substantial agreement between the two London
   Confessions. Two pastors, [242]William Kiffin and [243]Hanserd Knollys,
   signed both. So far as I can tell, they were, in 1689, the only
   surviving subscribers to the 1644 or 1646 editions of the First London
   Confession. More interestingly, of the seven churches that originally
   subscribed in 1644, five had representatives sign the 1689. What about
   the other two? In the decades between, these churches had either died
   out or been assimilated into other churches. Every surviving individual
   and church subscribed the 1689 at the General Assembly. In order to
   support the antinomian theory, one must demonstrate that all of these
   significantly changed their views over those decades. There is no
   evidence to sustain such a notion. So, buy the book for the value of
   its documents, but take Lumpkin's comments with a grain of salt.

   McGoldrick, James Edward. Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in
   Baptist History. Metuchen, N.J.: The American Theological Library
   Association, 1994. This is another must buy book. There is a popular
   notion that true Baptist churches have existed in succession from the
   New Testament era until today. This view is often associated with
   [244]Landmark Baptists, but it also occurs in others as well. Dr.
   McGoldrick, a Baptist professor at Cedarville College, and one who once
   held this view, demonstrates that it is utterly untenable. Most of the
   groups commonly called into the Baptist family bear little or no
   resemblance to what we believe Baptists to be. Some were outright
   heretics, while others were Godly persecuted Christians, but hardly
   Baptists. Dr. McGoldrick does not argue against the perpetuity of the
   church, he simply shows that the notion of Baptist Successionism has no
   historical support. I wish that every Reformed Baptist pastor would get
   this book and read it carefully. I have met several people in different
   churches who have been exposed to the successionist doctrine in one of
   its forms, and have wondered about its validity. This book will help to
   prepare you to give a wise and reasoned pastoral answer to a subject
   that is very delicate with some.

   Nuttall, Geoffrey F. Visible Saints: The Congregational Way 1640-1660.
   Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1957. Dr. Nuttall's book is an excellent
   treatment of the principles of Congregationalism, or Independency,
   during this era. It is well worth careful study.

   Tibbutt, H.G. ed. Some Early Nonconformist Church Books. Bedford: The
   Bedfordshire Historical Record Society, 1972. H.G. Tibbutt has
   transcribed sections of eight 17th Century church books, including two
   important Particular Baptist churches, Kensworth and Stevington. This
   is fascinating reading.

   Tolmie, Murray. The Triumph of the Saints: The Separate Churches of
   London 1616-1649. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977. Tolmie
   provides an excellent background study of the circle of churches out of
   which the Particular Baptists developed.

   Waldron, Samuel E. Baptist Roots in America. Boonton, N.J.: Simpson
   Pub. Co., 1991. A good introduction to the subject.

   Watts, Michael. The Dissenters From the Reformation to the French
   Revolution. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978. This is the best, and most
   comprehensive, treatment of this era. It is not faultless, so be
   careful, but it is very good, especially in its portrayal of historical
   circumstances.

   White, B.R. ed. Association Records of the Particular Baptists of
   England, Wales and Ireland to 1660. 3 Vols. London: The Baptist
   Historical Society, 1971,73,74. Very valuable. These records describe
   the process by which theological and practical issues were hammered out
   among the Particular Baptists. Dr. White's skilled editorial notes make
   the volumes even more valuable. There is also a separate index to these
   volumes, compiled by K.W.H. Howard, published by the B.H.S. in 1977. It
   is of real help in using the material.

   The English Baptists of the 17th Century. London: The Baptist
   Historical Society, 1983. Though brief, this is very helpful. Dr. White
   is probably the world's foremost authority on the English Baptists of
   the 17th century. Sadly, he has suffered a stroke-like injury, and can
   no longer put out the material he once did. His articles on related
   topics, published in many journals and periodicals, are excellent.

   Wilcox, Thomas. Honey Out of the Rock. Pensacola, Fla.: Chapel Library,
   n.d. This sermon by Wilcox, who died in 1687, is one of the few
   Particular Baptist works that are easily obtainable.

DEFINITIONS

   1596 True Confession: This was the Confession of an English separatist
   church, possibly written by its pastor Henry Ainsworth, which was
   published while in exile in Amsterdam.

   Abingdon Association: An association of Particular Baptist Churches
   from Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire,
   Bedfordshire, and Hampshire which began its existence in October, 1652.
   The records of the Association have been reprinted as Vol. 3 of the
   Association Records of the Particular Baptists (London: The Baptist
   Historical Society, 1974).

   Affinity: designates a relationship by marriage.

   Ames, William: (1576-1633) English theologian, educated at Christ's
   College, Cambridge under William Perkins. Exiled in 1610, his writings
   are of immense importance for both English and American Puritanism.

   Annihilationism: In opposition to the Orthodox Christian Doctrine of
   the eternal punishment of the wicked (1689, [246]31 and [247]32),
   Annihilationists are heretics who falsely claim that God punishes
   wicked men by ending their existence (annihilating them), not by
   tormenting them with unending suffering in Hell. Note well that the
   Bible clearly teaches that the error of denying eternal punishment is
   indeed a damning heresy, inconsistent with being a true Christian and
   with going to heaven (Rev. 14:9-11; 20:15; 22:19).

   Asceticism: In oppostition to the Puritan doctrine of the dignity and
   sanctity of Christian marriage, and its propriety for all, even
   Christian ministers (1689, [248]25), the error of Asceticism wrongly
   claims that godliness comes through denying the legitimate appetites of
   the body for food, rest, and sexual fufillment, and therefore, that
   only celibate men and women can achieve the highest levels of
   godliness, and therefore, that all Christian ministers must live a
   celibate life.

   Avouch: to put into words positively and with conviction.

   Clarendon Code, The: A series of 6 penal acts, passed between 1661 and
   1673, intended to re-establish the church of England and punish
   dissenters.

   Commonwealth, The: The period from 1649-1660 when England was ruled by
   Oliver Cromwell and Parliament (Cromwell disbanded Parliament in 1655).

   Consanguinity: designates a blood relationship.

   Conversation: manner or way of life

   Decisionism: In opposition to the Calvinistic doctrine of regeneration,
   or "Irresistible Grace" (1689, [249]10 and [250]20:4), the error of
   dicisionism, building on the error of prevenient grace, claims that a
   some men, of their own free will, use or cooperate with the divine
   enablement of prevenient grace and are saved, while others, also of
   their own free will, choose not to use or to cooperate with God's
   prevenient grace and perish in their sins. Thus, according to the false
   doctrine of decisionism, the decisive factor in the conversion of a
   sinner is the sinner's decision and cooperation, not God's decision and
   regeneration.

   Dispensational Error, The: In opposition to the covenantal doctrine
   (1689, [251]7) that since the fall, God only has one method of saving
   sinners, namely by grace, through faith in Christ, the dispensational
   error falsely claims that God has at times used various methods of
   salvation from sin, specifically, that under the law he saved the Jews
   by their works, and that now, under the gospel, he saves men by grace
   through faith. Note well that I do not mean to offer a general
   definition of what is commonly termed the modern dispensational
   movement. Further, note well, that many Christians today who call
   themselves "Dispensationalists" have properly abandoned and no longer
   hold what I have here termed the dispensational error, which was taught
   by early leaders of that movement and widely propagated by the notes in
   the old Scofield Bible.

   Easy Believism: In opposition to the Orthodox Christian doctrine of
   saving faith and holiness (1689, [252]11:2, and 13), "easy believists"
   (or "carnal Christians") are heretics who falsely claim that their
   verbal assent to the gospel is true and saving faith, even though their
   professed faith is not accompanied by any evangelical repentance toward
   God on their part, and even though their professed faith in Christ does
   not issue in any moral sanctification of their lifestyle.

   Erastianism: In opposition to Baptist doctrine of the separation of
   church and state (1689, [253]25, omission of WC, pgh.4), and to the
   Reformed (Baptist and Paedobaptist) doctrine of the headship of Christ
   over all the churches in every nation under heaven, the universal
   church on earth (1689, [254]26:4), Erastianism wrongly asserts that the
   King of England, rather than the Pope of Rome, is the head of the
   universal church in England. Accordingly, the "Church of England"
   wrongly recognizes this false royal claim to ecclesiastical headship.
   Thus, in general terms, Erastianism promotes the erroneous notion that
   the head of state in each nation has authority to act as the head of
   the churches in that nation.

   Gifted Brethren: A controversy arose in the 17th Century over who was
   properly eligible to preach and teach in the churches. Presbyterians
   argued that the office of preaching and teaching was limited to the
   ordained clergy, while most Independents and Baptists argued that it
   must not be confined in this way. The Particular Baptists resolved the
   problem by recognizing that some men were given gifts of ministry by
   Christ, though they were not necessarily to be called into full-time
   ministry. If it was suspected that a man might have such gifts, he
   would be asked to preach to the church in private, and if approved,
   would then be permitted to preach in public. These were the "gifted
   brethren". This issue is described in [255]Chapter 26, Paragraph 11 of
   the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith. Some of these gifted
   brethren later were called into the ministry, while others were not.

   Health-Wealth: In opposition to the Puritan doctrine that spiritual
   blessings and graces are the distinctive mark of God's people under the
   new covenant (1689, [256]10 - [257]20), the Health-wealth movement
   erroneously believes that physical health and material prosperity
   always distinguish those who please God.

   Impugn: call into question, challenge

   Insuperable: that which cannot be overcome or got over.

   Landmarkism: In opposition to the Reformed (Baptist and Paedobaptist)
   doctrine of the church universal (1689, [258]26:1, [259]2), the error
   of Landmarkism denies the existence of any universal church on earth.

   Libertarian: In opposition to the Puritan doctrine of the Christian
   Sabbath (1689, [260]22:7, [261]8), the Libertarian error claims that
   the observance of the Lord's day as a day of rest and worship is a
   matter of Christian liberty, not a matter of Christian duty or moral
   obligation.

   Oaths: solemn promises made before the Lord, but to men.

   Open/Closed Membership: A strong dispute arose in the 1660s and 1670s
   over the necessity of believer baptism for membership in a local
   church. Some churches, such as John Bunyan's Bedford church, and Henry
   Jessey's London church, argued that it was unnecessary, and are thus
   called "open-membership" churches. Others, like [262]William Kiffin,
   [263]Hanserd Knollys, and [264]Benjamin Keach, were pastors of
   "closed-membership" churches. The vast majority of Particular Baptist
   churches were closed membership, although the Broadmead, Bristol
   Church, which sent representatives to the 1689-92 General Assemblies,
   and whose pastor, [265]Thomas Vaux subscribed the Confession in 1689,
   was open-membership.

   Pietism: In opposition to the Puritan doctrine of the propriety of
   Christian involvement in civic, political, and military activity (1689,
   [266]24), the error of Pietism wrongly asserts that gospel holiness
   mandates that a Christian withdraw from any involvement in political,
   civic, or military action.

   Prevenient Grace: In opposition to the Calvinistic doctrine of total
   inability (1689, [267]6 and [268]9), the error of prevenient grace
   claims that God, by an act of "prevenient grace", removes the moral
   disability and bondage to indwelling sin from all men, and thus morally
   enables all men to come to Christ in repentance and faith. This error
   serves as the foundation for the companion error of Decisionism.

   Propitiation: the turning away of the wrath of God by sacrifice.

   Protectorate, The: The period from 1653-58 during which Oliver Cromwell
   was known as the Lord Protector.

   Restoration of 1660: The return of King Charles II from exile.

   Sovereign Grace: The Sovereign Grace movement, although it openly
   adheres to Orthodox Christian, Calvinist, and Baptistic doctrines,
   nevertheless errs in its opposition to the open confession of the
   1689's covenantal teaching, ecclesiastical polity, and Puritanism,
   especially, its Puritan doctrines of the regulative principle and
   Christian Sabbath (1689, [269]22:1, [270]7 ,[271]8). Note well, that
   while some advocates of the Sovereign Grace movement personally hold to
   the1689, the distinctive beliefs of the Sovereign Grace movement are
   defined, not by the 1689 Confession, but by a fifteen point doctrinal
   statement, which does not adhere to the 1689's Covenantal (1689,
   [272]7), Puritan (1689, [273]10 -- [274]20, [275]22), and Savoy Church
   Polity (1689, [276]26:5 -- [277]15) distinctives. Practically
   speaking,. if we replace the 1689 Confession with the 15 point
   Sovereign Grace doctrinal statement, the result will be the watering
   down of the things most surely believed among us, by eliminating
   covenant theology, Puritanism, and Savoy polity from our defining and
   distinctive beliefs as Reformed Baptists.

   Supererogate: to do over and above what God requires or expects. In
   Roman Catholic theology supererogate works are meritorious and can
   avail for the benefit of others (eg. in the case of saints).

   Theonomy: In opposition to the Puritan doctrine of the priority of
   experiential religion and spiritual things, both in the Christian life
   and in the Christian church (1689, [278]10 - [279]20), the theonomy
   movement errs by pursuing the priority of societal religion and
   material things. Their wrong priorities are based on their erroneous
   belief that the prime mandate of Christians and churches is to move
   their society to adopt and implement Mosaic moral and civil law in
   every realm, whether political, sociological, economic, cultural,
   educational, judicial, or religious. Accordingly, in opposition to the
   biblical doctrine that God's kingdom is spiritual and ecclesiastical,
   and comes when Christians and Christian churches keep God's law
   evangelically, Theonomists erroneously think that God's kingdom, or
   rule, is national, and comes when a whole society formally adopts God's
   law in its national life. Accordingly, Theonomists typically, yet
   vainly, hope for materialistic millennium (Theonomic
   Postmillennialism), in which every nation in the world, as a society,
   for an extended period of time, approximately 1000 years, adopts and
   implements God's moral and civil law in every realm of its national
   life.

   Universalism: In opposition to the Orthodox Christian Doctrine of the
   eternal punishment of the wicked (1689, [280]31 and [281]32),
   universalists are heretics who falsely claim that all men, even
   atheists, go to heaven, and that here is no such thing as hell or
   eternal punishment. Note that the word "universalism" sometimes refers
   to a similar but distinct error, not a damning heresy, held by some
   Christians, namely, the erroneous notion that all God does with a view
   to salvation from sin he does to and for all men alike. I refer here,
   not to evangelical universalism, but to heretical universalism.

   Vows: solemn promises made to the Lord.

   Vulgar: common or every day

   Vouchsafed: given or granted in a condescending or gracious manner.

   Western Association, The: An association of churches in the western
   counties, including Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Cornwall, Somerset &
   Devon which began its existence in Nov. 1653. The records of the
   Association have been reprinted as Vol. 2 of the Association Records of
   the Particular Baptists (London: The Baptist Historical Society, 1973).

  About the Electronic Text

   This electronic version of the 1677/89 London Baptist Confession of
   Faith has been transcribed from a microfilm copy of an original 1677
   Confession. All the old english and even misspelled words have been
   retainined in an attempt to produce a near facimile to the original
   text. Although the Confession was published in 1677, it was done so
   anonymously due to the persecution of the times. It was not until 1689,
   after the "Glorious Revolution" under William and Mary of Orange that
   this Confession was published with the names of the [282]subscribers
   and the churches they represented attached and has become known as the
   1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith or the Second London Baptist
   Confession of Faith. (See also the sections on [283]Origins of the
   Confession and the [284]Historical and Theological background of the
   Confession for more details).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Why The 1677/89 BCF Assistant?

   Over the last few decades there has been an increasing interest in and
   adherence to the London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689. This is in
   stark contrast to a contemporary church scene in which many feel that
   Christian doctrine is unimportant. There has been a returning to the
   "old ways and plain paths in which dwelleth righteousness" and a desire
   to "know the truth" that the truth might set us free.

   The 1677/89 BCF Assistant was written with the desire to aid this
   interest in the London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1677/89 by
   placing it in a computer readable form. The hypertexting environment
   seemed to me a convenient way to have the text of the Confession and
   the Word of God linked so that the text of the Confession could be
   directly compared to the Word of God.

   I have chosen to use the text of the Confession with citations to the
   King James Version of the Bible (KJV) for two reasons:

   (1) The KJV was the one in common use at the time of the writing of the
   Confession and therefore would best represent the citations to the
   Scriptures made in it; and

   (2) Both these texts are public domain and can be copied without breach
   of copyright (as far as I am aware).

   It is my prayer that The 1677/89 BCF Assistant will assist you in your
   study of God's Word and help you rediscover the great Biblical
   doctrines which brought about the Reformation and the great days of the
   Puritans.
