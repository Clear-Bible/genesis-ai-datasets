INTRODUCTION

   The Greek Church is little known in the West, and it would seem as if
   there were little desire on our part to alter that state of things. The
   causes which have led to this indifference are many and not easily
   traced, but there are two which may be briefly referred to as being,
   perhaps, the chief.

   The first of these is the inherent peculiarity of temperament which
   finds its expression in habits of thought and modes of action in the
   East, against which the spirit of the West frets and for which it has
   neither sympathy nor toleration. The quiet, meditative restfulness, the
   satisfaction with past attainment in doctrine and worship, the wistful
   retrospective gaze upon magnificent accomplishment, which the
   experiences of centuries of trial have only intensified,--these are
   totally alien to the active, speculative, hopeful spirit of the West.

   The other is the great Roman Church. Inspired with the spirit which
   commends itself to the Western mind,--its activity, its aptitude to fit
   itself to the ever-changing circumstances of the times, its progressive
   spirit, and thirst for achievement,--that Church, for the past nine
   centuries, has obtruded itself upon our attention, and claimed, nay,
   demanded, our consideration. It pervades the West; its advocates are
   ubiquitous; its influence is everywhere felt. We are out of touch with
   the East; the Greek Church fades from our view,--out of sight it is out
   of mind, and it is the Roman Church that bars our vision.

   Needless to say, the Greek Church deserves better at our hands than to
   be thus forgotten. Do we forget that the Fathers of that Church
   formulated our doctrines and shaped our creed; that the creed framed at
   Nicea is practically our creed; that the churches founded by the
   Apostles still hold by Apostolic doctrine, and are parts of that great
   Church; and that, in unbroken succession, from the dawn of Christianity
   down to the present time, the bishops have handed on the torch of
   truth? We reap the blessing of Eastern fidelity to Christian truth, and
   forget, or ignore, the source whence it came to us.

   Prior to the Great Schism in A.D. 1054, Christendom in East and West
   was practically one. The causes which led to that separation--fraught
   with such momentous and far-reaching issues, not only for Christianity,
   but also for the nations of the East--cannot be dwelt upon here.
   Suffice it to say that the estrangement found its completion when, in
   1054, the addition of the word Filioque to the Latin Creed by which the
   Roman See expressed its adherence to the double procession of the Holy
   Ghost,--from the Father, and the Son, a doctrine against which the
   Greek Church had repeatedly protected,--supplied the ground for a
   renewal of the quarrel, which resulted, this time, in separation
   complete and final, Pope Leo IX excommunicating Michael Cerularius,
   Patriarch of Constantinople.

   In 1453 the Turk entered Constantinople, and the history of the Greek
   Empire was closed: but not that of the Church. She accepted the change
   of conditions imposed upon her, and when her temples were despoiled,
   and her worship profaned, still held to the Faith. Now that the Ottoman
   rule is gone, let us hope for ever, the prospect brightens, and the
   suffering Church, which has so nobly maintained the conflict, will
   doubtless reap her reward; and not in those dominions only, but also
   over the vast extent of Russia, when the sorely tried people of that
   late empire shall have emerged from the present welter in blood.

   The Greek Church, in its Orthodox and Heretical divisions, comprises,
   among others, those peoples who speak the Greek and Slavic tongues. The
   Russian Church includes the peoples of that vast dominion. Christianity
   was first preached to them shortly before the Schism of 1054, and their
   conversion marks the greatest conquest of Christianity since the days
   of the Apostles. It was that great event which laid the foundation of
   Russia's subsequent greatness; and our hope for that interesting people
   lies in their warm religious temperament, and the Christian element
   that has entered their life, which have been fostered not alone in
   years of prosperity, but through centuries of oppression; and in these
   days in the midst of horrors to which the experiences of earlier Greek
   Christians alone afford a parallel.

   In the ninth century commercial relations with Constantinople brought
   the Slavic people in contact with Eastern Christianity. Kiev became a
   centre of influence. Later, under the rule of Vladimir, who had become
   a devoted convert, Greek missionaries carried the Cross into Russia,
   preaching the Christian Faith to the people in their own language. The
   result was phenomenal. Churches, schools, monasteries were built, and
   were soon filled. For a century after the Schism of 1054 the Russian
   Church continued its connection with the See of Rome, but later resumed
   its old allegiance to the Patriarch of Constantinople.

   The error has got abroad that the Russian Church is not really Greek,
   but only akin to it. This is a pure fiction; there is no Slavic Church;
   the Church in Russia has always been, and still is, essentially Greek.

   Early in the fourteenth century the first Russian Patriarch was
   consecrated, although the Church continued for some time longer to look
   to the Patriarchs of Constantinople for guidance: and about the same
   time the Metropolitan See was transferred to Moscow, and relationship
   to the state established. In the reign of Peter the Great the
   patriarchate was suppressed, and the Holy Governing Synod took its
   place. This Synod, which has never changed its constitution, consists
   of the Metropolitans of Moscow, Kiev, and Petrograd, the Exarch of
   Georgia, and other prelates, the number of which is not limited. The
   Czar had the right to nominate six other dignitaries, as well as the
   principal chaplain to the forces, and his own private chaplain. A
   change of constitution will, however, now be necessary, and it will be
   interesting to learn what it will be.

   The Service books from which the hymns in this volume are taken were,
   early in the history of the Russian Church, translated into Slavic. On
   account, however, of the separation and long distance from
   Constantinople, and for other reasons, many interpolations and not a
   few errors crept into these books, and continual revision had to be
   undertaken. The result is that at the present time the Russian Church
   has an excellent translation of the Greek Offices, in language clear
   enough, and simple enough, to be understood by all, even by the
   illiterate peasantry.

   In these books the hymns with which we deal are to be found. Fully
   two-thirds of their contents are hymnodical; and as there are seventeen
   quarto volumes, closely printed, the extent of the praise material of
   the Russian Church can be imagined,--a veritable thesaurus, and
   practically unknown to the Churches of the West. They are written in
   rhythmical prose, in which metre and quantity are ignored, accent alone
   being observed. Commas are used, not to mark the sense, but to indicate
   the musical notation, much as we employ the colon in prose Psalms
   prepared for chanting. An exception to this rule is found in a few
   hymns by St. John of Damascus, which are in iambics. The hymns of the
   earliest Greek Christian poets, of which a very few are included in
   this volume, are not found in the Office books, and are consequently
   not used in canonical worship. The praise is conducted by a choir of
   Singers, who are ordained to their office; or, in the event of the
   service being lengthy, recited by a Reader, who is likewise ordained.
   No instrumental accompaniment is permitted.

   The hymns of the Office books have a variety of characteristics, and
   are distinguished by terms the meaning of which is in most cases
   extremely vague, and in others to be derived from the subject of the
   hymn, or from the form, or it may be from the time, place, or manner,
   in which it is sung. As we have no corresponding words in our language
   for most of these it is necessary to retain the originals.

   The Canon is the most elaborate form into which the praise of the
   Church is cast. A Canon consists nominally of nine Odes, for the reason
   that there are nine scriptural canticles employed at Lauds, viz. The
   Song of Moses after crossing the Red Sea, The Song of Moses in Deut.
   xxxii.; The Songs of Hannah, Habakkuk, Isaiah, Jonah, The Three
   Children (first part, and second part), Mary (Magnificat), Simeon (Nunc
   dimittis).

   As reference is made in each Ode to the canticle of the same number,
   e.g. in the sixth Ode to Jonah's prayer in the whale's belly, a
   considerable amount of ingenuity has been expended to secure the
   reference. The effect in some cases, as may be fancied, is somewhat
   grotesque, but it is remarkable with what skill it has in so many cases
   been accomplished.

   The Hirmos is the first stanza of the Ode. It may or may not have a
   relation to the stanzas following, for its function is to give them
   their rhythmical model.

   Troparia are the stanzas which follow the Hirmos. There are usually
   three in an Ode, but the number may exceed that. The term is probably
   derived from the verb (trepo) to turn: the Troparia turn to the
   strophes of the Hirmos as to a model.

   Scattered over the Canon is a variety of verses variously named. The
   Kathisma occurs after the third or sixth Ode. The verse is sung during
   a pause in the service (kathizo).

   Hypacóe occur after the third Ode; Kontakia, another obscure term,
   after the sixth Ode. Each Ode is followed by a Theotokion (theotokos,
   God-bearing), a Troparion dedicated to the Virgin Mother. In some cases
   a stanza depicting her at the Cross follows, called the
   Staurotheotokion. The Icos follows the Kontakion after the sixth Ode.
   Stichera are a series of verses, in some cases taken from the Psalter.
   The Idiomelon, unlike the Troparion, follows no model. The
   Exapostilarion is a verse sung between certain Psalms by one of the
   clergy, who is sent (exapostello) from his place among the choir down
   to the middle of the Church, for that purpose.

   The hymns of this collection are, as the title describes
   them,--Translations or Renderings, Centos and Suggestions. It is in
   their suggestiveness that the chief attraction of Greek hymns lies. By
   the ordinary process of translation, the harmony which they present in
   the original language and setting, and the combined effect of metaphor
   and symbol in which they abound, are apt to be lost. It is by capturing
   the subtle suggestion of the original, and utilizing it to the best
   advantage in our more matter of fact language, that the value of the
   original is made appreciable. Objectiveness, which is the prominent
   mark of these hymns, enables us to do for ourselves what less wholesome
   subjective hymns aim at doing for us, and not always successfully; it
   presents a picture,--an icon in words, and if the worshipper be not
   hopelessly blind, he sees it, and the impression is made upon the mind
   and heart, with the desired result in varying degrees. It is this that
   makes the hymns of the Service books so suggestive, and hence the
   result of a reminiscence of the original is usually subjective. In the
   Suggestions included in this collection the original is used as a
   basis, a theme, a motive; oriental colour and some of its warmth are,
   it is hoped, preserved. Now and again an oriental figure is retained,
   and to those who have any acquaintance with the worship of the Eastern
   Church it must be obvious that the peculiar themes of her praise are in
   abundant evidence.

   What, then, is the net result? To an unpractised eye, if no indication
   of the source of these hymns had been given, could anything about them
   have suggested their source? To the unpractised eye, nothing. But no
   one who knows the Greek Offices will travel far before he overtakes
   well-known landmarks. This is just as it should be. It is sufficient
   that a fertile source of suggestion has been found--of theme, thought,
   form, colour--and that from this ancient source it is possible to
   procure much that is beautiful for the adornment of the worship of
   God's house to-day. And this gratifying fact is made plain, that the
   themes of Greek praise are the themes of the praise of the Church in
   our land, and in all Christian lands;--The Christ in all the might and
   glory of His Person and Work; the need of our humanity, and the way in
   which Christ met it; His miraculous birth, which is not shorn of any of
   its mystery, and the embellishments of the event, which are never toned
   down, but, in true oriental fashion, made, if possible, more dazzling;
   His Passion and Death, and the fullness, of their atoning efficacy.
   But, as is to be expected, the grand theme of the Greek singers, as
   became those who, more than we have done, caught the first inspiration
   of their praise from the Apostles, is the glorious Resurrection of our
   Lord from the dead. Here the praise of the Greek Church touches its
   highest note and pours forth its most enchanting melody. "Christ is
   risen," and the glad response, "He is risen indeed,"--these words
   constitute the keynote of all that is best and most beautiful in Greek
   worship. The Knowledge and the Wisdom of God are everywhere extolled,
   and the attribute of Light is continually and cordially applied to the
   Deity.

   In most cases initial Greek headlines have been omitted from the hymns
   of this collection for the reason that they can serve no useful
   purpose, nor indicate with any certainty the source of any particular
   hymn.

   The foregoing Introduction to our subject has been deemed indispensable
   in view of the scanty information possessed by our people relative to
   the great Church of the East. The hymns must speak for themselves. May
   they be as a gift from a deeply suffering Church to many sad hearts in
   our own land--saddened by the events of the cruel war from which we
   have just emerged, thank God, victorious. If the comfort which many of
   them breathe should help to soothe the wounds of our sorrow, the Church
   from which it proceeds will only be continuing the office which she has
   so nobly fulfilled to her own suffering people during the past six
   centuries, and which she herself so sorely needs in these days of
   oppression and bloodshed.

   The rosy-fingered dawn appears,

   And lo, the sun uprise;

   His shafts like golden pointed spears

   Illume the brightening skies;--

   Up, soul of mine, in beauty shine,

   And praise the Lord of Light divine.


   Thou hast a task to do this day,

   Thy God to serve in all;

   Like morn and noon thy light display,

   Ere night in darkness fall.--

   Up, soul of mine, in beauty shine,

   And praise the Lord of Light divine.


   The rosy morn shall fade away,

   The sun his course complete;

   Thy task must end with close of day,

   When light and darkness greet.--

   Up, soul of mine, in beauty shine,

   And praise the Lord of Light divine.


   Eternal light eternal glows,

   Beyond the realms of time;

   Where service still to service grows,

   As suns to noontide climb.--

   Up, soul of mine, in beauty shine,

   And praise the Lord of Light divine.

   Triple beam of glory

   Through the darkness poured;

   One the Light eternal

   In our blessed Lord:

   Give us in the morning

   Gladness for the day,

   All our life adorning,

   Chase our night away.


   Glory to the Father,

   Glory to the Son,

   Glory to the Spirit,

   Blessed Three in One:

   Let Thy beams united,

   Brighter than the sun,

   Lighten men benighted,

   Blessed Three in One.


   Men in darkness sitting

   Scan the eastern skies;

   Glory of the Father,

   On their night arise;

   Give the morn supernal,

   Give the endless day;--

   Light of lights, eternal,

   Chase their night away.


   Hearts are dark with sorrow,

   Minds are dull with care;

   Clouds of doubt envelop

   Mankind everywhere;

   Triple beam of gladness,

   Through the ages poured,

   Give us joy for sadness,-

   Shine upon us, Lord.

   St. Gregory, 4th Century


   The morning breaks, I place my hand in Thine,

   My God, 'tis Thine to lead, to follow mine;

   No word deceitful shall I speak the while,

   Nor shall I stain my hand with action vile.


   Thine be this day with worthy labour filled,

   Strong let me stand to do the duty willed;

   Nor swayed by restless passion would I be,

   That I may give the offering pure to Thee;


   Else were I shamed when hoary age I see,

   Shamed were this board that bears Thy gifts to me:

   Mine is the impulse; O my Christ, I pray,

   Be Thou Thyself to me the Blessed Way.

   When the morning from the skies

   Pours on earth its glorious rays,

   Up, my soul, from slumber rise,

   Give the God of light thy praise.


   When the earth with beauty decked,

   Spreads her verdant mantle broad,

   Let thy garb the hues reflect

   Of the holiness of God.


   While the sun his course fulfils

   Till the shining day is done,

   For the task His wisdom wills,

   Gird thee till the goal is won.


   Every morn of every day

   Heed the voice of God that calls;

   Swiftly His behests obey

   Ere the silent darkness falls.


   Day is passing, night is near,--

   Life is but a day at best;

   Serve Thy God with holy fear,

   If the night would bring you rest.

   The Morning dawns; on gilded height

   The glory of the early light

   Awaits the rising sun

   Awake, my soul, to life awake!

   Inspired with hope thy task o'ertake,

   And fill the day begun.


   O Light, beyond our utmost light,

   To Whom our day is as the night,

   Our sun a feeble star;

   Lead me to where Thy glories rise,

   Beyond the earth, beyond the skies,

   On fairer fields afar.


   Thou art the Light, eternal Christ,

   Whose glory at the first sufficed

   To fire the endless spheres;

   Night has no more abiding place,

   Before the brightness of Thy face

   The darkness disappears.


   O that a searching ray would shine

   Within this darkened soul of mine,

   And bid my night depart!

   Then would the joy of life abound,

   And morning music ever sound

   Within my joyless heart.

   Awake, my soul, creation wakes;

   And while the purple tints the skies,

   Prepare for God thy sacrifice.


   Thanks to my God, my best of friends,

   For all the care His love extends;

   For rest, and peace, and waking eyes

   To view the light that fills the skies.


   Let sleep my waking eyes forsake;

   From sloth my soul her pinions shake;

   And may the light that gladdens all,

   Illume my task till evening fall.


   O Christ, my Morning star, my Light,

   With Thee no dread infects the night;

   May darkness ne'er my life appal

   Nor night, at noon-tide, darkly fall.


   Bring me where morn eternal shines,

   And light, unfailing, life entwines;

   Where darkness ne'er its clouds unrolls

   To charge with dread our fearful souls.


   To Thee, O Christ, be endless praise,

   O Morning star, my joy always;

   Be aye my morn, for ever shine,

   And fill my soul with peace divine.

   Walk, the while ye have the light.


   Haste! the daylight may forsake thee

   Ere thou reach thy journey's goal;

   Lest the solemn night o'ertake thee,

   Up! the shining hours control.


   Do the task that waits thy doing;

   Let the will of God be thine;

   Ever what is right pursuing,

   Till the day to night decline.

   In my soul in beauty shine;

   Then, the dread of night forgetting,

   I shall live in light divine.

   See, in the darkness, the dawn is awaking,

   Shafts from the sunrise are piercing the gloom,

   Night in her mantle the earth is forsaking,

   Heaven gives its glory, and nature her bloom.


   Wake from thy slumber, O soul: it is morning;

   Rise to the tasks which the morning prepares;

   Fair be thy garments, a sunlight adorning,

   Fairer than earth in the morning light wears.


   Morning or night, if the clouds are depressing,

   Sunlight or starlight shut out from the view;

   Light of my life! may the calm of Thy blessing

   Fall on my soul as the comforting dew.


   Light of my soul! where Thy Presence is beaming,

   Night cannot come though the clouds may obscure;

   Fill Thou my soul, and the dark is but seeming,

   Shadows may flit, but Thy light shall endure.


   See, in the darkness, the dawn is awaking,--

   Soul, it is morning: in worship adore;

   Fall at His feet, all the evil forsaking,

   Live in the light of the Christ ever more.

   Shines upon the earth below;

   And the fields in bright array,

   Spread their beauty in its glow;--

   Jesus, Lord, when noon controls,

   May Thy beauty grace our souls.


   Weary, when the noon oppressed,

   Thou didst rest upon the well,

   And a sinning soul was blest,

   As Thy words divinely fell;--

   Lord, Thy living water give,

   That our thirsting souls may live.


   Once at noon, a midnight dread

   Blotted out the earth and sky,

   For the God-man bowed His head,

   And creation saw Him die;--

   May Thy death our dying be,

   May we rise, O Christ, with Thee.


   In Thy realm of light above,

   Rising suns, nor setting, shine;

   Synesius, 4th Century


   When darkness falls, and night is here,

   My hymns of praise in silence rise,--

   This knows the moon, whose silver sphere

   Shines in the star bespangled skies.


   When morning breaks, and glorious day

   Shines in the dawn and noontide fair,--

   Springs from my heart in fervent prayer,

   The sun has reached his western goal,

   And night-winds hush the world to rest;

   Be still, and worship God, my soul,

   Who through the day thy life hath blest.


   To God thy Maker thanks accord,

   For life, and hope, and every good;

   And all the comfort of His Word

   Incarnate, for the spirit's food.


   Ah, night is dark when clouds of guilt

   The shrinking soul with fears distress;

   Call on the Christ Whose blood was spilt,

   And all thy guiltiness confess.


   Then let me rest in calm repose,--

   Secure in Him my rest is sweet;

   The fears of night no dread impose,

   If I have worshipped at His feet.


   O Christ, Who art my Light, I pray,

   Keep Thou my soul till morning shine;

   Then, brighter than the orb of day,

   Illume my path with light divine.

   When all the world was sleeping;

   And beauty smote the dancing rills,

   And gladness chased our brooding ills,

   And set our hearts a-leaping.


   Then high at noon the sun looked down

   Upon our care and fretting,

   The while we trod the path of life,

   In ease or toil, in pain or strife,

   Remembering or forgetting.


   And now 'tis eve, and solemn night

   Its curtain spreads above us;--

   O God, in mercy let us rest,

   Assured that all in life is best,

   If Thou, our Father, love us.

   Light upon our gloom arising,

   Herald of the perfect day;

   Night, and all its powers despising,

   Hail we now Thy glorious ray.


   From the home of light excelling,

   Comes He forth in raiment bright,

   Stealing to the noisome dwelling

   Of the denizen of night.


   To the hopeless, bound and sighing,

   Held in darkness as a snare,

   Comes He forth, their bands untying,

   Giving hope for gaunt despair.


   To the faithless, faint and failing,

   Leaning on a staff that breaks,--

   Kindling lights all unavailing,--

   Lo, the Light of lights awakes.


   To the fearful heart in sorrow,

   Tossed upon a troubled sea,

   Comes that Light as on the morrow

   When He walked on Galilee.

   Would we lift our eyes to Thee;

   From the bliss of Heaven descending,

   Come, our souls from dying free.

   Behold the King of Zion rides,

   But not in vain array;

   The people wave their goodly palms,

   With garments strew the way;

   And loud hosannas fill the air

   From crowds that, surging, throng;--

   'Tis meet to honour Him Who rides,

   With cheer, and shout, and song.


   O Zion of your God beloved,

   The day of strife is nigh,

   Yet comes He not in armour clad,

   And sword upon His thigh;

   The weapons of our mighty King

   No other hand could wield,

   The might of God is in His arm,

   The will of God His shield.


   See, on the Cross without the wall

   The King immortal dies;

   Not now hosannas fill the air,--

   The shouts of hell arise;

   But in that hour of triumph deemed,

   Satanic might is slain,

   For He Who bows the head in death,

   Shall rise to life again.


   O Zion, hail your mighty King;

   Your palms around Him wave;

   And strew your garments in the way

   Of Him Who rides to save;

   And when He mounts His regal throne,

   By bloody conflict won,

   Give homage to the King of heaven,

   God's One Eternal Son.

   He mounts a throne with purple spread,

   That issues from His wounded side,

   And prickly thorns encrown His head,

   In mockery of His kingly pride.


   O people, blinded are your eyes,

   The Gift of God you have not known;

   And now the hope of ages dies,

   And lo, the guilt is all your own.


   Strew palms, strew palms, He comes again,

   A King to reign, and not to die;

   Hosannas shout in loud refrain,

   To rise re-echoing to the sky.


   But, not enough, before Him fall,

   His kingly grace repenting claim;

   And He shall hear your humble call,

   Above the shouting and acclaim.


   Strew palms, strew palms! O Christ our King,

   To Thee our fealty now we give,

   "Watch with Me," the Master said,

   And the night around Him fell,

   While the snares of sin and hell

   On His awful path were spread.


   But they slumbered while He prayed;

   They who were His constant care,

   Heard no echo of His prayer,

   When His soul was sore dismayed.


   Then He held the cup of woe,

   And the prayer to God was made;--

   Thrice in agony He prayed,

   That He might the draught forgo.


   But the will of God was done,

   In the garden, on that night,

   And He rose in all the might

   Of the Well-beloved Son.


   Ah, my soul, thy Lord behold;--

   Wake from slumber, hear Him pray,

   All thy griefs are borne away,

   By His agony, untold.


   And the strength of God is thine

   When the will of God is done

   In obedience, as a son,

   Conscious of a love divine.

   The Christ of God in anguish prayed;--

   And who that agony could tell,

   As from His brow the blood-drops fell?


   "Can ye not watch one hour?" He saith,--

   "My soul is sorrowful to death."

   But He alone the vigil kept,

   While worn disciples slumbering slept.


   O dark the cloud that threatening hung,

   And sore the grief His soul that wrung;--

   The hate of man, the guilty name,

   The bitter Cross, the sin and shame.


   "If I must drink this cup," He prayed,

   "The burden bear upon Me laid,

   My God, I bow Me to Thy will,

   And meekly Thy behest fulfil."


   My soul! when to the garden led,

   And clouds are gathering overhead;

   When none the hour of anguish shares,

   To God direct thy earnest prayers.


   "Thy will be done, Thy will is best,"--

   And then the bitter cup is blest,

   If for His will the cup I drain,

   Despite the agony and pain.

   The solemn feast was spent,

   And night had spread her pall,

   When Christ with His disciples went

   Beyond the city wall;

   And in the dark He led the way,

   Towards the lone Gethsemane.


   He took His chosen three,

   And bowed with grief He saith,

   "Abide ye here, and watch with me,

   I sorrow unto death";

   Then, moving forward still a pace,

   He fell in prayer upon His face.


   Ah, ill their watch they keep,

   For soon their eyelids close,

   And when their Lord returned, in sleep

   Those weary men repose;

   "Awake," He said, "make prayerful call,

   Lest ye before the tempter fall."


   Thrice did the Master pray,

   That God His Son would save;

   But heaven in silence turned away,

   And earth no comfort gave;

   And still the worn disciples slept

   While Christ alone the vigil kept.


   O soul of mine, awake!

   Cast off thy careless sleep;

   To God Thy prayer for succour make

   And earnest vigil keep;

   And learn, whate'er His will may be,

   To do that will is best for thee.

   When He to judgement shall arise,

   And forth the summons send,--

   And smite Him on the face,

   'Though by Himself the hands were made,

   Thus sullied with disgrace;

   He, Who Immortal Life bestows,

   When, on the Cross forsaken, hung

   He Who had shared their life below.


   All hail, the Christ! Immortal Thou!

   Death and the grave are conquered quite;

   Gone is the power that held us, now,

   Gone are the terrors of the night.

   Awake, arise, and greet the dawning day,

   See, on the hills, the morning beams are shed;

   Wipe from your eyes the tears of grief away,

   For lo, the Christ is risen, Who was dead.


   Awake, arise, nor seek the empty tomb,

   He is not there, Who died by cruel men;

   But, as the sun that rises from the gloom,

   He hath arisen, nor sets in night again.


   Woeful the day when sin and death assailed,

   Day died at noon, and hope despairing fled;

   Long was the night, but morning hath prevailed,

   Sin is o'erthrown, and death itself is dead.


   Awake, arise, and as the angel throng

   Welcomed the Christ on earth, in weakness born,

   Break into praise, and with triumphant song

   Welcome the dawning of a fairer morn.

   Christ hath left the dismal tomb;--

   Glory, Glory, He is risen;

   Like a cloud hath passed the gloom,

   As a dream, the prison.


   From the Cross they bore Him there,

   Torn and bleeding, and they wound Him

   In soft linen white and fair,

   And sweet fragrance round Him.


   Christ hath left the dismal tomb;--

   Glory, glory, death is lying

   In the everlasting gloom,

   From the conflict dying.


   And His weeping followers came

   From their hiding, and they sought Him,

   Whither loving hands, in shame,

   Sad and sorrowing, brought Him.


   Christ hath left the dismal tomb;--

   Glory, glory, He is risen;

   Death has heard the voice of doom

   In the empty prison.


   And they sought the living there;

   Weeping eyes, the morn is waking;

   With the light give wings to care,

   Night and death forsaking.

   The gate of life stands wide,

   For Christ hath entered in;

   Now fearless mount the upward path,

   Nor dread the power of sin;

   For sin and death are slain

   By Him Who rose again.


   'Twas on the Cross He died,

   And death a victory won;

   Short-lived as night that flies before

   The rising of the sun;

   For death by Christ was slain,

   Who died to live again.


   The might of sin prevailed,--

   Its cruel hate and scorn;

   It drove the cruel spear and nails,

   And crowned the Christ with thorn;

   The spear was broke in twain,

   By Christ Who rose again.


   Up, mortals! life is yours,

   The prize is yours to win;

   For Christ hath vanquished by His might

   The power of death and sin;

   For sin and death were slain,

   By Christ Who rose again.


   To Thee, O Christ, be praise,

   Whose power decayeth never;

   Women came at early gloom,

   Sad at heart, and full of fears,

   Bearing to the dismal tomb,

   Spices, mingled with their tears;

   "Wherefore weep?" the angel said,

   "Christ is risen from the dead."


   Lone disciples all amazed

   Sought the place where He had lain,

   And they knew not as they gazed,

   That their Lord had risen again

   Mortals, hail the day begun,

   Christ hath risen, our glorious Sun.


   Mortals, lo! the Christ hath risen,

   "Haste, haste, with joy the tidings tell,

   The Lord hath vanquished death and hell,

   For He, the death of death,

   Hath burst asunder hades' prison,

   Let the heavens above rejoice,

   Earth unite with heaven in praising;

   All the world, and all therein,

   The promise which the Saviour made

   When His disciples sorrowed most,

   That He would send to comfort them

   The life-inspiring Holy Ghost,

   Found its fulfilment when they met

   Upon the hallowed Pentecost.


   And ever through the linkèd years,

   And they who sorrow for their sin,

   Or trial's bitter pangs endure,

   And they who mourn, and they who weep,

   Find in the Gift a peace secure.


   Vainly we mourn our absent Lord,

   If Thou, the Comforter be near;

   For it is Thine to take of His,

   And make us feel that He is here;

   We still may joy when others grieve,

   And hope when threatening clouds appear.


   Come, Holy Ghost, with us reside,

   Let Thy sweet presence fill our soul;

   And well He knows the rest,

   My sense of shame, and loss;

   Yea, I would smite my breast,

   And bow me at His Cross.


   Mayhap when I have told

   The burden of my sin,

   He'll make my spirit bold,

   And speak, and soothe, and win;--

   All this when I have told

   The burden of my sin.


   Then shall I lift mine eyes,

   And see the sin removed,

   And in the cloudless skies

   Behold the Well-Beloved;--

   Then shall I lift mine eyes,

   And see my sin removed.

   My heart was sad because of sin,

   And lo, the night came down,

   And dark without, and dark within

   I shrank before Thy frown;

   Now pity, Lord, my woeful state,

   And save me in Thy mercy great.


   I lift mine eyes to where the Christ

   My awful burden bore,

   And see the offering that sufficed,--

   His stripes and anguish sore;

   The riven side, the thorny crown,

   The wounds from which His blood flowed down.


   O Love no loving heart e'er gave!

   Like light from heaven it flows;

   And now for Him Who died to save,

   My love responsive glows;

   And joy resounds my heart within,

   That once was sad because of sin.

   O, I have wandered far,

   Good Lord Thou knowest well

   The heights of pride my feet have trod,

   The awful depths of hell;

   Now sore at heart, and sick of sin,

   O Lord in mercy take me in.


   I thought when shone the day

   The light would cloudless last,

   That stars would shine when darkness fell,

   And morn when night was past;

   But foolish hopes were quenchèd soon,

   And starless night came on at noon.


   But I have found Thy gate,

   All footsore and distressed,

   And lo, I stand and boldly knock,

   For fain I'd be at rest;

   Good Lord, in mercy take me in,

   All sore at heart and sick of sin.

   Lord, I have strayed afar

   And I can find no rest;

   Above, no guiding star,

   No hope within my breast,

   But night within and night without,

   And anxious fear and gloomy doubt.


   O, parched the desert land,

   And drear the lonely wild.

   O, that some loving hand

   Would save a wandering child,

   Who cast a Father's love aside,

   And left his home in sinful pride.


   Yea, I have heard the name

   Of One Whose heart is kind;

   Upon my night it came

   As perfume on the wind;

   It fills my soul, with trouble toss'd:

   The name of One Who seeks the lost.


   O, that His love would come

   To where I mourn distressed,

   And take a wanderer home

   To be for ever blest,

   Where I might see the Father's face,

   Nor ever wander from His grace.


   O Jesus Christ, to Thee

   My mournful prayer I send:

   Thy name can succour me,

   O Thou, the sinner's Friend;

   Incline my wayward heart, I pray,

   That I no more from home may stray.

   And, as my soul repentance brings,

   Forgive my sinful wanderings.


   O Jesus, Lord, surpassing kind,

   For this Thou cam'st, the lost to find;

   To Thee I cry, O Lord attend,

   I claim Thy help,--Thou art my Friend.


   Didst Thou not leave Thy home above?

   Didst Thou not die to tell Thy love?

   Yea, Lord, and love so great shall bless

   The sinner in his helplessness.


   I lift mine eyes--O Lord of grace,

   I hear Thy voice, I see Thy face;

   I clasp Thy wounded hand in mine,

   And trust my soul to Love divine.

   In mercy take a sinner's part;

   Lord, send Thy help to me.


   Lo, in the mire of sin I lie,

   My raiment all defiled;

   O come, and set me up on high,

   And save Thy fallen child.


   I cannot cleanse the filthy stains,--

   I can but mourn and sigh;

   For all I do, the guilt remains,

   I fail oft as I try.


   In mercy, Lord, Thy mercy send,

   For merciful art Thou;

   And prove Thyself the sinner's Friend;--

   O, come and help me now,


   And let my life be ordered quite,

   As Thou wouldst have it be;

   When I am wrong, then set me right;--

   Lord, come and succour me.


   And hold me up, lest to the mire

   Of sin My soul return;

   Let Thy pure love my spirit fire,

   And base affection burn.

   Now with my weeping would I cleanse my soul,

   And with my grief would shame my sin away;

   But tears no virtue have to make me whole,

   Nor sorrow power to end sin's hateful sway.


   But yet the heart in sore distress that sighs,

   Looks to the Christ His succour to impart;

   And God receives the pleasing sacrifice,

   A broken spirit, and a contrite heart.


   Nailed to the Cross I see my Saviour bleed;

   This is the sacrifice my soul requires,

   Here is the cleansing, and the strength I need,

   To quell the rising of my vain desires.


   Speak to my heart, O Jesus Christ Who came

   Fired by Thy love, an offering for sin;

   And by a love enkindled at that flame,

   Win me for ever from the self within.

   The longings of my soul that burn;

   Wilt Thou not seek Thy erring child,

   Who fain from waywardness would turn?


   Thou knowest the paths my feet have trod,

   And Thou alone canst bring me back;

   My hungering soul cries out to God,

   Within Whose home there is no lack.


   O Jesus, Shepherd of my soul,

   Didst Thou not come to seek and find?

   To lead the lost by wise control,

   And tend with love surpassing kind?


   I will arise and seek Thy face;

   Yea, Lord, arise and seek Thou me,

   And bring me in Thy plenteous grace,

   Where I shall safely dwell with Thee.

   I fear the things of earth to lose,

   O Gracious Christ, to me reveal

   The riches that are sure;

   And I shall shun the base, unreal,

   And grasp what shall endure.

   My sin was very great,

   Its burden bore me down;

   I dared not lift my eyes to God,

   So much I feared His frown;

   And sore my conscience smote,

   And all was sad within,

   For I had turned away from God

   Who loved me in my sin.


   I said "I'll tell it all,

   The sin, the grief, the pain,

   Mayhap He'll pardon my offence,

   And take me back again."

   And then my heart was glad,

   To think it might be done,

   If I but cast myself upon

   The merits of His Son.


   I said "Ah, God, receive

   The sacrifice I bring,--

   A broken and a contrite heart,

   That is my offering;

   And for His sake Who came

   To bear the Cross of pain,

   Forgive the error of my life,

   And take me back again."


   'Twas then the heart of love

   That I had wounded sore,

   In loving accents spake to me,

   And bade me sin no more;

   And spake the word of grace

   That made my spirit whole;

   And now the pain and grief are gone,

   For gladness fills my soul.

   In penitence sincere;

   And may the memories of the past

   Teach me to walk in fear.


   For I have strayed, and Thou hast sought,

   And I have strayed again;

   O, may the wanderer Thou hast brought,

   Within the fold remain.


   O, touch my heart, till love arise,

   And claim me for Thine own;

   And bring Thy great Salvation near;

   Have mercy, Lord.


   May peace within our world reside;

   Thy Church her cause to Thee confide,

   And all, as one, in Thee abide;


   Here let Thy people Thee revere;

   In faith, and piety draw near,

   And worship Thee in holy fear;


   Thy priests within this holy place

   Dispense the bounties of Thy grace,

   As those who serve before Thy face.


   Our Sovereign Lord with wisdom dress,

   With hands unstained his council bless;

   Upbuild his throne in righteousness.


   In time of war, with strength endue,

   Our hearts possess with courage true;

   Our foes against the right subdue.


   May earth her flowers and blossoms yield;

   May fruits encrown the harvest field;

   From waste, and want, Thy people shield.


   The sailor on the restless deep,

   The homeless in their wandering, keep;

   The suffering soothe with kindly sleep.


   Keep Thou our souls, O God, from harm,

   From wrath, and danger, and alarm,

   Safe in Thy strong, encircling arm.

   Have mercy, Lord.

   Lord, let our evening prayer ascend,

   Thy servants by Thy grace defend,

   Save, guard, and keep us to the end;

   Have mercy, Lord.


   When in the night our eyelids close,

   Lord, may our souls in Thee repose,

   Safe from the danger of their foes;

   Grant this, O Lord.


   Thy angel, peace, with us abide,

   Nor ever leave Thy servants' side,

   Our souls to guard, our steps to guide.

   Grant this, O Lord.


   Lord, let the sins--our souls' distress,

   Which we in penitence confess--

   Be pardoned in Thy faithfulness.


   Our souls in Thee, O Lord, are blest;

   Send what Thou knowest to be best;

   We would not crave Thee for the rest.


   Our time remaining, Lord, control;

   Our sin, like clouds, far from us roll,

   And give Thy peace within our soul.


   And when we leave the world behind,

   May we, unshamed and fearless, find

   The Christ, our Judge, surpassing kind.

   Grant this, O Lord.

   When glory crowned the mountain top,

   And Christ was decked in garments fair,

   The prophets of the Lord appeared,

   And talked with the Redeemer there.


   "Let us make this our dwelling place,"

   'Twas thus His followers made request;

   "For it is good to linger here,

   And they who dwell with Thee are blest."


   Then from a cloud a voice was heard,

   While each in terror held his breath,--

   "This is My well-beloved Son,

   Hear ye what the Beloved saith."


   O Jesus, when Thy glory gilds

   The mount of God on which we meet,

   May we the voice from heaven discern,

   And bow expectant at Thy feet.

   Make bold to enter in?

   I cannot all the past forget

   My lovelorn soul would break the ties

   That bind to earth, and earthly things,

   Would mount to Thee on soaring wings.


   O Love divine, wilt Thou come down,

   And make Thy dwelling place with me?

   My empty heart would be Thy home,

   And all my life would cling to Thee.


   Thou knowest the path that leads to earth,

   For Thou didst sojourn once with men;

   Thou didst not scorn the lowly birth,

   Nor yet our humble dwelling then.


   'Twas love that brought Thee then, and now

   Thy love retains its fervent glow;

   O Lord, Thy heavens in mercy bow,

   And seek my longing soul below.

  THE NEW YEAR

   All-embracing as the Greek service books are, curiously enough they
   contain, strictly speaking, no Thanksgiving services. It has been left
   for the Russian Church to make them for the Greeks to imitate.

   The models of the Ektene and Litanies are found in the Euchologion, at
   vespers, but adaptations of their petitions to every eventuality in
   human life, are the work of Russians, whose names, however, have not
   been preserved. Here is an example from the Thanksgiving service for
   the New Year.

   On earth with mortals long ago,

   The heavy-laden knew Thee well,

   And Thou didst heed their cry of woe.


   And Thou didst hear the humble prayer

   That told the sorrow of the soul;

   And to the spirit crushed by care

   Thou gav'st the word that made it whole.


   The darkened mind with heavenly light

   Thou, from Thy presence, didst illume;

   And day returning after night,

   Dispelled their dismal clouds of gloom.


   And eyes with sorrow filled were made

   To shine with hope like early morn;

   Enduring joys for those that fade,

   Thou gav'st their sadness to adorn.


   And Thou, O Christ, art still the same,

   Time hath not chilled Thy loving heart;

   Come then, as Christ in mercy came,

   And now, as then, Thyself impart.

   The King shall come when morning dawns,

   And earth's dark night is past;--

   O, haste the rising of that morn,

   That day that aye shall last.


   And let the endless bliss begin,

   By weary saints foretold,

   When right shall triumph over wrong,

   And truth shall be extolled.


   The King shall come when morning dawns,

   And light and beauty brings;--

   Hail! Christ the Lord; Thy people pray,

   "Come quickly, King of kings."

   A halo rests upon Thy brow,

   O Saviour of the sons of men;

   For Thou art crowned a Victor now;--

   But Thou wilt come to us again.


   Thou hast a thought for those who tread

   The steeps of life, and often fail[

   The weak in faith lift up the head,

   And in Thy strength, O Christ, prevail.


   Thou art not far removed from those,

   That yearn for Thee, and seek Thy grace;

   Who in Thy tender love repose,

   May hear Thy voice, and see Thy face;--


   And know the love that giveth rest,

   And share its strength, and feel its glow;

   As he who leaned upon Thy breast,

   When Thou wert with us, long ago.


   But hearts are sad, and lives are lone,

   They long for Thee, who love Thee most;

   Even when Thy promised Gift they own,--

   The comfort of the Holy Ghost.


   Thou art our Faith, our Hope, our Love,

   O Lover of the souls of men;

   Bow down Thy heavens, and from above,

   Come, Blessed Lord, to us again.

   'Anothen, parthenoi, boes egersinekros echos

   St. Methodius, 3rd Century


   Behold the Bridegroom! Hark the cry,

   The dead awaking, rends the sky!

   Go, virgins, He is near,

   Your lamps all burning clear;

   He enters where the rising light

   Asunder bursts the gates of night.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   The smiles of earth that turn to tears,

   Its empty joys and foolish fears

   I leave, for Thou dost call,--

   Thou art my Life, my All;

   I would Thy beauty ever see,

   Then let me, Blessed, cling to Thee.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   For Thee I leave the world behind,--

   Thou art my Bliss, O Bridegroom kind;

   My beauty's not mine own--

   'Tis Thine, O Christ, alone;

   The bridal chamber I would see,

   In perfect happiness to be.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.


   O God, exalted on Thy throne,

   Who dwell'st in purity unknown,

   Lo, now we humbly wait,

   Throw wide the heavenly gate,

   And with the Bridegroom, of Thy grace,

   Give us at Thy right hand a place.

   In holy garb, with lamp aglow,

   To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

   Awake, my soul, bestir thee, for the hour is drawing nigh,

   When the trump of God shall blazon from the silence of the sky,

   And He shall come a second time, Who came at first to die.


   It may be in the morning, when the hills are bathed in light,

   Or at the hour of noontide, when the sun is at his height;

   But it may be in the darkness, in the middle of the night.


   Be sure the hour is coming, and repenting seek His face,

   For He Who comes to judge the world, is still the Lord of grace,

   His throne shall be a Mercy seat, His love a hiding place.


   O Christ, in mercy save us, ere that day of dread appear,

   When sinners from Thy judgement seat their awful doom shall bear;

   Awake, my soul, bestir thee, for the time is drawing near.

   6,6,6,6,6,6
   Ode from the Penitential Office at Matins


   The time is drawing nigh,

   Even now the day is near,

   When Christ from heaven high

   To judgement shall appear;

   Keep watch, my soul, in fear,

   The Judge of men is near.


   Then kings and princes great,

   The rich and poor shall meet;

   And high and low estate

   Shall gather round His feet;

   Keep watch, my soul, in fear,

   The Judge of men is near.


   No crafty words shall mar,

   Nor sophistry distract;

   No parrying counsel jar

   With the eternal fact;

   Keep watch, my soul, in fear,

   The Judge of men is near.


   O Christ, in mercy then,

   Forbid my soul should go

   With lost and ruined men,

   Down to the place of woe;

   Keep watch, my soul, in fear,

   The Judge of men is near.
