A New Year's Benediction

   (No. 3387)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 1, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 3, 1868.

   "Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
   such things as you have, for He has said, I willnever leave you, nor
   forsake you." Hebrews 13:5.

   OBSERVE the way in which the Apostles were accustomed to incite
   Believers in Christ to the performance of their duties. They did not
   tell them, "You must do this or that, or you will be punished. You must
   do this and then you shall obtain a reward for it." They never cracked
   the whip of the Law in the ears of the child of God. They knew the
   difference between the man who was actuated by sordid motives and the
   fear of punishment--and the newborn man who is moved by more sublime
   motives, namely, motives that touch his heart, that move his
   regenerated nature and that compel him, out of affection, to do the
   will of Him that sent him. Hence the address, here, is not, "Be
   content, or else God will take away what you have," but, "Be content
   and have nothing to do with covetousness, for He has said, "I will
   never leave you, nor forsake you."

   The promise is made the argument for the precept! Obedience is enforced
   by a Covenant blessing. He has said, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." What then? Shall I be discontented and covetous? No! But
   for the very reason that He has made, by His promise, my very safety
   absolute and unconditional, assuring me, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you"--for that reason I will keep covetousness and every other
   evil thing out of my conversation and will seek to walk contentedly and
   happy in the Presence of my God! See, Brothers and Sisters, this Gospel
   motive. It is a Free Grace argument. It is not a weapon taken from the
   arsenal of Mount Sinai, but taken from the region of the Cross and from
   the council chamber of the Covenant of Love!

   Another thing in the text to which I would call your notice is
   this--that an Inspired Apostle who might very well have used his own
   original words, nevertheless, in this case, as indeed in many others,
   quotes the Old Testament. "He has said, I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." Behold, then, the value of Holy Scripture! If an Inspired
   man quotes the text as of Divine authority, much more should we so
   regard it, who are without such inspiration. We should be much in
   searching the Scriptures and when we want to clench an argument, or
   answer an opponent, it would always be well for us to take our weapon
   from the grand old Book and come down with, "He has said." Oh, there is
   nothing like this for force and power! We may think a thing, but what
   of that? Our opinions are but of little worth. General authority and
   universal opinion may sustain it, but what of that? The world has been
   more frequently wrong than right and public opinion is a fickle thing.
   But '"He has said," that is to say, God has said--Immutable Truth and
   eternal fidelity have said God, who made Heaven and earth, and who
   changes not, though nations melt like the hoar frost of the
   morning--God who always lives when hills, mountains and this round
   world and everything upon it shall have passed away--"He has said!" Oh,
   the power there is in this, "He has said, I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you"! So, then, let us be much in searching the Scriptures,
   much in feeding upon them, much in diving into their innermost
   depths--and then afterwards much in the habit of quoting them, using
   them as arguments for the defense of the Truths of God, as weapons
   against error and as reasons to call us to the path of duty and to
   pursue it!

   But now to come to the promise, itself, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." I shall call your attention, first of all, to--

   I. THE REMARKABLE CHARACTER OF THIS PROMISE.

   Is it not an amazing fact that while others leave us and forsake us,
   that God never does? It is to each one of His own redeemed people that
   He says, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." How often do men
   play false and forsake those whom they call their friends when those
   friends fall into poverty Ah, the tragedies of some of these cruel
   forsakings! May you never know them! These so-called friends knew their
   friends when that suit of black was new, but how sadly their eyesight
   fails them, now it is turned to a rusty brown! They knew them extremely
   well when once a week they sat with their legs under their table and
   shared their generous hospitality--but they know them not, now that
   they knock at their door and crave help in a time of need!

   Matters have changed altogether and friends that once were cherished
   are now forgotten. In fact, the man almost pities himself to think that
   he should have been so unfortunate to have a friend who has come down
   so and he has no pity for his friend because he is so much occupied in
   pitying himself! In hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of cases,
   as soon as the gold has gone, the pretended love has gone! And when the
   dwelling has been changed from the mansion to the cottage, the
   friendship, which once promised to last forever, has suddenly
   disappeared!

   But, Brothers and Sisters, God will never leave us on account of
   poverty! However low we may be brought, there it always stands--"I will
   never leave you, nor forsake you." Scant may be your board. You may
   have hard work to provide things honest in the sight of all men. You
   may sometimes have to look and look again--and wonder by what straits
   you will be enabled to escape out of your present difficulty. But when
   all friends have turned their backs and when acquaintances have fallen
   from you like leaves in autumn, He has said, "I will never leave you,
   nor forsake you." Then beneath His bounty you shall find a shelter! And
   when these other hands are shut, His hands shall still be outstretched
   in loving kindness and tender mercy to help and deliver the soul of the
   needy!

   Sometimes, and very often, too, men lose all their friends if they fall
   into any temporary disgrace. They may really have done no wrong--they
   may even have done right-- but public opinion may condemn the course
   they took, or slander may be propagated which casts them into the
   shade! And then men suddenly grow forgetful. They do not know the
   man--how should they? He is not the same man--to them at any rate--and
   as the world gives him the cold shoulder, his friends serve him the
   same. The old proverb, "The devil take the hindmost," seems to be
   generally the custom with our friends when we get into seeming
   disgrace! They are all off, seeing who can run away first, for they
   fear that they shall be left to share in our dishonor. But it is never
   so with our God. "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." You may be
   put into the dungeon, like Paul and Silas, but God will make you sing
   there, even at midnight! You may be set in the stocks, but even there
   God will cause you to greatly rejoice! You may be cast into the fiery
   furnace, but He will tread the flames with you! You may be so
   dishonored that men shall treat you as they did God's only Son--and
   lift you up upon the cross of shame and put you to death--but you shall
   never ask, "Why have You forsaken me?" Your Lord said it when He bore
   your guilt, but you shall never need to say it, for your guilt is put
   away forever and Jehovah will stand by you in all your dishonor! And
   let me say here that there is never a child in the family that is
   dearer to the great Father than the child that is suffering shame and
   contempt from others! He loves them dearest when they suffer reproach
   for His sake! These are nearer to His heart than any other and He bids
   them rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great shall be their reward
   in Heaven if thus they bear and endure for His name! "I will never
   leave you, My persecuted one! I will pour such joy into your heart that
   you shall forget all the dishonor. I will send an angel to minister to
   you. Yes, I will, Myself, be with you and you shall rejoice in My
   salvation while your heart is glad and calm in the midst of the tumult
   and the strife around."

   Blessed be God, all the shame and spitting that men can put upon us can
   never put our God away, for, "He has said, I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." Alas, sad is it for human nature that we must say it--how
   many have been forsaken when they have been no longer able to minister
   to the pleasure and comfort of those who admired them while they
   profited by them! Some are thus thrown aside just as men throw away
   household stuff that is worn out and is of no further use. Depend upon
   it, men will not forsake us while they can get anything out of us! But
   when there is no longer anything to profit by, when the poor woman
   becomes so decrepit that she can scarcely move from her bed to her
   chair, when the man becomes so laid aside by accident or is so weak
   that he cannot take his place in the great march of life--then he is
   like the soldiers in Napoleon's march--he drops out of the line to die
   and thousands either march over him, or if they are a little more
   merciful, march by and around him! But few are those who will stop to
   care for such and attend to them. How often are the incurable forsaken
   and left! But He has said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."
   If we should getso old that we cannot serve the Church of God, even by
   a single word. If we should become so sick that we are only a burden to
   those of our house who have to nurse us. If we should grow so feeble
   that we could not lift our hand to our lip, yet the eternal love of
   Jehovah would not have diminished, no, not so much as by a single jot
   towards the souls whom He had loved from before the foundation of the
   world! However low your condition, you shall find God's love is always
   underneath for your uplifting! However weak you are, His strength shall
   be revealed in the everlasting arms that will not permit you to sink
   into disaster and your soul into Hell. This, then, is a very precious
   text! Others may forsake us for different reasons--too many to be
   mentioned now--but He has said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you." Well, then, let the rest go! If the Lord Jehovah stands at our
   right hand, we can well afford to see the backs of all our friends, for
   we shall find Friends enough in the Triune God whom we delight to
   serve!

   Again, this is a very remarkable promise if we think of our own conduct
   towards God. "He has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you."
   And have not we often said the same to Him? We were like Peter--we felt
   we did love our Savior--we were sure we did and we did not, could not
   believe that we could ever be so false or so faithless as to forsake
   Him. We almost longed for some temptation to prove how true we would
   be! We felt very vexed with other professors, that they should prove so
   untrue! We felt in our heart that we could not do like that and that we
   would stand firm under any imaginable pressure! But what became of us,
   my Brothers and Sisters? Charge your memories a moment. Did the rooster
   that accused Peter never accuse you? Did you never deny your Lord and
   Master and, at last, hearing the warning voice, go out and weep
   bitterly because you had forgotten Him--He whom you had declared so
   solemnly you would never forsake? Oh, yes, I fear we, many and many a
   time, have said, "I will never leave You, nor forsake You," and yet
   under some sarcasm, some ridicule, or some pressing trial, we have been
   like the children of Ephraim and, though armed and carrying bows, we
   have turned our back in the day of battle! If your voice has never
   denied Christ, has your heart ever done so? If your tongue has remained
   silent, has not your soul sometimes gone back to the old flesh-pots of
   Egypt and said, "I would gladly find comfort once again where I did
   find it with my old companions and in the old ways"? Ah, well, as you
   think of this--how unkindly and ungenerously you have treated your
   Lord--let this text stand out in bold relief, "He has said, I will
   never leave you, nor forsake you." Although you have often forgotten
   Him, yet, His loving kindness changes not! Though you have been fickle,
   He has been firm! Though you have sometimes believed Him not, yet He
   has remained faithful--glory be to His name!

   Again, this promise is a very remarkable one if we notice how it
   overrides all the suggestions that might arise from a mere view of
   strict and severe justice. It might be said, "Surely a child of God
   might justly be forsaken. He might so sin against God that it would
   only be just to leave him utterly to himself." Now, I am free to grant
   that a child of God might do so, no, that allthe children of God do do
   so and that God would be just if He acted upon the stern principle of
   His Law to forsake His children as soon as ever they were converted,
   for it is not long after their conversion that they sin! And that sin
   is a special kind of treason against God. He would be just even if He
   cast them away! But what I desire to enforce is this--that the promise
   is remarkable because it makes no kind of provision for this in any
   sort of degree and under no imaginable circumstances! It does not say,
   "I will never leave you, nor forsake you if--as certain brethren are
   prone to put it--"if--you do not forsake Me." Nor does it say, "I will
   never leave you, nor forsake you if you do such-and-such and
   such-and-such." It is an absolute promise without any perhapses, ifs,
   buts, conditions, or promises! "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you."

   He that believes in Jesus shall never be so left of God as to fall
   finally from Grace! He shall never be so deserted as to give up his
   God, for his God will never give him up so far as to let him give up
   his confidence, or his hope, or his love, or his trust! The Lord, even
   our God, holds us with His strong right hand and we shall not be moved!
   And even if we sin-- sweet thought!--"If any man sins, we have an
   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous." Over the heads
   of all our sins and iniquities, this promise sounds like a sweet silver
   bell, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."

   Now, there are some that would make licentiousness out of this and go
   into sin, but in doing so they prove themselves not to be the children
   of God! They show at once that they know nothing of the matter, for the
   genuine child of God, when he has a promise which is unconditional,
   finds holiness in it. Being moved by gratitude, he needs no buts, ifs,
   conditions, racks and scourges in order to do right. He is ruled by
   love, not by fear! He is governed by a holy gratitude which becomes a
   stronger bond to sacred obedience than any other bond that could be
   invented! Hence to the child of

   God, the knowledge that God will not leave nor forsake him, never
   suggests the thought of plunging into sin! He were an awful monster,
   indeed, if he did any such thing, but he hates it and he says--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again

   With love intense I burn--

   Chosen of Him ere time began

   I choose Him in return."

   Observe, then, how remarkable is the promise--so contrary to the manner
   of men, so contrary to our own conduct and so absolute and
   unconditional, that it is, indeed, marvelous that such a word should be
   on record. "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."

   I cannot leave this part of the subject without remarking that such a
   promise as this seems to me that it makes a clean sweep of every
   suggestion to the child of God to be depressed in mind. You tell me you
   do not feel, just now, as you did some time ago--you are not anything
   like so earnest and lively in the Divine ways.

   When a Believer is in this state, it is sometimes suggested to him that
   doubtless he is not a Christian at all--and that he must go back
   altogether to Egypt in order to get Gospel liberty. This is
   foolishness! But this promise comes in and says to him, "God has not
   left you, nor forsaken you." Whatever may be your present state of
   thought and feeling, however low you may have fallen, the Eternal God
   is still faithful! He has not forgotten you! Go to Him now--ask for
   reviving and refreshing, for He will surely give them to you.
   Conscience will, perhaps, say to some child of God tonight-- indeed, I
   hope it will--"There has been much today in business that has not been
   what it should have been, and as you look back upon the day, you will
   see much to mourn over." And then, perhaps, conscience will add,
   "Therefore God will leave you." Now, if you come to believe that, you
   will live worse tomorrow than today! And the next day still worse! But
   if you can answer, "No, He has said, 'I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you,'" and can go with child-like confidence to your God and
   confess the sins of the day and begin again washing once more in the
   precious Fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins,
   tomorrow there will be a better day! The joy of the Lord will be your
   strength against the sin and your confidence in your Father's Immutable
   Affection will inspire you with zeal to trample down your temptations!
   Perhaps the devil may be injecting into your soul tonight all sorts of
   strange things--that God has quite forsaken you and that He will be
   gracious no more to you and other lies of that kind. But He has said,
   "I will never leave you, nor forsake you," and if you can get hold of
   this, it will be a sufficient refutation of all the suggestions of your
   own fear and of the infernal power! No, Satan! I will cast myself upon
   the precious blood of Jesus! And if God should take all my property
   away, yet He has not left me, nor forsaken me! I am sure of that! And
   if my spirit sinks so low that I dare not look up, yet still He has
   said He has not left me, and He never will! If my sins should roll over
   me like a big billow and my conscience should cry out against me--and I
   should feel no rest and no peace--yet still I will hold on to Jesus,
   sink or swim, for He has said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you." And let God be true and every man and every devil-- and even my
   own conscience--prove a liar sooner than God's Word should for a moment
   be placed in doubt!

   We now pass on to ponder upon--

   II. THE REMARKABLE COMFORT CONTAINED IN THIS PROMISE.

   See how it abounds! I note, first, its constancy. "I will never leave
   you, nor forsake you." That is, not for a day, not for an hour, not for
   a minute! There are no breaks in the Divine Love. God does not depart
   from His people to return to them, by-and-by, but He assures, "I will
   never, no never, leave you." Perhaps that dear child of yours that is
   sick is soon to die. Well, God will not leave you in the moment when
   she is taken from you. Possibly that dear one who is now your comfort
   and delight, your husband, may get sick and it will be a terrible
   stroke for you to be visited with, but, "I will never leave you, not
   even for an instant! Then in that trying time you shall prove the power
   and solace of My Presence."

   Perhaps, businessman, that great commercial project, that great
   transaction of yours may prove to be a losing one-- that bill may be
   dishonored, you may come to bankruptcy without any fault on your part
   but--"I will never leave you nor forsake you." Yes, you may have to go
   to Australia and you may greatly dread the leaving your native land,
   but even then, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." It may be you
   may be so misrepresented as to become suspected by those whom you love
   best and you may be even put out of the Church of God without any fault
   but entirely through error. Well, but then, even then, "I will never
   leave you, nor forsake you " not even for a minute! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, what would be the consequences if the Lord left us for one
   quarter of an hour? I solemnly believe that if God were to leave

   His people even on their knees for twenty minutes, they would be
   brought to the deepest Hell! But He will not leave them, even there!
   And if it were dangerous to leave them on their knees alone, how much
   more so in the market or in business amidst enemies--seeking to catch
   them in their speech and deed! But He will never for a moment leave His
   people nor forsake them! He will be at all times, at all hours, at all
   seasons, in all days of emergency at their right hand and they shall
   not be moved!

   I notice in the promise, next to constancy, endurance. As there shall
   be no breaks in God's love for His own, so there shall be no end to it.
   "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." Yes it may not be desirable
   to live to extreme old age when infirmities may abound and all strength
   may decay, but if you should reach it, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." It certainly is a painful thing--that last stroke to pass
   to the Throne of God--but, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."
   There shall never be a time when the Lord will cast away one of His
   people! He shall never grow weary of them. He has espoused them unto
   Himself--married them--taken them into eternal union with Himself! And
   let the ages revolve as they may and time change as it will, God will
   never leave or forsake His people! Comfort yourselves, therefore, with
   the confidence of the endurance as well as the constancy of this love!

   We are most pleased, however, with the fullness of the promise. The
   text means, manifestly means, from its connection, a great deal more
   than it says. We are told not to be covetous. Why? Why should we be
   covetous? God has said He will never leave us and if we have Him, we
   possess all things1 Who has need to be covetous when all things are his
   and God is his? We are told to be contented--not to seek to hoard up so
   much for the future--because God has provided for the future in the
   very promise, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." God guarantees
   to His servants that they shall have enough! Well, let that guarantee
   prevent both covetousness and discontent! How shall this promise apply
   to temporal things? "I will never leave you, nor forsake you " does not
   look, at first sight, as if it had anything to do with our ordinary
   expenses. But according to the text it has, for we are told not to be
   covetous, but to be content with such things as we have. So then, the
   text applies to the ordinary workingman, to the merchant, to every
   Christian even in his money matters as well as in his soul matters! "I
   will not leave you, even in these." He that does not let a sparrow fall
   to the ground without His permission, will not let His children want!
   If they should, for a little time, be in need, that shall work their
   lasting good--they shall dwell in the land and verily they shall be
   fed! The fullness that lies in the promise is perfectly unbounded. When
   God says He will be with His servants, He means this, "My wisdom shall
   be with them to guide them. My love shall be with them to cheer them.
   My Spirit shall be with them to sanctify them. My power shall be with
   them to defend them. My everlasting might shall be put forth on their
   behalf so that they may not fail nor be discouraged." To have God with
   you were better than to have an army of ten thousand men! And a host of
   friends were not equal to that one name--the name of Jehovah--for He is
   a host in Himself! When God is with a man, He is not there asleep,
   negligent, indifferent--regardless in his time of suffering--but He is
   there intensely sympathizing, bearing the trouble, helping and
   sustaining the sufferer and, in due time--His own good time--delivering
   him in triumph! Oh, precious word of heartening promise! Plunge into
   it, for it is a sea without a bottom! "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you."

   Better still, perhaps, in the promise is the certain truth of it. "I
   will never leave you, nor forsake you " has been proven by God's saints
   in all the ages that are past. Turn to the pages of your Bibles and see
   if ever a man was ashamed that put his trust in Christ! See if he that
   wrestled with the invisible God was ever confounded. Has not the Lord
   stayed with His people at all hazards--broken the necks of kings and
   scattered empires like chaff before the wind sooner than that one of
   His faithful ones should come to ruin?

   It has been so even in your own experience. You, too, have found the
   text to be true. You have gone through fire and through water, but He
   has never left you nor forsaken you! Your vessel scarcely had enough
   water to stay off the bottom, but though she had almost grated on the
   gravel, yet she has kept afloat and though, perhaps, you have been
   wrecked, yet you have come safely to shore. You have lost much, you
   say, but you have been a gainer by your loss and where you are today
   you are by eternal mercy and Covenant Grace--and you could not well be
   in a better position than God has put you Goodness and mercy have
   followed you all the days of your life up till now and you are obliged
   to confess it and to say--

   "Streams of mercy never ceasing Call for songs of loudest praise."

   So fear not, now that at this particular season God is about to alter
   His previous dispensation! Out with them, poor Little-Faith! Away with
   your doubts! Put away those black suspicions! He is a God that changes
   not and, having helped you until now, He will help you even to the end!
   Why how true this must be! "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."
   How can God forsake that which has cost Him so much already? He has
   given His Son's blood to redeem us and His Spirit's power to renew
   us--and if He were to leave undone the work which He has begun--why a
   tower has been commenced and He has not been able to finish it! A man
   who has spent much money upon one enterprise will spend yet more to
   finish it because of what he has already spent. Now God will not lose
   the work of Christ and the precious blood of His Son--having begun, He
   will certainly carry on even to the end! Besides this--God cannot leave
   His people because He calls them His children--and how could He leave
   His child? "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not
   have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, she may forget, yet will I
   not forget you." Even when the son has dishonored his father's name and
   lost his own character, that father's love still holds on and still
   follows that child with tears of sorrow, but still with faithfulness
   and truth. And God will not cast away His own begotten sons whom He has
   begotten again unto a living hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead! Beloved, Christ is married to His people and, therefore,
   how can He leave them? He says, "As a young man rejoices over his
   bride, so shall your God rejoice over you." And will He leave them to
   whom He is knit by so near and dear, so tender and affectionate a
   union? It cannot be! "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." Now, if
   He did leave His people, what would it be? It would be giving up the
   whole quarrel between Himself and Satan! It is in His people's hearts
   that the great battle is being fought out between good and evil. To
   give them up would be to give up the battleground to His great
   enemy--and what laughter there would be in the vaults of Hell! What
   mockery in the halls of Pandemonium if it could be said, "God has
   forsaken His people! Given up His elect! Suffered His redeemed to
   perish! Cast away His regenerate and forsaken the souls that trusted
   Him!" The very thought of it is blasphemy! Far, far from us, let us put
   it away. "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."

   I cannot enlarge further upon the promise and need not do so because it
   opens up itself, or rather God the Holy Spirit will open it up to you
   if you sit awhile in your chamber and meditate upon it. I do not know
   of a richer text or one more full of consolation. It is a long skein of
   the Truth of God--unwind it. It is a precious granary as full as Joseph
   crammed the granaries of Egypt! Open the door and feed to the
   fullest--there will be no fear of your ever exhausting it! "For He has
   said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you."

   Now the third thing to be noticed concerning this promise is--

   III. THE REMARKABLE EFFECTS THAT SUCH A PROMISE SHOULD PRODUCE.

   Surely the first blessed fruit of such a glorious promise should be
   perfect contentment. It is said to be hard to be content. I have the
   pleasure of knowing some Brothers and Sisters who I am sure are
   perfectly content. They even say so and I think without the slightest
   mental reservation that they have not an unfulfilled wish or desire so
   far as this world goes. They have all that heart could wish. And yet
   these are not the richest people in the world and they are not persons
   who are much to be envied for their mere external circumstances--yet
   they are perfectly content. The fact is that the Grace of God makes the
   people of God to sing sweetly where other people would murmur! They are
   satisfied where others would find easy ground for discontent. But how
   easy it is--how easy it must be for a man to be content when he knows
   that God has promised to be with him in all circumstances and at all
   times! Surely if anything could be a kind of conservatory--a hot-house
   in which to grow the delicate plant of contentment to perfection--it
   must be this full belief that high or low, rich or poor, well or sick,
   God has said, "I will never leave, nor forsake you." Surely it was this
   that made Bunyan's Pilgrim sing in the Valley of Humiliation--

   "He that is down need fear no fall.

   He that is low no pride--

   He that is humble ever shall

   Have God to be his guide."

   Christian did thereby say that he was content whether he had little or
   much, and that he left everything in his lot to his God. Oh, get then,
   my Friends, my text fully into your souls and keep it there as marrow
   and fatness--and you will be content!

   Well, then, in the next place, it will cure your covetousness. A man
   does not need to go on scraping and to use that muck-rake forever when
   he knows, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." It was not a bad
   argument which one usedwith Alexander when he said to him, "When are
   you going to enjoy yourself fully?" Alexander did not answer the
   question but the philosopher said, "What are you going to do next?"
   "First we shall conquer Greece." "Yes, and then will you rest?" "No, we
   shall then attack Asia Minor." "And when you have conquered that, I
   suppose you will rest?" "No, we shall then take Persia." "And when you
   have overcome Persia, what then?" "We shall march to India." "And when
   you have taken India, what then?" "Why, then we shall sit down and make
   ourselves merry." "Well " said the philosopher, "I think we had better
   begin before we go to Greece, or Persia, or Asia Minor, or any of
   them." And truly so it were as well for us to be content with that
   moderate income which God gives us. Let us enjoy what God bestows upon
   us now in gratitude to Him and give ourselves up to His service lest,
   perhaps, in seeking more, we become spiritually poorer while literally
   richer--and become less content with the great load on our back than we
   have today, when we have enough and no more. It is a sweet quietus to
   covetousness when God says, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you."

   And, Beloved, what a promise this is to make a man confident in his
   God. In his works, in his sufferings, in his enterprises--what a stay
   of soul is here!

   I know what it is to fall back upon this promise, sometimes, to keep
   from depression of spirit and to find reviving in it. Perhaps you may
   suppose that those of us who are always before the public and are
   speaking concerning the blessed promises of God, never have any moments
   of downcasting and never any times of heart-breaking, but you are quite
   mistaken! We may have passed through all this, perhaps, that we may
   know how to say a word in season to any who are now passing through
   similar experiences. With many enterprises upon my hands, far too great
   for my own unaided strength, I am often driven to fall flat upon the
   promise of my God, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." If I feel
   that any scheme has been of my own devising and that I seek my own
   honor in it, I know it must come to the ground and rightly so! But when
   I can prove that God has thrust it upon me and that I am moved by a
   Divine impulse and not by my own monitions and wishes, then how can my
   God forsake me? How can He lie, however weak I may be? How is it
   possible for Him to send His servant out to battle and not succor him
   with reinforcements in the day when the battle goes bad? God is not
   David when he put Uriah in the front and then left him that he might
   die. He will never put any of His servants forward and then desert
   them! Dear Brothers and Sisters, if the Lord shall call some of you
   even to things you cannot do, He will give you strength enough to do
   them! And if He should push you still forward till your difficulties
   increase and your burdens become heavy as your days, your strength
   shall be and you shall go on with the tramp of soldiers with the
   indomitable spirit of men who have tried and trusted the naked arm of
   the Eternal God! "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." Then what
   does it matter? Though all the world were against you, you could shake
   all the world as Samson shook the lion and tore him as a kid! If God is
   for you, who can be against you? Though earth and Hell and all their
   crew come against you and should combine together, yet if the God of
   Jacob stood at your back, you would thresh them as though they were but
   wheat and winnow them as though they were but chaff--and the wind would
   carry them away! Oh, roll this promise under your tongue as a sweet
   morsel!

   How I wish that it belonged to you all! Oh, that everyone of you had a
   share in it! But some of you, alas, have never fled to Jesus. Oh that
   you would do so! Whoever trusts Him for pardon by His atoning Sacrifice
   is saved! To look to the Great Substitute and depend upon Him for
   salvation--this gives salvation--and then come the promises that belong
   to the saved!

   The Lord in His infinite mercy bless you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Soul-threshing

   (No. 3388)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For the black cummin are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
   neither is a cartwheel turned about upon the cummin, but the black
   cummin are beaten out with a stick and the cummin with a rod. Bread
   flour must be ground; therefore he does not thresh it forever, nor
   break it with his cartwheel, nor bruise it with his horsemen." Isaiah
   28:27,28.

   The art of farming was taught to man by God. He would have starved
   while he was discovering it, so the Lord, when He sent him out of the
   Garden of Eden, gave him a measure of elementary instruction in
   agriculture, even as the Prophet puts it, "His God did instruct him to
   discretion and did teach him." God has taught man to plow, to break the
   clods, to sow the different kinds of grain and to thresh out the
   different orders of seeds.

   The Eastern farmer could not thresh by machinery as we do, but still,
   he was ingenious and discreet in that operation. Sometimes a heavy
   instrument was dragged over the corn to tear out the grain. This is
   what is intended in the first clause by the "threshing instrument," as
   also in that passage, "I have made you a sharp threshing instrument
   having teeth." When the corn-drag was not used, they often turned the
   heavy solid wheel of a country cart over the straw. This is alluded to
   in the next sentence--"Neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the
   cummin." They also had flails not very unlike our own, and then for
   still smaller seeds, such as dill and cummin, they used a simple staff
   or a slender switch. "The black cummin are beaten out with a stick and
   the cummin with a rod."

   This is not the time or place to give a dissertation upon threshing. We
   find every information upon that subject in proper books, but the
   meaning of the illustration is this--that as God has taught farmers to
   distinguish between different kinds of grain in the threshing, so does
   He, in His Infinite Wisdom, deal discreetly with different sorts of
   men. He does not try us all alike, seeing we are differently
   constituted. He does not pass us all through the same agony of
   convic-tion--we are not all, to the same extent, threshed with terrors.
   He does not give us all to endure the same family or bodily affliction.
   One escapes with only being beaten with a rod, while another feels as
   it were the feet of horses in his heavy tribulations!

   Our subject is just this. Threshing. All kinds of seeds need it. All
   sorts of men need it Secondly, the threshing is done with discretion.
   And thirdly, the threshing will not last forever, for so the second
   verse of the text says, "Bread flour must be ground and, therefore, he
   does not thresh it forever, nor break it with the his cartwheel, nor
   bruise it with his horsemen." First then--

   I. WE ALL NEED THRESHING.

   Some have a foolish conceit of themselves that they have no sin--but
   they deceive themselves and the Truth of God is not in them. The best
   of men are men at the best and, being men, they are not perfect but are
   still compassed about with infirmity. What is the object of threshing
   the grain? Is it not to separate it from the straw and the chaff?

   About the best of men there is still a measure of chaff. All is not
   grain that lies upon the threshing floor. All is not grain even in
   those golden sheaves which have so joyfully been brought into our
   garner. Even the wheat is joined to the straw which was necessary to it
   at one time. About the kernel of the wheat, the husk is wrapped and
   this still clings to it even when it lies upon the threshing floor.
   About the holiest of men there is something superfluous, something
   which must be removed. We either sin by omission or by trespass. Either
   in spirit, or motive, or lack of zeal, or want of discretion we are
   faulty. If we escape one error, we usually glide into its opposite. If
   before an action we are right, we err in the doing of it--or if not, we
   become proud after it is over. If sin is shut out at the front door, it
   tries the back gate, orclimbs in at the window, or comes down the
   chimney. Those who cannot perceive it in themselves are frequently
   blinded by its smoke. They are so thoroughly in the water that they do
   not know that is rains. So far as my own observation goes, I have found
   no man whom the old divines would have called perfectly perfect--the
   absolutely all-round man is a being whom I expect to see in Heaven, but
   not in this poor fallen world! We all need such cleansing and purging
   as the threshing floor is intended to work for us.

   Now, threshing is useful in loosening the connection between the good
   corn and the husk Of course, if it would slip out easily from its husk,
   the corn would only need to be shaken. There would be no necessity for
   a staff or a rod, much less for the feet of horses or the wheel of a
   cart to separate it. But there's the rub--our soul not only lies in the
   dust, but "cleaves" to it. There is a fearful intimacy between fallen
   human nature and the evil which is in the world--and this compact is
   not soon broken. In our hearts we hate every false way and yet we
   sorrowfully confess, "When I would do good, evil is present with me."
   Sometimes when our spirit cries out most ardently after God, a holy
   will is present with us, but how to perform that which is good we find
   not! Flesh and blood have tendencies and weaknesses which if not sinful
   in themselves, yet run in that direction. Appetites need but slight
   excitement to germinate into lusts. It is not easy for us to forget our
   own kindred and our father's house even when the king does most greatly
   desire our beauty. Our alien nature remembers Egypt and the flesh-pots
   while yet the manna is in our mouths! We were all born in the house of
   evil and some of us were nursed upon the lap of iniquity so that our
   first companionships were among the heirs of wrath! That which was bred
   in the bone is hard to get out of the flesh. Threshing is used to
   loosen our hold of earthly things and break us away from evil. This
   needs a Divine hand and nothing but the Grace of God can make the
   threshing effectual. Something is done by threshing when the soul
   ceases to be bound up with its sin and sin is no longer pleasurable or
   satisfactory. Still, as the work of threshing is never done till the
   corn is separated together from the husk, so chastening and discipline
   have never accomplished their design till God's people give up every
   form of evil and abhor all iniquity. When we shake right out of the
   straw and have nothing further to do with sin, then the flail will lie
   quiet. It has taken a good deal of threshing to bring some of us
   anywhere near that mark! And I am afraid many more heavy blows will be
   struck before we shall reach the total separation! From a certain sort
   of sins we are very easily separated by the Grace of God early in our
   spiritual life, but when those are gone, another layer of evils comes
   into sight and the work has to be repeated. The complete removal of our
   connection with sin is a work demanding the Divine skill and power of
   the Holy Spirit and by Him only will it be accomplished.

   Threshing becomes necessary for the sake of our usefulness, for the
   wheat must come out of the husk to be of service. We can only honor God
   and bless men by being holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from
   sinners. O corn of the Lord's threshing floor, you must be beaten and
   bruised, or perish as a worthless heap! Eminent usefulness usually
   necessitates eminent affliction.

   Unless thus severed from sin, we cannot be gathered into the garner.
   God's pure wheat must not be defiled by an admixture of chaff. There
   shall in no wise enter into Heaven anything that defiles, therefore
   every sort of imperfection must come away from us by some means or
   other before we can enter into the state of eternal blessedness and
   perfection. Yes, even here we cannot have true fellowship with the
   Father unless we are daily delivered from sin.

   Perhaps some of us today are lying up on the threshing floor suffering
   from the blows of chastisement. What then? Why, let us rejoice therein,
   for this testifies to our value in the sight of God. If the wheat were
   to cry out and say, "The great drag has gone over me and, therefore,
   the farmer has no care for me, " we should instantly reply, "The farmer
   does not pass the corn-drag over the darner or the nettles--it is only
   over the precious wheat that he turns his cartwheel or the feet of his
   oxen. Because he esteems the wheat, therefore he deals sternly with it
   and spares it not." Judge not, O Believer, that God hates you because
   He afflicts you! But interpret truly and see that He honors you by
   every stroke which He lays upon you. Thus says the Lord, "You only have
   I known of all the nations of the earth, therefore I will punish you
   for all your iniquities." Because a full Atonement has been made by the
   Lord Jesus for all His people's sins, therefore He will not punish us
   as a judge--but because we are His dear children--therefore He will
   chastise us as a father! In love He corrects His own children that He
   may perfect them in His own image and make them partakers of His
   holiness. Is it not written, "I will bring them under the rod of the
   Covenant"? Has He not said, "I have refined you, but not with silver. I
   have chosen you in the furnace of affliction"? Therefore do not judge
   according to the sight of the eyes or the feeling ofthe flesh, but
   judge according to faith--and understand that as threshing is a
   testimony to the value of the wheat, so affliction is a token of God's
   delight in His people!

   Remember, however, that as threshing is a sign of the impurity of the
   wheat, so is affliction an indication of the present imperfection of
   the Christian. If you were no more connected with evil, you would be no
   more corrected with sorrow. The sound of a flail is never heard in
   Heaven, for it is not the threshing floor of the imperfect, but the
   garner of the completely sanctified. The threshing instrument is,
   therefore, a humbling token and, as long as we feel it, we should
   humble ourselves under the hand of God, for it is clear that we are not
   yet free from the straw and the chaff of fallen nature.

   On the other hand, the threshing instrument is a prophecy of our future
   perfection. We are undergoing from the hand of God a discipline which
   will not fail--we shall, by His prudence and wisdom, be delivered from
   the husk of sin. We are feeling the blows of the staff, but we are
   being effectually separated from the evil which has so long surrounded
   us and, for certain we shall one day be pure and perfect! Every
   tendency to sin shall be beaten off. "Foolishness is bound in the heart
   of a child, but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him." If
   we, being evil, yet succeed with our children by our poor, imperfect
   chastening, how much more shall the Father of Spirits cause us to live
   unto Himself by His holy discipline? If the corn could know the
   necessary uses of the flail, it would invite the thresher to his work!
   And since we know whereunto tribulation tends, let us glory in it and
   yield ourselves with cheerfulness to its processes! We need
   threshing--the threshing proves our value in God's sight! And while it
   marks our imperfection, it secures our ultimate cleansing! In the next
   place I would remark that--

   II. GOD'S THRESHING IS DONE WITH GREAT DISCRETION, "for the black
   cummin are not threshed with a threshing instrument." The poor little
   black cummin, a kind of small seed used for flavoring cakes, were not
   crushed out with a heavy drag, for by such rough usage they would have
   been broken up and spoiled. "Neither is a cartwheel turned about upon
   the cummin." This little seed, perhaps the caraway, would have been
   ground by so great a weight--it would have been preposterous to treat
   it in that rough manner! The black cummin were soon removed from the
   stalks by being "beaten out with a staff." And the cummin needed
   nothing but a touch of a rod. For tender seeds, the farmer uses gentle
   means, but for the hardier grains he reserves the sterner processes.
   Let us think of this as it conveys a valuable spiritual lesson.

   Reflect, my Brothers and Sisters, that your threshing and mine are in
   God's hands. Our chastening is not left to servants. much less to
   enemies--"we're chastened by the Lord!" The Great Farmer, Himself,
   personally bids the laborers do this and that, for they know not the
   time or the way except as Divine Wisdom shall direct--they would turn
   the wheel upon the cummin, or attempt to thresh wheat with a stick! I
   have seen God's servants trying both these follies--they have crushed
   the weak and tender and they have dealt with partiality and softness
   with those who needed to be sternly rebuked! How roughly some
   ministers, some Elders, some good men and women will go to work with
   timid, tender souls! Yet we need not fear that they will destroy the
   true-hearted, for however much they may vex them, the Lord will not
   leave His chosen in their hands, but will overrule their mistaken
   severity and preserve His own from being destroyed thereby! How glad I
   am of this, for there are many, nowadays, who would grind the tender
   ones to powder if they could!

   As the Lord has not left us in the power of man, so also He has not
   left us in the power of the devil. Satan may sift us as wheat, but he
   shall not thresh us as black cummin. He may blow away the chaff from us
   even with his foul breath, but he shall not have the management of the
   Lord's corn--"the Lord preserves the righteous." Not a stroke in
   Providence is left to chance--the Lord ordains it and arranges the
   time, the force and the place of it. The Divine Decree leaves nothing
   uncertain! The jurisdiction of supreme love occupies itself with the
   smallest events of our daily lives! Whether we bear the teeth of the
   corn-drag, or men ride over our heads, or we endure the gentler touches
   of the Divine hand--everything is by appointment and the appointment is
   fixed by Infallible Wisdom! Let this be a mine of comfort to the
   afflicted.

   Next, remark that the instruments used for our threshing are also
   chosen by the Great Farmer The Eastern farmer, according to the text,
   has several instruments--and so has our God. No form of threshing is
   pleasant to the seed which bears it. Indeed, each one seems to the
   sufferer to be peculiarly objectionable. We say, "I think I could bear
   anything but this sad trouble." We cry, "It was not an enemy! Then I
   could have borne it, " and so on. Perhaps the tender cummin foolishly
   fancies that the horse hoofs would be a less terrible ordeal than the
   rod--and the black cummin might even prefer the wheel to the staff--but
   happily the matter is left to the choice of One who judges unerringly!
   What do you know about it, poor sufferer? How can you judge of what is
   good for you? "Ah," cries a mother, "I would not mind poverty, but to
   lose my darling child is too terrible!" Another laments, "I could have
   parted with all my wealth, but to be slandered cuts me to the quick."
   There is no pleasing us in the matter of chastisement. When I was at
   school with my uncle, for master, it often happened that he would send
   me out to find a cane for him. It was not a very pleasant task and I
   noticed that I never once succeeded in selecting a stick which was
   liked by the boy who had to feel it! Either it was too thin or too
   stout and, in consequence, I was threatened by the sufferers with
   punishment if I did not do better next time! I learned from that
   experience never to expect God's children to like the particular rod
   with which they are chastened. You smile at my simile but you may also
   smile at yourself when you find yourself crying, "Any trouble but this,
   Lord! Any affliction but this!" How idle it is to expect a pleasant
   trial, for it would then be no trial at all! Almost every really useful
   medicine is unpleasant. Almost all effectual surgery is painful. No
   trial for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous, yet it is the
   right trial and, none the less right because it is bitter!

   Notice, too, that God not only selects the instruments, but He chooses
   the place. Farmers in the East have large threshing floors upon which
   they throw the sheaves of corn or barley--and upon these they turn
   horses and drags--but near the house door I have often noticed in Italy
   a much smaller circle of hardened clay or cement--and here I have seen
   the peasants beating out their garden seeds in a more careful manner
   than would naturally be used towards the greater heaps upon the larger
   area. Some saints are not afflicted in the common affairs of life, but
   they have peculiar sorrow in their innermost spirits. They are beaten
   on the smaller and more private threshing floor, but the process is
   none the less effectual. How foolish are we when we rebel against our
   Lord's appointment and speak as if we had a right to choose our own
   afflictions! "Should it be according to your mind?" Should a child
   select the rod? Should the grain appoint its own thresher? Are not
   these things to be left to a higher wisdom? Some complain of the time
   of their trial--it is hard to be crippled in youth or to be poor in age
   or to be widowed when your children are young. Yet in all this there is
   wisdom! A part of the skill of the physician may lie not only in
   writing a prescription but in arranging the hours at which the medicine
   shall be taken. One draught may be most useful in the morning and
   another may be more beneficial in the evening-- and so the Lord knows
   when it is best for us to drink of the cup which He has prepared for
   us. I know a dear child of God who is enduring a severe trial in his
   old age and I would gladly screen him from it because of his
   feebleness, but our heavenly Father knows best and there we must leave
   it. The instrument of the threshing, the place, the measure, the time,
   the end are all appointed by Infallible Love!

   It is interesting to notice in the text the limit of this threshing.
   The farmer is zealous to beat out the seed, but he is careful not to
   break it in pieces by too severe a process. His wheel is not to grind,
   but to thresh. The horses' feet are not to break, but to separate. He
   intends to get the cummin out of its husk, but he will not turn a heavy
   drag upon it utterly to smash it up and destroy it. In the same way the
   Lord has a measure in all His chastening. Courage, tried Friend, you
   shall be afflicted as you need, but not as you deserve! Tribulation
   shall come as you are able to bear it. As is the strength, such shall
   the affliction be--the wheat may feel the wheel, but the black cummin
   shall bear nothing heavier than a staff. No saint shall be tempted
   beyond the proper measure--and the limit is fixed by a tenderness which
   never deals a needless stroke!

   It is very easy to talk like this in cool blood, but quite another
   thing to remember it when the flail is hammering you! Yet I have
   personally realized this Truth upon the bed of pain and in the furnace
   of mental distress. I thank God at every remembrance of my afflictions.
   I did not doubt His wisdom, then, nor have I had any reason to question
   it since. Our Great Farmer understands how to divide us from the husk
   and He goes about His work in a way for which He deserves to be adored
   forever!

   It is a pleasant thought that God's limit is one beyond which trials
   never go--

   "If trials six are fixed for men They shall not suffer seven. If God
   appoints afflictions ten They never can be eleven."

   The old Law ordained forty stripes save one, and in all our scourges
   there always comes in that, "save one." When the Lord multiplies our
   sorrows up to a hundred, it is because 99 failed to effect His purpose,
   but all the powers of earth and Hell cannot give us one blow above the
   settled number! We shall never endure a superfluity of threshing. The
   Lordnever sports with the feelings of His saints. "He does not afflict
   willingly " and so we may be sure He never gives an unnecessary blow.

   The wisdom of the farmer in limiting his threshing is far exceeded in
   the wisdom of God by which He sets a limit to our griefs. Some escape
   with little trouble and, perhaps, it is because they are frail and
   sensitive. The little garden seeds must not be beaten too heavily lest
   they be injured--those saints who bear about with them a delicate body
   must not be roughly handled nor shall they be. Possibly they also have
   a feeble mind and that which others would laugh at would be death to
   them--they shall be kept as the apple of the eye!

   If you are free from tribulation, never ask for it! That would be a
   great folly. I met with a Brother a little while ago who said that he
   was much perplexed because he had no trouble. I said, "Do not worry
   about that, but be happy while you may." Only a very strange child
   would beg to be flogged! Certain sweet and shining saints are of such a
   gentle spirit that the Lord does not expose them to the same treatment
   as He metes out to others--they do not need it and they could not bear
   it--why should they wish for it?

   Others, again, are very heavily pressed, but what of that if they are a
   superior grain--a seed of larger usefulness intended for higher
   purposes? Let not such regret that they have to endure a heavier
   threshing since their use is greater. It is the bread corn that must go
   under the feet of the horseman and must feel the wheel of the cart--and
   so the most useful have to pass through the sternest processes. There
   is not one among us but what would say, "I could wish that I were
   Martin Luther, or that I could play as noble a part as he did." Yes,
   but in addition to the outward perils of his life, the inward
   experiences of that remarkable man were such as none of us would wish
   to feel! He was frequently tormented with Satanic temptations and
   driven to the verge of despair. At one hour he rode the whirlwind and
   the storm, master of all the world, and then after days of fighting
   with the pope and the devil, he would go home to his bed and lie there
   broken-down and trembling! You see God's heroes only in the pulpit or
   in other public places--you know not what they are before God in
   secret. You do not know their inner life, otherwise you might discover
   that the bread corn is bruised and that those who are most useful in
   comforting others have to endure frequent sorrow, themselves! Envy no
   man, for you do not know how he may have to be threshed to make him
   right and keep him so.

   Brothers and Sisters, we see that our God uses discretion in the
   chastisement of His people! Let us use a loving prudence when we have
   to deal with others in that way. Be gentle as well as firm with your
   children and if you have to rebuke your Brother or Sister in Christ, do
   it very tenderly. Do not drive your horses over the tender seed.
   Recollect that the cummin is beaten out with a stick and not crushed
   out with a wheel. Take a very light rod. Perhaps it would be as well if
   you had no rod at all, but left that work to wiser hands. Go and sow
   and leave your Elders to thresh!

   Next, let us firmly believe in God's discretion and be sure that He is
   doing the right thing by us. Let us not be anxious to be screened from
   affliction. When we ask that the cup may pass from us, let it be with
   a, "nevertheless not as I will." Best of all, let us freely part with
   our chaff. The likeliest way to escape the flail is to separate from
   the husk as quickly as possible. "Come you out from among them."
   Separate yourselves from sin and sinners, from the world and
   worldliness--and the process of threshing will all the sooner be
   completed! God make us wise in this matter! A word or two is all we can
   afford upon the third head, which is--

   III. THE THRESHING WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.

   The threshing will not last all our days even here--"Bread flour must
   be ground, but He will not always be threshing it." Oh, no! "For a
   small moment have I forsaken you, but with great mercies will I gather
   you." "He will not always chide, neither will He keep His anger
   forever." "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the
   morning." Rejoice, you daughters of sorrow! Be comforted, you sons of
   grief! Have hope in God, for you shall yet praise Him who is the health
   of your countenance! The rain does not always fall, nor will the clouds
   always return. Sorrow and sighing shall flee away. Threshing is not an
   operation which the corn requires all the year round--for the most part
   the flail is idle. Bless the Lord O my Soul! The Lord will yet bring
   home His banished ones.

   Above all, tribulation will not last forever, for we shall soon be gone
   to another and better world. We shall soon be carried to the land where
   there are neither threshing floors nor corn-drags. I sometimes think I
   hear the herald calling me. His trumpet sounds, "Up and away! Boot and
   saddle! Up and away! Leave the camp and the battle and return in
   triumph." The night is far spent with some of you, but the morning
   comes. The daylight breaks above yon hills. The day is coming--the day
   that shall go no more down forever! Come eat your bread with joy and
   march onward with a merry heart, for the land which flows with milk and
   honey is but a little distance before you. Until the day breaks and the
   shadows flee away, abide the Great Farmer's will, and may the Lord
   glorify Himself in you. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   PSALM 90; 119:21-32. "The prayer of Moses, the man of God."

   I think this Psalm has been very much misunderstood because the title
   has been forgotten. It is not a Psalm for us in its entirety--it cannot
   be read by the Christian and taken as it stands. It is a Psalm of Moses
   as far as Moses can get. It goes a long way, but there was a Joshua
   that lead the people into the promised land--and there is a Jesus who
   has "brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel." That light
   shines through the gloomy haze of this dark Psalm. Please remember that
   Moses was a man peculiarly tried. We have never duly given weight to
   the afflictions of Moses. All the people that he brought out of Egypt,
   with two exceptions, died. And he saw most of them die--himself having
   the sentence of death in himself that he, like the rest, must not cross
   into the Land of Promise. So that with two millions or more of people
   round about him, that forty years he stood in the Valley of the Shadow
   of Death--and with all the mercies that surrounded him, yet still he
   must have had continual sorrow of heart--all his old friends and
   companions passing away, one by one. It is a brave Psalm if you read it
   in that light--it is a grand specimen of heroic faith!

   Verse 1. Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations. All
   Your saints abide in You. Your fiery cloudy pillar covers and protects
   us.

   2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the
   earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.
   Oh, that is grand to feel that there is something stable--there is a
   Rock that never crumbles--God from everlasting to everlasting the same!
   As for us, what are we?

   3. You turn man to destruction and say, Return you children of men. A
   breath gave them life--a word makes themdie.

   4-6. For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it
   ispast and as a watch in the night. You carry them away as with a
   flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which
   grows up. In the morning it flourishes and grows up. In the evening it
   is cut down and withers. We have seen this over and over again, as we
   shall see it yet again this year in the flourishing and the cutting
   down of the grass. But we forget it for ourselves. Too often we forget
   it for our companions--we think that they are immortal where all are
   mortal. Let us correct our estimate that we may somewhat correct our
   sorrows.

   7. For we are consumed by Your anger and by Your wrath are we troublet.
   Which was true of that generation. They died because of God's anger,
   but we bless God--as many of us as have believed in Christ Jesus are
   not under the Divine anger--it is taken away. When it does fall upon
   us, it is as a father is angry with his children. It troubles and
   consumes us, but blessed be God, we usually walk in the light of His
   Countenance and joy and rejoice therein. Let us value His mercy as we
   see the misery of His wrath!

   8. You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light
   of Your Countenance. That is true of you that know not God! Your sins
   are always before His face, but it is not true of Believers. You have
   cast all their sins behind Your back. God has forgotten the sins of His
   chosen according to His own promise, "Their sins and their iniquities
   will I remember no more forever." O blessed Gospel! Moses cannot reach
   to that.

   9. For all our days are passed away in Your wrath: we spend our years
   as a tale that is told. "For all our days are passed away in Your
   wrath." So it was with those that were round about Moses, but our days
   are passed in God's goodness! They shall pass away in Infinite Love!
   "We spend our years as a tale that is told."

   10. The days of our years are three-score years and ten; and if by
   reason of strength they are fourscore years, yet is their strength
   labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly awaj. Speaking of
   the mass of men, this is all that can be said of them. But as for the
   godly, where do they fly? They fly into His bosom who has loved them
   with an everlasting love! What is death but an open cage to bid us fly
   and build our happy nests on high? Blessed be God that we do fly away!
   Have not we often wished for it and said, "O that I had the wings of a
   dove that I might fly away and be at rest"--that will come, by-and-by!

   11. Who knows the power of Your anger? Even according to Your fear, so
   is Your wratt. As He is greatly to be reverenced, so is He greatly to
   be feared. But the Lord has said of His people, "As I have sworn that
   the waters of Noah shall no more cover the earth, so have I sworn that
   I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you." Blessed be His name.

   12-14. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
   unto wisdom. Return, O LORD, how long? And let it repent You concerning
   Your servants. O satisfy us early with Your mercy; that we may rejoice
   and be glad all our days. Poor Israel was greatly afflicted. Those
   deaths in the wilderness made her a perpetual mourner! But Moses asks
   that God will return to His people cheer and encourage them and let the
   few days they have to live be bright with His Presence.

   15-17. Make us glad according to the days wherein You have afflicted us
   and the years wherein we have seen evil. Let Your work appear unto Your
   servants and Your Glory unto their children. And let the beauty of the
   LORD our God be upon us: andestablish You the work ofourhands upon
   us;yes the work ofourhands establish it

   PSALM 119:21-32.

   21. You have rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from Your
   commandments. Wherever there is pride in the heart, there is sure to be
   error in the life. A proud man is wrong to begin with and as long as he
   continues proud, he must be wrong. It is not possible for him to be
   right. God has rebuked him and God has cursed him. How wise it would be
   of him to be humble! Remember we shall have either to be humble or to
   be humbled--and it is much better to be humble than to have to come
   under the humbling dispensations of God's hand!

   22. Remove from me reproach and contempt: for I have kept Your
   testimonies. O Lord, do not suffer men to believe lies and slanders
   against me, or if they do, let my conscience sustain my courage by the
   consciousness that I have kept Your testimonies.

   23. Princes also did sit and speak against me. Had they nothing else to
   do but talk against God's servants? No, they sat down to do it with
   deliberation. "Princes also did sit and speak against me."

   23. But Your servant did--"Go to law with them?" No, not so here. "But
   your servant got in the face and defended himself?" No, no! Look, you
   will not read those words. But, "Your servant was brokenhearted about
   it to have the great men of the earth speaking against him?" No, it is
   not so either. "But your servant did"--

   23. Meditate in Your statutes. Is not that a very blessed and admirable
   way of enduring slander--simply to take your Bible and read a little
   more than usual? You will cure it so.

   24. Your testimonies also are my delight and my counselors. Because I
   love them and delight in them. I submit my life to their guidance. I go
   to Your Book to ask what I shall do. I consult it as the Oracle of God.
   I take my doubts and difficulties and dilemmas there and I find that
   they are all met. "Your testimonies are my delight and my counselors."

   25. My soul cleaves unto the dust: quicken You me according to Your
   Wore. Ah, there is a note of sadness here. The Psalmist complains of
   himself. He found himself very sorrowful and he could not get out of
   the sorrow. Or he found himself very full of business cares and he
   could not get rid of them."My soul cleaves to the dust"--as though it
   was stuck to the dust and the dust to it and could not rise. Then how
   sweet the prayer, "Quicken You me." "Did You not first make me of dust
   and will You not, at the last, quicken my mortal body out of the dust?
   Then, now, my Lord, quicken You me according to Your Word." See, here
   is an evil complained of. He finds himself cleaving to the dust. Here
   is a remedy sought, "Quicken You me." And here is an argument pleaded
   with God--"according to Your Word." There is a promise for it. Lord,
   fulfill Your Word!

   26. I have declared my ways and You heard me: teach me Your statutes. A
   confession had been made--"I have declared my ways." That confession
   had been accepted--"You heard me." Then a petition is offered--"Teach
   me Your statutes." "You see that I confess how wrong I was. Now give me
   Grace that I may not go wrong again." May that be our spirit always!

   27. 28. Make me to understand the way of Your precepts: so shall I talk
   of Your wondrous works. My soul melts for heaviness: strengthen You me
   according unto Your Wore. "I am poured out like water " says the
   Savior. "My heart is like wax. It is melted." It is the greatness of
   pain, the greatness of fear, the greatness of sorrow, till He seems to
   melt away in the fire like wax. "For heaviness " says He, "my soul
   melts. Then strengthen You, Me." Oh it is so sweet to turn to

   God when your soul is burdened--to look to Him and say--not, "deliver
   me." Observe that--the child of God is not so anxious to get rid of
   trouble as he is to know how to behave worthily under it! "Strengthen
   You, me, according to Your Word." How he harps on that, "according to
   Your Word." The child of God does not expect God to do otherwise than
   He has promised to do. And he is quite content if the Lord will act
   according to His Word, for well does our poet put it--

   "What more can He say than to you He has said-- You who unto Jesus for
   refuge have fled?'

   In this book dear Brothers and Sisters, whatever your trouble, there is
   a promise to meet it! If you lose a key and you send for the locksmith,
   as a general rule, somewhere in that bunch of keys, he has a key that
   will fit your lock. And so here is a bunch of keys and there is a key,
   here, that will exactly fit the lock of your trouble whatever it may be
   for God foresaw the circumstances of all His people and prepared a
   promise for every circumstance!

   29. Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me Your Law graciously.
   "Take away the evil, give me the good." "The way of lying." Oh it is a
   dreadful thing to get into that! There are some that have a way of
   doing it--some that do it naturally. Some that do it by implication.
   Some think it shrewd to deceive. "Remove from me the way of lying." If
   truth should be banished from all the world, it ought to find a shelter
   in the breasts of Christians! The Christian is forbidden to take an
   oath because there should never be any necessity for it. His word--his,
   "Yes yes"--his, "No no," should always be sufficient. Thank God it is
   where the Grace of God is!

   30, 31. have chosen the way of truth: Your judgments have I laid before
   me. I have stuck into Your testimonies: O LORD put me not to shame.
   Here is, first, choice--"I have chosen the way of truth." Here is his
   practically carrying it out--"Your judgments have I laid before me."
   Here is his perseverance in it--"I have stuck into Your testimonies."
   And then there is his prayer about it, "O Lord, put me not to shame."
   And it is a prayer which is sure to be answered! "Truth may be blamed
   but it cannot be shamed." Truth is God's daughter and He will take care
   of her. If you have chosen the way of truth, it is a way in which
   though some may censure and slander, your righteousness shall come
   forth in due time as the noonday!

   32. I will run the way of Your commandments when You shall enlarge my
   heart. "When I get liberty of heart, then will I take as my choice Your
   ways." The Christian is never so much at liberty as when he is under
   law to Christ. He knows the difference between license and liberty. He
   has a liberty to do as he wills because he wills to do as God wills him
   to do--and herein lies the only freedom which we desire!

The Soul's Awakening

   (No. 3389)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON.

   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming when the dead shall
   hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." John
   5:25.

   I suppose that when a pearl-fisher is at the bottom of the sea and has
   gathered his bag full of oysters, he will sometimes see other oysters
   lying about which he would be very very glad to take up if he could.
   And I can imagine that when he has been safely taken into his boat and
   has put away what he gathered the first time, he will be rather anxious
   to descend again somewhere near that same spot to bring up those which
   he left behind. This, at least, is much like my own case. While reading
   the Chapter and preparing the sermon for this morning, I thought there
   were so many pearls in the text I could not say much about this
   particular verse so I felt inclined to return to the same spot at once
   to see if we might not fetch up some fresh gems!

   Those of you who were present this morning will remember that we saw in
   the Chapter a three-fold gradation of life-giving in the Person of
   Christ. As here and there in the Old Testament dispensation, God had
   raised up some persons from the dead, so Christ, also, in the days of
   His flesh, had quickened whom He would--persons naturally dead He had
   restored to natural life. This is the first and, indeed, a very
   wonderful prerogative of live-giving for Christ to exercise to be able
   to raise Lazarus from the grave or to raise the young daughter of the
   ruler or to restore to the widow her departed son. The second form of
   life-giving is that described in the verse before us. He was constantly
   giving through His voice spiritual life to those who were spiritually
   dead. The third kind of life-giving we spoke of is that of the
   universal resurrection when all that are in the grave shall hear the
   voice of the Son of God and shall rise to judgment. It is to the second
   that we propose to direct our attention this evening--a form of
   life-giving which is going on now--not a matter of the past as was the
   raising of a few in Christ's day. Not a matter of the future as the
   coming resurrection is, but a matter of the present--not so apparent to
   the eye and to the ear as either of those mysteries, in so much that it
   is to a great extent invisible except to the man who is a participator
   in it, but just as real, just as miraculous and, in many senses, even
   more marvelous and Divine! Christ is constantly raising the spiritually
   dead and giving them life. Oh that we may be enabled by God's Spirit to
   open up this Truth of God to your understanding and may it be applied
   to your hearts! Our first endeavor shall be to describe--

   I. WHAT IT IS TO BE SPIRITUALLY DEAD.

   "The hour is coming," says the Savior, "and now is, when the dead shall
   hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live." What
   is it to be spiritually dead? You all know what it is for the body to
   be physically dead. The soul has departed and has left the body
   incapable, insensible, unable to preserve itself. The soul was like
   salt to it--that being gone, it soon becomes putrid and obnoxious. Poor
   dead body! A most terrible and humiliating spectacle to see--
   especially to look upon it after it has been lying for a while in the
   grave. We have, most of us, heard what it is to be morally dead. It
   does not happen, I hope, to very many, but there are some who seem to
   be dead to all moral feeling of right and wrong between their fellow
   men--that is what I mean just now by morality. They have been so inured
   to theft, un-cleanness, drunkenness and, some few even to murder, that
   when they have been arrested, convicted, imprisoned-- nothing seemed to
   move them to repentance! Even the dread of the last terrible penalty of
   the law has not sufficed to-bring from some of them any kind of
   emotion. Those who have been most earnest to arouse their conscience
   have felt the most painful conviction that their moral faculties were
   totally defunct. They have become callous, seared as with a hot iron.
   It is an awful spectacle to see a man morally dead--blind to reason,
   deaf to warning, numb to shame--thus morally dead. His passions raging
   without control, he becomes like some wild wolf of whom all the
   district is afraid! Like a raging lion going about in quest of prey
   whom every man dreads to encounter and whom some think it only right to
   slay. May none of us ever fall into such infamy! Alas, it might be!
   Step by step, little by little, men have become outcasts from society
   and found their lodging in the very lairs of corruption though they
   were born in better circumstances and trained with brighter prospects!
   May God grant we may never come to it ourselves!

   But to be spiritually dead--what is that? It is something like these
   two, but I think it is somewhat different. I must describe spiritual
   death not in its essence, for that I cannot do, but in its outward
   signs. Now observe a spiritually dead man. He is not dead in any other
   respect. He walks abroad and sees the fields full of abundant harvests.
   At night-fall he looks up to the skies and marks the glorious scenery
   of night. By day he climbs the mountains, beholds the valleys beneath
   in all their smiling beauty and gazes upward at the golden sun above.
   God is to be seen in all these--God manifestly the Creator, Preserver
   and Benefactor of mankind--but this man does not perceive Him. He sees
   no God. Perhaps he can stand like Byron under the shadow of Mont Blanc
   and write himself, "Atheos" without God where God is everywhere! Where
   God is in every breath of air, where God is in every flower beneath his
   feet, he sees not the footprints of the Almighty! He believes not in
   His secret Presence. Is the Great Eternal First Cause defunct, then, or
   is there no God? No, Sirs, the man's perception of God is all gone and
   that is all that is gone! His power to realize spiritual things has
   failed or else his ears would hear the voice of God in the sounding
   tops of the pines! His eyes would see the name of God written in golden
   letters in the midnight sky! His every sense would perceive God and his
   inmost soul drink deep of God--but he is dead and, therefore, he
   cannot! Watch that man in the common events of Providence. Many mercies
   have come to his store--there are happy children climbing his knee, his
   wife is in strong health and full of happiness--they have no need to
   look from where the next meal shall come. The stream of mercy flows
   hard by their door and this has been continued many years! They have
   long enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity! Now, all this comes from God,
   and health and strength are peculiarly His gifts. The power to get and
   the power to enjoy our earthly goods must both proceed from Him. But
   this man never sees God in it at all! He sometimes talks of luck and
   thinks himself a fortunate fellow. Luck, chance and fortune--these seem
   to be his deity! Though the hand of God, wide open and full of bounty,
   is so spread out that one might think a bat or an owl might see it, yet
   this man perceives it not! The man is dead to the perception of
   spiritual things that the great Master-Spirit, Himself, is not
   perceived when He comes near loaded with favors!

   As it is in Nature and as it is with the gifts of Providence, so
   especially it is in anything like outward religion. The man attends a
   place of worship--it may be he repeats his creed, joins in a form of
   prayer, or possibly he drops in where simpler worship is adopted and
   what does he do? He sings as others sing! He bows his head as others do
   in prayer. He listens as others do to the preaching of the Word, but it
   is a heavy dull monotonous service to him! He wishes it were over. He
   sees nothing in it. If he had his way and custom did not bind him at
   all, he would never he found wasting his time in such unprofitable
   proceedings as he thinks them to be! He is like the mouse in Church
   that thinks the Bibles and Prayer Books dry nibbling! He would rather
   be in the common ale-house, or at home reading novels, or walking out
   in the fields, or anywhere than in the place of worship! Yet others
   sitting by his side have found the most profound pleasure in those
   sacred engagements which have only brought weariness to him! Unlike
   him, they have been carried as on eagles' wings up to Heaven! Their
   souls have been filled with joy and peace and they have said as they
   have retired, "Surely God was in this place and it was good to be
   here." Why is this? The things ministered and the man who ministered
   them were the same. Ah, the one was dead while the others lived! How
   shall the dead derive comfort? How shall the dead be charmed? How shall
   the dead be fed and instructed? God was in the sermon but the
   carnally-minded man, being dead, perceived Him not!

   Nor, my dear Friends, is this spiritual death merely a failure to
   recognize the Being of God--it is equally seen in reference to the
   moral obligations it involves. Man, by nature, is dead to the right and
   to the true, to the commandments of the Lord which enlighten the eyes
   and to the testimony of the Lord which makes wise the simple. He is
   probably alive to his obligations to his fellow men because he has a
   clear understanding of their obligations to him. He generally keeps
   himself within the bounds of law and decency, but his greater
   obligations to his Creator--these cross not his mind--yet it is the
   very essence of rectitude and truth that He who made all things should
   be served by those He made and that He who sustains life in all His
   creatures should have honor from those creatures who owe their
   continued existence to Him! Why does the ungodly man not think of this?
   How is it he can live for 30 or 40 years sustained by God and yet never
   giveto God the service of his heart--scarcely thinking about his God at
   all? How is it? Why, because the man is dead to spiritual obligations!
   It must be so or else he would lament that he had not met those
   obligations and begin to repent that he had transgressed the bounds
   that his Maker set. The man is dead, Sirs--dead!

   Further the natural man is dead to eternal things. How quick-eared he
   is to the things of time--how swift to perceive their value and in what
   haste to grasp them if he can! But ah, the eternal realities which God
   has revealed in Scripture the man neither cares to hear about them nor,
   hearing them, do they excite any desires within his spirit! Alas, my
   Hearers, we have sometimes had to warn you of the judgment to come. We
   have had to take down the shrill-sounding trumpet and blow an alarm! We
   have had to tell you that there is a dreadful Hell into which the
   wicked, dying impenitent, must be cast! How is it that men are not
   stirred by a theme so truthful and so dreadful? Because they are dead!
   They would be awake enough if they were afraid that their house should
   be on fire and that they, themselves, might be burned with the natural
   element! Yet the spiritual danger far more to be apprehended arouses
   them not--because they are dead to it. At other times it has been our
   delight to speak of Heaven, to picture the pearly-gated city with all
   its azure brightness, with its bejeweled foundations and to talk of its
   inhabitants, all blessed forever, who walk in the light of their
   glorious King! And surely it were enough to make the cold marble heart
   glow with warmth! But no, the thing moved not men. Some little joy of
   earth would whet their appetite far more quickly! It is because to the
   spiritual Heaven revealed in Scripture men are altogether dead and care
   not for it! Oh Sirs, 'tis sad, 'tis sad, 'tis very sad that to the
   fleeting shadows we should be wide awake but to that substantial Truth
   of God we should be sound asleep--that after the poor gewgaws and
   child's bubbles of this mortal state, we should be all agog--but as to
   the solid joys and lasting pleasures of an eternal world, we show no
   desire! This again is a mark of spiritual death!

   I must hurry on to mark a few more indications of this spiritual death.
   Prayer is one of the most blessed engagements and occupations of men
   while they are out of Heaven--to ask of the All-Bountiful One the
   mercies which they need. But there are some here tonight who never
   pray--who never really ask of God what they require. They take the
   attitude of supplicants, perhaps as a matter of habit, but there they
   are like kneeling corpses! They do not pray--they are dead to prayer.
   Open this Book, this holy Bible, before them. There was never such
   another--no angel ever gazed upon a page more rich with glory than
   this! This Book it is that opens to us immortality and gives us the
   news of eternal love! Set the natural man down before it. It is to him
   a mere history or a dry book of dogmatic matters! He sees nothing in it
   that can charm him, nothing that can interest his spirit. The man is
   dead, Sir! To the sightless eyeballs, the brightest jewels flash back
   no radiance. He is dead! Yes, to Christ, Himself, the man is dead for
   when He is preached--Christ, the Father's Son, the virgin's Child, the
   condescending Savior, the ascending Conqueror, the exalted King crowned
   with Glory-- why the people of God delight to hear of Him! To them the
   savor of Jesus' name is like ointment poured forth! But exhibit this
   Savior to the natural man and he perceives nothing! How could he? He is
   dead--dead in trespasses and sins! All the outward phenomena that you
   will discern in the best natural man indicate that whatever kind of
   light there may be in him, the Light of God that deals with God, with
   the spirit-world, the world to come, is not there! He is unconscious of
   these! He has no fellowship with them. He is dead and a prey to
   corruption! When we have paused a minute we shall endeavor to
   describe--

   II. THE WORD WHICH JESUS BRINGS TO THE DEAD.

   "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
   the Son of God." Our Lord Jesus Christ is, in Scripture, especially in
   the Gospel of John, called, "the Word." Here His voice is spoken of but
   what is a voice apart from the person that utters it? What is the Word
   which Jesus speaks by which dead men are quickened? Is not Jesus
   Christ, Himself, the Word of God to man? The distinct articulate
   manifestation of Deity is Jesus Christ! Now, let me show you this.
   Jesus Christ came, once upon a time, from Heaven. He condescended to
   become a Baby, to be nursed in a manger, to hang on a woman's breast.
   He was God! What did that say--that Child, that Baby--Human, yet
   Divine? Why, it said this, "God has pity upon man and has not left him.
   He is about to establish an intimate relationship between Himself, the
   great and the glorious, and man, the weak and the pitiable--a union not
   at first between God and fully developed man, but between God and the
   Baby, as if it should be said the weakest and feeblest of all that bear
   the name of manhood may take comfort, for God has come down and taken a
   Baby's form into union with Himself!" That meant pity! It meant mercy!
   It meant fellowship and it meant hope to the race of man! To this end
   Jesus passed a life in the midst of all our sorrows, infirmities and
   took upon Himself our sickness!

   And what did that mean? Why it meant compassion. A beautiful word,
   that--compassion--a united passion, a fellow-feeling, a kindred
   suffering! It seemed to say, "God is not indifferent to your woes. Oh,
   sons of men! You have fallen through your sins, but God pities you! God
   feels for you! He is no flinty-hearted Jupiter who sits serenely on his
   throne amidst the pains and agonies and eternal death of his creatures!
   No, but He has come down to you! He has taken upon Himself, Manhood,
   that He may suffer with man and let man see that He has not left him,
   but that He feels for him! And after He had lived a life of holiness
   which was, indeed, comparatively but a small part of His work, our Lord
   Jesus Christ gave Himself up to die!Into the Garden He went and there
   the wrath of God was laid upon Him till that precious cluster was so
   crushed in the awful press of the Divine Wrath that great red drops of
   bloody sweat were distilled from every pore like the red juice from the
   cluster! He went to Pilate's Hall, to Herod's tribunal, to be mocked
   and scourged and spat upon and, at last, in extreme agony He offered up
   His life on the accursed tree! What did He say to us then? He said
   this--"God is just. I come down to you poor mortal men and, taking upon
   Myself your nature and taking also your sins as your Substitute, I have
   to suffer." Christ Jesus' suffering is a loud word from God to this
   effect, "I pity you men, but your sins I must punish. I cannot pass
   them by. If they are laid upon My Son, I must prostrate My Son beneath
   their load. I cannot wink at sin though it is laid upon the perfect
   Substitute, for even there I must hunt it to the death! It is an
   accursed thing and must not be tolerated. I must stamp it out of My
   universe."

   This is God's Word. He says, "Justice as well as compassion. Pity but
   pity consistent with severity." Moreover Jesus rose again from the dead
   and now He ever lives at the right hand of God and His Holy Spirit has
   come and animates, at this time, the preaching of the Word with Divine
   energy! Christ now declares to us God's Word after this fashion,
   "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. Whoever
   will trust in the Incarnate Son of God and fully rely upon the merits
   of His wondrous suffering shall be saved. God wills not the death of
   the sinner, but had rather that he should turn unto Him and live! And
   everyone that will turn unto the living God and trust His Son to make
   propitiation, shall be saved from the damning power of sin and have
   everlasting life." Christ, the Living One, is God's Word to us that we
   shall be delivered from the wrath to come if we trust in Him, even as
   He, Himself, was delivered when He rose again from the dead and
   ascended into Glory!

   My dear Friends, the Gospel which I preach again, tonight, is that
   which I have always preached and always will preach until I have a fear
   lest I should preach till you are almost nauseated with the repetition!
   Yet if it were so, I could not help it, for no other name do I dare to
   preach, nor is there any other foundation that I dare to lay and bid
   you build on it but this! Jesus Christ, the Son of God has come! Here
   on earth He lived and died and suffered for the sake of mankind. God is
   a God of Love, but He is also a God of Justice. There is a way in which
   He can be just and yet tender to you. If you trust His dear Son, your
   sins shall not destroy you! Christ's sufferings shall stand instead of
   yours and you shall live! If you will now accept Christ. If you now
   will lean fully on Jesus. If you now will fling away both your love of
   sin and your love of your own righteousness and come and rest where God
   would have you rest, God shall be reconciled to you and you shall be
   His child and you shall live forever and ever! I must now close with
   third point--

   III. THE MODE BY WHICH THIS WORD IS APPLIED.

   "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear." I have told
   you what they will hear. They will hear the Word of God! But who will
   speak it? Who is it that alone can speak it to purpose? Why--"When the
   dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, they that hear shall
   live." Whenever any dead soul lives, it is through the Word, but it is
   not through the voice of the preacher. That is but an instrument and
   nothing more! The real voice that makes dead souls live is the voice of
   Christ Jesus! What, is it so? Does He actually speak to every soul that
   is saved? He does! I do not mean in fancy as though you heard voices in
   the air, but I mean that this Word which I have just now preached to
   you must come home to your heart and your conscience and be applied by
   the Holy Spirit so that you prove its power and feel its energy.
   Through the Holy Spirit, it is that the voice of Christ is heard in the
   soul! But while I speak to you thus, some will say, "What, then, can we
   do with sinners as we have not the voice that can raise them?" Why you
   can pluck your Master by the skirt and say to Him, "Good Lord, speak
   the Word! Speak the Word!" When I come into this pulpit, the prayer
   that rises to my heart always--I hope I can always say without
   guile--is this, "Lord be here to speak, Yourself, through me." I am
   persuaded that though I preach to dead sinners ten thousand years,
   never will one be saved by my voice. Why, then, do I preach to sinners
   knowing them to be dead? Because I am simply the instrument of Christ
   and He speaks through His voice with His own Spirit, which is as His
   voice, and the dead do hear and they are made to live--not without the
   instrumentality, not through the instrumentality, alone, but by the
   voice of Jesus Christ! I ask you, then, dear Brothers and Sisters who
   are alive to God, to pray that Jesus would speak while the preacher
   speaks. Be lifting up your hearts and silently crying--

   "Oh, let the dead now hear Your voice! Bid, Lord Your banished ones
   rejoice! Their beauty this their glorious dress Jesus the Lord our
   righteousness.!'

   What encouragement there is in this for you, my Brothers and Sisters!
   However feeble you may be in yourselves, yet if it is the voice of
   Christ you have to rely upon, what power there is in that! You may go
   to your class and say, "I cannot teach these troublesome boys and these
   inattentive girls! How can I hope to see them saved?" Ah but your
   Master can speak through you and He can do what you cannot! Though it
   is true that old Adam is too strong for young Melancthon, he is not too
   strong for the mighty Savior whose voice does not merely speak to the
   living, but to the dead--and all who hear that voice shall live! Bend
   your ear, then, and bow down your heart! Attend to the voice of Christ
   seeing that thereby, alone, the dormant faculties can be quickened and
   a lively interest excited!

   Yet while Christ speaks to the dead, power is communicated to them that
   they may have it and use it, call it their own and exercise it. "The
   dead shall hear," and do notice, " They that hear shall live." You must
   not imagine that man is passive in the matter. What does it say, "Draw
   us, " and we will be drawn? No, but, "Draw us and we will run after
   You'" There comes an activity. I have heard some speak of faith and
   repentance as the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Most truly so they are, but
   why speak of these gifts as though the sinner had nothing to do to
   repent and to believe? Always remember that it is youwho must repent
   and believe. The Holy Spirit will not repent for you! What would He
   repent about? He never did wrong. And the Holy Spirit will not believe
   for you. What would He believe for? He is God, Himself! The fact is
   that the Apostle has expressed it exactly when he says, "Work out your
   own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that works in you
   to will and to do of His own good pleasure." Christ gives the voice but
   the man hears. There is something done--there is a something to be
   received. It is no great act to hear a sound when it is made. It is no
   great act to receive mercy when it is presented. Yet the hearing is a
   miracle, for the dead hear! And the receiving by faith is a miracle,
   for none do this but those to whom it is given--yet it is done by man.
   Faith and repentance are gifts of God--the voice that saves is the
   voice of Christ but the point of personal salvation is reached when the
   man actively hears and receives the Truth of God!

   I pray you, then, my dear Hearers, if you would be saved, be diligent
   in hearing the Gospel! I would urge you to frequent those places of
   worship most where there is most of Christ preached. Do not seek after
   eloquence, oratory, gaudy periods or grotesque observations that might
   amuse you. You have something else to do on the Lord's Day besides
   being amused and having your ears tickled! There is a soul in you that
   will either be saved or lost--and this day is given you peculiarly that
   you may listen to the Gospel which saves you! Hunt out the Gospel in
   your locality! Follow it wherever you may hear it preached. I entreat
   you to hear it, but do not think that the mere hearing it with your
   outward ears will be enough! Alas, such a hearing may involve
   responsibility and bring you no blessing. I pray you ask the Lord as
   you go up to the House of Prayer to open your inward ears to quicken
   you from your spiritual death and give you to derive profit. I do
   believe, my dear Friends, that few will miss a blessing who hear a
   Gospel minister anxiously desiring to get a blessing. In these waters,
   men shall catch what they fish for! And if you seek earnestly after
   God's blessing, you shall find it! Thirst for it! Pant for it! Long for
   it! You already have the beginning of it, for to desire Grace is an
   evidence that you have Grace in a measure! And to earnestly seek Christ
   is already to have something from Christ--a foretaste of the feast they
   enjoy who find Him!

   Ah, my dear Friends, we keep on preaching and you keep on coming and
   going, Sunday after Sunday, but how is it with you? Are you saved or
   not? A man opens a shop for the sale of medicines and I will suppose
   them to have great medicinal virtue. There is a plague in the district
   and he asks himself, "Are these drugs, after all, what they profess to
   be?" If men keep on dying, he will, as an honest man, begin to get
   anxious and to enquire. And if he meets with persons who are talking of
   other things, he will say, "Nonsense! Put them aside a bit. I want to
   ask you about something of more importance. Are these drugs of mine
   true shots with which to do battle with the plague? Are these the
   weapons with which to chase away this horrible disease and avert the
   threat? Is the plague increasing in your street or is it dying out?" Oh
   I wantto push these questions home to you tonight! I know I preach the
   Word of Christ. I am sure I have told you the Gospel of His salvation.
   The voice of Christ I cannot imitate nor would I if I could. 'Tis His
   to use His own voice. His tongue and His tongue, only, is like a
   two-edged sword which can cut and cure, kill and heal at the same time!
   How is it with you? Are you saved? Are you awakened? Are you seeking?
   Are you finding? Or are you, after all, just hearing and hearing and
   hearing again and again to no purpose? Ah, I would to God that I were
   not the preacher to such as you and that you were not my hearers, for I
   cannot bear that I should be adding to your condemnation! That I should
   be hardening you-- for so it must be--hardening your hearts with the
   very Truth of God that ought to soften them! I pray the Master bring
   you into a different state and give you to lay hold on these things,
   for if they are not true, it is time I had done preaching them! But if
   they are true, it is time you had received them! If they are not true,
   it is time that these services were given over, for they are awful
   farces! But if this Book is true and Christ's Gospel is true, it is
   time that you did not make farces of them but that you turned unto God
   with full purpose of heart! The Lord save you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EPHESIANS2; MATTHEW 11:1-6.

   Verse 1. And you has He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins.
   What a great change, then, has taken place in the people of God! It is
   described as being similar to the resurrection of the dead. And do you
   suppose that this took place without a man's knowing it? Do you think
   that we are wrong in stating a wide difference between the quickened
   ones and the dead? I think not. In fact, those addresses made to
   congregations in which there is no distinction made between the living
   and the dead in Zion are deceptive. And prayers that are meant to suit
   congregations of mingled character--where some are dead in sin and
   others alive unto God--are, on the very face of them, an attempt at an
   impossibility! As great as is the distinction between the dead in their
   graves and living men that walk the streets, so great is the difference
   between the regenerate and unregenerate! Do you think that in reading
   this verse, dear Friends, you could apply it to yourself, "and you, and
   you, and you, has He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins"?

   2. Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this
   world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that
   now works in the children of disobedience. Those who are not saved have
   a life of evil. They are dead towards God, but they are alive towards
   Satan. An unregenerate man's heart is Satan's workshop in which he
   forges divers devices of evil--the spirit that works in the children of
   disobedience!

   3. Among whom also we all had our conversation in timespast in the
   lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
   mind; and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. No
   difference by nature between the brightest saint in the Church of God
   and the blackest sinner of the camp of Satan--all fallen, all
   desperately depraved at our very original! What wonders of Grace are
   those who are saved! Let them taken care that they never fail in
   praising that Grace of God!

   4-7. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He
   loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together
   with Christ (by Grace you are saved). And has raised us up together and
   made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That in the
   ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His Grace in His
   kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. God's great objective is to
   display His Grace--to let all the universe know what a gracious God He
   is--therefore did He pitch upon us who were dead in sin even as others!
   Therefore does He quicken us and, therefore, having quickened us, does
   He go on to raise us up from one point to another until He makes us sit
   with Christ upon His Throne! Oh Beloved, if all the ages are to learn
   the Grace of God from His dealings towards us, let us learn it and let
   us talk much of it and exult much in it! Who is a gracious God like
   unto our God?

   8. For by Grace are you savedNot by your own merits! Not by
   priestcraft! Not by your own free will. "By Grace are you saved." This
   is the great summary of the Gospel! Let this Doctrine be preached and
   we shall soon see the errors of Rome fly before it! "By Grace are you
   saved."

   8. Through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.
   Neither the faith nor the salvation are of ourselves. They are both the
   gifts of Divine Love--both worked in us by the Divine Spirit. It is the
   gift of God!

   9, 10. Not of works lest any man should boast. For we are His
   workmanship. No good man can boast of his works because those works are
   the work of God. Without Him, we could not perform good works! So that
   even when we possess them, we are His workmanship. Shall the vessel on
   the wheel exalt itself as if it made itself? No, the potter must have
   the credit for all the skill of the making of the vessel. And if,
   therefore, there shall be in our character marks and lines of Grace and
   Truth--unto God be the glory for them, for we are His workmanship!

   10-12. Created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before
   ordained that we should walk in them. Therefore remember that you,
   being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh who are called Uncircumcision
   by those who are called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands.
   That at the time you were without Christ, being aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants ofpromise
   having no hope and without God in the world This is where our fathers
   were. This is where we are by nature! We have not got even as far as
   the Jew who had a Covenant according to the flesh to plead and had
   received the sign of it while yet a child! But we--we were altogether
   foreigners and aliens from the Most High!

   13. But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made
   near by the blood of Christ. Oh, rejoice in this! You far-off ones made
   near, lift up your hearts in thankfulness for what the Lord Jesus has
   done for you by His blood-- made near by the blood of Christ!

   14. For He is our peace who has made both one and has broken down the
   middle wall of partition between us. Christ is peace between Jew and
   Gentile--peace between both of them and their God. I have heard of a
   poor bricklayer who when at work on a scaffold, fell from a great
   height and was taken up and was dying. They sent for a minister of the
   Gospel who began addressing him in such terms as this, "My dear man,
   you are evidently near to die and therefore I exhort you to make your
   peace with God." He knew but very little of it compared with what the
   poor bricklayer knew, for opening his eyes, he said, "Make my peace
   with God, Sir? That I could not do, but I thank God it was made for me
   in the Everlasting Covenant of Grace in the Person of the Lord Jesus
   Christ 1,800 years ago! I have no peace to make!" It is peace already
   made! And we have but to accept it, for He is our peace who has made
   both one and broken down the middle wall of partition between us!

   15. 16. Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in Himself of two,
   one new man so making peace. And that He might reconcile both unto God
   in one body by the Cross having slain the enmity thereby. No enmity now
   should exist between Jew and Gentile. None does exist between the
   Believer and his God. The enmity is dead forever, for Christ has died.

   17, 18. And came and preached peace to you which were afar of and to
   them that were near. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit
   unto the Fathe. In this verse you have the whole Trinity and all the
   Trinity in unity are necessary for prayer. "Through Him we both have
   access by one Spirit unto the Father."

   19. Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow
   citizens with the saints and of the household of God. How blessedly
   Grace annihilates all national distinction! Cowper spoke of nations
   which, like kindred drops, would have melted into one if they had not
   been divided by a range of mountains or intersected by a narrower
   faith. But in the Gospel of Grace we do melt into one! Whoever loves
   the Lord is a co-patriot with all who love Him! Distinctions of
   nationality sweetly sink when we come to know the Savior. We are fellow
   citizens with the saints and of the householdof God!

   MATTHEW 11:1-6.

   Verses 1-5. And it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of
   commanding His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and preach
   in their cities. Now when John had heard in the prison, the works of
   Christ, he sent two of hisdisciples. And they said unto Him, Are You He
   that should come or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said
   unto them, Go and show John again those things which you do hear and
   see: The blind receive their sight and the lame walk. The lepers are
   cleansed and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up and the poor have
   the Gospel preached to them. These were Christ's seals and proofs--John
   needed not to seek others. These were the very works of which prophecy
   had said would be the marks of the Messiah! If, then these marks were
   found in Him, He left John and his disciples to draw the inference that
   He was, indeed, the One who was to come! Christ is always best known by
   His works and, especially in His people, He is seen in their lives.
   There are two great precepts for the conquest of the world for
   Christ--the first is preach the Gospel--but the second is live the
   Gospel and if we do not live the Gospel, we shall not succeed in
   preaching the Gospel! In fact, those members of our churches who do not
   live the Gospel, undo through all the week what the preacher of the
   Gospel endeavors to do on the Lord's Day! It is a fine thing to preach
   with your mouth, but the best thing in the world is to preach with your
   feet and with your hands--in your walk and in your work! And if you are
   enabled to do this, the people will be able to say very little against
   the preaching of the Gospel when they see the result of it in those who
   accept it! God grant that we may be all preachers in some way or
   another! 6. And blessed is he who is not offended because of Mt.

Hoping in God's Mercy

   (No. 3390)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 22, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 16, 1868.

   "Behold, the eye of the Lordis on those who fear Him, on those who hope
   in His mercy." Psalm 33:18.

   By the term, "the fear of God," we understand in Holy Scripture the
   whole of true religion. We do not mean by the fear of God, the slavish
   fear which trembles in God's Presence, as the poor slave trembles under
   his master's lash, but that child-like fear which fears to offend,
   which fears to be led into error--a reverential fear such as the angels
   have when they veil their faces with their wings and cast their crowns
   before the glorious Throne of God--to have such a fear of God before
   our eyes as to restrain our wandering passions, to keep our hands from
   doing evil and our tongues from speaking the thing which is not
   right--to have such a fear of God that we feel as though we were in
   God's Presence and act, and speak, and think as though we fully
   recognized the eye that reads the secrets of the heart. When we read,
   therefore, that the eye of the Lord is upon "them that fear Him," we
   are to understand that He has gracious regard towards those who delight
   in Him, who worship Him and are His children.

   But the part of the text to which I call your special attention now is
   that expression, "Those who hope in His mercy." This is intended to be
   of the same reach and compass as the first. Those who fear God are the
   same persons as those who hope in His mercy and this is very consoling,
   for to hope in God's mercy seems to be but a very small evidence of
   Divine Grace and yet it seems to be a very sure sign, for those who
   hope in God's mercy are the same persons who are said to fear Him. They
   are the same persons as are described as being His saved ones, His
   children--the truly godly ones.

   I hope there are many here who can say, "Well, I do hope in His mercy.
   If I cannot get farther, yet I can get as far as that--my hope is fixed
   in the mercy of God in Jesus Christ." Then, dear Friend, may the words
   we shall speak be comforting to you! And may you rejoice that the Lord
   considers you and has an eye of favor towards you, now, and will have
   forever!

   I am always very anxious about those who have the beginnings of Grace
   in them. I think I would go a long way out of my way to carry one of
   the lambs in my bosom and to try to cherish one that was ready to die
   with doubt. But, on the other hand, I am always fearful of giving any
   encouragement to those who are on a wrong foundation. Like the ancient
   mariner who was afraid of the whirlpool on the one hand and the rocks
   on the other, and found it difficult to steer along the middle of the
   channel, so may I find it tonight. I would not grieve a trembling soul.
   I would not bolster up a self-deceived one. Far be it from these lips
   to ever become a rod for the backs of God's weak ones! And equally far
   be it from this tongue to speak so as to put pillows under men' s arms
   and under their heads wherewith they may go to sleep and sleep
   themselves into Hell!

   In trying, therefore, to avoid two evils, I shall begin by speaking
   about a hope in God's mercy which is false--and then I shall say a
   little about a sound hope in God' s mercy. To begin, then, at the
   beginning--

   I. THERE IS A FALSE HOPE IN GOD'S MERCY AGAINST WHICH WE EARNESTLY WARN
   YOU.

   "I do not believe," says a man, "that God will ever cast me into Hell,
   for God Almighty is very merciful." "What will become of you when you
   die?" said one man to another. "I do not know," was the answer, "and I
   do not think much about it because I know that God is a very good
   God--and I do not think that He will cast the souls of men into Hell,
   as bigots say, and cause them to be forever banished from His
   Presence." Now, Friend, if this is your hope, I beseech you to be rid
   of it, for it is a deadly viper and though you nurse and cherish it in
   your bosom, it will sting you to your destruction, for do you not know
   that the God of the Bible is a God of Justice, as well as a God of
   Mercy? Though He is infinitely good, yet He Himself has said, "I will
   by no means spare the guilty."

   What do you think of this text, "The wicked shall be turned into Hell,
   and all the nations that forget God"? Does that seem as if God would
   not punish sin? "The soul that sins, it shall die." What do you think
   of that? "These shall go away into everlasting punishment." Does that
   seem like an effeminate and sentimental kindness that will wink at sin?
   If you are to be saved by the general mercy of God, then let me tell
   you that this blessed Book of God is all a mistake and deception, for
   there are no such teachings here, as those of which you dream. Besides,
   you know better than this--I appeal to your own conscience, you know
   better than this!

   We tell people that if they allow filth to accumulate and sewage to
   become stagnant. If they deprive themselves of fresh air and neglect
   ventilation and cleanliness, when the fever comes it will be sure to
   make them its prey! And they might say, "Oh, we don't believe that! God
   is merciful and we do not believe that He will ever let the fever take
   people off by scores--we shall not think of clearing away the dung
   heaps, or cleaning out the sewers, or getting the windows made to open!
   We tell you it is all bigoted trash! God will not let the people die of
   fever!" But they do die of fever and the very people who neglect the
   laws of health are taken away, God's mercy notwithstanding! And so it
   will be with you. Sin is like a dung heap--your iniquities are like
   those fever-breeding drains and your soul will die of the disease which
   springs from the sin which you so much love. And all your talk about
   God's mercy you will find to be a dream! If a man shall go to sea
   tomorrow in a leaky ship which takes in the water while she is going
   down the Thames, they may keep the pumps always going, but yet the
   water gets ahead of the men. You say to the man, "Sir, if you go out
   into the sea--it is only a matter of time--your ship will go down. She
   is not seaworthy--she will never get down the Channel." "Oh," he says,
   "don' t tell me that--God Almighty is merciful and He will never let a
   poor fellow drown! I believe that my ship will float and I mean to run
   the risk of it, for I believe in God's mercy." Down the vessel
   goes--and the wretch on board of her and all her passengers are
   drowned! And what do we say? Do we say that God is not merciful? No!
   But we say that some men are insane--and so say we of you! If you trust
   in that general mercy of God, but will not obey the Gospel and put from
   you the way of salvation which God has ordained, you will perish! And
   on your own head will be your blood since you have foolishly perverted
   the goodness of God to your own destruction!

   In other persons, this belief in the mercy of God takes the shape of
   saying, " Well, I have always done my best. I have been a respectable
   person ever since I can recall--I bring up my children as well as I
   can--I send them to the Sunday school. I always pay my debts. I don't
   swear and I am not a gin drinker--I don't know that I have any
   particular vice. On the contrary, I am always ready and happy to help
   the poor and to say a good word for religion and so on. It is true that
   I am not all I ought to be--no doubt we are all sinners and there is a
   great deal that is wrong and imperfect about us--though I don' t know
   what it is in particular. But anyhow, God is merciful and what with
   what I have done and what I have not done--and God's mercy to make up
   for all the shortcomings--I do not doubt but what it will be all right
   with me at the last." Now this, again, is a deceit and a refuge of
   lies--a bowing wall and a tottering fence which will fall on those who
   take shelter behind it!

   You have read of Nebuchadnezzar's image which was part iron and part
   clay. Had it been all iron, it might have stood, but being part clay,
   by-and-by, the whole image was broken in pieces! Such is your religion!
   You trust in part to the mercy of God--I will call that the iron. But
   you trust in part to your own so-called good works--that is the clay
   and down your image will fall before long! Why, you are like the man in
   the proverb who tries to sit on two stools--and you know what becomes
   of him! Besides, how foolish you are to try to yoke yourselves to God
   to help Him! Go and yoke a gnat with an archangel, or find a worm and
   put it side by side with leviathan--and hope that they will plow the
   stormy deep together! Then think of Christ helping you and of you
   helping Christ. Absurd! If you are to be saved by works, then it must
   be all of works! But if by Grace, it must be all of Grace, for the two
   will no more mix than fire and water. They are two contrary principles!
   Therefore, give up the delusion! A hope in God's mercy which is twisted
   and inter-twisted with a hope in your own works is certainly vain!

   But we know others who say, "Well said, Mr. Preacher! I know better
   than that--I shall never fall into that snare. I trust in the blood and
   righteousness of Jesus Christ and in Him, alone! I expect the mercy of
   God to come to me through Christ and I depend upon only Him." Well, you
   talk very well. You talk very well. I must go home with you! But the
   man does not want me to go home with him. I do not know where he means
   to turn in--perhaps once or twice on the roadbefore he gets to his
   house! When he gets home, we shall ask his wife what sort of a man he
   is. She will then be compelled to say, "Well, Sir, he is a great saint
   on Sunday, but he is a great devil all the rest of the week! He can
   talk a horse's head off about religion, but, Sir, there is no genuine
   living in the matter--no real, righteous, godly action in him."

   Did you never read of Mr. Talkative in The Pilgrim's Progress?How he
   could tell out all the Doctrines! How he could prate about them! He had
   them all at his fingertips and at his tongue's tip, too, but they never
   operated on his life. They never affected and sweetened his character.
   He was just as big a rogue as though Christ had never lived--and just
   as graceless a villain as though he had never heard of the Savior at
   all! Now, Sirs--any kind of faith in Christ which does not change your
   life is the faith of devils! And it will take you where devils are, but
   will never take you to Heaven! Men are not saved by their works--we
   declare that plainly enough--but if faith does not produce good works,
   it is a dead faith and it leaves you a dead soul to become corrupt and
   to be cast out from the sight of the Most High. A genuine hope in God's
   mercy, according to the teaching of Scripture, purifies a man. "He that
   has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure." If you have
   a hope in the mercy of God which lets you do as the ungodly do with
   impunity, then, Sir, you have about your neck a millstone that will
   sink you lower than the lowest Hell! God deliver you from such a
   delusion!

   I fear there are still others who have a bad hope--a hope which will
   not save them--because they trust in the mercy of God that they shall
   be all right at the last, though they have neglected all those things
   which make men right. For instance, the Word of God says, "You must be
   born-again." These men have never been born-again, but yet they trust
   in the mercy of God! Sir, what right have you to expect any mercy when
   God has no mercy, except that which He shows to men by giving them new
   hearts and right spirits? You say you trust in the mercy of God and yet
   you have no repen-tance--and do you think God will forgive the man who
   not only does not love, but refuses and despises His Son, the only
   Savior? I tell you there will have to be a new Bible written before
   this can be true! And there will have to be a new Gos-pel--yes--and a
   new God, too, for the God of the Bible never will, nor can wink at sin!
   Unless He makes you sick of sin, He must be sick of you! And until you
   hate your iniquities with a perfect hatred, there cannot be mercy in
   God's heart to you, for you go on in your iniquities!

   You tell me you trust in God, and yet there has been no change of life
   in you! Oh, Sirs! Unless you are converted and become as little
   children, you shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven! The first
   thing God's mercy will do for you will be to turn your face in the
   opposite direction.

   If mercy shall ever come to you, it will make you a new creation, give
   you new loves, new hates. But if you have not conversion, what have you
   to do with mercy? The mercy of God, wherever it comes, makes men pray.
   You never bend your knees and yet you say you trust in God' s mercy?
   Oh, Sir, you are deceiving your own soul!

   The mercy of God makes a man love Christ and makes him seek to be like
   Christ. You have no love to Christ and no desire to be like He. Then,
   Sir, I pray you give up that falsehood, which has been, up to now, as a
   soft pillow for your head, and believe me that the mercy of God cannot
   come in the way in which you expect it!

   I wish I might have torn away, from some now present, their false
   dependences, but I am afraid they are too dear to them for my hands to
   do it! May God's Holy Spirit deliver men from all false confidences in
   God's mercy! But now a much more pleasant part of my work comes before
   me, namely--

   II. TO DESCRIBE A SOUND HOPE IN THE MERCY OF GOD.

   I shall say of it, first, that a soundly hopeful soul feels its need of
   mercy. It does not talk about sin, but it feels it. It does not talk
   about mercy, but it groans after it. Beware of superficial religion! I
   think if I might only say two things before I die, one out of the two
   would be--beware of surface godliness. Take care of the paint, the
   tinsel, the varnish, the oil! There must be in us a hungering and a
   thirsting after righteousness! There must be in us the broken heart and
   the contrite spirit. I like revivals--far be it from me to ever say a
   word against them--but I have seen scores of men jump into religion
   just as men jump into a bath--and then jump out, again, just as quickly
   because they have not felt their deep need of Christ.

   You may depend upon it, there is no sound bottom to a man's religion
   unless he begins with a broken heart. And that religion that does not
   begin with a deep sense of sin, and a thorough heartbreaking
   conviction, is a repentance that will have to be repented of before
   long. God save us from it! If you are to have a hope in mercy, you must
   know that it is mercy! You must know that you need it as mercy! You
   must be clean divorced from every confidence except in mercy! Youmust
   come to this, that it must be Grace first, last, and midst--Grace
   everywhere--otherwise it will never serve or save such a poor helpless
   castaway as you are. A sound hope, then, is one in which a man knows
   that he needs mercy!

   Another mark of a sound hope is that he clearly perceives that mercy
   can only come to him through the Mediator-- Christ Jesus. The Word of
   God tells us that there is but one door of Grace, and that is Christ!
   But one foundation for a genuine hope--and that foundation is Christ1
   God's mercy is Infinite, but it always flows to men through the golden
   channel of Jesus Christ, His Son! Soul, it will be a good thing for you
   when you have done with the idea of hunting after mercy here, there and
   everywhere, and when you come to Christ, and Christ alone, for it! God
   swears by Himself that there shall be no hope for man out of Christ,
   but that there shall be hope for them there. "Other foundation can no
   man lay than that which is laid." Against all other confidences God
   thunders out that famous sentence, "He that believes not, in condemned
   already, because he has not believed on the Son of God." When you are
   tied up to Christ. When every other door is shut and barred, and
   fastened up with iron padlocks. When every cistern is broken. When
   every hope is shipwrecked and the last broken board has been swallowed
   up in the whirlpool of despair--if your soul then clings to
   Chr-ist--you have a sound hope, a hope that can never let you go!

   Yet again. That hope which leads a man to desire to be conformed to
   God's plan of mercyis a sound hope. I mean this. There may be someone
   here who says, "I fear I am not regenerated. You condemned me just now,
   Sir, but oh, I wish I were! I am afraid I am not converted, but oh,
   that God in His Grace would convert me! You spoke of repentance--I fear
   I do not repent as I should, but oh, I wish that I could repent! Oh,
   that my heart would break! I feel because I do not feel and I sigh
   because I cannot sigh!" Ah, poor Soul, if you are willing to be what
   God would make you to be, then is your hope, though not yet a perfect
   one, yet good so far as it goes! If you will now come and cast yourself
   on Christ, though you have no regeneration apparent to yourself, yet
   you shall be saved! If you will come as you are, with all your
   iniquities about you, without any repentance that you can discern. If
   you will come empty-handed and cast yourself on what Jesus did upon the
   Cross and is still doing in pleading before the Throne of God, you
   shall never perish, but you shall be saved!

   Oh, it is a precious Gospel which we have to preach to needy sinners! A
   full Christ for empty sinners! A free Christ for sinners that are
   enslaved! But you must be willing to be this--you must be willing to be
   renewed in the spirit of your mind--and if you can honestly say that
   you are so willing and that you will now close in with Christ, then
   yours is the hope upon which God looks with the kindest regard!

   I might thus continue to describe this hope, but I shall not detain you
   longer upon that point. I do hope and trust that I have many here who
   are beginning to have a little hope in Christ. Oh, it is a mercy to see
   the first streaks of daylight, for the sun is rising. It is pleasing to
   see that first dewdrop, the first tear that comes from a troubled
   heart. I think the Lord is about to bring water out of the flinty rock!
   I feel so grateful when I meet with some in distress. Sometimes after
   the service there is somebody that wants to see us. They are so
   distracted and depressed--and they think they are giving us so much
   trouble, but oh, it is blessed trouble! There is not one of us but
   would be glad to sit up all night, I am sure, to see many such troubled
   ones, if we might but speak a word to them by which they might find joy
   and peace!

   Now, I want to take the text like a very sweet and dainty morsel and
   just drop it into the mouths of you who are ready to faint for it--"The
   eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him, upon those who hope in His
   mercy." Though you have got no further than that, yet you have God's
   eye upon you and you may be greatly comforted! But we must go to
   another point with great brevity. We have in this house of worship,
   here and now--

   III. SOME WHO ARE AFRAID TO HOPE IN GOD.

   They unconsciously desire to trust Him in His own appointed way. They
   understand it, but they are afraid to do it. Now, my beloved fellow
   sinner, I beseech you to cast yourself upon Christ and to trust in Him!
   And remember that God cannot lie. It is blasphemy to suppose that God
   can say a thing that is not true. Now, He has promised, over and
   overagain, to save everyone that trusts in Christ. And if He does not
   save you, well, then_. You know what I mean. Oh,but God cannot lie!
   Therefore, come and cast yourself upon His faithful promise! Well do I
   remember when that text, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall
   be saved," stayed my fainting soul for months together, before I
   actually had joy and peace. Do you call upon God in prayer? Do you
   trust in God, however little it may be? Then you shall be saved!
   Believe it. If any soul here feels himself to be as black as
   night--imagines himself to be out of the list of the hopeful--yet if he
   can but come and cast himself upon what Christ did when He died upon
   the Cross for sinners, God must cease to be God before that soul can
   perish! Hope then, hope then, Sinner, for God cannot lie!

   Then hope, again, because God has saved and is still saving others! We
   have not ceased to have conversions in this Church. I am sometimes
   afraid that they are not as many as they once were, but they do come
   and come frequently, too, to the praise of God's Grace! Now, if others
   are saved when they trust Christ, why should not you be? Who has
   clambered up into the secret chambers of Heaven and found that your
   name is not written in the roll of election? Who? Why, no one has done
   so! Then, since Christ bids you come and trust Him--come and trust Him!
   Oh, that you might come, tonight, and as He has accepted others, He
   will accept you, for He says, "He that comes unto Me, I will in no wise
   castout."

   I beseech you have hope, again, because it is to Gods honor to save
   sinners. If it were dishonoring to Christ to receive the ungodly, you
   might stand in doubt. But since it is one of the jewels in His crown
   which gladdens His heart and brings Him honor in the sight of glorified
   saints in Heaven, depend upon it, He is not hard to be persuaded!
   Christ is quite as willing to save as ever the most longing sinner can
   be to be saved! It is His delight to give of His liberality, to
   dispense of His bounty to those who need! Have hope then. The generous
   Character of Christ should encourage you!

   Have hope, I say, once more, because of what Christ endured upon the
   Cross. See Him dying in unutterable pains and pangs! See His hands and
   feet distilling founts of blood! See His body racked with agonies that
   cannot be described! His soul, meanwhile, ground and crushed beneath
   the wheels of Divine Wrath against the sin He bore for our sakes! His
   whole Being is a mass of suffering in our place! Now, why all this
   miraculous and sacrificial endurance? Surely that bearing all this, we
   might be spared and never know its anguish! Oh, when my soul looks to
   Christ, it seems to see that nothing is impossible with such an
   Atonement! No sin is too black for that blood to wash and cleanse away!
   It cannot be that beneath Heaven there can be a sinner so abominable
   that the blood of Christ cannot make a full atonement for all his sins!
   Come, then! Come, then--'tis the voice of Jesus that calls you! Come,
   you chief of sinners! Come now, before yet another sun shall dawn! Come
   and find in Jesus' wounds a refuge from the stormy blast that shall
   soon come to sweep the unconverted into condemnation!

   Yet must we still pass on and, only for a moment, linger upon--

   IV. THE COMFORT WHICH THE TEXT AFFORDS TO THOSE WHO HAVE A HOPE IN
   GOD'S MERCY.

   It says that the eye of the Lord is upon them. There is a blessing for
   you. Nobody else's eye is upon you. You have got up to London, away
   from parents and friends, and nobody looks after you now. You have come
   into this big Tabernacle and I am sorry to find that there are still
   some of our members who do not look after strangers--do not look after
   souls as they ought to do--and you have been coming here and nobody has
   spoken to you. Now, let me read the text, and I need not say any more,
   " The eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him, upon those who hope
   in His mercy." God sees you and you do not need anybody else! Be
   content that God knows all about it. You are up in the top gallery
   there, somewhere behind where my eye cannot reach you--and hardly my
   voice--but "the eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him, upon those
   who hope in His mercy." And mark that eye, as well as being an eye of
   observation, is also an eye of pity! God has compassion on you! He
   stands side by side with you--that bleeding Son of God--and in your
   groans He groans, and in your griefs He takes a share. He has
   compassion on you--yes, and He will help you--and even now He loves
   you. The eye with which He looks upon you is a Father's eye and when a
   father sees his child broken-hearted, he says to himself, "I can stand
   anything but this. My child's tears overcome me, overmaster me. I
   cannot see him sick and sad and sobbing, without pitying him."

   Oh, some of you have sons and daughters of your own! And when you see
   that sick child of yours crying with pain, why, you would spend all you
   have, if you could but get some doctor that would make him well
   again."Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them
   that fear Him." And that means all those who hope in His mercy, for
   they are put, as I told you, in the text in the same category as those
   who fear Him. Your Father's eye is upon you and He pities those tears,
   sighs and cries of yours--He loves you and He means to bless you!

   Now, I want to say to you Believers here, something similar to what I
   said at this morning's service. I wish that all the members of this
   Church were more on the alert after those who are beginning to hope in
   God's mercy. Some are. I cannot find much fault with you. You are my
   joy and crown--and sometimes I boast--I hope in no wrong way, of
   theearnestness of many in this Church! But make me not ashamed of this,
   my boasting, as some might well do, who are cold and careless about the
   souls of men. Do you know there are lost ones round about you, lost
   ones about whom you seem to have no concern, though, according to
   Christ's Law, they are your brethren, your neighbors? What a sad, sad
   story it is that we have lately been seeing in the newspapers every
   day--a gentleman lost, rewards offered, the police searching-- but he
   is lost! A hat found. Some sort of clue given. But he is lost! How must
   the parent hearts break! How must friends, day by day, feel life a
   burden till they know what has become of him! He is lost! He is lost!
   Ah, but the loss of a man for this life, though it is a very heavy
   blow, is nothing compared with the loss of a soul! Ah, Mother, you have
   got a child who is lost. Ah, Husband, you have got a wife who is lost!
   Ah, Wife, your husband is lost! And have you never advertised for him?
   Have you never sought him? God knows where he is! Have you never gone
   to God and said, "Seek him and find him"? Have you never enlisted the
   Great Soul-Finder's aid, who came into the world, "to seek and to save
   that which was lost"?

   Are you quite careless about it, whether your servants, your neighbors,
   your husbands, your wives, your children shall be lost forever or not?
   Then am I ashamed of you! And angels are ashamed of you! And God's
   living people are ashamed of you! And Christ Himself may well be
   ashamed of you, that you have no care for those whom you ought to love!

   I do trust that this is not the case with us, but that we do anxiously
   desire that lost ones should be saved. Come, then, I want you to look
   up those who are beginning to seek Christ! And when you have done that,
   and have found them out, then I want you to seek after those who are
   notseeking Christ. I do not think there ought to be a person come
   within these four walls, into these galleries, or on the area, but
   shall be attacked, for his good, by someone or other, before the whole
   assembly is scattered! Surely you might find a way of putting some
   question, kindly and affectionately--not rudely--but respectfully, so
   that if I have been the means in any way of making a little impression
   on their souls, you may follow it up by personal dealing! If I have put
   in the nail of the Truth of God a little way, you may give it a heavy
   blow and drive it in deeper--and God grant that the Holy Spirit may
   clinch the nail so that it may never be drawn out!

   Oh, my Hearers, we must have you saved! We cannot go on much longer
   with some of you as you are because you yourselves will not go on much
   longer as you are! We have been rather free for the last few weeks from
   deaths and departures, but do not think that we shall be free from them
   long! In the ordinary course of nature, as those who calculate the
   averages of human life will tell you, a certain proportion of a great
   multitude like this--some 6,000 and more--must soon die. There is no
   chance about whether we shall or not--we must. Now, who shall it be?
   Who shall stand before his God? To whose ears will the ringing trumpet
   of the archangel sound? For whom shall the funeral bell be tolled? Over
   whom shall it be said, "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust"? Since we know
   not to whom the summons may come, may this be the command to all,
   "Consider your ways and prepare to meet your God." Oh, that you might
   prepare this very night, and seek unto the Lord with full purpose of
   heart! And this is the promise, "He that seeks, finds; he that asks,
   receives and to him that knocks, it shall be opened."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM139.

   This is a Psalm we can never read too often. It will be to us one of
   the greatest safeguards against sin if we have its teaching constantly
   before our mind's eyes. The teaching of this Psalm is simply this,
   "You, God, see me."

   Verse 1. O Lord, You have searched me, and known me. You have looked
   into my most secret part. The most intricate labyrinths of my spirit
   are all observed by You. You have not searched and yet been unable to
   discover the secret of my nature, but You have searched me and known
   me. Your search has been an efficient one. You have read the secrets of
   my soul.

   2. You know my sitting down andmy rising up, You understand my thoughts
   afar of. It is a common enough thing to sit down and to rise up and I,
   myself, oftentimes scarcely know why I do the one or the other, but You
   know and understand all. "You understand my thoughts afar off." My
   heart forms a thought that never comes to a word or an act, but You not
   only perceive it, but You translate it! You understand my thoughts.

   3. You compass my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all
   my ways. I am surrounded by You as by a ring of observers.

   4. For there is not a word on my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it
   altogether. Not only the words on my tongue, but those that slumber in
   my tongue, the unspoken words, You know them perfectly and altogether!

   5. You have beset me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon mm.
   Your Presence amounts to actual contact. You not only see, but touch,
   like the physician who does not merely look at the wound, but by-and-by
   comes to probe it. So do You probe my wounds and see the deeps of my
   sins.

   6. 7. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me! It is high, I cannot
   attain unto it. Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I
   flee from Your Presence? It seems as if the first impulse was to fly
   away from a God whose attributes were so lofty. 'Twas but a transient
   impression, yet David words it so.

   8, 10. If I ascend up into Heaven, You are there: if I make my bed in
   Hell, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the morning and
   dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Your hand
   lead me, and Your right hand shall hold m. How swift he supposes his
   flight to be, as swift as the light, for he borrows the wings of the
   morning--and yet the hand of God was controlling his destiny even then!
   As Watts rhymes it--

   "If mounted on the morning ray, I fly beyond the western sea, Your
   swifter hand should first arrive, And there arrest Your fugitive." 11,
   12. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall
   be light about me. Yes, the darkness hides not from You, but the night
   shines as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to You.
   For, mystery of mysteries, and more wondrous still, You not only
   observe, but You always have observed! And You have not only observed
   my well-formed being and my visible life, but before I had a being, You
   did observe what I should be, and when I was yet in embryo, Your
   all-observing eyes watched me.

   13-16. For You have possessed my reins: You have covered me in my
   mother's womb. I will praise You; for I am fearfully and wonderfully
   made: marvelous are Your works: and that my soul knows right well My
   substance was not hid from You when I was made in secret and curiously
   worked in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes did see my
   substance, yet being not perfect, and in Your Book all my members were
   written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was
   none of them.In so vivid a manner does our holy poet sing of the
   Omniscience of God with regard to our creation. Before we had breath He
   formed and fashioned us.

   17. How precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is
   the sum of them!How many thoughts has God towards us! We cannot count
   them! And how kind are those thoughts--we cannot estimate them--how
   precious, how great!

   18. IfIshould count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I
   awake, I am still with You. I suppose I had finished the tale, had
   counted up all Your thoughts to me and then fell asleep. I should then
   but begin to count again, for You continue to thrust out mercies from
   Your hands. My God, my numeration shall never overtake You, much less
   my gratitude, and the service that is Your due!

   19. Surely You will slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, therefore,
   you bloody men. "Surely"--here is a solemn inference from the
   Omniscience of God--"surely You will slay the wicked, O God." You have
   seen their wickedness. They have committed their wickedness in Your
   Presence. You will need no witnesses, no jury! You are all in one! Are
   You not the Judge of all the earth, and shall You not do right? "Surely
   You will destroy the wicked, O God." Then I desire not to have those in
   my company who are condemned criminals and are soon to be executed.
   "Depart from me, therefore, you bloody men." See how this sets David
   upon purging his company and keeping himself clean in his associations,
   since God, who sees all, and will surely punish, would hold it to be
   evil on the part of His servant to be found associating with rebellious
   men?

   20-22. For they speak against You wickedly, and Your enemies take Your
   name in vain. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate You? And am not I
   grieved with those that rise up against You? I hate them with perfect
   hatred: I count them my enemies. We are bound to love our own enemies,
   but not God's enemies, since they are haters of all that isgood and all
   that is true--and the essentially Good One, Himself. We love them as
   our fellow beings, but we hate them as haters of God.

   23, 24. Search me, O God, andknow my heart: try me, and knnowmy
   thoughts. Andsee if there are any wicked ways in me, and lead me in the
   way everlasting.

Preparation for the Lord's Supper

   (No. 3391)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink
   ofthat cup." 1 Corinthians 11:28.

   "Let a man examine himself." That is, any man--every man who intends to
   eat of that bread and drink of that cup. The word is indefinite that it
   may be understood to be universal. No man is to come to that Table, no
   woman is to draw near without the previous self-examination. No age
   will excuse us, for there have been aged hypocrites, as well as young
   deceivers. No office will exonerate us from this examination, for there
   was a Judas even among the Apostles. The highest degree in the Church
   of God may consist with the most rotten formality. We are to examine
   ourselves each time we come. Each man is to do so. No one is to shirk
   the personal duty. Everyone is to undertake it as in the sight of God.
   Brothers and Sisters, you members of the Church about to come around
   this Table, give heed to the mandate of the Holy Spirit, by the
   inspired Apostle! "Let each one here examine himself, and so let him
   eat of this bread."

   "Let a man examine himself." The word is forcible. Let him make
   inquisition into his own soul as to whether all is right or not. Let
   him search diligently, tracing out every symptom that looks
   unfavorable, if, perhaps, that symptom may reveal the truth. Let him
   dwell upon every dark side or ill-looking spot, if, perhaps, those dark
   signs should mean more than is apparent on the surface. We are not to
   trifle with ourselves by making a superficial survey. Let a man examine
   himself as does the dealer in precious metals when he thrusts the ore
   into the fire, knowing that only the gold will come out, while the
   dross will be consumed. Put yourself into a crucible! Heat the furnace
   of examination seven times hotter than before, for since your heart
   will, if possible, escape from knowing the truth, be resolved that it
   shall know it, and the worst of it, too! Let a man review, test, prove,
   search, try! In all the strongest words that I could find that mean the
   fullest scrutiny, would I put the language of the Apostle, "Let a man
   examine himself."

   "Let a man examine himself" He need not be so particular to examine
   those that surround him. If there should be unworthy communicants at
   the Table, his communing will not thereby be damaged. Though some may
   have intruded where they ought not to be, yet if your heart and mind
   shall come near to Christ in actual fellowship, we shall not have the
   less indulgence from our Lord because a Judas happened to be there.
   "Let a man examine himself." Let it be personal work. I know there is
   an examination through which the Church member among us passes, when
   such as are experienced in the faith ask, "What do you know of these
   things? What is your faith touching this and that? Have you believed?
   Have you repented?" Such an examination, however, must never content
   you. I pray you never feel that it is any certificate of genuine
   discipleship to have been seen by the Elders, or to have had the pastor
   satisfied of your conversion. We are poor, fallible creatures--we
   cannot profess to search the heart--no, we never did profess it! It is
   but your outward life and your profession that we are called upon to
   judge at all. You must not go by our examination, but, "Let a man
   examine himself." You are to look into your own heart, with your own
   eyes and ask to have them enlightened by the Holy Spirit! You are to
   hold the balance, yourselves, and weigh your soul therein. You are not
   to be satisfied with a second-hand judgment, or with another man's
   search! Take the candle yourself, Man! Go through every corner and
   every crevice. Sweep out the old leaven and so keep the feast in
   simplicity of heart. "Let a man examine himself."

   '"Andso," says the Apostle, "let him eat of that bread." That is to
   say, the examination is to be seasonable. It is to come always at the
   time of the eating of the bread and the drinking of the wine. It should
   always be the prelude to communion. Examination should preface
   enjoyment. You should see whether you ought to be there and have a
   right to be there and, that ascertained, then you should come--but not
   till then! Is it not a very significant circumstance that the very
   first time our Lord took the bread and broke it, and instituted this
   Supper, there was at that very time a selfexamination going on--and
   they then made an appeal to the Lord, Himself, at the conclusion, for
   each one said, when the question was asked as to who it was that would
   betray Him, "Lord, is it I?" "Lord, is it I?"--not at all an unsuitable
   question to be passed round tonight, when we shall break bread, and
   hear it said, "One of you will betray Me." Ah, Brothers and Sisters, I
   fear there are many more than one here among professors who will betray
   Him! Perhaps there are scores, if not hundreds, among so large a mass
   of professing Christians who will not prove, after all, to be genuine!
   Then let the question, though it stirs the anguish of your souls, pass
   round among you, "Lord, is it I?" "Lord, is it I?" Nor let any man eat
   of this bread, or drink of this cup till he has humbly in his soul
   sought to put it to his conscience, that he may investigate this matter
   whether he is Christ's or not!

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, for a few minutes we shall look at the
   matter about which we are to examine ourselves. And then we shall press
   upon you this examination, by giving you a few reasons for it May God
   grant us a blessing in this searching business!

   I. CONCERNING WHAT WE ARE TO EXAMINE.

   You will observe that the text does not tell us, "Let a man examine
   himself as to this or that particular, and so let him eat." He is to
   examine himself, but the Apostle does not say about what. The inference
   is that he is to examine himself about this Supper. He is to examine
   himself as to whether he has a right to eat of this bread and to drink
   of this wine. The Supper gives us the clue, then, as to what we are to
   examine ourselves upon. I shall see before me, presently, broken bread
   and the wine cup filled with the red wine. These two things are the
   emblems--the bread of the body of Christ, which was bruised and made to
   suffer for our sake--the wine of that precious blood of Christ by which
   sin is pardoned and souls are redeemed.

   I have no right to touch these emblems unless in my soul I believe the
   facts that they represent Shall I not begin to question myself, then?
   Do I accept, as a certain fact that the Word was made flesh and dwelt
   among us? Do I believe that God descended from the highest Throne of
   Glory and became a Man born of woman? Do I believe that He suffered in
   human flesh, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God? Do I believe
   that in His blood, which was "shed for many," there is a virtue for the
   putting away of sin and making Atonement to Almighty God, and that so
   sinners may be accepted in the Beloved? Unless I believe these things,
   I am clearly a hypocrite, a terrible hypocrite, if I dare to come to
   this Table at all! I am perverse among the perverse to thrust myself in
   to touch the emblems when I do not accept the facts which those emblems
   set forth! Now, every man here can easily examine himself by that test,
   but I hope the most of us here would say, "We do believe those facts."
   Yes, but do you believe them as facts that are forcible in themselves
   and fraught with consequences? Do you apprehend them in their amazing
   weight and their stupendous bearing upon the judgment of God and the
   destiny of men? God made flesh--God Incarnate--Jesus, Immanuel,
   suffering to put away the sins of His people--The Christ of God
   presenting salvation to every soul that trusts in Him! Why, this is
   news such as never stirred even Paradise, itself, before! It is the
   best, highest and most wondrous news that angels ever heard! We ought
   to so hear and accept these facts in that same spirit that
   characterized them when they transpired, in order to duly discern their
   importance, or we have no right to come here!

   Furthermore, Brothers and Sisters. Every man who eats of the bread and
   drinks of the wine sets forth in emblem by the eating of the bread that
   the flesh of Christ is his, and by the drinking of the wine that the
   blood of Christ is his. Because he has possession of these things, he,
   therefore, comes to eat as men eat their own bread, or to drink as men
   drink their own wine. Now, dear Hearer, the question asked of you is
   this--Have you an interest in the body and the blood of Christ? "How
   can I know my interest therein?" asks one. You may know it thus--Do you
   fully and alone rely upon Jesus Christ for your salvation? Do you
   implicitly trust the merits of His agonies? Do you, without any other
   confidence, cast yourself fully upon the great atoning Sacrifice and
   transactions of Calvary? If so, that faith gives you Christ! It is the
   evidence that Christ is yours--you need not be afraid to come and take
   the wine when you so manifestly have the thing that is signified
   thereby. You may come--you are invited to come--you cannot stay away
   without sin if Christ, indeed, is yours!

   The question may assume another form. This Supper was instituted that
   we might remember Christ in it. A question, then, for each one--Can you
   remember Christ? Will coming here help you to remember Jesus Christ? If
   not, you must not come. How can you remember what you do not know? And
   how shall you remember at all aright, One in whom you have no part nor
   lot? To remember Christ as a mere person in history is of no more use
   than to remember Julius Cesar, or

   Napoleon Bonaparte! To remember Christ, who loved you and gave Himself
   for you--this is the choice remembrance that will be beneficial to your
   spirits. Beloved, I am quite certain that sometimes in what is called,
   "the Sacrament," there is little or no recollection of Christ. Men and
   women come to it with no idea of remembering Him. They think that there
   is something in the thing, itself--some holiness in eating the bread
   and drinking the wine--some Grace bestowed by the priestly hands that
   administer the emblems of the Passion. But oh, it is not so! This is
   not to receive the Lord's Supper--this is but Popish idolatry! This is
   not the true worship of the child of God! You come to the Table to
   remember Him! And only as far as those signs help you to remember
   Him--to trust Him, to love Him--only so far do they become a means of
   Grace to you! There is no latent moral virtue in material substances!
   No regeneration lurks in water! No confirmation in Grace streams from
   prelatic hands! There is no sanctity in lawn sleeves! There is no
   holiness in bread and nothing devout in wine! These are just outward
   and visible signs. The holiness, the sanctity, the Grace must lie in
   your own hearts as you lovingly receive these symbols and draw near
   with true spirits to the Lord who bought you with His blood! Ask
   yourselves, then--do you remember Him? Would these things help you to
   remember Him? If not, you have no business here.

   It may be that some child of God here tonight is not fit to come to the
   Table. You may be startled, perhaps, at that remark, but I venture to
   suppose such a thing possible! And if it should happen to turn out to
   be the case, I pray that Brother or Sister to take the admonition home!
   Is there any Brother whom you have offended, whose forgiveness you have
   not sought, or is there anyone who has offended you, to whom you have
   not rendered forgiveness? I think that what our Lord said about coming
   to the altar and leaving the gift before the altar until first we have
   been reconciled to our brother--though this is no altar at all--may be
   with all righteousness supposed concerning this Table! How can you
   expect fellowship with Christ with an unforgiving heart? How can you
   love God, whom you have not seen, if you do not love your brother, whom
   you have seen? If it is so hard for you to forgive, how hard will it be
   for you to be forgiven? An unforgiving spirit shuts you out of Heaven.
   Why, Man, you cannot even perform the lowliest act--you cannot pray!
   You, cannot say, "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
   trespass against us." And if you cannot pray, much less can you
   commune! Oh, see to that, and let each man and woman examine themselves
   upon that!

   In pressing this subject upon you, may I be permitted to say, very
   earnestly, that the right way to examine ourselves before coming to
   this Table is by the rule which is laid down in Scripture. Examine
   yourselves by the tests and proofs of the Spirit which are spoken of in
   God's Word. Just as you would examine another, impartially--

   "Nothing extenuate, Nor anything set down in malice"-- so must you
   examine yourselves. Alas, we have one rule for others and another rule
   for ourselves! How mistakenly quick-sighted are we to discover the
   imperfections and infirmities of others of God's people, while our own
   glaring sins scarcely give our conscience a twinge! We go about with
   great beams in our eyes, all the while wondering why our Brothers and
   Sisters cannot see the mote that is in theirs! Judge yourselves! Judge
   yourselves and let the severity of your judgment upon your fellow
   Christians be now turned upon yourselves! It will be much more to your
   profit and much more according to the rules of Christian charity. God
   grant we may, none of us, be afraid of the strictest rules of Scripture
   in their sternest form. Alas, Brothers and Sisters, we often stop short
   in our self-examinations just when they might be of use to us, like the
   patient who tears off the plaster just when it begins to work, or
   ceases to receive the medicine precisely when it has reached a point in
   which it would be useful! Press home, press home, the grave questions
   and anxieties that lurk within you! Never be afraid to be probed to the
   quick and to be cut to the core. Make no provision for self-deception!
   Ask the Lord to lay bare your hearts, right bare, before His Omniscient
   eyes. And as you are thus examining, do not flinch, do not mince
   matters, do not trifle, do not be partial, but judge yourselves truly
   and thoroughly, lest, after all, you should be mistaken! And lest,
   after coming to this Table, you should be banished from the Marriage
   Supper of the Lamb!

   Thus much upon the points which are in debate--about which we are to
   examine our fitness to come to this Table. Allow me now, as best I
   can--

   II. TO PRESS THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT UPON YOU, WITH SOME REASONS
   WHY THERE

   SHOULD BE SUCH A SELF-EXAMINATION.

   I might say, Brothers and Sisters, that such an examination should be
   used because self-knowledge is always valuable. The old Greeks, whose
   wonderful sayings often verged upon Inspiration, used to say, "Man,
   know yourself!" It is ill for a man to be acquainted with foreign
   countries and to know nothing of his own--to understand other men's
   farms and to let his own run to waste--to be conversant with other
   men's health and to be dying of a secret disease! To study other men's
   characters, but to allow his own character to be obnoxious in the sight
   of God. Know yourselves! Nothing will pay you better than to search
   your own hearts and to know yourselves. Of all stock-taking, this is
   one of the most beneficial. It will often be the death of pride when a
   man finds out what he really is. Self-righteousness will fly before
   such a searching, as owls fly before the rising sun! Know yourself and
   you are on the road to knowing Christ, for the knowledge of self will
   humble you, will make you feel your need of Jesus and may, in the hands
   of God the Holy Spirit, lead you to the finding of the Savior! Oh, Men
   and Women, how is it that you have so many acquaintances, such a large
   circle of friends and yet do not make acquaintance with yourselves?
   While you will read much of literature, you read not your own hearts!
   You commune with others, yet you commune not with yourselves and do not
   know yourselves. I pray you examine yourselves, if for no other reason
   than because such lore is among the most precious that a man can gain!

   Examine yourselves, again, you professed Christians, because it is a
   marvelously easy thing for us to be deceived and to continue to be
   deceived. Of course, every man likes to be flattered. Whether he
   believes it is so or not, this is a universal truth, and any man--I
   care not who he may be--is very easily to be persuaded that all is
   right with him. Satan, too, will help your natural tendencies, your
   partiality to yourselves. He only wishes to lull you to sleep and to
   rock you in the cradle of delusion. All things around a man conspire to
   help him to delude himself. The notion of Grace which is commonly
   entertained, the popularity of religion, the ease with which a man can
   join a church, the littleness of persecution in these days--all these
   things help to make it a very easy passage by which a man may glide
   along, until even when he dies he may still believe that he is on the
   road to Heaven, while all the while he has been going post-haste to
   Hell! Oh, since it is so easy to be deceived, and it is your soul that
   is in jeopardy, I beseech you examine yourselves!

   Besides, my dear Friends, you know how some are deceived. Charge your
   memories a minute. Do you not know some among your own acquaintance
   that are deceived? Ah, you readily remember them! But do you know that
   there were persons sitting in other parts of the Tabernacle who were
   thinking ofyouwhile you were thinking of them! You said of such a one,
   "Ah, I have watched her at home. I know that noisy tongue of hers, she
   is no Christian." And that very woman was just whispering to herself,
   "Ah, I know him. I have traded at his shop. I know those short weights
   of his--he is no Christian." Ah, you do not want God to condemn you--if
   you were only allowed to speak, you would condemn yourselves! But if
   such is the case, that we so readily can find out that others are
   deceived, is not the question one that is worth the asking, "May we not
   be deceived, ourselves?" Oh, let it come home. May not the preacher be
   deceived? May not Elders and deacons, who have been in honor these many
   years, be, nevertheless, rotten at heart? May not members of this
   Church who have been at this Table from the very beginning, almost from
   their childhood have, after all, had but a superficial godliness that
   will not stand the fire, that shall try every man's work, of what sort
   it is? Therefore, I beseech you, since many are deceived, examine
   yourselves and so come to this Table.

   Further, remember that it is important for professing Christians to do
   this, beyond all others, because, perhaps, there is no greater bar to
   the reception of Grace in all this world than the belief that you have
   Grace already. It were a mercy if some here present had never joined
   the Church. Sad that I should say it, but it is so. It were a mercy to
   themselves that they had never professed to be Christians, because now,
   if we preach repentance, they say, "I repented years ago." If we talk
   of faith in the Savior, they say, "I have faith--I joined the Church
   and avowed my faith." If we speak of Christian knowledge--they have
   Christian knowledge--though it is the knowledge that puffs up. They
   have the imitation of all the Graces and, as it is sometimes very
   difficult to know which is the real gem and which is the paste gem that
   imitates it, so these people live so much like Christians, in many
   respects, that it is hard even for themselves to discover that they are
   not rich and increased in goods, but are naked, and poor, and
   miserable! If I were out of Christ, I would wish to be out of the
   Church. If I had no faith in Him, would that I had no profession of
   Him! If there is any soul in any place that is least likely to be
   saved, it is an unregenerate soul inside the Church, participating in
   Christian ordinances and dead while it lives! Search yourselves, then
   on this account.

   And let me add another solemn word. Search yourselves because within a
   short time, at the very longest, you wiil be upon the bed of death and
   there, if not before, there wiil be deep searching of heart. When the
   outward man decays andthe flesh is melting away, you will need
   something more than profession to lean on. Sacraments, and going to
   places of worship will prove but poor things to bear you up in the
   midst of the billows of death! How must a man feel when he puts out on
   that dread sea with his lifebelt and finds it will not bear his weight!
   When he leaps into his lifeboat that he had hoped would bear him safely
   to the haven, and finds that every timber is strained and that it
   leaks--and he sinks into the flood. Oh, find out your mistakes while
   yet there is time to rectify them! I beseech you by the living God,
   whose face of fire you shall soon see, prepare yourselves for His
   judgment as well as for the judgment of your own conscience in the hour
   of death, for every man must be weighed in the balance! No mere
   pretender shall pass the gates of bliss. Destitute of faith, it matters
   not how bright your profession--you shall be banished from His
   Presence! If it is not Grace-work and heart-work, you may have eaten or
   drunk in His Presence and He may have taught in your streets, but He
   will never know you! If you have never confessed your sins in secret to
   the great High Priest. If you have never laid your hand upon that
   precious head that bore the sin of His elect. If you have never seen in
   solemn transfer your iniquities passed over to Him--and if your faith
   has never recognized that transaction and rejoiced in it--oh, beware,
   beware, beware, for in the last tremendous day your professions shall
   be but a painted pageantry for you to go to Hell in! Yes, worse than
   that, among the firewood of your burning that shall flash most
   furiously with devouring fire, will be the hollow sticks of your base
   profession, your bastard godliness, your counterfeit graces, your
   glitter that was not golden, your profession that was not based upon
   possession!

   Oh, dear Brothers and Sisters, for these reasons let a man examine
   himself, and so let him eat of this bread.

   But now, supposing this to be all done and we have come to this answer,
   "I am not in Christ. I am not a Christian. I have not believed"? Then,
   away, away, away from this Table! But where shall I send you? I will
   send you to the Cross. Though you may not come to the Table, you may
   come to Jesus!

   But suppose your answer should be, "I am very unworthy and sinful, but
   still, I have believed in Jesus, though I yet see much in myself that
   is evil." Dear Brothers and Sisters, that is not the question!
   Preparation for the Lord's Supper does not lie in perfect
   sanctification, but in true faith in Jesus! If, then, you have made
   sure of this, have done with the examination--I mean for
   tonight--because after you have examined yourself, it does not then
   say, "Keep on," but, "So let him eat," and I do not like that
   examination to stick in the throat so that you cannot digest the dainty
   morsels of the Savior's precious body. It is done! You have examined
   and you know Him! You have believed in Him and trusted that He is able
   to keep you. Now, then, take care that you eat! I mean not merely eat
   with the mouth and drink with the throat, but now take care to pray
   that you may have real fellowship with the Incarnate God, gratefully
   magnifying the Grace that has made you to differ and cheerfully
   accepting the precious Person who is the ground of your reliance, of
   the life of your soul!

   God grant you now, having passed the door and shown your entrance
   ticket as true Christians, to sit and eat bread in the Kingdom of God!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 6:1-24; 1 CORINTHIANS 3:1-16.

   Verse 1. Take heed that you do not do your alms before men, to be seen
   of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in
   Heavei.. The motive which leads a man to give will form the true
   estimate of what he does. If he gives to be seen of men, then when he
   is seen of men he has the reward he sought for--and he will never have
   any other. Let us never do our alms or good works before men, to be
   seen of them.

   2-5. Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before
   you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
   they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
   reward. But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your
   right hand does, that your alms may be in secret: and your Father which
   sees in secret, shall Himself reward you openly. And when you pray, you
   shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in
   the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
   of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward I have heard very
   great commendation given to certain Easterns, because at the hour of
   the rising of the sun, or the hour when the sound is heard from the
   summit of the mosque, wherever they may be, they put themselves in the
   posture of prayer. God forbid I should rob them of any credit they
   deserve, but far be it from us ever to imitate them! We are not to be
   ashamed of our prayers, but they are not things for the public street!
   They are intended for God's eyes and God's ears, only.

   6, 7. But you, when you pray, enter into your closet and when you have
   shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your
   Father, which sees in secret, shall reward you openly. But when you
   pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think they
   shall be heard for their much speaking. It is not very easy to repeat
   the same words often without it becoming a vain repetition. A
   repetition, however, is not forbidden, but a "vain" repetition. And how
   greatly do they err who measure prayers by the yard! They think they
   have prayed so much because they have prayed so long, whereas it is the
   work of the heart--the true pouring out of the desire before God--that
   is the thing to be looked at. Quality not quantity! Truth, not length.
   Oftentimes the shortest prayers have the most prayer in them.

   8, 9. Be not you, therefore, like they: for your Father knows what
   things you have need of before you ask Him. After this manner therefore
   pray you.And then He gives us a model of prayer which never can be
   excelled--containing all the parts of devotion. They do well who model
   their prayers upon this.

   9-13 OurFather which are in Heaven, Hallowedbe Yourname. Yourkingdom
   come. Your willbe done in earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
   our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
   And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil For Yours is
   the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen. Our Savior
   now makes a remark upon this prayer and on one particular part of it
   which has stumbled a great many.

   14, 15. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
   will also forgive you. But if you forgive not men their trespasses,
   neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. There are some who
   have altered this and pray in this fashion, "Forgive us our debts as we
   desire to forgive our debtors." It will not do! You will have to desire
   God to forgive you, and desire in vain if you pray in that fashion! It
   must come to this point of literal, immediate, completed forgiveness of
   every offense committed against you if you expect God to forgive you.
   There is no wriggling out of it. The man who refuses to forgive,
   refuses to be forgiven! God grant that we may, none of us, tolerate
   malice in our hearts. Anger glances in the bosom of wise men--it only
   burns in the heart of the foolish. May we quench it and feel that we do
   freely, fully and heartily forgive, knowing that we are forgiven!

   16. Moreover when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad
   countenance: for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto
   men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.Simpletons
   praise them--think much of them--and they plume themselves thereon and
   think themselves the very best of men. They have their reward.

   17, 18. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
   that you appear not unto men to fast, but unto your Father which is in
   secret, and your Father, which sees in secret, shall reward you openly.
   Yet have I heard persons speak of certain emaciated ecclesiastics as
   being such wonderfully holy men. "How they must have fasted! They look
   like it. You can see it in their faces." Probably much more likely
   produced by a fault in their digestion, than by anything else! And if
   not--if we are to suppose that the skinniness of a man, his person, is
   to be the token of his holiness--then the living skeleton was a saint
   to perfection! But we are not beguiled by such follies as these. The
   Christian fasts but he takes care that no one shall know it. He wears
   no ring or token even when his heart is heavy. Full often he puts on a
   cheerful air, lest by any means he should communicate unnecessary
   sorrow to others! And he will be cheerful and happy in the midst of
   company, to prevent their being sad, for it is enough for him to be
   sad, himself, and sad before his Father's face.

   19-21. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
   rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal But lay up for
   yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupt,
   and where thieves do not break through nor steal For where your
   treasure is, there will your heart be also. There is many a way of
   sending your treasure before you to Heaven. God's poor are His
   money-boxes--His bankers. You can pass your treasure over to Heaven by
   their means. And the work of evangelizing the world by the labors of
   God's servants in the ministry of the Gospel--you can help this, also.
   There is much need for your plenty. Thus also you can pass your
   treasure over into the King's bank and your heart will follow it! I
   have heard of one who said his religion did not cost him a shilling a
   year-- and it was remarked that very probably it would have been
   expensive at the price. You will find people form a pretty accurate
   estimate of the value of their own religion by the proportion which
   they are prepared to sacrifice for it.

   22. The light of the body is the eye. If, therefore, your eye is
   single. If your motive is single--if you have only one motive--and that
   a right one--the master one of glorifying God--if your eye is single.

   22, 23. Your whole body shall be full of light. But if your eye is
   evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the
   light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness/When a
   man's highest motive is himself, what a dark and selfish nature he has!
   But when his highest motive is his God, what brightness of light will
   shine upon all.

   24. No man can serve two masters. He can serve two persons very
   readily. For that matter, he can serve twenty, but not two masters.
   There cannot be two master principles in a man's heart, or master
   passions in a man's soul. "No man can serve two masters."

   24. For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he
   will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and
   mammoi.. Though some men's lives are a long experiment of how far they
   can serve the two.

   1 CORINTHIANS 3:1-16

   Verse 1. AndI, brethren, couldnot speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
   as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ The Church at Corinth
   consisted of persons of large education and great abilities. It was one
   of those churches that had given up the one-man system, where everybody
   talked as he liked--a very knowing Church, and a Church of Christians,
   too. But for all that, Christian babies! And though they thought
   themselves to be so great, yet the Apostle says that he never spoke to
   them as to spiritual men--he kept to the simple elements--regarding the
   carnal part as being too much in them as yet to be able to drink down
   spiritual things.

   2. Ihave fed you with milk, andnot with meat: for up to nowyou were not
   able to bear it, neither yet now are you abl. How grateful we ought to
   be that there is milk and that this milk does feed the soul--that the
   simplest Truths of Christianity contain in them all that the soul
   needs--just as milk is a diet upon which the body could be sustained
   without anything else. Yet how we ought to desire to grow that we may
   not always be upon a milk diet but that we may be able to digest the
   strong meat--the high Doctrine of the deep things of God. These are for
   men, not for babes. Let the babes be thankful for the milk, but let us
   aspire to be strong men that we may feed on meat.

   3. For you are yet carnal: for where as there is among you envying, and
   strife, and divisions, are you not carnal and walk as men? A united
   Church, you may conclude, is a growing Church--perhaps a grown Church!
   But a disunited Church, split up into factions where every man is
   seeking position and trying to be noted--such a Church is a Church of
   babes. They are carnal and walk as men.

   4. For while one says, I am of Paul: and another, I am of Apollos, are
   you not carnalllnstead of that, they should all have striven together
   for the defense of the common faith of Jesus Christ. No greater symptom
   of mere infancy in true religion than the setting up of the names of
   leaders or the preference for this or that peculiar form of Doctrine,
   instead of endeavoring to grasp the whole of the Truth of God wherever
   one can find it.

   5. 6. Who, then, is Paul? And who is Apollos but ministers by whom you
   believed, even as the Lordgave to every man? I have planted, Apollos
   watered: but God gave the increase. Let God, then, have all the glory!
   Be grateful for the planter and grateful for the waterer, yes, and
   grateful to them as well. But still, let the stress of your gratitude
   be given to Him without whom watering and planting would be in vain!

   7, 8. So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that
   waters, but God that gives the increase. Now he that plants and he that
   waters are one.They are pursuing the same design! And Apollos and Paul
   were one in heart. They were true servants of one Master.

   8, 9. And every man shall receive his own reward according to his own
   labor. For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry,
   you are God's building. The Church is built up. God is He who builds it
   up--the Master of the work, but He employs His ministers under Him to
   be builders.

   10-13. According to the Grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
   master builder, Ihave laid the foundation, and another builds thereon.
   But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon. For other
   foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ. Now
   if any man builds upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones,
   wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest. For the
   day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
   shall try every mans work, of what sort it isIt is very easy to build
   up a Church quickly. It is very easy to make a great excitement in
   religion and become very famous as a soul-winner. Very easy. But time
   tries everything! If there were no other fire than the mere fire of
   time, it would suffice to test a man's work. And when a church crumbles
   away almost as soon as it is got together--when a church declines from
   the Doctrines which it professed to hold, when the teaching of the
   eminent teacher is proved, after all, to have been fallacious and to
   have been erroneous in practical results, then what he has built comes
   to nothing! Oh, dear Friends, what little we do, we ought to aspire to
   do for eternity. If you shall never lay the brush to the canvas but
   once, make an indelible stroke with it! If only one work of sort shall
   come from the statuary's workshop, let it be something that will live
   all down the ages! But we are in such a mighty hurry--we make a lot of
   things that die with us--transient results. We are not careful enough
   as to what we build with. May God grant that this truth may sink into
   our minds! Let us remember that if it is hard building with gold and
   silver, and harder still building with precious stones, yet what is
   built will stand the fire! It is easy building with wood--and still
   easier with hay and stubble--but then there will be only a handful of
   ashes left of a whole lifework if we build with these.

   14-15. If any man's work abides which he has built thereupon, he shall
   receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
   loss, but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. If he meant
   right--if he endeavored to serve God as a worker, though he may have
   uttered many errors and have been mistaken--(and which of us has not
   been?)-- he shall be saved, though his work must be burnt.

   16. Know you not that you are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of
   God dwells in you?Do you know it? He says, "Know you not?" but I might
   leave out the, "not," and say, "Know you that you are the Temple of
   God?" What a wonderful fact it is! Within the body of the saint, God
   dwells, as in a Temple. How some men injure their bodies or utterly
   despise them, though they would not so do if they understood that they
   are the Temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in them.

Justification by Faith

   (No. 3392)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING, APRIL
   28, 1867.

   "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ." Romans 5:1.

   WE desire this evening not to preach upon this text as a mere matter of
   Doctrine. You all believe and understand the Gospel of Justification by
   Faith, but we want to preach upon it tonight as a matter of experience,
   as a thing realized, felt, enjoyed and understood in the soul. I trust
   there are many here who not only know that men may be saved and
   justified by faith, but who can say in their own experience,
   "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ," and who are now, at the present moment, walking
   and living in the actual enjoyment of that peace!

   Wishing to speak of the text, then, in this sense, I shall ask you to
   accompany me not only with your ears and with the attention which you
   usually give so generously, but also with the eyes of your
   self-examination, asking yourselves, as we proceed, step by step, "Do I
   know that? Have I received that? Have I been taught of God in this
   matter? Have I been led into that Truth of God?" And our hope will be
   that some person to whom these things have hitherto been merely
   external and, therefore, valueless, may be led by God to get hold of
   them, so that they may be matters of soul, heart and conscience--so
   that they may enjoy them and find themselves where once they feared
   they would never be, namely, in a state of reconciliation with
   God--happily enjoying peace with the Most High.

   Our first thought shall be some plain, earnest talk concerning--

   I. A FEW PRELIMINARY DISCOVERIES WHICH A MAN MAKES BEFORE HE GETS PEACE
   WITH GOD.

   These, I do not think, are by any means foreign to the text, or merely
   imported to it, but belong rightfully to it. You see that Paul, before
   he came to this justification by faith, had been speaking about sin. It
   would not have been possible for him to have given an intelligent
   definition ofjustification without mentioning that men are sinners,
   without informing them that they had broken God's holy Law and that the
   Law, by and of itself, could never restore them to the favor of God.
   Now, some of these things of which I am going to speak are absolutely
   necessary, if not to my sermon, yet certainly to your spiritually
   understanding even so much as one jot or tittle of what it is to be
   justified by faith!

   Well, then, what are these things? The first discovery that a man is
   led by the Spirit of God to make before he is justified is that it is
   important to be justified in the sight of God. Many people do not know
   this. You shall step into a shop this evening and find a man at the
   counter, and you say to him, "Well, do you never go to a place of
   worship?" "No," he would say, "but I am quite as good as those who do."
   "How so?" "Well, I am a great deal better than some of them." "How is
   that?" "Well, I never failed in business. I never duped people in a
   limited liability company. I never told lies. I am no thief. I am not a
   drunk--I am as honest as the days are long in the middle of June--and
   that is more than you can say of some of your religious, people." Now,
   that man has got a hold of one part of a good man's character. There
   are two parts, but he can only see one, namely, that man is to be just
   to man. He sees that, but he does not see that man is to be also just
   to God. And yet if that man were really to think a little while, he
   would see that the highest obligations of a creature must be not to his
   fellow creatures, but to his Creator--and that however just a man may
   be to another man, yet if he is altogether unjust to God, he cannot
   escape without the severest penalty! But oh, the most of men think that
   so long as they keep the laws of the land, so long as they give to
   their fellow men their due, it matters not though God's day should be a
   subject of scorn, God's will be used as men will and God's Law trodden
   under their feet! Now, I think that everyone here who will but put his
   fingers to his brow for a moment and think, that he will see that even
   though a manmay go before the bar of his country and say before any
   judge or jury, "I have in nothing injured my fellow man. I am just
   before men," yet it does not make the man's character perfect. Unless
   he is also able to say, "And I am also just before the Presence of the
   God who made me and whose servant I am," he has only kept one half--and
   that the less important of God's Law for him.

   It cannot help being--it must be important to the highest degree that
   you and I should stand on good terms with the great God unto whom we
   shall so soon return in the Great Day when He shall say, "Return you
   children of men." We must then render up our souls to Him who created
   us. Well, you can surely go as far as that with me--that it is
   necessary. You do feel, do you not, a desire in your heart to be just
   before your Maker? I am thankful that you can go so far.

   The next thing is this. A man, when the Spirit of God is bringing him
   to Christ, discovers that his past life has been marred badly by
   serious offenses against the Law of God. Before the Spirit of God comes
   into our soul, we are like being in a room in the dark--we cannot see
   in it. We cannot discover the cobwebs, the spiders, the foul and
   loathsome things that may be lurking there. But when the Spirit of God
   comes streaming into the soul, the man is astonished to find that he is
   what he is! And especially if he sits down and opens the Book of the
   Law and, in the light of the Divine Spirit, reads that perfect Law and
   compares it with his own imperfect heart and life! He will then grow
   sick of himself, even to loathing and, sometimes, despair! Take but one
   command. Perhaps there are some here who will say, "I know I have been
   very chaste all my life, for the command says, 'You shall not commit
   adultery,' and I have never broken it--I am clean there." Yes, but now
   hear Christ explain the command, "He that looks upon a woman to lust
   after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart." Now,
   then, who among us can say that we have not done that? Who is there
   upon earth, if that is the meaning of the command, who can say, "I am
   innocent"? If the Law of God, as we are told by Scripture, has to deal
   not with our outward actions, alone, but with our words, and with our
   thoughts and with our imaginations--if it is so exceedingly broad that
   it applies to the most secret part of a man--then who of us can plead
   guiltless before the Throne of God? No, dear Brothers and Sisters, this
   must be understood by you and by me, before we can be justified, that
   we are full of sin! What if I say that we are as full of sin as an egg
   is full of meat? We are all sin! The imagination and the thought of our
   heart is evil and only evil, and that continually. If some of you plume
   yourselves with the notion that you are righteous, I pray God to pluck
   those fine feathers off you and make you see yourselves, for if you
   never see your own nothingness, you will never understand Christ's
   All-Sufficiency! Unless you are pulled down, Christ will never lift you
   up! Unless you know yourselves to be lost, you will never care for that
   Savior who came "to seek and to save the lost." That is a second
   discovery, then, that it is important to be just before God, but that
   on account of the spirituality of God's moral Law and our consequent
   inability to keep it perfectly, we are very far from standing in that
   position.

   Then there comes another discovery, namely, that consequently it is
   utterly impossible for us to hope that we ever can be just before God
   on the footing of our own doing. We must give it up, now, as an utterly
   lost case. The past is past--that can never be blotted out by us! And
   the present, inasmuch as we are weak through the flesh, is not much
   better than the past. And the future, notwithstanding all our fond
   hopes of improvement, will probably be none the better! And so,
   salvation by the works of the Law becomes to us a dreary impossibility!
   The Law said, "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things
   written in the Book of the Law, to do them." I was conversing on one
   occasion with one of our most illustrious Jewish noblemen. And when I
   put to him the question--he believed himself to be perfectly righteous,
   and I believe if any man could be so by his moral conduct, he might
   have fairly laid claim to it--but when I said to him, "Now, there is
   your own Law for it, 'Cursed is everyone that continues not in all
   things written in the Book of the Law, to do them'--have you continued
   in all things?" He said, "I have not." "Then," and I found that to be a
   question for which he, at any rate, had no answer--and it is a
   question, which, when properly understood, no man can answer except by
   pointing to the Cross of Christ and saying, "He was made a curse for us
   that we might be made a blessing." Unless you and I keep the Law of God
   perfectly, it matters little how near we get to perfection! It is as
   though God had committed to our trust a perfect crystal vase and had
   said, "If you keep that whole, and present it to me, you shall have a
   reward." But we have cracked it, chipped it--ah, my Brothers and
   Sisters, the most of us have broken it and smashed it to pieces! But we
   will suppose that we have only cracked it a little. Yes, but even then
   we have lost the reward, for the condition was that it should be
   perfectly whole--and the slightest chip is a violation of the condition
   upon which the reward would have been given! But you say that you will
   not break it farther. But you have broken it! You have thrown
   yourselves outof the list. It sometimes seems hard when you tell people
   that if they have violated the Law in one point, they have broken the
   whole of it--but it is not so hard as it looks to be, for if I tell a
   man who is going down a coal mine on a long chain that if he breaks one
   link of the chain, it does not matter though all the other hundreds or
   thousands of links may be sound--if there is only one link that is
   broken--down will descend the basket and the poor miner will be dashed
   to pieces! Nobody thinks that is difficult. Everybody recognizes that
   as being a matter of mechanical law that the strength of a chain must
   be measured by its weakest part. And so, the strength of our obedience
   must be gauged by the very point in which it fails. Alas, our obedience
   has failed and, through it, no one of us can ever be just before God!

   Now, I want to stop a minute and put the question round the galleries
   and below stairs. Have you all got as far as that? It is important to
   be just before God--we see that we are not so--do we see that we cannot
   be so? Are we quite convinced that by our own obedience to the Law of
   God, it is hopeless for us to think of standing accepted before the
   Most High? I pray the Eternal Spirit to convince you all of this, or
   you will keep on knocking at the door until you are quite sure that God
   has nailed it up forever! And you will go scrambling over that Alp and
   tumbling down this precipice until you are convinced that it is
   impossible for you to climb it--and then you will give up your
   desperate endeavor and come to God in God's way--which is quite another
   way from your own! I trust that we are all convinced of this.

   Let us notice one more preliminary discovery. A man, having found out
   all this, suddenly discovers that inasmuch as he is not just before God
   and cannot be, he is at the present moment under condemnation! God is
   never indifferent towards sin. If, therefore, a man is not in a state
   in which God can justify him, he is in a state in which God must
   condemn him! If you are not just before God, you are condemned at this
   very moment! You are not executed, it is true, but the condemnation has
   gone forth against you and the sign that it is so is your unbelief,
   for, "He that believes not is condemned already, because he has not
   believed on the Son of God." How some of you would spring up from your
   seats tonight if all of a sudden you got the information that you had
   been condemned by the courts of your country! But when I say that you
   have been condemned by the Court of Heaven, this glides across your
   conscience like drops of water, or oil over a marble slab! And yet, my
   Hearers, if you did but know the meaning of what I am saying--and I
   pray God the Holy Spirit to make you know it, it would make your very
   bones quiver! God has condemned you! You are out of Christ! You have
   broken His Law! God has lifted His hand to smite you! And though His
   mercy tarries for awhile, yet days and hours will soon be gone--and
   then the condemnation shall take the shape of execution--and where will
   your soul be, then? Now, you must have the sentence of condemnation
   passed in your own soul, or else you will never be justified, for until
   we are condemned by ourselves, we are not acquitted by God! Again I
   pause and say, Do you feel this, my dear Hearer? If you do, instead of
   despairing, be hopeful! If you have the sentence of death within you,
   be thankful for it, for now shall life be given you from the hand of
   God's Grace!

   Having occupied, perhaps, too much time over that, we now come more
   immediately into the text to--

   II. SHOW THE GOSPEL LEARNING WHICH IS TAUGHT TO US BY THE SPIRIT OF
   GOD.

   That Gospel learning I may give you in a few sentences, namely, these,
   that inasmuch as through man's sin, the way of obedience is forever
   closed, so that we--none of us--can ever pass by it to a true
   righteousness, God has now determined to deal with men in a way of
   mercy, to forgive them all their offenses, to bestow upon them His
   love, to receive them graciously and to love them freely! He has been
   pleased, in His Infinite Wisdom, to devise a way by which, without
   injury to His Justice, He can yet receive the most undeserving sons of
   men into His heart and make them His children-- and can bless them with
   all the blessings which would have been theirs had they perfectly kept
   His Law, but which now shall come to them as a matter of gift and
   undeserved Grace from Himself.

   I trust we have learned that that there is a plan of salvation by Grace
   and, by Grace alone--and it is a great thing to know that where Grace
   is, there are no works!

   It is a blessed thing to never muddle in your head the Doctrine of
   working and the Doctrine of receiving by Grace, for there is an
   essential and eternal difference between the two. I hope you all know
   that there can be no mixing of the two. If we are saved by Grace, it
   cannot be by our own merits! But if we depend upon our own merits, then
   we cannot appeal to the Grace of God, since the two things can never be
   mingled together. It must be all works or else all Grace. Now, God's
   plan of salvation excludes all our works. "Not of works, lest any man
   should boast." It comes to us upon the footing of Divine Grace, pure
   Grace alone. And this is God's plan, namely that inasmuch as we cannot
   be saved by our own obedience, we should be saved by Christ's
   obedience! Jesus, the Son of God, has appeared in the flesh, has lived
   a life of obedience to God's Law and, in consequence of that obedience,
   being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself and became obedient
   unto death, even the death of the Cross! And our Savior's life and
   death make up a complete keeping and honoring of that Law of God which
   we have broken and dishonored. And God's plan is this--"I cannot bless
   you for your own sakes, but I will bless you for His sake. Looking at
   you, I must curse you, but I have laid the curse on Him and now,
   looking at you through Him, I can bless you though you deserve it not.
   I can pass by your undeserving. I can blot out your sins like a cloud
   and cast your iniquities into the depths of the sea through what He has
   done. You have no merits, but He has boundless merits! You are full of
   sin and must be punished, but He has been punished instead of you--and
   now I can deal with you." This is the language of God put into human
   words, "I can deal with you upon terms of mercy through the merits of
   My dear Son." This is the way in which the Gospel comes to you, then.
   If you believe in Jesus--that is to say if you trust Him--all the
   merits of Jesus are your merits and are imputed to you. All the
   sufferings of Jesus are your sufferings. Every one of His merits is
   imputed to you. You stand before God as if you were Christ, because
   Christ stood before God as if He were you--He in your place, you in His
   place. Substitution! That is the word! Christ, the Substitute for
   sinners! Christ standing for men and bearing the thunderbolts of the
   Divine opposition to all sin! He "who knew no sin, being made sin for
   us." Man standing in Christ's place and receiving the sunlight of
   Divine favor, instead of Christ.

   And this, I say, is through trusting, or believing! God's way of your
   getting connection with Christ is through your reliance upon Him.
   "Therefore, being justified"--how? Not by works! That is not the link,
   but--"being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ." Christ offers to God the substitution--through faith we
   accept it--and from that moment God accepts us!

   Now, I want to come to this, dear Friends. Do you know this? Have you
   been taught this by the Spirit of God? Perhaps you learned it in the
   Assembly's Catechism when you were but children. You have learned it in
   the various classes since then, but do you know it in your own soul and
   do you know that God's way of salvation is through a simple dependence
   upon His dear Son? Do you so know it that you have accepted it and that
   you are now resting upon Jesus? If so, then thrice happy are you!

   But, going further, I have now to dwell for a minute or two upon--

   III. THE GLORIOUS PRIVILEGE OF THE TEXT.

   We have led you, and I hope the Spirit of God has led you, too, through
   the preliminary discoveries and through the great discovery that God
   can save us through the merits of Another! Now let us notice this
   glorious privilege word by word.

   "Being justified." The text tells us that every believing man is at the
   present moment perfectly justified before God. You know what Adam was
   in naked innocence in Paradise. Such is every Believer. Yes, and more
   than that. Adam could talk with God because he was pure from sin and
   we, also, have access with boldness unto God our Father because,
   through Jesus' blood, we are clean. Now, I do not say that this is the
   privilege of a few eminent saints, but here I look around these pews
   and see my Brothers and Sisters--scores and hundreds of them--all of
   whom are tonight just before God--perfectly so! Completely so--so just
   that they never can be otherwise than just--so just that even in Heaven
   they will be no more acceptable to God than they are here tonight! That
   is the state into which faith brings a poor, lost, guilty, helpless,
   good-for-nothing sinner! The man may have been everything that was bad
   before he believed in Jesus, but as soon as he trusted Christ, the
   merits of Christ became his merits and he stands before God as though
   he were perfect, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing," through
   the righteousness of Christ!

   Note, however, as we have noticed the state of justification, the means
   whereby we reach it. "Being justified by faith." The way of reaching
   this state ofjustification is not by tears, nor prayers, nor humbling,
   nor working, nor Bible-reading, nor Church-going, nor Chapel-going, nor
   sacraments, nor priestly absolution, but by faith--which faith is a
   simple and utter dependence and believing in the faithfulness of God--a
   dependence upon the promise of God because it is God's promise--and is
   worthy of dependence. It is a reliance with all our might upon what God
   has said! This is faith--and every man or woman who possesses this
   faith is perfectly justified tonight!

   I know what the devil will say to you. He will say to you, "You are a
   sinner!" Tell him you know you are, but that for all that, you are
   justified. He will tell you of the greatness of your sin. Tell him of
   the greatness of Christ's righteousness. He will tell you of all your
   mishaps and your backslidings, of your offenses and your wanderings.
   Tell him and tellyour own conscience, that you know all that, but that
   Jesus Christ came to save sinners, and that although your sin is great,
   Christ is quite able to put it all away. Some of you, it seems to me,
   do not trust in Christ as sinners. You get a mingle-mangle kind of
   faith. You trust in Christ as though you thought Christ could do
   something for you--and you could do the rest. I tell you that while you
   look to yourselves, you do not know what faith means! You must be
   convinced that there is nothing good in yourselves--you must know that
   you are sinners and that in your hearts you are as big and as black a
   sinner as the very worst and vilest--and you must come to Jesus and
   leave your fancied righteousnesses, and your pretended goodnesses
   behind you! And you must take Him for everything and trust in Him. Oh,
   to feel your sin, and yet to know your righteousness--to have the two
   together--repentance on account of sin, and yet a glorious confidence
   in the all-atoning Sacrifice! Oh, if you could understand that saying
   of the spouse, "I am black, but comely"--for that is where we must
   come--black in myself, as black as Hell, and yet comely, fair, lovely,
   inexpressibly glorious through the righteousness of Jesus!

   My dear Brothers and Sisters, can you feel this? If you cannot feel it,
   do you believe it? And do you sing in the words of Joseph Hart--

   "In your Surety you are free, His dear hands were pierced for thee!
   With your Savior's vesture on, Holy as the Holy One."

   For so it is--you stand before God as accepted as Christ is accepted
   and, notwithstanding the inbred sin and corruption of your heart, you
   are as dear to God as Christ is dear and as accepted in the
   righteousness of Christ as Christ is accepted in His own obedience!

   Have we got so far? That is the point on which I want to enquire this
   evening. Have you got as far as to know at this moment that it is
   through faith we are justified? If so, I shall conduct you just one
   step farther, namely to observe--and this is coming back, while it is
   also going forward--that "we are justified by faith through our Lord
   Jesus Christ." There is the foundation! There is the mainspring! There
   is the tree that bears the fruit! We are justified by faith, but not by
   faith in itself. Faith in itself is a precious Grace, but it cannot in
   itselfjustify us. It is " through our Lord Jesus Christ." Simple as the
   observation is, I must venture to repeat it tonight because it is hard
   for us to keep it in mind. Remember that faith is not the work of the
   Spirit within, but the work of Christ upon the tree! That upon which I
   must rest as my meritorious hope is not the blessed fact that I am now
   an heir of Heaven, but the still more blessed fact that the Son of God
   loved me and gave Himself for me! My dear Brothers and Sisters, when
   all is fair weather within, there is such a temptation to say, "Well,
   now, it is all right with me, for I feel this and I feel that." Very
   good, these evidences are in their places, but oh, when it grows dark
   and when, instead of these gracious evidences, you get equally clear
   evidences that you are not perfect--when you have to say, "Oh wretched
   man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" You
   will find that instead of your beautiful evidences, you will have to
   fly to the Cross! There was a time when I, too, could take a great deal
   of comfort in what I believe is the Spirit of God's work in my soul. I
   do thank God for it, and bless Him for it now, but I trust I have
   learned to walk where poor Jack the huckster, walked--

   "Im a poor sinner, and nothing at all! But Jesus Christ is my
   All-in-All."

   Brothers and Sisters, it is down on the ground that we must live! We
   must build upon the Rock, itself! On the top of some mountains men
   sometimes build heaps of timber, so as to get a little higher. Well,
   now, some of these rickety platforms, you know, get shaky, but when you
   get right down on the mountain, itself, it never shakes and you are
   perfectly secure there! So sometimes we get to building up our rickety
   platforms of our experience and our good works--all very well in their
   way, but then they shake in the storm! Depend upon it, that the soul
   that clings to the Rock, notwithstanding all that the Holy Spirit has
   done for it, and having nothing, then, to depend upon, more than the
   poor dying thief had when, without a single good work, he had to hang
   on the dying Christ, alone--oh, believe me, that soul is in the safest
   place to live in--and the most blessed place to die in! None but Jesus!
   None but Jesus for a poor sinner when he is torn from his cups and his
   sins! And none but Jesus for the aged saint when he stays himself upon
   his bed to bear his last testimony--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring--

   Simply to Your Cross I cling."

   "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ."

   And now, to crown all, there is here the precious, precious privilege
   which such men enjoy--"we have peace with God." I know that this may
   seem a trifle to thoughtless people, but not to those who think! I
   cannot say that I sympathize with those people who shut their eyes to
   the beauties of Nature. I have heard of good men travelling through
   fine scenery and shutting their eyes for fear they should see! I always
   open mine as wide as ever I can because I think I can see God in all
   the works of His hands--and what God has taken the trouble to make, I
   think I ought to take the trouble to look at! Surely there must be
   something to see in a man's works if he is a wise man--and there must
   be something worth seeing in the works of God who is All-Wise! Now, it
   is a delightful thing to say, when you look upon a landscape lit up
   with sunlight and shaded with clouds, "Well, my Father made all this. I
   never saw Him, but I do delight in the work of His hands--He made all
   this and I am perfectly at peace with Him." Then as you are standing
   there, a storm comes on. Big drops begin to fall. There is thunder in
   the distance. It begins to peal louder and louder. Presently there
   comes a flash of lightning. Now, those who are not at peace with God
   may go and flee away, but those who are perfectly at peace with Him may
   stand there and say, "Well, it is my Father who is doing all this. That
   is His voice, the voice of the Lord which is full of majesty." I love
   to hear my Father's voice. I am never as happy as in a tremendous
   storm--and when the lightning flash comes, I think--well, it is only
   the flashing of my Father's eyes! Now, God is abroad--He seemed as if
   He had left the world before, but now He comes riding on the wings of
   the wind! Let me go and meet Him. I am not afraid!

   Suppose you are out at sea in a storm. You are justified by faith, and
   you say, "Well, let the waves roar! Let them clap their hands! My
   Father holds the waters in the hollow of His hand, why should I be
   afraid?" Let me say to you that it is worth something to believe that
   God can put us in a calm state of mind when "earth is all in arms
   abroad." It is just so with the Believer when temporal troubles come.
   There comes crash after crash until it seems as though every house of
   business would come down. Nothing is certain. Man has lost confidence
   and reliance in his fellow man. Everything is going bad. But the
   Christian says, "God is at the helm. The whole business of business is
   managed by the great King--let the sons of earth do as they will, but--

   "He everywhere has sway, And all things serve His might."

   It is something to feel that my Father cannot do me a bad turn. Even if
   He should use His rod upon me, it will do me good, and I will thank Him
   for it, for I am at perfect peace with Him.

   And then to come to die and to feel, "I am going to God and I am glad
   to go, for I am not going like a prisoner to a judge, but like a wife
   espoused goes to her husband--like a child home from school to the
   parents' arms. Oh, it is something to die with a sense of peace with
   God! Surely every thoughtful man will feel that! Now, if you trust
   Christ, you shall be justified by faith. Being justified, your heart
   shall feel that perfect peace is brought into it, so that you shall
   meet your Father' s will with perfect equanimity, let it be what it
   may! Come life, come death, it shall not matter to you, for all is
   right between God and your soul!

   Oh, I wish it were so with all present! It may be so if God the Spirit
   brings you to rest in Jesus. No, it shallbe so, my dear Friend! It
   shall be so with you tonight! Though you never thought it would be when
   you came in here, yet you see it all now. It is simply believing,
   simply trusting! Oh, believe Him! Trust Him and it shall be the joy of
   your soul to have a peace with God which as the world did not give
   you--so the world shall never take away! But you shall have it forever
   and ever! God grant it to each one of us! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE15:25-32.

   Most of us recognize the beauty of this parable as it concerns the
   prodigal and his boundless forgiveness by the father, but few of us
   probably have seen how the elder brother has his portrait also painted
   by our Lord and how He sets forth the self-righteous professor who
   hates to have prodigals made much of.

   25. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to
   the house, he heard music and dancing. This was the better one of the
   two. I have heard him often greatly blamed and so he deserves to be.
   But for all that, he was a true son. He was not at home. He was out at
   work. There are some Christians that are all for work and never seem to
   have any fellowship and communion. They are always active, but they are
   not always contemplative. He was in the field.

   26. And he called one of the servants and asked him what these things
   meant He was a gloomy spirit--good, solid, regular, constant--but not
   very joyful. He took things rather severely, so he did not understand
   what this amusement could mean. "Some of the Salvation Army got in
   here," he said. "Some of those boisterous Methodist people got here and
   I do not like it. I am more regular than that. I do not like these rows
   and uproars. He asked of the servant what these things meant.

   27. 28. And he said unto him, Your brother is come: and your father has
   killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound. And
   he was angry, and would not go in. No, I dare say he was glad his
   brother was back, but he did not like such a fuss made over him. He was
   glad to see a wandering one restored, but why, why, why should there be
   all this extravagance of joy concerning this wandering young fellow who
   had been no better than he should be? Why all this delight? And there
   are some kinds of Christians who always feel that when there is a
   sinner introduced into the Church, "Well, I hope that it will turn out
   a genuine case," and always that is the first thought! They are afraid
   that it cannot be. They have never sinned in that way. They have been
   kept by the Grace of God from outward transgression and they are half
   afraid to hear of these outrageous sinners being brought in and so much
   joy made over them. "He was angry, and would not go in."

   28. Therefore came his father out, and entreated him. He was worth
   fetching in. There was a good deal of solid worth in his character and
   his father kindly came to ask him to come in and share the joy.

   29. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years have I
   served you. You may read it, "slaved for you."

   29. Neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and yet you
   never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. Here have
   I been constant in the House of Prayer, regular at my Sunday school
   class--and yet I get little or no joy from it. I go on just in the
   regular path of duty but I have no music and dancing! I have a great
   many doubts and fears, but very little exhilaration, very little
   delight.

   30. But as soon as this, your son, was come, which has devoured your
   living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf He has
   been a great sinner and he is newly converted--and he has got all the
   joy! He has been running, anyhow, and yet he is full of assurance, full
   of delight, full of confidence. How can this be? I am a staid Christian
   having but slight joy, and he is but newly converted, but confident and
   full of delight. You have killed the fatted calf for him! But even one
   of the little kid goats you have never given me. You have given him the
   fatted calf.

   31. And he said unto him, Son, you are always with me, and all
   thatIhave is yours. Why did not this son wake up to his privileges?
   Instead of not having a kid, he might have had whatever he liked! "All
   that I have is yours." He had been put into such a position as that,
   instead of being badly treated as he, perhaps, would half accuse his
   father of treating him. "Son, you are always with me. You live at my
   table. My house is your house. I love you and delight in you. All that
   I have is yours."

   32. It was meet--It was right, it was proper, it was fitting--

   32. That we should make merry, and be glad, for this, your brother.
   "You call him my son, but he is your brother, and I remind you of
   it--this, your brother."

   32. Was dead, and is alive again: and was lost, and is found. So if
   there are any here that do not take the joy which they ought in the
   conversion of great sinners, let them hear the gentle persuasive voice
   of God. You, as Believers, have everything! Christ is yours. Heaven is
   yours. You are always with God and all that He has belongs to you. But
   it is proper and fit that when a sinner returns from the error of his
   ways, they should ring the bells of Heaven and make a fuss over him,
   for he was dead and is alive again! I hope that you and I will never
   catch the spirit of the elder brother. Yet I remember that Krummacher
   says that he sometimes found that same spirit in himself. There was a
   man in the village where Krummacher lived, who was a great drunkard and
   everything that was bad. But all of a sudden he came into a very large
   sum of money and became a wealthy man. Krummacher felt, "Well, this
   hardly looks like the right thing--so many good, honest, hard-working
   people in the parish still remaining poor, and this worthless man has
   suddenly become wealthy and well-to-do." It seemed a strange way in the
   order of Providence. Oh, we ought to rejoice and be glad when another
   person prospers! And we ought to wish that his prosperity may be
   blessed to him.

   I remember a minister years ago, when first Mr. Moody came, saying that
   he did not believe that Mr. Moody was sent of God, "Because," he said,
   "I find that many of the people who are converted under him never went
   to a place of worship before. It is only the riffraff that are brought
   in." There is a nasty elder brother spirit! The riffraff were just the
   people that we wanted to bring in and if they had never been to a place
   of worship before, it was time that they should go! It was a mercy that
   they were brought in! Oh, instead of ever sniffing at sinners as if we
   were better than they, let us welcome them with all our heart and
   praise the heavenly Father that He so lovingly takes them in!

Wheat in the Barn

   (No. 3393)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But gather the wheat into My bairn." Matthew 13:30.

   "GATHER the wheat into My barn." Then the purpose of the Son of Man
   will be accomplished. He sowed good seed and He shall have His barn
   filled with it at the last. Be not dispirited, Christ will not be
   disappointed. "He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be
   satisfied." He went forth weeping, bearing precious seed, but He shall
   come again rejoicing, bringing His sheaves with Him.

   "Gather the wheat into My barn." Then Satan's policy will be
   unsuccessful. The enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, hopeful
   that the false wheat would destroy or materially injure the true--but
   he failed in the end, for the wheat ripened and was ready to be
   gathered. Christ's garner shall be filled--the tares shall not choke
   the wheat. The Evil One will be put to shame!

   In gathering in the wheat, good angels will be employed--"the angels
   are the reapers." This casts special scorn upon the great evil angel.
   He sows the tares and tries to destroy the harvest and, therefore, the
   good angels are brought in to celebrate his defeat and to rejoice
   together with their Lord in the success of the Divine Husbandry. Satan
   will make a poor profit out of his meddling--he shall be defeated in
   all his efforts and so the threat shall be fulfilled, "Upon your belly
   shall you go, and dust shall you eat."

   By giving the angels work to do, all intelligent creatures, of whose
   existence we have information, are made to take an interest in the work
   of Grace--whether for malice or for adoration, redemption excites them
   all. The wonderful works of God are made manifest to all, for these
   things were not done in a corner.

   We too much forget the angels. Let us not overlook their tender
   sympathy with us--they behold the Lord rejoicing over our
   repentance--and they rejoice with Him1 They are our watchers and the
   Lord's messengers of mercy. They bear us up in their hands lest we dash
   our foot against a stone. And when we come to die, they carry us to the
   bosom of our Lord. It is one of our joys that we have come to an
   innumerable company of angels--let us think of them with affection.

   At this time I will keep to my text and preach from it almost word by
   word. It begins with, "but," and that is--

   I. A WORD OF SEPARATION.

   Here note that the tares and the wheat will grow together until the
   time of harvest shall come. It is a great sorrow of heart to some of
   the wheat to be growing side by side with tares. The ungodly are as
   thorns and briars to those who fear the Lord. How frequently is the
   sigh forced forth from the godly heart, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in
   Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!" A man's foes are often
   found within his own household. Those who should have been his best
   helpers are often his worst hinderers. Their conversation vexes and
   torments him. It is of little use to try to escape from them, for the
   tares are permitted, in God's Providence, to grow with the wheat--and
   they will do so until the end. Good men have emigrated to distant lands
   to found communities in which there should be none but saints, but,
   alas, sinners have sprung up in their own families! The attempt to weed
   the ungodly and heretical out of the settlement has led to persecution
   and other evils--and the whole plan has proven a failure. Others have
   shut themselves away in hermitages to avoid the temptations of the
   world, and so have hoped to win the victory by running away--this is
   not the way of wisdom! The word for this present is, "Let both grow
   together." But there will come a time when a final separation will be
   made. Then, dear Christian woman, your husband will never persecute you
   again! Godly sister, your brother will heap no more ridicule upon you!
   Pious workman, there will be no more jesting and taunting from the
   ungodly! That, "but,"will be an iron gate between the God-fearing and
   the godless! Then will the tares be cast into the fire, but the Lord of
   the harvest will say, "Gather the wheat into My barn."

   This separation must be made, for the growing of the wheat and the
   tares together on earth has caused much pain and injury and, therefore,
   it will not be continued in a happier world. We can very well suppose
   that godly men and women might be willing that their unconverted
   children should dwell with them in Heaven, but it cannot be, for God
   will not have His cleansed ones defiled, nor His glorified ones tried
   by the presence of the unbelieving. The tares must be taken away in
   order to the perfectness and usefulness of the wheat. Would you have
   the tares and the wheat heaped up together in the granary in one mass?
   That would be bad husbandry with a vengeance! They can neither of them
   be put to appropriate use till thoroughly separated. Even so, mark you,
   the saved and the unsaved may live together here, but they will not
   live together in another world! The command is absolute--"Gather the
   tares and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into
   My barn." Sinner, can you hope to enter Heaven? You never loved your
   mother's God and is He to endure you in His heavenly courts? You never
   trusted your father's Savior and yet are you to behold His Glory
   forever? Are you to go swaggering down the streets of Heaven, letting
   fall an oath, or singing a loose song? Why, you know you get tired of
   the worship of God on the Lord's Day--do you think that the Lord will
   endure unwilling worshippers in the Temple above? The Sabbath is a
   wearisome day to you--how can you hope to enter into the Sabbath of
   God? You have no taste for heavenly pursuits and these things would be
   profaned if you were permitted to partake in them! Therefore that word,
   "but," must come in and you must part from the Lord's people, never to
   meet again! Can you bear to think of being divided from godly friends
   forever and ever?

   That separation involves an awful difference of destiny. "Gather the
   tares in bundles to burn them." I do not dare to draw the picture, but
   when the bundle is bound up, there is no place for it except the fire.
   God grant that you may never know all the anguish which burning must
   mean, but may you escape from it at once. It is no trifle which the
   Lord of Love compares to being consumed with fire. I am quite certain
   that no words of mine can ever set forth its terror. They say that we
   speak dreadful things about the wrath to come, but I am sure that we
   understate the case. What must the tender, loving, gracious Jesus have
   meant by the words, "Gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn
   them"? See what a wide distinction there is between the lot of the
   Lord's people and Satan's people! Burn the wheat? Oh, no--"Gather the
   wheat into My barn." There let them be happily, safely housed forever!
   Oh, the infinite distance between Heaven and Hell!--the harps and the
   angels, and the wailing and gnashing of teeth! Who can ever measure the
   width of that gulf which divides the glorified saint, robed in white
   and crowned with immortality, from the soul which is driven forever
   away from the Presence of God and from the Glory of His power? It is a
   dreadful, "but"--that, "but" of separation! I pray you, remember that
   it will interpose between brother and brother--between mother and
   child--between husband and wife. "One shall be taken and the other
   left." And when that sword shall descend to divide, there shall never
   be any union later!

   The separation is eternal. There is no hope or possibility of change in
   the world to come. "But," says one, "that dreadful ' but'! Why must
   there be such a difference? The answer is because there always was a
   difference! The wheat was sown by the Son of Man--the false wheat was
   sown by the enemy. There was always a difference in character--the
   wheat was good, the tares were evil. This difference did not appear at
   first, but it became more and more apparent as the wheat ripened and as
   the tares ripened, too. They were totally different plants--and so a
   regenerate person and an unregene-rate person are altogether different
   beings. I have heard an unregenerate man say that he is quite as good
   as the godly man, but in so boasting he betrayed his pride. Surely
   there is as great a difference in God' s sight between the unsaved and
   the Believer as between darkness and light, or between the dead and the
   living! There is in the one a life which there is not in the other--and
   the difference is vital and radical. Oh, that you may never trifle with
   this essential matter, but really be the wheat of the Lord! It is vain
   to have the name of wheat--we must have the nature of wheat! God will
   not be mocked--He will not be pleased by our calling ourselves
   Christians while we are not! Be not satisfied with Church membership,
   but seek after membership with Christ! Do not talk about faith, but
   exercise it! Do not boast of experience, but possess it. Be not like
   the wheat, but be the wheat! No shams and imitations will stand in the
   Last Great Day! That terrible, "but," will roll as a sea of fire
   between the true and the false! Oh, Holy Spirit, let each of us be
   found transformed by Your power! The next word of our text is,
   "gather,"--that is--

   II. A WORD OF CONGREGATION.

   What a blessed thing this gathering is! I feel it a great pleasure to
   gather multitudes together to hear the Gospel! And is it not a joy to
   see a house full of people on weekdays and Sundays who are willing to
   leave their homes and to come considerable distances to listen to the
   Gospel? It is a great thing to gather people together for that, but the
   gathering of the wheat into the barn is a far more wonderful business.
   Gathering is, in itself, better than scattering, and I pray that the
   Lord Jesus may always exercise His attracting power in this place, for
   He is no Divider, but, "unto Him shall the gathering of the people be."
   Has He not said, "I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all
   men unto Me"?

   Observe that the congregation mentioned in our text is selected and
   assembled by skiiled gatherers.' 'The angels are the reapers."
   Ministers could not do it, for they do not know all the Lord's wheat
   and they are apt to make mistakes-- some by too great leniency and
   others by excessive severity. Our poor judgments occasionally shut out
   saints and often shut in sinners. The angels will know their Master' s
   property. They know each saint, for they were present at his birthday.
   Angels know when sinners repent and they never forget the persons of
   the penitents. They have witnessed the lives of those who have believed
   and have helped them in their spiritual battles, and so they know them.
   Yes, angels by a holy instinct discern the Father' s children and are
   not to be deceived. They will not fail to gather all the wheat and to
   leave out every tare!

   But they are gathered under a very stringent regulation, for, first of
   all, according to the parable, the tares--the false wheat--have been
   taken out and then the angelic reapers gather nothing but the wheat.
   The seed of the serpent, fathered by Satan, is thus separated from the
   seed of the Kingdom, owned by Jesus, the promised Deliverer. This is
   the one distinction and no other is taken into consideration. If the
   most amiable unconverted persons could stand in the ranks with the
   saints, the angels would not bear them to Heaven, for the mandate is,
   "Gather the wheat." Could the most honest man be found standing in the
   center of the Church, with all the members round about him and with all
   the ministers entreating that he might be spared, yet if he were not a
   Believer, he could not be carried into the Divine garner! There is no
   help for it. The angels have no choice in the matter--the peremptory
   command is, "Gather the wheat," and they must gather none else!

   It will be a gathering from very great distances. Some of the wheat
   ripens in the South Sea Islands, in China, and in Japan. Some
   flourishes in France, broad acres grow in the United States--there is
   scarcely a land without a portion of the good grain! Where all God's
   wheat grows, I cannot tell. There is a remnant, according to the
   election of Grace, among every nation and people, but the angels will
   gather all the good grain to the same garner.

   "Gather the wheat." The saints will be found in all ranks of society.
   The angels will bring in a few ears from palaces and great armfuls from
   cottages! Many will be collected from the lowly cottages of our
   villages and hamlets, and others will be raised up from the back slums
   of our great cities to the metropolis of God! From the darkest places
   angels will bring those children of sweetness and light who seldom
   beheld the sun, and yet were pure in heart and saw their God! The
   hidden and obscure shall be brought into the Light of God, for the Lord
   knows them that are His--and His harvest-men will not miss them.

   To me, it is a charming thought that they will come from all the ages.
   Let us hope that our first father, Adam, will be there. And mother Eve,
   following in the footsteps of their dear son, Abel, and trusting in the
   same Sacrifice. We shall meet Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses,
   and David, and Daniel, and all the saints made perfect! What a joy to
   see the Apostles, martyrs, and Reformers! I long to see Luther, and
   Calvin, and Bunyan, and Whitfield. I like the rhyme of good old father
   Ryland--

   "They all shall be there, the great and the small! Poor I shall shake
   hands with the blessed St. Paul."

   I do not know how that will be, but I have not much doubt that we shall
   have fellowship with all the saints of every age in the general
   assembly and Church of the First-Born, whose names are written in
   Heaven!

   No matter when or where the wheat grew, it shall be gathered into the
   one barn--gathered never to be scattered-- gathered out of all
   divisions of the visible Church, never to be divided again! They grew
   in different fields. Some flourished on the hillside where
   Episcopalians grow in all their glory! And others in the lowlier soil,
   where Baptists multiply, and Methodists flourish! But once the wheat is
   in the barn, none can tell in which field the ears grew. Then, indeed,
   shall the Master' s prayer have a glorious answer--"That they all may
   be one." All our errors removed and our mistakes corrected and
   forgiven, the one Lord, the one faith and the one Baptism will be known
   of us all--and there will be no more displeasure and envying! What a
   blessed gathering it will be! What a meeting! The elect of God, the
   elite of all the centuries, of whom the world was not worthy! I should
   not like to be away. If there were no Hell, it would be Hell enough to
   me to be shut out of such heavenly society! If there were no weeping,
   and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, it would be dreadful enough to miss
   the Presence of the Lord, and the joy of praising Him forever, and the
   bliss of meeting with all the noblest beings that ever lived! Amid the
   necessary controversies of the age, I, who have been doomed to seem a
   man of strife, sigh for the blessed rest wherein all spiritual minds
   shall blend in eternal accord before the Throne of God and of the Lamb.
   Oh, that we were all right, that we might be all happily united in one
   spirit! In the text there is next--

   III. A WORD OF DESIGNATION.

   I have already trespassed upon that domain. "Gather the wheat" Nothing
   but "the wheat" will be placed in the Lord's homestead. Lend me your
   hearts while I urge you to a searching examination for a minute or two.
   The wheat was sown of the Lord. Are you sown of the Lord? Friend, if
   you have any religion, how did you get it? Was it self-sown? If so, it
   is good for nothing! The true wheat was sown by the Son of Man. Are you
   sown of the Lord? Did the Spirit of God drop eternal life into your
   bosom? Did it come from that dear hand which was nailed to the Cross?
   Is Jesus your life? Does your life begin and end with Him? If so, it is
   well!

   The wheat was sown of the Lord--it is also the object of the Lord's
   care. Wheat needs a deal of attention. The farmer would get nothing
   from it if he did not watch it carefully. Are you under the Lord's
   care? Does He keep you? Is that word true of your soul, "I the Lord do
   keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it
   night and day"? Do you experience such keeping? Give an honest answer,
   as you love your soul.

   Next, wheat is a useful thing, a gift from God for the life of men. The
   false wheat was of no good to anybody--it could only be eaten of
   swine--and then it made them stagger like drunken men! Are you one of
   those who are wholesome in society, who are like bread to the world, so
   that if men receive you, your example and your teaching, they will be
   blessed thereby? Judge yourselves whether you are good or evil in life
   and influence.

   "Gather the wheat." You know that God must put the goodness, the Grace,
   the solidity and the usefulness into you, or else you will never be
   wheat fit for angelic gathering. One thing is true of the wheat--that
   it is the most dependent of all plants. I have never heard of a field
   of wheat which sprang up and grew and ripened without a farmer's care.
   Some ears may appear after a harvest when the corn has shaled out, but
   I have never heard of plains in America or elsewhere covered with
   unsown wheat. No, no. There is no wheat where there is no man, and
   there is no Grace where there is no Christ! We owe our very existence
   to the Father, who is the Farmer.

   Yet, dependent as it is, wheat stands in the front rank of honor and
   esteem--and so do the godly in the judgment of all who are of an
   understanding heart. We are nothing without Christ--but with Him we are
   full of honor. Oh, to be among those by whom the world is preserved,
   the excellent of the earth in whom the saints delight! God forbid we
   should be among the base and worthless tares! Our last head, upon which
   also I will speak briefly, is--

   IV. A WORD OF DESTINATION.

   "Gather the wheat into My barn.''" The process of gathering in the
   wheat will be completed at the Day of Judgment, but it is going on
   every day. From hour to hour saints are gathered--they are going
   heavenward even now. I am so glad to hear as a regular thing that the
   departed ones from my own dear Church have such joy in being harvested.
   Glory be to God, our people die well! The best thing is to live well,
   but we are greatly gladdened to hear that the brethren die well, for,
   full often, that is the most telling witness for vital godliness. Men
   of the world feel the power of triumphant deaths!

   Every hour the saints are being gathered into the barn. That is where
   they want to be. We feel no pain at the news of ingathering, for we
   wish to be safely stored up by our Lord. If the wheat that is in the
   field could speak, every grain would say, "The ultimatum for which we
   are living and growing is the barn, the granary." For this the frosty
   night! For this the sunny days! For this the dew and the rain--and for
   this everything! Every process with the wheat is tending towards the
   granary. So is it with us--everything is working towards
   Heaven--towards the gathering place--towards the congregation of the
   righteous--towards the vision of our Redeemer's face! Our death will
   cause no jar in our life-music! It will involve no pause, or even
   discord--it is part of a program--the crowning of our whole history!

   To the wheat the barn is the place of security. It dreads no mildew
   there. It fears no frost, no heat, no drought, no wet when once in the
   barn. All its growth-perils are past. It has reached its perfection. It
   has rewarded the labor of the

   Farmer and it is housed. Oh, long-expected day, begin! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, what a blessing it will be when you and I shall have come to
   our maturity and Christ shall see in us the travail of His soul!

   I delight to think of Heaven as His barn! His barn, what must that be?
   It is but the poverty of language that such an expression has to be
   used at all concerning the home of our Father, the dwelling of Jesus!
   Heaven is the palace of the King, but so far to us a barn because it is
   the place of security, the place of rest forever! It is the homestead
   of Christ to which we shall be carried and for this we are ripening. It
   is to be thought of with ecstatic joy, for the gathering into the barn
   involves a harvest home and I have never heard of men sitting down to
   cry over an earthly harvest home, nor of their following the sheaves
   with tears! No, they clap their hands, they dance for joy and shout
   right lustily! Let us do something like that, concerning those who are
   already housed. With grave, sweet melodies let us sing around their
   tombs. Let us feel that, surely, the bitterness of death is passed.
   When we remember their glory, we may rejoice like the travailing woman
   when her child is born, who "remembers no more the anguish, for joy
   that a man is born into the world." Another soul begins to sing in
   Heaven--why do you weep, O heirs of immortality? Is the eternal
   happiness of the righteous, the birth which comes of their death-pangs?
   Then happy are they who die! Is Glory the end and outcome of that which
   fills our home with mourning? If so, thank God for bereavements! Thank
   God for sad severing! He has promoted our dear ones to the skies! He
   has blessed them beyond all that we could ask or even think! He has
   taken them out of this weary world to lie in His bosom forever! Blessed
   be His name if it were for nothing else but this! Would you keep your
   old father here, full of pain and broken down with feebleness? Would
   you shut him out of Glory? Would you detain your dear wife here with
   all her suffering? Would you hold back your husband from the immortal
   crown? Could you wish your child to descend to earth again from the
   bliss which now surrounds her? No, no! We wish to be going Home
   ourselves, to the heavenly Father's house and its many mansions! But
   concerning the departed, we rejoice before the Lord as with the joy of
   harvest! "Therefore comfort one another with these words."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 13:1-23; 15:13-28; 1 CORINTHIANS
   3:17-23.

   Verses 1, 2. The same day went Jesus out of the house and sat by the
   sea. And great multitudes were gathered together unto Him, so that He
   went into a boat, and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
   He had thus a little breathing space between Him and the people--a
   better opportunity for His being both heard and seen. A noble instance
   of open-air preaching. And if our climate would permit, what a blessing
   it would be if we could turn out of these houses and sit in a boat or
   stand on the seashore!

   3-9. And He spoke many things unto them in parables saying, Behold, a
   sower went forth to sow. And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the
   wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them. Some fell upon stony
   places where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up
   because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they
   were scorched: and because they had no root, they withered away. And
   some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up and choked them; but
   other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an
   hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who has ears to hear, let
   him hear. Upon the very surface of it, this parable teaches those of us
   who have to sow that we must not expect to have our choice of the
   ground--and that we are not even to make a choice of the matter, but we
   are bound to go, as this sower did, and cast a handful there upon the
   hard trodden road and a handful there among the thorns and nettles, and
   a handful here again where there is no deepness of earth and God be
   thanked if a handful shall fall on good ground. Still, for us to
   suppose that we are to sort out the characters and to select the ground
   is a very great mistake! "Go you into all the world and preach the
   Gospel to every creature." A distinction will soon come! The seed will
   be the grand detective of the soil. It will show what the soil is. Just
   as Christ on the Cross is the discerner of men's thoughts, that the
   thoughts of many hearts might be revealed, so is the preaching of
   Christ Crucified the test of human condition! You shall see now who it
   is that has the honest and good ground, and who has not. Not by a
   geological inspection, but simply by throwing a handful of seed on it.
   That will soon discern between the precious and the vile.

   10-16. And the disciples came, and said unto Him, Why do You speak unto
   them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given
   unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it
   is not given. For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have
   more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even
   what he has. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they
   seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do they
   understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which
   says, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing
   you shall see, and shall not perceive: For this people's heart is waxed
   gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have
   closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with
   their ears, and should understand with their hearts and should be
   converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they
   see: and your ears, for they hear A judicial blindness and deafness of
   heart had come over the nation of Israel, so that even when the sun
   shone in its strength in the Person and teaching of Christ, they could
   not see. And when God spoke more plainly than He ever spoke before, by
   His Son, yet they could not hear so as to understand. And I sometimes
   fear that some measure of this judicial blindness has happened unto
   many in our land. Those who take the metaphors of Scripture and
   interpret them literally and dare to take out of the old Law excuses
   for ritualistic observance-- what can we say of them, but that this
   people's hearts have waxed gross? God has done very much for our
   country. He has seeded it with the blood of martyrs. The scars of
   martyrdom have hardly passed away and, after all this, if men will go
   back to the fooleries of popish ceremony--if they will put from them
   the blessed light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ-- depend upon it, God
   will give them up to some kind of hardness of heart, so that they will
   plunge from one superstition to another, and their last end shall be
   worse than the first! But blessed are they who, being taught of God,
   can perceive the spirit beneath the letter, and do not confound the
   emblems which the Savior used, but suck out the meaning from them as
   bees do the honey from the flowers!

   17-19. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
   have desired to see those things which you see and not seen them; and
   to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them. Hear you,
   therefore the parable of the sower When anyone hears the word of the
   Kingdom and understands it not, then comes the Wicked One and catches
   away that which was sown in his heart This is he which received seed by
   the way side. Do you notice here the importance of the Word of God? But
   when it is heard, but not understood, you would suppose that the devil
   might as well let it stay where it was, for what hurt could it do to
   his kingdom for the man to hear it and not to understand it? But he is
   so frightened at the Word of God that he comes, like an evil bird, and
   takes it away for fear lest lying even in the dull heart without
   understanding, yet, somehow, it should breed an understanding in the
   heart! And so he takes it away from the thoughts and the memory, so
   fearful is he of it. "Nothing makes the devil tremble like the Gospel,"
   said Martin Luther, and I do not doubt that all the churches in the
   world, with all their ceremonies, are less feared by the devil than one
   single Doctrine or text out of the Word of God! So he comes, like an
   evil bird, and catches away that which was sown in the heart. You must
   expect to lose a good deal of your teaching. As farmers drop several
   beans in the hole and say, "That one is for the worm; this one is for
   the crow--then there is another which they hope will spring up--so must
   we expect it to be with our teaching--much of which will be lost.

   20, 21. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
   that hears the word, and with joy receives it Yet has he not root in
   himself, but endures for a while: but when tribulation or persecution
   arises, because of the word, by-and-by he is offended. A straw fire
   blazes fiercely, but lasts not long. And so there are some who we hope
   are converts who show an extraordinary zeal, and you would fancy that,
   surely, they would outrun all Christians! But they have not breath.
   They are not good stayers. They soon cease in the race. They are soon
   hot--soon cold. And we may expect to have many disappointments from
   persons of this character, and all the more so among children--readily
   impressed, but easily do they lose the impression.

   22. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that hears the
   word; and the cares of this world, and the deceit-fulness of riches,
   choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.Dear Friends who have to
   teach the young, you have, in their case, less danger in this respect.
   They have not yet come to the time when the cares of this world and the
   deceitful-ness of riches will choke the Word. You have some advantage
   over us, though even the little things of a child's play may make
   nettles and thorns. Things which we could not consider to be
   cares--that seem too trivial--are cares to them. It may be that our
   heavenly Father thinks of our cares very much as we think of our
   children's cares--and as we should smile to see them distrustful, so it
   may be that He smiles and grieves whenever He finds us so. For, mark
   you, even among God's own people, God's Word cannot grow in our hearts
   at the rate it should, for we have the cares of this world and the
   deceitfulness of riches. We must cry to be lifted above
   these--delivered from the evil influences of the world in whichwe
   dwell--or else our good Lord and Master will waste many a handful of
   good seed upon us, though, I trust, that out of us He will get some
   harvest.

   23. But he that received seed into good ground is he that hears the
   word, and understands which also bears fruit, and brings forth, some an
   hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. For all Christians are not alike
   fruitful. Would God they all reached to the hundredfold and went beyond
   it! Such seed, and such a sower, and such fruitful seasons as He has
   given to some of us, and such plowing and such tilling, and such
   feeding, and such watering, and such sunshine, and such dew--oh, we
   ought to bring forth a hundredfold! Let us chide ourselves and whenever
   we have to complain that we do not get a harvest from our sowing, or as
   much as we could desire, let us look within and say, "My heart, you are
   like the field I have to sow. My Master, I fear, gets as little out of
   you as I get when I go unsuccessfully to my work."

   MATTHEW 15:13-15; 21-28.

   13. But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has
   not planted shall be rooted up. He had not any peculiar tenderness
   towards them, they were not plants of his Father's planting--they
   deserved to be rooted up and their teaching was so utterly false that
   if He had offended against it, He was glad to have done so.

   14. Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the
   blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. The bad teacher
   and he that is badly taught, for they are both responsible, shall both
   fall into the ditch. No man can lay the sin of his being misdirected
   entirely upon his priest or his teacher. He had no business to have
   submitted to him. At the same time, it is a very serious responsibility
   for a man who knows not God to attempt to teach the things of God. I
   know a man who, in a certain place of worship was deeply convinced of
   sin--the arrows of God stuck in him and, being in great distress, he
   went to the minister and told him how he felt the burden of his guilt.
   The minister said to him, "My dear Friend, I really had no intention of
   making you uneasy--what was it I said?--I will get the sermon--I am
   very sorry, but really I do not know anything about it." The man said,
   "You told us we must be born-again." "Oh," said the minister, "that was
   done for you when a child--your parents did it." "You know, Sir, we
   must be converted." "Well, really I do not understand it. I am afraid I
   have disturbed you unnecessarily." Our friend, however, was not to be
   put off, so he sought and found the Savior. But how dreadful a thing it
   is when the blind lead the blind--they shall both fall into the ditch!

   15. Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Declare unto us this
   parable. And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding? Do not
   you yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the
   beely, and is eliminated? But those things which proceed out of the
   mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of
   the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
   thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a
   man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man. There is no
   defilement about that. Cleanliness is to be observed, but not the mere
   act of washing just for the sake of it, every time you eat bread, which
   defiles not a man! But oh, what defilement there is in evil thought! In
   anger, which breeds murder! In lust, which leads to adultery and
   fornication! In covetousness which begets theft! And in a false heart
   which leads to false witness, and in a profane mind which leads to
   blasphemy! Oh, that God would cleanse our secret thoughts, the very
   center of our hearts, for until the fountain is made clean, the stream
   that comes from it cannot be pure!

   21, 22. Then Jesus went from there and departed to the coasts of Tyre
   andSidon. And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and
   cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, You Son of David! My
   daughter is grievously vexed with a devil "But He answered her not a
   word." How painful that silence must have been! In what suspense she
   was.

   23. But He answeredher not a word. And His disciples came and besought
   Him, saying, Send her away: for she cries after us. They were mistaken.
   She did not cry after them--she knew better than that! She cried after
   the Lord, after the great Son of David, not after them, but, however,
   she disturbed them.

   24. But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
   the house ofIsraei Christ's personal ministry was confined to the Jews.
   He came as a Savior to redeem all mankind, but as a Preacher, He was a
   minister to the Circumcision and He came to speak only to Israel.

   25. Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!Her prayer
   got shorter and she grew more intense, more energetic, more determined
   to win the blessing. "Lord help me!"

   26-28. But He answered and said, It is not rightt to take thee
   children's bread and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet
   the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Then
   Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it
   unto you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that
   very hour. Oh, can you exercise a like faith in Christ? If so, you
   shall get a like blessing! Only believe in Him! Only make up your mind
   and however great the mercy, it cannot be too great for Him to give!
   And believe that He will give it, rest on Him to bestow it and you
   shall have it! God grant that many may receive it at this very hour!

   1 CORINTHIANS 3:17-23.

   17-18. If any man defiles the Temple of God, him shall God destroy, for
   the Temple of God is holy, which Temple you are. Let no man deceive
   himself If any man amongyou seems to be wise in this world, let him
   become a fool, that he may be wise. Do not let him seek to be reckoned
   wise by the philosophers of the period who are always against the Truth
   of God. Let him consent to be thought to be a fool--yes, let him know
   in his own heart that he is not wise--and then let him yield himself up
   to the wisdom of God. Consciousness of ignorance is the vestibule of
   knowledge! And he that knows right well that he is a fool is on the way
   to becoming a wise man! He that would pass into the Temple of Wisdom
   must first of all confess his ignorance.

   19, 20. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
   written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord
   knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. What a wonderfully
   small difference there is, after all, between the very cultured man,
   who thinks himself so, and the man who makes no pretense to it
   whatever! The knowledge which the wisest man has is about equal, in the
   Presence of God, to the knowledge which one child of three years old
   has over a child of two years old! To God we must all seem masses of
   ignorance! And if you could put the whole British Association, all the
   doctors of divinity, and all the LL.D.'s and all the men of high
   degrees together, the things they did not know would make a great many
   volumes--and the things they didknow would not go very far. "The Lord
   knows the thoughts of the wise that they are vain."

   21. Therefore let no man glory in men. There really is not anything to
   glory in, in men! "The best of men are men at the best." Never need we
   exalt ourselves or extol others. "Lord, what is man that You are
   mindful of him?" "Let no man glory in men."

   21 For all things are yours. Children of God, all men are yours, to
   serve your highest benefit! All ministers and leaders in Christ are
   yours to seek your souls' good! Treat them as bees do flowers, and
   gather honey from them all. "All things are yours."

   22-23, Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
   death, or things present, or things to come-- all are yours. And you
   are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

"Who Is This?"

   (No. 3394)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   19, 1869.

   "When He was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, 'Who
   is this?'" Matthew 21:10.

   THIS was not the first time that question had been asked, or asked
   concerning the same Person. "Who is this?" is a common question in
   reference to our Lord. "Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed
   garments from Bozrah?" "Who is this king of glory?" and so on.
   Doubtless, the angels who are represented as standing on the Mercy Seat
   gazing down upon its golden brightness, desired to look into this very
   question in the olden times, and often said to one another, "Who is
   this?" We hear the Prophet speak of One who is anointed with the oil of
   gladness above His fellows, and is therefore Man, but He is called by
   the same Prophet equal with God, Fellow of the Eternal! How can this
   be? "Who is this?" The subject of the Incarnation of a pure Spirit such
   as God is, in human flesh, must have been staggering even to the
   intellect of seraphs--and again and again they must have said, one to
   another, "Who is this?"

   I can conceive that on that memorable night when the first Christmas
   carol made glad both Heaven and earth, the angels came to Bethlehem's
   manger and looked upon the new-born Child, and said, "Who is this?"
   Knowing that He was the same Person to whom they had been obedient for
   many an age, the ever-glorious Son of God, they must have marvelled to
   find Him an Infant sleeping there where the horned oxen fed, or hanging
   on a woman's breast! And they said to each other, "Who is this?" And I
   can conceive that they followed Him through those 12 years of His
   childhood, or during the years in which He remained in solitude and
   obscurity, unknown to the sons of men, and though they knew Him as the
   Son of Mary, and the reputed Son of Joseph, yet as watchful spirits
   they must have seen the pure beams of Deity in His Character! And so
   the marvelous and supernal excellence of His secret life must often
   have compelled them to ask, one of another, "Who is this?"

   He is in the carpenter's workshop, using the axe and the plane, and yet
   this is He who is to deliver Israel! How is this, and who is this? And
   I can imagine them following Him through the three years of His public
   ministry in the wilderness beholding Him tempted of the devil, though
   Lord of All and Prince and King! When they watched Him in His hunger,
   and cold, and nakedness, and saw Him in His sleepless nights upon the
   bare mountainside--when they beheld Him and strengthened Him in His
   agony and bloody sweat--when they gathered around the Cross, with all
   its terrors, could their eyes have known a tear, they would have wept
   it there and would have said, "Who is this?" When He was buried and
   after three days, rose again from the grave, there must have been
   amazement through all the angelic host! They came, some of them, and
   sat, the one at the head and the other at the foot, where the body of
   Jesus had lain, still wondering much at the great mystery. We can well
   gather that they asked such questions onward through His life, since
   when that life had come to a close, and the issues of it had begun to
   be developed, when our Lord ascended up on high and led captivity
   captive, clothed with Glory--when they came to meet Him, joined in the
   triumphal procession and approached the golden gates--when the songs
   went up, "Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be you lifted up, you
   everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may come in!" there was a
   wonder lingering among the watchers at the portals of Heaven, for they
   said, "Who is the King of Glory?" And again, a second time they said,
   "Who is the Lord of Hosts? Who is the King of Glory?" and they had to
   receive the two answers--they had to be told who He was that was mighty
   in battle and the Lord of Hosts who was the King of Glory! Do they not
   even now marvel, as they cast their crowns upon the glassy sea and
   mingle with the white-robed band--do they not now marvel that such as
   He should be born of a woman, that such as He should be tempted by the
   devil, that such as He should have known poverty, and nakedness, and
   death itself? Thosewounds, those scars still visible, must still be a
   theme for holy admiration and adoring questioning! And as they worship
   Him, recognizing in Him the Wisdom that was with God in the beginning,
   and without whom was not anything made that was made--as they adore Him
   as the Eternal Word, the Preserver as well as the Creator of all
   things--they must still, as they look to His Manhood taken into such
   union with His Godhead, think of Him with holy amazement, with joyous
   astonishment and ask, "Who is this?"

   But we have not to do with the angels at this time! Rather our business
   is with the sons of men. And among them there ought to be more of the
   asking of this question, and there ought to be less. There ought to be
   more of it, the asking in holy wonder! There ought to be less of the
   asking of it in ignorance or in derision. The question, I take it, can
   be asked in both ways. Endeavoring to understand the mystery, he that
   knows it best may still say, "Who is this?" Caring not to know Him, but
   scornfully turning aside from this great mystery of godliness, there
   are tens of thousands who will continue to say, "Who is this? And why
   make this noise about Him, and all this stir and hubbub about the Man
   of Nazareth?" This question is still asked among the sons of men
   because in one sense it ought to be more common, but because in another
   sense it ought never to be raised, I speak upon it tonight. And first
   we shall take--

   I. THE QUESTION AS IT STOOD IN REFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM.

   I suppose there was a pretty common knowledge of our Lord in Jerusalem.
   He spoke openly in the Temple. He was no teacher in secret
   conventicles, hidden away in the dark. He had been seen in their
   streets. His miracles had been the subjects of admiring wonder and
   observation by tens of thousands. They knew who He was. Many of them
   rather delighted to remember His lowly origin. "His brothers, are they
   not all with us?" They knew His mother. They said they knew His father.
   "Is not this the carpenter' s Son?" A knowledge of Christ was pretty
   general. They did not ask the question out of ignorance, but it was
   asked for this reason, among others--by some it was asked because now
   He came under quite a different aspect from that in which He had ever
   appeared before. He never rode, that I know of, upon the land but that
   once. He never rode in anything like pomp or state. He had come into
   Jerusalem and He had gone out of it, a simple private individual,
   claiming no office except that of preacher. But on this occasion He
   comes as a King! Riding in pomp as one who claims to be honored among
   men, and even claims to be King, for He says, "Behold, your King comes,
   meek and lowly." They, therefore, said, "Who is this?" What a change
   has come over the scene!--

   "The lowly Man before His foes, The weary Man and full of woes."

   Does He ride, and ride amidst shouts of popular acclaim, He that did
   not strive, nor cry, nor cause His voice to be heard in the streets?
   He? Does He come in this guise? Therefore greatly struck and amazed by
   the change, they said, "Who is this?" Yes, and we may learn from this
   that when Christ, who is still among the sons of men as the meek and
   lowly Savior, bearing with their bad behavior, and saying, "Come you
   weary, take My yoke and bear it, and you shall find rest"--when He
   comes before long as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the whole
   earth will then cry out, "Who is this?"

   Is this the Man that bled at Calvary? Is this the Man that died praying
   for His enemies? And does He come with a rod of iron in His hand to
   break the nations and dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel? Oh,
   what astonishment will seize the sons of men when they see the King in
   His Glory, whom they would not understand nor serve when He came in the
   meekness and gentleness of love!

   Part of the reason why the people of Jerusalem asked the question was,
   no doubt, this--they were struck with the remarkable enthusiasm with
   which the people received Him. People had been enthusiastic at other
   times, but then it had been immediately after they had been fed with
   the loaves and fishes and, therefore, their enthusiasm was very easily
   accounted for. But on this occasion there had been no feeding with
   loaves and fishes, and yet here He was received by a most enthusiastic
   crowd. They could not, if they had all been sure that He was the very
   Messiah, have received Him outwardly with greater delight. There were
   their garments for Him to sit upon. There were their garments in the
   road to carpet the ground which was thought too coarse for Him to tread
   upon. There were the trees, denuded of their branches, and the palm
   branches borne in front amidst general acclamations of, "Hosanna,
   blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord!" Yes, and the world
   may say whenever it sees an enthusiastic Church, whenever it beholds a
   company of people treating Christ as He ought to be treated, "Who is
   this?" The Church, as we generally see it, never excites any wonderment
   among men. They quite understand what it is--a compact of people who
   have got enough religion to make themselves comfortable and form an
   association for mutual admiration. But a genuine Church is a company
   formed for the admiration of Christ Jesus! A company of people who are
   melted into one because they are all red-hot and flow like streams of
   molten metal into one mold--all united, loving Christ after such a sort
   that they would not merely put their garments in the road, but would
   themselves make a road--who would wish, themselves, that their blood
   could be shed if Christ might be glorious! When the world sees such a
   Church as this, then they begin to cry, one to another, "Who is this?
   Who is this around whom such enthusiasm gathers?" Glory be to God, Your
   day shall yet come to this world when the Church shall wake from her
   slumbers! Then shall she be ashamed of herself, to have treated her
   Bridegroom in such a scurvy manner! When she once loves Him as she
   ought and puts the crown upon His head as she should--then will the
   whole earth say, "Who is this?"

   I have no doubt, also, that part of the question of the people of
   Jerusalem arose from the singular nature of the pomp with which the
   enthusiastic multitude surrounded our Lord. There was a great deal of
   beauty about it, but how very simple it was, how altogether opposed to
   the usual array, to the usual order of pomp! Why, my Brothers and
   Sisters, if you could see the pomp in which great priests--say, at
   Rome--are carried through the streets, with men all clad in liveries,
   with attendants in blue and scarlet, and fine linen and peacocks'
   feathers, and the high elevated throne on which the man is carried who
   claims to be, "His Holiness," you would see how artificial it all is!
   And it is all the same if there is nobody there that cares about it!
   True, some may, but if they did not, it would be all the same. It would
   all be gone through and the admiration that is poured on any of these
   kings and princes--well, it all comes as a matter of course! It is
   natural that we poor worms of the dust should clap our hands when we
   see a king. Of course, it is the bounden duty of such ordinary mortals
   as we are to pay wonderful respect to all those who happen to have a
   peculiar kind of blood in their veins. That is the order of things and,
   as long as people are conventional fools, it always will be! And the
   men of the world will always remain so. We shall always reverence rank,
   whether it has any worthy character about it or not--and priests will
   always like such reverence as that!

   But here was a different style of pomp altogether. Here was a plain,
   common Man, whose garment was merely the smock-frock of an ordinary
   peasant--a garment "without seam, woven from the top throughout"--a Man
   who made no professions to rank, did not separate Himself at all from
   the people! And here they have extemporized for Him a pomp in which
   every jot and tittle is true and real! There was not a shout raised
   here because it was the custom to raise shouts to Jesus of Nazareth.
   There was not a garment strewed in the way because His office required
   Him to be esteemed. It was all genuine, true, real and, mark you,
   Brothers and Sisters, there is no pomp like it!

   What a distinction there is between the honor given to a monarch who is
   beloved, such as we would give to ours-- and the honor that is given to
   a monarch such as the one I spoke ofjust now--who is honored merely
   because he is a monarch, but whom men would honor just as heartily or
   even more heartily if he were gone! Now, the honor given to our Lord
   Jesus Christ was all given because of His Person and the work that He
   had really done in the raising of Lazarus, out of--I will not say true
   spiritual affection, for the multitude did not understand Him in His
   deeper Character, so as to receive Him spiritually--but out of a real
   feeling of reverence for this wonderful Being. There was a natural pomp
   about the whole thing that quite distinguished it from anything that
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem had ever seen before. Some of them might
   have seen a Caesar or a Pompey come home from the wars. Some of them
   might have seen the conquerors and their pageants, and their triumphal
   return into the capital and all the imposing preparations that were
   made that everyone might join in the welcome. They hailed him as Rome's
   greatest man, who trod Rome's enemies beneath his heels. But they had
   never seen anything like this--when the very children in the streets
   took up the cry and said, "Hosannah! Ho-sannah! Blessed is He that
   comes in the name of the Lord." And so they said, "Who is this?"

   Now, mark you, this is always one of the points which should
   distinguish the triumphs of Christ. It is not the victory of
   officialism. It is not the splendor of outward dress, and form, and
   show. There is a real force over men's hearts so that they come to love
   Jesus for what He truthfully is to them. It is not a mock homage which
   they pay, which consists of genuflections and of pompous ceremonies,
   but it is that they exult at the very thought of Him! The heart
   invents, without being taught, its own method of praising Him, seeking
   out and straining after new songs with which to sing unto the Lord who
   has gloriously triumphed! I do believe that the very beauty of the
   Christian religion is its simplicity. And the beauty of the Church of
   God is its having simple worship--all its joys and all its pomp being
   that which comes out of thesimple heart--which has no form, no ceremony
   and needs no directorium, no rule by which to guide it but just does
   what it feels to be the natural expression of that which is felt
   within. And wherever this is, the world cries, "Who is this?"

   Still, there were some in that crowd who did not ask the question for
   that reason at all, but merely that they might say, "Who is this? What
   is He? What's in it? It is all an imposture! He is not the Messiah! He
   comes not in the name of the Lord." They looked down upon the crowd who
   followed Christ, and they said, "It is a vulgar herd--have any of the
   rulers believed in Him? Did the Rabbis follow at His heels? Do the
   Scribes and chief priests accept Him? Who is this?" Well, and this,
   too, is a part of the proof of the true Christ. Wherever He is fully
   preached and His power is known, there is sure to be stirred up a
   company of men who, knowing nothing of the real power of the Gospel,
   will be quite sure to sneer at it! They will say it is only the poor
   who come to it, as though that were not said of old, "The poor have the
   Gospel preached to them." They will say it is only the illiterate, as
   though they had not known that the Apostle Paul, himself, blessed God
   that He "had chosen the foolish things of this world, and things that
   are not, to bring to nothing the things that are." There will always be
   those who, not caring to enjoy, themselves, the blessings of the Great
   Shepherd's reign, will sneer at all those who would. Let us accept
   their sneers as the only tribute they can render to Christ, and as true
   a proof of His excellence and His Glory as the admiration of His
   followers!

   I will not detain you further about the people of Jerusalem, but now
   just observe that--

   II. THIS QUESTION WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED WHENEVER JESUS CHRIST COMES INTO
   ANY PLACE THROUGH THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL.

   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, I am not about to criticize that which is
   called the preaching of the Gospel, so as to condemn it in any
   wholesale way, but I will say this, that wherever the Gospel has been
   preached simply, not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but with the
   plain words of the common tongue. Wherever Christ has been preached
   affectionately. Wherever the whole Gospel has been delivered with
   fervor and with impartiality, it has never failed in any place, or in
   any time, to draw attention to itself, to excite enquiry and to compel
   men to take sides about it, one way or the other! We need never be
   afraid that the Gospel is not suitable to any village, that the
   inhabitants are too degraded. Take it there and they must and shall
   receive it, or else, at their peril shall they reject it! But they will
   hear it! It shall attract them! They shall be found, if not willing
   acceptors of it, yet at least willing hearers of it, willing critics of
   it and that is something! We need not, on the other hand, be afraid to
   take the Gospel among the most enlightened classes. Whatever they may
   know, they know nothing superior to the Word of Jesus Christ--and it
   shall command even their attention. They shall be compelled to examine
   it and if it is not a savor of life unto life to them, still it shall
   be a savor of death--and to God in either case--a sweet savor of Jesus
   Christ! Let us never think that the Gospel needs to be rendered
   attractive by some additions of our own! It is like a sword that cuts
   just as well without the diamonds in the hilt, for the cut of it lies
   not in the handle, but in the sword itself. The Gospel will cut and
   clear its own way. I scarcely think we shall need to come down to the
   use of so-called popular lectures on Sundays. I think we shall never
   need to come down to catchwords for sermons. The Gospel will, after
   all, if it is but drawn out of its scabbard and lifted up as the bare
   and naked sword of the Lord, be pretty sure to cut its own way. And,
   ah, how have we learned in the past, when the Gospel has come to a
   place and it has begun to be the means of the conversion of sinners,
   what a stir it has made! The little village was snug enough in the
   darkness that had gathered around the old tower and there it lay all
   asleep and in the death, but some Methodists came and preached upon the
   Green. A few were converted and gathered into a little room--and what a
   noise there was about it! The squires would put it down. How there were
   threats against those poor cottagers and others! They must lose their
   work--certainly their Christmas gifts--but all that only proved that
   the Gospel still had power, a power, at any rate, to irritate the
   ungodly, which is something, and to bless the simple men and women that
   were willing to receive it!

   Before long we have sometimes seen those very persons who were the most
   determined opponents of the Gospel, sit at its feet! Some of them have
   become its preachers! More and more the Kingdom of Christ has spread
   and grown! From village to village, from town to town the sacred ardor
   has spread! In the days of Whitfield and Wesley the whole nation was
   awakened--as from a long sleep our land started up! Then there were
   found a multitude whom God had chosen, who began to sing glad hymns and
   to chant the praises of God in every town and street! And this land,
   which seemed fast going down in sin and wickedness to the very gates of
   Hell, took a start on the road to Heaven, which, thank God, has never
   been altogether lost, nor shall be, for still will God raise up others
   who will preach Jesus Christ and the leaven shallcontinue to permeate!
   The salt shall still work for Christ among the putrefying mass until He
   comes, who shall end the battle in a glorious victory!

   But I hasten from that to notice that the same wonderful effect in
   another form is produced--

   III. WHEN THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST COMES INTO A SINGLE HEART.

   Do not some of you remember when Jesus Christ first came to your heart?
   Oh, I remember when Moses came into mine, with the Law and the great
   Commandments. When I saw myself a sinner in the light of the Law of
   God! When the fiery light of Sinai made me see my multitude of
   spots--yes, discover that I was covered all over with filthiness and
   blackness! Then the minister came to my gate and I heard the Word
   preached, preached affectionately, too. Then parents taught me the Word
   with tears and prayers, but I got no comfort and my soul continued in
   bondage under a sense of sin. But what a mercy it is when Jesus Christ,
   Himself, comes! When it is no longer the coming of the minister or of
   the preacher, but the coming of Jesus Christ, Himself, when Jesus
   passes by! I know some of you can remember right well the time when He
   passed by you and came into your heart. You believed Him--it was but a
   small action--you believed in Jesus! You gave up all trying to save
   yourselves by your works--you renounced once and for all your reliance
   upon ceremonies, past or future, and you cast yourselves down before
   that Cross whereon the Master shed His atoning blood! You remember
   that. Now, do you not remember what peace there was that came into your
   spirit, a peace that passes all understanding?

   The promises of God could not comfort you until Jesus came with them
   and applied them to your soul. They were full of power when He brought
   them in His hands, but they were nothing until He brought them!

   Do you remember, too, how your doubts and fears all fled? They had been
   hooting in your soul, but when that Light of God shone in, full upon
   you, they soon took to their wings and there was not one of them left!
   You could then rejoice where so lately you had been mourning--and you
   now had songs instead of groans! And do you remember those sinful
   habits of yours which you could not break off? You had struggled
   against them, but you were like a man who is bound fast in iron--you
   could not snap the fetters by any means! You tried, and tried, and
   tried again, but always in vain. But when Jesus came, how free you
   were, how delivered you were! [Here someone shouted, "Hallelujah! Glory
   be to God! Jesus is passing by!"] I wish our friends would not be at
   all troubled with our Brother who simply spoke out of the affection of
   his heart. We are not Methodists and do not quite like it, but when a
   Brother does it, it does not disconcert me and it ought not to trouble
   you! I wish sometimes that there were interruptions like that which
   came at Pentecost, "What must I do to be saved?" I wish sometimes that
   we did feel that we must tell all that Jesus was passing by and was
   entering into our hearts, as our Brother told us just now. Well, you
   remember the moment when Christ came to those bad habits of yours--when
   you had strived against them but could not overcome them--but when He
   came, they dropped off as though they were cloth! Those great ropes of
   sin were snapped and were gone--and you recollect the joy you felt
   within when you could say, "I'm forgiven! I'm, forgiven!"

   Later when you sat down in holy wonder, you could not help it, but the
   tears came fast and thick, one after the other, as you said, "Bless the
   Lord, O my Soul, that ever I was led to receive Christ and to find
   peace in Him!" Oh, Beloved, I know that you said to yourselves, "Who is
   this? What a matchless Christ is this? Who is this that could have
   worked such a wonderful change in me, that could have made my dead
   heart live, could have thawed the iceberg, could have made the mountain
   of snow that is in my soul dissolve, could have brought me up from the
   Valley of the Shadow of Death into the land of light and exceeding
   brightness and glory?" I know you said, "Who is this?"

   And, let me add, your wonder at Christ has not ceased since then! It is
   not long ago since you had sore trouble in business and your heart was
   very heavy. But you got alone with God in prayer and you saw Christ as
   suffering with you, standing in the furnace with you--and how happy and
   quiet your mind was! You could not help saying to yourself, "What
   manner of Man is this that He made me to rejoice, even in tribulation,
   and to be calm in the midst of my afflictions?" You lost a child not
   long ago and you thought your heart would break under that trial, but
   you took the case to Jesus and you were resigned to it, and you said,
   "What manner of Man is this, again, that could so have comforted me?"
   Or it may be you are like some of us watching day by day the slow but
   steady progress of disease in one dear to you as your life. And the
   only comfort you have is by feeling that Jesus Christ being with you,
   it is still easy to bear and to be resigned. And, perhaps, you have
   been slandered for Christ's sake and misrepresented in all you have
   tried to do. But when you have told it to Him, you have said, "I'll
   hail reproach and welcome shame for Jesus' sake." And the calm you have
   had has made you say, "Who is this?" I can only say tonight, though I
   hope I have known my Lord these 21 years, that I do marvel more and
   more at Him, that ever He could do such marvels for me, a poor
   worthless worm. And I think the more you know of yourselves, and the
   deeper you sink in self-abasement, the more will the question rise in
   your soul, "What a glorious Christ must this be! What power there must
   be in His blood! What prevalence in His plea! What tenderness in His
   heart! What might in His arm! What immutability in His Nature, that
   ever He should continue to look down on me and bless me as He does!"
   "Who is this?" your soul will say!

   Now, I must not detain you on that and, therefore, again with great
   brevity, remark that--

   IV. THE TIME IS COMING WHEN THIS QUESTION MAY BE ASKED BY SOME HERE
   WITH GREAT FEAR AND ALARM.

   Unless we ask it now in loving wonder, we shall soon have to ask it in
   most fearful terror! We know not when the time shall be, for times and
   seasons are not committed to us. But it is certain that within a short
   time, Christ will come upon the clouds of Heaven. When the time
   appointed by the Father shall arrive, that very Man who was crucified
   on Calvary, and, who was taken up from among His disciples upon the
   Mount of Olives, shall so come in like manner as He went up to Heaven.

   Now, He went up in Person, and He will come in Person, too, and when He
   comes, it will not be alone, as first He came, but in the Glory of His
   Father and all His holy angels with Him! What astonishment and
   confusion will seize the minds of those who doubted His very existence,
   who denied His Godhead, who stood out against His power! What will the
   Jew say when he looks on Him whom he pierced? What will the Gentile say
   when he looks on Him whom he despised? What will the great men of the
   earth say as they rise from their graves and find themselves so little
   and Him, whom they thought so little, to be so great? What will the
   rich men of the earth say as they find themselves naked and poor as
   beggars and the King, whom they thought nothing of, clothed with the
   Glory of God? Oh, what then will the pleasure-seeker say, who said, "As
   for Christianity, I care not the snap of my finger for it"? What will
   the blasphemer say who even poured contempt and curses upon Christ's
   name? There He sits in majesty that out blazes the sun! There He is
   surrounded by immortals, each one of them shining forth like the sun,
   for so the promise is to all the righteous! There rings the trumpet
   that every ear must hear, and all the dead start up from sea and
   land--a countless multitude! There are the books, they are opened
   amidst a blaze of light and there is the voice that reads out the doom
   of the sons of men! Jesus! Jesus it is, who says, "Depart, you cursed,"
   as well as, "Come, you blessed." Oh, how the multitude will wring their
   hands in amazement when they discover that the Man of Nazareth and the
   Son of Mary is the Everlasting Son of the Father--and those, His
   enemies who would not that He should reign over them, shall be utterly
   destroyed by the Glory of His Presence when He comes in His power! Oh,
   how will the question be asked and how terrible will be the answer,
   "Who is this?" I would rather that you should ask tonight, humbly and
   enquiringly, "Who is this?" And if you do so ask, these few words shall
   tell you and may God tell you to your heart what I can only tell to
   your ears. Who is this? It is Jesus Christ, God over all, blessed
   forever! He so loved the sons of men that He would rather die than they
   should die! He came into the world, took our flesh and became Emmanuel,
   God With Us and, being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself
   and became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross--

   "He bore that we might never bear,

   The Father's righteous ire."

   And whoever trusts in this Man--this God, the appointed Substitute for
   man--shall be saved! But if you trust Him, you must take Him to be your
   Monarch. You must henceforth, by His Grace, yield Him service! And His
   service is pleasure. His service is holiness and holiness shall to you
   be a delight! Oh, that you would, finding that He is such a Savior,
   Divine and Human blended in one--a dying Savior risen from the dead and
   living at the right hand of God--oh, that you would say, "I know who He
   is," and then, "I will accept Him! He shall be mine forever." God grant
   to you the willing mind to do this, and yours shall be the
   blessing--and His shall be the Glory, forever and ever. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 TIMOTHY 2:15-26.

   15. Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needs not
   to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word off truth. This is a metaphor
   taken from the action of the priest at the sacrifice. The priest cut up
   the bullock and then laid it in its different pieces according to
   order. Or, as some think, it is taken from the part of the father at
   the table, when he carves the meat and gives to every child its
   portion. Old Master Trapp said that "there are some ministers who are
   only fit to be Gibeonites--and certainly not to be Levites, for they
   hardly understand the cutting of wood, much less the art of cutting up
   the sacrifice of God." Brothers, it is well so to handle the Word of
   God as to be able to give rebuke when rebuke is needed, exhortation
   when it is needed, and comfort when consolation is required, for
   otherwise we do mischief. As it is said in the old fable of the
   simpleton, that he gave to the ass a bone and to the dog hay, so there
   are some who give wrong exhortations, not because they are wrong in
   themselves, but because they are wrong in their application.

   16, 17. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase
   unto more ungodliness. And their word wiil eat as does a camkei. Now,
   there are some people who can never be content except they make their
   religion a sort of wrangling match. They get hold of a Word in
   Scripture, and away they go with it! Here shall be another opportunity
   for finding fault with all the Church of God. Here shall be another
   occasion for railing against all the preachers of the Truth of God. How
   delighted they are when they can do this! Shun profane and vain
   babblings! Martin Luther said that there were some in his day so nice
   and precise about the letter of Scripture, that when one of them had
   delivered an exposition upon the Book of Job, Luther said that by the
   time the man had got to the 10th Chapter, Job had been a thousand times
   more plagued by the expositors than he had ever been by the losses
   which he suffered upon the dunghill! And doubtless there are many
   Truths of Scripture which are turned to mischief because men will be
   forever making them opportunities for strife--not bonds of love!
   Brothers, hold the five points of the Calvinistic Doctrine, but mind
   you do not hold them as babbling questions! What you have received of
   God, do not learn in order to fight with it, and to make contention and
   strife and to divide the Church of God, and rail against the people of
   the Most High as some do! But on the contrary, love one another as
   Brothers and Sisters, and hold the Truth of God in love, and seek after
   the unity of the Spirit and the perfect bond of charity. The word of
   those who raise these questions will eat as does a cancer, which eats
   till it gets to the bones, and turns the sound flesh into rottenness.
   Oh, there are many contentions which have done this mischief in the
   Church of Christ!

   17-19. Hymenaeus andPhiletus are of this sort. Who concerning the
   truth, have erred, saying that the resurrection is already past; and
   overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God stands
   sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are His. How careful
   the Apostle is lest we should think that any have turned aside, who
   were the Lord's people. He says the faith of some was overthrown, but
   nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure. Oh Brothers and
   Sisters, whenever we see apparent apostasy, let us not therefore think
   that any of God's people have perished! Oh, no, for the Lord knows them
   who are His!

   19-21. And let everyone that names the name of Christ depart from
   iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and
   of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor, and some
   to dishonor If a man, therefore, purges himself from these, he shall be
   a vessel unto honor, sanctified and meet for the Master's use, and
   prepared unto every good work When Mr. Philpot, the martyr, was
   addressing a young man about to die for Christ, he said to him,
   "Brother, you are a vessel in the great house of your Master, and this
   day He will scour you, scour you hard, but remember, you shall soon
   stand upon the shelf, shining bright and glorious." Well, sometimes
   pains and troubles, and tribulations do have this effect of scouring
   the vessels of God to make them bright for Heaven. We must all be
   purged and scoured from sinful lusts, from all the contamination of the
   flesh and of the creature--and then we shall be fit for the Master's
   use!

   22. Flee also youthful lusts. Run away from them! It is no use
   contending with them. Fight with the devil. Resist the devil and make
   him flee, but never fight with the flesh. Run away from that. The only
   way to avoid the lust of the flesh is to stay out of its way. If you
   subject yourself to carnal temptations and fleshly lusts, remember it
   is almost certain that you will be overcome by them!"Flee youthful
   lusts," and as you must keep going and have something after which to
   follow--

   22, 23. But follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that
   call on the Lord out of a pure heart But foolish and unlearned
   questions, avoid, knowing that they do cause strifes. It is generally a
   good thing to avoid all questions that breed strife, unless they are
   upon vital and important matters. For, oh, Brothers and Sisters, it is
   so important tokeep the unity of the Spirit! It is such a blessed thing
   to preserve love among Christians and there are some who in order to
   create disunion, go about the land and tear and rend the body of Christ
   as much as they can! Beware of such! Seek not their company! Come not
   near them, lest their cancer pollute you also!

   24-26. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
   all men, apt to teach, patient In meekness instructing those who are in
   opposition, if God, perhaps, will give them repentance to the
   acknowledging of the truth. And that they may recover themselves out of
   the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him to do his will We
   have here laid down, then, the duty of the Christian minister and the
   duty of each Christian, too! And let us seek, in the Holy Spirit' s
   Grace, to carry it out, being at once firm, and gentle, and loving of
   heart, and yet honest for the Truth of God as it is in Jesus.

The Savior's Precious Blood

   (No. 3395)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Theprecious blood of Christ." 1 Peter 1:19.

   We have come in our theological conversation to use that word, "blood,"
   somewhat lightly. I think it should scarcely ever be pronounced without
   a shudder. "The blood is the life thereof." When shed, it indicates
   suffering--suffering more intense than that of chastisement or
   bruising. Wounds are inflicted which make the lifeblood to flow out. In
   the case of our Lord, Jesus Christ, the term, "blood," brings before us
   all His griefs and anguish and where the crown of thorns pierced Him.
   Behold the Man! Think of Gethsemane, where He sweat, as it were, great
   drops of blood falling to the ground! Think of Gabbatha, the pavement,
   where they scourged Him with rods, and with the scourge of the Roman
   lictors where the crown of thorns pierced Him. Behold the Man! Think,
   lastly, of Golgotha! There they pierced His hands and His feet and, at
   last, pierced by the spear, out of His side there came blood and water.
   Pass not lightly, therefore, over such a word as this--blood--the blood
   of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son! And when you read of its being
   "precious," remember that the word never had such a wealth of meaning
   in it, before, in any of its applications. Precious metals--gold and
   silver. Precious stones--sardonyx, agate and diamond--these are but
   gaudy toys compared with Christ's precious blood! Precious, for He is
   God as well as Man. Precious, for He is Jehovah's Darling, the Lamb of
   God, without spot or blemish! Precious, when you think of God's design.
   Precious, when you see the effects which it produces. Precious,
   certainly, to the heart of every pardoned sinner and precious in the
   song of every glorified spirit before the Throne of God!

   It is not, however, my objective, this evening, to pursue the sacred
   history, so much as to set forth the saving Doctrine, while I remind
   you of some of the uses of this precious blood. For, after all, the
   standard of preciousness, when we come to the very essence of it, is
   not scarcity, but usefulness, for there are things in this world
   exceedingly scarce and, therefore, precious among the sons of men,
   which will be left out and treated with contempt when we get into the
   land where the true standards of value are in use. That is the most
   precious which is the most serviceable. So in truth, the precious blood
   of Christ is beyond all estimation! I want to conduct you, step by
   step, through the application of this blood and its effects upon the
   heart and conscience. And I shall pause at each step to ask you, dear
   Hearer, and to ask myself this question--Do you know the blood, the
   precious blood, in this respect? Have you felt it in this peculiar form
   of its efficacy? Beginning thus at the first--

   I. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE BLOOD OF THE ATONEMENT.

   We read of the blood of the Atonement under the old Law. Christ, now
   under the Gospel, is the Propitiation for our sins. It is through the
   blood that God, infinitely just, without the violation of His
   Character, can pass by the transgression of the guilty. It is not
   possible that any one attribute of God should ever shadow another. He
   is perfect. He is infinitely merciful, but He will not be merciful at
   the expense of justice! Justice shall never triumph against mercy!
   Mercy, on the other hand, shall never cut off the skirts of the flowing
   robe of justice. It is in the Person of Jesus and especially in the
   blood of Jesus, that the great riddle of the ages is solved! God can be
   just and yet the Justifier of him that believes in Jesus. We have
   sinned. God must punish sin. According to the inexorable laws which God
   has stamped upon the universe, the sinner cannot go unpunished. His sin
   is, in fact, its own punishment and becomes the mother of unnumbered
   griefs. The Mediator steps in--the Son of God and the Son of Man,
   eternal, and yet as Man, born of Mary and slumbering in Bethlehem' s
   manger--He comes as the Substitute for the guilty. "The chastisement of
   our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed." And "now in
   Christ Jesus, we who some time were afar off, are made near by the
   blood of Christ." God can be gracious without the violation of the
   severity of His judgment. His moral government remains untarnished in
   all the majesty of its purity, and yet He puts out the right hand of
   reconciliation and love to all who approach Him making mention of the
   blood of the Atonement of His dear Son!

   Are you, then, thus reconciled to God by the death of His Son, or are
   you still an enemy? Have you ever seen the distance between you and God
   bridged by the Cross? Have you seen at once how God, the infinitely
   Just, can commune with you without consuming you, because He poured His
   wrath upon Christ, instead of you? And then, accepted in Him and for
   His merits, you live because Jesus lives! Ah, dear Hearer, if you have
   not seen this, may the Lord open those blind eyes of yours and by His
   eternal Spirit bring you, with your burden of sin upon your back, to
   the foot of the Master's Cross, where you may look up and sing--

   "Oh, how sweet to view the flowing,

   Of His sin-atoning blood!

   With Divine assurance knowing,

   That it made my peace with God." The blood of Jesus Christ has another
   effect upon us, namely--

   II. IT CLEANSES FROM SIN.

   Surely we can never fail to remember that choicest of all Scriptural
   texts, "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin."
   There is such music in it that when the spirits before the Throne of
   God desire to have a song of which they might never grow weary, they
   select that sentiment, and they sing before the Throne that they have
   washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Their
   purity before God is due to the fountain filled with blood wherein
   their stained garments, all soiled with sin, have been made clean! When
   the soul comes to Jesus Christ by faith and relies upon Him, then the
   sentence of the perfect pardon goes forth from God and the soul is
   purged from all the stains of accumulated years! In a single moment
   those who were black as Hell become white as Heaven through the
   application of the blood of sprinkling--for all sin disappears as soon
   as the blood falls on the conscience! That which the blood of bulls and
   of goats could not do, the blood of Jesus effectually
   accomplishes--cleansing from all sin!

   Now, dear Hearer, have you ever been thus cleansed? Say not you had
   never need of cleansing, else you know not your natural condition and
   your actual transgressions. Man, you can never have seen yourself in
   the mirror of the Word of God, or you would perceive yourself to be
   totally defiled and altogether as an unclean thing! You would have
   bowed yourself before the Lord and joined in the confession, "We have
   erred and strayed from Your ways like lost sheep. We have done those
   things which we ought not to have done, and we have left undone those
   things which we ought to have done. And there is no health in us."
   Well, if you have ever thus felt your guilt, have you ever realized
   your pardon? If not, give yourself no sleep till you have! Can you bear
   to live unpardoned, or in doubt whether or not God has absolved you?
   Can you ever take any kind of rest, much less indulge your soul with
   mirth, until the word, "Absolvo," has come from God, Himself, the
   eternal Spirit bearing witness with your spirit that you are born of
   God? Happy are they who have been washed! They have need to come each
   night (even as Peter the Apostle had need) to wash their feet, but they
   need not except to wash their feet, for they are clean every whit.
   Jesus has made them clean through His blood! The third step is that--

   III. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE GREAT PRICE OF OUR REDEMPTION.

   Redemption sometimes in Scripture is spoken of as being the same thing
   as pardon, and I shall not at all dogmatically attempt tonight to draw
   any nice distinction between the two. "We have redemption through His
   blood--to wit, the forgiveness of sin--according to the riches of His
   Grace." But redemption seems rather to be in some sense the effect
   produced by a pardon than the actual pardon, itself. Man is a slave. As
   long as guilt is written in God's book against us, we are in bondage.
   We feel for the present that we are slaves to sin and that for the
   future, the punishment of sin will inevitably come upon us to our
   eternal destruction. But the moment we are purged from the guilt of
   sin, we are set free from the slavery of it! Jesus Christ takes us from
   being slaves and makes us to be children! He gives us no longer "the
   spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption whereby we
   cry, Abba, Father!" He was slain and He has redeemed us unto God by His
   blood! And in the liberty wherewith Christ makes us free, we rejoice to
   see that it was the blood which was the price, thereof, and because He
   suffered, therefore our chains have dropped off from us. We
   arefree--the Lord' s freemen--free henceforth to serve Him with renewed
   love and renewed hearts because of the abundance of the Grace which He
   has manifested towards us!

   Now, Beloved, have you ever been redeemed by the blood of Jesus? I am
   not talking to you now about a redemption effected upon the Cross, but
   have you ever felt redemption in your own spirit from the curse of the
   Law, from the thrall-dom of a guilty conscience and from the power of
   sin? Let me ask you, are you the Lord's freeman tonight? Oh, happy are
   you, then, for you can say, "Lord, You have loosed my bonds and,
   therefore, I am Your servant." "We are not our own because we are
   bought with a price." And inasmuch as we are no more slaves to the Law
   from henceforth, for the love we bear His name who has redeemed us with
   such a price, we reckon ourselves to be His servants and we bear in our
   body the marks of the Lord Jesus! Ah, Friends, if you were never
   redeemed by the precious blood, then you are still slaves--slaves to
   sin and Satan--slaves under the vengeance of God and slaves to the Law
   of God. But may you never be content in slavery! May you pine after
   freedom, and may Jesus give it to you--give it to you tonight if it is
   His blessed will! In the fourth place, the blood of Jesus is spoken of
   in Scripture as--

   IV. INTERCEDING.

   "The blood of sprinkling speaks better things than that of Abel." It is
   said to be sprinkled within the veil, so that where the high priest
   could only go once a year, we may now go at all times, for the blood is
   there, interceding for us perpetually! Well, in fact, says one of our
   poets--

   "The wounds of Christ for us,

   Incessantly do plead."

   Even after His death, remember, His heart for us poured out its flood.
   After death that heart was pierced and blood and water came. So, after
   His voice was silent and He could no longer say, "Father, forgive
   them," the wounds were still elo-quent--and even when the suffering
   passed, they still continued to plead with God.

   Now, Soul, have you ever come to God through the intercession of the
   blood? You have said prayers, you have repeated forms of devotion, you
   have gone to Church or to Meeting Houses. This is all well enough, but
   have you gone farther? For if not, all outward forms of devotion are
   but frivolous endeavors that may allure, but will deceive you! Did you
   ever come to God by the blood and did you ever, by faith, fix your eye
   upon "the High Priest who ever lives to make intercession for us," who
   with our names upon His bosom, still offering the blood, stands at this
   moment before the Father, God, pleading for us who love Him and trust
   Him? Happy they who look to the interceding Savior and who feel that
   His blood speaks not revenge, but cries at every vein, "Mercy, mercy
   for the chief of sinners!" This leads me to remark that the blood of
   Jesus--

   V. BECOMES THE MODE AND WAY OF ACCESS TO GOD.

   We have boldness to enter into the holiest through the blood of Christ.
   After first cleansing the man and making him fit to come as a priest
   and a king unto God, then the blood, as it were, takes away the veil
   and opens up the pathway to God, Himself, for the forgiven and redeemed
   soul! Never let us attempt to come to God by anything but the blood!
   All other ways to God, except through the blood of Jesus, are
   presumptuous. All other fire that we may put upon the altar, except
   this, is strange fire, and the Lord's anger will go forth against us.
   May I never plead when on my knees before God anything but the precious
   merits and the dear wounds of the Man of Sorrows who is now exalted at
   the right hand of God. How close to God we should come if we did but
   always bring Christ with us! But what are our prayers when we leave Him
   behind? What are our devotions when we are met together, or when we are
   in secret, and we go to the Mercy Seat, but forget the blood that was
   sprinkled on it, oblivious of the new and living way through the rent
   body of Imma-nuel? Come, Brothers and Sisters, let us chide ourselves
   for sometimes having forgotten our Lord! And henceforth, be it ours
   never to think of drawing near to God except by this way of access--the
   crimson road which the blood has paved for us! To advance farther, the
   blood of Jesus Christ, according to the Word, is--

   VI. SANCTIFYING.

   Jesus sanctified His people by His own blood and, therefore, suffered
   outside the gate. By sanctification is usually meant in Scripture the
   setting apart of anything for the service of God and so making it holy.
   Now, the blood separates the saints from all others. It was the blood
   that was the distinguishing mark of Israel in Egypt. Every Egyptian
   house was without the blood, but every house of the seed of Abraham had
   the blood mark upon the lintel and the two side posts, and when God saw
   the blood He passed over them and spared them in the night of His
   furious anger. The blood, then, Beloved, if you have ever had it on
   your soul, is to be the distinguishing mark between you and the ungodly
   in the Day of Wrath and it should distinguish you now. You should, by
   your life and your conversation, make yourself to appear to be as the
   blood has made you--to really be a separated one! We are not of the
   world, even as Christ is not of the world. We have heard the
   mandate--"Come you out from among them; be you separate; touch not the
   unclean thing." We have left the world's sin and we have left the
   world's religion, too! We have separated ourselves at once from the
   world's goodness, as well as from the world's vileness, to walk in the
   path of nonconformity to the world, that we may tread in the footsteps
   of our crucified Redeemer! And the more the blood is applied, the more
   the obedience of Jesus is trusted in-- and the sprinkling of the blood
   is relied upon--the more shall we become sanctified in spirit, soul and
   body by the power of the Holy Spirit. Let us never forget the purifying
   power of Jesus in the heart. Wherever He is trusted to take away the
   guiltof sin, we must next seek the water which flowed with the blood to
   take away the powerof sin! And we must ask to see Him sit as a refiner
   to purify, yes, it must be our prayer that He would take His fan in His
   hand and purge our hearts as He does His floor! Refining Fire, go
   through my soul! Oh, sweet love of Jesus, burn up the love of the
   world! Oh, death of Jesus, be the death of sin! Oh, life of Christ, be
   the life of everything that is gracious, God-like, heavenly, eternal!
   So shall it be in proportion as we partake of the power and the
   efficacy of that blood! The blood, furthermore, is--

   VII. CONFIRMATORY.

   We must not forget this one effect of it. It is called the Blood of the
   Covenant--the Blood of the Testament--the Blood of the New Testament.
   The Covenant was not in force in the olden times until there had been a
   sacrifice to confirm it. And a will stands not until the death of the
   testator has been proved to make it valid. The heart's blood of Jesus
   is, as it were, the establishment of His last will and testament.
   Jesus, the great Testator, has died, has made an end of sin and His
   blood is the great seal of His testament and makes it valid to us. If
   He had never died! Oh, dreadful, "if," only equaled in horror by that
   other, "if"--if He had never risen again from the dead! But now is
   Christ risen from the dead! Now has Christ slept and awoke as the first
   fruits of them that slept! Never doubt the promise of God, for the
   blood confirms it! Never doubt the love of God, for He spared not His
   own Son, but freely delivered Him up for us all! How shall He not, with
   Him, also freely give us all things? If you need evidence as to the
   eternal goodness of God, His willingness to pardon, His power to save
   and to bless--look to the Cross of Calvary and see the bleeding
   Savior--and never doubt again!

   Dear Hearer, did the blood so come to you as to confirm your hope, or
   is your hope a fancy, a delusion? Do you think it needs no
   confirmation? Have you ever in your moments of questioning and anxiety
   gone over, again, to the altar where is the Great Victim? Have you said
   once more--

   "Just as I am, without one plea,

   But that Your blood was shed for me!

   And that You bid me come to Thee,

   Oh, Lamb of God, I come!"

   Have you, then, got your consolation back? Have you received the
   witness of God? Have you heard the voice which bears witness both in
   Heaven and earth, the voice of the Spirit, and the water and the blood?
   And have you been satisfied because you needed no better confirmation
   than the witness of the blood of Jesus applied with power to your soul?
   The blood of Jesus has another effect of which we ought to think more
   than we do--that of--

   VIII. NOURISHING, CHEERING AND SUSTAINING THE BELIEVER.

   To this end the ordinance of communion with Christ in the breaking of
   bread and partaking of the cup of blessing has been instituted. When we
   come to the Lord's Table, we have set before us in the broken bread, of
   which we eat, and in the wine of which we drink, this present
   fact--that the sufferings of our Master are now at this moment for our
   nourishment, sustenance, consolation and exhilaration. We have been
   washed in the blood--we are now to receive, after a spiritual sort, the
   precious blood of Jesus to nourish our faith, to comfort our hope, to
   excite in us the liveliest joy and to make us sing and be merry with
   holy confidence in Him who has redeemed us from all iniquity and made
   us unto God priests and kings, to reign with Christ forever and ever!
   There is no cordial for the heart like the blood of Jesus. To think of
   the atoning Sacrifice is the readiest way to consolation. Our sorrows
   are not worth a thought when once compared with His! Sit down under the
   shadow of the Cross and you will find a cooler shade than that of a
   great rock in a weary land. There is no pasturage for the sheep of
   Christ like that which grows on Calvary! There is nowhere to be found
   suchwine that makes glad the heart of God and man, as that which comes
   from the sacred cup of His heart, of which Believers drink by faith
   when they have fellowship with Him and come into near and dear
   communion with Him! Although we do sometimes enjoy this without any
   emblems--without the bread and without the wine--these are still great
   assistants, blessed exponents, and they graciously help our
   forgetfulness! We are yet in the body and we need something that shall
   aid this lagging flesh to see something of the Lord.

   Oh, feed then on Christ and do not be content unless day by day He is
   your daily bread! He who has given you life must sustain that life. He
   who has taught you how to rejoice must still supply you with power to
   continue in your daily rejoicing! The blood without cleanses. The blood
   within cheers, yes, sacredly inebriates the soul till the sinner drinks
   and forgets his sorrow and remembers his misery no more! And in the
   fullness of his delight he becomes sweetly oblivious, whether in the
   body or out of the body, as he rises into almost celestial communion
   with his unseen, but ever-present Lord! Once again, the blood of Jesus
   Christ has the effect of--

   IX. UNITING CHRISTIANS TOGETHER.

   Paul, speaking of Jew and Gentile, says that He "has made both one,
   through the blood of Christ," and surely there is nothing that unites
   different denominations of Christians together like the precious blood
   of Jesus! Brothers and Sisters, we may dispute--I think we do well to
   dispute over important ordinances and doctrines, for wherein men err we
   are not to wink at their errors--and neither ask them to wink at ours.
   I have sometimes heard it said, "Spare such a Brother." Yes, as a
   Brother--but who am I that I should be spared if I err, or who is he
   that he should be spared? What are we, or what are our feelings
   compared with the Truth of God? No, let questions be fought out as
   kindly, as lovingly, as valo-rously, as honorably as they possibly can!
   Truth fears not the shock of arms. Let the controversies go on. I
   believe that, after all, there is ten times more Truth in this world,
   now, with all the apparent divisions of Christians, than there would
   have been if we had been united in a nominal union into some one great
   church which might, perhaps, have rotted as thoroughly as the old
   Church of Rome did before the days of Luther! But when we come to the
   foot of the Cross, what union there is! If the saints in prayer appear
   as one. If in the praise of the Infinite Jehovah they are one--much
   more and much more tenderly are they one when they behold Jesus
   bleeding and dying for them! My heart melts and breaks when I hear
   Christ preached. He who lifted up Christ would have offended me had he
   preached some other part of his creed. Had he talked over some Doctrine
   which I hold to be erroneous, he and I had differed, but when it comes
   to this, "HE loved me and gave Himself for me--He is the chief among
   ten thousand, the altogether lovely--His blood is precious"--I feel
   inclined to cry, "Brother, keep to that! Praise Him louder! Give Him
   all the honor!--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all!"

   While we keep to that, we are none of us heretics over that! There
   shall be no schisms and divisions over the matter. Son of God and Son
   of Man, Redeemer of our souls from death and misery, all Your mother's
   children praise You! Every sheaf bows before Your sheaf! Sun and moon,
   and every star do obeisance unto You, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
   Head over all things unto your Church, which is Your dwelling place,
   the fullness of Him that fills all in all! Since here we are one, when
   we get together as Believers, I wish we more often struck that key--the
   precious blood of Christ--and in our walks and talks with those
   Christians who differ from us in many points, let us sometimes try to
   turn those points aside and say, "We do agree to speak well of that
   dear name which is above every name, that name which charms all our
   fears and bids all our sorrows cease! That name which is the joy of the
   Believer on earth and the bliss of the saints in Heaven! I close now
   when I have noticed that the blood of Jesus Christ may be looked upon
   by us every day as--

   X. THE GREAT INSTRUCTOR AND THE CARDINAL WITNESS OF DIVINE TRUTH.

   God is to be seen in Nature and seen vividly there, but not as He is to
   be seen in Christ Jesus. Instruction as to the eternal power of the
   Godhead, some find in the skies above, in the fields around and in the
   sea beneath. But in the Cross there is more of God than in all the
   world besides! I have often felt, when I have been rambling in the
   Alps, that Nature was too small to set forth God. The mirror is not
   large enough to reflect the face of the Eternal. You stand in the Alps
   and hear the avalanche, like claps and peals of thunder resounding in
   the air. You gaze afar off and there it is, and it looks to you like
   the falling of a few flakes of snow. It is so inconsiderable that the
   grandeur seems to be destroyed. Though every one of those flakes may be
   a block of ice weighing a hundred tons, at such a distance the thing
   grows small. The water leaps down hundreds of feet from the crags, but
   up in the mountains it appears to be a little trickling creek scarcely
   worth notice. The very Alpine summits seem to dwindle down to small
   heaps of stones when one grows used to the scenery. God is too great
   for this earth to bear Him. The axles of this world's chariot would
   snap beneath the weight of Deity. We talk of going from Nature up to
   Nature's God, but the top of the highest Alps is far below His
   footstool! We do not get any conceptions of God out of Nature worthy of
   His august Majesty. But in contemplating the Cross, in discerning,
   there, how God can forgive, how willing He is to save the guilty, how
   His justice is magnified at the same time as His Grace, I am persuaded
   that those who have tried both forms of contemplation will tell you
   that this last is the better by far! You see God through the wounds of
   Christ as through windows of agate and gates of carbuncle--and you cry,
   "My Lord, and my God!"

   In winding up this poor discourse of mine, let me say to you, Beloved,
   be more in meditation upon Jesus. I say to myself--Preacher, preach
   your Master more! Preach Him more after His own sort and endeavor to be
   yourself more like He! Dear Hearer, live nearer to the Cross. With all
   your study of Doctrine--and you do well to study it thoroughly-- make
   Jesus Christ the first. Believe in Him. Let Him be your creed. Speak of
   a body of divinity--there never was in this world but one body of
   divinity and that is Jesus Christ! And he that understands Jesus Christ
   has got the only system of theology that is worth knowing! Get right
   into Him. Some of the early Fathers used to study every wound. They
   would write a treatise on almost every different spot where He was
   scourged! They had some tears to let fall and some sweet songs to sing
   for every step along the Via Dolorosa. Let us not treat lightly what
   those nearer to the Light of God treated so solemnly, but regarding the
   Master and thinking much of even the littles that concern Him (for the
   leaves of this Tree of Life are for the healing of the nations), let us
   study to understand Him and ask to be conformed to Him-- even in His
   sufferings to be like He--and when we suffer, to see Him in our pangs!
   Let every grief be a glass through which to look into His life and
   love, and understand His Grace.

   I wish you all knew this, and more than this. Oh, that I could hope
   that all this assembled company did trust in my Master! Poor Sinner,
   why not trust Him? You will never be saved unless you do! There is no
   other door of mercy for you than Jesus! Come, come, come, even though
   you think He will cast you away. If Christ had a drawn sword in His
   hand, yet I would bid you come! It were better to fall on the point of
   His sword than to live without Him! Come and rest upon Him. He never
   rejected a sinner yet, and He never can! The vilest of the vile can
   find mercy in Him! And all He asks--and that He gives--is that you rely
   on Him with all your heart and you shall be saved! God grant that you
   may! "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." Obey the second
   precept as you have attained to the first. When you have believed in
   Christ crucified, dead and buried for you, then be dead and buried with
   Him in Baptism! Take the outward symbol of His death, burial and
   resurrection, and ask to have the inward spiritual Grace that you,
   being dead to the world, and dead with Christ, and buried with Him, may
   rise again to newness of life through His quickening Spirit.

   The Lord thus bless you, for Jesus' sake!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 1:1-16; MATTHEW10:37-40.

   Verses 1, 2. Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers
   scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia.
   Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
   sanctifcation of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
   of Jesus Christ Grace unto you, and peace be multiplied. The first
   Christians were not so afraid of the Doctrine of Election as some are
   now-a-days. Peter was not ashamed to address the saints as the elect of
   God, for so, indeed, they are, if they are saints at all. It is He that
   chose them, not because they were sanctified, but that they might
   besanctified--chose them to eternal life through sanctification. Oh,
   happy are they who, by Divine Grace have made their calling and
   election sure, and now ascribe all the glory of their salvation to the
   Sovereign choice of God! "Grace unto you, and peace be multiplied."

   3-5. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who,
   according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. To an
   inheritance, incorruptible and unde-filed, and that fades not away,
   reserved in Heaven for you. Who are kept by the power of God through
   faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time. How full
   of Grace every sentence is! He blesses God because God has so freely
   blessed us! And he abounds in thanksgiving because he sees that
   abundant mercy by which Believers have been
   begottenagain--born-again--made, therefore, children after a new sort
   and so made heirs of an inheritance very different from that upon which
   we enter by nature--"an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and
   that fades not away." Brothers and Sisters, if you have, indeed, been
   born by Divine Grace, to what estates are you born--to what high
   dignities and sacred privileges! Rejoice and bless the Lord! But,
   perhaps the dark fear crossed your mind that, perhaps, after all, you
   may perish and miss the inheritance. Now notice the double consolation
   of a double keeping. The inheritance is kept. It is reserved in Heaven
   for you and you are kept, too. It is kept for you and you are kept for
   it, "For you, who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto
   salvation."

   6. Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
   you are in heaviness through manifold temptations. This is your life.
   This is like a rainbow made up of the drops of earth's sorrow in the
   beams of Heaven's love--a happy combination, after all.

   7. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than gold
   that perishes, though it is tried with fire, might be found unto praise
   and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ Gilt looks very
   much like gold but it will not stand the fire. It curls and disappears.
   Oh, to be solid gold through and through! If so, you need not mind the
   trials of today, since they will only prepare you for the eternal
   glories at the appearing of Jesus Christ!

   8-10 Whom having not seen, you love in whom, though now you see Him
   not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory--receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
   souls. Of which salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched
   diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you.
   Prophets knew about you. They did not taste of the Grace you know, but
   through the vista of the future they foresaw it and they almost envied
   you in this Gospel dispensation that you should live in so clear a
   light and should be fed upon such rare mercies. Oh, what Prophets and
   kings longed for, do not let us despise! And we shall despise these
   mercies if we do not make the most of them by entering into the
   fullness of the joy which they are meant to bring to us. These Prophets
   searched diligently.

   11-12. Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ who
   was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
   Christ and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed that
   not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are
   now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you,
   with the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven; which things the angels
   desire to look into. See you not your privilege, then? You have what
   Prophets had not! You enjoy what angels desire to see! They cannot
   enjoy what you do. Rightly does our hymn put it--

   "Never did angels taste above, Redeeming Grace and dying love."

   And you have, this very day!

   13. Therefore gird up the loins of your mind. Be ready to depart to
   your inheritance. Do not let your garments flow carelessly and loosely,
   as though you had no journey before you, but, "gird up the loins of
   your mind."

   13. Be sober, and hope to the end for the Grace that is to be brought
   unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. That is a very blessed
   subject. There is a Grace that was brought to you when Christ first
   came. There is another Grace and a higher Grace that is to be brought
   to you when Christ shall come the second time! Until that Second Coming
   of Christ, the Church on earth and in Heaven cannot be perfected. The
   bodies of the saints wait in the grave till He comes to give them
   resurrection--

   "O long expected day, begin!

   Dawn on these realms of woe and sin."

   For we wait for Your appearing, O Christ!

   14-16. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the
   former lusts in your ignorance, but as He which has called you is holy,
   so be you holy in all manner of conversation: Because it its written.
   Be you holy, for I am hol. See your Model. See the Copy to which you
   are to write. You are far short of it. Try again. May the power of
   Jesus rest upon you and may He who has worked us to the same thing to
   which we have attained continue to work in us till we are like our Lord
   Himself!

   MATTHEW10:37-40.

   Verse 37. He that loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of
   Me: and he that loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
   What a wonderful sight, then, the Church is, as it passes through this
   world. The Head of it is Christ, the Cross bearer, and following in the
   train are all His faithful disciples, all carrying crosses still--the
   very picture of a Church. You know how Simon carried the Cross after
   Christ--he is the type of all His disciples--

   "Did Simon bear the Cross alone,

   And all the rest go free?

   No, there's a cross for everyone,

   And there's a cross for me."

   38, 39. And he that takes not his cross and follows after Me, is not
   worthy of Me. He that finds his life shall lose it and he that loses
   his life for My sake shall find it You gain life by dying for Christ,
   but if you saved life by denying the faith you would in the worst sense
   lose all that makes existence to be life! There is an existence which
   is nothing but eternal death--and this is the doom of those who depart
   from Christ. But blessed are they who can give up this temporary mortal
   life for the sake of an eternal one! I have heard of one who used to
   often boast of what he would do if it came to his being burnt--but just
   before the day on which he was to be burnt alive for the faith, he
   recanted. He was allowed to go home. In a few months it happened that
   he was burnt alive in his house. Unhappy man that could not burn for
   Christ, but had to burn after all! "He that finds his life shall lose
   it: and he that loses his life for My sake shall find it."

   40. He that receives you receives Me, and he that receives Me receives
   Him who sent MM. Think of that, you that have received Christ! You have
   received God, Himself, and He has come to dwell and reign with your
   soul!

Experiencing Confirming Testimony

   (No. 3396)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 27,
   1869.

   "As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of Hosts, in
   the city of our God." Psalm 48:8.

   "As we have heard, so have we seen." This is not always the case, but
   frequently it is the very reverse. Things are exaggerated. The
   imagination is largely drawn upon and we hear great things, but when we
   come to look at them, or try to practically enjoy them, the great
   things have become very small! It is so in the world generally. We have
   heard and were told in our youthful days by those who have been before
   us, that the paths of sin are pleasant, that there are great enjoyments
   to be found in the indulgences of evil passions, and that if we will
   give ourselves up to the general run and current, we shall find
   ourselves very smoothly floating along on a stream of happiness! Ah,
   how many who have sown their wild oats and looked for a happy harvest,
   have discovered that nothing but mischief comes of this! Jaded by the
   satiety of their lusts, and at last utterly destroyed by their own
   wickedness, they have sat down and wrung their hands in despair at
   finding out that things are not what they heard they were. As they have
   heard, so do they not see, but the very opposite--for pleasure, pain,
   for happiness, misery--even here, remorse--and afterwards an anguish
   that shall know no end!

   Nor is it any better with the teachers of false doctrine. As we have
   heard, so have we not seen. We have sometimes been told that philosophy
   will civilize a nation--that the spread of education will most
   certainly cure the human heart and that the bias and propensity to sin
   will be put down by an increase of mental light. But as we have heard,
   so have we not seen, for philosophy has thrown many burdens upon
   men--but it has not touched those burdens to remove them with so much
   as its little finger! We hear a great deal of what is to be done for
   society by this scheme and by that, but nothing is done! Theories are
   propounded--windbags are blown out and brought forth--bubbles are
   blown, but we do not see much that is solid and valuable, produced! One
   after another of these eminent theorizers have arisen who were about to
   revolutionize and reconstruct society! Instead of making the causes of
   evil in the world to increase, they were to uproot them and turn the
   desert into the Garden of the Lord! But so it has not been--our eyes
   have never seen it. Rather has the bad been made worse and the good has
   been impeded by those who were so pretentious and loud in their
   professed benevolence! Take any of the false doctrines which are often
   affiliated to our holy faith and you will find that when you come to
   examine them and put them to the test, they do not hold water!

   How often have we heard about "the dignity of human nature." How
   congenial the heart of man is to that which is noble, and to that which
   is Christ-like! We are told that we have only to hold up Christ and
   there is such a beauty in Him that all the world will be sure to love
   Him! But as we have heard, so have we not seen, but we have seen men to
   be as God saw them--corrupt! There is none that does good, no, not one,
   and in the perfect light of Calvary, we have seen that even the
   perfections of Jesus will not be seen by a blind world, nor will they
   attract a corrupt world. "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" will be the
   verdict of humanity even upon the perfections of the Incarnate God. We
   have heard a great deal about the power of free will. We have heard
   sometimes that men come to Christ by themselves. That there is no power
   of Irresistible Grace which turns them from darkness to light, and from
   the power of sin and Satan unto God. Ah, we have heard this, but we
   have never seen it! To this moment, though we have mingled with all
   classes of Christians, we did never yet meet with a single Believer who
   declared that his conversion was the result of his own efforts and that
   his coming to Christ was entirely through the power of his own free
   will! We have been told, too, that God forsakes His people, that real
   saints, after all, turn back and perish! But we bless God that, though
   we have often heard this, we have never, never seen it--

   "If ever it should come to pass, One of His sheep should fall away! My
   fickle, feeble soul, alas,

   Would fall a thousand times a day!"

   But being kept in safety by another and greater power than our own, and
   preserved in the midst of appalling temptations, we still hold to it
   that He does keep His people! We have heard it, and we have seen it,
   but the other doctrine we have heard, but, thank God, we have never
   seen! And so there are many other things that pass current in certain
   sections of Christendom as being true, which, if they were brought to a
   practical test, might be seen not to be so. We have heard them--heard
   them delivered with a glowing eloquence that might have convinced us,
   if we were to be convinced, but we have referred to the Old Book--and
   the Old Book has been more to us than all the siren-songs that sweetest
   oratory could raise! We have nailed our colors to the mast and could
   not take them down! We have found all here in this blessed Bible to be
   true, but man's word, when it has come into conflict or even
   competition with God's Word, we have found to be light as chaff and as
   easily consumed as the fat of rams upon the altar's fire!

   Now, just for a little time I thought we would illustrate this general
   Truth of God that in the things of God, and in the Church of God," as
   we have heard, so have we seen. "Now, mark--

   I. IT HAS BEEN SO ALL DOWN THE LINE OF REVELATION.

   Could a man have lived a sevenfold Methuselah life and have stood at
   the gates of Paradise, and listened to the first promise that the Seed
   of the woman would bruise the serpent's head. If he could have beheld
   Noah shut in in the ark and marked the Covenant rainbow when for the
   first time it spanned the clouds. If he could have lived in Abraham's
   day and have seen the father of that seed in which all the nations of
   the earth should be blessed. Could he have marked all the types and
   ceremonies which Israel saw in the wilderness, all pointing onwards to
   a coming Savior. If he could have listened to the prophetic utterances
   of David in some of those matchless Psalms which are full of the
   Messiah. Could he have heard the notes of Isaiah when he spoke of Him
   who was despised and rejected of men, a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
   with grief. Yes, could he have heard every prophecy and beheld every
   symbol, and listened to every sacred portent-- when he came to behold
   the Person of Christ, to see Him living, dying, rising, ascending and
   to mark the Pentecost, and to see the history of the Church right down
   until now--such a grave and revered man--revered and venerable above
   all other men through the long lapse of years that had passed over his
   snowy head, would say, "As I heard during the first portion of my life,
   so have I seen in the latter days thereof--God has always kept His
   promise--as was the shadow, so was the substance! As the type, so was
   the antitype! As the word that flowed from prophetic lips, so was the
   Christ who, in the fullness of time, came into this world to bless and
   redeem mankind!"

   This is not merely a great general Truth of God, but, mark you, it is
   true in every jot and tittle! We do not expect men, when they speak
   frequently, so to speak that every particle of what they say may be
   correct. We admit them to be fallible--we always make some allowance
   for some slips of the tongue. But all through these thousands of years
   in which God spoke of Christ and of the Gospel Kingdom, there never was
   a single trifling word that was not fulfilled!

   There have been no slips of the tongue, no drops that blot the page.
   Everything has been accurately, minutely, precisely--what if I say,
   microscopically--fulfilled in Christ! As the casket key exactly fits
   the wards of the lock, so the life of Christ and the history of the
   Church exactly fits all the types and all the prophecies! Sometimes it
   has been said that if anybody doubts the Inspiration of the four
   Gospels, it would be a very pretty puzzle for him to try to write a
   fifth gospel which should have in it some new details that would be
   congruous to the rest and that would fit in with the promises and
   prophecies of the Old Testament. That is a task we give to those wits
   who seem to need something to do in these days, since they are
   impugning everything that is held sacred by us! Let them attempt that.
   If this problem could have been put to the wise in all ages--here is
   the Old Testament and, whether it is true or not, construct the life of
   a Man who shall fit all that. Use your poetic powers, or whatever other
   abilities you choose to employ. Imagine a Man that shall fit the lamb,
   the scapegoat, the Passover, Noah's ark, the Psalms of David, the
   prophecies of Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel--why the puzzle would
   have been given up in despair! It would not have been possible for the
   united abilities of men and angels to have discovered an ideal Messiah
   that would have exactly met all this! But our Lord did in every jot and
   in every tittle, so that as we read some parts of the Old Testament, we
   often say to ourselves, "This looks as if it were written after the
   event." We read the 22nd Psalm and if we did not know that it had been
   composed many, many years before our Lord came, we would look at it as
   history, rather than as prophecy! One can only comprehend this by
   admitting Inspiration, and by rejoicing in the wondrous truthfulness of
   God! Even such little points as the casting of lots for the vesture of
   Christ--things which seem insignificant--God took care should be
   fulfilled. And though our Lord died, and as yet He had not been pierced
   as to His heart, at any rate, yet after death there must be a piercing
   of Him that they "may look on Him whom they have pierced," and weep and
   wail because of Him. "As we have heard, so have we seen." The life of
   our Lordand Savior, Jesus Christ, certainly carry out the prophecies
   which God had uttered before concerning Him! But now, we shall go on to
   speak of--

   II. THE CHURCH OF GOD--CHRISTWARD AND GODWARD--AS TO OUR OWN
   EXPERIENCE.

   Some of you have thoughts of Christ--but as dead or as far away. We
   have come to deal with Him as a living Savior. Now the question is,
   whether in so dealing with Him, we have found all true that we were
   told concerning Him?

   Now, when we first enlisted in the Christian army, we were told from
   Christ's own Word that we must count the cost and we would have to
   suffer a degree of persecution. We were warned not to take upon
   ourselves, hastily, to carry out that for which we should have no power
   unless we sought it from above. We were warned, "In the world you shall
   have tribulation." Have we found it so? "Oh," says one, "that has been
   abundantly true to me! From those of my own household I first met with
   opposition! The Gospel has set those against me that were once my
   fondest friends." Just so, but now that it has come to pass, you will
   see how sincerely He dealt with you, that He would not entrap you into
   His service as though it would be altogether a thing of pleasure, but
   He warned you that it was a conflict, that it was a pilgrimage. You
   have found it so and now that it has come to pass, let this help you to
   trust Him for the future!

   But you were also told that if you trusted Him, you who were burdened
   with many sins, you would have them all forgiven and that this
   forgiveness would bring about a solid peace of mind. Have you found it
   so? Can you not stand up and add your name to the long roll of
   witnesses who say, "We looked unto Him and were lightened, and our
   faces were not ashamed! This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and
   delivered him from all his fears"? I bless the Lord I can say that the
   joy of the pardoned sinner is a sweeter and a better thing than I ever
   dreamed it to be. And the peace of conscience, which reflection upon
   the Atonement always brings, is better and more enduring than one could
   have fancied have fallen to the lot of so unworthy an one as he whom
   Christ had called!

   Our Lord Jesus told us, too, that if we came and trusted Him, He would
   give us the victory over our sins. Now, has He done that? I know you
   will sometimes confess that you have not conquered your sins as you
   would desire.

   The battle is still raging--there is still a need for yonder
   watchtower. But, Brothers and Sisters, if a sin has not been conquered,
   has that ever been Christ's fault? Has it not been ours? "They overcame
   through the blood of the Lamb," is true of all the saints with regard
   to their struggles with sin. There is no sin that we cannot pray down
   and weep down if we live at the foot of the Cross. The worst temper
   that ever a soul was plagued with is to be controlled and softened if
   one looks to the griefs of Christ and becomes like He in temper. It
   matters not how constitutional the sin may be, though you may say, "It
   is my easily-besetting sin"--you may be delivered from it! Christ
   Jesus, when He comes into the island of our nature, can drive out all
   the cruel and deadly reptiles that are there. Or if they remain there,
   He can give us abundant Grace so that they can make no headway and we
   shall be kept as "holiness unto the Lord."

   Now, you and I have read and heard from the saints of God that our Lord
   Jesus, when He is really known and understood, is inexpressible
   sweetness itself. They have told us, some of them--writing like
   Rutherford of his wonderful Master--that the joy of Heaven is to be
   possessed, in a measure, even here below! That in contemplation on and
   communion with Christ, the heart can be made to dance with eternal joy
   and full of glory! Now, Brothers and Sisters, have we found it so? Oh,
   some of us can set to our seal that in this thing the saints of God
   have been true! He has ravished our souls with His Presence and made
   our hearts to melt while He spoke into our ears the marvelous story of
   His love! Perhaps in our unbelief we think that this is fancy, or
   fanaticism, or some high-strained sentimentalism, but it is not so! It
   is a sober fact that when a man gets to lean upon the arm of Christ, he
   laughs at trouble, defies persecution--he passes through temptation all
   unhurt. He walks here below, but his conversation is in Heaven! He sits
   down with the sons of men and yet he is "raised up and made to sit in
   heavenly places in Christ Jesus." I would say to you saints who have
   not proceeded far in the College of Christ, who have only just begun to
   study His precious Character and the Divine Virtues that flow out of
   Him, never be content until you have! As you have heard from the song
   of the Canticles. As you have heard from the saints who out of their
   experience have told you of Christ's love, so will you find it! Do not
   harbor the idea that the further you go, the less will you have of
   enjoyment in religion. Oh, no! It has deep draughts of great bliss! The
   shallow draughts will sustain, but oh, it is sacred intoxication with
   the love of Christ which brings the highest joy and the most Divine
   mirth!

   To go in up to the ankles in the sea of Christ's love is well, but oh,
   to pass up to the loins and to get still further until you find it "a
   river to swim in"--this is to know the true delights of godliness!

   As you have heard of these things, though they seem to be too high for
   you and you tremble at them, yet if you will but ask for more Grace
   that you may press forward, so you shall! There are no exceptions about
   Christ! He offers nothingin the market that has been proffered to catch
   the eye, but is not worth the purchase. His diamonds are never trashy
   paste. His gold is not mere gilt. You may buy bread from Him and put it
   in the scales and find it ounce for ounce. The water that He gives
   turns neither stale nor sour--it is always fresh and cool--the further
   you shall go in the enjoyment of it, the more shall you prize the well
   of water springing up in your souls unto everlasting life!

   Now, I might just turn this same point around in another form and say
   that, as we have heard of Christ in His life upon earth, so have we
   found it in dealing with Him. When Christ was here on earth, He was all
   tenderness and love-- and so we have found Him. We went to Him covered
   with the leprosy of our sin and ready to die of our iniquities. But one
   touch of His hand was freely given and that touch healed us! When He
   was on earth He was holiness, itself, and so He is now, for He will not
   walk with us if we fall in love with sin. He is quick to see our faults
   and He gently chides us till conscience awakens us and we turn from the
   evil with abhorrence. Christ was in this world as a very faithful
   friend. Having loved His own, He loved them unto the end. And we have
   found Him just such until now. There was never an hour in which He left
   us naked to our enemies. When we have been tempted, His intercession
   has always been like a bronze wall around us to keep us from being
   devoured by the foe. When we have been bewildered, He has, like a good
   shepherd, led us by ways that we knew not, but that He well understood.
   In the days of famine we have been fed. In the times of need we have
   been satisfied. We can speak well of His name. If any of His saints
   have anything to say of Him that is high and comely, that will exalt
   Him and set Him on high, and we, after our measure, can endorse it all!
   So far as our experience has gone, He is a better Christ than we
   thought Him to be! Oh, He is altogether precious, altogether lovely! Up
   to this day we have never discovered a spot in Him. We have tried
   Him--oh how, sadly, and our sins have tried Him--oh, how heavily! But
   He is always true--the same yesterday, today, and forever! We can only
   bless Him and praise Him, for "as we have heard, so have we seen."

   How my heart desires that some of you who are here would just now, at
   this very moment, come to my Lord and try Him! Oh, I so remember when I
   first came to Him. They told me He was ready to pardon and that a look
   at Him would move the crushing burden from my weary heart. I could not
   think it true, but--

   "I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary, and worn, and sad." And did He disappoint me? Ah, no! I can
   happily join in with the rest of that verse--

   "I found in Him a resting place,

   And He has made me glad!"

   If any of you think that Christ will cast you out when you come, I wish
   you would come and try Him. It would be the beginning of a new method
   with Him--the turning over of a new black leaf. "Him that comes unto
   Me," He says, "I will in no wise cast out." He never did find it in His
   heart to do so to any sinner that has sought His mercy! And I will not
   believe it, though all the angels in Heaven swear it, that He ever cast
   away a soul! I'd call them liars! It cannot be! It never shall be!
   While the heavens are above the earth and God is true, and Christ is
   God, no sinner that comes and puts His trust in Him, shall find Him
   unable or unwilling to save Him! Oh, taste and see that the Lord is
   good! And as you have heard, so shall you see! Now, in the next place,
   I think--

   III. THIS ALL STANDS GOOD WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH OF GOD ITSELF.

   Some have been apt to find fault with the Church and some Christians
   seem to act on the principle of getting to Heaven, one by one. "Sheep,"
   God's people are called, and I suppose one reason is because sheep are
   gregarious and go in flocks. But there are Christian professors who
   seem to like the one by one principle. Well now, speaking of the Church
   of God as we have seen her, she has many faults--many faults--but Jesus
   Christ loves her and she is His Bride. And I dare not find fault with
   her! If she is the Princess Royal, if she is His Imperial Highness's
   own betrothed one, I would rather see her with His eyes than with my
   own! And while it may be very striking to rail about ministers and
   their defects, to sneer at Church members and all sorts of other
   things--and there may be sometimes good reason for it--yet we may say
   much on the other side, too. "As we have heard, so have we seen."

   When we first joined the Christian Church, we were told very plainly in
   the Scripture that there would be tares among the wheat. That there
   would be some among us who would go out from us, because they were not
   of us. Christ taught us that among His 12 disciples, there was one
   Judas, and if some hypocrites intrude among us, it need not astonish
   us! We knew it would be so. He forewarned us and admonished us of it.
   We have heard it and so have we seen--and if the seeing of it has been
   painful--we can at least say that God was truthful and frank in warning
   us that so it would be.

   Well, there were good things spoken of the Church of God and we have
   found them true, too. I expected to find in the Christian Church some
   holy, prayerful, devout Christian men and women--and I have found them.
   And I have rejoiced to be among them, to mingle with them, and to be of
   their company, joining with them in holy worship, the washing in the
   blood that has washed them! I can truly say that I have found a
   Peter--many a bold earnest Brother like Peter. Many a loving John! Many
   a busy Martha and some communing Marys. The Church of God always seems
   to me, as I have seen it, to be a vast deal too good for me to be a
   member of it, if I did but judge myself. And, instead of finding fault,
   I would join with David and say, "You are my Lord: my goodness extends
   not to You, but to the saints that are in the earth, and to the
   excellent in whom is all my delight." I know the world will often find
   fault and rail and tell us there are no such things as ancient
   Christians. I have seen as glorious Christianity as even the Apostles
   saw, and as good works of the Holy Spirit in members of this Church as
   ever gladdened the eyes of those Apostles! I have seen suffering
   endured with an astonishing patience, labor done with a perseverance
   that was most commendable, liberality evinced with a freedom that
   showed that the love of Christ constrained, prayer kept up with a
   fervency that marked the indwelling Spirit and souls cared for, sought
   after and won, too, with an indefatigable love that only the love of
   Christ could inspire! I know we always think we live in the worst
   times, but we do not!

   There were worse times than these and there will be again. These may
   not be the best, but they are a long way off from being the worst. I
   think it was when Dr. Newton died that the good divine who preached the
   funeral sermon took some such text as this, "My father, my father, the
   chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof," and he deplored that now
   this eminent saint was gone, they had no great divines left like the
   great preachers of the olden time. That went on very prettily for some
   time, but it was too much--for an old Methodist woman, who stood in the
   aisle cried out--"Glory to God, that's a lie!" And oftentimes when I
   hear people crying down the times and saying there are no good people
   left, and that Christianity is at a low ebb, and that there remains no
   true zeal, I can say from what I, myself, see in the people among whom
   I dwell, "Glory be to God, that is a lie! It is a slander upon the
   Church of God!" For as we have heard, so have we seen--we have seen the
   gracious, fair fruits of the Spirit--and we honor God by testifying to
   that fact!

   I would, however, dear Brothers and Sisters, that we were always
   conscientiously concerned never to give the lie in any degree to
   statements made in Scripture concerning the holy living of the saints.
   Alas, there are some professors who, if you could track them to their
   business, are so much given to loose trading that as we have heard--so
   can we cannot see! If you go into their houses--their maidservants,
   their children and their wives are obliged to say, "We have heard what
   Christian fathers, and mothers, and masters ought to be, but as we have
   heard so, we do not see." It all ends in talk, in profession. Now,
   while I stand up for it that there are many that do adorn the Doctrine
   of God their Savior in all things and so prove that they are God's true
   people, yet do we sorrowfully confess that many walk "of whom" we would
   say with the Apostle, "We have told you often, and now tell you even
   with weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ." Though
   they are professed members of the Church of Christ, their lips honor
   God, but their inconsistent lives degrade the Church and bring upon it
   much loss of spiritual power. "As we have heard, so have we seen."

   I think some of us can say that we have heard of the Church's glorious
   assemblies. We have heard that they said they were glad when they went
   up to the House of the Lord. We have heard that the people of God are
   happy in their assemblies and that they long for the place where God's
   honor dwells. Well, and so have we seen, for our Sabbaths have been our
   happiest days and we have often said--

   "My willing soul would stay, In such a frame as this, And sit, and sing
   herself away To everlasting bliss."

   It has been so.

   We have heard that the preaching of the Gospel is the power of God unto
   salvation and the great means of comfort and edification to the saints.
   And "as we have heard, so have we seen," for oftentimes when the Truth
   of God has been preached in our hearing, it has been as marrow and
   fatness--and other times a rebuke has come just as we needed it to
   quicken us from our spiritual sloth!

   We have heard that the ordinances of God's House have a blessing
   connected with them. Baptism and the Lord's Supper--that in the keeping
   of His commandments there is great reward--and as we have heard, so
   have we seen. I am sure that the blessed Supper of the Lord, though
   many of His people come to the Table every week, never seems to grow
   stale.

   There is always a freshness in it. Oh, that blessed ordinance! Some, I
   know, make a god of it and an idolatrous mystery of it, but because
   they misuse it, we dare not depreciate it! It is to us none other than
   the very gate of Heaven full often. "As we have heard, so have we
   seen." Let us press on in our Church fellowship and increase in our
   love and earnestness--and then as we have heard of the Zion that
   travails and becomes like the mother of children--so shall we see! As
   we have heard that they who sow in tears shall reap in joy--so shall we
   see! As we have heard that there is great pleasure connected with the
   winning of souls for Christ--so shall we see. In a word, all the
   glorious things that are spoken of Zion, we shall have fulfilled to
   ourselves!

   Brothers and Sisters, before I close, I want to say that there is a
   dreadful side to this Truth of God. As we have heard, so have we seen.
   There are some of you here who are not saved. You have hitherto loved
   your sins and have not repented. You have heard of Christ, but you have
   put off all thoughts of Him. Now you have heard oftentimes that He that
   believes not shall be condemned--and from this Book you have heard that
   condemnation is something terrible and overwhelming, for there are
   words like these, "Beware, you that forget God, lest I tear you in
   pieces and there be none to deliver." And these, "These shall go away
   into everlasting punishment." And these, "Where their worm dies not,
   and their fire is not quenched." Now as you have heard, so will you
   see! Depend upon it, you shall not find the pit of Hell to be less
   awful than this Book describes! God sets up no bugbear to frighten
   souls! They are all realities of which He speaks--and that they are
   realities, many dying sinners have been made to know before they have
   been dead, for their horror, their alarms their fears have been
   premonitions of that wrath to which they were drawing near! I have seen
   some death scenes which I dare not try to picture before you--and the
   memory of which would unman me if I were to continue to contemplate
   them--hearers of the Gospel who had neglected Christ and who died
   conscious of their sins, unable, however, to seek mercy. And while we
   prayed with them, telling us that our prayers would never be heard, for
   they were given over and now they were cursing God, even while they
   were feeling the anguish of lost souls! Yes, and though there are some
   that become the advocates for evil by trying to make out the punishment
   of sin to be little--settle it in your souls that as it took the blood
   of the dying Son of God to wash out the sin of those who were
   pardoned--it will take an anguish such as no heart can conceive before
   the sinner shall have suffered for his sin what God will certainly pour
   upon him! Think not lightly of the doom of the lost, lest you think
   lightly of sin, and lightly of Christ, for as you have heard and
   infinitely more than you have heard, shall you see, oh, unhappy spirit,
   unless you will turn to Christ and believe on Him and live! Oh, that
   you may do so tonight, for another night may never come to you--but one
   long, endless night may be your portion.

   But there is a bright side to it, too. The saints in Heaven might all
   say, "As we have heard, so have we seen," only that I think they would
   make a great improvement in our text! 'Tis true, you heard that Heaven
   was full ofjoy and mercy and so have you seen. You heard of its pearly
   gates and its streets of shining gold. You heard of its foundations
   ofjasper and its walls of chrysolite and all manner of precious stones.
   You heard of its eternal rest and of the Presence of God and the glory
   of the overflowing bliss--and all you heard you have seen! But I say
   they would make an improvement upon this, for, like the Queen of Sheba,
   I think their glorified spirits would say, "The half has not been
   told." Yes, Brothers and Sisters, we have heard things, but, "what must
   it be to be there"--to be there?! The enjoyments transcend description
   and though the words of Scripture portray the bliss that remains, we,
   alas, are dull of understanding and cannot find out all the meaning of
   the golden sentences! But we shall soon be there and once there we
   shall, as I have said before, declare, "As we have heard, so have we
   seen, only that the half was not told us of the splendor and the glory
   of the court of our heavenly Solomon." May we be there to find all true
   and join in the everlasting song of, "Unto Him that loved us, and
   washed us from our sins in His blood, unto Him be glory forever and
   ever. Amen."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM451-9.

   The Lily Psalm--a Psalm of loves. Oh, that our hearts might be full of
   love, tonight, and while we read, may our hearts be singing to the
   praise of the Well-Beloved!

   Verse 1. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
   which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready
   writer Sometimes the heart could speak if it could move the tongue, but
   it is a blessed time with us when, first of all, the heart is fully
   warmed with love and then the fire within burns the strings that tie
   the tongue--and the tongue begins to move right joyously in expressing
   the heart's love! May it be so with us tonight who have to preach! May
   it be so with all our Brothers who have, in public, either to preach or
   to pray!

   2. You are fairer than the children of men: Grace is poured into Your
   lips, therefore God has blessed you forever No sooner does he begin to
   write about Christ than he sees Him! A warm heart soon kindles the
   imagination. The eye of faith is soon opened when once the heart is
   right. We feel the Presence of Christ. We begin to speak of Him and to
   Him. "Youare fairer than the children of men." Oh, I would, tonight,
   that Christ would but lift the corner of His veil and show you but one
   of His eyes! Your hearts would be ravished with His infinite beauty!
   "You are fairer than the children of men." Would God He would but speak
   half a word into our weary ear, and we should say, "Grace is poured
   into Your lips." Oh, for some sense and sight of Him! Do not our hearts
   hunger after this tonight?

   3, 4. Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Most Mighty with Your glory
   and Your majesty. And in Your majesty ride prosperously, because of
   truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your right hand shall teach
   You awesome things. The heart never glows with love to Christ unless,
   in consequence, there is a longing that His Kingdom may be extended. It
   is an instinct of a loving heart, that it desires the honor of its
   object. We long for Christ to rule and reign simply because we love
   Him. Oh, that He would lay His right hand to His work in these slow
   times! How little is being done comparatively! Oh, for an hour of the
   right arm of Jesus! If He would but come Himself to the battle, and the
   shout of a King were heard in our camps, what victories would be won!
   Cry unto Him, O you that love Him. He will come to your call!

   5. Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies, whereby
   the people fall under You. Christ has not only power near at hand with
   his right hand, but far off He darts the arrows of His bow and heathens
   are made to feel that the Gospel is mighty! Would God it were so now!
   Cry for it!

   6. Your Throne, O God, is forever and ever: the scepter of Your Kingdom
   is a right scepter. And this we know to be spoken concerning Jesus
   Christ for this was quoted by the Apostle, "Your Throne, O God." Let
   those who will, deny His Deity. It shall be the joy of our heart to
   worship Him and, in express terms, to address Him who is our Brother as
   "very God of very God." "Your Throne, O God, is forever and ever. The
   scepter of Your Kingdom is a right scepter."

   7. You love righteousness and hate wickedness: therefore God, Your God,
   has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. Fellow
   with us and yet equal with God! Man anointed, the Christ, yet still the
   reigning God! Glory be to His name!

   8. All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes and cassia, out of the
   ivory palaces, whereby they have made You glat. Not only is Christ
   precious, but everything that touches Him! There is not a garment that
   hangs upon His shoulder but becomes sweet by contact with Him. "All
   Your garments smell of myrrh." There is myrrh about the priestly robe
   that falls down to His feet, and about the golden belt of His
   faithfulness that is girt about His waist. There are myrrh, and aloes,
   and cassia about His crown, though it is of thorns! About every garment
   that He puts on, there is a sweet perfume.

   9. King's daughters were among Your honorable women: at Your right hand
   did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. Blessed queen of Christ--His
   Church. Let us never think little of her. There are some that are
   always crying up "the church," "the church," "the church"--but that is
   not the true Church, that tries to take the place of Christ. It is
   anti-Christ! The true Church has her place, however, and that is at her
   Husband's own right hand, where she sits in the best of the best--in
   gold--and that the gold of Ophir, for He spares nothing for her beauty
   and her glory.

A Timely Expostulation

   (No. 3397)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Why seek you the living among the dead" Luke 24:5.

   This question was addressed to certain holy women who came early to the
   sepulcher, bringing with them the spices which they had prepared for
   embalming the body of our Lord. They were met by angels who reminded
   them that their Lord had promised to rise again, that He had so risen
   and that it was in vain for them to seek in the sepulcher the living,
   the Immortal Christ. "Why seek you the living among the dead?"

   The mistake they made was that of seeking for the living Savior where
   He could not be found. We have, all of us, made the same mistake. Some
   of us are making it now. We are seeking good things in the midst of
   evil--hoping to find satisfaction where it was never yet discovered and
   never will be! Seeking, but seeking in the wrong place--seeking for the
   living among the dead.

   To illustrate this, I shall first address myself to the people of God
   who sometimes fall into this error. And then I shall have to
   expostulate with the unconverted, as well as with those who are
   somewhat awakened to spiritual Truth. Say, now--

   I. YOU CHILDREN OF GOD, CALLED OUT FROM THE WORLD, do you not sometimes
   set your affections upon things on the earth and seek for satisfaction
   here below? Have I not observed how some of you have tried to find
   comfort in your wealthand how others, in the midst of your successful
   efforts to extend your business, have thought to find solace on that
   bed of thorns, the cares of this world and the merchandise thereof? Ah,
   how grievous it is when the Christian becomes an idolater! Yet just as
   the Israelites of old--who, though they knew the true God, were found
   in an emergency setting up the golden calf and saying, "These are your
   gods, O Israel"--so, in one form or another, we may be making some
   created good the object of our search, setting our heart upon it and
   indulging expectations of solace from it--forgetting that comfort can
   only be found in our Lord Jesus Christ! "Why seek you"--why do you who
   know so much better--"why seek YOU the living among the dead?" Why do
   you come to the broken cistern which can hold no water, when the well
   springing up with crystal streams is always at your feet? Why will you
   go to drink of the muddy river, the Sihor, when the clear sparkling
   rill of the Water of Life is always accessible to you? You did once try
   to fill your belly with the husks which the swine eat, but you failed
   to appease the hunger that consumed you. Why return to that
   unprofitable employment? Oh, Christian, you have sometimes said to your
   fellow man, "Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
   and your labor for that which satisfies not?" I may say the same to
   you, if you think an immortal mind can be satisfied with mortal joys,
   or imagine that one who has been born from on high can ever find
   contentment in this poor wilderness world! The pursuit itself is a
   folly which is sure to bring you a strong rebuke whenever you thus fall
   into the error of seeking the living among the dead. Your solid
   comfort, your real happiness and the only joy worth having--you must
   find in Christ Jesus, by the power of the Spirit--and not in the things
   of time.

   It is sadder, still, and this sometimes occurs when the professor tries
   to cheer his heart by the silly vanities of worldly amusement. There
   are a thousand inlets to happiness which you may look upon as free to
   your use--you are as welcome to enjoy them as other men. Whatever it is
   that is pure and lovely and uncorrupted with sin is as much yours as it
   is the portion of any other people under the sun. Yours are the
   beauties of Nature, the wonders of God's handiwork and the vast domain
   of Creation wherein are things innumerable to please the eye, to charm
   the ear and make the heart to heave with joy! Learn to use without
   abusing the bounties which Providence has placed within your reach! And
   pray that the delights they are capable of yielding may be sanctified
   to your good. But there are sundry amusements, so frivolous
   andtrifling, that if they are not, in themselves sinful, they verge
   upon that border where diversion is separated from dissipation by only
   a faint line. And as the border is always the most infested by thieves
   and robbers, it is well to beware of it. If the Christian wants to be
   clear from open transgression, let him eschew the place of temptation
   and avoid the appearance of evil--for whatever is not of faith is sin.
   What you cannot do with a clear conscience that it is right, let that
   alone with a wholesome fear of offense. You can peril no mistake by
   leaving it! You may cause yourself a thousand sorrows by entering upon
   it. Oh, shall you that have once leaned your heads upon the bosom of
   Christ profane your hearts with this wanton wicked world? Shall you
   that have once eaten angels' food hanker after the diet of fools and
   drink the intoxicating wine cup of their pleasures? Shall you be seen
   in the assembly where none congregate but the lightest of the light,
   and the gayest of the gay? Shame upon you, Christian! You have
   disgraced your profession. You have disgraced yourself. You are seeking
   the living, not only among the dead, but among the rotten and corrupt!
   Do you expect cheer for your passions? You shall find a scourge for
   your soul! If you are a child of God, you shall be driven back to the
   way you have strayed from with many a smarting sore and many a broken
   bone! If you are not a child of God, likely enough you will go from bad
   to worse, give up the profession which was but a vapor, and turn as a
   dog to his own vomit, and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in
   the mire! Thus, Christian, while I say to you, do not seek lasting
   comfort in earthly things, I am compelled to say to some who bear the
   name and wear the profession of Christians--do not seek your joy at all
   among the unprofitable sports and gambols in which some men delight! It
   is seeking the living among the dead!

   Further, my dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, there is an evil very
   common to the most conscientious of those who avoid all forms of
   outward sin. It is the insidious evil of seeking comfort when they are
   full of doubts and fears, by looking within yourselves. I should think
   that experience might have cured us of this, for when we look into our
   own hearts--although I trust the Grace of God is there--so much of
   imperfection, of infirmity, yes, and what is worse, of real iniquity is
   apparent, that a sight of the inner man is anything but likely to
   inspire us with consolation. What a fool is he who tries to fetch fire
   out of ice! But he is not much more foolish than those who try to
   soothe their anxieties by parleying with their feelings. Brothers and
   Sisters, the Christian's comfort is on the Cross. There hangs his hope!
   His hope must not be based or bottomed on anything he feels. It is
   pleasant to know that Grace reigns in one's breast. Be thankful for it.
   But, alas, if that is your confidence, the next day you may doubt
   whether there is any Grace within! And where, then, is your confidence?
   It is gone! It flees as a shadow. If, however, you live depending upon
   the Cross of Jesus, you can walk with equable comfort at all times, for
   the Cross never shifts its place, the Atonement never fluctuates, it
   never rises or falls in value! Our union with Christ is not subject to
   degrees. We are always in Him accepted in the Beloved. Happy is the man
   who builds on that solid Rock and not upon the treacherous quicksands
   of his own personal emotions! If you endeavor to draw comfort from your
   fickle, changeable feelings, you seek for the living among the dead.
   You are looking for joy where it can never be found. You will gather
   the thorn, but not the rose. You will endure the labor, but not receive
   the reward. You will suffer the burning of the fire, but not be
   enlivened by its cheerful warmth. "Why seek you the living among the
   dead?"

   When the Believer feels that Grace is at a very low ebb with him, let
   him take care that he does not resort to Sinai for the refreshment of
   his evidences. Have you not heard of some Believers whose mournful
   sonnet has been--

   " Tis a point Ilong to know, Oft it causes anxious thought Do Ilove the
   Lord or no, Am I His, or am I not?"

   And in order to get out of that state they have said, "Now I will make
   a Covenant with God. I will chasten myself with fasting and much
   prayer." Or they have had recourse to vows of their own devising,
   instead of going straight away to Christ as sinners--with some such
   language on their lips as our hymn suggests--

   "Just as I am, though tossed about,

   With many a conflict, many a doubt,

   Fighting within, and fears without,

   Oh, Lamb of God. I come!"

   Instead of thus going to Christ, they set to work to be their own
   Savior! If Paul were here, he would say to them, "O foolish Galatians,
   who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the Truth? Having begun
   in the Spirit, are you now made perfect in the flesh?" Beloved Brothers
   and Sisters, make your Covenant if you like, and fast if you please,
   and prayif you can without ceasing--the more you pray the better. But
   when a soul is hungry, it will not recover itself by bodily exercises,
   but by feeding! So what you need is not so much to give out something
   from yourselves as to get something into yourselves through Christ! And
   therefore, turn your eyes, as you did at the first, to the wounds, the
   glorious wounds, of your Substitute, and say to Him, "My Lord, if I am
   not a saint, I am a sinner. If I am not saved, yet will I trust in You,
   now, even though I never did before. I now cast myself on You." This
   will revive you, this will comfort you! You may set to work as you
   please after that, but do not seek for the living among the dead! Do
   not go to Moses, who is dead and was buried years ago! Do not bring
   yourself under the spirit of bondage, but come as a child who is not
   under the Law, but under Grace--and rest at the foot of the Cross! So
   shall you have your spiritual vigor restored and rejoice in the Lord
   your God!

   Once more to the Believer. I do think, dear Friends, we seek for the
   living among the dead when we look to our fellow men to find in them
   some succor or support t o depend upon, or when, as the case may vary,
   we look to our dear children or relatives and think to find a
   perpetuity of comfort there. Ah, and it is very easy for some of you to
   think too highly of the minister. It is possible when you have received
   spiritual quickening and have come to be fed under some godly pastor,
   that you may look no higher than the man, instead of looking to his
   Master! If so, if your faith stands in the wisdom of man, or in man's
   earnestness--you are looking for the living among the dead! Oh, beware
   of anything like that! Let us be held in respect by you for our
   office's sake, but nothing beyond this do we crave or counsel. To the
   Lord Jesus we bid you look, for we preach not ourselves, but Christ
   Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Christ's sake! A more
   common evil, however, is for the wife to feel as if her husband could
   never be taken from her side. But he is mortal. I would not distress
   you with dreary forebodings, but I would have you remember that the
   living God is the only living One on whom your trust can be fixed. And
   you, Mother, do you think that your child can never be removed? Know,
   then, that you are in the land of the dying, and who are you, and what
   are you, that they should be beyond the reach of the arrows that fly
   abroad, and the diseases that work insidiously, any more than the
   children and the friends of others? Oh, if you begin to build your nest
   in these trees, which have, every one of them, been marked by the
   woodman's axe--and must all come down--you are a silly bird, and your
   nest will be lost, and yourself suffer grievous damage! There is one
   Immortal Lover who shall never die! There is one Eternal Friend who
   shall never depart! There is a Father who always lives! There is a
   Brother who sticks close forever! Earthly kinships--value them, but
   hold them loosely. Thank God for them, but think not that they are your
   freeholds. Your tenure is but on lease and a word shall suffice to
   terminate it! Walking through the fields, you might see most of them
   still yellow with the king-cups and blushing with all the flowers of
   this sweet summer month of June, but do not think these flowers shall
   long abide, for already I hear the sound of the sharpening scythe and I
   know the mowers will soon be at their task--the flowers will be cut
   down and the green grass shall be dry. Set not, then, your love on the
   fleeting bounties of kindly Providence as though you could embalm them
   and make them last for years! "For all flesh is as grass, and all the
   glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower
   thereof falls away, but the Word of the Lord endures forever." Fix your
   love on that which is constant--not on these transient things! I leave
   you, my Brothers and Sisters, with the general maxim--having applied it
   in various ways, you can apply it to many more in your
   meditations--take heed lest you seek for the living among the dead, and
   so spend your strength for nothing and reap the bitter fruits of
   weariness and disappointment! Are there not, however, among you, my
   Hearers, full many of--

   II. THOSE WHO ARE NOT THE CHILDREN OF GOD? As the Apostle said in that
   10th Chapter of Romans which we just now read to you, "They have not
   all obeyed the Gospel." I do not know whether the reading of that
   Chapter touched any of your hearts. It did mine. I could scarcely help
   weeping as I thought of some of you. "They have not all obeyed the
   Gospel"--I mean not all those who sit in these seats regularly, to whom
   we preach that Gospel so frequently. Those who come into our classes
   are earnestly taught, but they have not all obeyed the Gospel. No,
   there is a very large proportion who have not. Oh, grievous fact--fact
   which some of you will have to grieve over with terrible remorse in the
   Day of Judgment, unless the mercy of God prevents it! It is with you I
   want to expostulate. Some of you are seeking for joy in sin and you are
   seeking for the living among the dead, indeed!

   Be thoughtful for a moment. God who made you has made certain laws, the
   observance of which is essential to your well-being. Suppose God had
   ordained that the violation of His law should make men happy, would
   that be wise? It is too unwise a thought for us to entertain, much less
   for God to design! You are disobeying God's command--then depend upon
   it that is the way of unhappiness! It must be so. "Oh," you say, "but
   it gives me present gratification." That may be. It is quite consistent
   with what I have said because the enchantment that allures you is the
   very snare that beguiles you--and then for every ounce of joy which sin
   can yield to a sinful spirit, there will be a ton of sorrow inflicted!
   I forbear in this place to mention the sins of the flesh but who does
   not know that for every snap of pleasure derived from indulgence of the
   passions, there are racks, tortures and agonies which the physician
   could better explain than myself. Such a measure of retribution is
   common in this life, but as for the life to come--could you lift for a
   moment the thick veil that hides the unseen world from our gaze, or
   could a sound pierce through the partition that Infinite Mercy has made
   too stout for the wailing and gnashing of teeth to penetrate--I think
   the groans, the execrations, the shrieks of madness of those who lived
   as votaries and died as victims of the so-called pleasure of sin would
   fill you with horror and wild amazement! The transgressor who eats the
   fruit of his own ways, fruit that once tempted his appetite--and drinks
   the dregs of that wine cup, the first sip of which was so sweet to his
   taste--is an appalling spectacle! And this is merely the awakening of a
   man's conscience to his folly. The punishment of avenging Justice is in
   reserve! Disobedience of God must be punished by God with indignation
   that does not relent and pain that knows no abatement! Why seek you,
   then, the living among the dead?

   A moment's reflection might convince a man that this final scene
   inevitably awaits the profligate. Who would think of making his child
   happy in the way of constant disobedience, or of encouraging his
   waywardness by rewarding it? You take care, as judicious parents, that
   your children shall know you govern the house. And if your laws are
   constantly broken, you exact the penalty and the rod is put into
   use--or at least the chastisement is not spared. And shall not God
   stand up for His Sovereign prerogative, enforce His own Law and make
   men feel that they cannot violate that Law without suffering the
   retribution He has threatened? You shall find it so to your cost if you
   will not credit it to your escape! I tell you that if you seek your
   pleasure in the theater, or in the saloon of gaiety, or in what is
   infinitely worse, though too often in close association--in the house
   of shame. If you go to the chamber of the strange woman, or spend your
   evenings in the tavern, inflaming yourselves with strong drink, you
   court misery while you try to avoid melancholy! You render yourselves
   incapable of happiness while you strive to be merry! But ah, you might
   as well deliberately make a pilgrimage to the depths of Hell in quest
   of the joys of Heaven as to seek true enjoyment in the haunts of vice!
   The Lord, the Lord of Hosts will make men see that beneath the fair
   skin of the world's pleasures there is a loathsome leprosy that would
   make them heart-sick were the latent corruption exposed! Oh, go not
   after such pleasures! Remember that God will require these things at
   your hands. Seek true pleasure, mental pleasure that never sours! Seek
   pure joy which will retain its fragrance, refresh others besides
   yourself, haunt you with no hideous ghosts, but bear sweet reflection
   when you come to die! Cheer your hearts with draughts from that goblet
   which will invigorate you when your soul's pulse is beating--the cup
   which flows clear to the last, whereof you may be grateful to sip when
   your immortal spirit is about to wing its fight to worlds unknown! Seek
   not for living pleasure amidst the graves and charnel houses of sin!

   Let me change my tone again, for now I come to address a part of this
   company of people--

   III. THOSE WHO ARE ANXIOUSLY CONCERNED TO BE FOUND RIGHT WITH GOD.

   Some of you, dear Friends, have known the evil of sin and have turned
   from its evil ways. But though you are desirous of being saved from the
   wrath to come, you are very likely seeking salvation where it is not to
   be obtained. A few counsels and cautions may, therefore, be welcome to
   you.

   Do not seek salvation by rites and ceremonies, for if you do, you are
   seeking for the living among the dead! The old Jewish religion was full
   of types--hence the forms and ceremonials that abounded in its
   observance--but it did not save multitudes who in the wilderness
   perished in their sins! And hundreds of thousands more, who had seen it
   all their lifetime, but never seen through its externals the realities
   it prefigured, died rejecting the Lord Jesus, to whose mediation it
   bears witness. Outward pomp and ceremony are of no avail to save the
   soul! Would those who are as fond of vestments and rituals try the
   experiment of endeavoring to heal a man who was sick by such means,
   they would find their medicines have no effect upon the body to restore
   its health. And were they to bring in a man who was sick in soul, they
   would soon find that all their gaudy trappings and rhythmical
   intonations were incapable of supplying balm to a wounded conscience!
   They are dead, Sirs. They are dead, every one of them! The whole thing
   is death! It is nothing in all its beauty but the festering fungus that
   grows upon corruption. The whole system is trickery--a gewgaw to
   deceive. It is nothing but imposture, an artifice of Satan to lead the
   world astray! Were you baptized with water from the river Jordan,
   confirmedwith never so much pomp and took the sacrament, or, as they
   say, "went to celebration" on every holy day and every unholy day
   likewise--and were you to expire with unction on your face and with the
   priest's lying absolution in your ears--you would go down to Hell
   despite it all, if you had no truer faith, no brighter hope than these
   things could inspire! For other salvation is there none but that which
   you can find in Christ, without any priest to mediate, or any minister
   to intervene between you and Him. You are a priest, yourself, if you
   believe in Jesus. Christ is the one only Priest, the Great High Priest
   of our profession! Get pardon from Him and let other men buckle about
   their priesthood and vaunt their succession as they may. Beware of
   them! To resort to these men for help is to seek the living among the
   dead!

   Or, perhaps, you will go about to work out your own salvation apart
   from Christ. You have got the idea that you must pass through so much
   experience, weep so many tears, get into such-and-such a state of
   heart--and then that you must reform this habit and perform that
   service--and after awhile you will be saved and obtain peace. The top
   and bottom of it is, you think you can save yourself! You would be your
   own Savior! Do you not know that every man, according to God's own
   Word, every man is accursed who does not keep the whole Law, "Cursed is
   everyone who continues not in all things that are written in the Book
   of the Law to do them." Now, as you have not kept all things, you must
   be accursed! And as long as you abide under the Law, you are accursed
   in all that you do! If you can be delivered from the Law through
   Christ, then, and only then, may you escape from the curse, for Christ
   was made a curse for us by hanging upon the Cross for us--and so the
   curse is put away and so we are redeemed there from. But so long as you
   are trying to be saved by your own works, you are under the Law. And so
   long as you are under the Law, you are under the curse. To try to find
   a blessing where everything is under God's Law, is seeking for the
   living among the dead!

   I know not to whom these remarks may pointedly apply, but I dare say I
   am speaking to some of you who pant for salvation and you would give
   anything to be assured of your soul's acceptance! You have been
   praying, it may be, night and day for mercy till your knees seem as
   though they would grow to the floor. In your earnest pleadings your
   heart has been vehement till the flesh has grown faint. I am glad that
   you are pleading and agonizing in prayer, but there is no necessity for
   these long delays and for these protracted prayers. Trust Christ, who
   hangs on yonder Cross, and you are saved! The moment you depend upon
   Jesus, past sin is blotted out, you are a new man as in the sight of
   God, your iniquity is forgiven, your transgression is covered and you
   are accepted in the Beloved! Hundreds of times have I tried to bring
   forward this theme till I sometimes fear lest it should sound flat and
   fail to awaken you! Yet some of you have not believed it or received
   it! Yet I bear you witness that if you receive not this cardinal Truth
   of God, you must perish in your sin! Our Lord did not mince matters. He
   offered no three courses, but He said, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." What about those that believe not? He said,
   "He that believes not shall be damned." What if the man always goes to
   Church, or always comes to a meeting? There is no exemption--if he
   believe not, he shall be damned. But what if he always pays twenty
   shillings in the pound and is scrupulously honest? "He that believes
   not shall be damned." The gentle lips of the Savior spoke these words!
   They are not of my coining, they are not my construction. He said it
   and will prove it true. Oh, that you might trust Him, for if you trust
   Him, you cannot be condemned! But if you go about anywhere else to find
   hope and comfort for your soul, you are seeking for the living among
   the dead! Why continue this foolish search? Why persevere in this
   bootless toil?

   Yet it is very possible you are seeking for some good thing in
   yourselfby way of feeling and emotion. "If I felt a more broken heart,"
   says one, "I could trust Christ." "If," says another, "I felt the
   terrors of the Law, I could trust Christ." If! Yes, indeed! Why
   multiply your useless "ifs"? They are vain excuses. Do you mean you
   cannot trust Christ? That is a sad, though, perhaps, it is an honest
   confession. Do you not believe Him to be true? "Ah," says one, "I do
   believe that." Is it difficult, then, to trust an honest man? But you
   do not believe in the integrity and faithfulness of Christ! "Oh," you
   say, "but I do." Well, then, trust Him as the necessary consequence!
   Jesus Christ says that He came into the world to save sinners. And
   God's witness is that if we trust Christ, we shall be saved. If you
   believe that to be true, trust Him! Commit your soul and your soul's
   salvation to Him! "Oh, but I am not fit." Is there a word about fitness
   in the whole Gospel? As you may have come fresh from the commission of
   some new sin, the Gospel does not say to you, "Stand by a while, till
   you are prepared." But it says, "Now is the accepted time; now is the
   day of salvation." I do not find the Gospel telling you that you must
   first be better, but it is said that you are nowto turn to Him. "Let
   the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
   let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him, and to
   our God, for He will abundantly pardon." Oh, I wish you could take my
   Master at His word! I wish, poor guilty One, you would have done with
   disputing, cling to the promises and just drop into the arms of the
   Promiser! Can you venture thus? You shall never chide yourself for
   temerity, or repent of your courage! It may seem a daring thing to do,
   but come, and welcome! Jesus casts out none that come!

   When I came--and it seems fresh in my memory tonight as I mention it to
   you--I came all trembling in my sin. I knew I had not one good thing
   that could recommend me to Christ. I thought He would have said, "Go
   your way, I have not loved you, nor given Myself for you." But I did
   look to Him. I knew I had no other confidence. I did cast myself upon
   Him and He has not cast me away. "I know whom I have believed, and am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him
   against that day." I cannot lead you to Christ--oh, that I could! There
   is One far mightier who can and I hope that He will do it tonight! We
   spoke this morning about the Holy Spirit. Oh, that the Holy Spirit
   might prove His own power to you now! At any rate, this I can say and
   this I do say--Give up that seeking your own righteousness! Give up
   that struggling after emotions and feeling! It is all seeking the
   living among the dead! The idea of your helping Christ to save you is
   preposterous! What could you do? As well yoke a snail with a racehorse,
   that they might win a prize, as for you to help Christ! You, help
   Christ? You, with your rags and Christ with His white linen? You, with
   your pollution and Christ with His holiness? You, with your deep
   condemnation and Christ with His free forgiveness? He needs no help
   from you! He wants your emptiness, not your fullness--your weakness,
   not your power-- your death, not your life! When a tree is loaded, it
   needs baskets, but it does not need full baskets--it needs empty
   baskets to hold the fruit. And Jesus Christ wants sinners--not sinners
   having merits--a foolish pretense--but sinners who are destitute! There
   is a full Christ for empty sinners, an all-bountiful Christ for you,
   famished Sinner, now!

   Ah, some of you poor people drop in here, sometimes, on an evening, and
   I am glad to see you. Never be ashamed to come in your working clothes.
   I know you think I am not talking to you, but you are the very people I
   am speaking to! Jesus Christ always had a kind word for the laboring
   man--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest." Now, it is likely enough some of you are no better than
   you should be, though you have stepped in here in the crowd to hear a
   word. Well, it is such as you are, Christ came to save. "Not the
   righteous. Sinners, Jesus came to save." Oh, you chief of sinners! Come
   to Jesus Christ! This night He will receive every soul that comes to
   Him. Eternal Spirit draw them! Eternal Father, now call them by Your
   power and let us meet at Your right hand, everyone of us, to see Your
   face and rejoice in Your mighty love!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 9:1-5; ROMANS 10.

   Verses 1-3. I tell the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
   bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit That I have great heaviness and
   continual sorrow in my heart For I could wish that I, myself, were
   accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the
   flesh. The Apostle is evidently about to make an extraordinary
   statement--a statement which would probably not be believed and,
   therefore, he gives as a preface the most solemn assertions that are
   permitted to Christian men declaring that he is speaking the truth, and
   also that the Holy Spirit is bearing witness with his conscience that
   it is so--that he so loves the souls of his fellow countrymen that,
   though the thing could never be, yet in a sort of ecstasy of love, he
   could devote himself to anything so long as his countrymen might but be
   saved. "My kinsmen according to the flesh."

   4, 5. Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory
   and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God,
   and the promises: Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the
   flesh, Christ came, who is over all, the eternally blessed God forever
   Amen. The Apostle never omits an opportunity of magnifying his Master!
   Though it did not seem to be called for by the immediate subject in
   hand, yet he must put in a doxology to the name of Jesus. "Who is over
   all the eternally blessed God forever. Amen." How any Believers in
   Scripture ever get to be disbelievers in the Deity of Christ is
   altogether astounding! If there is anything taught in the Word of God,
   it is assuredly that Paul comforts himself, in a measure, by the
   Doctrine of Election which is fully spoken to in this Chapter. My
   subject leads me to read again at the 10th Chapter.

   ROMANS 10.

   Verse 1. Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is
   that they might be saved. The same thing over again--his deep concern
   for his countrymen.

   2. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
   according to knowledge. Zeal is a good thing, but like the horse
   without a bit, it becomes useless and even dangerous. Knowledge is the
   bridle in the mouth of zeal. Zeal is like fire which may burn the house
   which it was intended to warm unless it is carefully governed. There
   must be knowledge in zeal.

   3. For they being ignorant ofGod's righteousness, andgoing about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God. This is a great evil in the present day.
   There are many persons who are evidently zealous for God, but they make
   a mistake in supposing that they are to be saved by their own works,
   their prayers, their Church attendance, their Chapel attendance, or
   something of the sort, instead of accepting the finished righteousness
   of Christ, which is the righteousness of God! They are insulting
   Christ. They are insulting God by thinking that He would have given His
   Son to be our Righteousness if we could have made a righteousness of
   our own, or given Him up to die, if we could save ourselves.

   4. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that
   believes. There is the point--to believe--to have faith. It is that
   which gives us the righteousness of which Christ is the sum total.

   5. For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law. That the
   man which does those things shall live by them. And if any man did, or
   could keep the Law of God, he would live by it--but no man has ever
   done so, or ever will. There is no hope of life by the Law.

   6-9. But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say
   not, in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? (That is, to bring
   Christ down from above). Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (That is,
   to bring up Christ again from the dead). But what says it? The word is
   near you, even in your mouth, andin your heart that is, the word
   offaith which we preach: That if you shall confess with your mouth the
   Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him
   from the dead, you shall be saved. What a wondrous way of salvation--so
   near--so close to us! What an expression that is--"in your mouth." We
   must absolutely take it out of our mouths. God has put the Bread of
   Life so near to us that it is in our mouth! We must reject it as a man
   would reject food, if we perish! But, oh, for Grace to receive it, to
   live upon it, to believe Christ, to trust Him and so to be saved!

   10, 11. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with
   the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture says,
   Whoever believes on Him shall not be ashamed. If, then, I base my
   eternal salvation upon Christ, and am trusting in Him--not in my works,
   or prayers, or tears, or alms, or feelings, or even in my own
   repentance or faith--but wholly in Him, I shall never be ashamed!

   12, 13. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
   the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whoever
   shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved What a comforting
   text for some of you! You want salvation, but you are afraid you cannot
   find it. "Whoever"--what a grand word--"whoever shall call upon the
   name of the Lord"--that is to say in prayer, but that prayer the prayer
   of faith--he "shall be saved."

   14. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?That
   is the point--the believing is the vital matter!

   14, 15. And howshall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?
   And how shall they hear without apreach-er? And how shall they preach,
   except they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
   them that preach the Gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good
   things. You see all the machinery of salvation here. God provides a
   Gospel, He sends a preacher to proclaim it, men hear it--by the Holy
   Spirit they believe it and they are saved. It is all in a nutshell, but
   oh, how blessedly suited to poor, unworthy sinners like ourselves!

   16, 17. But they have not all obeyed the Gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord,
   who has believed our report? So then faith comes by hearing, and
   hearing by the Word of God. It does not ever come by seeing. Faith does
   not come by looking upon ceremonies--by gazing upon processions and
   pompous rituals! It come by the simple hearing of the Word of God. It
   is a matter of the understanding and the work of the Holy Spirit upon
   that understanding. "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
   God."

   18, 19. But I say, have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
   into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. But I
   say, Did not Israel know?Were they not taught that God would reject
   them if they were disbelievers? And that He would call in the heathen?
   Yes, they knew it, for--

   19, First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are
   no people and by a foolish nation I will anger you.And the heathen
   thus, like ourselves, were accounted dogs by the Jews, but the Lord has
   brought us in and made us to believe in Christ because they rejected
   Him! What a wonderful passage that is about the great supper which the
   King made, when we read, because the invited guests did not come, the
   King, being angry, said unto His servants, "Go you out into the
   highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." Even the anger of
   God, you see, works good to some! He was angry with the guests that did
   not come, but then He called us in! His anger against the Jewish people
   has turned to the salvation of the Gentiles, for which may God be
   praised! But, may Israel be gathered, too!

   20, 21 But Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found of them that
   sought Me not I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me.
   But to Israel He says, All day long I have stretched forth My hands
   unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

Love's Great Reason

   (No. 3398)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 27, 1868.

   "We love Him because He first loved us." 1 John 4:19.

   This is the point where all genuine Christians meet. They can all say,
   without exception, "We love Him." They do not agree in doctrine--it is
   a pity, but I suppose that as long as we are in this body, we shall,
   none of us, see all the Truths of God at once, and each man, seeing
   only a portion of the Truth, is most likely to think that what he does
   not see is not true--whereas it may be just as important as that which
   he is able to perceive. Well, well, amidst a thousand controversies
   between Calvinism and Arminianism, and all the forms that various
   systems have taken with regard to this, and that, and the other, still,
   all the elect of God, being quickened by Divine Grace, unite in this
   one declaration, "Whatever we do not believe, we do love Him." There
   are great diversities of experience, as well as of doctrine. Some are
   down in the gloom and some never seem to leave the cellars of the
   Lord's house--they have deep spiritual exercises, they doubt, they
   fear, they tremble and are afraid. Others climb up to the very roof of
   the Palace Beautiful and look abroad upon the fair scene around. Their
   feet are used to dancing with spiritual delight and their hearts sing
   sweetly before the Lord. Theirs is an experience of communion rather
   than of corruption. They have been with Jesus and their faces are made
   to shine with His company. Perhaps if I told my experience, it might
   differ from yours from an experimental point of view--in that we might
   stand wide as the poles asunder--but if we are in Christ, we can, each
   of us, say with equal truth and intensity, "We love Him." There we join
   hands! Whatever we have not felt, tasted, or known, we do love Him!

   And you will notice, too, in this short expression that there is a
   force, a power in it, principally derived from the fact of the
   Personality of this love. "We love Hm." You know, to love an, "it," is
   hard work. It seems contrary to the nature and all the instincts of
   love. Love always seeks a living person to grasp. But when it is put,
   "we love Him," it reads so naturally that we feel that we can love,
   through the force of the Divine Nature within us, with all the vitality
   and intensity of our godliness!

   We can love Him--that blessed Son of God, that condescending One, that
   sacrificing, dying Lamb--that ascended, reigning, coming Savior,
   towards whom our hearts are drawn out. "We love Him." Depend upon it,
   we must have more preaching about the Person of Christ and our hearts
   must assume more and more a trustfulness and affection towards Him. A
   merely doctrinal religion is pretty sure to degenerate into bigotry. An
   experimental religion will sooner or later sink into gloom. Understand
   what I mean. I am not speaking either against doctrine or experience.
   On the contrary, I would say all I could in favor of both--and they do
   enter into all men's lives who live near to Christ--but still make
   either the one or the other the great master-thought, brood over either
   of them, contend for them, live for them, throw your whole force into
   them and you may degenerate! But when you live as unto Him. When He is
   the Truth that you believe in. When He is the Way that you tread. When
   He is the Life that you experience and when the doctrine and practice
   and experience all meet in Him as lines in a center--then you shall not
   be degraded, you shall not degenerate--but you shall rise! You shall go
   from glory to glory, being changed by the Presence of the Lord. "We
   love Him," then.

   But I must make one observation before I plunge into the text, namely,
   that in order to love this blessed Person, being a Person, it is clear
   to everyone who thinks, that there must, first of all, have been some
   acquaintance with Him and then some deep conviction concerning His
   excellency. We cannot love whom we do not know or esteem. If we know
   nothing about Christ, have no understanding of Him, have not in any
   degree occupied our minds with Him, we may talk about love to Him, but
   it will be mere talk. And after we have known Christ, by the reading or
   hearing of the Word, blessed to us by His Holy Spirit, it will be
   necessary for us to be brought into an admiring confidence in Him,
   believingthat He is the altogether lovely, the chief among ten
   thousand, worthy of all our reliance, worthy of all our adoration and
   service! Then it is, when knowledge has produced faith, that faith
   gives birth to love!

   I make this remark because I have sometimes noticed that in addressing
   Sunday school children, it is not uncommon to tell them that the way to
   be saved is to love Jesus, which is not true. The way to be saved for
   man, woman, or child is to trust Jesus for the pardon of sin--and then,
   trusting Jesus, love comes as a fruit! Love is by no means the root.
   Faith, alone, occupies that place. And I think I have heard young
   persons, too, talking always about the question, "Do I love the Lord or
   no?"--a very proper question, but it is not the first, but the second!
   The question that should always come first is, "Do I trust the Lord or
   no? Do I rest entirely in what He has done for me? Am I depending upon
   Him for eternal life and salvation?" If that first question is
   answered, the second will not long remain a matter of doubt! But if you
   begin with the second, and neglect the first, you may involve
   yourselves in very serious consequences. The great Gospel precept is
   not, "Love Christ," but, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved"--not that love is less than faith, but that love,
   though, perhaps, first in point of excellence in some respects, comes
   second in point of order--and that faith is first to be looked to in
   the soul and then love will inevitably and necessarily follow.

   But now to come to the text. I shall treat the first part of the
   sentence as the great general confession of the whole Church--"We love
   Him." And the second first part of the sentence as the most glorious
   reason for that love--"because He first loved us." I am not going to
   preach this evening, but only to stir you up about these points.

   I. THE GREAT GENERAL CONFESSION, "WE LOVE HIM."

   Now, if you are a child of God, you will say, or if you do not say it,
   it will be true, "We love Him." As sure as ever you have passed from
   darkness to light, whether you are an Episcopalian, or a Presbyterian,
   or a Baptist, or whatever you may be, you will agree with this
   utterance of the one mouth of the one Church! We all, without
   exception, who have believed in Him, love Him.

   But how do we love Him? We love Him, first, not at all as we ought to
   love Him. We confess that much with shame--and not at all as we wish to
   love Him. Our conception of what is due to Christ is, no doubt, very
   short of what is due to Him, but we fall short even of our own
   conception! I am afraid that many of us are like the children at school
   who have a good, fair copy set them at the top of the page, and the
   next line is written to imitate the copy, and the next imitates the
   imitation of the copy and as it gets to the bottom of the page--alas,
   poor writing--how unlike it is to the perfect copy at the top! So what
   is due to Christ stands at the top--what I believe about Christ in my
   best moments stands next. What I actually give to Christ comes next to
   that--and then far down the page, how badly do I write and how far do I
   fall short of what my love knows I ought to give Him!--

   "Yes, I love You and adore, Oh, for Grace to love You more!"

   Now, remember, we never make ourselves love Christ more by flogging
   ourselves for not loving Him more. We come to love those better whom we
   love by knowingthem better, not by talking to ourselves about the duty
   of loving them, for love and duty, somehow or other, do not work well
   together. I mean that to talk of love being squeezed and pressed out by
   duty is not at all congruous. Love is like the generous first drops of
   the honeycomb--the virgin honey which drips spontaneously because the
   comb is full to bursting. Such is true, genuine love. If you want to
   love Christ more, think more of Him, think more of what you have
   received from Him. Study His Character more in the Word of God. Draw
   more often near to Him in prayer. Live more in holy fellowship with
   Him. These are the logs that shall make that oven blaze. This is the
   secret fuel that shall make our soul on fire with love to Jesus! We do
   not love Him as we ought, nor as we wish.

   But for all that, in the next place, we do really love Him. The devil
   tells us we do not, but when it comes to close quarters, we can turn to
   One who knows better than the devil, and we can say, "Lord, You know
   all things, You know that I love You." What a mercy it is that Jesus
   Christ does not believe our actions, for they very often say, "Jesus,
   we do not love You." But He reads our hearts, and our hearts still beat
   with this, "Oh, my God! In my very soul I do love Christ, and if it
   were possible I would never sin against Him! Oh, wretched man that I
   am, that I should live so contrary to my true life and that the thing
   that I would, I do not, and what I would not, that I do, for I find
   this law in my members, bringing me into captivity. For I have tasted
   of freedom and am, indeed, free, and will not be the servant of any,
   but will be the espoused one, the free espoused one of Christ Jesus my
   Lord." Yes, we do really love Him!

   And we also, if we are saints at all, love Him practically. We delight
   and that is the true standard and gauge of the man--in that in which he
   delights. We delight in His service, in His company, in His friends.
   There is nothing--I feelsure some of us can say this without
   egotism--there is nothing that makes our soul feel so full of bliss as
   when we have opportunities of glorifying the name of Jesus Christ! And
   if we had the offer of all the kingdoms of the world, and but a grain
   of glory put into our hand that we might give to Christ--we would
   sooner have it than all the wealth of the Indies and all the royalties
   of all the empires! To glorify Christ is a lasting treasure which shall
   abide with us when the world is on a-blaze. To teach one little child
   the name of Jesus. To bring the tear into its little eyes about the
   dying Lord is better and sweeter work to us than statesmanship, itself,
   could be if it were dissociated from Him--

   "Is there a lamb among Your flock,

   I would disdain to feed?

   Is there a foe before whose face,

   I'd fear Your cause to plead?" Some of you are very busy preaching for
   my Lord and I know that when you are preaching, your main desire is
   that He may be extolled in your hearers' hearts. Do you not pine and
   sigh after this? Would you not give up all the graces of oratory, and
   talk in the most vulgar style, if necessary, if you could win one soul
   for Him? I know you would, my Brothers, for this is every true
   minister's desire! And you, too, who have been standing in the streets
   today, preaching at the corners, I hope--no, I feel it must be so with
   you if you are His at all--that you spoke out of love to His dear name
   and when you would have preferred to have been silent, it was love that
   unloosened that tongue of yours! Do you not wish you could speak
   better? Do you not wish you could command attention better? And it is
   all for Him, for His dear sake that you might paint Him better before
   the eyes of men! And you, dear teachers in the classes, you who have
   been engaged in the Sunday school, if you are right at all, and I trust
   you are, you have been teaching because you wanted to make Him famous
   and to let Him see of the travail of His soul. And you who cannot come
   to the school, but have been praying for your children and talking with
   them, you who have been dropping your pence into the box and have each
   been trying to do your share of something for the Master--well, if His
   life is in your hearts and His blood is sprinkled on you, you can say
   that you desire to do all this as a practical evidence that you so love
   Him! All the works that you have done today, done in His Spirit, have
   been a repetition of this verse, "We love Him."

   Now, will you do the same in your ordinary lives, for in this I fear we
   sometimes fail? As a servant, live as one who loves Jesus! As a master,
   as a workman, as a merchant, as a man of retirement and property, still
   let this be the guide of your steps, the order of your life, the model
   by which you shape your conversation, "We love Him." Let every breath
   prove it! Let every heaving of the lungs, every motion of the tongue
   and of the hand, prove the great and blessed reality of the fact that
   we love Him!

   Brothers and Sisters, we can go a step further. I trust we love Jesus
   Christ not only really and practically, but we love Him supremely. That
   point has often vexed good hearts. They have said, "I cannot say that I
   love Jesus Christ better than father, or mother, or husband, or wife,
   or child." No, you cannot say it, and there are a great many things we
   cannot say, which it were better not for us to say, which would be
   immodest for us to say, but they may be true for all that! They who are
   beautiful, talk not of their beauty, and those who love most are
   usually the most diffident about their love. Now, you cannot contrast
   loves, the one to another, as you can contrast five to eight and say
   which may be the greater. It is not an arithmetical problem, but I will
   put it to the proof with you in this way--if you had to lose that dear
   husband, or else lose Jesus Christ, what would you do? Why, it does not
   take two minutes to consider! You would not put them in the scale
   together for a single second! He stands out of sight, above all
   husbands and dearest wives! We cannot consider Him in such a relation
   as that. Or, put it thus--if you had to give up your hope of Heaven and
   your interest in Christ tonight, or to lose all that you have--what
   would you do? Why, I think you would not need to go into that little
   chamber to calculate. "No," you say, "all that I have, why it is so
   little! It is a thing of care to me, and if it were not, if I had more,
   as I would be very glad to have that I might give up more, I would put
   it all away and say, 'Lord, I have left all that I might follow You.
   But in leaving it, I did but gain a greater consciousness of Your love
   to me and a far greater and deeper enjoyment of that love.'"

   Sometimes, however, some of you young people get an opportunity of
   showing which you love best--whether you do love Jesus better than all
   things else, or not. In the case of marriage, that test often comes.
   And ah, how lamentable is the fact that many a young Sister, and many a
   Brother, too, will break through Christ's law, "Be you not unequally
   yoked together with unbelievers." I know this is a perplexing and
   solemn point, mark you. You do, in fact, give Christ up when you take
   that ungodly man! And you, young man, when you seek after that
   Christless woman, you deny your

   Lord and Master--as far as you can do it, you deny Him and give Him up
   for the sake of earthly pleasures! For such an act as that, your
   conscience may well prick you, and if you are, indeed, the Lord's
   servant, the rod will follow you, and in your household the Lord's hand
   will go out against you as long as you live. You there came to the test
   and could not stand it! But I hope there are many, many here who could
   say, "Yes, with everything that beauty could present to attract my
   heart, and all that wealth could lay at my feet to win my regard. With
   all that honor could put before me to dazzle my desires, I feel that I
   must obey my Lord and Master. I must be a chaste virgin unto Him, and
   give myself to Christ and to Him alone." We love Christ, Brothers and
   Sisters--I trust we do supremely!

   "We love Him," also, always. The love of a Believer to Christ is not a
   thing of Sundays, nor of public meetings and Prayer Meetings. "We love
   Him"--it is the utterance of the man sitting at the desk penning a
   letter, or standing in the market selling his corn, or on the exchange,
   dealing in his shares and stocks. "We love Him." Our love is not a
   spasm. It is not a mere emotion, a thing of excitement. It does not,
   like the Salamander, live in the fire, but then die when the fire dies
   out. "We love Him," soberly, steadily, constantly, persistently, after
   a real and serious, and business-like spirit. "We love Him"--it is
   intertwisted with our daily life! It is part of our inmost being! It
   flows in the blood, it breathes in the lungs, it is everywhere about us
   and we could as soon cease to exist as to cease to be lovers of Christ.
   I mean, of course, if we are, indeed, the saved sons of God. We love
   Him, then, constantly.

   And yet another thing, dearly Beloved--we love Him increasingly. We do
   not always think so, but it is true, if we are right with God. We love
   Him more than ever. When we are first converted we think we shall love
   Jesus Christ a great deal more than we really prove to do, and much of
   that love, afterwards, departs, but it is only the superficial and
   half-fictitious love that vanishes.

   Look! Mary is lighting the fire and as the straw or paper takes light
   at the bottom, what a great blaze there is! No sooner is the match put
   to it than the flames rush up the chimney. But come again in half an
   hour--why, there is not half the blaze, nor any crackling, nor noise!
   But is there less heat? Why, see, the coals have caught and the whole
   grate has become one glowing mass of fire! There is not half the blaze
   and the crackling, but there is more real, solid heat. And so is it
   with the growing Believer! At the first, there is much of excitement,
   much of novelty, but afterwards there is the steady, calm warmth of a
   glowing soul! I can only say, Brothers and Sisters, that if we do not
   love Christ, growingly, we ought to do so. He is One that grows upon
   Believers. The more they know Him, the better they must love Him. The
   longer is their experience of His faithfulness, His fullness, His
   freeness, His goodness and greatness, the deeper, and firmer, and
   broader, and higher ought to be their love of Him! And I trust that it
   is so.

   And another thing--we love Him and we are not ashamed to love Him--and
   we are not ashamed to confess it and we do not blush to bear the shame
   which may come to us after the avowal. Ah, perhaps I am addressing some
   here--I do not know where they are--who love my Lord, but they have
   never said so. Oh, you that are on the rock, in the secret places of
   the stair, come forth and let Him hear your voice, for that voice is
   sweet to Him, and your face is comely in His eyes. Oh, be not ashamed
   to confess that you love Him! There is nothing in it of which to be
   ashamed. It might make an angel proud to be permitted to love Christ
   and to declare His love. Ashamed of saying that I love Him? No! Let the
   earth hear it and let it rage! Let Hell hear it and let it boil over
   with fury! Yet is He such an One that as I cry, "I love Him," I feel it
   to be the grandest, greatest statement that Divine Grace can enable us
   to make! Yes, never, in any circumstances make this a thing to be shy
   about, but avow it in your actions and declare it by your public
   profession, "We love Him!"

   Brothers and Sisters, we bless God that the day is coming when we shall
   love Him best of all This tenement of our body is falling away by
   degrees. These fetters of the flesh are rusting off. We shall soon be
   free and when the emancipated spirit shall see Him without a veil to
   hide Him, then shall our love to Him be perfected! Or if He comes
   before our death arrives, we shall see Him as He is and shall be like
   He--and then, too, shall our love rise to its transcendent maturity! It
   is a mercy that while other loves die like lilies, broken at the stalk,
   or fall like rosebuds when they burst and are fullblown, our love to
   Christ shall go on forever and forever increasing! And when Heaven and
   earth shall pass away, immortal love, eternal love, shall still abide!
   As long as God exists, the love of God shall be shed abroad in us and
   our hearts shall continually love Him in return.

   I might pause here to say--if it is true that you love Him, dear
   Brothers and Sisters--love His people better, love His poor better,
   love His cause better, love His Truth better, love poor blood-bought
   sinners better, love the assemblies of His saints better, love His Word
   better, keep His commandments better, draw nearer to Him, aim to be
   more like He! May these practical Truths, though unspoken by me, yet be
   lived out in your conversation. But now for the second head. We can
   only afford a few minutes upon it, but it is a subject which might well
   occupy eternity in our meditation--

   II. THE GLORIOUS REASON FOR OUR LOVE.

   "We love Him--because He first loved us." It is personal, again, you
   see, personal again. "We"--"Him"--two persons--and here is the reason
   for it--"because He first loved us"--persons again! We do not love
   Christ because the minister preached, or we received his doctrines, or
   because we can understand that such-and-such things are in our Lord's
   teachings. The reason for the love springs from Himself, as it goes out
   after Himself. It is because of something that He did and something
   that He said, prior to anything that He did. "We love Him because He
   first l oved us." Love is the cause of love! He loves--we love. We love
   second and after Him because He loves first and before us. He first.
   Now, that is an experimental Truth of God. We know that He loved us
   before we loved Him. Just look back on your life before conversion. He
   loved you then. What made you love Him at all? It was because you were
   told that He loved you and you believed it. Law and terrors never made
   you love Him--they hardened you. It was a sense of blood-bought pardon
   that dissolved you and you saw the love of Christ in that pardon! And
   so, you could not help loving Him in return. This is no novelty--this
   is no mere theory--it is a great Truth of God! I pray you turn it over.
   Jesus loved you when you lived carelessly, when you neglected His Word,
   when the knee was unbent in prayer. Ah, He loved some of you when you
   were in the dancing saloon, when you were in the playhouse--yes, even
   when you were in the brothel! He loved you when you stood at Hell's
   gate and drank damnation at every draught! He loved you when you could
   not have been worse or further from Him than you were! Marvelous, O
   Christ, is Your strange love! What love is this that shone on us when
   we were the serfs and slaves of Satan, the dishwashers in the kitchen
   of iniquity? When nothing was too hard for some of us to do if we might
   but sin--and yet He loved us! And others there were of us who were as
   bad as this--proud, hypocritical, rotten-hearted professors who were
   boasting of our own self-righteousness, as proud as Lucifer, when there
   was not even a good thing in us--and yet we were loved with His great
   love, wherewith He loved us even when we were dead in trespass and in
   sins! Blessed be His name!

   Now, that is a matter of experience, and it is also a matter of our
   firm belief and joyous confidence that Jesus loved us beforethat--in
   that tremendous day, the center of the two eternities, the end of one
   dispensation and the beginning of the next--that day in which the sun
   was darkened and yet for the first time began to shine, that day in
   which the earth did shake and Heaven was established--that day in which
   the dead arose and the thoughts of men were discovered--in that day
   when He, the appointed Substitute, went up to Calvary with all the sins
   of all His people upon Him, piled like a tremendous world--when, like
   another Atlas, He bore that overwhelming load upon His shoulders and
   afterwards heaved the whole infinite weight into forgetfulness! In that
   day He gave the supreme proof of His love to us. Look at those eyes red
   with weeping--see how He loves! Look at those cheeks defiled with the
   filthy spit and bruised where the fists of the scoffers struck Him! See
   how He loved! Look to that dear head still scarred with the jagged
   wounds of the crown of thorns! Look to that matchless mouth and that
   tongue so parched. Look to the whole face, so marred as to be sorrow's
   dwelling place. Look to the whole body so utterly agonized, tortured
   and languishing. Look to the tender gracious hands--those crimson
   fountains tell the tale! Look at the feet--those scarlet rivulets
   declare how deep is His love! Yes, look to His side, sliced open by the
   soldier's spear--that precious stream of blood and water declares with
   double and indisputable force that Jesus loves! And we were not born
   then--we were not here! He loved us first.

   But this grand old Book bids us go farther back than that day! He loved
   us when, in the Garden, our first parents spoiled us all and a promise
   was given that He should come to bruise the serpent's head. Yes, when
   yonder mountains were infants, when the gray old world and its ruins
   that speak of ages were as yet but newly formed, yes, and before
   that--before the sun's great flame was lit by the Divine torch, before
   stars began to whirl in their all but boundless revo-lutions--when time
   was not, when there was no day but the Ancient of Days and He dwelt
   alone, the Infinite Jehovah-- even then, Jesus loved His people! His
   prescient eyes had seen them. His Sovereign choice had separated them.
   His distinguishing Grace had discriminated them and His eternal purpose
   had decreed them to be His forever and ever! He loved us first.

   Well, if this is not a good reason for loving Him, where could such
   reason be found? He first loved us. Oh, cold hearts! Oh, slabs of
   marble! Oh, blocks of granite! Oh, icebergs! If we melt not now, when
   will we melt? He loved us first! That glorious thought like fire rushes
   through and through and through our very deepest nature and refines it,
   and sets us all on a glow. We must love Him because He first loved us!

   Words fail me to speak about that love of His. It was a love so
   condescending that He stooped from Heaven to reach us, laid aside the
   royalties of Glory and took upon Himself the infirmities of earth! It
   was a love so lasting that the ageshave never dimmed it, nor lessened
   it by so much as a single atom. It was a love so enduring that the ten
   thousand provocations of our unbelief and of our sin have never
   quenched it! Many waters could not quench it, neither could the floods
   drown it. It was a love so generous that Jesus gave us all! He gave us
   even His Father and His God, for did He not say, "My Father and your
   Father, My God and your God"? He gave us and He gives us this day
   Himself! He gives us communion with Himself. He gives us His blood to
   wash us. He gives us His righteousness to clothe us. He gives us His
   life for our example, His Throne for our rest at the last. Oh, generous
   Love, nothing do You withhold! You reserve nothing for Yourself! You
   give all to the beloved object. It was a love that was quite
   disinterested. Jesus had nothing to gain. The gain was ours. It was a
   love most self-sacrificing. His sufferings, how intense! His griefs,
   how terrible! And all for His sweet love of us who were His enemies!

   I would I had a seraph's tongue but for one moment--a tongue of flame
   with which to speak of my Master! As I cannot have this, I must be
   content to say that this ocean of Christ's love is one that is not to
   be measured. Plunge into it! Ask that you may be swallowed up in it!
   Pray that it may baptize you, that you may be lost in its overwhelming
   floods and that henceforth for you to live may be Christ and to die may
   be gain! Brothers and Sisters, the Lord's love is over you, and in you,
   and in the power of His quickening Spirit may you live through another
   week! And when we come together again, may our hearts retain some of
   the glow of the affection which I trust we have felt burning within our
   hearts tonight. To His name be praise! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS8:26-39.

   Verse 26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. Our
   weaknesses, our insufficiencies, our inabilities--the Spirit of God
   comes to be a Helper to the children of God!

   26. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought We do not know
   our own infirmities. Perhaps we think that we are strong while we are
   exceedingly weak. The Spirit of God spies out the infirmities and puts
   the help where the strength is required. "We know not what we should
   pray for as we ought."

   26. But the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groans which
   cannot be uttered Those great things in prayer that we cannot ask for,
   which can never be expressed in human language, the Holy Spirit
   translates into groans. And so we are made to groan when we cannot
   speak--and those groans bring us blessings which words cannot compass.
   Have you been into your prayer chamber lately, pleading with God, and
   have you felt as if you could not pray? We often pray best when we
   think that we are praying worst! When there is the most anguish,
   sighing and crying in prayer, there is most of the very essence of
   prayer.

   27. And He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the
   Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God The Spirit knows what we need. God knows what the Spirit is
   asking for--and so our prayer makes the complete round and God sends us
   the blessing!

   28. And we know--We know--we are sure of it.

   28. That all things work together for good to those who love God, to
   those who are the called according to His purpose. We know this for we
   have proved it in our own experience. "All things work." There is
   nothing inactive in the Providence of God. "All things work together."
   There is a unity in Providence. God sets one thing over against
   another. Blessed be the name of God, all things work together for good!
   The purpose of God to His people is good and only good--and though this
   or that might be injurious--yet, all put together, they work for good
   to those who love God. Come, my Soul, do you love God? Can you say
   tonight, "You know all things. You know that I love You"? All things
   work together for your good! Not only shall they work, but they are
   working--they work for your good now! And learn another sweet lesson.
   You are one of those whom God calls according to the sweet purpose of
   His electing love, for so it stands--they that love God are the same as
   those who are called according to His purpose! If you love God, God
   loves you. Your love to God, poor and faint though it is, is the
   assured token that He loves you with an everlasting love and,
   therefore, with bands of loving kindness has He drawn you.

   29. For whom He did foreknow. That is, look upon with pleasure and
   delight from before all worlds. Whom He did love and call to be His
   own. Christ is the Man, the archetype. He is not to be a lone Man. It
   is not good for man to be alone, not even for the Man! And there are to
   be other men called by God's Grace who are to be made like He, who are
   tobe His Brothers and Sisters. These, whom God foreknew, with fore-love
   He has ordained, determined and predestinated to be made like His Son.

   29-30. He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
   Son, that He might be the First-Born among many brethren. Moreover whom
   He did predestinate, them He also called. Not with the common call with
   which He calls other men, but with the special call! The hen, when she
   is about in the yard, keeps on calling, but when she wants her own
   little ones to come and run beneath her wings, then she has a special
   cluck for them and they know it--and they come and run and hide beneath
   her.

   30. And whom He called, them He also justified. He regarded them as
   just. He made them just through the blood and righteousness of Jesus
   Christ.

   30. And whom He justified, them He also glorified. There is no break in
   this chain. The foreknown are predestinated, the predestinated are
   called, the called are justified, the justified are glorified. It is a
   wondrous chain! He that gets a hold of it anywhere has a hold of the
   whole of it, for this Scripture cannot be broken! If you are called by
   Grace into the fellowship of eternal life, you shall be justified and
   glorified!

   31. What shall we then say to these things?! do not know what we can
   say. Wonders of Grace, mountains of mercy, mercy without limit--what
   shall we say to these things? This, at least we, can say--

   31. If God is for us, who can be against us? A great many can be
   against us, but we reckon them as nothing at all if God is for us!

   32. He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
   how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?There can be
   no end to the bounty of God after He has given His Son. He that has
   given the jewel of the universe, the very eye of Heaven--will He not
   give to us all else really needed--and give freely, too?

   33-35. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God
   that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes,
   rather who is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God who
   also makes intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of
   Christ? Dear children of God, feed on these words! They are like wafers
   made with honey, like cold waters from the Rock! Eat, drink and be
   filled. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

   35. Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
   nakedness, or peril, or sword?Well, these things have been tried. As it
   is written, "For Your sake we are killed all the day long. We are
   accounted as sheep for the slaughter." In Paul's day they were being
   hunted to the death by the thousands and tens of thousands. Were they
   separated from Christ's love? The enemy grew tired of persecution
   before the saints were wearied by it! You remember how, in the days of
   the Roman Empire, the Christians came to the judgment seat and
   confessed Christ even when they were not sought after--as if tempting
   their enemies to throw them to the lions, or put them to death! They
   were destitute of all fear and though Emperors were worse than brutes,
   these Christians defied them, outbraved them, vanquished them! They
   could not put down the Christians.

   36-39. As it is written, For Your sake we are killed all the day long,
   we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter No, in all these things we
   are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded
   that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
   powers, nor things present, nor things to come. Nor height nor depth,
   nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of
   God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Good Talk

   (No. 3399)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Talk you of all His wondrous works." 1 Chronicles 16:9.

   This sentence stands in connection with exhortations to offer
   thanksgiving unto the Lord and to make known His deeds among the
   people. Thus it runs, "Sing unto Him; sing Psalms unto Him; talk you of
   all His wondrous works."

   The old typical religion of the Jews and the perverse superstition of
   the heathen made some places sacred and some places unclean--some
   actions holy and other actions, performed however well they might
   be--common and not to be connected in any degree with holiness. But the
   religion of Jesus Christ has once and for all swept away all holy
   places-- wherever man is holy, every place is hallowed! Jesus Christ
   has consecrated the world by His Presence and wherever man chooses to
   worship, there is a house for God. The religion of Jesus Christ has
   also swept away those distinctions which men make as to actions being
   necessarily religious or irreligious. Some will have it that to sing a
   Psalm is to worship God--a sacred thing--but to feed the sparrows is,
   according to them, a secular matter. To come up to a place that shall
   be set apart for worship and there to bow the knee in prayer is
   adoration of the Most High--but, according to them, to perform acts of
   mercy and righteousness is not a tribute of homage to God! Now, the
   very essence of the Christian religion is just this--that it is not a
   thing confined to hours, times and places, but it is a thing of spirit
   It lies not in outward garbs or in mere words, but pervades the whole
   spirit of man and makes him turn his entire life into worship! Then
   every action he performs in its spirit and under its influence is
   holiness unto the Lord! God is worshipped by servants who fulfill the
   duties of their station. By judges who decree righteousness. By
   merchants who deal justly. By children who obey their parents, and by
   parents who train up their children in the fear of the Lord. There is
   not a line to be drawn anywhere, so that you can say, "Outside of that
   you go beyond the sanctuary of religion and get into the outer courts
   frequented by the multitude." Here has been the great mistake which
   some Christians have made with regard to politics. They have supposed
   that a man could not be a Christian and a politician, too. Hence much
   injustice has been done. The fact is, when a man feels, "There is
   nothing that belongs to man but what may be consecrated to God," and
   when he says, "I, being God's servant, may take all that belongs to man
   and devote it as holiness unto the Lord," he reaches the highest order
   of manhood and illustrates the highest style of Christianity. We cannot
   fully exhibit the spirit of Jesus Christ till we have learned that we
   must carry out in every place--and in every sphere--the spirit of His
   religion.

   I make these remarks because while we are first bid to sing unto God's
   praise, we are next told to talk about His wondrous works. There is a
   praising for the assembly. There is a talking for the fireside--and
   both are to be holy! The praise is to be hearty, sincere, unanimous,
   full of animation--the talk is to be equally sincere, equally earnest,
   equally sacred. You are not to say, "I have done with praising God,"
   when the hymn is over and you begin to open your mouths upon ordinary
   topics! But in your ordinary conversation, in the fields, by the
   wayside, in the streets and in your chambers, you are still to go on
   praising God and talking of all His wondrous works.

   Shall there be a connection established between such a common word as,
   "talk," and such grand swelling words as "the wondrous works of God"?
   We wonder to find the little monosyllable in such a place! "Preach you
   of all His wondrous works," would seem well enough. "Show them," would
   seem sound theology, but talk you, talk you--in your ordinary, common,
   everyday conversation--make the wondrous works of God to be your
   conversation, your familiar talk! We must talk. We seem born to talk!
   We were, wretched, indeed, if we were forbidden to speak to our fellow
   creatures! Why, the world seems to be enlivened by continuous, not to
   say, incessant, talking--from the first blush of morning, on through
   all the bustling day and far into the shades of drowsy night--how our
   tongues are occupied! They run morequickly than our feet and carry
   less, though much mischief, sometimes, comes from their babble. They
   are sharper than razors, some of them, and cut deeper than swords, and
   kindle fire enough to set the world in a blaze! Now, this talking to
   which women are proverbially disposed and in which men indulge as
   freely as inclination prompts them--to be heard in every street, in
   every house and in every workshop--this it is which is to be
   consecrated unto God! The streams of conversation are everywhere to be
   drawn off from the gutters and channels in which they gather
   defilement--to be strained, cleansed and purified till they become
   fresh, clear and sparkling! Then the speech of humans--man with man,
   saint with saint, redeemed from the beggarly elements of common
   slander, envy, foolishness and vanity shall be lifted up as on eagles'
   wings till it is like the fellowship of the angels realizing the
   prediction of the Psalmist to the praise of the Lord-- "They shall
   speak of the glory of Your Kingdom and talk of Your power." Now,
   first--

   I. THE SUBJECT HERE SUGGESTED FOR OUR COMMONPLACE TALK--HIS WONDROUS
   WORKS-- invites notice!

   Brothers and Sisters, we ought to talk more about God's wondrous works
   as we find them in Holy Scripture. Do you read them? Alas, in how many
   a case the Bible is the least read book in the house! I am inclined to
   think that although there may be more Bibles in England than any other
   book, there is less of Bible reading than anything else in literature!
   The sacred volume seems to be scarcely known to many, except from
   Chapters read in the public services, and the quotations of the
   minister, while alas, alas, for us, our conversation has very little in
   it of the records of the mighty acts of the Lord! But the old saints
   were known to speak to one another about the historical parts of
   Scripture. They dwelt full often, and never seemed happier than when
   they were dwelling upon it--on that story of the Red Sea, when the Lord
   smote Rahab and broke the head of the dragon. How they would stand
   together and speak of the Books of the wars of the Lord, of what He did
   by the brook Arnon, and how He led His servants through Jordan and
   brought them into the Promised Land, cast out the Canaanites and slew
   their kings! They talked of these things, not merely as historical
   events, but as seeing the Lord in them all! And they so spoke and so
   read of them as to see in them subjects worthy of their study. I do not
   know how it is, but we do not get at the history of our own country in
   anything like the way in which one might desire, for really, the
   wondrous works of God which He has done here in this land are such as
   we ought to speak of at our firesides! We should look upon the events
   of history and the chronicles of each day in this light. And if, as we
   scanned the ample pages of history, rich with the spoils of time, we
   saw God's hand fashioning its contingencies and molding them into
   destiny--and the impress of His footsteps upon all its stupendous
   revolutions--we should not lack for topics of conversation, but our
   memories would be stored, our interest excited, our minds elevated with
   noble passions and our social conversation ennobled by the
   inexhaustible resources of wisdom as we talked of all the wondrous
   works of the

   Lord!

   But, Brothers and Sisters, our own history will enable us to relate
   such a multitude of tender mercies as may well become incentives to
   gratitude and praise. How much might we tell of what the Lord has done
   for us personally! Here is a subject that shall never be exhausted.
   Talk to one another--especially to those who can understand you because
   they have felt the same--of the long-suffering of God when you were in
   your ungodly estate--the wonders of that love which tracked you with
   its many warnings while you were still strangers to yourselves and to
   God. Talk of that Almighty Power which, when the predestinated hour had
   come, laid hold upon you and made you yield! Speak of what the Lord did
   for you when you were in the low dungeon of your own
   self-abhorrence--how He met with you when you were brought to death's
   door--how Jesus appeared for you and clothed you with His
   Righteousness--and your spirit revived and your heart was glad. Shall
   the slave ever forget the music of his chains when they dropped from
   his wrists? And will you ever cease to speak of that happy day, the
   happiest of all days, when all the chains of your transgression were
   forever broken off at the love touch of your Redeemer? Oh, no! Talk
   still of the wondrous works of God as connected with your conversion.
   And since that time, however quiet your life may have been, I am sure
   there has been much in it that has tenderly illustrated the Lord's
   Providence, the Lord's guidance, the Lord's deliverance, the Lord's
   upholding and sustaining you! You have been, perhaps, in poverty--and
   just when the barrel of meal was empty--then you were supplied. Talk of
   His wondrous works! You have been in great temptation and when you were
   reeling under it, or when you were slandered and no name was thought
   bad enough for you, His sweet love has appeared to you and helped you
   to rejoice in this, also, for Christ's name sake. Talk of this! You
   have gone, perhaps, Christian, through fire and through water--yours
   has been a very checkered life. You have fought with lions, or have
   stood in the Valley of the Shadow of Death--but in it all

   God's aid has been very wonderful! There have been miracles, heaped
   upon miracles along your pathway! Perhaps you are like the Welsh woman
   who said that the Ebenezers which she had set up at the places where
   God had helped her were so thick that they made a wall from the very
   spot she began with Christ to that she had then reached! Is it so with
   you? Then talk--talk you of all His wondrous works! I am sure you would
   find such talk most interesting, most impressive, and most instructive,
   for the things we have seen and experienced, ourselves, generally wear
   a novelty and abound in interest beyond any narrative we get from
   books, or any unauthenticated story we pick up secondhand. Tell them
   how God has led you, fed you and brought you to this day--and would not
   let you go!

   There is a topic for you--and you never shall know how large it is.

   II. THE EXCELLENCY OF THIS SUBJECT IS BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE.

   Were we to talk more of God's wondrous works, there would be this
   negative good, that we should talk less about our own works. A man
   never lowers himself more than when he tries to lift himself up. There
   are some whose propensity is to use vain swelling words about their own
   doings--and they seem to be never better pleased than when they are
   bragging and saying, "I did this. I did that. I did the other." "Talk
   you of all His wondrous works." As for your puny actions, if you judge
   and estimate them properly, you will find more to mourn over than to
   boast of! Give to the Lord the glory that is due unto His name and your
   discretion shall not be periled.

   If we talked more of God's wondrous works, we would be free from
   talking of other people's works. It is easy to criticize those we
   cannot rival, and carp at those we cannot emulate. He who could not
   carve a statue, or make a single stroke of the chisel correctly, is
   quick to point out where the handicraft of the greatest sculptor might
   have been improved. It is a poor, pitiful occupation, that of picking
   holes in other people's coats--and yet some people seem so pleased when
   they can perceive a fault that they roll it under their tongue as a
   sweet morsel! Why should this be? Why should you find fault with God's
   servants in this way? They are not your servants, but His servants--He
   will call them to account. He does not ask you to be thus officious.
   Talk you of His wondrous works and you will not speak so unkindly of
   His servants!

   Did we talk more of God's wondrous works, it would keep us from the
   ordinary frivolities of conversation. In the olden times they that
   feared the Lord spoke often, one to another, and the Lord listened and
   heard--and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that
   feared the Lord and that thought upon His name. Suppose for a moment
   that our ordinary conversation were taken down by an eavesdropper, as
   in the case mentioned by Malachi? I do not know what your conversation
   was about at tea-time this evening, but supposing that somebody had
   been listening and hearing--and that you knew for certain that it was
   going to be put into a book and printed--would you feel quite easy?
   Suppose we could have put down in a book the talk of all our people
   during the day--and could have it all read out? I am afraid we would
   find that our talk is not always such as edifies and not always
   seasoned with salt! In fact, some Christian people never thoroughly
   talk good Gospel talk unless somebody is present in whose esteem it is
   likely to raise them, or until they get into such company as they
   suppose will relish it--and then they feel compelled to accommodate
   themselves to the occasion. The habit of thoroughly good godly talk is
   not common among professors. I wish it were. I wish that not only
   sometimes our talk were what God would have it to be, but that it were
   alwaysso, that our common conversation were like salt ministering
   Divine Grace unto the hearers.

   As there is a negative excellence about this subject of conversation,
   so there is also a positive excellence. Supposing we were to talk more
   of God's wondrous works--when the habit was acquired, it would
   necessitate stricter habits of observation and of discrimination in
   watching the Providence of God. Memory, the treasure house of the mind,
   must have its goods assorted and its records indexed so that the things
   of which we hear and read might not only be well retained, but easily
   referred to. As Cowper says--

   "But conversation, choose what theme we may,

   And chiefly when religion leads the way,

   Should flow like waters after summer showers,

   Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers." Alas, the mercies of God
   flow by us like a river! We forget to count their multitudinous waves.
   We receive the mercies fresh every day and take but slight account of
   them! Too often they are--

   "Forgotten in unthankfulness,

   And without mention, die."

   The spirit of observing God in all things was prevalent among our
   Puritan ancestors. They saw God in every single drop of rain and in
   every ray of sunlight. They were known to talk about the most common
   changes of the atmosphere as coming from the hand of God! They speak of
   incidents which we might account trivial as connected with the decrees
   of Him who orders all things after the counsel of His own will. Oh,
   that we, too, amidst the various maze of life, could thus learn to
   track the course "of boundless wisdom and of boundless love"! Such
   conversation, Brothers and Sisters, would be very ennobling. Why, it
   would liken us to the ancient saints and the spirits before the Throne
   of God! What is their conversation there? How they talk of God's
   wondrous works, God's works in Creation, God's works in Providence,
   God's works in Grace! They are too taken up with the splendor of the
   Divine Presence to suffer their pure conversation to degenerate into
   any meaner theme. Yes, and living as we do in the Presence of God,
   professing to have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us and to have been
   lifted up from the world into communion with Jesus Christ, it ought to
   be our holy ambition to let our conversation be of things that are like
   our standing--things that are worthy of our high calling and
   profession--things that have to do with our election and will help us
   onward to our eternal portion! We would not be so groveling, as we are,
   if we talked more of the wondrous things of God.

   And Beloved, while holding this lofty fellowship of heart and tongue,
   how would our gratitude glow and what an impulse would be given to our
   entire life!I do not know how you find it, but with me it is no easy
   matter to maintain spiritual life in the fullness of its vigor. To go
   week after week, month after month, and year after year, plodding on in
   the pilgrimage is hard work! It needs no small degree of strength,
   resolve and skill. If it were one tremendous leap, we could soon
   perform it. If it were but a spurt in the race, we might soon win the
   prize--but to go on, on, on--and still to keep up our zeal, still to be
   awake, still to be earnest--here it is one feels the need of the
   mercies of God to be means of Grace to us, to refresh our gratitude and
   put fresh fuel upon the altar. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, we have not
   lived yet! We do not seem to recognize what the Christian life really
   means! When I instanced our conversation just now as being poor, and
   mean, and barren, I did but cull one mildewed leaf out of the whole
   field, for I fear our whole life is much alike. Lord, revive us! What
   means is He likely to use except He employs the rod of chastisement as
   the renewal of our memory of His great loving kindness, that we may be
   constrained to dedicate ourselves more fully unto Him? But times flies.
   Let me proceed, therefore--

   III. TO URGE THIS TALKING, ORDINARILY AND COMMONLY, ABOUT GOD'S
   WONDROUS WORKS.

   I have already said that it would prevent much evil and do us much
   good. May I not safely add that it would be the means of doing much
   good to others? If we spoke often of God's wondrous works, we might
   impress the sinner. We might enlighten the ignorant. We might comfort
   the desponding. You say, "But how are we to do it?" I reply, "How is it
   you have notdone it before?" If we began early in our Christian course
   to make Jesus Christ our companion in the family and everywhere we
   went--and to take Him always with us--we would never leave off! It
   would become the business of our life! I have noticed that many
   Christian people delay in this matter for years. They cultivate habits
   of retirement and reticence more upon this subject than upon any other!
   Perhaps it is a long time after they have believed that they come
   forward to obey the second great command of Baptism--and the same
   shyness happens with regard to their talking about Christ in all
   companies. They do love Him--at least in the judgment of charity, we
   trust they do. We acknowledge them, but having never began at the first
   to acknowledge Him openly, they cannot break the ice now. If they had
   then had the courage to say, "I have given Christ my tongue and mean to
   use it for Him. I am His servant and I mean to serve Him wherever I
   go," they would still have continued the profession and the practice!
   Brothers and Sisters, is it shyness that restrains you? Take care it is
   shyness and not cowardice! Say to yourselves, each one of you--

   "Am I a soldier of the Cross, A follower of the Lamb? And shall I fear
   to own His cause, Or blush to speak His name?"

   What? In the presence of the noble army of martyrs who feared not to
   die, do you fear to speak? What? If they stood on the burning firewood
   for Christ, cannot you bear, if so it must be, a jeer or sarcasm? Must
   you be wickedly dumb when you might do so much for Christ in the circle
   where His Providence has cast you? Oh, be ashamed of having been
   ashamed! Ask the Master that whatever fear you have, you may be
   delivered from the fear of man which brings a snare! "Talk you of all
   His wondrous works."

   But some will object, "I have no gifts or ability." No, my Brother, my
   Sister--it does not need any ability to talk, or else there would not
   be so much talk in the world as there is--talk in the ordinary strain,
   the commonplace prattle which breaks the silence of the world. It is
   what everybody is doing. There is no gifted tongue requisite. There are
   no powers of eloquence invoked. Neither laws of rhetoric nor rules of
   grammar are pronounced indispensable in the simple talk that my text
   inculcates, " Talk you of all His wondrous works." I beg your pardon
   when you say you cannot do this. You cannot because you will not! If
   you would, you could speak well of His name. Because there is no need
   of ability in anyone to say something for Jesus after an ordinary sort,
   I press it upon you!

   Are you a nursemaid? Talk of His name to the little prattlers with whom
   you are entrusted. Or are you a crossing-sweeper? Friend, there are
   some you can get at that I could not! I will be bound to say the
   crossing-sweeper has a friend who would be frightened if I were to
   speak to him. "But I am so poor," you reply. "I work in the midst of
   such a ribald, blaspheming set." Ah, Friend, but you can talk! I know
   you can! There are times when you can talk even to those blasphemers!
   It is little use talking to a drunk--it is like casting pearls before
   swine. But he is not always drunk! There is a time of sobriety--and
   then it is that you are to go to work. You are not so to talk of Christ
   as to stop the mill, or to interpose your religion in the way of
   business. That were indiscreet. But there are leisure times, there are
   hours for dinner, there are times when they talk to you--and then is
   your time to talk to them. As the profane take the liberty to force
   their irreligion upon you, so you take the liberty to force your
   religion upon them! Use your wits. Find out the proper times and then
   turn them to the best account. "In the morning sow your seed, and in
   the evening withhold not your hand, for you know not which shall
   prosper, this or that."

   I have only one aim tonight--if I can succeed in it, I shall be very
   thankful--that Christian people shall talk more of the love of God at
   the table! At the breakfast table, at the tea table, at the dinner
   table--that domestic companionship and social hospitalities may be
   hallowed! And this without depriving them of their genial conviviality,
   but rather infusing into them a higherentertainment. That we who are
   masters shall talk of the things of God so that our servants shall hear
   of them and that servants shall so speak of Christ that their fellows
   shall hear about Him. The great weapon of the Christian religion has
   been the public preaching of the Word, nor would I disparage it, but it
   will never evangelize the nations unless there is attendant with it a
   constant reiteration of the preached Truth of God till it flows through
   innumerable little conduits into every circle of society! Wycliffe was
   but one man, but he taught others to read. One page of Matthew's Gospel
   and the Epistle to the Romans was given to each. They went out and read
   it in the streets. And so was the Truth of God spread until it was said
   that you could not meet two men on the roadside, but one of them would
   be a Lollard! In Luther's day it was not merely the preaching of
   Luther, it was the singing of the hymns and the Psalms at the
   spinning-wheel! It was the occupation of the solitary colporteur--it
   was the general chit-chatting with everybody at the blacksmith fire, in
   the farmyard, on the Exchange! Curiosity was excited, enquiry was
   prompted, the popular conversation was inoculated! The fever of that
   healthful sickness--repentance toward God--was spread abroad and
   communicated from one to another! "Have you heard the news? Have you
   heard that Luther has proclaimed that men are justified by faith and
   not by works?" It was this that shook Rome! It is this which will shake
   her yet again. The waking up of Christian life throughout the entire
   body of the Church of God--and the enlisting of the entire life of the
   Christian Church in the cause of Christ is an enterprise to be
   consummated by the individual agency of each--and the general action of
   all who seek the Glory of God and the welfare of man! Talk you,
   therefore, of all His wondrous works!

   Oh, that there should be any here who never thought of God, much less
   talked of His wondrous works! Wondrous, indeed, is God's patience that
   has kept you alive! Marvelous His long-suffering that, after having
   neglected Him all these years, He has not cut you down! The ox knows
   its owner, and the ass its master's crib, but you have not known God!
   You would not keep a dog that would not follow you. You would soon
   dispose of an ox that was of no service to you. Oh, why has God kept
   you? It is a wonder! Here is another wonder--He bids us entreat you,
   allure you, encourage you with a saving promise, "He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved." Take heed of this Gospel! May the Holy
   Spirit make you yield to it. Trust Christ! Obey Him by avowing your
   faith in Him, and you shall be saved!

   The Lord grant it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 142; 143.

   "MaschilofDavid."An instructive Psalm of David, for we speak to one
   another in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs, and they are a means of
   instruction as well as a means of utterance of praise. "A prayer when
   he was in the cave" and, therefore, likely to suit any of you who are
   in trouble--a prayer when he hid away from Saul and was hunted like a
   partridge upon the mountains--"A prayer when he was in the cave."

   Verse 1. I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
   LORD did I make my supplication. Of course, the essence of his prayer
   was in his heart, but it often helps the heart to use the voice! It is
   much better to pray in silence if you will be heard by others, for we
   are not to pray to be heard of men, but if you have opportunity to pray
   aloud, I am sure you will feel it very helpful to devotion to do so. "I
   cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I
   make my supplication."

   2. I poured out my complaint before Him. As if it were in a vessel and
   he turned the vessel upside down and poured it all out. That is true
   prayer--it is the pouring out of what is really in--not an utterance of
   words which may, perhaps, go no farther than the mere lips. But the
   pouring out of whatever is within, whether it is praise or complaint."I
   poured out my complaint before Him"--realized His Presence and then
   told Him my complaint.

   2. I showed my trouble before Him. We must believe that God is, and
   that He is the hearer of prayer. We must be conscious that we are not
   only using proper words and feeling proper thoughts, but that we are
   doing it before Him. "I showed my trouble before Him."

   3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then You knew my path I
   did not know it. I was so puzzled--so in a maze, like a man at his
   wits' end. My spirit seemed turned bottom upward, like a thing that is
   overwhelmed.

   3. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. I
   could not find out where the snare was, but "You knew my path." I knew
   the trap was cunningly laid, but I could not see it. "You knew my
   path." We are not ignorant of Satan's devices, but sometimes we are
   completely ignorant as to what devices he is using just now, but "then
   You knew my path."

   4. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
   would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.It is always
   a bad time when friendship seems to have died out when those who we
   rely upon turn their backs upon us and refuse to sympathize with us in
   any degree. It is a sad case to be in. "No man cared for my soul."

   5. I cried unto You, O LORD.Ah, that is the thing to do! When no man
   will know you, God will know you! When no man cares for you, God will
   care for you! Prayer is an unfailing resort! "I cried unto You, O
   Lord."

   5. I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
   See how he clings to his God? We never cling to God as well as when
   everything else fails us! To a greater or less extent, all those who
   yield us comfort do, in some little measure, take our heart off our
   God. But when it comes to being lonely, friendless, helpless,
   forgotten, despised, rejected and outcast, oh, then it is a blessed
   thing, with a two-handed faith, to lay hold on God and say, "You are my
   refuge and my portion in the land of the living."

   6. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low. What a blessed
   argument! Nothing can move God's pity like it! "I am brought very low."
   It is not your height that God will respect--it is your lowliness. O
   Soul, it is not your excellence that God regards--it is your need! Not
   your goodness, but your lack of His goodness that He looks at! Not your
   fullness, but your emptiness--not your strength, but your weakness!
   Nothing that you have--it is your lack of everything that moves His
   heart! "Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low."

   6, 7. Deliver me from my persecutors: for they are stronger than I.
   Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Your name.He asks for
   deliverance so that he may praise God in it! So ought we always to
   desire mercies with this in view--that we may praise God the better for
   them!

   7. The righteous shall compass me about; for You shall deal bountifully
   with me. Lord, if You are kind to me, all Your people will hear of it.
   When I get out of prison, they will say, one to another, "Such-and-such
   a Brother has been cheered and comforted. His face has changed. He is
   no more sad." And they will come round me. They will begin to ask me
   how it came about. Thus I shall tell out Your praises--encourage others
   and get to You a great and glorious name, if You shall deal bountifully
   with me. Now, the next Psalm, much after the same fashion.

   PSALM143.

   "A Psalm of David."

   Verse 1. Hear myprayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in Your
   faithfulness answer me, andin Yourrigh-teousness.It is a theory held by
   some persons of skeptical minds that the only benefit of prayer is the
   good it does to us. That was not David's theory. Here, three times he
   begs to be heard and to be answered! Oh, do they think us such idiots
   that we would go on speaking in a keyhole with nobody to hear us? Do
   they think us brought so low--so destitute of wit--that we think it
   worth our while to speak out what is in our heart if God does not hear
   and does not answer? I reckon prayer to be the most idiotic of all
   occupations unless there is really a God to hear and a God to answer!
   And the benefit of prayer is not in itself so much as in the full
   confidence that it is a real thing--and an effective thing--that God
   does hear and does interpose on our behalf!

   2. And enter not into judgment with Your servant "I am Your servant. I
   am not one of the ungodly whom You will judge and cast away, but still,
   even though I am Your servant, enter not into judgment with me. I know
   You will not judge me now as a rebel and condemn me, for You have put
   away my sin, but even as Your servant I fear Your chastising rod if You
   enter into judgment with me."

   2. For in Your sight shall no man living be justified. I have heard
   some living that think they would! They have said that the very root
   and branch of sin have been cut up in them and that they walk in the
   fear of God perfectly well! Ah, but I think they have not, but that
   these are mistaken, for still it is very true concerning the very best
   of men that they have need to pray, "Enter not into judgment with Your
   servant, for in Your sight shall no man living be justified."

   3, 4 For the enemy has persecuted my soul: he has smitten my life down
   to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness, as those that have
   been long dead. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart
   within me is deso-late.Children of God, do not expect to be always
   happy, or else you will be disappointed! You will have more troubles,
   if nobody else does. Depend upon it, that adversity is one of the
   Covenant promises--"In the world you shall have tribulation," is your
   Master's own words to you, and you must not expect to find it untrue.
   You will find it true to the letter! And sometimes the troubles of life
   will penetrate even to your heart and make you feel desolate. When you
   are so, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial as though yours
   were a new path in which nobody ever walked before you. Ah, no! David
   was there! Many others have been there!

   5, 6. I remember the days of old. I meditate on all Your works. I muse
   on the work of Your hands. I stretch forth my hands unto You: my soul
   thirsts after You, as a thirsty land. Selah. As a child puts out its
   hand to its mother, so did he stretch out his hands to his God. As a
   thirsty land chaps--becomes dry--turns to dust in its longing after
   rain, so did his whole being thirst for his God!

   7. Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit fails: hide not Your face from
   me, lest I be like unto them that go down into a pit "Lest I swoon
   away--lest I die--lest my hope should utterly expire! Come, Lord! Come,
   Lord and rescue me!"

   8. Cause me to hear Your loving kindness in the morning; for in You do
   I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up
   my soul unto You. Very heavy, but I lift it up. With all my might, as
   though it were a dead lift, I seek to raise it out of its doubt, and
   out of its sorrow.

   9. 10. Deliver me, O Lord from my enemies: I flee unto You to hide me.
   Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God: Your Spirit is good; lead
   me into the land of uprightness. Or, "lead me in a straight path." So
   it is rendered by the best scholars.

   11. Quicken me, O LORD, for Your name's sake. He felt as if he would
   die and, therefore, he says, "Quicken me: put new life into me." To
   whom should we go for life, but to the living God? And who can
   communicate with us but the same God who first made us live in His
   name?

   11, 12. For Your righteousness 'sake bring my soul out oftrouble. And
   of Your mercy cut offmy enemies and destroy all them that afflict my
   soul, for I am Your servant.

The Day of Atonement

   (No. 3400)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING MAY 9,
   1869.

   "And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
   atonement for the children of Israel, for all their sins, once a year."
   Leviticus 16:34.

   WE have taken these words for our text. The whole Chapter, however,
   will have our attention.

   I must be allowed to say at this time, though I seldom say anything in
   the way of an apology, that this is not the place, nor would time serve
   us to go into a full exposition of the very wonderful teaching of this
   Chapter. If we may ever set any portion of Scripture before another,
   this is one of the most precious Chapters in the whole compass of
   Revelation and, in some respects, the most remarkable of all. It is so
   full of wonderfully deep teaching that, instead of a sermon, it might
   require a volume! And then, perhaps, we would scarcely have done more
   than skimmed the surface. And there are difficulties, I may also add,
   connected with the interpretation--very great difficulties--which have
   puzzled the most learned of the Reformed and of the Puritan divines. I
   do not at all attempt to solve those difficulties, nor profess that all
   I say might be able to support and carry out. I desire to give, instead
   of any attempt at criticism or deep explanation, a simple exposition of
   this Chapter, bringing out of it, I hope, some Truths of God which, if
   they do not belong to the Chapter, are, nevertheless, exceedingly
   precious ones and will, I hope, be useful to us all.

   In a remarkable way God dealt with Israel in the wilderness. There were
   special tokens of His peculiar Presence, as in the cloudy and fiery
   pillars which were the emblems of His Presence, and in the bright light
   called the Shekinah, which shone between the wings of the cherubim
   which overshadowed the Ark. But God cannot dwell where there is sin. He
   is a holy Being. "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts," is the song
   which continually rises into His ears. In order, then, that He might
   dwell in the midst of Israel without compromising His Character, He was
   pleased to appoint one day in the year which was called "the Day of
   Atonement," which should be considered to purify the camp and make it
   fit to be the dwelling place of Jehovah.

   Now, God has promised that He will dwell among men, and He does dwell
   among His own people at this very time. He dwells with them in a
   remarkable way. "The Lord is my portion," says my soul. God is the
   heritage, the Friend, the Companion of all His people, but because of
   their sin He cannot dwell with these believing men unless an Atonement
   is made. The annual atonement among the Jews was the picture of the
   great Atonement--but the real Atonement, the effectual Expiation which,
   not once a year, but once and for all, the Lord Jesus Christ has
   offered--now renders it possible for God to walk with men and dwell
   among them!

   In the ceremony of the atonement, in the Chapter before us, there are
   four things that struck me. The first is-- I. THE WAY IN WHICH THAT
   REMARKABLE CEREMONY SET FORTH THE SACRIFICE MADE TO GOD'S HONOR.

   My Brothers and Sisters, the offense of man against God was, so to
   speak, a stain upon God's honor. Man set himself up in rebellion
   against the Most High! He stood out, therefore, against Divine
   Sovereignty! He impugned the Divine Love. His offense blasphemed the
   Divine Wisdom. Every human sin is an attack upon the whole Character
   and life of God--and sin, itself, is a dishonor done to the glorious
   attributes of Jehovah. Before God can be reconciled to man and deal
   with Him at all, except by way of retribution, there must be something
   done to restore the Divine Honor. Now, we have it declared in this
   Revelation which comes to us from Heaven, that Christ has fully
   restored the Divine Glory and that since He suffered on the tree, the
   Just for the unjust, God can be gracious without a violation of His
   Justice and Hecan dwell with us--with us poor fallen creatures--without
   the marring of the luster of any single one of His attributes! The
   model man has honored God more fully than sinful man ever dishonored
   Him! And if God was angry with the race for our sins, He is now towards
   the race full of tenderness and pity because of the transcendent
   goodness of the new Head of the race, Christ Jesus our Lord, who has
   magnified God's Law and made it honorable!

   Now, this is the Truth of God that was taught in the first part of the
   ceremony on the Day of Atonement. It was taught thus. Two goats were
   brought to the door of the Tabernacle. Lots were cast and the first
   goat was selected to teach this lesson. The goat was brought by the
   people. It was their common property. It would not have sufficed--it
   would not have been of any use at all if it had not been so. Read the
   Chapter and you will see. Learn from this that the compensation to
   God's honor for man's sin must come from men. I t was a man in the
   Garden who dared to rebel--it must be a man, another man, who shall
   honor God's Law so as to set the race in a fresh relationship towards
   God.

   The goat is given by all Israel--the Atonement to God's honor must come
   out of our race, and hence it is that our Lord is the son of Mary, bone
   of our bone, flesh of our flesh--qualified, being a Man, to perform the
   obedience required of man and to right, as a Man for men, the wrongs
   which man had done to God. Note that first.

   The goat which was brought was given up to the appointed priest. God
   will have everything done according to order. The sacrifice must not be
   left to the whims and fancies of men. So the man who shall offer up the
   sacrifice to the Divine Honor must be appointed of God, as Aaron was.
   And so our Lord Jesus Christ was God's chosen One, appointed by God to
   stand in the gap, and for us to vindicate the Divine Glory which we had
   tarnished by our iniquities.

   This goat, being thus offered, must be presented to God, but there must
   be something with it Sweet perfume must be cast upon the live coals and
   the sweet smell must go up before the Mercy Seat. So before God can
   ever be satisfied for the wrong done to Him by the Fall and by our
   common sin, there must be an offering of sweet merits unto Him which,
   let me say, Jesus Christ has most abundantly offered. He took His hands
   full of the, most blessed compound of all the graces and all the
   virtues beaten small, for there was an exact obedience to every jot and
   tittle of the Divine Law. Christ's obedience was perfect in its kind in
   the most minute respects--and this merit has been brought before our
   God, who is a consuming fire, and burns up every evil work. And as He
   lays hold upon this work of Christ, He makes a sweet smell of it--which
   is poured out throughout Heaven and earth--"the savor of a sweet odor"
   in the nostrils of the Most High

   Do not let me cover up, however, what I mean, under the cloak of
   allegory. I mean this--that if God is to accept our race of men and all
   that we have done against Him and still deal with us on the footing of
   mercy--somebody must be found who can be so obedient, so delighting in
   God's will, that there shall be a sweet offering made, as morally and
   spiritually acceptable to God's Spirit as sweet perfume is to the
   nostril of man. And that has been done. When they talk in Heaven of
   man's sin--if they ever there speak of it and wonder how God can bear
   with man, some bright seraph speaks of man's perfect obedience, even
   unto death, and they say to one another, "What man, what man is this?"
   and they clap their hands with joy as they say, It's He that sat at the
   right hand of the Father, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Son of
   David."

   One man threw down the race, but another Man has lifted us up! One man
   brought ruin by the Fall--another Man restored it and made the race
   acceptable to God. If man dishonored God, yet man has more honored Him
   than he dishonored Him, now that Christ has become the great
   representative Man!

   All the glory of Redemption is greater than ever there could have been
   of dishonor to God by sin! I believe that God is more honored by the
   world having sinned, and having been restored by Christ, than He could
   have been if there had never been sin upon this planet and if a
   perfectly sinless race had tenanted its bounds!

   After this burning of perfume, the goat must die. Nothing could permit
   the Justice of God to look upon man at all until there had been
   something more than merit. There must be a penalty. "Die he, or Justice
   must." Man must die, or God's Justice must die. There must be
   blood--life poured out for sin. Now, when that goat was put to death
   and the blood flowed forth into the golden bowl, then, Brothers and
   Sisters, you saw before your eyes of faith, Jesus Christ put to death
   upon Calvary. He who needed not to have died, the Perfect One,
   voluntarily offered Himself up as the Victim to Justice, suffering in
   His own Person, so as to compensate the Justice of God. Do not imagine
   that Christ died to placate Divine Vengeance--not at all--but that it
   is sternly necessary if God is to govern this universe at all, that sin
   must be punished. The very pillars and the foundations of moral
   government would, not to say, be shaken, but actually be tornup if sin
   should be permitted to go unpunished! Now, to vindicate the Justice of
   God, the sword is drawn and who suffers?

   Not the human race. Behold, myriads of the race go streaming up to
   everlasting felicity. Who suffers, then? Why, a Man so marvelously
   perfect, and withal, so majestically glorious, that His sufferings are
   a recompense to God for all that sin had done--and so made an effectual
   Atonement for all the transgressions that had dishonored God! You will
   observe that I am speaking in very popular, comprehensive and general
   terms--and designedly so because I believe I am speaking the Infallible
   Truth of the mind of God! So far as God is concerned, the Atonement
   that Christ made was universal in its worth and efficacy!

   So far as the vindication of the Justice of God and all His other
   attributes are to be considered, that vindication was absolutely
   complete. And whether one man had been saved, or 50 men saved, or all
   saved, or none saved, it would have made no difference. The work was
   done! God's honor was clear! God's attributes were glorified--and this
   was perfectly done by the putting away of Christ.

   Once more. The blood was sprinkled on the Mercy Seat seven times. That
   was typical of Christ, who goes up into Heaven in His own proper Person
   and there displays before God, the holy angels and elect spirits, the
   tokens of His passion, the ensign of His suffering, taking the blood up
   to God that henceforth when the Eternal Mind thinks of sin and the
   dishonor done to God by sin, it might think of the sufferings of the
   blessed Man, Christ Jesus, and see how all dishonor is forever put
   away! You know, when you are reading Scripture, dear Friends, you find
   a great many passages which speak about Christ's dying for all men, and
   about God's having reconciled the world unto Himself. And I know you
   are apt to say to me, "You teach us Particular Redemption--that Christ
   only died as a Substitute for some men." That I always say, and stand
   to--and believe to be a Biblical Doctrine! But do I, therefore, clip
   away other texts? No, not in any degree! I believe them as they stand.
   I count it treason to try and clip a text, or to make it say the
   contrary of what it does say! So far as God's honor was concerned, the
   death of Christ for men so obliterated human sin as such that God
   could, without dishonor to Himself, deal with mankind. Hence it is that
   the wicked live! Hence it is that they enjoy innumerable mercies! Hence
   it is that there is a good, strong, substantial ground for offering the
   Gospel to every man--and a righteous reason for commanding every man to
   believe in Jesus Christ that he may be saved!

   This was the first teaching of the Day of Atonement and every Jew, when
   he saw, ought to have understood the presentation of that blood within
   the veil, that now God no longer looked on the race as being a race
   that He must curse and must destroy, but looked upon it with mercy and
   was prepared to treat it on the footing of tenderness. And that now
   there was a Gospel presented to the sons of men. Oh, I do so love this
   thought, that my sin, which did dishonor to God, which did as much as
   say that He was not a good God, that it was better for me to hate Him
   than to love Him, better for me to be His enemy than to be His friend,
   made out as though His Commandments were grievous and that it gave me
   pleasure to break them--all the mischief towards God that my sin could
   ever do is all put away by the holy life and the blessed death of
   Christ Jesus my Lord--and put away forever, forever, forever--so that
   God can now deal with me on the terms of Divine Grace!

   But my time flies and, therefore, I come to the next point--

   II. SIN IS NOW UTTERLY DRIVEN AWAY.

   There was another goat--and this goat was to live and not to die--which
   set forth quite another Truth of God. I do not think the common
   explanation of this is at all correct. And all the expositors I have
   met with are clear that it is not correct. Some have said that the
   scapegoat typifies our Lord Jesus bearing our sins away in His
   Resurrection and ascending into Heaven. The incongruity of the metaphor
   has always struck me, but there are reasons in the Hebrew text which
   prevent our believing that thatcould have been the meaning of it. The
   living goat was taken by a fit man right away into the wilderness and
   there it was left. What became of it afterwards, we do not know.
   Painters have depicted it as expiring in the midst of desolation, in
   the agonies of famine--a mere fancy picture! The scapegoat did not,
   very probably, die sooner than any other goat--and it is not at all
   necessary that it should. We never need enlarge a topic beyond what
   Scripture says. Indeed, there is often as much teaching in a type's
   stopping short as there is in its going on!

   These two goats had each its name. One was said to be for Jehovah--that
   represents Christ, I say, as making recompense to God's honor! The
   other is said to be for Azazel, which, if I understand it at all,
   means, "for evil." What? Then was that other goat offered to the Devil?
   By no means! He is not evil, but one of the ministering spirits in the
   service of evil. Evil made Satan what he is. He is its slave, its chief
   plotter and schemer, but still not evil, itself! Did you ever
   notice--you must have noticed--that the wrong of evil, the sinfulness
   of sin, even if it were forgiven, works nothing but evil, so that if
   God were to forgive us all, but leave the evil in us, we should be in
   Hell for all that because evil of itself holds Hell and works towards
   its being realized by us. Evil is, in itself, essentially misery--it
   has only to work itself out and it will be so.

   Now, how am I to get rid of this sin that is in me as to the evil
   consequences inherent in the evil? Suppose God to be perfectly
   reconciled to me so far, yet still there is an evil that mischief
   brings upon me in itself, apart from God--and how do I get rid of that?
   Why, through the scapegoat! The sin of the people was, first of all,
   transferred to this scapegoat--all confessed and all laid on the
   scapegoat. Then, by Divine appointment, the scapegoat, being chosen by
   lot and the lot being guided by God, it was accepted as being the
   substitute for the people. The scapegoat was then taken away. And what
   was done with it? Why, nothing was done with it but this--it was
   relinquished--it was given up! Now, can I get out what I mean? I am
   very much afraid I cannot. Our Lord Jesus Christ took upon Himself the
   sin of His people. And He was given up to evil, that is to say, to all
   the power that evil could put out against Him--first in the wilderness,
   tempted from all quarters, tempted by the temptations of Satan. And
   then in the Garden, tempted in such a way as you and I never were--the
   powers of evil let loose upon Him as they never were upon us! Did He
   not say, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness"? And so
   dreadful was the assault of evil upon Him, the devil going forth as the
   type and incarnation of evil, that He sweat, as it were, great drops of
   blood falling to the ground! And while especially on the tree, where
   the conflict reached its climax, was He given up.

   That cry, "My God! My God! Why have You forsaken Me?" is like the cry
   of the goat when it is given up, quite given up, and led away. Evil was
   permitted to work out in Him all its own dread hatefulness and havoc,
   to which it must bring our spirits, unless God interposes to stop evil
   from making the soul become unutterably wretched, even unto death.

   I do not know how to get out the thought which seems to be in my soul,
   but I do rejoice to think that all the evil I have ever done shall not
   go on to plague and vex me because it has vexed and plagued Him. That
   all the essential misery that lies in my past sin--which must, even if
   God forgave it, still come back to sting and torment me throughout all
   my existence--was so laid on Him and so spent all its force and venom
   on Him who was given up to it, that it will never touch me again!

   You know, Brothers and Sisters, there was no other man who could have
   borne all that power of evil but our Lord. And it all fell on Him and
   yet it never stained His matchless purity and perfection of Character.
   The misery of it came to Him, but the guilt of it could never defile
   Him! The misery of sin spent itself on the lonely One who was given up
   to its awful force, but it could do no more. The type says nothing
   about the scapegoat, whether it died or not, and Christ did not die
   because of the misery of His spirit--He died for quite another reason
   and in another sense--laying down His life for His people!

   There is something, I think, interesting in this if we can carry it
   out, but there is this to be said--by that scapegoat being thus given
   up, the sin of the congregation was taken away--all taken away and all
   gone. And so, through Jesus Christ having borne our sicknesses and
   carried our sorrows, the whole force and power of evil to do damning
   mischief against a saint has been taken away forever from everyone of
   us who have laid our hands, by faith, upon His dear and blessed head.
   It is gone! The sin is gone, gone into the wilderness, where it shall
   never be found against us any more forever.

   I must hasten on, however, for time flies. There was yet a third part
   of this expiation. Did you notice it? It is a grand thing when we can
   see God's honor clear. It is a grand thing, next, when we can see
   ourselves clear as to the effects of evil by Christ's taking evil quite
   away. The third grand thing is to see-- III. SIN, ITSELF, MADE THE
   SUBJECT OF CONTEMPT.

   God cannot dwell with us if sin is petted and loved. Sin must be
   detested and loathed. Now, read on in the Chapter and you will find
   that the bullock and the goat which were there, and whose blood was
   taken into the Holy Place, were afterwards burned outside the camp--see
   the 27th verse. They were burned, and burned with ignominy, burned
   outside the camp in the common sewer, the kennel of the camp--and
   burned, too, under circumstances that imply disgust. "They shall burn
   in the fire, their skins and their flesh, and their dung"--put in
   purposely to show what a contempt was to be put upon the beasts that
   had been, for a while, made to take and to typify sin!

   That burning outside the camp looked to a stranger like the burning of
   a heap of rubbish. There was a foul smell of the burning flesh and
   refuse. Persons, as they passed turned their heads away to avoid the
   terrible odor. They would say, "What is all this?" "Why, this was a
   sin-offering, and when the blood, which God accepted, had gone, this
   was what was left--the filth of sin--and the people were just being
   taught how they should hate, loathe and destroy it! Every man that
   touched it washed himself! And no man could touch any of these things
   that day without bathing again and again, the thing was so detestable!

   Now, in the Person of our blessed Lord, sin is made most detestable.
   Did you ever really hate sin until you learned to love Christ? I will
   ask you when do you hate sin the most? Why, when you love Christ the
   most! I believe you shall always find that in proportion as you
   understand and see the work of Christ, you will see in that work, as in
   a glass, that Christ has made sin to be the most loathsome and
   disgusting thing that was ever heard of, for what do the angels
   say--"Man sinned, did he? Oh, foolish man, to sin against his God and
   his Maker!" "Ah," says one of the angels, "but he did worse than
   that--he sinned against the God that loved him so, that He would sooner
   let His Only-Begotten Son die than poor man should perish!" "Oh," they
   say, "what a shameful thing to sin against so dear and kind a God!" If
   God were a tyrant, it might not seem atrocious to rebel against Him.
   But when He becomes so dear and tender a Father as to give His
   Only-Begotten Son--away with you, Sin! Talk of the Devil! He is not
   black compared with you, O Sin--you are the Devil's tempter, the
   Devil's ruin! You make him black. It is sin, sin that is so foul a
   thing that I can liken it unto nothing! There is nothing on earth,
   there is nothing anywhere in Hell that can be likened unto it! Sin is
   made to appear exceedingly sinful and loathsome to the uttermost degree
   through the Expiatory Sacrifice of Jesus Christ!

   Now, these are three grand things for God to have done in this
   world--after man sinned to have made His name as glorious as ever.
   After man's sin, to have set pardoned man straight, as straight as ever
   from his sin. And after that, to have made sin which came with the
   apple in its hand and which comes every day, now, with painted face,
   and with the cup in its hand, filled to the brim with sweet wine, seem
   hateful and to be really so! Oh, it is a grand work, that which Christ
   has done! Blessed be His name!

   Now, the last point--and I shall need your earnest consideration for a
   minute or two--is this. I must call your attention to--

   IV. THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT DAY in which
   this wonderful panorama was made to pass before them.

   During that day they were to afflict their souls. Do you want to have
   your sin forgiven? Put away your jollity and your mirth. A repenting
   sinner had need to be a mourner and, Brothers and Sisters, when sin is
   put away, how the forgiven sinner afflicts his soul! He is happy! He
   was never more happy! Never so happy, but how grieved he is to think he
   ever sinned!--

   "My sins, my sins my Savior! How sad on You they fall! Seen through
   Your gentle patience, I tenfold feel them all. I know they are
   forgiven, But still their pain to me, Is all the grief and anguish,
   They laid, my Lord, on Thee. My sins, my sins, my Savior! Their guilt
   Inever knew, Till, with You, in the desert, I near Your passion drew.
   Till with You, in the Garden, I heard Your pleading prayer, And saw the
   bloody sweat drops, That told Your sorrow there." Oh, there is never,
   never such affliction of soul for sin as when you see the great
   Atonement! Let me invite you to hate sin, tonight, you pardoned ones.
   Take care to do it. And you unpardoned ones, rend your hearts, but not
   your garments!

   And turn unto God with afflicted spirits and say, "Lord, through the
   precious Atonement of which I have heard so much tonight, blot out my
   sins!"

   The next thing concerning the people that day was that they were to do
   no servile work on that day. There was to be no hewing of wood, no
   drawing of water--nothing was to be done throughout all the camp by way
   of labor. So, when a soul comes to the Atonement of Christ, it has done
   with all its works of righteousness and all its deeds of human merit!
   You can never have the Atonement of Christ while you are working out
   your own works and trying to be saved by them. And the Believer that
   has once come to take Christ to be his Savior will never try to get any
   merits of his own. Oh, he has thrown away forever the fooleries of
   self-righteousness! He sees the absurdity of hoping that foul, black
   hands can ever present a fair, white sacrifice to God. He takes his
   lord and he has done with his own doings!

   Once more--it was to be to the people a Sabbath unto the Lord. That day
   was not the seventh day of the week, but still it was to be a kind of
   Sabbath. And what a glorious Sabbath the Atonement always makes! Why, I
   feel a Sabbath, tonight, apart from the Sabbath Day. I have a Sabbath
   in my soul, to think that the sin of man has not, after all, done
   lasting damage to the Throne of God. I feel so happy to think, next,
   that there is a special sacrifice made for the elect, by the
   scapegoat's having taken away their sin, so that the evil of their sin
   will never come on them. I feel so thankful, tonight, to think that God
   has made sin to appear to be exceedingly sinful. These three grand
   things ring a peal of bells in my soul, for now I feel content--for God
   is satisfied to come to God--and I can see why He should let me come to
   Him.

   I can understand now how it is that He should let a fallen creature
   hold converse with His thrice holy Self after His great work is done!
   And it is better for me, and better for you, that we should come to God
   by so good and reasonable, and proper, and glorious a way--rather than
   that we should have been permitted, had it been possible, to come by
   any breach of the Law, or by any setting aside of the Divine Command.

   I do not think I would have been happy had it been possible for me to
   go to Heaven, and God's honor had thereby been sullied, for God's honor
   is the very happiness of a reconciled creature! And if that had
   suffered any loss through me, I would have been miserable. But it shall
   suffer no loss or stain! Christ has completely undone the mischief of
   the Fall! Glory be to His blessed name for this!

   And now, Beloved in the Lord, I wish that I could speak in the name of
   you all and accept the Man, Christ Jesus, tonight, as our
   representative. Remember, though He has done this much for us all, that
   God can dwell with us, yet He has not taken the sin of us all upon
   Himself, but only of so many as stand and confess their sin and trust
   it with Him. Come, will you do it? Poor Sinner, will you do it for the
   first time tonight? Backslider, will you do it again? You Believers
   that have lost some of your evidences, will you do it anew tonight? Oh,
   I wish I could now say these words and you could all say, "Amen," from
   your hearts--

   "My faith does lay her hand On that dear head of Thine, While, like a
   penitent I stand, And here confess my sin."

   Well, if you won't have Christ for your Savior, I will have Him for
   mine! And there are thousands of you here who will say, "Yes, and He
   shall be mine, too!" The longer I live, the more I love to rest upon
   Him. I did try to rest somewhere else, once, but the dream is over and
   now the more I think of my Lord, the more firm I feel the conviction
   that He is a rock that will bear the weight of my salvation! The more I
   think of what that glorious Man, that blessed Son of God, who is as
   much God as He is Man, has done for me, the more do I feel that if I
   had fifty thousand times the sin I have, I would rest on Him! And if I
   were as wicked as all men put together, I would rest on Him, still,
   believing that no amount of sin could outweigh His merit and that no
   extent of iniquity could ever surpass the infinite bounds of His
   eternal Grace. He is able to save to the uttermost them that come to
   God by Him! Come to God by Him, poor Sinner, and may God the Holy
   Spirit lead you, and He shall have the glory! Amen, and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 6:1-19.

   Paul finishes the last Chapter by saying, "That as sin has reigned unto
   death, even so might Grace reign through righteousness unto eternal
   life by Jesus Christ our Lord." "What shall we say, then?" What
   inference shall we draw from the superabounding of Grace over sin?

   Verse 1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that Grace
   may abound?'"Shall we continue in sin, that Grace may abound?" That
   were a very horrible inference! It is one great instance of the
   shocking depravity of man that the inference has sometimes been drawn!
   I hope not often, for surely Satan, himself, might scarcely draw an
   inference of licentiousness from love. Still, some have drawn it.

   2. God forbid! How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
   therein?Now he goes on by an argument to prove that those in whom the
   Grace of God has worked the wondrous change cannot possibly choose sin,
   nor live in it.

   3. Knowyou not that so many of us as were baptizedinto Jesus Christ
   were baptized into His death?That is the very hinge of our religion!
   His death, not into His example, merely, nor primarily into His life,
   but, "into His death." In this we have believed--we are linked with a
   dying Savior and our baptism sets this forth. We "were baptized into
   His death."

   4. Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as
   Christ was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so
   we also should walk in the newness of life. The operations, therefore,
   of the Spirit of God forbid that a saved man should live in sin. He is
   dead. He is raised into newness of life. At the very entrance into the
   Church, in the very act of Baptism, he declares that he cannot live as
   he once did, for he is dead! He declares that he must live after
   another fashion, for has he not been raised again in the type and
   raised again in very deed from the dead?

   5. 6. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His
   death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection. Knowing
   this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin
   might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. A death
   has taken place in us and though there are relics of corruption still
   alive, yet they are crucified--they will have to die, they must
   die--they are nailed fast to the Cross to die in union with the death
   of Christ!

   7. For he that is dead is freed from sin. The man is dead. The law
   cannot ask more of a criminal than to yield his life. If, therefore, he
   should live again after death, he would not be one who could suffer for
   his past offenses. They were committed in another life and, "he that is
   dead is freed from sin."

   8, 9. Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
   live with Him. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no
   more; death has no more dominion over Him. Or death will have dominion
   over Him no more-- He will never come a second time under death, and
   neither shall His people. "For in that He died, He died unto sin once."
   There was an end of it in the sense of once and for all--no second
   death for Christ.

   10-12. For in that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He lives
   unto God. Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead, indeed, unto
   sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin,
   therefore, reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the
   lusts thereof'Perhaps there were some who would say that in their
   spirits, truth and righteousness were supreme, but that in their bodies
   sin had the mastery. Yes, but that will not do. There must be left no
   lurking piece for sin within the complete system of our manhood--it
   must be hunted out and hunted down thoroughly--out of the body as well
   as out of the mind!

   13. Neither yield you your members as instrument of unrighteousness
   unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from
   the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God We
   do not, I think, make enough of the passive part of our religion. We
   are often for doing and quite right, too, and the more active we can be
   the better! Still, before the doing there must come a yielding because
   we remember who it is that works in us, "both to will and to do of His
   own good pleasure," and our activities, after all are not so much our
   own as we deem, if they are right. They are the activities of the
   Divine Life within us--of the Spirit of God, Himself, working in us to
   the Glory of the Father! One great point, therefore, is to yield
   ourselves up--our members to be weapons in God's hands for the fighting
   of the spiritual war.

   14. For sin shall not have domination over you: for you are not under
   the Law, but under Grace. The reigning, ruling principle, now, is not,
   "You must, you shall," for reward or under fear of punishment! But God
   has loved you and now you love Him in return and what you do springs
   from no mercenary or self-serving motive! You are not under Law, but
   under Grace. Yet in another sense you never were so much under Law as
   you are now, for Grace puts about you a blessedly sweet, delightful Law
   which has power over us as the word of command never had. "I will write
   My Law intheir hearts, in their inward parts will I write them." Yes,
   that is the glory of the new life, the delight of him who has passed
   from death unto life!

   15. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the Law, but under
   Grace? Oh, this old question keeps coming up! Somebody wants to sin.
   Well, if he wants to sin, why does he not leave this business alone and
   go and sin? What has he to do with these theological questions at all?
   But still, he wants, if he can, to make a coverlet for his wickedness!
   He wants to enjoy the sweets of the child of God and yet live like an
   enemy of God--and so he pops in his head over and over again--"May we
   not sin because of this, or that?" To which the Apostle answers again,
   "God forbid!" Oh, may God always forbid it to you and to me! May the
   question never be tolerated among us!

   15, 16. God forbid! Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves
   servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin
   unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?If you are doing the
   deeds of sin, you are the servants of sin and only as you are doing the
   will of God can you claim to be the servant of God! "Hereby we know
   that we know Him, if we keep His commandments." That becomes the index
   of our condition. The man, then, that lives in sin and loves it, need
   not talk about the Grace of God--he is a stranger to it, for the mark
   of those that come under Grace is this--that they serve God and no
   longer serve sin!

   17, 18. But God be thanked, thatyou were the servants ofsin, butyou
   have obeyed from the heart that form ofDoc-trine which was delivered
   you. Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of
   righteousness. "Bondservants," you have got in our new translation, for
   so it was, and the Apostle seems to excuse himself for using such a
   word by saying--

   19. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
   flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
   to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
   righteousness unto holi-ness.As you submitted yourselves to sin most
   cheerfully and voluntarily, and yet were slaves under it, so now come
   and be slaves under Christ with most blessed cheerfulness and delight!
   Endeavor to lose your very wills in His will, for no man's slavery is
   so complete as his who even yields his will. Now, yield everything to
   Christ! You shall never be so free as when you do that--never so
   blessedly delivered from all bondage as when you absolutely and
   completely yield yourselves up to the power and supremacy of your Lord!

Sharing Christ's Life

   (No. 3401)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   DECEMBER 1, 1867.

   "Yet a little while, and the world will see Me no more; but you will
   see Me. Because I live, you shall live also." John 14:19.

   THIS was and is the mark of the true Believer--that he sees Jesus. When
   Jesus was here among men, the world saw Him in a certain sense, but yet
   in truth it did not see Him at all. The world's eyes saw the outside of
   Christ--the flesh of the Man, Christ, but the true Christ the ungodly
   eyes could not discern. They could not perceive those wonderful
   attributes of Character, those delightful graces and charms which made
   up the true spiritual Christ. They saw but the husk, and not the
   kernel. They saw the quartz of the golden nugget, but not the pure gold
   which that quartz contained. They saw but the external Man--the real,
   spiritual Christ they could not see. But unto as many as God had
   chosen, Christ manifested Himself as He did not unto the world! There
   were some to whom He said, "The world sees Me not, but you see Me."
   Some there were whose eyes were anointed with the heavenly salve, so
   that they saw in "the Man, Christ Jesus," the God, the glorious Savior,
   the King-of-kings, The Wonderful, The Counselor, The Mighty God, The
   Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace!

   The blind world said of Him that He was a root out of a dry ground. And
   when they saw Him there was no beauty in Him that they should desire
   Him. He was despised and rejected of men. But God's elect were men who
   saw Him as God over all, blessed forever, descending to tabernacle
   among men and to take upon Himself man's imperfect nature, so that He
   might redeem him from all iniquity and save him.

   Now, to this hour, this is the mark of the true Christian. This is to
   be of the elect! This is the very badge and symbol of the
   faithful--they see Jesus. They look beyond the clouds. Other men see
   the cloud and the darkness and they know not what it is. But these men
   with more than eagle eyes, pierce through the clouds of mere sensual
   impressions and see the Glory that was always His, even the Glory of
   the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and truth. Beloved, have
   you ever seen Jesus with the eyes of faith? Have you ever perceived the
   glory of His Person and the beauty of His Character? Have you so
   perceived Jesus as to trust in Him? Have you been so enamored of Him as
   to have yielded yourselves to be His servants forever? Do you take up
   His Cross? Do you avow yourselves to be His followers, come what may?
   If so, then you are saved! But if you see not Christ with your spirit,
   neither do you know Him, nor shall you enjoy a portion with Him.

   Blessed be God, there is this to be said--that he who has once seen
   Christ, shall always see Him! The eyes may sometimes gather dimness,
   but the Light of God shall yet return. Where Christ has opened blind
   eyes, blindness comes not back again! He takes the cataract totally
   away. He does not give a transient gleam of spiritual sight and then
   permit the soul to go back into the darkness of its grave--the sight
   which He gives is the sight of things eternal--a sight which shall
   strengthen and grow until at the last, when death shall take away every
   barrier which parts us from the unseen world. We shall know even as we
   are known and see even as we are seen! To see Jesus is Heaven begun!
   And Heaven consummated is but to see Jesus no longer through a glass
   darkly, but face to face--still it is to see Jesus, to behold the King
   in His beauty! This, I say, is the sum and substance of life
   eternal--and it is true life here below.

   And now our Lord, speaking to those who had seen Him, truly seen Him
   and in spiritual recognition, talks to them concerning life. Sometimes
   it is ours to speak to you of death, not necessarily with gloom, for it
   is illuminated with rays of heavenly light to the Christian, but here
   and now we desire to speak of life, the best and most divine life! We
   will forget the raven with its dusky wings and see only the tender,
   gentle dove, bearing for each one of us the olive branch of peace and
   victory.

   We shall speak of life--life of the highest possible degree--not the
   life which gladdens our eyes in the sunlight when we behold the flowers
   of the field opening their cups. This is vegetable life. Nor the life
   of the young lambs as they frisk and caper and dance for very gladness
   in the spring sunbeams. This is but animal life. Nor even the life that
   enables men to think and speak upon common themes of interest and
   perform the ordinary duties of their different callings--this is but
   mental and social life. We reach to something still
   higher--spirituallife--life in Christ Jesus! A life twice-created, a
   life which is grafted and is an advance upon the first life which we
   have when we are born--far surpassing the life of the flesh because
   that shall, by-and-by, expire--this is a life which springs from
   incorruptible seed and which lives forever!

   The text, in talking to us about life, gives us, first, the assurance
   that Jesus lives. It then promises us that Hispeople shall live. And it
   clearly states that there is a link of connection between the two
   things--that because Jesus lives--His people shall live also First,
   then--

   I. JESUS LIVES.

   He always lived. There never was a time when He was not. "Before the
   hills were brought forth I was there," He says. The eternal Wisdom of
   God is from everlasting. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
   was God, and the Word was with God. The same was in the beginning with
   God." The life, however, which we think is intended in the text, is not
   His Divine life--His life as Deity--but His life as Man, His life as
   Mediator between God and man. In that life He lives! We needed not to
   be assured of His Divine life, but seeing that as a Mediator, He died,
   it was necessary to assure us that as a Mediator He descended into the
   tomb. It is well for us to be assured that as a Mediator He rose again
   from His grave and now lives at the right hand of the Father, no more
   to bleed and die.

   Jesus Christ at this time lives in His proper Manhood. He lives as to
   His soul--His human soul is as it was on earth. He lives as to His
   human body. He is a Man before the Throne of God and I have no doubt
   that He wears the symbol, of course, mightily glorified, of His
   sufferings--

   "Looks like a Lamb that had been slain. And wears His priesthood
   still."

   That very Christ, who did once as a Baby lie upon His mother's breast
   and who, afterwards, trod the waves of Gen-nesaret--who, after His
   resurrection ate a piece of broiled fish and of honeycomb--that very
   Christ is now before the eternal Throne of God! In very soul and body
   the Man, Christ Jesus, is there! He lives!

   He lives a real life. We are so very apt to mystify and becloud
   everything and to suppose that Christ lives by His influence only, or
   lives by His Spirit. Brothers and Sisters, He l ives--the very Man that
   died, as surely as He bled upon the tree, and in His own proper Person,
   from five actual wounds poured out the warm life-torrents of His heart,
   so surely does He actually live at this present moment in the midst of
   unnumbered hearts that sound His praise--the delightful Object of the
   vision of the myriads of spirits who continually adore Him! He actually
   lives! He really and truly lives as He lived here below!

   He lives, also, actively--not in some wondrous sleep of quiet and
   sacred repose. He is as busy, now, as He was when here. He proposed to
   Himself, when He went away, a certain work. "I go to prepare a place
   for you," He said. He is still preparing that place for us. He also
   daily intercedes for His people. Oh, if your faith is strong enough,
   even now you can see Him standing before the Throne of God, pleading
   His glorious merits! I think I see Him now as clearly as ever the Jews
   saw Aaron when he stood with his breastplate on before the Mercy Seat,
   for remember, the Jew never did see Aaron at all there, for the curtain
   was dropped and Aaron was behind the veil. And, therefore, the Jew
   could only see him in his fancy. But I say I see Him as clearly as
   that, for I see my Lord, not by fancy, but by faith! There, where the
   veil is torn in two, so that He is not hidden from my soul's gaze, I
   see Him with my name and yours upon His breast, pleading before

   God!

   Why, gaze awhile and you may think you see Him now! Just as the Jew saw
   Aaron waving the censer, standing between the living and the dead and
   stopping the plague, even so is Christ standing at this hour between
   the living and the dead--and so moving the whole Deity to spare the
   guilty yet a little longer--while He makes intercession for them that
   they may live! And then comes His higher intercession for His elect, of
   whom He says, "I pray for them. I pray not for the world." He lives,
   then, an actual life of which you and I reap the daily fruits! Not a
   life of slumber and stillness, but an active, busy life by which He
   continually dispenses gifts to us!

   For this reason it is well to remind you that, therefore, Jesus can
   only live as a Man in one place. When we speak of Christ being found in
   every assembly of His people, we understand that of His Presence in His
   Godhead and by His Holy Spirit, who rules on earth in this dispensation
   of the Spirit. But the Man, Christ, can be but in one place. And He is
   now at the right hand of the Majesty on high. It is absurd, it is
   horrible both to faith and to reason to say that Christ's body is eaten
   and that His blood is drunk in tens of thousands of places wherever
   priests choose to offer what they call, "the mass!" It is a "mass" of
   profanity, indeed! Our Lord Jesus Christ, as to His real, positive,
   corporeal Presence, is not here. As to His flesh and His blood, He is
   not and cannot be here! He will be here one day--when He shall descend
   from Heaven with a shout, with the trumpet of the archangel and the
   voice of God! But in His real Person, He is now where His saints
   are--before the Throne of God, from where, by-and-by, He will descend.
   Meanwhile, His spiritual Presence is our joy and our gladness, but His
   corporeal Presence--a Doctrine which our faith grasps and lays hold
   of--His corporeal presence is before the Throne of God and there He
   lives in proper flesh and blood as the Son of Man.

   Brothers and Sisters, listen to a brief sketch of the biography of
   Christ's life in Glory. When the holy women and godly men wrapped Him
   in spices and laid Him in the tomb, Jesus was dead. There for parts of
   three days and nights He tarried. He saw no corruption, but yet He was
   in the place of corruption. No worm could assail that Holy Thing which
   no sin had tainted--and yet He laid in the place where death seemed
   sovereign. A while He slept, and the Church mourned, but blessed was
   the day when, at the first rosy dawn of light, the Savior rose!

   Then could He say, "I live." His body, instinct with life, rose from
   its slumber and began at once to put off the grave clothes. He unwound
   the winding-sheets and the fine white linen and laid them carefully
   down. And He left them there for you and me, that we might have our bed
   well sheeted when we come to lie in it at the last.

   As for the napkin, He unwound it and laid it by itself, as though that
   were for us who are living, to wipe our eyes when our dear ones are
   taken away--since we have no cause to sorrow as they do who have no
   hope. And when this was done, an angel rolled away the stone and forth
   came the Savior--glorious, no doubt, but so much like other men that
   Mary "supposed Him to have been the gardener," so that there could have
   been no very supernatural splendor surrounding His Person! He revealed
   Himself to many of His disciples--sometimes to as many as 500 at once.
   He ate with them. He drank with them. He was a Man among men with them,
   till, when 40 days had passed, He gathered them all at Olivet, the
   mountain from which He had so often addressed them, and took His final
   leave. While He was blessing them, His hands outstretched in
   benediction, a cloud received Him out of their sight. And since then He
   has sat down at the right hand of God, expecting till His enemies be
   made His footstool. He is tarrying there yet a little while longer.
   When the fullness of time shall come--if I may go on with His
   biography--He will come again. "This same Jesus," said the angels,
   "which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in a like manner
   as you have seen Him go into Heaven." He will, therefore, come in
   proper Person a second time, without a sin-offering unto salvation.
   Then will He gather His saints together who have made a Covenant with
   Him by sacrifice. Then shall they reign with Him. Then shall the earth
   be covered with His Glory. All nations shall bow before Him and all
   people shall call Him blessed! And then shall come the end, when He
   shall deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, and God shall be
   All-in-All. But Christ shall still live, for He has received a
   priesthood after the order of Melchisedec, without beginning of days,
   or end of years--a priest forever. When suns and moons shall grow dim
   with age and the round world shall all dissolve like the morning
   hoar-frost, and time shall be rolled up like a vesture, and all the
   ages shall have been trodden out like sparks beneath the foot of the
   Eternal God, then shall Jesus Christ still live on, world without end!
   Thus have we spoken concerning Christ as living. But now, in the next
   place--

   II. LIFE IS PROMISED TO CHRIST'S PEOPLE.

   This does not mean their natural existence. They have received that
   from Adam and, through their sin, it has become a curse to them rather
   than a blessing. Should they remain unpardoned, the fact of continued
   existence will become to them the most dreadful of calamities since it
   must be an existence in God's holy abhorrence of sin forever--driven
   from every glimpse or hope of forgiveness!

   The life which comes to us through Christ is of this sort--I trust you
   know it in your own hearts--it is spirituallife, given to us in
   regeneration. When the Holy Spirit quickens a dead soul, that dead soul
   then receives the life of Christ! No man is alive unto God,
   spiritually, except through Christ. Because Christ lives, we live. When
   a dead soul gets into living contact with the living Savior by the
   power of the Spirit, then it is, that spiritual life begins. The very
   first evidence of spiritual life is trusting in Jesus, which shows that
   as the first symptom is alliance to Christ, the cause of the life must
   be somewhere here, namely--union with Christ! One of the very first
   outward signs is prayer--prayer to Christ and that, again, rises from
   the fact that Christ gives us of His life--and then that life goes back
   again to Him. Brothers, if you seek the life of other souls and desire
   to see them brought to God, preach Christ to them! Do you not see,
   "Because I live, you shall live"? Then no sinner will ever live
   spiritually apart from Christ! Though you and I cannot quicken them,
   yet we can preach the Gospel to them--and faith comes by hearing! And
   where faith is, there is life. It is no use trying to raise the dead by
   preaching the Law of God to them. That is only covering them up fairly
   with a lie in their right hand--but to preach of dying love and of
   rising power, to tell of pardons bought with blood and to declare that
   Christ died a Substitute for sinners--this is the hopeful way of
   bringing life to the dead! It is by such instrumentality that souls are
   brought to eternal life. Because Christ is alive, His elect, in due
   time, receive spiritual life by the power of the Holy Spirit and,
   although once they were dead in sin, they begin to live unto
   righteousness!

   Further, this spiritual life is preserved in us by Christ still living.
   "Because I continue to live, you shall continue to live also." The text
   clearly means that--it bears that paraphrase. Oh, dear Friends, when we
   once get spiritual life into us, what a thousand enemies there are who
   try to put it out! Many and many a time has it seemed to go hard with
   my soul as to whether I really had a spark of life within my spirit.
   Temptation after temptation have I endured until it appeared as if I
   must yield my hold on Christ and give up my hope! There has been
   conflict upon conflict, and struggle upon struggle until, at last, the
   enemy has got his foot upon my neck and my whole being has trembled!
   And had it not been for Christ's promise, "Because I live, you shall
   live also," it might have gone harder with me and I might have
   despaired and given up all hope--and laid down to die. The assurance,
   then, that the spiritual life of the Christian must be maintained
   because Christ lives, was the only power to get me the victory! Let it
   teach us, then, this practical lesson. Whenever our spiritual life is
   very weak and we need it to grow stronger, let us get to the living
   Christ for the supply of His strength! When you feel you are ready to
   die, spiritually, go to the Savior for revived life. The text is like a
   hand that points us to the storehouse. You who are in the desert, there
   is a secret spring under your feet, and you know not where it is--this
   is the mysterious finger which points you to the spot! Contemplate
   Christ! Believe in Christ! Draw yourselves by faith nearer and nearer
   to the Lord Jesus Christ and so shall your life receive a Divine
   impetus which it has not known for many a day."Because I live, you
   shall live also."

   And further, Brothers and Sisters, we get from Christ an educated life.
   Any man may be spiritually alive and yet he may not know much about the
   higher life. There is, in spiritual life, a scale of degrees. One man
   is just alive unto God. Another man may be active and vigorous. Another
   may be rapturously consecrated. I hope you and I will anxiously desire
   to get the highest form of spiritual life that is known! We do not wish
   to be beggars in the Kingdom of Christ, but if we can, to take our
   place in the House of Peers--to be princes through Jesus Christ. We
   need not be poor--Christ is willing to enrich us. We are not straitened
   in Him--we are straitened in ourselves. Now, Christ gives the promise,
   "Because I live," He says, "the highest life, far above all
   principalities and powers--you shall also live this higher life with
   Me." You may have it! You may obtain it, but Brothers and Sisters, if
   you want to get it, never go to Moses for it! Never go to yourselves
   for it. Do not seek to school yourselves by rules, regulations and
   resolutions, or by a morbid asceticism such as some men delight in! But
   go to the living Savior and in the living liberty which you will enjoy
   in communion with Him, your soul will take unto itself, wings, and
   mount into a clearer atmosphere! Your spirit will be braced to a higher
   degree of robust devotion! You will draw nearer to Heaven because you
   have got nearer to Christ, who is the Lord of Heaven! "Because I live,
   you shall have life: you shall have that life continued and you shall
   have that life yet more abundantly. I am come not only that you may
   have life, but more abundantly." These are your Master's words! Plead
   them before your Master's Throne!

   And now, Brothers and Sisters, we will go a little further. We will
   suppose that you are well acquainted with these forms of life, but now
   there comes a jerk, as it were. You are travelling along the iron road
   of the railway and there comes a sudden jerk and you stop. What is it?
   It is the thought of death! Well, but Jesus tells us, here, that that
   is of no consequence! It is an item in the great world of life that to
   you who are in Him is scarcely worth consideration because the text
   overrides that and swallows it up! As it is written "death is swallowed
   up in victory"--it is made as though it did not exist! "Because I live,
   you shall live also." Your continued life of happiness, of holiness, of
   spirituality, of consecration and of obedience--which, indeed, is your
   only life worth having--is guaranteed to you in the text! Death
   cannotinterfere with it, not even by the space of a single second! No,
   I tell you not even by the space of the ticking of a clock! What? A
   Christian die? "Because I live, you shall live also," is never
   suspended! There is no time for it to be suspended. Do you know what
   death really is? Does it take long to die? I have heard of men who have
   been said to be weeks in dying. Not so! They were weeks living--the
   dying occupied no space--that was done at once and immediately. And so
   with the Believer. To him death is so slight a jerk that he still keeps
   on upon the same line! He still lives, only there is this difference,
   that it is as though the railway had been running through a tunnel and
   he now comes out of it into the open plain. His life below was the
   train in the tunnel, but when he dies, as we call it, there is a jerk
   and then it comes right out of the tunnel into the fair, open, plain
   country of Heaven where all is clear and bright! Where all the birds
   are singing and the darkness is over, the mist and fogs are gone and
   his soul is forever blessed! "Because I live a life that cannot be
   suspended," Christ seems to say, "you shall live also."

   At the bottom of every man's heart there is, I suppose, a fear of
   ceasing to be. Some infidels seem to find comfort in the thought of
   being annihilated, but that thought is, perhaps, the most abhorrent
   that ever crossed the human mind! There is a something within us that
   tells us we are immortal, or there is, at any rate, something which
   makes us hope we are, but we shrink with loathing from the idea of
   being annihilated! Now, at that point comes in our text and it says,
   "What? Annihilated? You who believe in Jesus cannot be! You shall live
   also, live with that higher life which you have received--a life of
   beauty, a life of excellence, of holiness and of God-likeness! That new
   life implanted within you shall never be suspended." No, never by the
   space of a single tick, for, "Because I live, you shall live also."

   Further, Brothers and Sisters, our text is such a wide one that we have
   a hold of the fact that we are to continue to live as to our spirits
   and our souls. The text, beneath its sheltering wings, like a hen
   gathering her brood, gathers many precious Truths of God. The next one
   is that this very body of ours is to live, too. It must take its time
   for that. It must abide in the earth, whereon it has dwelt. It is so
   decreed that there it should lie unless Christ should come before that
   time. But concerning this very body, there is no decree of
   annihilation. It will smolder away. It may be taken up by the spade of
   the careless sexton and all the atoms of the body be scattered to the
   winds of Heaven! But there is a life-germ within it which no human
   power can destroy, and over which the Divine eyes perpetually
   watch--and when that mysterious and long-expected sound of the angelic
   trumpet shall ring over land and sea, through Heaven and earth, and the
   graves shall all be opened, then shall my soul find my body yet
   again--fashioned after a more beautiful form, more fit for the spirit
   than before! More elastic, altogether free from weakness, no longer
   such as shall be subject to pain, sickness, accident, decay, to
   ultimate corruption--but a spiritual body, raised in power, in glory
   and in immortality! Not raised in the likeness of the first Adam in the
   Garden, but in the likeness of the Second Adam in the everlasting
   Paradise of God!

   Courage my eyes, courage! You shall be closed for a while, but you
   shall see the Redeemer when He stands a second time upon the earth.
   Courage, my fingers and my hands! You must, for a time, lie still and
   motionless, but you shall not be so forever, for you, even you, shall
   strike the strings of those celestial harps that pour forth His praise!
   Courage, all you members of my body which have been sanctified to be
   members of Christ and made to be parts of the Holy Spirit's Temple--you
   shall all take your part in the grand triumphal entry of Christ when He
   shall descend to take possession of His Kingdom! "Though worms destroy
   this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall behold for
   myself and not another." So go to your bed in the earth, poor body, and
   sleep there awhile. Bathe yourself like her who bathed herself in
   spices to make herself ready for the King--so go and get yourself
   prepared to meet your Lord! Take off your workday dress and put on your
   Sabbath garments, your bridal array and then shall you come to the King
   and see Him in His beauty, and crown Him with the crown wherewith His
   mother crowned Him in the days of His espousals. Yes, because He lives
   in the body which He bore, this body shall live again also.

   And so, Beloved, the text amounts to this, that in body and soul the
   Christian shall be immortal like his Master! When our reign on
   earth--whether it shall last a thousand years, or a thousand ages--(we
   know not what the Word of God intends)--but when that glorified state
   on earth which I do most assuredly believe in, shall be over, and it
   shall be said--

   "Now Jehovah's banner's furled, Sheathed His sword because 'tis
   done"--when the drama of the mediatorial reign shall all be closed and
   we shall dwell under the immediate Sovereignty of God once again, then,
   Beloved, every Believer shall be with Christ, eternally glorified, for
   here stands the irrevocable decreeand the Divine mandate of Creation's
   Lord, who is also the redeeming Lamb, "Because I live, you shall live
   also." Reel, you pillars of earth! Be shaken, you arches of the starry
   heavens! Pass away, O Time, and you, you rolling worlds, dissolve into
   your native nothingness! But the Believer must live on because Jesus
   lives! And until the Lord's Christ can bow His head. Until He who only
   has immortality can expire. Until God, Himself, can cease to be, no
   soul that believed in Jesus can lose the incorruptible Life which God's
   own Spirit has put within it!

   I want to sing, Brothers and Sisters, rather than to talk with you.
   These are words and thoughts fit for some ancient bard, or for the
   spirit of some Inspired Prophet sent from Heaven! I do but lisp where
   even seraphs might find their loudest songs fail in the theme. Let your
   hearts mount! Let your souls exult! Let your spirits be glad! Do you

   "Long for evening to undress, That you may rest with God,"and enter
   into His Heaven? Do you long for the evening of death when your toil
   shall be over and the hour of your bliss shall have come? I shall have
   no time, I fear, for the third and last point, and, therefore, must
   only give a few hints of what I would have said.

   III. THIS LIFE IS LINKED WITH CHRIST'S LIFE.

   Immortal, all glorious, promised to true Believers, it is bound up with
   the life of our immortal Lord. Why is this? First, because Christ leads
   a justified life. I scarcely know how to express my meaning. You
   understand that so long as Jesus was here, He lay under the charge of
   our sins. While He was in the world, His Father had made to meet upon
   Him the iniquity of us all. But when He died, His death discharged all
   the liabilities of His elect. The handwriting of ordinances that was
   against us, was then taken away. When He went to Calvary as our Surety,
   the sins of all His people were His debts--He had taken them upon
   Himself. But when He rose from the dead in the garden that first Easter
   morning He had no debts of ours! He had no longer any substitutional
   engagement or liability! All the debts which He had taken upon Himself
   as our Redeemer, He had fully and completely discharged. No officer can
   arrest a man for debt who has none, and Christ now lives, therefore, as
   a justified Person. And Brothers and Sisters, no officer of Justice can
   arrest any of the people for whom Christ paid their debts! How, then,
   shall death have any dominion over those whose debts are all
   discharged? How shall they be laid in prison for whom Christ was laid
   in prison? How shall they suffer death, which is the penalty of sin,
   for whom Christ has already suffered all the penalties which Justice
   could have demanded? Because He lives the life of One who has
   discharged the debts of His people, they must, in Justice, live!

   Secondly, Christ lives a representative life. He is no longer Christ
   for Himself. As the Member of Parliament represents a town, so Jesus
   Christ represents all the people who are in Him. And as long as He
   lives, they live. He is their Covenant Head. As long as Adam stands,
   his race shall stand. When Adam falls, the human race falls. While,
   therefore, Christ lives, the Christly ones who are in Him, live through
   His representation.

   In the next place, Christ lives a perfect life. Perhaps you do not see
   how this is a link between His living and your living, but it is,
   because we are a part of Christ. According to the Word of Scripture,
   every Believer is a member of Christ's body. Now, a man who lives
   perfectly has not lost his finger, or his arm, or his hand. A man may
   be alive with many of his limbs taken away, but you can scarcely call
   him a perfect living man. But I cannot imagine a maimed Christ. I have
   never been able to conceive in my soul, of Christ lacking any of His
   members! Such a thing was never seen on earth. The barbarous cruelty of
   the Jews could not effect that and, by the Providence of God, Pilate's
   officers were not permitted to cause such a thing. "Not a bone of Him
   shall be broken," was the ancient prophecy. They broke the legs of the
   first and second thief, but when they came to the matchless Lord, they
   saw He was already dead, so they broke not His legs. Even in His
   earthly body, which was the type of His spiritual body, He must suffer
   no maiming injury! Therefore, my Brothers and Sisters, because Christ
   lives as a perfect Christ, everyone that is one with Him must live
   also!

   Then, fourthly, Christ lives a blessed life--a life of perfect
   blessedness and, therefore, we must live also. "Why?" you say. Why,
   look--there is a mother here. She is alive. She is in good health, but
   she is not perfectly happy, for she is a Rachel weeping for her
   children and will not be comforted because they are not! Time will heal
   her wounds, it is true, for the most affectionate heart cannot be
   always mourning, but our Lord Jesus Christ, in that Infinitely
   affectionate heart of His, would not only mourn over one of His
   children, if lost, but He would mourn forever over it! I cannot
   conceive of Christ being happy and losing one of His dear children! I
   cannot conceive Christ to be personally blessed and yet one of the
   members of His own Person cast into the "outer darkness." Because He
   lives in perfect happiness, I conceive that allwho are dear to Him will
   be round about Him! It shall not be said that He lost one of them, nor
   shall one of the family be missing, but--

   "All the chosen seed Shall meet around the Throne To bless the conduct
   of His Grace And make His wonders known!"

   And lastly, Christ leads a triumphant life and, therefore, you shall
   live also! You say again, "How is that?" Why, Brothers and Sisters, the
   triumph of Christ concerns us! This is the triumph of Christ, "Of all
   those whom You have given Me, I have lost none." Now, suppose there to
   be heard a whisper from the infernal Pit, "Aha! Aha! You lie! There is
   one here whom the Father gave You, but whom You did lose"? Why, Christ
   would never be able to speak again by way of triumph! He could never
   boast anymore! Then might He put down His crown! If it were but to
   happen in that one case, at any rate, the enemy would have got the
   advantage over Him and He would not have been the Conqueror all along
   the line. But, glory be to God! He who trod the winepress with none for
   His assistant, came forth out of the crimson conflict, having smitten
   all His foes and won a complete victory! There shall not be in the
   whole campaign a single point over which Satan shall be able to boast!

   Christ has brought many sons to glory as the Captain of their salvation
   and never yet has He failed! And He never shall in any point, neither
   the least nor the greatest, neither the strongest nor the weakest. This
   is essential, dear Friends. It is essential to the acclamations of
   Heaven that every soul that believes in Jesus should live forever. It
   is essential to the everlasting harmony and to the joy of Christ
   throughout eternity, that all who trust in Him should be preserved and
   kept safe, even until the end. Therefore, says the text, "Because I
   live, you shall live also." So I leave this Truth of God with you, only
   praying that those who have no part in this matter may seek Christ at
   this very time--and be led by the Spirit to cry mightily to Him--and
   His promise is, "They that seek Me early shall find Me." Seek you the
   Lord while He may be found. Call you upon Him while He is near."

   God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Nail in a Sure Place

   (No. 3402)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place, and he shall be for a
   glorious throne to his father's house. And they shall hang upon him all
   the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all
   vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the
   vessels of flagons. In that day, says the Lord of Hosts, shall the nail
   that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall;
   and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the Lord has
   spoken it." Isaiah 22:23-25.

   WE have read, in your hearing, the occasion of these words. Shebna the
   scribe, having become proud and vainglorious, was to be put away and
   his place to be occupied by a better man on whom God promised to
   establish His favor. When Shebna the scribe was put away, it was like
   the drawing out of a nail which, apparently, had been well fastened,
   and all that had been hanging upon it came down with its fall. Thus did
   Shebna's family suffer for his sin. It is just so in the world at this
   day. It were well if some men who have gone into evil ways had
   considered this. It is not they, alone, who suffer. Such is the order
   and constitution of the commonwealth of manhood, that when the husband
   sins, the household must feel much of the smart. Oftentimes, for wife
   and children, there has been wrung out a cup of bitterness, of which
   they have been made to drink, not through their own fault, but through
   the fault of the head of the family. Should there be any men here who
   have strayed into this house, tonight, who contemplate putting forth
   his hand to that which is not good, though he might dare to risk the
   consequences for his own sake, yet, for the sake of the children of his
   loins and the wife of his bosom, let him pause lest, perhaps, he fill
   their lives with bitterness, or send them to their graves prematurely
   in poverty and shame.

   That is not, however the subject upon which I shall talk at this time.
   When Shebna was removed, there was room for Eliakim. Let this furnish
   the key to a spiritual lesson. It has been generally propounded and
   admitted by commentators and expositors that Eliakim is a type of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. While this passage literally refers to Eliakim,
   himself, it may, with very great instructiveness, be used as applicable
   to the Lord Jesus--and so I use it. The first point will be this--

   I. IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR JESUS CHRIST, THERE MUST BE AN OVERTHROW
   OF SOMEBODY ELSE, just as in order to make room for Eliakim, Shebna,
   who seemed to be like a nail fastened in a sure place, must be pulled
   out and there must be a downfall of his glory.

   Beloved, whenever Jesus Christ comes into the heart, before He rides in
   state into the Castle of Mansoul, there is a battle, a strife, a
   struggle, a casting down of the image of sin, and a setting up of the
   Cross in its place. All men, by nature, have some kind of
   righteousness. There is no man so vile but he still wraps himself up in
   his rags and cajoles himself into the belief that he has some degree of
   excellence, spiritual or moral. Before Christ can come into the heart,
   all this natural excellence must be torn to shreds. Every single stone
   of the wall upon which we have built before, must come down, and the
   foundations must be utterly destroyed before we shall ever build right
   and for eternity upon the Cornerstone of Christ Jesus. All our conceit
   about our past righteousnesses must be completely overthrown. Perhaps
   we flatter ourselves that all is well because we have been baptized or
   have come to the Communion, like one who was visited, a few days ago,
   by an Elder. Seeing that she was sick and ,near to die, he asked her,
   "Have you a good hope?" "Oh, Sir, yes! A good and blessed hope." "And
   pray," he asked, "what is it?" "Well," she said, "I have taken the
   Sacrament regularly for 50 years." What do you think of that in a
   Christian country, from the lips of one who had attended a Gospel
   ministry? Her confidence was built upon the mere fact of her having
   attended to an outward ceremony to which, probably, she had no right
   whatever! There are hundreds and thousands who are thus resting upon
   mere ceremonies! They have been Church-goers or Chapel-goers from their
   youth up. They have never been absent, except under sickness, from
   their regular place of worship. Good easy souls! Are these the boats
   upon which they hope to swim in eternity? They will surely sink to
   their everlasting destruction! Some base their confidence on the fact
   that they have never indulged in the grosser vices. Others that they
   have been scrupulously honest in their commercial transactions. Some
   that they have been good husbands. Others that they have been
   charitable neighbors. I know not of what poor flimsy tissue men will
   not make a covering to hide their natural nakedness! But all this must
   be unraveled--every stitch of it! No man can put on the robes of
   Christ's righteousness till he has taken off his own. Christ will never
   go shares in our salvation. God will not have it said that He partly
   made the heavens, but that some other spirit came in to conclude the
   gigantic work of Creation, much less will He divide the work of our
   salvation with any other! He must be the only Savior as He was the only
   Creator! In the winepress of His sufferings, Jesus stood alone--of the
   people, none were with Him--no angel could assist Him in the mighty
   work. In the fight He stood alone--the solitary Champion, the sole
   Victor! So, too, you must be saved by Him, alone, resting entirely on
   Him and counting your own righteousness to be dross and dung, or else
   you can never be saved at all! It must be down with Shebna, or else it
   cannot be up with Eliakim! It must be down with self, or it can never
   be up with Christ! Self-righteousness must be set aside to make room
   for the righteousness of Jesus--otherwise it can never be ours.

   We must, with equal thoroughness, be ready to give up all confidence in
   our own resolutions, or vows, or endeavors for the future and come to
   rest the future where we rest the past--on Christ, and Christ alone. I
   know it is the idea of many that albeit they have slipped and fallen in
   the past, yet they shall be able to stand upright in the future. Have
   they not resolved it? Can they not do it? Are they not able to do as
   they will? As they have had much ability for evil, have they not an
   equal ability for good? So self-sufficiency talks. But when a man comes
   to know himself, and to know Christ, he sings another note. "Ah," said
   an aged saint, as he heard of men that were taken to the police
   station, and of some that were condemned to die, and others that were
   transported--"Ah," said he, "he today, I tomorrow if the Grace of God
   did not prevent." So every truly humbled man will say, when he hears of
   the great offenses of others, "They today, and I tomorrow, unless Grace
   shall intervene to keep me from following their evil example." Brothers
   and Sisters, our only hope for the future lies in this--that those who
   trust Jesus are in Jesus Christ's hands and that He is able to keep
   that which they commit to Him. Those who trust in Jesus have this
   promise that the Holy Spirit shall dwell in them and walk in
   them--writing a law upon their hearts making their hearts new--molding
   their natures into the nature of Christ, causing them to hate evil and
   to choose that which is good. You will never kill a single evil passion
   through your own strivings apart from the precious blood of Christ!
   Those vipers within our bosom will never die till they are sprinkled
   with the blood of the Great Sacrifice--and then they all depart. Jesus
   comes and fills the heart and then evil is crushed beneath His foot and
   is utterly slain, so that Christ becomes fully formed in us the hope of
   Glory!

   Now, it is hard for a man to give up these two things--all glorying in
   the past and all hope for the future in himself. It is hard to be a
   pauper and to knock at Mercy's door and ask for alms, and yet only as
   paupers can we come. I do not allude exclusively to you that have been
   great sinners, outwardly only, but I mean you moral men and women, you
   that are good and excellent in a thousand ways. You must still come,
   just as the poor publican came, with, "God be merciful to me, a
   sinner." These are God's terms and He will accept you on no other. Oh,
   be not proud enough to kick at them, but submit yourself to the
   dictates of Eternal Love and let your vanity and self-opinion be abased
   that Jesus Christ may be All-in-All to you!

   Before I leave this point, let me remark that as this is to be done
   before we come to Christ, so all our life long it is one of the things
   about which we must always be vigilant, for the tendency of human
   nature, as long as we are in this world, is to get something to rest
   upon in ourselves. We can hardly be indulged with the light of
   Jehovah's Countenance before we begin to make a confidence of it--and
   if our graces for a little while bud and bloom like seeming flowers, we
   very soon begin to compliment ourselves upon our imaginary goodness!
   Though every excellence is borrowed, we begin to be proud of it and to
   forget that in Him is all our salvation, and all confidence. This
   knocking down has to be persevered in, for the flesh lusts against the
   Spirit and yet as fast as we can, in our pride build up anything in
   which we can glory, the Lord sends a terrible blast of some kind or
   other against the wall, and sweeps it all down, that Jesus Christ may
   alone be exalted in our experience.

   Thus much upon the first point. There must be a down-throwing, a
   pulling out of one nail before there can be another for us to hang
   upon. Now, let us turn to a second thought, which is this--

   II. THE NATURE OF OUR TRUE DEPENDENCE, as set forth in the words of the
   23rd and 24th verses.

   The reliance of a really saved soul is upon the Person, the work and
   righteousness of Jesus Christ only. This dependence is warranted by
   God's appointment. Turn to the 23rd verse--"Iwill fasten him as a nail
   in a sure place." That other nail, in the 25th verse, God never
   fastened, but this is one that God fastens and what God does, lasts
   forever! Do you, dear Hearer, rest your soul's salvation alone upon
   Jesus? Then, mark you, He can never fail you, for if He did, then would
   it be true that God had been mistaken. It were blasphemy to think it!
   If the Lord appoints Jesus Christ to be a Propitiation for sin, and yet
   He does not make that Propitiation, then there is a mistake somewhere.
   If God bids me lean my whole weight upon His Son, and I do so lean, and
   yet am not sustained, then is there a great mistake, not on my part
   only, but on the part of Infinite Wisdom! But we cannot suppose that.
   The Lord knew what He was doing when He appointed the Only-Begotten to
   be the sinner's pillar of strength, upon which he might lean. He knew
   that Jesus could not fail--that as God, He was all-sufficient. That as
   perfect Man He would not turn aside. That as a bleeding Surety, having
   paid all the debt of our sin upon Calvary, He was able to save to the
   uttermost all them that come unto God by Him. I come into this pulpit
   so continually that it is a place to which I am more accustomed than
   any other in the world! And this is the one cry I am always uttering in
   various shapes and ways--it is this one Truth of God I present with
   unwea-ryingly interest--Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the Cross
   of Calvary, bearing upon Himself the sin of all that trust Him, and for
   all that trust Him, He has made a full Atonement, so that their sins
   are forgiven! Christ has paid their debts, they are free! He was
   punished for them! They cannot be punished. God cannot punish the same
   sin twice! If He punishes Christ, He will not punish any for whom
   Christ died! Now, if these statements were my own invention. Did I
   promulgate it as coming out of my own thoughts, it were worthy of no
   acceptance--but inasmuch as God reveals it in His Word--oh, this is the
   soul and marrow of the Christian religion! Rest on it and if you are
   deceived, were such a thing possible, what a consolation would you have
   in appealing to the proclamation of Divine Mercy as an answer to all
   the terrors that menaced you! But that can never be! Impossible! It is
   the Truth of God, O Sinner! However guilty you may be, believe this
   Truth--that Christ is able to save you--and go and cast yourself on
   Him! Rest on His finished work, and as God is true, He will not, He
   cannot, turn aside from His solemn oath and promise--"He that believes
   in Christ is not condemned, but he that believes not is condemned
   already because he has not believed on the Son of God." The Christian's
   dependence, then, is of Divine appointing.

   Moreover, the Believer's dependence is of God's sustaining, for note,
   "I will fasten Him as a nail in a sure place, and He shall be for a
   glorious throne to His father's house." God ensures the future--that
   Christ shall always be to His people their glory and their defense. You
   know how we like good names to be attached to great compacts. In all
   commercial dealing, especially in large transactions, we like good and
   safe men to trust in, though, indeed, where are they to be found
   now-a-days--since the best of them are sharper than a thorn-edge? Oh,
   Honesty, you are fled, perished, buried years ago, and the very rags
   you once did wear are rotten! But, here, if nowhere else, here in the
   Gospel, we have a name in which we may trust the name of the
   thrice-holy God that cannot lie! And He declares that He will sustain
   His Son as the Savior of His people. Need I urge any rational spirit to
   depend where God pledges His Word? "Let God be true, and every man a
   liar," and if you have God's Word for it, cast yourselves unreservedly
   upon His Word! You shall not find Him fail you! You shall rejoice as in
   Heaven you sing of the faithfulness of the God that spoke and the
   everlasting righteousness with which He fulfils every Word He has
   spoken!

   Further still, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Believer's great
   foundation and confidence, is also the Christian's fountain of glory.
   "He shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house." All his
   father's house was to be ennobled through the ennobling of Eliakim and
   so is the Christian ennobled through the ennobling of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. By nature what are we but despicable? If we consider the
   heavens, the work of God's fingers, we are so minute as not to be
   worthy to be called specks in Creation! If we look at our sinfulness,
   we are reduced still lower in the scale. And if we see our continued
   tendency to fresh sin, we are obliged to say, "Lord, what is man, that
   You are mindful of him at all?" But yet man is an honorable creature
   when he lays hold on Christ! Then he is lifted up and made to have
   dominion over all the works of God's hands. All things are put under
   his feet in the Person of Christ Jesus. There is no honor in the whole
   universe--no, not the honor of the angels, themselves--that can exceed
   the honor that is put upon the man who believes in Jesus Christ. I wish
   we always thought so, for indeed, it is so. In the olden times, when
   one was brought before the magistrate to be accused and adjudged to
   death for his Christianity, he blushed not to avow his soul's
   attachment to his Savior with open face. When they asked him what he
   was, he said, "A Christian." "And what is your name?" He said, "My name
   is Christian." "And what is your occupation?" "My occupation is a
   Christian." "And what is your wealth, whatare your degree and rank?" He
   said, "I am a Christian." And to every question they put, he gave but
   this one answer, "I am a Christian. I am a Christian." All the wealth
   and all the glory of this world are nothing compared with the glory
   that comes to the very meanest man who is really allied to Christ and
   can truly be called a Christian! Lift up your heads, you poor and
   needy! Rejoice, you downtrodden and oppressed, you toiling workers, you
   forgotten ones among the sons of men, for if your destiny is linked
   with the Person of the once crucified, but now exalted Savior, you
   shall partake of His Glory in the day of His appearing and forever be
   sharers of the splendor which eternally shall surround your Lord!

   Here, then, is much to comfort us. He upon whom we depend is divinely
   appointed, divinely sustained, and all His Glory He sheds on us! But
   now, pass on and note that--

   III. THE CHRISTIAN'S WHOLE DEPENDENCE IS PLACED UPON THE LORD JESUS
   CHRIST as declared in the 24th verse. The metaphor is this--There is a
   pin in a palace and upon this there may be hung up suits of armor, or
   whatever else the owner of the palace chooses to put there. But instead
   of that, there are hung golden wine cups and goblets. Some of them are
   small vessels of not much capacity. Others of them are great flagons
   adapted to hold large quantities, but they are all hanging upon this
   bracket--all suspended there as trophies. If the nail is taken out, the
   smaller vessels fall, and so do the larger ones, too, for they all
   equally and alike hang on that nail. Their only support from falling
   and being bruised upon the floor is that one pin which holds them all.
   Such is Christ to all His people! All Christians are not alike
   capacious vessels of Grace. Some can receive much--they are full of
   knowledge, zeal, hope, joy, faith. Others will never be anything but
   little vessels. They have believed, but their faith is mixed with
   unbelief. They "can do but little, they have but few talents, their
   knowledge is obscured, their progress in the Divine Life is but small.
   Still, for all that, they rest on nothing less than Christ. They need
   not rest on anything more and the great ones depend on nothing less
   than Christ, nor can they rest on anything more. The little cup is
   quite as safe, for it hangs on the nail as the flagon does. Truly, one
   might be ambitious to be a flagon, to hold a deeper draught for its
   Lord's pleasure, but the littleness of the tiniest vessel does not
   affect its safety. The safety of all that hang there lies in the
   fastness of the pin, the strength and security of the nail. Not in the
   littleness of the one, nor the greatness of the other is there either
   safety or danger, but all rest on that pin. So is it with the whole
   Church of God. We are all hanging upon the finished work of Jesus
   Christ. If we have served Him well and served Him long, yet we have
   nothing whereof to glory, but we cast all aside, and rest, as helpless
   sinners upon the blessed Savior! If we have but just begun to serve
   Him, and so are babes in Grace, we rest entirely upon Him. If we have
   fallen into sin and have been backsliders, yet still we come again and
   look to His merits that we may be restored. Or if we have lived a
   blameless life through His abundant Grace, yet still, for all that, we
   have no other dependence than the rest of the saints, but entirely,
   solely rest in Jesus! This is very simple Doctrine, expressed in very
   simple talk, but I do wish that somebody had told me this years before
   I heard it, for I always had the notion that I was to be saved by
   something I did, and something I felt. I supposed it was a great
   mystery, a matter that took months and years to solve, and that even
   then, it was attended with imminent risk and that the dreary search for
   this inestimable prize might end in disappointment. Oh, I wish I had
   been told earlier that there was nothing whatever for me to do of
   myself, but simply to come, just as I was, and cast myself upon what
   Christ had done for me, and for sinners like me, and that if I rested
   wholly upon Him, I would be saved from my sins and from the tendency to
   sin--and be made holy in Christ Jesus! Now I feel inclined to state,
   whenever I am talking of it, into the simplest language and the
   shortest sentences, in order that if there should be a lad here, a
   child here, that is seeking salvation, he may not be kept in darkness,
   as I was, month after month, and year after year, trying to know what
   to do to be saved! Man, woman--whoever you may be--what is to save you
   is done! Christ has done it all! The robe you have got to wear in
   Heaven is already spun--you have not got to sit at the loom, working
   away and making a garment with which to cover your sins! The fountain
   in which you have to be washed you have not got to fill, nor even to
   drop a tear into it to make it perfect! There it is--filled with blood
   drawn from Immanuel's veins, and all you have to do is but to step into
   it by simply trusting it. Trust Christ! Rely on Christ! Depend on
   Christ and it is done! And you are saved! The flagons and the cups put
   on the nail are safe there. You that put on Jesus Christ now are safe,
   now, safe tonight, safe all your life and safe in Glory everlasting!

   Now, I should like to ask a question of two or three classes, and then
   send you home. There are a great many of us here tonight who are
   teachers of others. Some of you are deacons, Elders, Sunday school
   teachers, street preachers. I thank God that you are a busy people and
   you are doing much for Christ. There is a question I want to ask of
   you, and of myself--Are we who teach others sure that we have believed
   in Christ, ourselves? Are we quite, quite sure that we are saved? It is
   well to ask that question! It is a very dangerous thing, indeed, for an
   unsaved man to begin to work for Christ, for the probabilities are that
   he will take for granted what he ought diligently to have proved. In
   many cases he neverwill seek to be saved, but go on, on, on, never
   pausing to examine himself and so, while professing to work for God, he
   may be a stranger to the work of God on himself! There is an old story
   I recollect reading somewhere of a lunatic in an asylum, who one day
   saw a very lean cook. Accosting him, he said, "Cook, do you make good
   food?" "Yes," said the cook. "Are you sure?" "Yes." "And does anybody
   get fat on it?" "Yes," again was the reply. "Then," said the man, "you
   had better mind what you are after, or else when the governor comes
   round, he will put you in along with me, for if you make good food, and
   yet are so thin yourself, you must be mad, for you do not eat it, or
   else you would get fat, too!" There is some sense in that. You teach
   others, you say you give them spiritual food, but why not feed on it
   yourselves? Master, what right have you to teach if you will not first
   learn? Physician, physician, heal yourself! Brother, it will go hard
   with you and with me if we are lost. What will become of us teachers of
   others if, after having led others to the river, we never drink--after
   bringing others the heavenly food, we perish of spiritual famine
   ourselves? I cannot go round to all the members of this Church and all
   the workers, and take them by the hand and say, "My dear Brother or
   Sister, be not deceived and do not go on deceiving us." But I sometimes
   wish I could do that, and I wish you would take it as done tonight, for
   there are some awful hypocrites among us! There are some who come in
   and apparently behave right well, who are nothing better than
   abominable hypocrites, rotten through and through! And yet in our
   charity we never suspect them, and if we occasionally discover one, we
   stand amazed and say, "Lord, shall I be the next to be a Judas and
   betray my Master?" There never was a Church in which such hypocrites
   have not at all times been exposed to view unless they were all in the
   gall of bitterness together, dead in an empty profession. And then it
   is no marvel that there should be little inclination to exercise
   discipline. Christ's twelve had a Judas, and all churches must expect
   to find the chaff that must be driven away into the fire when the wheat
   is purged by the great Master's fan. I do beseech you, my dear Brothers
   and Sisters, let not membership with this Church, or any other Church,
   assist you in self-delusion, but do--oh, how shall I put it, how shall
   I put it?--do, before you think about the conversion of other people,
   see to it that your own conversion is accomplished! Count yourself no
   way safe till you hang on that nail! You need not talk to others about
   trusting in Christ till you have first trusted yourselves!

   Out of the many hearers who have listened to me so long, may there not
   be a great number who though taught in the Doctrine of the Word have
   never yet been obedient to it? For a man to perish before knowing the
   Gospel will be a dreary thing. But for him to die when he knows the
   Gospel is something horrible--to be drowned with the life belt within
   reach! To perish in the dark, when the light is to be had! To die of
   famine, like Tantalus, with the golden apples close to one's lips! To
   perish of thirst with the water gurgling at one's throat! Oh, it will
   forever be a sound of horror in the lost ones' ears when they shall
   hear the echo of the Sabbath bells--if such sounds can penetrate the
   murky regions where lost spirits dwell--the sound, I say, of the
   Sabbath bells reminding them of Lord's-Days wasted and neglected! The
   sound familiar to them when on earth of the preacher's voice as he
   pleaded, entreated, thundered, threatened, wept, begged men to be
   saved! If there could be silence, there, and all could be forgotten,
   there might be a lull in the fierce hail-storm of Almighty Wrath! But
   they can never forget, for it is said, "Son, remember. Son,
   remember"--and they shall remember that they were called, but would not
   come, that they were invited, but declined the feast, that they were
   instructed, but shut their eyes--that they were wooed, but they
   hardened their necks and chose their own delusions! Oh, by the mercy of
   the blessed God, write not your names, my Hearers, among the guilty and
   terrible multitude!

   And may there not be some who come merely as casual hearers now and
   then, who, instead of gleaning anything that is good out of what we
   have tried to say, only remember our mistakes, our mannerisms, our
   faults of gesture or of style? It may be sport to some of you to sit
   and hear, but it is awful as death for us to stand and preach. I mean,
   it is no child's play for a man to feel, "I stand in God's place to
   that people this night, and as though God did beseech them by me, I am
   to pray them, as in Christ's stead, to be reconciled to God." He that
   can toy with his ministry and count it to be like a trade, or like any
   other profession, was never called of God! But he that has a charge
   pressing on his heart and a woe ringing in his ears, and preaches as
   though he heard the cries of Hell behind him, and saw his God looking
   down upon him--oh, how that man entreats the Lord that his hearers may
   not hear in vain! Yet, alas, alas, by how many who come to hear, all
   that is good is forgotten, and only some worthless thing is treasured
   up? As among those who go to the goldsmith's shop, while one is looking
   at a pearl, and another admires a ruby, and another would gladly
   purchase a diamond, there may be an idiot who picks up a coal from the
   floor and thinks that shall be his--takes it home with him and blackens
   his fingers with it, and then goes his way and finds fault with the
   jeweler who dropped it--so are you foolish people and unwise who are
   attracted by nothing that is precious in the Gospel, but are diligent
   to collect any refusethat drops in the pulpit! Oh, Sirs, if you must
   find fault with us, do so, and welcome, as much as ever you will, but
   do not forget that there is the Truth of God in the sentence that if
   you are to be saved, you must rest alone upon the work of Jesus! You
   need saving! You need it tonight! There may never be another occasion
   on which you may have an opportunity of finding salvation! The
   opportunity is given to you now. May the Holy Spirit give you the will
   as well as the occasion, and may you now say--

   "I'll go to Jesus though my sins, Have like a mountain rose! I know His
   courts, I'll enter in Whatever may oppose. Prostrate I'll lie before
   His Throne And there my sins confess. I'll tell Him I'm a wretch undone
   Without His Sovereign Grace." God bless these words for Jesus' sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 41:1-18.

   God enters into a controversy with those who had fallen into the
   worship of idols.

   Verse 1. Keep silence before Me, O islands, and let the people renew
   their strength. Let them come near, then let them speak: let us come
   near together to judgment. He challenges them to a debate. He gives
   them breathing time--bids them prepare themselves and come with the
   best arguments that their minds could find.

   2, 3. Who raised up the righteous man from the east? Who called him to
   his feet, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings?
   Who gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his
   bow? He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had
   not gone with his feet Who was it that raised up Cyrus and who made him
   strong to defeat the foe? Did the false gods do it? Could they claim
   any share therein? He puts it to them.

   4. Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the
   beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last, I am He. Long
   before Cyrus was born, God thus spoke of him! It is declared what work
   he should do. What better proof could there be that God is God? Do the
   false gods foretell the future? Are their oracles to be depended upon?
   Yet the Lord's Word is true and stands fast forever. "I Jehovah, the
   first, and with the last, I am He."

   5, 6. The isles saw it, and feared: the ends of the earth were afraid,
   drew near and came. They helped, everyone, his neighbor; and everyone
   said to his brother, Be of good courage. When men fight against God,
   they get united. What a very sad thing it is that God's children should
   ever fall out. There is one sin that I never heard charged upon the
   devils-- the sin of disunity. Of all the evil things we have heard, I
   have never heard that among the principalities of the Pit there has
   ever been any division into sects and parties. Oh, sad that in this
   respect we should fall short of them! The enemies of God helped
   everyone, his neighbor, "and everyone said to his brother, Be of good
   courage."

   7. So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with
   the hammer, him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the
   soldering. And he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
   What a sarcastic description of god-making this is! There is the
   carpenter and then the goldsmith to spread the plates of gold over the
   wood. And then it is soldered and it has to be fastened with nails. The
   simple facts about the making of gods are sufficient to pour ridicule
   upon idolatry! God deliver us from idolatry of any shape or form,
   whether it comes from Rome or Canterbury! May we have no symbol--no
   visible object of worship, whatever--but get rid of all that and before
   the great invisible Spirit let us bow, worshipping Him in spirit and in
   truth! For the least touch of the symbolic soon lends on to the
   idolatrous! And what at the first seemed harmless, soon comes to be so
   harmful that well does the Law say, "You shall not make unto you any
   graven image for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God." Oh, to keep
   clear of this great and heinous sin!

   8, 9. But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen. The
   seed of Abraham, My friend. You whom I have taken from the ends of the
   earth, and called you from the chief men thereof, and said unto you,
   You are My servant I have chosen you, and not cast you away. The people
   of Israel were reserved by God that they might worship Him. While other
   nations went to their idols, the Israelites were to be His servants,
   chaste in heart towards Him. It is so with the Lord's believing people.
   You are elected and selected, chosen and ordained, and set apart. You
   may fear the Lord and notgive your hearts to any other. May God grant
   that we may be true to this, our sacred trust. Notice how very sweetly
   in this text the Lord alludes to His friendship to Abraham, "The seed
   of Abraham, My friend'" When the Lord makes a friend of a man, He means
   it, and He keeps up that friendship to His children and His children's
   children! Happy are they who have a father who is a friend of God! Just
   as David did good to Mephibosheth for the sake of Jonathan, so,
   doubtless, many blessings come to the children for the sake of their
   parents. The Lord keeps mercy to the third and fourth generation, yes,
   and throughout all generations to them that keep His Covenant.

   10. Fear you not, for I am with you. What cause for fear now? If I am
   with You, you need not fear all the men on earth, nor all the demons of
   the Pit! Fear you not, for I am with you."

   10. Be not dismayed: for I am your God. " YourGod." Lay the stress
   there if you will, or, "your God, therefore your All-Sufficient
   Helper--your Immutable, Faithful, everlasting Friend."

   10-12. I will strengthen you: yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold
   you with the right hand of My righteousness. Behold all they that were
   incensed against you shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as
   nothing; and they that strive with you shall perish. You shall seek
   them and shall not find them, even them that contended with you. They
   that war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing. Go
   on, then, child of God! All your foes that resist your salvation shall
   disappear before your onward march. "Resist the devil, and he will flee
   from you." Advance to meet your cares and God shall take your cares
   away. Only be you strong and of a good courage, and rest in the
   everlasting arm, and you shall be more than a conqueror!

   13. 14. For I, the Lord, your God, will hold your right hand, saying
   unto you, Fear not: I will help you. Fear not, you worm, Jacob. Poor
   worm! How can it take care of itself? Even a bird can destroy it. "Fear
   not, you worm, Jacob." You know what a worm does for its defense. It is
   all that it can do--it hides itself in the earth. Hide yourself in your
   God! Get you into the rock and there be hidden till the danger is past.
   "Fear not, you worm, Jacob."

   14. And you men of Israel: I will help you, says the Lord and your
   Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel How many times the Lord puts it, "I
   will help you"! How again and again He says, "Fear not"! For
   despondency is deeply engraved in some spirits. There are some minds
   that seem to gravitate that way, again and again, and again--and even
   the Divine assurances have to be given repeatedly before they feel
   comfort! Have any of you been troubled because your children do not
   learn the first time you teach them? See how you are towards your
   heavenly Father! How many times He has to teach you, line upon line,
   precept upon precept--here a little and there a little--and if He has
   patience with our infirmities, we may very readily have patience with
   the infirmities of our little ones!

   15. Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having
   teeth. He will make poor feeble worms to be like that great corn-drag
   which they were accustomed to draw over the straw to bruise out the
   wheat.

   15, 16. You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shall
   make the hills as chaff You shall fan them and the wind shall carry
   them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice
   in the LORD, and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel. Truly, when
   mountains are beaten into chaff and blown away with the winnowing fan,
   there is room for rejoicing and magnifying God! If there were no
   difficulties, there would be no victories! If we had no trials, we
   should have no tests of Jehovah's strength! But out of our afflictions
   we get our joys. The deeper our sorrows, the higher our exultations
   when God helps us through them.

   17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their
   tongue fails for thirst, I, the LORD, will hear them. I, the God of
   Israel, will not forsake them. What a blessed promise that is! God
   thinks of poor and needy men. When they are in their greatest
   extremity, with nothing to quench their thirst, and they are ready to
   die, then He is pleased to make the rocks run with rivers in order that
   they may be supplied.

   18. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of
   the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry
   land springs of water.

The Multitude Before the Throne

   (No. 3403)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "After this Ibeheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could
   number, of allnations, tribes, people and tongues stood before the
   Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
   their hands, and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
   which sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb." Revelation 7:9,10.

   IT seems as though a dash of wonderment thrilled through his soul and a
   flame of admiration burst from his tongue, when John exclaims, "After
   this I beheld, and lor He had already seen much. His attention was
   fixed. His thoughts were strained. All of a sudden, then, a fresh scene
   breaks on his view and he betrays his surprise. At what, you say?
   Evidently he was astonished that the vision was not yet complete. Ah,
   Brothers and Sisters! In order to understand the deep things of God, we
   need to be patient in our contemplation. Had John turned away his eyes,
   relaxed his study, or withdrawn his gaze from the marvelous panorama,
   he would not have seen the better part of his vision! As a Jew, when he
   had seen the twelve tribes pass before him, he might have been tempted
   to say, "It is enough! There is a remnant according to the election of
   Grace in Israel! Lord, Your servant is content! I would now open my
   eyes again to earth and forget these mysteries." This is what many have
   done practically when they have been looking at a Gospel Truth. They
   have not been desirous to see it all, though glad enough to see some
   part of the Truth of God which seemed to suit their prejudice--they
   have taken their eyes away from the excellent glory before they have
   seen the whole of the Truth, as though they were afraid of discovering
   too much, as though they were always glad not to learn anything beyond,
   for fear it would not square with what they had learned before! John,
   however, being patient and taught of God, continued to look--and when
   the august assembly of the 144,000 had passed before him, he saw a far
   greater multitude of the Gentile race and he heard from them a louder
   song than he had heard from the chosen multitude before, as they said,
   "Salvation to our God who sits upon the Throne and unto the Lamb." Be
   steadfast, then, you searchers into the Truths of God. Look long! Look
   earnest! Ask the Lord to let you see as much as you may. Then that
   petition being granted, comfort yourselves with this reflection, "What
   you know not now you shall know hereafter." Some things He will not
   tell you because you cannot bear them now, but let there be nothing hid
   from you because your interest flags and you do not wish to see it! Be
   willing to learn and let your eyes be open to see the whole of the
   Truth which Jesus would reveal. Turning, then, to the vision described
   in our text, the first thing in it that we ought to meditate upon is--

   I. THE GREAT CENTER OF THE HEAVENLY WORLD.

   It seems that all the saints and angels that John saw surrounded one
   common rallying place--the Throne of God and of the Lamb. They were not
   broken up into groups, some of them considering this subject, and
   others investigating that. They were not divided into parties, some
   calling themselves by one name, and some by another. All in one group
   they stood, though their number was beyond all human count, and every
   eye was directed to one common object--yes, and every heart went with
   every eye--and every tongue sounded the same song, and that a song of
   adoration to the same One who was the center of all!

   Does not this teach us that God is the very center of Heaven We might
   have guessed this, for He is center of all the new creation. Even now
   all those that are born-again live in Him, inheriting all the blessings
   of eternal life in their union to Christ, and their fellowship with
   Him. From Him they derive all their light--to Him and upon Him they
   reflect all the light, again, giving all the glory unto Him from whom
   they received all the Grace. He who built Heaven, He who supports
   Heaven, He who chose every inhabitant in Heaven, He who fashioned every
   inhabitant for Heaven, He who bought every inhabitant of Heaven with
   His precious blood, He who is the Father of all and the Friend of all,
   may well be the center of all joy, of all observation, and of all
   worship in the eternal world!

   Note, however, particularly, that the center of the heavenly worship is
   not God in the act of Creation, but God upon the Throne. Divine
   Sovereignty is the very center of Heaven! John saw God on the Throne.
   Here, below, if we speak upon

   Divine Sovereignty too plainly, we have to encounter the objections of
   many who pronounce it a hard saying and ask "Who can bear it?" That the
   Potter shall have power over the clay to do as He wills with each lump,
   that He should have mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and do as He
   wills with His own, grates harshly on their ears! I know it is because
   hearts are hard upon earth, for in that place where every heart is
   right with God, they are all too glad to let Him sway the scepter. This
   is the very crown of their song--"The Lord God Omnipotent reigns." His
   will is their supreme delight. They understand that His will, despotic
   as it may seem, and unquestioned by any creature, is a will of mercy,
   of tenderness, of wisdom, of holiness, and of truth! Therefore, they
   pay their adorations to Him as King of kings and Lord of lords. This is
   a peculiar subject of their joy--that God has a Throne, that He sits
   upon it and that He rules over all things, and all things do His
   bidding. The central thought of Heaven, then, is Divine Sovereignty.

   You will remark that we are told there was also the Lamb upon the
   Throne--as if to teach us that even in Heaven, the glory of the
   reigning God, working all things according to the counsels of His will,
   were a sight all too bright even for those pure spirits, unless they
   saw side by side with Him the Substitute, the Lamb of God! They see
   Jesus still under the form of a Sin-Bearer, Jesus represented by the
   symbolic emblem of a Lamb, a Lamb that had been slain, Jesus the
   Sufferer, Jesus the Crucified, Jesus who once died for sin and has
   forever put it away by His blood. Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, how I
   love these two doctrines as I see them side by side--God, a Sovereign,
   makes me tremble--Christ, the Lamb, makes me rejoice with trembling!
   God, a Sovereign, overawes me! I take off my shoes, like Moses at the
   burning bush, but the Lamb has a voice that bids me draw near and have
   fellowship even with the God who is a consuming fire!

   Oh, how much this ought to be the object of our thoughts on earth,
   seeing that it is the main object of their thoughts in Heaven! We have
   often heard statements made by persons of what they mean to do in
   Heaven. I read in a biography the other day of one who had not told
   another person certain feelings of his, as he meant to tell them in the
   other world. Believe me, we shall have something better to do than
   discourse of trifles in that upper sphere! We may even dismiss that
   stanza of Dr. Watts--

   "And with transporting joy, recount The labors of our feet"

   It is but a poetic fiction! What are "the labors of our feet" that they
   should engross our attention? The reigning God will absorb our
   thoughts! How we can serve Him, the Supreme, will occupy our minds! The
   Lamb who once upon the Cross was slain, but now upon His Throne does
   reign--how we can make the universe resound with His praises, how we
   can fly at His bidding, if He wills, from world to world, and proclaim
   the matchless story of His love! How we may be able to make known to
   angels, principalities and powers in the heavenly places the manifold
   wisdom of God--this, it seems to me, will engross our attention far
   more than any of the trifling circumstances of time, or any of the
   occurrences that were connected with our pilgrimage here below! Oh,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, let us, while we are sojourning on earth,
   keep God upon the Throne uppermost in our hearts and so school
   ourselves in heavenly contemplation. Let us keep Christ uppermost with
   us in our meditations, in our conversations and in our actions. Let us
   be God's men! Let us be Christ's men! God upon the Throne, Christ the
   Lamb upon the Throne--let this be our central attraction. Let us count
   it to be our pleasure to live here, as it will be our superlative
   pleasure to live forever hereafter, as worshippers who do homage before
   the Throne of God and the Lamb! We have seen the Divine Center, now,
   let us carefully mark-- II. THE DIVINE CIRCLE--the living throng that
   surrounded the Throne of God.

   They are mentioned as "a multitude that no man can number." This leads
   me to remark--although I cannot find words to fitly express the
   thought--that I will call it the sociality of God. He was God over all,
   blessed forever, self-existent, independent, needing no creature to
   assist Him, or to add to His Glory or His happiness. But He chose to
   create worlds--how many we can never guess. The revelations of
   astronomy seem to tell us that He made them as lavishly as men might
   cast seed when they sow it broadcast over many acres. There they
   glitter in the expanse of space, and for all we know, every one of them
   filled with happy beings! We cannot tell. But God would not be alone.
   He willed not to be alone. He delighted in the habitable parts of the
   worlds that He chose to make. If you confine your view but to this
   world, you may discern that He would not be alone. He made this planet.
   He fitted it up to be the abode of living creatures. The Divine Being
   has been pleased to create all sorts and forms of beauty and of
   life--from the tiny animalcule that finds an ocean in a drop of water,
   up to the leviathan that makes the very deep to boil like a pot and
   causes the waves thereof to be hoary with his mighty lashings. God was
   pleased to make the eagle to fly aloft in the heavens and the fish to
   cut the deep. All these creatures He has fed for many generations. Upon
   all these He looks with interest and compassion. He hears the young
   ravens when they cry. What a boundless Creation! If every separate
   world that He has made has such an amazing catalog of life, what
   multitudes of creatures now cluster round about the great Eternal One!
   He dwelt alone,but He chose not to be alone. And now He has built His
   house and filled His mighty chambers with many mansions into which He
   has been pleased to put a thousand forms of life. And then He said
   within Himself, "I will make a creature different from all the rest I
   have made as yet--it shall be a spirit that can converse with
   me--intelligent, immortal." And He created those first-born sons of
   light. I know not how many they may be, but our Covenant God, Father,
   Son, and Spirit formed servants suitable for the higher will and
   loftier behests in the cherubim and seraphim whom He made to be like
   flames of fire and who cheerfully flash to do His bidding. And then,
   last of all, He said--and here, the Divine Unity comes into counsel
   with itself--"Let Us make man after Our own image," and He made a
   strange creature, matchless and altogether unique--part of which was
   taken from the ground and kindred with the soil, which might die if it
   sinned, but another part of which was immaterial, fitted to tenant any
   of the spheres in the great universe and should exist forever-- a
   spirit made in the image of God! So He made us and at this day, despite
   sin which seemed to rob God of all His newborn servants and sons, whom
   He had created in the loins of Adam, He has a multitude that no man can
   number, who are nearer to Him than even angels are, associates and
   friends with Christ, His Son, brought into union with Christ, married
   to Him. Is it not a marvelous subject if one could dive into it, this
   social Character of the Divine Being, that He willed not to be alone,
   that He still continues to constantly surround Himself with ten
   thousand times ten thousand spirits whom He ordains to bless? Oh, that
   I might be among them! Does not each one of you say so? Oh, that I
   might tread the courts of His house! To be but a hired servant within
   His gates might well content me, but oh, if I might be His son and as
   His child, might draw near to Him!--how would I bless that glorious
   Being from whom I sprang and into whose bosom I would leap back
   again--the source of my life, the sum total of my bliss, my God, my
   All! Think that thought over another time. I leave it with you.

   Another thought rises out of the text. If there shall be in Heaven a
   multitude surpassing all human arithmetic, out of all nations, and
   tribes, and peoples, and tongues, how certain the Gospel is to achieve
   yet a great success. We are always fretting. We are in a great hurry
   for results. We are impatient of the issue, for we cannot see how the
   Kingdom of God will come and gladly would we want to hasten the wheels
   of our Lord's chariot. Well, but our fears may be put aside and our
   disquietude may be allayed when we remember that as surely as Jehovah
   lives, Christ must see of the travail of His soul--and He shall see of
   it in the ultimate salvation of a number out of all nations that are
   beyond all human count! Patience, my Brothers and Sisters, patience,
   but diligence! Let us work at the same time that we wait. Let us serve,
   for the cause is in good hands. The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
   in the hands of Christ! He shall not have died in vain! He shall not
   lose the purchase of His blood! A countless multitude must be saved! As
   surely as He bought them, so surely will He wash them in the blood
   which He shed on their behalf! Perhaps the day of the Church's great
   growth will come when she returns to something like her primitive mode
   of warfare. Those who first went out to convert the world were but a
   handful of men--one room contained them all--yet within a few years
   there was not a nation upon earth that had not heard the Gospel! Even
   to the remotest isles the Truth of Jesus had been carried, and who were
   the men who carried it? Brothers, they were men who never framed a
   syllogism--men who never embellished a sermon with rhetorical art! For
   the most part, they were men who spoke only the language of the common
   people--spoke it, I doubt not, earnestly, but certainly not according
   to the lordly rhetoric of the schools. They were not men who strove to
   be intellectual. They were not deep thinkers. They were not profoundly
   learned. They were men who knew but this one thing--that a Savior had
   come into the world and that they were intent to tell men about Him!
   They spoke of this and of this only in burning words with tender
   feelings and fervent appeals to the conscience. But now-a-days, indeed,
   we are told that the world is to be converted by logic! That it is to
   be reasonedout of its sins! That it is to be enlightened by the tapers
   of human intellect until the darkness of Hell shall be scattered!
   Believe me, we are on the wrong tack if we think this! It is not so!
   "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of Hosts,"
   and the Spirit works with the simple Gospel, and only with the simple
   Gospel! When we get back to this conviction and return to this
   practice, we shall begin to see the countless multitudes flocking first
   to the Church on earth and afterwards to the Church above. I will ask
   you, my Brothers and Sisters here who have been converted, how were you
   saved? How were you converted? Was it by learning? Was it by the flash
   of some glorious speech of some mighty master of rhetoric? I confess
   that if I were converted to God--and I trust I was--it was through the
   ministration of a very simple, humble, uneducated man. I believe the
   confession of the most of God's children will be such as gives the
   glory to the Gospel, and not to the preacher's skill, art or intellect.
   If you have received comfort, and if you have received light, these
   things have come to you by the means of one who could not claim the
   glory, for he was but an earthen vessel--the excellence of the power
   was conspicuously of God and not of him! Oh, Spirit of God, bring back
   Your Church to a belief in the Gospel! Bring back her ministers to
   preach it once again withthe Holy Spirit, and not striving after wit
   and learning. Then shall we see Your arm made bare, O God, in the eyes
   of all the people, and the myriads shall be brought to rally round the
   Throne of God and the Lamb! The Gospel must succeed! It shall succeed!
   It cannot be prevented from succeeding--a multitude that no man can
   number must be saved!

   Kindly allow me to continue on the same point the Divine circle in
   Heaven. Notice the variety. "Out of every nation and tribe, and people,
   and tongue." How did John know that? I suppose as he looked at them, he
   could tell where they come from. There is individuality in Heaven,
   depend upon it! Every seed will have its own body. There will sit down
   in Heaven not three unknown patriarchs, but Abraham--you will know him!
   Isaac--you will know him! And Jacob--you will know him! There will be
   in Heaven not a company of persons, all struck off alike so that you
   cannot tell who is who, but they will be out of every nation, and
   tribe, and people, and tongue. I say not that they will speak the
   language they spoke on earth, but I do say that there will be certain
   idiosyncrasies and peculiar marks about them that will permit the
   onlooker to know, as John knew, that they are not all of one nation,
   but of all nations, tribes, people and tongues. I like this. The very
   charm of nature is its variety. If all flowers were alike, where were
   the glorious crown of summer? And if all bodies in the Resurrection
   world, or even all spirits in the disembodied state could all be
   precisely one like another, the very beauty of Heaven would be extinct
   in a degree. No, there they are from different tribes, nations, peoples
   and tongues--and this betokens individuality and gives us hope that we
   shall know each other in Heaven even as we are known!

   Yet a unity about them, for they all wore white robes, and they all
   carried palms, and they all sang the same song. There are twelve gates
   to the New Jerusalem, but they all lead to the same city, and there is
   the same center. There were twelve foundations, but they were all laid
   on the one Foundation. So they may be many views and notions of truth
   that we may hold, but they must all be bottomed on Christ Jesus and
   founded there. And if they are, we shall all meet in the better land.
   There is a variety in Heaven, yet there is a unity of experience, and a
   unity in the gratitude they feel. May you and I be there to help to
   increase the variety and to certify the unity of the heavenly throng!
   And now for a few words of running comment on the description given
   of--

   III. THE SACRED COMPANY, THEMSELVES, which will supply us with a third
   point. They "stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with
   white robes, and palms in their hands." That they stood is not meant to
   teach us that they do not sit or rest in Heaven, for they always rest
   in Heaven. But they stand--that is to say--they are confirmed, they are
   established, they are secure. Their feet shall never slide. They stand
   in no slippery places. They stand before the Throne of God! It is the
   posture of action--they stand like soldiers ready for the march--like
   servants who but need to have it said to them, "Go," and they go. Oh,
   that we could on earth realize this posture of Heaven! The Lord hold us
   up that we may stand--may our feet never slide--and oh, that we might
   stand with loins girt ready for whatever He shall bid us do! Alas, we
   need often to shake ourselves, for we lie upon the bed of sloth and we
   are given to slumber. If we would be like those are who see His face,
   we should always stand and watch, that whatever the Master says to us,
   we would be ready to obey.

   That they stood "before the Throne" shows that they are in the
   immediate Presence of God. They are not excluded from His Presence,
   they are not at a distance, but they behold His Glory to peculiar
   advantage and He is near to them in a remarkably gracious and glorious
   manner. They stand before the Throne of God. Yes, and this is the charm
   of Heaven, to dwell in the Presence of God! You have tasted, then,
   something of what Heaven means, my dear Brothers and Sisters. Sometimes
   you have been near to Christ and in full fellowship with Him you have
   sipped of the golden cup from which you shall drink forever! You have
   tasted of immortal fruit that shall furnish your everlasting food. This
   is Heaven-- forever to behold His face, forever to stand like a
   courtier in the very court, itself, like a favorite before the
   Throne--not in the outer courts--not in the court of the Gentiles, but
   inside the veil, before the Throne, within the glorious mystery, the
   sanctum sanctorum, in the Holy of Holies, right where God, Himself, is!
   There shall we stand forever and forever!

   That they were "clothed with white robes'" is not a little significant.
   Nakedness was revealed to man by sin. Before the time when he sinned,
   he was naked and not ashamed. But then he strove to make himself a
   dress and the fig leaf was the result. But Christ has come in and
   clothed us--clothed us completely. The robes spoken of here seem to
   have covered them from head to foot. They were "clothed with white
   robes"--not partly clad, but altogether clad in them. Oh, how comely
   that righteousness of Christ which He has worked for us, and worked in
   us wherewith we shall be clothed when we stand before the eternal
   Throne of God! Brothers and Sisters, rejoice to put it on tonight!
   Rejoice to feel that His blood and righteousness, even now--

   "Your beauty are your glorious dress."

   Anticipate the time when you shall be admired of men and of angels,
   attired in that complete garment. These robes are said to be "white
   robes"--white to indicate purity--and "they are without fault before
   the Throne of God." White--as distinctive of their priestly order, "for
   they are kings and priests unto God forever and ever." White--as an
   emblem of triumph, for now they are victors over every foe.

   But why and how came those robes to be white? Their robes are white
   because His robes were red--His robes I say. Oh, how the angels gazed
   with astonishment, and asked with eagerness, as they saw Him come back
   from Calvary, "Why are Your garments red? Why are You red in Your
   apparel as one that has trodden the winepress?" And He answered, "I
   have trodden the winepress alone, and of the people there was none with
   Me." Because the Savior bled and dyed His garments with His own blood
   for us, therefore, filthy as the saints' garments once were, they are
   now robed in pure immaculate white, whiter than any fuller could make
   them, glistening like the sun!

   Oh, the joy of being there! May it soon come to us! It will! It may
   come now, while yet we are talking here--

   "Soon may the hand be stretched And dumb the mouth that lisps this
   faltering strain."

   But if it were so, then sudden death would be sudden glory! Are you
   sure, each one of you, that it would be so? Would your departure out of
   this life be your entrance into the eternal life? Would the shutting of
   these poor eyes be the opening of nobler optics upon a brighter scene?
   Believer, it would be so with you! Then why are you afraid to die? No,
   rather, be willing at any time to gather up your feet into the bed and
   die--your father's God to meet--where the white-robed company see His
   face!

   To complete the description, we will only remark that the palms in
   their hands may refer to their observing that great feast of the Lord,
   the feast of tabernacles, when the harvest of the earth is complete,
   when the sabbathism that remains to the people of God is attained and
   the pleasures which are at God's right hand forevermore are
   realized--for so of old it was ordained, as we read in Leviticus--that
   at this festival the Israelites should take palm branches in their
   hands and rejoice before the Lord their God. This seems to have been
   the acme of felicity in their sacred year.

   I wish I had the power to describe this glorious circle--those bright
   ones before the Throne, that you could see them! I think, as I look
   upon them, that I can see even now the Apostolic band. I mark the
   goodly fellowship of the Prophets. I think I see the martyrs with their
   ruby crowns. Do not I see the ministers and confessors of Christ, some
   of my own kith and kin that have gone before me--the Covenanters who
   bled in Scotland, and the heroes of Smithfield? There they stand, and
   listen!--how they sing! None shall excel them in their song of praise.
   You have a mother there, perhaps--a sister, or a brother, or your
   grandfather who, years ago "went over to the majority" to sing among
   that countless multitude. Oh, if I could but have a vision of all that
   will be there within the next hundred years, would I see myself, and
   would I see all this company there? Oh, if it were possible, I would
   gladly translate you all to Heaven at once--from the Tabernacle to the
   Temple, from this place where we sing His praises at His footstool to
   the place where we will sing them to His face more sweetly and more
   loudly by far! Not one of you, oh, not one of you would we have absent!
   Though, Friend, you may be out of sight, and almost out of hearing, one
   who has just managed to crowd in among the multitude that throng this
   house--oh, may you with all the rest of us have a place among His
   chosen--and may none of you find your name left out when He, for them,
   shall call! Are you believing in Jesus? If so, you should be there! Are
   you an unbeliever? If you die as you are, you must be driven from His
   Presence--you must be destroyed from the glory of His power--all the
   joy and bliss that make up life must be crushed out of you and you must
   live banished from Him forever! And now to close. It seems that--

   IV. THIS GOODLY COMPANY WHO SURROUNDED THE CENTRAL THRONE OF GOD WERE
   ENGAGED

   IN SONG.

   They "cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our GOD which sits
   upon the Throne and unto the Lamb." I was reading the other day a book
   containing the life of a very excellent Primitive Methodist minister,
   and I was greatly amused to find in his diary an allusion to myself. He
   says, "Went to Stroud to hear Mr. Spurgeon. He is a rank Calvinist, but
   a good man." I was pleased to find that I was a good man, and I was
   equally pleased to find that I was a rank Calvin-ist! And when I came
   to review the book I was obliged to say that our Brother was quite
   correct about my being a rank Calvinist, and we believed that he was
   one, too, now that he has gone to Heaven! They are all Calvinists
   there! Every soul of them! They may have been Armenians on
   earth--thousands and millions of them were--but they are not after they
   get there, for here is their song, "Salvation unto our God which sits
   upon the Throne." That is all my Calvinism. I am sure that is what
   Calvin preached, what Augustine preached, what Paul preached, what
   Christ would have us preach!

   And this is what they sing in Heaven--"Salvation unto our God which
   sits upon the Throne and unto the Lamb." They sing in Heaven that it
   was God that planned salvation, 'twas God that ordained them to
   salvation, 'twas God that gave them salvation, 'twas the Lamb that
   brought them salvation, 'twas all of God that that salvation was
   carried on, and all of God that their salvation was ever perfected!
   They do not, one of them, say, "Stop, now! Salvation unto our God, yes,
   but still, free will had a hand in it." Oh, no, no, no! There never was
   a soul in Heaven that ever thought that! They all feel, when they get
   there, that although God never violated their free wills, yet He made
   them willing in the day of His power, and that it was His Free Grace
   that brought them to come and love the Savior! I am sure, if the verse
   were given out in Heaven, that we sometimes sing at Communion, they
   would sing it there--

   "'Twas all of Your Grace we were made to obey,

   While others were suffered to go

   The road which by nature we chose as our way,

   And which leads to the chambers of woe." And I think they would sing
   that other verse that we sing at the Lord's Table--

   "Why was I made to hear Your voice,

   And enter while there's room,

   While thousands make a wretched choice,

   And rather starve than come?

   'Twas the same love that spread the feast,

   That kindly forced me in,

   Else I had still refused to taste,

   And perished in my sin."

   This is how they sing in Heaven, then. It is salvation--salvation all
   of Grace! Salvation of which the glory, from first to last, must all be
   given to God, and to God alone. They exclude themselves! They give no
   boasting to themselves. They do not say, "Salvation unto our better
   nature; salvation to our choicer Grace." No, no! But all unto the Lord,
   all unto the Lord from first to last! Well, Brothers and Sisters, some
   of us will not have to change our note much when we get there, for that
   has been the burden of our song here! It has been the theme of our
   ministry from our youth up, "Salvation is of the Lord." We have learned
   it somewhere in the same college as that in which Jonah learned that
   old Calvinistic theology. He had to go into the whale's belly to learn
   it, and when he came out, he said, "Salvation is of the Lord." And we,
   too, in sharp afflictions, pains, and griefs have had to learn it and
   have it burned into us! And we never believed it more thoroughly in our
   lives than we do now, that if a sinner is saved, it is God's work that
   saves him--and God must have all the glory of it.

   I pray the Lord to convince any poor needy soul that there is salvation
   in Him--and enable that poor soul now to come and take it--take it by a
   simple act of faith. You have not got to save yourselves. Christ has
   saved you. You have but to trust Him and you are saved. There is
   nothing for you to do--nothing for you to be, but simply to be
   nothing-- and to let Christ be All-in-All to you, to look and live,
   for--

   "There's life in a look at the Crucified One."

   God grant that you may look, and so be among the countless throng who
   shall sing His praises forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 7.

   Verse 1. Andafter these things I saw four angels standing on the four
   corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the
   wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. A
   perfect calm there must be till God's people are saved. Not a leaf
   shall stir to do them damage. Not a dash of foam upon the waters--no
   movement of wind, or sea, or tree.

   2, 3. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
   of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to
   whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea. Saying, Hurt not the
   earth neither the sea, nor the trees till we have sealed the servants
   of our God on their foreheads. Everything exists for the servants of
   God! Creation is but a scaffold for the Church--and when God's Church
   is finished, then all may be taken down--but not till then.

   4, 5. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
   sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
   children of Israel. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand.
   Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. The order is not
   that of nature, but of Grace, otherwise Reuben would have come first.
   And the election of God is not according to birth or blood, but
   according to His Sovereign will. Judah, then Reuben.

   5-8. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
   Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed
   twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.
   Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
   Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Zabulon were
   sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve
   thousand And of the last and least tribe, still the same.

   8. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. I think many
   Believers belong to the tribe of Benjamin-- doubting fearing, little in
   faith and confidence--but Benjamin still has his men.

   9. After this I beheld The Gentile Church.

   9. And, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all
   nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues. It will do some people
   good to see that sight, for they fancy that all the saints go to their
   place of worship! There are no good people anywhere except those that
   think exactly as they do. So they seem to fancy. Oh, that their eyes
   were opened a little, for I am afraid that some Christians are very
   much like the mouse that had always lived in a box and on some grand
   occasion climbed up to the edge of the box. He looked over and saw the
   vast area of the cupboard, and said, "I had no idea the world was as
   big as that!" And yet it had never been outside the cupboard even then.
   Oh, for eyes that could see a sight like this! "After this, I beheld,
   and lo, a great multitude which no man could number" (we can count
   pretty high, too) "of all nations, and tribes, and people, and
   tongues."

   9. Stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
   robes.Perfectly pure--perfectly happy-- arrayed like priests and
   conquerors, for they had "palms in their hands."

   9-11. And palms in their hands. And cried with a loud voice saying,
   Salvation to our God who sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And
   all the angels stood round about the Thron. In the outer ring and about
   the elders that represent the Church, who stand in the inner ring,
   nearest to Christ and nearest akin to the Son of Man.

   11, 12. And about the elders and four beasts, and fell before the
   Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing and
   glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might be
   unto our God forever and ever Amen. Grand ascriptions of praise to make
   the worship perfect, as all worship should be which is presented to
   God--as all worship will be when we shall once get to Heaven.

   13. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are fhese.?This
   vast crowd--who are these? 13-17. Who are arrayed in white robes? And
   where did they come from? And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And he
   said to me, These are they who came out of the great tribulation, and
   have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
   Therefore are they before the Throne ofGod, andserve Him day andnight
   in His Temple: andHe who sits on the Throne shall dwell among them.
   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the
   sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb who is in the midst of
   the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains
   of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

A Gross Indignity

   (No. 3404)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they spit upon Him." Matthew 27:30.

   The night before He had "sweat, as it were, great drops of blood
   falling to the ground," that fair visage, which was "fairer than that
   of any of the sons of men," had been marred by agony and grief without
   parallel. During that night He had no rest--He was dragged away from
   one tribunal to another. First, He was brought before a council of
   priests. Soon after He stood before Pilate and now, after the mockery
   of a trial, He is given up to the soldiers, that they may mock Him
   before His execution. 'Tis He--the world's Redeemer, the long expected
   Messiah--He is led out as a condemned criminal--condemned as a traitor
   and given up for blasphemy, that He may die the death! Do you see Him?
   They bring forth an old stool--they call that a throne--the Monarch who
   sways the scepter of the universe, is placed thereon! They thrust into
   His hand a reed to mock that golden scepter, the touch of which has so
   often given mercy to rebels! And now they play the worshipper before
   Him. But what is their worship? It consists of ribaldry and jeer.
   Having made sport of His kingship, they turn to ridicule His Character
   as a Prophet. They blindfold Him and strike Him in the face, some on
   one cheek, and some on the other, buffeting Him with the palms of their
   hands! They pluck His facial hair and then they say, making fools of
   themselves rather than of Him whom they thought to make a fool of,
   "Prophesy, who is he that struck You?" "Who is this that just now
   plucked Your beard?" "Who is it that struck You on the cheek?" Not
   content with this, they loosen the blindfold and He sees. What a sight
   is before Him! Faces in every conceivable shape mocking Him-- thrusting
   out the tongue or screwing it into the cheek, calling Him all the names
   that their low-lived dictionary could summon up, not content with
   heaping common scorn upon Him, but counting Him to be the very
   offscouring of all things. Names with which they would not degrade a
   dog, they use to defile Him! Then, to consummate all, they spit into
   His face. Those eyes, which make Heaven glad, and cause the angels to
   rejoice, are covered with the spit of these rascal soldiers. Down His
   cheek it trickles. That awful brow, the nod or shake of which reveals
   the everlasting decrees of God, is stained with spit from the mouths of
   wretches whom His own hands had made, whom He could have dashed into
   eternal destruction had He willed!

   When I muse on this, my soul is filled with sorrow. The very idea that
   Jesus Christ could ever have been spit upon by one in human shape
   appalls me! Do you remember what sort of face it was that these
   soldiers spit into? Shall I read you a description of it? One that
   loved Him and knew Him well, speaks of Him thus--"My Beloved is white.
   . . His Countenance is lovely." (Solomon's Song, 5:10, etc.). It was
   into this dear face, a coarse brutal soldiery must void their vile
   spit! O Church of Christ, was ever grief like yours, that your Husband
   should thus be defiled and that, too, for your sake? Was ever love like
   His that He should suffer these indignities for you? The angels crowd
   around His Throne to catch a glimpse of that fair Countenance. When He
   was born, they came to Bethlehem's manger that they might gaze upon
   that face while He was yet an Infant! And all through His devious path
   of sorrow, He was "seen of angels." They never turned away their eyes
   from Him, for never had they seen a visage so enchanting! What must
   they have thought when gathering round their Lord? Surely they would
   have gladly stretched their wings to have shielded that dear face! What
   anger must have filled their holy souls, what grief, if grief can be
   known by beings like themselves, when they saw these wretches, these
   inhuman creatures, spitting on Perfection! Oh, how they must have
   grieved when they saw the nasty spit about that mouth which is "most
   sweet," trickling down from those eyes which are "like the eyes of
   doves by rivers of waters," staining the cheeks which are "as a bed of
   spices, as sweet flowers," and falling on those lips which are "like
   lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh." This is a subject upon which I
   must meditate, even though I cannot preach. I cannot describe it to you
   unless your soul can now draw near to your buffeted Master, unless the
   Holy Spirit shall give you a near and dear--an intimate, quiet,
   soul-satisfying view and vision of Him. I cannot give it to you. As
   well might I attempt to hold a candle to show you the sun as to hope,
   by anything that I can say, to touch your passions or move your hearts
   towards my dear Lord and Master, if the vision of Him does not move you
   to grieve for sin, and to love Him because He suffered thus for you.
   All I propose tonight is to offer just a few thoughts on this startling
   fact in the history of our Redemption.

   "They spit upon Him." Let us learn here the deep depravity of the human
   race. When I see Adam in the midst of comfort putting forth his hand to
   take that one fruit which his Master had reserved for Himself, I see,
   indeed, sin and arrogance, daring assumption and a heinous crime! But I
   do not see so much of levity and lawlessness, there, as I do in this,
   that creatures should spit on the Creator! As I look through the annals
   of human guilt, I see strange stories of man in reckless, defiant
   rebellion against his Divine Sovereign. From that first evil hour until
   now, what strange monsters of guilt has the earth seen! We have heard
   of rapine and murder, crimes for which new names have been coined to
   meet the new atrocities which have been committed! Homicide,
   fratricide, patricide and matricide in which every sanctity of kin has
   been outraged. We have read of fornication and of adultery, and of
   lusts worse than bestial. Good God, what is not man capable of? Take
   but the bit from his mouth and the bridle from his jaws and to what
   depth of iniquity will he not descend? There is not a filthy dream that
   Satan ever had in the dark watches of his midnight reverie which man
   will not embody in act, and carry out in all its grim and dread
   reality! Strange are those tales that have come from a far-off land,
   where the heathen worship in their darkness. They not merely bow down
   to blocks of wood and stone, but degrade themselves with vices into
   which we could never have imagined humanity could plunge! O God, my
   heart is heavy as a stone, and smitten with very grief when I think of
   what an evil thing man is! Why did You not sweep him from the world?
   How can You permit a viper so obnoxious to nestle in the bosom of Your
   Providence? Oh, why do You permit such a den of thieves to wander
   abroad such a cage of unclean birds to swing in ether, and to be
   carried by Your power round the sun? Why do You not blast it, smite its
   mountains with desolation and fill its valleys with ashes of fire? Why
   do You not sweep the race of humans clean away and let their very name
   become a hissing and a scorn? But, my Brothers and Sisters, bad as man
   is, I think he never was so bad--or rather, his badness never came out
   to the full so much--as when gathering all his spite, his pride, his
   lust, his desperate defiance, his abominable wickedness into one
   mouthful--he spat into the face of the Son of God, Himself! Oh, this is
   an act that transcends every other! There are other deeds connected
   with the Crucifixion quite as malignant, but could there be any so
   vile? Surely we may say of the men that drove the nails into the
   Savior's hands that they did but that which they were ordered to do.
   They were soldiers, and because they were commanded by their military
   superiors, therefore, they did it. But this was a gratuitous act--this
   was done without command, without any pressure! It was the base
   wickedness of their own hearts. Sin saw Perfection in its power, and it
   must spit on Perfection's cheeks! The creature, the erring creature,
   saw its Creator in the mightiness of His condescension, putting Himself
   into His creature's power--and the creature spit upon Him to show how
   much He hated, how much He loathed, despised, abhorred, detested the
   very thought of Godhead--even when it was Godhead veiled in human flesh
   and come into the world to redeem!

   And now, while you blush with me for human nature, thus foaming out its
   own reeking depravity, do pray remember that such is your nature, and
   such is mine. Let us not talk of things in the general, but bring them
   home in particular. Just such a base wretch am I, and such a base
   wretch are you, my dear Hearer, by nature, as were those who thus
   insulted our Lord. I need not go far for proofs, for if we have not
   spit into the Savior's face, literally--that dear sorrow-scarred
   visage--we have, as opportunity offered, been as rude and wanton as
   they! Do you not remember the poor saint of God who talked to us of the
   things of the Kingdom--and we laughed him out of countenance? Do we not
   remember that servant of ours who anxiously longed to serve her God,
   but we threw every obstacle in her way, and never missed an opportunity
   of venting some jest or sneer upon her? And O, most precious Book of
   God, you legacy of my Redeemer, how often in the days of my
   unregeneracy have I spit on you and thrust you into a corner, that the
   novel of the day might have my attention? I have bidden you lie still,
   that I might read the newspaper, or something more trivial, and it may
   be, less innocent, might occupy my mind. O, you ministers of Christ!
   How have our hearts despised you! And you, you lovely ones, the lowly
   in heart who follow Christ in the midst of an evil generation, how
   often have we said hard things of you, mocked your piety, despised your
   humility, laughed at your prayers, and made jokes at those very
   expressions whichshowed the sincerity of your hearts! In all this what
   have we done? Have we not really spit into the face of Christ? Come,
   let us weep together! Let us sorrow as those who mourn over a
   first-born son, whose corpse lies unburied before them. I have spit
   into my Savior's face, but mercy of mercies, He who stands before you
   tonight, self-convicted, can also add, "But He has not spit in mine.
   No, He has kissed me with the kisses of His love," and He has said, "Go
   your way; your sins, which are many, are all forgiven. I have blotted
   out your iniquities like a cloud, and like a thick cloud your
   transgressions." Melt, then, you eyes, and stream down these cheeks,
   you briny tears, when I remember that He, whom I once despised, has not
   despised me! That He whom I abhorred, has not abhorred me! And though
   we hid, as it were, our faces from Him, He has not hidden His face from
   us--but here we are, forgiven sinners--though once we assailed Him with
   indignity as gross as those who spat into His face!

   Having propounded that melancholy fact, I pass on. May God the Holy
   Spirit impress each of these Truths upon our minds while I merely
   glance at them.

   Why was our Master's face full of spit? Sweet thought! Our faces were
   full of spots, and if the Master would save us, His face must be full
   of spots, too! He had none of His own--therefore those spots shall be
   given Him from the lips of scoffers. You know it became Him who saved
   us, that in everything He should be made like unto us. We were wounded.
   What then? "He was wounded for our transgressions." We were sick, and
   He, Himself, "bore our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows." Since we
   were worms, He must say, "I am a worm, and no man." And we being
   sinful, He must bear our sin and be numbered with the
   transgressors--and led away to die. In all things He must become a true
   Substitute for those whom He came into the world to redeem!

   And now, my Soul, come here and look at this wondrous spectacle again.
   The face of your Lord Jesus Christ is filled with spit! Was ever a
   sight so loathsome and so disgusting as this? But mark, this is your
   case. Down your cheeks something worse than spit ran--from your eyes
   there flowed something worse than came from the lips of soldiers--and
   from your mouth there has gushed forth a stream which is worse than
   that which came upon the Savior's face. Come, look at this mirror
   tonight, my dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, for the face of Christ
   is the mirror of your souls! What He endured mirrors forth what we were
   by nature. Oh, what spots there were in us! What hellish spots that
   streams of water could not wash away! What evils of every kind--pride,
   and anger, and lust, and defiance of God! Spots, did I say? Why, surely
   the sun has looked upon our faces and we have become black all over as
   the tents of Kedar. 'Tis no more with us, now, a matter of spots--by
   nature we are as the Ethiopian--black, thoroughly black! But, glory be
   unto His name, His spots have taken away our spots! This spit has made
   us clean! We are black no longer! By faith we may feel, tonight, that
   that spit on the Savior's face has washed away the sin from ours. His
   shame has taken away our sin! That spitting has taken away our guilt.
   And now what says your Lord of us? You know what sort of face He has.
   Listen to Him while He describes ours. You would scarcely think that He
   could mean it, but certainly He does, for He has seen us often and,
   therefore, He should know. He says of us, O prince's daughter--"Your
   head (Song 7:5, 6) upon you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head
   like purple: the king is held in the galleries." And again He says,
   "You are all fair, My love; there is no spot in you." When I first had
   that text laid home to my soul, well do I remember how it ravished my
   heart! I could not understand that my Lord and Master should actually
   look me in the face and say, "Lo, you are fair; there is no spot in
   you." Oh, it is a grand and noble Truth of God! Faith grasps it, love
   dotes over it, our hearts treasure it! There is no spot left in a
   Believer--

   "Covered is my unrighteousness, From condemnation I am free."

   One bath in the precious blood takes away all spots, makes us whiter
   than the driven snow and we stand before God fairest among the fair,
   accepted in the Beloved! Learn, then, O Church of Christ, this great
   Truth of God--that the spit and the shame of the Savior's face have
   delivered you from the odious corruption that disfigured you, and you
   may, therefore, rejoice in His meekness who bore your reproach!

   What Christ suffered by way of shame, we must remember, is a picture of
   what we would have suffered forever if He had not become our
   Substitute! Ah, my Soul, when you see your Lord mocked, remember that
   shame and everlasting contempt must otherwise have been forever and
   ever your portion. One of the ingredients of Hell will be shame--to be
   laughed at for our folly, to be called madmen for our sin, to feel that
   angels despise us, that God scorns us, that the righteous, themselves,
   abhor us--this will be one of the flames of the Pit that shall burn the
   spirits of men. To have no honoranywhere, not even among their base
   companions, is a bitter prospect, but there is no rank in Hell, no
   being honored in the Pit that yawns for the souls of men. "Shame shall
   be the promotion of fools, and everlasting contempt shall be their
   perpetual inheritance." And think, my Soul! This had been your portion,
   but your Master bore it for you! And now you shall never be ashamed
   because your master was ashamed for you! You shall not be confounded,
   neither shall you be put to shame, for He has taken away your reproach
   and borne it on His own visage! And as for your rebuke, it has entered
   into His own heart and He has taken it away forever--it shall never be
   brought to your remembrance. Think, dear Friends, of the honor which
   awaits the Christian, by-and-by--

   "It does not yet appear How great we must be made, But when we see our
   Savior here, We shall be like our Head."

   We shall judge the angels! The fallen spirits shall be dragged up from
   their infernal dens, and we shall sit as assessors with the Son of God,
   to say, "Amen" to that solemn sentence which shall perpetuate their
   fiery doom! We shall reign upon this earth a thousand years with Him,
   and then, clothed in white robes, our joyous spirits in our risen
   bodies shall enter triumphant into Heaven's gates! There we shall be
   crowned and treated as princes of the blood. There shall angels be our
   waiting servants and principalities and powers shall assist us in our
   service of song. Before the mighty Throne of blazing light, where God,
   Himself, reigns, we shall stand, and sing, and bow, and worship--and
   we, too, shall have our thrones and our kingdoms, and our crowns, and
   we shall reign forever and ever and ever! Then we shall look back to
   that face that was covered with spit and we shall say, "We owe all this
   to that dear disfigured face! All this glory is the result of His
   shame, because He hid not His face from shame and spitting." Therefore
   we have "washed our robes, and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb." Therefore stand we in the full blaze of Heaven's own glory and,
   therefore, we serve Jehovah day and night in His Temple! Let this sweet
   thought, then, dwell on your mind. Christ's shame has taken away your
   shame! His endurance of the spitting has secured your everlasting
   honor!

   To draw another practical Truth of God from this short but thrilling
   sentence, "They spit upon Him." Blessed Master, "if I am like You, they
   well spit on me." The less I am like You, the more the world will love
   me, but if, perhaps, these wayfarers should see something in me that
   shows I have been with You, they will give me the remnants of that spit
   which they did not spit into Your face. Oh, my Lord and Master! One
   prayer I offer, "Give me Grace to bear that spit, thankfully to receive
   it, and to rejoice because I am counted worthy not only to believe on
   You, but to suffer for Your sake!" There are many of you, I know, who
   meet the quiz and hear the laughter of your old companions when you
   forsake them to follow Christ. In the associations you have formed, and
   in your family connections, you often encounter a treatment which is
   not pleasant to flesh and blood. Does not the Evil One sometimes
   whisper to you, "Follow not with Christ, for this is a sect everywhere
   spoken against"? "Leave Him and be honored! Go not with Him, when He
   goes through Vanity Fair. Oh, do not suffer with Him this trial of
   cruel mocking." Ah, that is the song of Satan! Stop your ears to it,
   and listen not for a moment, but listen to this true note from Heaven,
   "Rejoice you in that day, and leap for joy when they shall say all
   manner of evil against you falsely for My name's sake, for so
   persecuted they the Prophets that were before you." Take joyfully not
   only the spoiling of your goods, but the spoiling of your character!
   Sing, as our sweet hymn puts it--

   "Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow Thee. Naked,
   poor, despised, forsaken, You my All from hence shall be."

   Go forth outside the camp, bearing the reproach. When at any time your
   heart sinks within you, I would have you consider Him who "endured such
   contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest you be weary and faint
   in your mind." If at any time you would hide your face from the shame
   and spitting, think you see Him enduring it, and then you will thrust
   out your face and say, "Let me be a sharer with my Master! Treat me
   like my Lord! If you spit on Him, spit on me! And rather than spit in
   His face, spit in mine! I will be glad enough if I can but shelter Him.
   It is my pride to suffer, my boast to be despised for His sake."--

   "I nail my glory to His Cross, And pour contempt on all my shame."

   Oh, this is a glory which an archangel can never know--the glory of
   being trampled on by the world for Jesus' sake! The honor of fellowship
   in suffering with Christ! And it shall be followed by a greater glory,
   still, when we shall reign with Him above, because we have suffered
   with Him below.

   To conclude, let me draw one more lesson from the fact that "They spit
   on Him." Christian Brothers and Sisters, you that love your Master,
   praise Him and extol Him. How the early Church used to talk of its
   martyrs! After those good men, who were stretched on the rack, had
   their flesh torn from their bones with red-hot pincers, they were
   exposed to the gaze of the multitude! Naked and their limbs cut away
   joint by joint, they were then burned in the fire, but stood calm and
   dared without a sigh to declare that though they were cut into a
   thousand pieces, they would never forsake their Lord and Master! How
   did the Church ring with their praises--every Christian pulpit talked
   of them, every Believer had an anecdote concerning them! And shall not
   our conversation ring with the honor of this Martyr, this glorious
   Witness, this Redeemer who thus suffered shame, and spitting and death
   on the Cross for us? Honor Him! Honor Him! Honor Him, you blood-bought
   ones! Be not content to sing--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem And crown Him Lord of all,"but bring it
   out! Make it not a matter of song, but of deed! Bring it out, and put
   it on His head! You daughters of Jerusalem, go forth to meet King
   Solomon and crown Him! Crown Him with heart and hands! Take the palm
   branches of your praises and go forth to meet Him! Spread your garments
   in the way, and cry, "Hosannah! Hosannah! Blessed is He that comes in
   the name of the Lord," leading captivity captive, and scattering gifts
   for men! Talk of Him in your houses. Laud Him in your conversation!
   Praise Him in your songs! Waft you awhile your melodies on earth, till
   you shall lay aside this clay, and enter into Heaven, there to give Him
   the fiery songs of flaming tongues! Then emulate the seraphs, and
   surround His Throne with everlasting hallelujahs, crying, "Unto Him
   that loved us, and that washed us from our sins in His blood, unto Him
   be glory forever and ever!" I think I see Him now! He stands before me!
   I see that very face that once endured the spitting. Oh, you angels!
   Bring forth the crown! Bring forth the crown and let it be put upon His
   head this day! I see the piercings, where thorns penetrated His temple.
   Bring forth the diadem, I say, and put it on His head! 'Tis done! A
   shout rises up to Heaven, louder than the voice of many waters. And
   what now? Bring forth another, and another, and another crown, and yet
   another, and another! And now I see Him. There He stands--and "on His
   head are many crowns." It is not enough! You redeemed saints, bring
   forth more! You blood-bought ones, as you stream into Heaven's gates,
   each one of you offer Him a new diadem! And you, my Soul, though "less
   than the least of all saints," and the very chief of sinners, put your
   crown upon His head! By faith, I do it now. "Unto Him that loved me,
   and that washed me from my sins in His blood, unto Him be glory forever
   and ever." From pole to pole let the echoes sound! Yes, let the whole
   earth, and all that dwell therein, say, "Amen!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN8:29-59; MARK 14:1-9; JOHN 12:1-7

   Christ thus spoke to His adversaries.

   Verse 29. And He that sent Me is with Me: the Father has not left Me
   alone: for I always do those things that please Hi . Brothers and
   Sisters, what Christ could say, I trust many of His servants can also
   say in a like manner. "He that sent me is with me." What power, what
   pleasure must the Presence of God give to His servants! "The Father has
   not left me alone." Oh, how blessed to feel that behind us is the sound
   of our Master's feet and that in us is the Temple of His Presence! We
   cannot, however, say as Christ did, "I always do those things that
   please Him," for, alas, we have the remembrance of sin this
   morning--and have to confess it in His sight. But let us also remember
   that He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.

   30, 31. As He spoke these words, many believed on Him. Then said Jesus
   to those Jews which believed on Him, If you continue in My word, then
   are you My disciples, indeed. It is not a mere profession that makes a
   man a saint--there must be a continuance of well-doing. We bind lads
   apprentice for a little time, but no man belongs to Christ unless he
   belongs to Him forever. There must be an entire giving up of one's
   self, in life and unto death, to the Lord's cause.

   32-34. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
   They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to
   any man: why do You say, You shall be made free? Jesus answered them,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of
   sin. There is this in the original, "Whoever makes sin." It is not
   exactly, "Whoever commits it," because if so, all would be the servants
   of sin and God would have no sons at all! But it says in the original
   "Whoever makes sin," that is, whoever makes it his choice, and makes it
   the delight of his soul-- whoever does this is the servant of sin and
   is no son of God.

   35. And the servant abides not in the house forever, but a son abides
   forever He may be in the house and have slender privileges for a time,
   but these soon go away.

   36. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, you shall be free,
   indeed. And give you the privileges of sons!

   37. 38. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me
   because My word has no place in you. I speak that which Ihave seen with
   My Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father Men
   always act according to their natures. We shall find the polluted
   fountain sending forth filthy streams. We do not expect to hear sweet
   singing from a serpent, nor, on the other hand, do we expect hissing
   from the bird, but every creature is after its own kind. Christ, coming
   from the Father, reveals God! Ungodly men, coming from the devil,
   reveal the devil.

   39-42. They answered and said unto Him, Abraham is our father Jesus
   said unto them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works
   of Abraham. But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the
   truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. You do the
   deeds of your father Then said they to Him. We are not born of
   fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God
   were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came
   from God; neither came I of Myself, but He sent Me. You should see in
   Me a brother. You should perceive in Me the attributes of God and,
   being made like unto God as His sons, you would love the Godhead in Me.

   43-44. Why do you not understand My speech? Even because you cannot
   hear My word. You are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your
   father you will do.Christ does not speak very gentle words at all
   times. A deeply-rooted disease needs a sharp medicine--and He gives it.
   He uses the knife, sometimes, and if there is a deadly ulcer that must
   be cut away, He knows how to do it with all the sternness of which His
   loving heart is capable.

   44. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth
   because there was no truth in him. The first murder was committed by
   his suggestion. Cain was guilty of it, but Satan instigated it. He has
   always been a man-killer and so Christ says that inasmuch as they
   sought to kill Him, they were worthy sons of their parent. "There is no
   truth inhim."

   44. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own. It is his own idiom.
   You may always know him by it. 44. For he is a liar, and the father of
   it The father of all liars and of all lies!

   45-46. And because I tell you the truth, you believe Me not Which of
   you convicts Me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe
   Me? Oh, matchless argument! Now were they silent, indeed! His whole
   life was before them. He had not lived in secret and yet He could
   appeal to his whole life--from the first day even to this time--and
   say, "Which of you convicts Me of sin?" It is this that weakens our
   testimony for God--that we are so imperfect and full of sin. Let us
   seek to imitate the Master, for the more clean we are from these
   imperfections, the more shall we be able to shut the mouths of our
   adversaries.

   47, 48. He that is of God, hears God's words. You, therefore, hear them
   not, because you are not of God. Then answered the Jews and said unto
   Him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?Always
   abuse your adversary if you cannot answer him--this is always the
   devil's tactic! When he cannot overthrow religion, then he seeks to
   append opprobrious titles to those who profess it. It is an old and
   stale trick and has lost much of its force. Our Savior did not answer
   the accusation of His being a Samaritan, but inasmuch as what they said
   about His having a devil, would touch His Doctrine--He answered that.

   49-51. Jesus answered, Ihave not a devil, but I honor My Father and you
   do dishonor Me. And I seek not My own glory: there is One that seeks
   and judges. Verily, verily, I say unto you. If a man keeps My sayings,
   he shall never see death.The sting of it shall be taken away--he may
   fall asleep--he will do so, but he shall not see death.

   52-56. Then said the Jews unto Him, Now we know that You have a devil!
   Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, and You say, If a man keeps My
   sayings, he shall never taste of death Are You greater than our father,
   Abraham, who is dead? And the Prophets who are dead? Whom do You make
   Yourself to be? Jesus answered, If I honor Myself, My honoris nothing:
   it is My Father who honors Me; of whom you say that He is your God: yet
   you have not know Him; but I know Him: and if I should say, I know Him
   not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know Him and keep His saying.
   Your father, Abraham, rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was
   glad. There is a great force in the original language here, "He was
   glad." There was an excessive joy which holy men had in looking forward
   to the coming of Christ. I do not think that we give ourselves enough
   room for joy in our religion. There are some persons who think it the
   right thing to restrain their emotions. They have no bursting forth of
   joy and seldom a shout of sacred song. But oh, my Brothers and Sisters,
   if there is anything that deserves the flashing eyes and the leaping
   feet, and the bounding heart, it is the great Truth of God that Jesus
   Christ has come into the world to save sinners, even the chief! Let us
   be glad as often as we make mention of His name.

   7. Then said the Jews unto Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and
   have You seen Abraham? Why, He was hardly thirty, but sorrow had made
   him appear older.

   58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
   Abraham was, I Am. Here He claims His Deity to the fullest extent! And
   those who can read the New Testament and profess to believe it--and yet
   not see Christ as a claimant of Deity--must be sinfully blind!

   59. Then they took up stones to cast at Him: but Jesus hid Himself and
   went out of the Temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed
   by. This is always the sinner's argument against the right! First, hard
   words, and then stones!

   MARK 14.

   Verses 1-3. After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of
   unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they
   might take Him by craft andput Him to death But they said, Not on the
   feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people. And being in Bethany,
   in the house of Simon the leper A well-known person. There were plenty
   of Simons and so they had to put another name to distinguish him. You
   remember Simon the Pharisee, in whose house Christ was anointed by a
   woman who washed His feet with tears. This is another Simon. Not Simon
   the Pharisee, but Simon the Leper. A healed man, no doubt, or he could
   not have entertained guests. There can be no question by whom he was
   healed, for there was nobody else that could heal leprosy except our
   Divine Lord. "And being at Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper."

   3. As He sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
   ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box and poured
   it on His head. It does not need any "it," "poured on His head." The
   liquid nard flowed over His locks and, as it was with Aaron, it went,
   doubtless, down His beard to the utmost skirts of His garments.

   4. And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
   said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? Matthew says that they
   were disciples. Shame on them! The ointment was put to its proper use.
   It was more wasted when it was in the box than when it was out of it,
   for it was doing nothing inside the alabaster box! But when it came
   out, it was answering its purpose. It was perfuming all round about.
   "Why was this waste of the ointment made?" When lives are lost in
   Christ's honor, or strength is spent in His service, there is no waste.
   It is what life and strength are made for-- that they may be spent for
   Him.

   5. 6. For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and
   have been given to the poor And they murmured against her, And Jesus
   said, Let her alone; why trouble her? She has worked a good work on Me.
   Or "in Me.'"

   7. For you have the poor with you always. If you help them one day,
   they are poor and they need helping the next. Or if you help them and
   leave them, leaving them because they go home to God, there are other
   poor people sure to come, for they will never cease out of the land.
   "You have the poor with you always."

   7. And whenever you will, you may do them good. But Me you have not
   always. "You can only do this for Me during the few days that I shall
   be with you. Within a week I shall be crucified. Forty more days I
   shall be gone from you. Me you have not always."

   8, 9. She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint My
   body to the burying. Verily I say unto you, Wherever this Gospel shall
   be preached throughout the whole world, this also what she has done
   shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.And it is so to this day!
   Christ's Gospel is preached, tonight, and this woman's love will be
   remembered. John also speaks of this in his 12th Chapter.

   JOHN 12.

   Verses 1, 2. Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany
   where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He raised from the dead.
   There they made Him a supper. It was in the house of Simon the Leper, a
   near acquaintance, perhaps, a relative of this beloved family, for we
   find that Martha served, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the
   table with Him. The two families had joined for this festival, and well
   they might, for in one case, someone had been healed of leprosy, and in
   the other case Lazarus had been raised from the dead! It was a holy,
   happy feast.

   2, 3. And Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the
   table with Him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very
   costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus The other Evangelist said,
   "anointed His head." And they are both right. She anointed His head and
   His feet.

   3. And wiped His feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the
   odor of the ointment. Everybody perceived and enjoyed it--and
   understood what costly ointment it must be which loads the air with so
   delicate a perfume.

   4. Then said one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which
   would betray Him. I wonder whether he was son of that Simon the Leper,
   and whether a spiritual leprosy did cling to him! That, we know, was
   the case.

   5, 6. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given
   to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because
   he was a thief and had the bag, and took what was put therei. Observe
   that the sharpest critics of the works of good men are very often no
   better than they should be. This Judas is indignant with what Mary
   does, and claims that he cares for the poor, but all the while he is a
   thief! Whenever a man is very quick condemning gracious men and women,
   you may be quite as quick in condemning him. He is usually a Judas.

Confession of Christ

   (No. 3405)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   21, 1868.

   "Whoever, therefore, shall confess Me before men, him will I confess
   before My Father who is Heaven. But whoever shall deny Me before men,
   him will I also deny before My Father who is in Heaven." Matthew
   10:32,33.

   INCESSANTLY do we preach, and do you hear, that salvation is by faith
   in Jesus Christ, that whoever trusts in Him shall be saved. This is the
   great and master-duty--the believing, the trusting. It is here that
   salvation hinges and hangs--"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ,
   is born of God." "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." We conceive
   that it is never possible to preach that Truth of God too often--that
   this ought to be in some sense the burden of every sermon--that it is
   the message, above all others, which every minister of Christ is sent
   to deliver! There is salvation in Him and in no other. We are to insist
   upon it perpetually and constantly, and never are we to forget it, that
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, even the very chief, and
   that, by Him, everyone that believes is justified from those things
   from which he could not be justified by the Law of Moses.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, there are other matters beside faith. And
   while believing in Christ is the great and the main thing, yet it would
   be unprofitable for you--it would be unfaithful on our part--if we were
   to neglect other commands of Christ which come after this foundation,
   faith, and have a very close relation to it. Now, I am persuaded that
   there are in this professing Christian England hundreds and thousands
   of persons who have some kind of faith in Christ, and I trust, also, a
   sincere one, who, nevertheless, pass over in silence the plain command
   of Christ about professing Him before men. And there may be some, even
   in this congregation gathered here, who, having given Jesus Christ
   their hearts, have been slow to think of the next thing which He
   requires, and will, perhaps, feel as though I break their quiet all too
   roughly when I shall try to press upon them that they go a step further
   and, having believed with the heart, will remember that the promise is,
   "He that with his heart believes, and with his mouth confesses, shall
   be saved." "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." The
   outward confession is as much commanded as the inward believing--the
   one the natural fruit and expression of the other.

   We shall, therefore, first of all, consider what is the duty taught
   here. And secondly, why it is a duty. And then, thirdly, what are the
   sanctions of reward and penalty appended to the performance or neglect
   of this duty

   I. WHAT IS THE DUTY HERE MENTIONED?

   "Whoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess." Observe the
   word. It is not "profess." It means that, but it means more. It is
   "confess." I take it a difference worthy of observation. To "profess"
   Christ may be work which anyone would do, especially in soft and silken
   times, when a profession may even be remunerative, when it may even add
   respectability to a man's character and make his path smooth! But the
   "confession" has this difference in it--it is a kind of thing that
   comes out when a sort of accusation is brought. A man professes Christ
   before his brethren because they will all be pleased with him for it.
   Another man in the midst of enemies, who will revile and persecute him,
   pleads guilty to the blessed impeachment of being a Christian. He
   confesses that what they count a crime, he counts a virtue--while they
   have him brought up, as it were, before their judgment seat. The crime
   alleged is that this man is a follower of Christ and, therefore, to be
   scoffed at, to be badgered and otherwise maltreated! The man says, "I
   am guilty, if it is guilt. I am thus vile, and rejoice in it--and I
   hope to be viler in it! I confess Christ, that He is mine and I am
   His." I think that is an obvious difference between profession and
   confession--there may be other differences, but we shall not be
   detained with them now. This seems to me to be clear beyond dispute. To
   "profess" Christ is but an easy thing. To "confess" Him implies that
   the circumstances make that confession a deed of courage, exposing the
   confessing soul to peril and penalty.

   But he gladly accepts the suffering or the shame, and confesses that
   what may seem to be a foolish thing to others, is a wise thing to him.
   He confesses Christ.

   I will also remark that in the Greek it is, "Whoever confesses in Me
   before men," by which is meant that he makes a confession of being in
   with Christ He holds Christ's Doctrines--desires to imbibe Christ's
   Spirit, to follow Christ's example. He does in effect say, "There are
   two sides, Sirs. You ask me which I take--I confess that I am in with
   Christ for the battle of life. I am His servant, His soldier, I will
   follow His banner and, come what may of it, I throw down the gauge of
   battle to all His adversaries. I confess in Christ. You may confess in
   the world, you may confess your love for pleasure, for wealth, for sin,
   but I will make my confession in Christ." That is, without doubt, the
   meaning of these words. It is not the profession by taking up the name
   of Christian--it is the confession, under dangerous circumstances, of
   the whole of Christ's teaching and Kingdom--and taking all the
   consequences thereof.

   Now, when ought a man to do this? It is a duty. When and how ought he
   to do it? I answer that as soon as ever a soul has believed in Christ,
   its next duty is to confess in Christ It ought never to be delayed. And
   where it has been, the delay ought to be made up by a speedy obedience.
   If you ask me what is the first confession a man ought to make, I shall
   reply that according to Scripture, it is by Baptism. As soon as ever
   the Philippian jailor had believed, Paul took him, the same hour of the
   night, and baptized him--baptized him into the name of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit! When Philip met the eunuch and had
   explained to him the Scriptures and so discipled him, the very next
   thing the eunuch said was, "See, here is water--what does hinder me to
   be baptized?" Everywhere throughout Scripture we read sentences like
   this, "They that gladly received His Word were baptized." And from the
   days of John, the precursor of Christ, to the conclusion of the history
   of the Apostle, we continually find that to all Believers the command
   was given, "Rise, and be baptized." It is the confession of Christ.
   Peter says that Baptism is "not the putting away of the filth of the
   flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God." It is a
   conscience enlightened and instructed, saying in outward symbol to God,
   "I desire to be buried with Christ and to rise with Christ--henceforth
   to be a dead man to my old self and my old sin, and being, now a new
   creature, wholly Christ's, to live alone for Him." Oh, how men have
   marred this most instructive ordinance! How they first of all put away
   the very ordinance, itself, in reducing it to drops of water which
   never could set forth as in parable or picture, a burial! How they then
   took away the proper subjects of it, and substituted unconscious
   infants for the intelligent Believer in Christ, who comes forth and
   says, "Thus I follow Christ, who in the waters of Jordan went down and
   commenced His glorious Kingdom upon the earth by Himself fulfilling
   righteousness by His Baptism there!"

   I charge you, my Brothers and Sisters, search the Scriptures! I am
   preaching to you only what Peter preached on the day of Pentecost. We
   are no inventors of this Doctrine--the grand old classic of God's
   Inspired New Testament is our warrant! And if men would cast away all
   mere ecclesiastical, habit, and once more bring everything to the test
   of the Bible, and the Bible, alone, I think they would see that the
   Scripture Baptism is an ordinance for Believers, wherein and whereby
   they confess Christ to be Savior, and Lord and King! And they devote
   themselves, their powers and influence, as well as possessions, to His
   service. I ask none of you to accept this merely because it is my
   teaching, but because it is according to the Old Book and, if so,
   accept it and obey it as Christ's Law! But the next thing every
   Believer ought to do is this--we read in the Epistle to the
   Corinthians, thus they gave--"They gave themselves first to the Lord
   and afterwards to us by the will of God." It is the duty, then, of the
   Believer in Christ to confess his Master by giving himself up to some
   Christian Church. Let him find out under whose ministry he will be best
   edified, in whose membership he can most sweetly find rest. Let him not
   be ashamed to go to that Church and say, "Receive me, I am a Brother in
   Christ." Let him not blush. Let our Sisters never blush to acknowledge
   that they have trusted in the Crucified, that they are His servants,
   that they desire now and henceforth to dwell with His people, and to be
   numbered with His disciples! Some of you, I am sure, are doing very
   wrong and losing much benefit to your own souls, by not casting in your
   lot with the people of God. "When these were met together," we read in
   the Acts of the Apostles, "they went to their own company." Birds of a
   feather flock together, and if you are a bird of Paradise, seek out
   others and say, "I cast in my lot with you--where you dwell, I will
   dwell, where you worship, I will worship--your people shall be my
   people, and your God shall be my God." Let me but be numbered with
   them, and I would rather be a doorkeeper in their assemblies than dwell
   in the tents of wickedness!

   There are two forms of confession in Christ, but after them, and yet at
   the same time, also, it behooves every Christian to make a confession
   in his family. I shall not say that you are ostentatiously to stand up
   and declare yourself a Christian in so many words. But I shall say that
   according to your position, you are to make it sufficiently known that
   you are a follower of Jesus. The servant in a family may have a very
   different way of rightly confessing Christ from that ofher master. And
   for the child, the same method might not be suitable which ought to be
   adopted by the parent. To my mind, the father ought to say, "My
   children, our household has been ill-ordered aforetime. There has been
   no prayer, no gathering as a family round the home altar. But God has
   looked upon me in mercy and now, as for me and my house, we will serve
   the Lord. My prayer shall be for you all, that you shall he saved." And
   I can imagine as the good man bowed his knee that morning, a change
   would pass over the whole constitution of his family. They would all
   ask one another, "What has happened to our father? What is this strange
   thing?" And it may be that, as it was with the jailor at Philippi, so
   it would be with the whole house--"He himself believed in God,
   rejoicing with all his house."

   But it shall be made somehow. It must be a distinct declaration made in
   some form or other by the Christian, that he is no longer what he was,
   but called out from the rest to be a follower of Jesus, "separated," as
   Paul puts it, "separated unto the Gospel of Christ."

   This confession, next, should be seen in the whole of a man's affairs.
   He is not to ticket his goods, or advertise his conversion in his shop
   window. But from that moment, if there has been anything of trickery,
   if there has been anything of foul sailing, if there has been anything
   in him that was according to the customs of the trade, but not
   according to the Laws of Christ, his immediately ceasing from all that
   without ostentation or Pharisaism is to be his confession of Christ!
   Others may continue to do the same and the customs of the trade may
   permit it. But as for him, he cannot touch the unclean thing. If he
   still continues to follow out the same customs and maxims, or if, out
   of business, he finds his pleasure and amusements in the same places as
   before. Or if, in any way, he remains exactly the same man as he was
   aforetime as to sin and wrong, then surely he has denied Christ and let
   him be baptized as he may, and join the Church as he will, he is
   nothing but a pretender and imposter, for the life does not agree with
   the confession that he is Christ's! "If any man is in Christ Jesus, he
   is a new creation, old things have passed away, and lo, allthings have
   become new!"

   There is no true confession where there is not a changed spirit and a
   transformed life, or rather the confession is such as shall suffice to
   condemn the man out of his own mouth and send him out from God's
   Presence a revealed pretender!

   My dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you members of this Church, I
   ask you to put it to your consciences! Do you confess Christ in your
   business? You working men, do you confess my Lord and Master by fleeing
   those vicious and evil habits that are so common among your class? Are
   you no longer the lover of the lewd song? Do you no longer laugh over
   the indecent story, or the one that covers vile language? Have you
   foresworn the pothouse and all the company that frequents it? And you
   merchants and you that call yourselves ladies and gentlemen, have you
   given up those frivolities, those empty vanities, those time murderers,
   those soul-destroyers of which the most of your class are so fond? If
   Divine Grace does not make you to differ from your own surroundings, is
   it really Divine Grace at all? Where there is not a thorough separation
   from the world, there is cause to fear there is no close union to
   Christ! The best part of our confession to Christ lies in the
   practically giving up everything which Christ would not sanction, and
   the following out of whatever Christ would ordain!

   Sometimes to follow Christ thus by confessing in Him will involve
   persecution. And then, let me say it will be a test point with you. We
   cannot confess Christ at all unless we are willing to give up every
   connection, however dear--every relationship, however fond--sooner than
   let the conscience bow the knee to natural affection. You are to love
   as you never loved before those that are one with you in the flesh, but
   still Christ is to be above all on your bosom's throne! Oh, there are
   some professors who do not stand to this--they have not learned the
   meaning of Christ's words, "If any man loves father, or mother, or
   husband, or child, or wife more than Me, he is not worthy of Me. And if
   any man loves house or land more than Me, he is not worthy of Me." You
   tell me there are no persecutions now? Ah, indeed, perhaps if you
   followed Christ more fully, you would find out that there were! There
   is many a timid woman who has to play the martyr, still, and many a
   trembling young Believer who has to find that if there are no burnings,
   there are trials of cruel mocking--and blessed are they that bear these
   things without fear, for the sake of Jesus! But if you flinch, if you
   are afraid of men, ah, then you count yourself unworthy and you shall
   not inherit the Kingdom of God! Oh, to go with Christ through all
   weather! To bear His Cross up the stiff hillside when the snowflakes
   sting in your face! To stand with the gentle, but heroic woman in the
   pillory! To wear the fool's cap for Christ, and so have the hoots of
   half an age about one's brow, were glory, and honor, and immortality!
   And yet many forego the honor, shrink back into their ignoble
   cowardice, counting themselves not fit to be the followers of Jesus!

   There will occasionally happen--I will only mention this and then
   conclude this first part--there will occasionally happen in the course
   of conversation, times when the confessing of Christ will become to the
   Christian an imperative duty--as when coarse infidelity is being
   avowed, or the Gospel of Jesus derided.

   I do not say that you are always to speak, for sometimes it would be
   casting pearls before swine. But I will say that if any unholy
   cowardice will make you hold your tongue and keep silence when you
   might have spoken for your Master's name, you have need to confess this
   sin with bitter tears and trembling, lest that denial should not be the
   denial of Peter, for which there is forgiveness after sore
   repentance--but the denial of Judas, which followed only by remorse,
   made him the son of perdition. Oh, stand up for Jesus! To be ashamed to
   acknowledge yourself a Christian, ah, then Christianity may well be
   ashamed of you! I know that is not the name--it is Presbyterian,
   Puritan, Methodist, hypocrite--oh, confess the impeachment whatever it
   may be! If they choose to make even the term, "hypocrite," a synonym
   for Christian, tell them that by the way which they call hypocrisy,
   even so do you in all sincerity worship the Lord God of your fathers!
   Be bold enough to stand in the front rank for Christ and never hide
   yourself behind for fear of feeble man! He is worthy to be confessed,
   so dare to confess Him, I beseech you! Thus much in explanation of the
   duty argument for it.

   II. WHY IS IT A DUTY?

   To be very brief, first, the genius of the Christian religion requires
   it The genius and spirit of the Christian religion is, first, light.
   Everything is above board with Christianity. We have no mysteries which
   are only revealed to a special few. We are not like those teachers of
   philosophy who keep their tenets for the initiated. The religion of
   Jesus Christ, as far as men are able to comprehend it, is as plain as a
   pikestaff. We, my Brothers and Sisters, have no learned books to which
   to point you and say, "There is the secret locked up in the dead
   languages. And there in the process of reading some twenty tomes, you
   may fish out the secret almost as clearly as the secret of alchemy."
   No, but here is our secret-- Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was made
   flesh, died for sinners, the Just for the unjust, and whoever believes
   in Him shall be saved! If there is any mystery, it is only because
   there must be something mysterious in that which comes of God and tells
   of Him. But the Gospel never aims at mystery!

   The old Church of Rome has written upon her brazen brow, "Mystery.
   Babylon. Mother of Harlots!" But the Church of Jesus Christ says in the
   language of Paul, "We use great plainness of speech." Now, where the
   very spirit and genius of Christianity is openness, bold display, a
   keeping back of nothing--it seems to be natural that every Believer in
   it should never keep in concealment in his own breast his conviction,
   but should publish upon the housetop that which he has received!

   Again, the genius of our religion is life, as well as light. Life is
   sure, ultimately, to be revealed. It cannot be altogether hidden. It is
   sure to sprout from the seed, though buried deep in the earth. Our
   religion is not a thing of churches, and Sundays, and Good Fridays, and
   Easters, and Christmases and I know not what besides! It is a thing of
   everyday life, for the kitchen and the parlor, the office and factory,
   the court ofjustice, the Houses of Parliament. It intertwists itself
   with all the rootlets of our inner nature and comes out in all our
   actions of outward behavior and conversation. Hence, to hide it is
   impossible! "He could not be hid," should be as true of our Christian
   life as it was of our Lord. If it were a mere ceremony, it might be
   performed in and confined to crypt or sepulcher--but since religion is
   a principle which acts upon the entire life--it ought to be and must be
   confessed!

   The genius of our religion is also fire. Light, life, fire, by which I
   mean energy, Divine energy. The Christian is, above all, a
   propagandist. He it is who, having a better Truth than the Pharisees
   ever had, excels them in the missionary spirit. He will compass sea and
   land to make one proselyte, for the flaming religion of Jesus Christ
   can never be kept in the bosom of the man who receives it. Even fire
   cannot be kept still, for once it falls among the stubble, the
   conflagration must spread. The God that answers by fire is a God who
   shall reign over this world! And the God of Christianity is that God of
   fire! Hence, Beloved, since you are expected to operate upon others by
   your life and teaching, you must not dream of concealing your faith,
   for your religion requires it.

   In the next place, genuine love dictates it Ashamed of Jesus who bought
   you with His blood, forgave you all your sins, made you a child of God?
   Oh, by the five wounds, and by the glorious passion, and the bloody
   sweat and the travail of His soul, by the hands that bore your name in
   Heaven, by the heart that beats with love for you, how can you deny
   Him? Beloved in the heart of Jesus--

   "When you blush be this your shame, That you no more revere His name."
   But never, never be ashamed of one so dear to you. Love inspires it.

   But gratitude also requires it. Surely, Brothers and Sisters, those
   that are converted to God owe no small gratitude to the Church of
   Christ, which was the instrument, in most cases, of their conversion.
   How can we prove that gratitude so well as by assisting that Church in
   all its work, that others, also, may be blessed? When I think of some
   Christians who say they love Christ but have never joined the Church, I
   put it to them, "Suppose everybody else did the same--everyother
   Christian has the same rights as yourself--suppose, then, that all
   Christians should refuse to join in Church organization--how would
   there be any hope for the world?" "Oh," you say, "all others may do
   it!" No, if you may neglect it, others may. Was it not through some
   minister of Christ that you first heard the Gospel? Was it not through
   the Sunday school or through some printed word that you first came to
   know Christ? Repay the debt you owe to the Church by casting in your
   lot with your fellow Christians and seeking to do the same for some
   other, who, as yet, is unrenewed by Grace.

   Prudence, also, let me say, suggests it to you. "Prudence," you answer,
   "why, I thought it was prudence to keep out of the Church, for fear I
   should dishonor Christ." That is imprudence! For it is going on your
   own way, a road Christ never marked for you. The truest prudence is to
   do exactly what the Master bids, for then, if anything should come
   amiss, you are not accountable for it. "But," you say, "suppose I
   should dishonor Christ?" Yes, and suppose you are dishonoring Christ
   now? I think you had better run that risk than take the absolute
   certainty that you are dishonoring Him by your disobedience! "Well,"
   says one, "if I were to avow myself a Christian, I should feel it such
   a solemn thing." Therefore, do it--for we need solemn things to keep us
   back from sin. "I should feel it such a bond to keep me in holiness."
   You require such a bond--accept it, and it shall be no more a chain to
   you, if you are sincere, than wings are a burden to a bird, or sails
   become a clog to a ship--

   "Take His easy yoke and wear it, Love will make the burden light! Grace
   will teach you how to bear it, You shall bear it with delight." But,
   Beloved in Christ, for your own good's sake, be not slow to do what
   your Master bids. One other word will suffice. Over and above all other
   reasoning comes this--Christ requires it. Hear you His words tonight.
   Mine are but feeble, but let His roll in your souls like thunder,
   "Whoever shall confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My
   Father who is in Heaven; but whoever shall deny Me before men, him will
   I also deny before My Father who is in Heaven."

   Now, mark from the connection that denial means "whoever shall
   notconfess." The two verses are put in apposition and opposition. There
   is a blessing to the confessor. The curse is to the non-confessor.
   "Whoever shall not confess Me"-- for that is the denying here
   meant--"before men, him will I deny before My Father who is in Heaven."
   Will you willfully disobey the Master you profess to serve? Will you
   raise quibbles to His face and questions in His very Presence? They are
   His words! They can bear no other meaning. They are not to be disputed,
   but to be obeyed! These are not the decrees of the Council of Trent, or
   you might fling them to the winds. They are not the ordinances of a
   bench of bishops, or you might tread them under foot. These are not the
   commands of any minister of any sect, or you might, if you would,
   reject them! But they are the royal, authoritative words of Jesus
   Christ Himself! I charge you, by your loyalty to your King--I charge
   you by your indebtedness to your Redeemer--I charge you by your love to
   Him whom you call Master and Lord, if hitherto you have not confessed
   Him, make haste and delay not to keep His commandment and acknowledge
   Him, that He may acknowledge you! And never be ashamed of Him again,
   lest at the last He should be ashamed of you!

   I shall urge no other reason. If that last convinces not, the spirit of
   obedience is lacking. And I would not even ask any of you to confess
   Christ if you did not mean to obey Him. Were it otherwise, I would say,
   "Stand back! Stand back! If you do not love Him, He has never washed
   you from your sins! If He is not your Savior. If you have never been
   born-again. If you are not truly His servant in the name of God, do not
   touch Baptism, or His Supper! Never come to the Communion Table if you
   have no right there! Profess not to be a Christian if you are not! And
   say not, "Our Father who are in Heaven," for your Father is not in
   Heaven--you have no part or lot in this matter, you are in the gall of
   bitterness and bond of iniquity and, harsh as the words may sound,
   these words are true, "Repent, and be converted," that you may obtain
   these blessings. Fly to Christ and trust in Him, for until you do, you
   have no right to the ordinances of God's house! There is no room for
   you in God's family! You are not His child, but an alien, a stranger,
   an outcast! May the Lord, in His mercy, bring you to know it, and then
   bring you to Jesus, and adopt you into His household--and you will give
   Him the praise!

   Now, the last thing is to be treated with brevity, but great solemnity
   because we are to enquire--

   III. WHAT ARE THE REWARDS AND PENALTIES ATTACHED TO THIS DUTY?

   Here we have two sanctions. "He that confesses Me before men, him will
   I confess before My Father who is in Heaven." Take this sentence home
   with you, everyone of you. What Christ is to you on earth, that you
   will be to Christ in Heaven. I shall repeat that Truth of God. Whatever
   Jesus Christ is to you on earth, you will be to Him in the Day of

   Judgment. If He is dear and precious to you, you will be precious and
   dear to Him. If you thought everything of Him, He will think everything
   of you. There are in my text, it appears to me, two Judgment Seats.
   There is one on which you sit and there is one before you, which is
   better. Shall I take the world--the world which contemns two things--it
   contemns civil vices and holy duties! Shall I take the world, which
   will call me a bigot, a fanatic, if I go with Christ? Shall I take the
   world with its pleasures and amusements? Shall I take it with its sins
   and laxities of morals, with its looseness and general trifling? Shall
   I take that, or shall I take my Lord and Master, and be thought a fool
   because I dare not, cannot do as others do? Shall I keep in the narrow
   path which He has mapped out? Which shall it be? I believe that
   salvation is of Grace, but there is such a thing as a human will, and
   God does not violate it. There is a time when every man sits just on
   that Judgment Seat and, blessed be he to whom God gives Grace to say--

   "Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow You."

   On that judgment which you now make, sitting on that judgment seat
   here, humanly speaking, will depend that other judgment from the other
   Judgment Seat of the Great White Throne! I think I see the Master. He
   has come in the clouds of Heaven. Listen how the silver trumpets ring!
   The dead are rising; the pillars of Heaven are shaking; stars are
   falling; solemnities, unseen before, attend the dread assize and the
   books are opened and every soul may be judged by this one thing--did he
   confess Christ before men? Did he call Christ his Master in his heart,
   and give himself up to His cause? "Then I confess that he is Mine and
   though he were poor and despised, rotted in a dungeon, or was burnt at
   the stake amidst execrations--I confess him--he is Mine! He said that I
   was his and now I say in return that he is Mine! He judged that he
   would take Me. I judged that I have taken him. He confessed Me. I
   confess him!

   But see the other--see the timorous wretch who knew something about
   Christ, but knew too much about the world--who loved the silver of
   Demas, or the pleasures of Jezebel--let him come forward.

   What is the Master's sentence about him? It is very short, but very
   full, "I never knew you." They did not know Christ on earth--and now He
   does not know them. He is the only Savior, and that only Savior does
   not know them. They were the gay party, and there was much ridicule
   poured upon belief in Christ. The gay young lady thought that she must
   take her share in this, or she might be suspected of falling in with
   the despised people of God. She did not know Christ. No, and He will
   not know her in that day when the beauty will have gone from her cheeks
   and the Grace and charm will have departed from her form! Yes, that man
   of business who was talking the other day with his fellows, and the
   conversation turning upon religion, there was some joke made against
   the Gospel, or some of its sacred Doctrines--and though he knew it was
   wrong and mean, he thought he must joke, too, unless he should be
   thought to be one of the class who follow Jesus of Nazareth! He was too
   respectable to know Christ, and Christ will be too respectable to know
   him! Let me say to all the counts and countesses, the dukes and
   duchesses, the royal highnesses and royal personages of all
   denominations that are fretting out their little hour--the true dignity
   will be to know Christ! And the true horror to be unknown of Him! Oh,
   happy shall that man be whose name was handed down from man to man
   amidst scorn, shame and spitting, because he took Christ's part. "Stand
   back, you angels!" the King will say. "Stand back, you seraphim and
   cherubim! Make way for him! He loved Me in the days of My scorn. He
   suffered for Me on earth. I know him. My Father, I confess him before
   You in Heaven amidst the glories of My Throne! I confess him before
   You--he is Mine." But the apostate, the turncoat, the careless, the
   non-confessing, whatever are their dignities, and names, and honors,
   and glories here-- though the world's church may count them good and
   offer a song for them beneath its domes--if they have not trusted
   Christ with their own heart and have not loved Him with their own soul,
   it shall be all in vain! Though they have been decorated and almost
   adored, Christ shall turn coldly upon them with, "I never knew you!"
   "But, Lord, we ate and drank in Your courts!" "I know you not! Depart
   from Me." "But, Lord! Are we then to be forever banished from Your
   Presence?" "I never knew you! Your loss is eternal--your ruin must be
   final."

   Choose you, this night, whom you will serve! By the living God, before
   whom I stand, I beseech you this night, decide for Christ! If God is
   God, serve Him. If the Devil is God, serve him. One way or the other!
   If Jesus Christ is worthy of your love, let Him have it and take up
   your cross. But if He is not, then trifle with religion and go on your
   way.

   But I cannot finish so. Consider, think and turn unto Him with full
   purpose of heart. Give yourselves to Him. Unite yourselves with God's
   people, wherever you may find them. Cast in your lot with the lovers of
   Jesus in whatever Christian denomination you may happen to meet with
   them. The Lord bless you and them--and acknowledge you in the day when
   He shall appear! May God add His solemn sanction, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   MATTHEW 10:16-23.

   Verse 16. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
   you, therefore, wise as serpents and harmless as doves. It is a strange
   errand that you are sent upon--not as dogs to fight with wolves. Yet
   you are to fight with them, but you are to go as lambs in the midst of
   wolves! Expect, therefore, that they will rend you. Bear much, for even
   in that you shall conquer! If they kill you, you shall be honored in
   your death. As I have often said, the fight looks very unequal between
   sheep and wolves, yet at the present moment there are vastly more sheep
   in the world than wolves, the sheep having outlived the wolves. In this
   country, at any rate, the last wolf is gone and the sheep, with all
   their weaknesses, continue to multiply. "That is due," you say, "to the
   shepherd." And to Him shall your safety and your victory be due! He
   will take care of you. "I send you forth as sheep among wolves." But do
   not, therefore, provoke the wolves. "Be wise as serpents." Have a holy
   prudence. "Be as harmless as doves," but not as silly as doves.

   17-19. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
   and they will scourge you in their synagogues. And you shall be brought
   before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them
   and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or
   what you shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what
   you shall speak. And very remarkable were the answers given by the
   martyrs to those who persecuted them! In some cases they were
   altogether unlettered men, feeble women--unused to the quibbles and the
   catches which ungodly wise men use--and yet with a holy ability they
   answered all their adversaries and often stopped their mouths! It is
   amazing what God can make of the weakest of men when He dwells in them
   and speaks through them!

   20, 21. For it is not you that speaks, but the Spirit of your Father
   who speaks in you. And the brother shall deliver up the brother to
   death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against
   their parents and cause them to be put to death. Strange venom of human
   nature! It never grows so angry against anything as against God's
   Truth. Why is this? False religions will tolerate one another, but they
   will not tolerate the religion of Christ! Is not this all accounted for
   by that old dark saying at the gates of Eden, "I will put enmity
   between you and the woman--between your seed and her Seed." That enmity
   is sure to come up as long as the world stands.

   22, 23. And you shall be hated of all men for My name's sake: but he
   that endures to the end shall be saved. But when they persecute you in
   this city, flee you into another, for verily I say unto you, You shall
   not have gone over the cities ofIsrael till the Son of Man is come.
   They had not been able to get all through Palestine before the
   destruction of Jerusalem. Perhaps we shall scarcely have been able to
   preach the Gospel in every part of the world before our Master's speedy
   footsteps shall be heard.

Fullness of Joy Our Privilege

   (No. 3406)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 14, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And these things we write unto you, that your joy may be full." 1 John
   1:4.

   VERY closely does the Apostle John resemble his Lord in the motive that
   prompted him to write this Epistle! You remember how Christ said in His
   last discourse to His disciples on the eve of His passion, "These
   things have I spoken unto you that your joy may be full"--and how He
   counseled them, "Ask and receive that your joy may be full"--and how He
   prayed to the Father for them, "that they might have My joy fulfilled
   in themselves." Here, then, the beloved disciple, moved by the Spirit
   of God, reflects and follows out the same gracious purpose--"These
   things we write unto you, that your joy may be full." What an evidence
   of our Savior's deep attachment to His people that He is not content
   with having made their ultimate salvation sure, but He is anxious
   concerning their present state of mind! He delights that His people
   should not only be safe, but happy! Not merely saved, but rejoicing in
   their salvation! It does not please your Savior for you to hang your
   head as the bulrush and go mourning all your days. He would have you
   rejoice in Him always and for this end He has made provision and to
   this end He has given us precepts. Therefore it appears--

   I. THAT THE CHRISTIAN'S JOY NEEDS LOOKING AFTER.

   We should not find the Apostle John writing to promote that which, in
   the natural order of things, would be sure to occur. In this object of
   pastoral anxiety, he seems to include the whole of the Apostolic
   College with himself when he says, "These things we write unto you that
   your joy might be full," as if your joy would not be full unless
   Inspired Apostles should be commissioned of God to further it. Your joy
   then, I say, needs looking after. I do not doubt but you have very
   suggestive proofs of this, yourselves, in your external circumstances.
   You cannot always rejoice because, although your treasure is not in
   this world, your affliction is. Poverty will sometimes be too heavy a
   cross for you to sing under. Sickness sometimes casts you upon a bed on
   which you have not, as yet, learned to rejoice. Losses befall you in
   business, failures of hope, forsaking of friends and cruelty of
   foes--and any of these may prove like winter nights which nip the green
   leaves of your joy and make them fade and fall off your branches. You
   cannot always rejoice, but sometimes there is a necessity that you
   should be in heaviness through manifold temptations. I suppose none of
   you are so perfectly happy as to be without some trial. Your joy will
   need to be looked after, then, lest floods should come in and quench
   it. You will need to cry to Him who alone can keep its flame burning,
   to trim it with fresh oil.

   I suppose, too, that you have moods and susceptibilities which make it
   no easy matter to maintain perpetual joy. If you have not, I have.
   Sometimes there will be deep depression of spirit--you can scarcely
   tell why. That strong wing with which you mounted like an eagle will
   seem to flap the air in vain. That heart of yours, which once flew
   upwards like the lark rising from amidst the dew, will lie cold and
   heavy like a stone upon the earth, and you will find it hard to
   rejoice.

   Besides, sin will stop the beginning of your holy mirth, and when you
   would dance for joy, like David before the Ark, some internal
   corruption will come to hamper your delight. Ah, Beloved, it is not
   easy to sing while you fight. Christian soldiers ought to do it--they
   should march to battle with songs of triumph, that their spirits may be
   nerved to desperate valor against their inbred corruptions, but
   sometimes the garment rolled in blood and the dust, and the turmoil
   will stop for awhile the looked for shout of victory. With trials many
   and manifold--trials from the thorns and briars of this fallen world,
   trials from Satanic suggestions, trials from the uprisings of black
   fountains of corruption within your own polluted hearts--you have,
   indeed, need that your joy, to keep it full and flowing at high tide,
   should be guarded and supplied by an influence above your own--and fed
   from a celestial spring!

   I dare say you have learned by this time, my Beloved in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, how exceedingly necessary it is that this joy of ours should be
   abundant. When full of joy, we are more than a match for the adversary
   of souls, but when our joy is gone, fear slackens our sinews, and, like
   Peter, we may be vanquished by a little maid! When our joy in the Lord
   is at its fullest, we can bear that the fig tree should not blossom,
   that the herd should be cut off from the stall and the flocks from the
   field, but how heavy our sorrows are to bear, how impatient we become
   when the chains that link Heaven and earth are disarranged, or the
   communication in any way intercepted. If we can see the Savior's face
   without a cloud between, then temptation has no power over us, and all
   the glittering shams that sin can offer us are eclipsed in their
   brilliance by the true gold of spiritual joy which we have in our
   possession. Oh, what rapture!--

   "I would not change my blest estate

   For all that earth calls good or great!

   And while my faith can keep her hold,

   I envy not the sinner's gold." Thus the Christian, by his holy joy,
   outbraves temptation and is strong to endure a martyrdom of vice. Why,
   you can do anything when the joy of the Lord is within you! Like a roe
   or a young hart, you leapt over the mountains of Bether. The mountains
   cannot appall you--you make a stepping-stone across the brook. The
   heaviest tempests which lower over you cannot chill nor dampen your
   courage, for your song pierces it, and your soul mounts above it all
   into the clear blue of fellowship with your God! But when this joy is
   gone, then are we weak, like Samson when his hair was shorn. We become
   the slaves of temptation and if we do not yield to its treacherous
   enticements, at any rate, it harasses us, and so enervates the power
   with which we were known to glorify our God. The Christian's joy needs
   looking to. If any of you have lost the joy of the Lord, I pray you do
   not think it a small loss. I have heard of a minister who said that a
   Christian lost nothing by sin--and then he added--"except his joy." And
   one replied, "Well, and what else would you have him lose?" That is
   quite enough! To lose the light of my Father's Countenance. To lose my
   full assurance of interest in Christ. To lose my Heaven below--oh, this
   is a loss great enough! Let us walk carefully, let us walk prayerfully
   so that we may realize perpetual joy and peace even to the fullest! Let
   none of us be content to sit down in misery. There is such a thing as
   getting habituated to melancholy. My bias is toward that state of mind,
   but, by the Grace of God, I resist it. If we begin to give way to this
   foolishness, we shall soon weave forged chains for ourselves which we
   cannot readily snap. Take your harp from the willows, Believers. Do not
   let your fingers forget the well-known strings. Come, let us praise
   Him. If we have looked black in the face for awhile, let us brighten up
   with the thoughts of Christ! At any rate, let us not be easy till we
   have shaken off this lethargic distemper and once again come into the
   normal state of health in which a child of God should be found--that of
   spiritual joy!

   II. THE CHRISTIAN'S JOY LIES MAINLY IN THINGS REVEALED, otherwise it
   would not find its fitting sustenance in Inspired Words.

   If the Christian's joy lay in the wine vat and in the barn, in the
   landed estate, or the hoarded purse, it would only be necessary that
   the vineyard should yield plenteous clusters, that the harvest should
   be crowned with abundance, that peace should prevail and trade should
   prosper--and forthwith the heritor and the merchant have all that heart
   could wish. But the Christian's joy is not touched by these vulgar
   things. These commonplace satisfactions do not suit the noble mind of
   the Believer! He thanks God for all the bounties of the basket and the
   barn, but he cannot feast his soul upon stocks or fruits that perish
   with the using. He needs something better! The Apostle John seems to
   tell us this when he says, "And these things write I unto you"--nothing
   about prosperity in this world, but all about fellowship with
   Christ--"And these things we write unto you, that your joy may be
   full." From which I infer that everything which is revealed to us in
   Scripture has for its intention the filling up of the Christian's joy.

   What is Scripture all about, then? Is it not, first and foremost,
   concerning Jesus Christ? Take this Book and distil it into one word,
   and I will tell you what it is--it is JESUS! All this is but the body
   of Christ. I may look upon all these pages as the swaddling-bands of
   the infant Savior, and if you unroll Scripture, you come to Jesus
   Christ, Himself. Now, Beloved, is not Jesus Christ the sum and summit
   of your joy? I hope we do not utter a falsehood when we sing, as it is
   our custom--

   "Jesus the very thought of Thee, With rapture fills my breast,
   Tho'sweeter far Your face to see,

   And in Your bosom rest."

   Jesus--Man yet God--allied to us in ties of blood. Why, here is mirth!
   Here is Christmas all the year round! In the Nativity of the Savior
   there is joy for us--the Babe born in Bethlehem--God has taken Man into
   communion with Himself! Jesus the Savior--here is release from the
   groans of sin! Here is an end to the means of despair! He comes to
   break the bars of brass and to cut the gates of iron in sunder--

   "Jesus, the name that charms our fears,

   That bids our sorrows cease!

   'Tis music in the sinner's ears,

   'Tis life, 'tis health, 'tispeace!" Scripture, surely, has well taken
   its cue! Would it make us joyful, it has done well to make Christ its
   head and front.

   All the doctrines of the Bible have a tendency, when properly
   understood and received, to foster the Christian's joy. Let us mention
   one or two of them. There is that ancient, much-abused, but most
   delightful Doctrine of Election, that "all worlds before," Jesus
   elected His people and looked with eyes of Infinite Love upon them as
   He saw them in the glass of futurity. What? Christian, can you believe
   yourself "loved with an everlasting love," and not rejoice? Was it not
   the Doctrine of Election that made David dance before the Ark? When
   Michel sneered at him for dancing, he said, "It was before the Lord who
   had chosen me before your father (Saul), and all his house." Surely to
   be chosen of God, to be selected from the mass of mankind and made
   favorites of the heart of Deity--this ought to make us, in our worst
   moments, sing with joy of heart! Oh, that Doctrine of Election! I wish
   some of you would acquaint yourselves with it in the Psalmody of the
   Church, rather than in the wrangling of the schools! It is a tree that
   puts forth its luxuriance in the tropical climate of Divine Love--but
   it looks dwarfed and barren in the arctic regions of human logic! Then
   there are the Doctrines which like living waters, drop from this sacred
   and hidden fountain. Take, for instance, that of Redemption. To be
   bought with a price--a price whose efficacy is not questionable--bought
   so that we are now the property of Jesus, never to be lost! Bought not
   with that general redemption which holds to the sinner's eye a
   precarious contingency, but bought with an effectual ransom which saves
   every blood-bought sinner because he was redeemed--his own proper self,
   of God's own good will! Oh, here is occasion for song!--

   "Jesus sought me when a stranger,

   Wandering from the fold of God--

   He to rescue me from danger,

   Interposed His precious blood." Can you see the blood-mark on yourself,
   and not rejoice? Oh, Christian, surely your joy ought to be full! Or
   turn to the Doctrine of Justification and consider how, through faith,
   every Believer is "accepted in the Beloved," and stands, wrapped in
   Jesus' righteousness, as fair in God's sight as if he had never sinned.
   Why, here is a theme for joy! Know and acknowledge your union with
   Christ--

   "One with Jesus,

   By eternal union one!"

   Members of His body, "of His flesh, and of His bones," and what?--not a
   song after this? How sweet the music ought to be where this is the
   theme! Then, too, to mention no more, there is one Doctrine which is
   like a handful of pearls--that of Eternal Preservation unto Glory which
   is to be revealed at the appearing of Jesus Christ. You are "kept by
   the power of God through faith unto salvation." You shall be with Him
   where He is. You shall behold His Glory. "Whom He justified, them He
   also glorified." Oh, can you put on this robe of splendor and go up to
   the Throne where Christ has already made you sit representatively in
   His own Person, and can you not begin, tonight, your song which shall
   never end? Truly we have but to mention a Truth of God and you can
   think it over for yourselves--every Doctrine of Revelation is to the
   Christian a source of joy!

   Well, and every part of Christian experience is to further our joy.
   "Why," says one, "all a Christian's experience is not joyful." I grant
   you that, but remember that all a Christian's experience is not
   Christian experience! Christians experience a great deal which they do
   not experience as Christians--but experience it because they are not
   such Christians as they ought to be! I believe that much of that
   groaning which some people think such a deal of, is rather of the devil
   than of the Spirit of God. Certainly that unbelief which some people
   seem to look upon as such a precious flower, is rank herbage, never
   sown in us by the hand of God the Holy Spirit! Beloved, there is a
   mourning which comes from the Spirit of God that is a joyful mourning,
   if I may use such a strange expression. Sorrow for sin is sweet sorrow.
   I would never wish to miss it. I think Rowland Hill was right when he
   said that it would be his only regret in going to Heaven that he could
   not repent any more. Oh, repentance, true evangelical repentance, is
   not that half-bitter thing which comes from the Law! It is a sweet
   genial thing. I do not know, Beloved, when I am more perfectly happy
   than when I am weeping for sin at the foot of the Cross! I find that to
   be one of the safest and best places where I can stand. I have
   sometimes thought that the raptures of Communion I have known are not
   altogether so deep--though they may be higher--not, I say, so deep as
   the pensive joy of weeping over pardoned sin, when--

   "Dissolved by His goodness, I fall to the ground

   And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found!" Yes, sorrow for sin is
   a part of the Christian's experience which helps to fill his joy. And
   though your cares and anxieties, dear Friends, with regard to the
   things of this world may be very distressing, yet remember, in every
   drop of gall which your Father gives you to drink, there is, if you can
   find it, a whole sea of sweetness! God sends you trials to wean you
   from the world--a happy result, however grievous the process! Oh, that
   I might never desire to suck of the breasts of her consolation anymore!
   Oh, to come to Christ, and find my all in Him! Believe me, Beloved, our
   joy ends where the love of the world begins. If we had no idols on
   earth--if we made neither our children, nor our friends, nor our
   wealth, nor ourselves our idols--we should not have half the trials
   that we have. Foolish loves make rods for foolish backs. God save us
   from these, and when He does, though the means may seem severe, they
   are intended to promote our joys by destroying the eggs of our sorrows.
   But there is much of a Christian's experience that is all joy, and must
   be all joy. For instance, to have faith in Christ, to rest in Him--is
   not that joy? To sing from one's heart--

   "I know that safe with Him remains,

   Protected by His power,

   What I've committed to His hands,

   Till the decisive hour." Is not that joy? And even that humbler note--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring,

   Simply to Your Cross I cling," has the germ of Heaven in it! Truly,
   there can be no more delightful place for the soul to stand than close
   to the Cross, covered with the crimson drops of blood and clasping
   Christ Himself! And then hope is another part of the Christian's
   experience. What a fountain of joy it is! We are saved by hope. Sweetly
   does the Psalmist express himself, "My soul faints for Your salvation,
   but I hope in Your Word." To the followers of Christ there is a full
   assurance of hope--"which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both
   sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil." Above
   all things, Christian fellowship is the chief auxiliary of Christian
   joy. Read the verse that immediately precedes our text, "That which we
   have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have
   fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
   with His Son, Jesus Christ." Ah, now we hit the mark! This is the
   center of the target. Fellowship with Christ is the summum bonum--it
   fills up the measure of joy! All other graces and gifts may help to
   fill our cup of blessedness but fellowship with saints in their
   fellowship with the Father and the Son--surely this, of itself, must
   suffice to fill our vessels to the very brim! Fullness of joy! Did you
   ever prove it, my Beloved? I think some of you have. No, I know you
   have! You could not have contained more joy--you were full to
   overflowing! Do you know that a little joy is healthful? Be it relief
   from anxiety, pleasure after pain, or even a cheerful thought in
   breasts to sorrow prone. But to have a fullness of joy, joy that
   pulsates through our every nerve and paints the entire universe of
   God's goodness before our eyes in a meridian glow, this is a myriad of
   blessings in one! If I held in my hand a glass, and poured water into
   it till it were full, right to the very brim, till it seemed as if the
   least touch would make it run over--well, that is how the Christian
   sometimes is. "Why," he says, "I could not feel more happy! If anyone
   should make me rich, if I could have all that the worldling craves, I
   could not be any happier! I am rich to all the intents of bliss since
   You, God, are mine." It is not every man that can go home and say,
   "There is nothing on earth I want, and there is nothing in Heaven that
   I yearn after beyond the endowments my God has already bestowed on me!
   "Whom have I in Heaven but You, and who is there upon earth I desire
   beside You?" Go, you that pine for joy, and traverse the wide earth
   round in fruitless search--my soul sits down at the foot of the Cross
   and says, "I have found it here!" Go, like the swallow. Fly across the
   purple seas to find another summer now that this is over--my soul would
   stop just where she is--living at the foot of the Cross, my sunis in
   its solstice, and stands still forever--never stirring, never
   moving--without parallax or shadow of a tropic! Evermore the
   same--bright and full and glorious! Oh, Christian, this is a blessed
   experience! May you know it all your life!

   Never doubt, my dear Friends, that every precept in the Word of God is
   intended to further the Christian's happiness. When I read the Ten
   Commandments, I understand them to be just and salutary directions not
   to do myself any harm. The spirit of the Law seems to be benevolent in
   its warnings. If I were commanded not to put my finger into the fire,
   and did not know that fire would burn, I ought to be thankful for the
   prohibition. If I were commanded not to plunge into the sea, not having
   known before that the sea would drown me, I should be thankful for the
   interdict. God's precepts are designed to enlighten our eyes and
   preserve our feet from falling. They forbid what is dangerous, hurtful.
   God never denies His servants anything that is really for their good.
   His laws are freed-men's rules--they are never fetters to the
   Christian. And as for the precepts of our blessed Christianity, they,
   every one of them, promote our happiness! Let me take one or two of
   them. "Love one another." That is the first. Well, now, when are you
   happiest? When you feel spiteful and bitter towards everybody else, or
   when you feel charity towards the faulty, and love towards your fellow
   servants? I know when I feel best. There are some people who seem to
   have been suckled upon vinegar--wherever they go, they always see some
   defect. Were there to be men on earth again such as Chrysostom and
   others of his day, who have been portrayed in history, or like the
   Nazarites of Jeremiah's plaintive hymn, "Purer than snow and whiter
   than milk," they would say, "Ah, well, though their reputation is
   unsullied, we do not know what they do in secret!--we cannot scan their
   motives!" Some people are always in a cynical, suspicious humor, but
   they who "love one another" can see much to rejoice in everywhere. We
   are told in Scripture to "serve the Lord with diligence," and I am sure
   it is "the diligent soul" that is made fat. The do-nothing people are
   generally those who say--

   "Lord, what a wretched land is this, That yields us no supplies."

   It ought to be a wretched land to lazy people! Those that will not
   work, neither shall they eat, neither in spiritual things or in
   temporal shall they be fed. If, in the winter, you complain of cold,
   get to the plow and you will soon be full of warmth! Sit you down,
   groan, and complain, and blow on your blue fingers and you shall soon
   find the cold will starve you yet more and more. Holy activity is the
   mother of holy joy! And growth in Grace, again--why, when is a man
   happier than when He grows in Grace? To be at a standstill, to contract
   one's self--why, this is misery! To force one's understanding, like a
   Chinese foot into a Chinese shoe, is torture! But to have a mind that
   is capable of learning, to be able to sometimes say, "There, I was
   wrong"--to be able to feel that you know a little more today than you
   did yesterday because God, the Holy Spirit has been teaching you, why,
   this is joy! This is happiness! This is such as God would have us know!

   All the writings of Scripture, whether they are doctrinal,
   experimental, or practical, have the drift which John indicates in
   these words, "That your joy may be full!" Having thus shown that the
   Christian's joy needs looking after and that it is mainly fed upon
   things revealed in Scripture, the inference clearly must be that--

   III. WE SHOULD CONSTANTLY READ THE SCRIPTURES.

   Read the Scriptures in preference to any other book What a deal of
   reading there is now-a-days! But how large a proportion of what you
   call, "popular literature," is mere chaff-cutting--nothing more! Why, I
   am really ashamed to state the fact that I am bound, as a Christian
   minister, to denounce. You cannot publish a religious newspaper, or a
   religious magazine, as a rule, to make it pay, without a religious
   novel in it--and these religious novels are a disgrace to the
   Christianity of the 19th Century! People's minds must be in an odd
   state when they can eat nothing but these whipped-creams and
   syllabubs--for people who would be healthy, should sit down to
   something solid, and their stimulants should be consistent with
   sobriety. You will never attain the mental growth of men and women by
   feeding on such stuff as that! You may make lackadaisical people in the
   shape of men and women, but the thinking soul with something in it, the
   woman who would serve her God as a true helper to the Christian
   ministry, the young man who would proclaim Christ and win souls need
   some better nutriment than the poor stuff that modern literature deals
   out so plentifully. Oh, my dear Friends, read the Bible in preference
   to all such books! They only deprave your taste. If you want these
   books, have them. We would not deny pigs their proper food and I would
   not deny any person living that which his taste goes after, provided it
   does not shock decent morals. I lament the taste rather than the
   indulgence of it! If you have a soul that canappreciate the pleasures
   of wisdom, eschew the trifles of folly. And if you have been taught to
   love verities, and substantial truths, you scarcely need that I should
   say, "Search the Scriptures." Search them diligently and frequently!

   Prefer the Scriptures to all religious books. In our books and our
   sermons--we will say it of all of them--we do our best to give you the
   Truth of God, but we are like the gold-beaters whose brazen arms you
   can see out over their doors-- we get a little bit of gold and we
   hammer it out. Some of my Brothers are mighty hands at the craft. They
   can hammer out a very small piece of gold so as to cover a whole acre
   of talk. But the best of us, those who would seek to bring out the
   Doctrines of Grace in love, are poor, poor things. Read the Bible for
   yourselves more, and confide less in your glossaries. I would rather
   see the whole stock of my sermons in a blaze, all burned to ashes, than
   that they should keep anybody from reading the Bible. If they may act
   as a finger pointing to certain chapters--"Read this! Read this!"--I am
   thankful to have printed them. But if they keep you away from your
   Bibles--burn them! Burn them! Do not let them lie on the top of the
   Scriptures--put them somewhere at the bottom, for that is their proper
   place. So with all sorts of religious books--they are a sort of
   mixture--their human thinking dilutes Divine Revelation. Keep to the
   Revelation of God, pure and simple.

   And, when you read your Bible, read it in earnest. There are several
   ways of reading the Bible. There is a skimming over the surface of
   it--content with the letter. There is also diving into it and praying
   yourselves down deep into the soul of it--that is the way to read the
   Bible! Do not always read it one verse at a time. How would Milton's
   Paradise Lost be understood if read by little snatches selected at
   random? You would never scan the purpose or design of the poem. Read
   one book through. Read John's Gospel. Do not read a bit of John and
   then a bit of Mark, but read John through, and get at John's drift.
   Remember that Matthew, though he wrote of the same Savior as Luke, is
   not more various in his style than he is distinct in his aim and, in a
   certain sense, independent of the testimony he bears. The four
   Evangelists are four separate witnesses, each giving a special
   contribution to the Doctrine as well as the history of Christ. Matthew,
   for instance, shows you Jesus as a King. You will notice that most of
   his parables begin with "a king." "Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
   likened." Mark shows you Christ as the Servant. Luke shows you Christ
   as Man, giving sketches of His childhood. And His parables begin with,
   "A certain man," while John teaches you Christ in His Godhead, with a
   starting point far different from the other three, which have been
   styled the Synoptical Gospels. "In the beginning was the Word, and the
   Word was with God, and the Word was God." Try, if you can, to get a
   hold of what the books mean, and pray God the Holy Spirit to lead you
   into the drift and aim of the sacred writers in so writing. I would
   like to see my Church members, all of them, good, hard, solid Bible
   students. Beloved, I would not be afraid of all the errors of Popery,
   Infidelity, Socinianism, Plymouth Brethrenism, or any other "ism" if
   you were to read your Bibles! You will thus keep clear of the whole
   lot. There is no doubt about your standing firm to the good old faith
   which we seek to teach you, if you do but keep to Scripture--the Book,
   the one Book, the Book of books, the Bible! That studied, not
   hurriedly, but with a determination to compare spiritual things with
   spiritual, and to observe the analogy of faith, you shall find a
   well-spring of delight and holy joy which men of letters who dabble in
   the proudest classics might envy, for Isaiah is better than Homer, and
   David is richer than Horace. But better still, you shall stand while
   others fall!

   IV. BUT ARE WE ALL BELIEVERS? IS THIS BOOK JOY TO ALL OF US?

   That is a significant pronoun in the text, "These things we write unto
   you that your joy may be full." To whom writes he? Is it to you? Young
   woman, does the Scripture write to you that your joy may be full? Young
   man, does the Scripture speak to you to fill you with holy joy? You do
   not know whether it does or not--you do not care about it. Then, it
   does not speak to you. You get plenty of joy elsewhere. Well, it does
   not speak to you. It does not intrude upon you. It leaves you alone. It
   offers you no joy. You have enough. "The whole have no need of a
   physician, but they that aresick."

   But there are some of you here who need a joy, and you have not found
   it. You are uneasy. You cannot find a tree to build your nest. You are
   like the needle, when it is turned away from its pole--you cannot be
   quiet. You have got a horseleech in you, that is always crying, "Give!
   Give!" You are uneasy. Oh, dear Friend, I am glad to hear it! May that
   uneasiness go on increasing. May you become weary of heart, and
   heavy-laden of spirit, for I have a whisper for you. Jesus Christ has
   come into the world to call to Himself all those who labor and are
   heavy-laden! And when you are sick and weary with the world, come to
   Him, come to Him! What? You have been turned out, have you? The world
   has got all it could out of you and thrust you away? Now, Jesus Christ
   will have you. Come to Him! Come to Him! He will receive you.

   So you are burnt out, are you? All the goodness that was in you is
   burned up and you have now become nothing but smoking flax--a stench in
   the estimation of your once flattering companions? You are nowhere.
   They do not like you. You are mopish and miserable. Oh come to Him!
   Come to Him, come to Him! He will not quench you. Your music is all
   over, is it? You were like a reed, like one of Pan's pipes. You could
   give out some music, once, but you got bruised and you cannot make one
   sound or note of joy. Well, poor Soul, come to Him! Come to Him! He
   will not break you. He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the
   smoking flax--

   "Wearysouls that wander wide

   From the central source of bliss,

   Turn to Jesus' wounded side

   Look to that dear blood of His." Here is peace, here is joy in Christ
   Jesus! Oh, if you are sick of the world, come to my Master! May God the
   Holy Spirit bless this sickness and make you come because you have
   nowhere else to go! Jesus Christ will receive the devil's castaways.
   The very sweepings of pleasure, the dregs of the intoxicating cup,
   those who have gone so far that now their friends reject them, Jesus
   Christ accepts! May He accept me, and accept you--and then in Him our
   joy shall be full! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM66:1-15.

   Verse 1. Make a joyful noise unto God, all you lands. Let not Israel
   alone do it. Take up the strain, you nations. He is the God of all the
   nations of the earth. "Make a joyful noise unto God, all you lands."

   2-4. Sing forth the honor of His name: make His praise glorious. Say
   unto God, How terrible are You in Your works! Through the greatness of
   Your power shall Your enemies submit themselves unto You. All the earth
   shall worship You and shall sing unto You. They shall sing to Your
   name. Selah. I still must always cling to the belief that this whole
   world is to be converted to God, and to lie captive at the feet of
   Christ in glorious liberty! Do not fall into that lethargic, apathetic
   belief of some that this is never to be accomplished--that the battle
   is not to be fought out on the present lines, but that there is to be a
   defeat--and then Christ is to come. No, foot to foot with the old enemy
   will He stand, till He has worsted him and until the nations of the
   earth shall worship and bow before Him!

   5, 6. Come and see the works of God: He is terrible in His doing toward
   the children of men. He turned the sea into dry land: they went through
   the flood on foot there did we rejoice in Him. Where God is most
   terrible to His enemies, He is most gracious to His friends! As Pharaoh
   and his hosts went down beneath the terrible hand of God, the children
   of Israel lifted up their loudest hallelujahs and sang unto the Lord,
   who triumphed gloriously! And so shall it be to the end of the chapter.
   God will lay bare His terrible arm against His adversaries but His
   children shall, meanwhile, make music! "There did we rejoice in Him."

   7-9. He rules by His power forever: His eyes behold the nations: let
   not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah O bless our God, you people,
   and make the voice of His praise to be heard. Who holds our soul in
   life and allows not our feet to be moved.Loudest among the singers
   should God's people be! If others can restrain their praise, yet let
   the love of Christ so compel us that we must give it a tongue and tell
   forth the majesty of our God! It is He alone who keeps us from Hell--
   which holds our soul in life! It is He alone who keeps us from falling
   foully. Yes, and falling finally, "and allows not our feet to be
   moved."

   10. For You, O God, have proved us. All God's people can say this. It
   is the heritage of the elect of God. "You have proved us."

   10-11. You have tried us, as silver is tried. You brought us into the
   net Entangled, surrounded, captive, held fast. Many of God's people are
   in this condition.

   11. You laid affliction upon our loins. It was no affliction of hand or
   foot, but it laid upon our loins--a heavy, crushing burden.

   12. You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire
   and through water It was the full ordeal. One was not enough. Fire
   destroys some, but water is the test for others--but God's people must
   be tried both ways. "We went through fire and through water, but"--.
   Blessed "but."

   12. But You brought us out into a wealthy place.Out of the fire and out
   of the water they came because God brought them! And when He brought
   them, it was not to a stinted, barren heritage, but into a wealthy
   place. Oh, Beloved, when we think of where the Covenant of Grace has
   placed every Believer, it is a wealthy place, indeed!

   13-15. I will go into Your house with burnt offerings: I will pay You
   my vows which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken when I was
   in trouble. I will offer unto You burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with
   the incense of rams. I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. The best,
   I think. "The best of the best will I bring You, O my God. I will bring
   You my heart. I will bring You my tongue. I will bring you my entire
   being

Peter's Prayer

   (No. 3407)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 21, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING JUNE 10,
   1869.

   "When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus'knees, saying, Depart
   from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." Luke 5:8.

   THE disciples had been fishing all night. They had now given up
   fishing--they had left their boats and were mending their nets. A
   Stranger appears. They had seen Him, probably, once before, and they
   remembered enough of Him to command respect. Besides, the tone of voice
   in which He spoke to them and His manner at once ruled their hearts. He
   borrowed Simon Peter's boat and preached a sermon to the listening
   crowds. After He had finished the discourse, as though He would not
   borrow their vessel without giving them their hire, He bade them launch
   out into the deep and let down their nets again. They did so and,
   instead of disappointment, they at once took so vast a haul of fish
   that the boats could not contain all and the net was not strong enough
   and began to break. Surprised at this strange miracle-- overawed,
   probably by the majestic appearance of that matchless One, who had
   worked it, Simon Peter thought himself quite unworthy to be in such
   company--and fell on his knees and cried this strange prayer--"Depart
   from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." So I desire that, first of
   all, we shall hear--

   I. THE PRAYER IN THE WORST SENSE WE CAN GIVE TO IT.

   It is always wrong to put the worst construction on anyone's words and,
   therefore, we do not intend to do so except by way of license and, for
   a few moments only, to see what might have been made out of these
   words. Christ did not understand Peter so. He put the best construction
   upon what he said, but if a caviler had been there, a wrong
   interpretation would have been to this sentence--"Depart from me, for I
   am a sinful man, O Lord."

   The ungodly virtually pray this prayer. When the Gospel comes to some
   men and disturbs their conscience, they say, "Go your way for this
   time. When I have a more convenient season, I will send for you." When
   some troublesome preacher tells them of their sins--when he puts a
   burning Truth of God into their conscience and awakens them so that
   they cannot sleep or rest--they are very angry with the preacher and
   the Truth that he was constrained to speak. And if they cannot bid him
   get out of their way, they can at least get out of his way, which comes
   to the same thing! And so the spirit of it is, "We do not want to give
   up our sin. We cannot afford to part with our prejudices, or with our
   darling lusts and, therefore, depart--get out of our way--leave us
   alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You
   come to torment us before our time?" Peter meant nothing of this sort,
   but there may be some here who do and whose avoidance of the Gospel,
   whose inattention to it, whose spite and hatred of it, all put together
   virtually make up this cry, "Depart from us, O Christ!"

   Alas, I fear there are some Christians who do, in fact--I will not say
   intentionally--really pray this prayer! For instance, if a believer in
   Christ shall expose himself to temptation--if he shall find pleasure
   where sin mingles with it, if he shall forsake the assemblies of the
   saints and find comfort in the synagogue of Satan--if his life shall be
   inconsistent, practically, and he also shall become inconsistent by
   reason of his neglect of holy duties, ordinances, private prayer, the
   reading of the Word and the like--what does such a Christian say but,
   "Depart from me, O Lord"? The Holy Spirit abides in our hearts and we
   enjoy His conscious Presence if we are obedient to His monitions. But
   if we walk contrary to Him, He will walk contrary to us and, before
   long we shall have to ask--

   "Where is the blessedness I knew When first Isaw the Lord?"

   Why does the Holy Spirit withdraw the sense of His Presence? Why, but
   because we ask Him to go! Our sins ask Him to go! Our unread Bibles do,
   as it were, with loud voices ask Him to be gone! We treat that sacred
   Guest as if we were weary of Him and He takes the hint and hides His
   face and then we sorrow and begin to seek Him again. Peter does not do
   so, but we do. Alas, how often ought we to say, "Oh, Holy Spirit,
   forgive us that we so vex You, that we resist Your admonitions, quench
   Your promptings and so grieve You! Return unto us and abide with us
   evermore."

   This prayer in its worst is sometimes practically offered by Christian
   Churches. I believe that any Christian Church that becomes divided in
   feeling, so that the members have no true love, one to another, that
   lack of unity is an act of horrible supplication! It does as much as
   say, "Depart from us, You Spirit of unity! You only dwell where there
   is love--we will not have love! We will break Your rest--get away from
   us!" The Holy Spirit delights to abide with a people that is obedient
   to His teaching, but there are churches that will not learn--they
   refuse to carry out the Master's will or to accept the Master's Word.
   They have some other standard, some human book--and in the excellencies
   of the human composition they forget the glories of the Divine! Now I
   believe that where any book, whatever it may be, is put above the
   Bible, or even set by the side of it, or where any creed or catechism,
   however excellent, is made to stand at all on an equal basis with that
   perfect Word of God, any church that does this, in fact says, "Depart
   from us, O Lord." And when it comes to actual doctrinal error,
   particularly to such grievous errors as we hear of, now-a-days--such as
   baptismal regeneration and the doctrines that are congruous thereto--it
   is, as it were, an awful imprecation and seems to say, "Begone from us,
   O Gospel! Begone from us, O Holy Spirit! Give us outward signs and
   symbols, and these will suffice us! But depart from us, O Lord--we are
   content without You." As for ourselves, we may practically pray this
   prayer as a Church. If our Prayer Meetings should be badly attended. If
   the prayers at them should be cold and dead. If the zeal of our members
   should die out. If there should be no concern for souls. If our
   children should grow up untrained in the fear of God. If the
   evangelization of this great city should be given over to some other
   band of workers and we should sit still. If we should become cold,
   ungenerous, listless, indifferent--what can we do worse for ourselves?
   How, with greater potency, can we put up the dreadful prayer, "Depart
   from us--we are unworthy of Your Presence! Begone, good Lord! Let
   'Icha-bod' be written on our walls! Let us be left with all the curses
   of Gerizim ringing in our ears."

   I say, then, the prayer may be understood in this worst sense. It was
   not so meant--our Lord did not so read it--we must not so read it
   concerning Peter. But let us, oh, let us take care that we do not offer
   it thus, practically, concerning ourselves!

   But now in the next place we shall strive to take the prayer as it came
   from Peter's lips and heart-- II. A PRAYER WE CAN EXCUSE AND ALMOST
   COMMEND.

   Why did Peter say, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord"?
   There are three reasons. First, because he was a man. Secondly, because
   he was a sinful man. And again, because he knew this and became a
   humble man.

   So, then, the first reason for this prayer was that Peter knew that he
   was a man and, therefore, being a man, he felt himself amazed in the
   Presence of such an One as Christ. The first sight of God--how amazing
   to any spirit even if it were pure! I suppose God never did reveal
   Himself completely--could never have revealed Himself completely to any
   creature, however lofty in its capacity. The Infinite must overwhelm
   the finite. Now, here was Peter, beholding, probably for the first time
   in his life in a spiritual way, the exceeding splendor and Glory of the
   Divine power of Christ! He looked at those fish and at once he
   remembered that night of weary toil, when not a fish rewarded his
   patience. And now he saw them in masses in the boat--and all done
   through this strange Man who sat there, having just preached a still
   stranger sermon, of which Peter felt that never man spoke like that
   before and he did not know how it was, but he felt abashed! He
   trembled, he was amazed in the Presence of such an One. I do not wonder
   if we read that Rebecca, when she saw Isaac, came down from her camel
   and covered her face with her veil. If we read that Abigail, when she
   came to meet David, alighted from her donkey and threw herself upon her
   face, saying, "My Lord, David!" If we find Mephibosheth depreciating
   himself in the presence of King David and calling himself a dog--I do
   not wonder that Peter, in the Presence of the perfect Christ, should
   shrink into nothing and, in his first amazement at his own nothingness
   and Christ's greatness, should say he scarcely knew what, like one
   dazed and dazzled by the light, half-distraught and scarcely able to
   gather together his thoughts and put them connectedly together! The
   very first impulse was as when the light of the sun strikes the eyes
   and it is a blaze that threatens to blind us! "Oh, Christ, I am a
   man--how can I bear the Presence of the God that rules the very fishes
   of the sea and works miracles like this?"

   His next reason was, I have said, because he was a sinful man and there
   is something of alarm mingled with his amazement. As a man he stood
   amazed at the shining of Christ's Godhead! As a sinful man, he stood
   alarmed at its dazzling holiness. I do not doubt that in the sermon
   which Christ delivered, there was such a clear denunciation of sin,
   such laying ofjustice to the line and righteousness to the
   plummet--such a declaration of the holiness of God--that Peter felt
   himself unveiled, discovered, his heart laid bare! And now came the
   finishing stroke. The One who had done this could also rule the fishes
   of the sea! He must, therefore, be God! And it was to God that all the
   defects and evils of Peter's heart had been revealed and thoroughly
   known! And almost fearing with a kind of inarticulate cry of alarm
   because the criminal was in the Presence of the Judge--the polluted in
   the Presence of the Immaculate--he said, "Depart from me, for I am a
   sinful man, O Lord."

   But I have added that there was a third reason, namely, that Peter was
   a humble man, as is clear from the saying, because he knew himself and
   confessed bravely that he was a sinful man. You know that sometimes
   there have been persons in the world who have suddenly found some king
   or prince come to their little cottage--and the good housewife, when
   the king, himself, was coming to her, has felt as if the place itself
   was so unfit for him that, though she would do her best for his
   majesty, and was glad in her soul that he would honor her hovel with
   his presence, yet she could not help saying, "Oh, that Your Majesty had
   gone to a worthier house, had gone on to the great man's house a little
   ahead, for I am not worthy that Your Majesty should come here." So
   Peter felt as if Christ lowered Himself, in coming to him, as if it
   were too good a thing for Christ--too great, too kind, too
   condescending a thing--and he seems to say, "Go up higher, Master! Sit
   not down so low as this in my poor boat in the midst of these poor dumb
   fishes. Sit not down here, for You have a right to sit on the Throne of
   Heaven in the midst of angels that shall sing Your praises day and
   night! Lord, do not stop here--go up, take a better seat, a higher
   place--sit among more noble beings who are more worthy to be blessed
   with the smiles of Your Majesty."

   Don't you think he meant that? If so, we may not only excuse his
   prayer, but even commend it, for we have felt the same. "Oh," we have
   said, "does Jesus dwell with a few poor men and women that have come
   together in His name to pray? Oh, surely, it is not a good enough place
   for Him--let Him have the whole world and all the sons of men to sing
   His praises! Let Him have Heaven, even the Heaven of heavens! Let the
   cherubim and seraphim be His servants and archangels loose the laces of
   His shoes! Let Him rise to the highest Throne in Glory and there let
   Him sit down, no more to wear the crown of thorns, no more to be
   wounded and despised and rejected, but to be worshipped and adored
   forever and ever." I think we have felt so and, if so, we can
   understand what Peter felt, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O

   Lord."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, there are times when these feelings, if they
   cannot be commended in ourselves, are yet excused by our Master and
   have a little in them, at any rate, which He looks upon with
   satisfaction. Shall I mention one?

   Sometimes a man is called to an eminent position of usefulness and, as
   the vista opens before him and he sees what he will have to do--and
   with what honor his Master will be pleased to load him--it is very
   natural and I think it is almost spiritualfor him to shrink and say,
   "Who am I that I should be called to such a work as this? My Master, I
   am willing to serve You, but oh, I am not worthy." Like Moses, who was
   glad enough to be the Lord's servant and yet he said, and he meant it
   so heartily, "Lord, I am slow of speech. I am a man of unclean lips,
   how can I speak for You?" Or, like Isaiah, who was rejoiced to say,
   "Here am I, send me!" But who felt, "Woe is me, for I am a man of
   uncircumcised lips! How shall I go?" Not like Jonah, who would not go
   at all, but must go off to Tarshish to escape working at Nineveh! Yet
   perhaps with a little seasoning of Jonah's bitters, too, but mainly a
   sense of our own unworthiness to be used in so great a service, we seem
   to say, "Lord, do not ask me to do that! After all, I may slip and
   dishonor You. I would serve You, but lest by any means I should give
   way under the strain, excuse Your servant and give him a humbler post
   of service." Now, I say we must not pray in that fashion, but still,
   while there is some evil there, there is a sediment of good which
   Christ will perceive in the fact that we see our own weakness and our
   own unsuitableness. He won't be angry with us, but separating the chaff
   from the wheat, He will accept what was good in the prayer and forgive
   the bad.

   Sometimes, again, dear Friends, this prayer has been almost on our lips
   in times of intense enjoyment Some of you know what I mean, when the
   Lord draws near unto His servants and is like the consuming fire--and
   we are like the bush that seemed to be altogether on a blaze with the
   excessive splendor of God realized in our souls! Many of God's saints
   have, at such times, fainted. You remember Mr. Flavel tells us that
   riding on horseback on a long journey to a place where he was to
   preach, he had such a sense of the sweetness of Christ and the Glory of
   God, that he did not know where he was--and he sat on his horse for two
   hours, together--the horse wisely standing still! And when he came to
   himself he found that he had been bleeding freely through the excess of
   joy. And as he washed his face in the brook by the roadside he said he
   felt, then, that he knew what it was to sit on the doorstep of Heaven
   and he could hardly tell that if he had entered the pearly gates, he
   would have been more happy, for the joy was excessive. To quote what I
   have often quoted before, the words of Mr. Welsh, a famous Scotch
   Divine who was under one of those blessed deliriums of heavenly light
   and rapturous fellowship, exclaimed, "Hold, Lord! Hold! It is enough!
   Remember, I am but an earthen vessel, and if You give me more, I die!"
   God does sometimes put His new wine into our poor old bottles and then
   we are half inclined to say, "Depart, Lord! We are not yet ready for
   Your glorious Presence." It does not come to saying that--it does not
   amount to all that in words--but still, the spirit is willing and the
   flesh is weak, and the flesh seems to start back from the Glory which
   it cannot bear as yet. There are many things which Christ could tell
   us, but which He will not because we cannot bear them now.

   Another time, when this has passed over the mind, not altogether
   rightly, not altogether sinfully, like the last two, is when the sinner
   is coming to Christand has, indeed, in a measure believed in Him, but
   when, at last, that sinner perceives the greatness of the Divine Mercy,
   the richness of the heavenly pardon, the glory of the inheritance which
   is given to pardoned sinners1 Then many a soul has started back and
   said, "It is too good to be true, or, if true, it is not true to me."
   Well do I remember a staggering fit I had over that business! I had
   believed in my Master and rested in Him for some months--and rejoiced
   in Him--but one day, while reveling in the delights of being saved and
   rejoicing in the Doctrines of Election, Final Perseverance and Eternal
   Glory--it came across my mind, "And all this for you, for such a dead
   dog as you--how can it be so?" And for awhile it was a temptation
   stronger than I could overcome! It was just saying, spiritually,
   "Depart from me, I am too sinful a man to have You in my boat--too
   unworthy to have such priceless blessings as You bring to me!"

   Now, that, I say, is not altogether wrong and not altogether right.
   There is a mixture there, and we may excuse and somewhat commend, but
   not altogether. There are other times in which the same feeling may
   come across the mind, but I cannot stay now to specify them. It may be
   so with some here, and I pray them not to concern themselves utterly,
   nor yet to excuse themselves completely, but to go on to the next
   teaching of this prayer--

   III. A PRAYER THAT NEEDS AMENDING AND REVISING.

   As it stood, it was not a good one. Now let us put it in a different
   way. "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." Would it not be
   better to say, "Come nearer to me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord"? It
   would be a more brave prayer and a more tender prayer--more wise and
   not less humble, for humility takes many shapes. "I am a sinful man,"
   here is humility. "Come nearer to me." Here is faith which prevents
   humility from degenerating into unbelief and despair! Brothers and
   Sisters, that would be a good argument, for see--"Since, Lord, I am a
   sinner, I need purifying. Only Your Presence can truly purify, for You
   are the Refiner and You purify the sons of Levi. Only Your Presence can
   cleanse, for the fan is in Your hand and You alone can purge Your
   floor. You are like a refiner's fire, or like fuller's soap--come
   nearer to me, then, Lord, for I am a sinful man and would not be always
   sinful. Come, wash me from my iniquity that I may be clean. And let
   Your sanctifying fire go through and through my nature till You burn
   out of me everything that is contrary to Your mind and will." Dare you
   pray that prayer? It is not natural to pray it. If you can, I would say
   to you, "Simon Bar-Jona, blessed are you, for flesh and blood have not
   taught you this." Flesh and blood may make you say, "Depart from
   me"--it is the Holy Spirit, alone, that under a sense of sin, can yet
   put a Divine attraction to you in the purifying fire and make you long,
   therefore, that Christ would come near to you!

   Again, "Come near to me, Lord, since I am a man and, being a man, am
   weak--and nothing can make me strong but Your Presence. I am a man so
   weak that if You depart from me, I faint, I fall, I pine, I die! Come
   near to me, then, O Lord, that by Your strength I may be encouraged and
   be fitted for service. If You depart from me, I can render You no
   service whatever. Can the dead praise You? Can those with no life in
   them give You glory? Come near me, then, my God, though I am so feeble!
   And as a tender parent feeds his child, and the shepherd carries his
   lambs, so come near to me."

   Do you not think he might have said, "Come near to me, Lord, and abide
   with me, for I am a sinful man," in the recollection of how he had
   failed when Christ was not near? All through that night he had put the
   net into the sea with many a splash--and had drawn it up with many an
   eager look as he gazed through the moonlight--and there was nothing
   that rewarded his toil. In went the net again--and now when Christ came
   and the net was full to bursting--would it not have been a proper
   prayer, "Lord, come near to me and let every time I work, I may
   succeed! And if I am made a fisher of men, keep nearer to me, still,
   that every time I preach Your Word, I may bring souls into Your net and
   into Your Church that they may be saved"?

   What I want to draw out from the text, and I shall do so better if I
   continue bringing out these different thoughts-- is this--that it is
   well when a sense of our unworthiness leads us not to get away from God
   in an unbelieving, petulant despair, but to get nearer to God! Now,
   suppose I am a great sinner. Well, let me seek to get nearer to God for
   that very reason, for there is great salvation provided for great
   sinners! I am very weak and unfit for the great service which He has
   imposed upon me--let me not, therefore, shun the service or shun my
   God, but reckon that the weaker I am, the more room there is for God to
   get the glory! If I were strong, then God would not use me, because
   then my strength would get the praise for it. But my very unfitness and
   lack of ability and all that I lament in myself in my Master's work is
   but so much elbowroom for Omnipotence to come and work in! Would it not
   be a fine thing if we could all say, "I glory not in my talents, not in
   my learning, not in my strength, but I glory in infirmity because the
   power of God does rest upon me"! Men cannot say, "That is a learned
   man--and he wins souls because he is learned." They cannot say, "That
   is a man whose faculties of reasoning are very strong and whose powers
   of argument are clear--and he wins sinners by convincing their
   judgments." No, they say, "What is the reason of his success? We cannot
   discover it. We see nothing in him different from other men, or
   perhaps, only the difference that he has less of gifts than they." Then
   glory be to God! He has the praise more clearly and more
   distinctly--and His head who deserves it--wears the crown!

   See, then, what I am aiming at with you, dear Brothers and Sisters. It
   is this-- do not run away from your Master's work, any of you, because
   you feel unfit--but for that reason do twice as much! Do not give up
   praying because you feel you cannot pray, but pray twice as much, for
   you need more prayer and, instead of being less with God, be more! Do
   not let a sense of unworthiness drive you away. A child should not run
   away from its mother at night because it needs washing. Your children
   do not stay away from you because they are hungry, nor because they
   have torn their clothes--they come to you because of their necessities!
   They come because they are children, but they come more often because
   they are needy children--because they are sorrowful children! So let
   every need, let every pain, let every weakness, let every sorrow, let
   every sin drive you to God. Do not say, "Depart from me." It is a
   natural thing that you should say so and not a thing altogether to be
   condemned, but it is a glorious thing, it is a God-honoring thing, it
   is a wise thing to say, on the contrary, "Come to me, Lord. Come still
   nearer to me, for I am a sinful man and without Your Presence I am
   utterly undone."

   I shall say no more, but I would that the Holy Spirit would say this to
   some who are in this house, who have long been invited to come and put
   their trust in Jesus, but always plead as a reason for not coming that
   they are too guilty, or that they are too hardened, or too something or
   other! Strange that what one man makes a reason for coming, another
   makes a reason for staying away! David prayed in the Psalms, "Lord have
   mercy and pardon my iniquity, for it is great." "Strange argument," you
   will say. It is a grand one! "Lord, here is great sin and there is now
   something that is worthy of a great God to deal with! Here is a
   mountain sin, Lord, have Omnipotent Grace to remove it! Lord, here is a
   towering Alp of sin--let the floods of Your Grace, like Noah's flood,
   come 20 cubits over the top of it! I am the chief of sinners-- here is
   room for the chief of Saviors." How strange it is that some men should
   make this a reason for staying away! This cruel sin of unbelief is
   cruel to yourselves--you have put away the comfort you might enjoy. It
   is cruel to Christ, for there is no pang that ever wounded Him more
   than that unkind, ungenerous thought that He is unwilling. Believe,
   believe that He never is so glad as when He is clasping His Ephraim to
   His breast! As when He is saying, "Your sins, which are many, are all
   forgiven you." Trust Him! If you could see Him, you could not help it.
   If you could look into that dear face and into those dear eyes, once
   red with weeping over sinners that rejected Him, you would say,
   "Behold, we come to You! You have the words of eternal life! Accept us,
   for we rest in You alone. All our trust on You is stayed." And that
   done, you would find that His coming to you would be like rain on the
   mown grass, as the showers that water the earth and, through Him, your
   souls would flourish, your sackcloth would be taken away and you would
   be girt about with gladness and rejoice in Him, world without end! The
   Lord Himself bring you to this. Amen.

   LUKE 15:1-27.

   We shall, tonight, read a chapter which, I suppose, the most of us know
   by heart. But as often as I have read it, I do not remember ever
   reading it without seeing some fresh light in it. May it be so tonight!

   Verse 1. Then drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners to hear
   Him. A rare crowd they must have been, when it is said all the
   publicans and sinners! All sorts of sinners came in such numbers that
   it seemed as if the city had sent out all its hosts of sinners. And
   these drew near--came as close as they could for fear of losing a
   single word! They made the inner ring about the Savior. He had a
   bodyguard of sinners and certainly there are none that will ever
   glorify Him as these people will do.

   2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This Man receives
   sinners and eats with them. They stood further off. Not to listen, but
   to murmur. Here was the old fable of the dog in the manger. They did
   not want Christ, themselves, but they murmured that other people should
   have Him. They despise Him. They thought themselves too righteous to
   need a Savior. Yet they murmured when the Physician came to His
   patients to give them the healing medicine!

   3. And He spoke this parable unto them, saying. They were hardly worth
   His trouble. But though He spoke it to them, others who are not of that
   sort have sucked sweetness out of it ever since! We are told this is a
   parable, but on looking at it we find it to be three. Have you ever
   seen a picture in three panels and the whole of the panels necessary to
   complete the picture? So it is here. Different views of the great work
   of Divine Grace suiting different persons, so that if we do not see
   through one glass, we may use a second, and a third!

   4. 7. What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
   does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that
   which is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it
   on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together
   his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I
   have found my sheep which was lost Isay unto you, that likewise joy
   shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety
   and nine just persons who need no repentance. Not that one repenting
   sinner is of more esteem in Heaven than 99 saints who have been kept by
   the power of God. No, not so, but there is a greater stir of joy in
   Heaven at the time of the sinner's repentance than there is over all
   the ninety-nine. And you know how that is. You may have many children
   and you may love them all alike, yet if one is ill you take far more
   notice of him just then--and all the house is ordered with a view to
   that sick child. He may not be the best child you have, but still, for
   the time being, there is more thought of him because he is ill. And if
   you should happen to have in your family a boy that has greatly grieved
   you and has gone astray, I am sure that if he were to repent, you would
   feel intense joy over him. But it would not be true that you thought
   more of him than of his brothers and of his sisters who are with you
   and are obedient to you. We must not learn from a passage more than it
   teaches. At the same time, let us learn as much as we can from it. It
   sets Heaven on a blaze ofjoy when one single penitent turns to his
   Father!

   8. Either what woman having tenpieces of silver, if she loses onepiece,
   does not light a candle andsweep the house, and seek diligently till
   she finds it?Eastern houses generally are very dark and if you need to
   find anything, you must light a candle. Now, this is one piece of money
   out of ten, as the sheep was one out of a hundred. The woman does not
   stand counting over the other nine, but she leaves them in the box and
   lights a candle and begins to make a stir. No doubt other people who
   were in the house would say, "What an inconvenience this dust is." She
   must find her piece of money. So sometimes in a congregation, we feel
   it necessary to have special services and makes a little stir--and
   there are some good souls who are inconvenienced and they do not like
   all the dust. Oh, it matters not what dust we make, as long as we find
   the lost piece--and if a soul is found, we can put up with some
   irregularities as long as the precious thing is discovered and brought
   to its Owner!

   9, 10. And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her
   neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece
   which I had lost. Likewise, Isay unto you, there isjoy in the presence
   of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.Here follows this
   most wonderful of all parables--the truest picture of man's folly and
   lost estate that was ever sketched--and at the same time the most
   wonderful picture of the Mercy and Love of God that was ever painted!

   11, 12. And He said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger of
   them said to His father, Father, give me the portion of goods that fall
   to me. And he divided unto them his living. In the East the younger son
   has a smaller portionof the estate compared with the elder. But it is a
   usual thing--certainly not an unusual thing--to let him have his
   portion while his father is yet alive, that he may make use of it and
   be able, by his industry, to increase it till he becomes a substantial
   person--a custom not altogether without wisdom in it if there must be a
   distinction between elder and younger sons. You remember how Abraham
   gave portions to his sons by Keturah and sent them away, whereas Isaac
   had nothing because he was the heir and had everything. So this younger
   son asks for his portion and the father divided to them his living.

   13. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and
   took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance
   with riotous living. His heart was distant from his father. Therefore
   he did not feel at ease until he put himself at a distance where he
   could do just as he liked--could do that which he knew his father would
   not approve of and what he would not like to do in his father's house.
   And is not this a true picture of the man who is not a friend of God?
   He wants to do as he likes. He desires to be independent and as he
   knows that what he likes to do will not please God, he tries to forget
   God. He gets into a far country by his forgetfulness. He says in his
   heart. "No God." He wishes there was no God. He gets as far away from
   God as he can. Then it is that he wastes his substance. Did you ever
   look at an ungodly life as the wasting of precious substance? It is
   just that! The love which ought to go to God is wasted in lust. The
   energy that ought to be spent in righteousness is wasted upon sin. The
   thought, the ability that ought to be laid at Jesus' feet is all used
   for selfish pleasure--and so it is wasted. He wasted his substance in
   riotous living.

   14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land
   and he began to be in need. "Began to be in need." What a change! At
   home with his father, then with plenty to waste--and now in need. Those
   two words, "in need," describe the condition of every ungodly man!
   After a time, he is in need--in need of everything that is good and
   worth having. His soul is a pauper. He is in need.

   15. And he sent and joined himself to a citizen of that country. A
   gentleman with whom he had spent a fortune. Many a time had this
   citizen sat at his table and drank his best wines. And what does this
   fine fellow do for him?

   15. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine.A very low occupation
   anywhere, but in Judea a peculiarly degrading occupation. He sent him,
   a Jew, into the fields to feed swine!

   16. And he would gladly have filled his belly with the husks that the
   swine did eat It does not say that he would have stopped his hunger
   with the husks, for that could not be done. He would only fill his
   belly--fill it up, as it were, with anything just to choke his sense of
   need. And there are many men that know that the world cannot satisfy
   them, but it could at least take their thoughts off a little from their
   inward need and so they gladly fill up their belly with the husks that
   the swine do eat.

   16. And no man gave unto him.He gave to them--he spent all his money
   with them. He was a fine fellow, then, so they said. But now no man
   gave to him. And what a mercy it was, for if they had given him all he
   needed, he would not have gone back to his father! There is nothing
   like a little gracious starvation to fetch a man home to Christ. And it
   is a blessed Providence and a blessed work of the Spirit of God when a
   man at last is starved till he must go home to God!

   17-20. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
   my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I
   will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
   sinned against Heaven, and before you, and am no more worthy to be
   called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants. And he arose
   and went to his father. "And when he came to himself." He had been
   beside himself before. There are two things upon which ungodly men are
   very ignorant--God and themselves. "He arose and went to his father."
   That was the best of all. He stopped not with resolutions, but he
   actually did the deed! This was the turning point with him. He arose
   and went to his father.

   20, 21. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had
   compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son
   said unto him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in your sight,
   and am no more worthy to be called your son. But the father interrupted
   the prayer. He would not let him conclude it. "Before they call, I will
   answer, and while they are yet speaking I will hear."

   22-24. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe
   and put it on him; and a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And
   bring the fatted calf, and kill it and let us eat and be merry, For
   this, my son was dead, and is alive again, he was lost, and is found.
   And they began to be merry.What a change between being in need and,
   "let us eat and be merry."--

   "Wonders of Grace to God belong."

   There is no wishing to fill his belly with husks, now! But the word is
   passed round, "Let us eat and be merry."

   25. Now his elder son was in the field. There is a great deal of
   questioning about who this man was--this eldest son. Why, dear me, I
   have known him! I have the misfortune to meet him every now and then.
   He is a very capital man--one of the best of men, but he does not care
   about revivals, or about having a great many converted. He is very
   suspicious about such things--he does not care about making so much
   fuss over men that have newly repented. He holds rather hard views
   about them. "He was in the field at work."

   25-27. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heardmusic and
   dancing. Andhe called one ofthe servants, and asked what these things
   meant. And he said unto him, Your brother is come; and your father has
   killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound. Did
   you ever notice that point--the father's gladness because he had
   received him safe and sound? No bones broken. His face was not
   disfigured. He was safe and sound. It is a wonderful thing that the
   sinner should come back to Christ safe and sound, considering where he
   has been! He has been in much worse danger than if he had been in
   battle or in shipwreck. He has been with drunks and with harlots--and
   yet he is received safe and sound. Oh, the wonders that Divine Grace
   can do, to put safeness and soundness into us who went so far astray!

Not Boasting, But Trusting

   (No. 3408)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 28, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Not of works lest any man should boast" Ephesians 2:9.

   THIS is very plain. There is no mistaking the sense. We are saved by
   Grace and not by our own doings. A reason is assigned. If we were saved
   by our own doings, it would be natural and certain that we would boast.
   It is well that the Apostle is so very explicit here and elsewhere upon
   this Doctrine, for men will fall against and blunt the edge of his
   statement. Self-righteousness is the natural religion of every degraded
   heart. Only the Spirit of God can make a man really receive and
   acknowledge the Truth of God. The Apostle seems determined that if any
   reject it, it shall not be for lack of clearness in his statement as a
   teacher. He does not beat about the bush, or go round about, or mince
   matters--he comes at once to the point, "By Grace are you saved"--and
   then he gives the negative, the backstroke of the sword, "Not of works,
   lest any man should boast." This is the old controversy of Christianity
   from the very beginning. The first heavy fire of the Gospel ordinance
   was directed against the Judaizers. They said salvation was by
   ceremonies and the works of the Law of God. In all sorts of shapes and
   ways, sometimes straightforwardly and sometimes cunningly, they tried
   to get into the Christian Church the idea that the works of men could
   have some merit in them and contribute in some degree to their
   salvation! The Apostle was a very sturdy opponent of this subtle
   innovation. His Epistle to the Romans, his Epistle to the Galatians,
   his Epistle to the Ephesians and, indeed, all his writings seem like so
   many cannons dragged to the front and discharging red-hot shot against
   the very idea of salvation by the works of the Law. "By the works of
   the Law there shall no flesh living be justified," he says, "for by the
   Law is the knowledge of sin."

   Further down in the history of the Christian Church this old conflict
   was renewed very vehemently by Martin Luther and his brother Reformers
   against the Church of Rome. You must not think that the great point of
   difference between the Protestants and Romanists is whether we shall
   obey that respectable old gentleman at Rome or not! Or whether we shall
   have our ministers dressed in blue and scarlet and fine linen--or in
   common broadcloth, like ourselves. Those trifles may become important
   as ostensible signs of profession, but they are not the main point at
   issue. They are merely the husk of the controversy! The real battle
   between the Papists and the Protestants turns on this--are men saved by
   works, or are they saved by Grace? All the Reformers that ever tried to
   reform the Church of Rome by interfering with her mummeries and her
   monasteries, her priests and their vestments, her holy days and
   celebrations, and I do not know what besides, were all just fiddling
   away with a wasted force at some of the external branches of that
   horrible old upas tree! But when Luther came fresh from the cell with
   that Light of God still beaming from his eyes, "We are justified by
   faith," then it was that the axe was laid at the root of this tree!
   There is nothing needed to bring down popery but the constant
   promulgation of this one Truth of God--"It is not of him that wills,
   nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy," for salvation is
   not of man, neither by man--it is of the Lord and it is given to as
   many as believe on the Lord Jesus Christ with all their hearts! In
   fact, this is the standing controversy, today, before which all other
   controversies dwindle into insignificance. The outside world still has
   it that they will be saved by their own doings. The host of God's
   elect, stripped of their own righteousness and made to put on the
   righteousness of Christ, stand, each man, with his sword upon his side
   and his shield in his hand, defensive for this one Truth of God, this
   vital Truth of God, the all-important Truth of the Gospel!

   For this, Brothers and Sisters, we ought, every one of us, to be
   prepared to shed our blood! To obliterate or to disguise this Truth
   were to put out the lamp that illuminates this dark world! Take away
   the only ointment that can healearth's wounds! To destroy the only
   medicine that will ever cure the diseases of humanity--"Justified by
   faith, saved by Grace, not of works, lest any man should boast."

   At this time, let us briefly consider a great negative--"not of works."
   A great reason--"lest any man should boast." And then throw in, one
   after the other, with very little order, a few thoughts about this
   great matter.

   A GREAT NEGATIVE--"Not of works." Now, Brothers and Sisters, it must
   not be of works because that way has been tried and has proved a
   complete failure. Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden under
   circumstances peculiarly conducive to his happiness. The Law of God
   which was to test him was remarkably simple. It contained but one
   command, "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not
   eat." Adam was not, as we are, corrupt--his constitution had no
   tendency to sin. He was pure and perfect with well balanced judgment
   and without bias one way or the other. He had never sinned--he need not
   ever to have sinned! It seems to me, he had nothing to gain by sin. His
   paradise was as perfect as it could be! God had been pleased to give
   him everything necessary to make him abundantly happy. But under these
   circumstances--the most favorable in which humanity was ever
   placed--the way of acceptance before God by works broke lamentably
   down!

   Whether after a short or long term of probation, we will not say--it is
   folly to speak where Scripture is silent--it is certain that when
   tempted, he lapsed, for the woman took the fruit and the man also
   partook of it. Then acceptance by works became like a potter's vessel
   smashed with a rod of iron! Man had tried the way of merit and bitter,
   indeed was the award. Despair, you sons of Adam--where your father
   failed, though up to then untainted--you, with perverted will, with
   imagination apt to picture pleasantry in sin, with judgment warped and
   strained by innate depravity, by the infection of example and by the
   force of surrounding circumstances--think not that you can stand
   upright where perfect Adam fell! Hope not to find a way back through
   the gates of Paradise, for there still stands the cherub with his
   flaming sword--and no flesh living shall henceforth be saved by his
   works! The way of salvation by works is utterly unsuitable for us! It
   is not only fruitless, proved to be so, but it is inconsistent.
   Anything which involves an impossibility is vain to propose. Propose to
   a man without feet that he should walk, or to a man without eyes that
   he should distinguish colors--you see the folly--but is it not equally
   absurd to recommend a convict to seek a peerage? It is impossible for
   any one of us to obtain merits before God!

   We have all confessedly sinned already. Our present status debars us
   from entering the list for future honors. By what means are we to put
   away this old sin? There it stands. Suppose we obey God from this time
   forth till we die without a single fault--we shall then only have done
   what it was our duty to perform and God had a right to expect of us!
   There will be no balance left, nothing to put per contra against our
   sins, nothing to our credit as a reduction of our liabili-ties--we
   would only have paid the current account, supposing that to be
   possible. The debt will still remain! The old score--who is to pay
   that? "Oh," says one, "we apply to Christ for that." No, no, Sir! If it
   is to be by works, you must keep to works, for the Apostle lays it down
   in the 11th of Romans that, "if it is of Grace, it is not of works, and
   if it is of works it is not of Grace." Two principles, these, which
   will not mingle--have which you like. They are like oil and water, or,
   rather, like fire and water--they are opposed to each other! If Christ
   is to save you, He must do it altogether. He will never be a
   make-weight for you, depend upon it! He did not come into this world to
   make up a few deficiencies--not at all so! He will not have you
   boasting! He will not have you sharing the honor of your salvation with
   Him!

   God demands of every man a perfect life--having all sinned, we cannot
   bring Him a perfect life. You have cracked that vase. And, if you do
   not break it again, it is already cracked. "Oh," but you tell me, "it
   is only in a little place." Yes, but if there is only one link in the
   chain broken which drags up the miner from the deeps of the earth, it
   is quite enough for his destruction that one link is broken! There is
   no need to have a dozen links fretted through with rust, the one flaw
   is sufficient. If you will be saved by works, you must be absolutely
   perfect, for it is inconsistent with the Justice of God that He should
   accept any but perfect obedience from the creatures that come under His
   sway. Can you render this?

   If you know yourselves, you will say, "we cannot." You will look on the
   flames that Moses saw when Sinai was on a blaze--you will tremble and
   despair of ever saving yourselves!

   But, again, while the way has been proven to be fruitless and is
   certainly unsuitable, it is a way which, with all his talking, no man
   ever does fairly try. I have often noticed that those who prate loudest
   of good works are those that have the fewest good deeds to make mention
   of. Like little traders in the streets with their little stock of
   commodities, they had need cry and advertise their wares because they
   have so little to sell! Whereas a diamond merchant or dealer in bullion
   sits still and never makes a noise at all because he has precious
   treasure by him. Your hard talkers about good works generally come from
   some disreputable haunt. They will even boast that their sentiments are
   better than their habits. Well, they need be! I have seen them put
   their black and smutty fingers upon the bright Gospel of Christ and
   say, "This leads to licentiousness." Pity, then, Sir, you should ever
   approach it, since you can find licentiousness fast enough without it!
   Pure minds see God in the Gospel. They veil their faces and bow before
   its majesty. Ah, well might I preach up morality, but not as the way of
   salvation, or what would be the result of it? What said Chalmers during
   the early part of his life? He said, "I preached up sobriety till
   nearly all my followers became great drinkers. I preached up honesty
   till I manufactured thieves. The more I preached of the right which man
   ought to do, the more I found men doing wrong." These are not his
   words, but they are the sense of his own solemn confession when he came
   to read the pure Gospel and began to preach it with all his heart!

   So is it with every man and I suppose it always will be. Dry essays
   about duty run off and slide like oil down a slab of marble--while the
   proclamation of the Gospel of the Grace of God in pardoning the chief
   of sinners attracts men to Jesus, breaks their hearts, causes them to
   hate sin, sets them upon reformation, makes them holy and helps them to
   persevere even to the end! "Not of works," says the text--and we come
   back to it. If salvation were by works and could be so worked
   out--listen--then Calvary would be a superfluity! The Cross of Christ,
   with all its wonders, would be a work of supererogation on God's part!
   The work of Redemption would be a subject of derision for us! Is there
   no salvation, or is there salvation somehow else? Must God come down
   and take the form of man and in that form must the Christ of God suffer
   even unto death--and all for nothing--for it comes to that! If man can
   save himself, what is there need of you angels? Hush your Christmas
   carols! What need for those gazing eyes and that absorbing wonder as
   you watch the manifestation of the Lord of Glory, Incarnate among men?
   What needs it that the Prophets talk of the Lamb of God and point us to
   the Infinite Sacrifice? What need is there that Jesus wears the crown
   of thorns and bows His head to die for us? There are men who say we can
   work our own passage to the stars and by our merits enshrine ourselves
   among the blessed. Sirs, which shall I believe--that God has worked a
   work that need not have been, or that you are under the spell of a
   fatal delusion? "Let God be true and every man a liar." You can find no
   way to Heaven but by the Cross!--

   "Could your zeal no respite know, Could your tears forever flow-- All
   for sin could not atone-- Christ must save, and Christ alone!"

   Those persons who prate most of salvation by works, whether they
   acknowledge it or not, do really lower the standard of holiness and
   abate the dignity of the Law of God. You come to probe them and the old
   story which Whitefield and John Vaudois fought against so valiantly of
   Saxon obedience is the petition of the self-righteous man's creed.
   "Well," he says, "I can't keep all the Law of God--I admit that. As to
   thoughts, deeds and words, I can't be quite clean, but I will do my
   best." Now, what is this but to altogether lower the Law of God because
   you cannot come up to God's Law? Is the Almighty God to come down to
   your terms? Do you think to barter with Him? Can your miserable three
   farthings in the pound satisfy a Divine Law? This will never be!
   "Heaven and earth shall pass away," says Christ, "but not one jot or
   one tittle of the Law shall fail." This is the Word of God spoken from
   Sinai, "Cursed is every man that continues not in all things that are
   written in the Book of the Law to do them."

   God will not take part payment! Holiness, let me tell you, Sirs, is a
   very different thing from that morality which some men boast of! Why, I
   almost hold my breath when I encounter some men's morality that they
   talk so much of! Those loose tongues that chatter so glibly against the
   Gospel as fomenting licentiousness--if they did but once cry, "God be
   merciful to us sinners," would come much nearer to playing their right
   part. Men that are sinning daily in open violation of common virtue
   will talk as though they were pure in all their tastes, holy in all
   their thoughts and above suspicion in all their lives? Oh, no! God's
   holiness is something more grand, more sublime than you and I have
   guessed at! And we shall not reach to that by our works, at any rate,
   for they are blotted, blurred, marred and spoiled upon the wheel like
   the figures of an ill-taught potter--and we cannot presume to exhibit
   them before the living God.

   II. A GREAT REASON IS GIVEN--a few words on it--"Not of works lest any
   man should boast." If any man could get to Heaven by his own works,
   what a boaster he would naturally be! I am sure he would be so on
   earth. This is the part he would play. He would hear that God, in His
   mercy, had been forgiving some great sinner and that there wasjoy in
   Heaven over him. And he would say, "I cannot take my share in such
   pleasures as that. I have never transgressed His Commandments. I find
   myself very tightly bound and I do not get much joy out of it. Here is
   that renegade who has been given to sin and he is to be saved! I do not
   like it." You know where to read the story in Luke's Gospel, "He was
   angry and would not go in, therefore his father came and entreated him.
   And he answering, said to his father, Lo, these many years have I
   served you, neither transgressed I at any time your commandments and
   yet you never gave me a kid that I might make merry with my friends.
   But as soon as this, your son was come, which has devoured your living
   with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf." Pretty specimen
   of a son, but the picture of what any man would be who felt, "I owe God
   nothing. I am all right--I am saved by my own works."

   What a churl he would be in the Church! I am sure I would be very sorry
   to admit such a man to our assemblies. I would feel that he was quite
   out of place with poor sinners saved by Grace like ourselves, who have
   nothing to boast of. It would make the whole Church wretched to have
   such people in Church fellowship! Why, if we did not idolize them, we
   would hate them! I do not know which of the two it would be--certainly
   they would be much out of place in our assemblies with their boasting.
   And what would they do in Heaven? Why, the very reverse of what all the
   spirits are doing who are there--these all sing, "We have washed our
   robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"--they would have to
   say, "We kept our raiment white ourselves." When the ransomed spirits
   cast their crowns at His feet, the self-righteous souls would hold high
   their crests and wear their tiaras, saying, "We have won them ourselves
   and we have a right to them!" It would spoil Heaven! Heaven would not
   be the perfection of harmony. Such beings would occasion discord in the
   Glory Land--a greater discord than seen in the universe since the Fall!
   No, no! It is "Not of works, lest any man should boast"!

   Do I hear somebody say, "We do not maintain that men are to be saved by
   works altogether, but partly by God's Grace and partly by their own
   works." Well, I will suppose for a moment that this strange monster can
   be manufac-tured--a saint compounded part of Grace and part of works!
   Well now, in what proportion are these two opposite qualities to be
   brought together? How much Grace and how much works? Half works? Yes.
   Then how about those poor fellows who come very near half? Well, one
   quarter works? Yes. And then three-quarters Grace? Well, perhaps some
   more, and some less. Some three-quarters works, some half works and
   some only one-eighth works and so on. You will have to arrange them
   very orderly, you know--and depend upon it that as soon as they find
   out the proportion of their salvation that was by works--in that
   proportion they will begin to boast! I would and I do not think I would
   be to blame if I did. I would say, "Now, here I am, saved half by my
   works. Here is a lot of these poor believers in Christ who were saved
   altogether by Grace, but I have contributed of my own means a full half
   to my salvation. I do not mind just lifting my crown a little--just
   admit I had help in getting it on my head, but I am not going to cast
   it down at His feet--every man has a right to what is his due!"

   I thought Napoleon did a good thing when, on the day of his coronation,
   he took his crown and put it on his own head. Why should he not take
   the symbol that was his due? And if you get to Heaven one half by Grace
   and one half by works, you will say, "Atonement profited me a little,
   but integrity profited me much more!" Do I seem to you to talk
   sarcastically? Be it admitted I do! Were it possible for me to kick
   this idea of human merit like a football round the world, Sirs--were it
   possible to set it in the pillory of scorn and pelt it with I know not
   what of filth, I would feel that I had the Apostle Paul standing by my
   side and saying, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
   Christ. Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." And I would hear
   him say of his own righteousness, "I count it as dung, that I may win
   Christ, and be found in Him." He could not have taken a coarser figure,
   nor one which expressed more thoroughly his hearty contempt of
   everything like self-righteousness--"I count it as dung that I may win
   Christ, and be found in Him." "Lest any man should boast"--this is a
   good and sufficient reason why salvation should not be of works! Now--

   III. A FEW THOUGHTS WITHOUT ORDER, but I hope they may catch your
   attention and stick in your memory. Some say--I know it is a common
   observation--this talking about sinners coming to Christ just as they
   are and trusting in Him alone for their salvation is very dangerous.
   Respectable persons and people who think themselves qualified to be
   critics, generally make some such observation as this--"it is very
   dangerous." Now my dear Friends, if you will condescend to listen for a
   minute, I would remind you that neither you nor I have anything to do
   with making the Gospel We may think the Gospel ought to be
   such-and-such, but that does not make it so. And if I should choose to
   think, or if youshould, that such-and-such a Doctrine is very
   dangerous, that neither makes it true nor makes it false, for, after
   all, the great solemn appeal about all matters of religion is not to
   you, nor yet to me! We stand on an equal footing there--you may think
   one thing and I may think another. But the Judge--the Judge that ends
   the strife where wit and reason fail, must decide. The great question
   is, "What say the Scriptures? What does the Old Book say?" If it does
   not teach that the salvation of a sinner is altogether by Grace and not
   of works, it does not teach anything at all--and there are no words in
   any language that mean anything! I must be made to believe that black
   is white and that God has purposely and willfully written a Book to
   deceive us, before I can believe salvation to be by works! For the
   expressions about this matter are not a few. They are not casual--they
   are not dark and mysterious, they are not metaphorical--they are plain,
   simple and obvious. I challenge any man--I will not say any
   theologian--but any man of common-sense that can read the
   Bi-ble--whether he uses our version, or prefers the original--if he
   will but read it honestly, he can come to no other conclusion in
   reading the Epistles of Paul than this--that salvation is by Grace
   through faith in the merits of Christ--and not at all by the works of
   the Law.

   Now, that is a thing that ought to decide and end the matter. I ask you
   not to heed anything I say--do not take my word for it--my ipse dixit
   is nothing! It is in God's Book and on your heads it must be if you
   deny it! "Oh," said one to another, "I didn't like your preaching the
   other night." "What didn't you like in it?" "I didn't like your
   preaching up salvation to sinners." "Oh, that is nothing to me, the
   quarrel is not between you and me, but between you and my Master. You
   must settle that with Him. I have nothing to do with manufacturing
   Doctrines--my business is to preach them as I find them in the
   Scripture. If you do not like them, you must leave them, but it is at
   your own peril." Let me say to all of you, I beseech you cast not away
   your own soul!

   Everyone of us ought to remember that a great deal of that commodity in
   this world known by the name of good works is not good works at all
   What is a good work? I would venture to say that anything that has in
   it the element of selfishness is not good. You may question that, but I
   think it is the highest virtue to be unselfish. If a man is found to be
   virtuous, as we say, with the design of benefiting himself, has he not
   spoiled his virtue? The very design of seeking merit by what he does,
   spoils the possibility of merit! A man is not a servant of God while he
   is only serving himself. It is only when he gets rid of self that he
   becomes truly good. To pray may be good or not, according to whether it
   is real prayer. To attend the House of God, or give alms to the poor
   may be good or not good, according to the heart. But external duties
   are not good works! No, though a man should be faultless in his
   external life, yet if the motive were sinister and the desires unclean,
   his works would all taste of the fountain from where they came and not
   be good in the sight of God. Did it ever strike you that in our works
   the heart must always be the great matter?

   Cowper, in his Task, has very wonderfully worked out this subject in
   the best blank verse. He pictures two footmen employed by you--one of
   them is a very polite, quick, nimble, handy fellow--but, as he says, he
   serves you for your house, your housemaid, and your pay. Let either of
   these be gone and he is gone, too. But the true servant is Charles,
   that stands behind the chair, that is troubled if your appetite seems
   to fail, that has been with you from a boy, that if you were poor and
   hadn't any pay to give him, would cling to the posts of your
   doors--that would live for you and die for you-- that is the man whom
   you love as a servant! So it is with virtue. The best and highest of
   good works are those that spring from love, real love to God! Now,
   where do you find this? In the man who rejects Christ? No--his works
   are those of a slavish fear! He does not serve God out of love, but
   because he trembles at the thought of Hell. But when a soul is brought
   to trust in Jesus, then the heart loves God, the service of God becomes
   a great delight and the man who says, "I am not saved by works," works
   ten times harder than he ever would have done if he had hoped to be
   saved by his own doings! And his works are better works because he has
   devoted love which infuses into them a sacred excellency which
   otherwise had not been there.

   Be it forever known and understood that when we preach salvation by
   Grace, we do not undervalue morality. No, Brothers and Sisters, we
   exalt it! I will give you proof. There is a hospital. It is free to all
   the sick, but there is a notion about town that nobody may enter there
   except those who do something to heal themselves. Now, I will suppose
   that I am sent as a missionary to go among the sick and tell them that
   their own health is not worth a farthing, that they are to come to the
   hospital gates just as they are, that at the hospital they look at
   disease as a qualification and not at health. Somebody might say, "Here
   is this man undervaluing health." My dear Brother, I am doing no such
   thing! Do you think I would be trying to get these sick people into the
   hospital if I undervalued health? It is not health I undervalue--it is
   the quackery that mimics health! It is this empiricism which films over
   men's diseases, which had need be dealt with otherwise. Why, if
   thousands in London were dying because they had the notion that they
   could not be received at the hospital unless they healed themselves,
   surely it were the kindest and best work a man could do--and the
   quickest means to promote the popular health--to go and dissuade men of
   this absurd notion! If, my Brothers and Sisters, when we bade you come
   to Christ, we told you that after coming to Him, you might live in sin
   as you did before, we would be worthy to be hanged! But when we tell
   you that Christ is a Physician and His Church a hospital--and that He
   can heal you if living in sin, we do not by any means decry your
   morality, but only tell you that it is but a piece of quackery until
   you come to Christ!--

   "Speak they of morals, oh, You bleeding Lamb! The best morality is love
   to You!"

   The best holiness is to love Christ and to serve Him actuated by the
   motive of gratitude! And if you try merit before you come to Him, it
   will only plunge you into deeper sin! You cannot blot out your
   iniquities. Still I know the scandal will be repeated, but if any
   choose to repeat it, the lives of those who have preached up salvation
   by Grace furnish the best answer. In the days of Charles the First and
   Charles the Second, you would have found the party headed by Laud in
   the Church of England crying up ritual, crying up good works. You would
   have found on the other hand, the Puritan party rigidly preaching up
   Justification by Faith and Salvation by Grace. Now, Sirs, where did you
   find the country parson that preached in the morning upon good works,
   in the afternoon? Why, with a girl on either side dancing round the
   Maypole, according to the Book of Sports! And if you needed him a
   little later in the evening, you would have to send some trusty parish
   beadle to bring him in from the village alehouse!

   But where is the man who preached salvation by Grace while at the
   conventicle? "Oh" says one, "he is at home singing Psalms with his
   family." Doesn't he go round the Maypole? "No, the old bigot, he never
   breaks the Sabbath. He says it is against the Law of God." Well, but
   isn't he in the alehouse? "No, I dare say the old superstitious
   creature is on his knees somewhere, praying." Everybody knows this was
   the fact! The Puritan theology bred Puritan living--the Doctrine of
   Justification by Faith made men holy! But the other party that preached
   this wonderful doctrine of salvation by works went pretty far to prove,
   at any rate, that theycould not be saved by their works! The
   long-haired cavaliers, with their scented locks and their abominations
   not fit to be uttered by pure tongue, or heard by the ear of
   decency--these were your work mongers, your upholders of salvation by
   your own doings! But the man that ordered his household well in the
   fear of God, the man that could bend to God but not to a tyrant, the
   man that loved his country and would sooner die on Edge Hill or Naseby
   than he would lay down the faith he held dear to him--that is the man
   who preached that we are justified by faith and not at all by the works
   of the Law! You shall find holiness grows out of the one Doctrine which
   is despised--and wickedness springs from the other which is advertised
   as a panacea for all ills!

   If there are any here that think they can be saved by their own works,
   I have no Gospel to preach to them whatever. I will not interfere with
   them. My Master has said that there is no need of a physician to them
   that are not sick. Good people, virtuous people, excellent people--you
   that are going to Heaven all on your own account--don't quarrel with us
   poor sinners because we choose to have what you despise! If you do not
   want the medicine, let us drink it and be not bitter against us if we
   choose another way than yours. If your road is broad enough and there
   are enough companions in it, let us alone if we choose the narrow path!

   But yet I cannot coolly dismiss you so. If you are naked, poor and
   miserable--I will not insult you. I counsel you by my Master--get gold
   tried in the fire that you may be rich and white raiment that you may
   be clothed--and if you know not how you can buy it, I will tell you. It
   is without money and without price! It is freely given and shall be
   given to you if you will take it. Shake your hand of that venomous
   serpent of your own self-confidence! Shake it into the fire, I pray
   you--it is the best place for it! You may come with empty hands to
   Christ and He will give you all your soul can want. When you come to
   die, you will find that good-works theory unable to bear you up. The
   best of men have looked upon their lives from that closing scene in
   another manner than they ever did before. One said he was gathering up
   all his works--his good works and his bad works, too--and flinging them
   all overboard that he might just simply trust in a Crucified Savior. At
   any rate, Friend, if you are prepared to risk your soul on your works,
   I am not prepared to risk mine on anything that I have done! No, I am
   not afraid to meet the trial hour. I am not afraid to look you in the
   face to-night and say, "I will meet you on that tremendous day and we
   will see whose confidence is the better. You shall take yourworks if
   you will, and I will take my Lord! And you shall rest in what you do,
   but I will not rest in anything I do." Oh, rest well upon Him and I
   will tell you what will happen when the whirlpools of Almighty Wrath
   shall be round about you! Your good works shall go like those deceitful
   life-buoys we heard of the other day--and you shall sink! But never did
   a soul sink that could cling to Christ! It is an unheard of thing that
   Christ has ever let a sinner perish, for He has said, "Him that comes
   to Me, I will in no wise cast out."

   Now, whether you have been righteous or wicked, whether you can cry
   yourselves up, or whether you bewail yourselves that you are deep in
   the mire of sin--go, stretch out your hand and take Christ! Turn your
   eyes to Jesus, dying upon Calvary's Cross and look to Him--

   "There is life in a look of the Crucified One!" There is life at this
   moment for you! I wish that everyone in this dense mass would look to
   my Master. There is Grace enough in Christ for everyone of you! No
   sinner was ever lost because there was any stint in Christ! No, but
   because they would not come and thought themselves too good for Him.
   Come as you are--just as you are and trust Christ. And then mark you,
   you will be saved! You will be saved from the love of sin! You will be
   saved from the power of it! You will begin a new and holy life. You
   will henceforth be full of good works which shall abound to the Glory
   of God--and with these good works upon you, you shall be like a tree
   that is covered with rich fruit, acceptable to God! Still your root
   shall not be your fruit, but your root shall be a simple faith in a
   precious Christ whom this night I have declared unto you. So God bless
   you. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS5:1-9.

   Verse 1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ We have it tonight. We enjoy it. We
   delight in it, "through our Lord Jesus Christ."

   2. By whom also we have access by faith into this Grace wherein we
   stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only have we peace,
   but we get into the favor of God and we stand in it! This is the Grace
   or favor which comes of being justified. We now feel a freedom to come
   into our Father's Presence because He has forgiven us for Christ's
   sake. We now feel at home with Him though once we were prodigal sons
   and had wandered far away. And we rejoice in hope of the Glory of God.
   We have something yet in reserve--present peace, but future perfection!
   We have present rest, but there still remains a rest for the people of
   God. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God!

   3-5. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations, also, knowing that
   tribulation works patience. And patience, experience, and experience,
   hope. And hope makes us not ashamed because the love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us. So that
   even what might seem to be the disadvantages of this present life are
   made to work into advantages! And what at one time might threaten our
   prosperity, really conduces to it. Patience, which we never could have
   if we never had a trouble, is given to us. And experience, which we
   never could have if we did not patiently endure the trouble we obtain!
   We get pearls out of these deep seas. We get treasures out of these
   blazing furnaces which seem to smelt our blessings, that they may come
   to us rich and pure. And, above all, there rises a glorious hope, never
   to be drowned--never to be made ashamed--because we feel the love of
   God shed abroad in our hearts like a sweet perfume making every part of
   our nature fragrant because the Holy Spirit is there!

   6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
   the ungodly. That was our character. There was no good point about us.
   We were ungodly and we had no strength to mend ourselves or to be other
   than ungodly. The strength for reformation had all gone. The strength
   for regeneration we never had. We were without strength and then Christ
   died for us--died for the ungodly!

   7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a
   good man. A benevolent, loving-spirited man.

   7, 8. Some would even dare to die. But God commends His love toward us
   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.And that is the
   glory of His Love! While we were rebels against His government, He
   redeemed us. While we were far off from Him by wicked works, He sent
   His Son to die and bring us near. Free Grace, indeed, was this--not
   caused by anything in us but springing freely from the great heart of
   God!

   9. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved
   from wrath through Him. You see the force of the argument? If He loved
   us when we were still dead in sin, much more will He keep us and
   preserve us now that He has justified us! Were His enemies redeemed?
   Shall not His friends be kept? Did He love those who were still far
   off? Will He not love those who are brought near--and love us even to
   the end?

Seeking Richly Rewarded

   (No. 3409)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 4, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   8, 1869.

   "The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they who seek the Lord
   shall not want any good thing." Psalm 34:10.

   THE young lions are very strong. They are as yet in the freshness of
   their youth and yet their strength does not always suffice to keep them
   supplied. The young lions are very crafty--they understand how to
   waylay their game and leap upon them with a sudden spring at unawares,
   and yet, with all their craftiness, they howl for hunger in the woods.
   The young lions are very bold and furious, very unscrupulous. They are
   not stayed from any deed of depredation and yet for all that,
   freebooters as they are, they sometimes lack and suffer hunger. These
   are just the type of many men in the world--they are strong men, they
   are cunning men, they are thoroughly up to the times--smart, sharp men.
   If anybody could be well supplied, one would think they should be. But
   how many of them go to bankruptcy and ruin and, with all their cunning,
   they are too cunning! And with all their unscrupulousness, they manage,
   at last, full often, to come to an ill end. They do lack and suffer
   hunger. But here are the people of God--they are regarded as
   simpletons, such simpletons as to seek the Lord instead of adopting the
   maxims of universal worldly wisdom, namely, "Seek yourself!" They have
   given up what is called the first law of human nature--namely,
   self-seeking, self-pleasing, self-serving--and have come to seek the
   Lord, to seek to magnify Him. And what comes of their simplicity? "They
   shall not want any good thing." Notwithstanding their lack of power,
   their want of cunning and the check which conscience often puts upon
   them, so that they cannot do what others can to enrich themselves--yet
   for all that, they have a fortune ensured to them! They "shall not want
   any good thing."

   Let us look at this text, now, and together consider it thus--first,
   the seeking of the Lord which is here intended. And then following upon
   that, the promise that is given upon such seeking.

   I. THE SEEKING OF THE LORD HERE INTENDED.

   We must be particular and very precise about this. The promise is so
   rich that we wish to win it fully, but we do not wish to be dishonest.
   We would not take a Word of God that does not belong to us, lest we
   should deceive ourselves and be guilty of robbing God. We must go
   carefully and jealously, here, and must search ourselves to see if in
   very deed and truth we are such as reallyseek the Lord.

   Now, the term to "seek the Lord," I may say, is the description of the
   life of the Christian. When he lives as he should, his whole life is
   seeking the Lord! It is with this he begins. "Behold, he prays," that
   is, he seeks the Lord. He has begun to be conscious of his sin. He is
   seeking pardon of the Lord. He has begun to be aware of his danger--he
   is seeking salvation in the Lord. He is now aware of his powerlessness
   and he is looking for strength to the Lord. Those deep convictions,
   those cries and tears, that repenting and humbling and, above all,
   those acts of simple confidence in which he casts himself upon the
   great Atonement made upon Calvary's bloody tree--those are all acts of
   seeking the Lord! Now, perhaps some of you have got no farther than
   this. Well, you shall have your proportion of blessing, according to
   your strength. You shall have your share in it, little as you are. He
   will give to His children at the table their portion, as well as to
   those who have grown to manhood.

   After a man has attained unto eternal life by confiding in the Lord
   Jesus, he then goes on to seek the Lord in quite another way. No
   wonder! Since he has found the Lord, or rather has been found of Him,
   and yet he still presses on to apprehend Him of whom he has been
   already apprehended! He still presses forward, seeking the Lord, and he
   seeks the Lord thus. He seeks, now, to know the Lord's mind, the Lord's
   Law and will. "Show me what You would have me to do," he says. "Lord, I
   went by my own wit, once, and I brought myself into a dark forest--I
   lost myself--I was at Hell's brink and You did save me. Now, Lord,
   guide and direct me. Be pleased to teach me. Open my lips when I speak.
   Guide my hands when I act. I wait at Your feet, feeling that--

   "For holiness no strength have I, My strength is at Your feet to lie."

   The man now seeks the Lord by daily and constant prayer, seeking that
   he may be upheld, guided, constrained in paths of righteousness and
   restrained from the ways of sin. He becomes a seeker of the Lord after
   sanctification, as once he was after justification. And then he becomes
   a seeker of the Lord in a further sense. He seeks to enjoy the Lord's
   love and His gracious fellowship and communion. He seeks to get near in
   reverent friendship to his Lord. He now longs to grow up in the
   likeness of Christ, that his conversation with the Father and the Son
   may be more close, more sweet, more continuous. He feels that God is
   his Father and that he is no longer at a distance from Him in one
   sense, for He is made near by the blood of the Cross. Yet sometimes he
   is oppressed with a sense of his old evil heart of unbelief and in
   departure from the living God--and he cries out, "Draw me nearer to
   Yourself!" In fact, his prayer is always--

   "Nearer my God to Thee,

   Nearer to Thee--

   Even though it is a Cross that raises me, Still all my cry shall be,
   Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee."

   He seeks the Lord's company. He delights to be in God's house and at
   God's Mercy Seat, and at the foot of the Cross, where God reveals
   Himself in all His Glory! He is constantly crying for a larger capacity
   to receive more of God. And the longing of his soul is, "When shall I
   come and appear before God?" He feels that he never shall be satisfied
   till he awakes in the Lord's likeness. Now, all this, which may be
   private within him and scarcely known to any, operates practically in
   an outward seeking of the Lord which makes the man's life to be
   sublime. The genuine Christian lives for God. He makes the first
   objective of all that he does, the Glory of God, the extension of the
   Redeemer's Kingdom, the showing forth of His praise who has brought him
   out of darkness into marvelous light. He is a young man, an
   apprentice--he has been converted and he says, "Now, what can I do
   while I am in this house to make it better, to make it happier and
   holier, that men may see what the religion of Jesus is? How can I
   recommend my Lord and Master to those among whom I dwell--to my master
   and my mistress and my fellow servants?" He becomes a tradesman on his
   own account, and when he opens that shop door he says, "I do not mean
   to trade for myself. I will make this to be my objective, that this
   shall be God's shop. God has got to keep me--He has promised that He
   will--therefore, I may take what I need for the daily subsistence of
   myself and my children, but I will keep the shop for God, for all that,
   and if He prospers me, I will give Him of my substance, but whatever
   comes of it, I will so trade across my counter, so keep those books and
   manage those bills that I will let the world see what a Christian
   trader is! And I will seek thus to recommend my Lord and my God--and my
   objective shall be to make Him famous."

   He seeks the Lord on Sundays. He desires at the Sunday school, or the
   preaching station, or anywhere he may serve, to be glorifying God. But
   he equally seeks Him on Mondays and other weekdays, for he believes
   there is a way of turning over calicoes, weighing pounds of tea,
   plowing acres of land, driving a cart, or whatever else he may be
   called to do, by which he can honor God and cause others to honor Him.

   Now, I say very solemnly--I hope I am mistaken in what I say, but I
   fear I am not--I am afraid there are many professors who would tell a
   lie if they said that they sought God always in their business, for
   though they are the members of a Church and you would not find them out
   in anything seriously inconsistent, yet their whole life is
   inconsistent because for a Christian to live for anything but the Lord
   Jesus Christ is inconsistent! It is inconsistent to the very root and
   core, to the tenor and aim, the supreme objective of life, altogether
   inconsistent! A man has a right to live, to bring up his family, to
   educate them and see them comfortably settled in life--but that ought
   to be only for God's Glory! His acting as a father is expected, for if
   a man cares not for his own household, he is worse than a heathen and a
   publican--that God may be glorified by his doing is his duty! But when
   I see some people putting by their thousands and getting rich for no
   sort of reason that I know of, except that people may say, "How much
   did he leave behind him?" how can I believe that those professors, as
   they take the sacramental cup, are doing anything but drinking
   condemnation unto themselves? When I see some Christians who profess to
   be living for nothing but to be respectable and to be known, and
   honored and noticed, but never seem to care about the souls of men, nor
   about Christ's Glory--never shedding a tear over a dying sinner nor
   heaving a sigh over this huge and wicked city, which is like a
   millstone upon the neck of some of us, like a nightmare perpetually
   upon our hearts--when I see these men so cold, so indifferent, so
   wrapped up in themselves, what can I think but that their religion is
   but a cloak, a painted pageantry for them to go to Hell in, which shall
   be discovered at the last and be a theme for the laughter of the
   fiends? Oh, may God grant that we may all be able truly to say, "I seek
   the Lord. I am sure, I am certain that I seek Him," for if we can feel
   that that is true, then we can take the promise of thetext. If not, we
   may not touch it. If we, as professing Christians, are not at top and
   bottom in heart, and soul, and spi-rit--and in all that we do--really
   seeking the Glory of God, the promise does not belong to us! But if we
   can, from our very souls, declare, "Notwithstanding a thousand
   infirmities, yet, Lord, You know all things: You know that I love You
   and that I seek Your honor," then this is true of us, and no one of us
   shall need any good thing!

   Just a word or two more about this, for we must discriminate thoroughly
   well before we come to the promise. It is too rich and precious to be
   bestowed upon the wrong persons and there are some who hope to get this
   promise, who feel that they must not take it. We must be among those
   who seek the Lord heartily, not merely saying that we do, or wishing
   that we did but, filled with the Holy Spirit, and in the power of His
   blessed residence in our souls, we must be heartily panting after God's
   Glory! Otherwise I do not see that we can put our hands on the promise
   without presumption. We must be seeking it honestly, too, for there is
   a way of seeking God's good and your own at the same time--I mean
   having a sinister and selfish motive. We may preach and not be
   preaching only for God at all. A man may live in the Sanctuary, in holy
   engagements from morning until night and yet may never ardently,
   intensely, seek the Lord. A man may be a great giver to charities, a
   great attendee at Prayer Meetings, a great doer of all kinds of
   Christian work and yet he may never seek the Lord, but may yet be
   seeking to have his name known, to be noted as a generous man, or be
   merely seeking to get merit to himself, or self-complacency to his own
   conscience. It is a downright honest desire to serve and glorify God
   while we are here that is meant in the text. If we have got it and I
   think we may readily see whether we have or not-- then is the word of
   the Psalmist true to us.

   We must seek God's Glory heartily, honestly, and we must seek it most
   obediently. A man cannot say, "I am seeking God's Glory," when he knows
   he is disobeying God's command in what he is doing. How can I say that
   I am desiring to glorify God by following a pursuit which is sinful, by
   giving loose to my anger and speaking rashly? By giving rein to my
   passions, by indulging my own desires, by being proud and domineering
   over my fellow Christians, or by being pliant, fearful, timid after an
   unholy sort and not being bold for God and for His Truth? No, we must
   watch ourselves very narrowly and cautiously. We must be very careful
   of our own spirits. We soon get off the line. Even when we are keeping
   correct outwardly, we may be getting very inconsistent inwardly by
   forgetting that the first, last, midst and sole objective of a
   blood-bought spirit is to live for Christ--and that if saints on earth
   were what they should be, they would be as constantly God's servants as
   the angels are in Heaven--they would be as much messengers of God in
   their daily calling as the seraphs are before the eternal Throne of
   God! Oh, when will the Spirit of God lift us up to anything like this?
   The most of us are still hunting after things that will melt beneath
   the sun, or rot beneath the moon! We are gathering up shadows to
   ourselves, things which have no abiding substance--we are seeking self,
   seeking anything rather than the blessed God! Lord, forgive us this sin
   wherein we have fallen into it, and make us truly such as truly seek
   the Lord! Now, let us be prepared to behold--

   II. THE PROMISE OF THE REWARD OF SUCH SEEKING.

   "They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing." That is, not
   one of them. They that first stepped into Be-thesda's pool were
   healed--but no others. But here everybody that steps into this pool is
   healed! That is to say, everyone that seeks the Lord has this
   promise--the least as well as the greatest--the Little-Faiths and the
   Much-Afraids as much as the Great-Hearts and the Standfasts. They that
   seek the Lord, whether they are chimneysweeps or princes, whether they
   are tender children or seasoned veterans in the Master's great
   army--they shall want no good thing. "Well, but," somebody says, "there
   are some of them that are in need." They are in need? Yes, that may be,
   but they are not in need of any good thing. They cannot be. God's Word
   against anything you say, or I say. If they seek the Lord, they shall
   not, they cannot, they will not need any good thing! "Well, at any
   rate, they need what appears to be a good thing." That is very
   likely--the text does not say they shall not be. "Well, but they need
   what they once found to be a good thing! They need health--is not that
   a good thing? It was a good thing to them when they had it before, yet
   they need health. Does not that go against the text?" No, it does not
   in any way whatever! The text means this--that anything which is
   absolutely good for him, all circumstances being considered, no child
   of God shall ever need. I met with this statement in a work by that
   good old Puritan, Mr. Clarkson, which stuck by me when I read it some
   time ago. I think the words were these, "If it were a good thing for
   God's people for sin, Satan, sorrow and affliction to be abolished,
   Christ would blot them out within five minutes! And if it were a good
   thing for the seeker of the Lord to have all the kingdoms of this world
   put at his feet, and for him to be made a prince, Jesus would make him
   a prince before the sun rose again!" If it were absolutely to him, all
   things being considered, a good thing, he would have it, for Christ
   would be sure to keep His Word. He has said he shall not want it, and
   He would not let His child want it, whatever it might be, if it were
   really, absolutely, and in itself, all things considered, a good thing!
   Now, taking God's Word and walking by faith towards it, what a light it
   sheds on your history and mine! There are many things for which I wish,
   and which I sincerely think to be good, but I say at once, "If I have
   not got them, they are not good, for if they were good, good for me,
   and I am truly seeking God, I would have them--if they were good
   things, my heavenly Father would not deny them to me--He has said He
   would not, and I believe His pledged Word." I think sometimes it would
   be a good thing for me if I had more talents, but if it were a good
   thing I would have more, I would have them. You think it were a good
   thing if you were to have more money. Well, if He saw it to be good,
   you would have it. "Oh," you say " but it wouldhave been a good thing
   if my poor mother had been spared to me--if she were alive, now, it
   would have been a good thing and it would certainly be a good thing for
   us to be in the position I was five years ago before these terrible
   panic times came." Well, if it had been a good thing for you to have
   been there, you would have been there. "I don't see it," says one.
   Well, do not expect to see it, but believeit! We walk by faith, not by
   sight. But the text says so. It says not that every man shall have
   every good thing, but it does say that every man that seeks the Lord
   shall have every good thing. He shall not want any good thing, be it
   what it may. "Well, I doubt it," says one. Very well. I do not wonder
   that you do, for your father, Adam, doubted it, and that is how the
   whole race fell! Adam and Eve were in the Garden, and they might have
   felt quite sure that their heavenly Father would not deny them any good
   thing, but the devil came and whispered and said to them, "God knows
   that in the day you eat of the fruit of that tree, you will be as gods!
   That fruit is very good for you--a wonderfully good thing--never
   anything like it--and that one good thing God has kept away from you."
   "Oh," said Eve, "then I will get it," and down we all fell! The race
   was ruined through their doubting the promise! If they had continued to
   seek the Lord, they would not have needed any good thing. That fruit
   was not a good thing to them--it might have been good in itself, but it
   was not good for them or else God would have given it to them--and
   their doubting it brought all this terrible sorrow on us. So it will
   upon you, for let me show you--you say, perhaps, "It would be a very
   good thing for me to be rich." God has stopped you up many times. You
   have never prospered when you thought you were going to. You will put
   out your hand, perhaps, to do a wrong thing to be rich, but if you say,
   "No, I will work, and toil, and do what I can, but if I am not
   prospered, it is not a good thing for me to be prospered, and I would
   not do a wrong thing if it would bring me all the prosperity that heart
   could desire." Then you will walk uprightly and God will bless you. But
   if you begin to doubt it and say, "That is a good thing and my heavenly
   Father does not give it to me," you will, first of all, get hard and
   bitter thoughts against your heavenly Father. And then you will get
   wicked thoughts and wrong desires--and these will lead you to do wrong
   things, and God's name will be greatly dishonored thereby. How do you
   know what is a good thing for you? "Oh, I know," says one. That is just
   what your child said last Christmas. He was sure it was a good thing
   for him to have all those sweets! He thought you very hard that you
   denied them to him, and yet you knew better. You had seen him before
   made so ill through those very things he now longed for. And your
   heavenly Father knows, perhaps, that you could not bear to be strong in
   body--you would never be holy if you had too robust health. He knows
   you could not endure to be wealthy--you would be proud, vain, perhaps
   wicked--you do not know how bad you might be if you had this! He has
   put you in the best place for you. He has given you not only some of
   the things that are good for you, but all that is good for you! And
   there is nothing in the world that is really, solidly, abidingly good
   for you, but you either have it now, or you shall have it before long.
   God your Father is dealing with you in perfect wisdom and perfect love,
   and though your reason may begin to cavil and question, yet your faith
   should sit still at His feet and say, "I believe it. I believe it, even
   though my heart is wrung with sorrow. I am a seeker of God. I seek His
   Glory and I shall not need any good thing."

   I think someone in the congregation might say to me, "Look at the
   martyrs. Did not they seek the Lord above all men?" Truly so, but what
   were you about to object? "Why, that they needed many good things. They
   were in prison, sometimes in cold, and nakedness, and hunger. They were
   tormented on the rack. Many of them went to Heaven from the fiery
   stake." Yes, but they never needed any good thing. It would not have
   been a good thing to them, as God's martyrs, to have suffered less, for
   now read their history. The more they suffered, the brighter they
   shine. Rob them of their sufferings and you strip their crowns of their
   gems! Who are the brightest before the eternal Throne of God? Those who
   suffered most below! If they could speak to you now, they would tell
   you that that noisome dungeon was, because it enabled them to glorify
   God, a good thing to them! They would tell you that the rack whereon
   they did sing sweet hymns of praise was a good thing for them because
   it enabled them to show forth the patience of the saints and to have
   their names written in the book of the peerage of the skies! They would
   tell you that the fiery stake was a good thing because from that pulpit
   they preached Christ after such a fashion as men could never have heard
   it from cold lips and stammering tongues! Did not the world perceive
   that the suffering of the saints were good things, for they were the
   seed of the Church? They helped to spread the Truth of God and, because
   God would not deny them any good thing, He gave them theirdungeons, He
   gave them their racks, He gave them their stakes--and these were the
   best things they could have had, and with enlarged reason, and with
   their mental faculties purged, those blessed spirits would now choose
   again, could they live over again, to have suffered those things! They
   would choose, were it possible, to have lived the very life and to have
   endured all they braved to have received so glorious a reward as they
   now enjoy!

   "Ah, well, then," says one, "I see I really have not understood a great
   deal that has happened to me. I have been in obscurity, lost my
   friends, been despised, felt quite broken down--do you mean to tell me
   that that has been a good thing?" I do. God has blessed it to you. He
   will enable you to say, "Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now
   have I kept Your Law." And if you get more Grace, you will say it is a
   good thing, for is it not a good thing for you to be conformed to the
   likeness of Christ? How can you be, if you have no suffering? If you
   never suffered with Him, how can you expect to reign with Him? How are
   you to be made like Him in His humiliation, if you are never humbled?
   Why, I think every pain that shoots through the frame and thrills the
   sensitive soul helps us to understand what Christ suffered. And being
   sanctified, gives us the power to pass through the torn veil, and to be
   baptized with His baptism, and in our measure to drink of His cup and,
   therefore, it becomes a good thing! And our Father gives it to us
   because His promise is that He will not deny or withhold any good thing
   from those that walk uprightly.

   I feel, Brothers and Sisters, as though my text were too full for me to
   go on with it! There is such a mass in it, and if you will take it home
   and turn it over at your leisure, you may do with it better than I can,
   if I attempt wire-drawing and word-spinning. There is the text. It
   seems to me to speak as plainly as the English tongue can speak. Give
   yourselves wholly up to God and live for Him, and you shall never want
   anything that is really good for you! Your life shall be the best life
   for you, all things considered in the light of eternity, that a life
   could have been! Only mind you keep to this-- the seeking of the Lord.
   There is the point of it! Get out of that, and there may be some
   promise for you, but certainly not this one! You have got out of the
   line of the promise--but keep to that and seek the Lord--and your life
   shall be, even if it is a poverty-stricken one, such a life that if you
   could have the Infinite intelligence of your heavenly Father, you would
   ordain it to be precisely as it now is! "They that seek the Lord shall
   not want any good thing."

   Why, how rich this makes the poor! How content this makes the
   suffering! How grateful this makes the afflicted! How does it make our
   present state to glow with an unearthly glory! But, Brothers and
   Sisters, we shall never understand this text fully, this side of
   Heaven. There we shall see it in splendor. They that seek the Lord here
   shall have up yonder all that imagination can picture, all that fancy
   could conceive, all that desire could create. You shall have more than
   eye has seen, or ear has ever heard! You shall have capacities to
   receive of the Divine fullness, and the fullness of the pleasures that
   are with God shall be yours forevermore!

   But, again I come back to that, are you seeking the Lord? That is a
   question I have asked my own heart many and many a time--Do I seek the
   Lord's Glory in all things? I ask it of you, you young men who are
   starting in business. Now, you know you can, if you like, go into
   business for yourselves. I mean you can make your trade tell for
   yourselves, and live to yourselves, and the end will be miserable and
   the way to it will not be happy. But if God's Spirit shall help you
   young men and women early in life to give your hearts to Jesus, and to
   say, "Now, God has made us so we will serve Him that made us. Christ
   has bought us, so we will serve Him that bought us. The Spirit of God
   has given us a new life, so we will live for this new and quickening
   Spirit"--then I do not stand here to promise you ease and comfort, for
   in the world you shall have tribulation, but I do say, in God's name,
   that He will not withhold one good thing from you, and that when you
   come to be with Him forever and ever, you will bless Him that He did
   for you the best that could be done even by Infinite Wisdom and
   Infinite Love. You shall have the best life that could be lived, the
   best mercies that could be given and the best of all good things shall
   be yours here and hereafter.

   There may be some here, however, who have long passed the days of youth
   and up till now have never had a thought of their Maker. The ox knows
   his owner and the ass his master's crib, but they have not known God.
   If you keep a dog, he fawns on you and follows at your heels. There is
   scarcely any creature so ignorant but what it knows its keeper. Go to
   the Zoological Gardens and see if those animals that are most deficient
   in brains are not still obedient to those that feed them! Yet here is
   God, good and kind to a man like you, and you have lived to be 40 and
   have never had an idea of loving and serving Him! Have you sunk lower
   than the brutes? Think of that! But Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners such as you. Repent! May God's Eternal Spirit lead you to
   repentance of this great sin of having lived in neglect of God, and
   from henceforth, seeking pardon for the past through the Atoning
   Sacrifice, and strength for the future through the Divine Spirit, seek
   the Lord and you shall find that you shall not need any good thing. The
   Lord bring you there and save and bless you eternally! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM34.

   "A Psalm ofDavid when he changedhis behavior before Abimelech, who
   drove him away, andhe departed."

   It was a very painful exhibition and one in which David does not shine,
   but in which, nevertheless, the Providence and Grace of God are very
   conspicuous. And it is very pleasant to find a man of God penning such
   words as these after his escape.

   Verse 1. I wiil bless the LORD at all times: His praise shall
   continually be in my mouth. After any very great deliverance, we feel
   prompted to special gratitude. And it appears to us as if we never
   should leave off praising God. I wish that perpetuity were real, but,
   alas, it often happens that the next cloud that sweeps the skies brings
   back our doubt and our fears--and our song is over. It ought not to be.
   Our heart's resolve should be, "I will bless the Lord at all times. His
   praise shall continually be in my mouth."

   2. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. What else is there to
   boast about? But what a proper subject for boasting, the Lord is,
   because it is legitimate boasting! We can never exaggerate--we can
   never speak too well or think too well of God! He is high above our
   thoughts when they are at the best, so that we may make them as big as
   we may and we shall never be guilty of extravagance!

   2. The humble shall hear thereof and be glad. Humble souls cannot,
   generally, endure boasting, but boasting in God is very sweet to them.
   He that will make God great will always be a choice favorite with a
   broken spirit. Those that are little in themselves delight to hear of
   the Glory of God.

   3. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together It is
   too grand a theme for one! One little heart can scarcely feel it all!
   One feeble tongue cannot tell it out. Come, then, you saints that know
   His name--magnify the Lord with me!

   4. I sought the LORD and He heard me, and delivered me from all my
   fears. Blessed be His name for this. Are there not many of you, dear
   Friends, who can bear the same testimony--personal proof of a
   prayer-hearing God? You tried Him, for you sought Him. You tried Him
   and you found Him true, for He delivered you from all your fears.

   5. They looked unto Him and were lightened: and their faces were not
   ashamed. Only a look--and their burden was gone. Only a look! What
   great things hang on little things! Faith is but a look, yet it brings
   life, pardon, salvation! Heaven comes that way. Only a look!

   6. 7. Thispoor man cried, and the LORD heardhim, andsavedhim out
   ofallhis troubles. The angel ofthe LORD encamps round about them who
   fear Him, and delivers them. The angel of the Lord does not merely come
   to help His people, but he stays with them. He encamps. He has pitched
   his tent, for he means to tarry. The guardians of God forsake not their
   charge. They encamp about them who fear Him, for their deliverance.

   8. O taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man that
   trusts in Him. It is the grandest of benedictions! It is the sum and
   substance of the Gospel! "Blessed is the man that trusts in Him." By
   the way of works we are cursed, but by the way of believing we are
   blessed. Are you trusting? Dear Heart, are you trusting? Is it a feeble
   trust? Are you often much tried and distressed? Yet if you are
   trusting, you are blessed! God pronounces you so--do not let your faith
   waver about it, or suffer the devil to tell you that you are accursed,
   for you cannot be! You are blessed.

   9. O fear the LORD, you His saints: for there is no need to them that
   fear Him. Sometimes their wishes are not granted, but there is no real
   need. They shall have all necessaries, if they do not have all
   luxuries.

   10. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger. Strong as they are, and
   crafty as they are, they sometimes howl because of their hunger.

   10. But they who seek the LORD--Though they have no craft, no courage,
   no strength and no foresight.

   10. Shall not need any good thing. Plead that, tried child of God!
   Plead it! Plead it if you are in need tonight--if you are in any form
   of need--plead this gracious Word of God!

   11. Come, you children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
   ofthe LORD.

   A Sunday School teacher's text! Gather the children close to you. Say,
   "Come near me. I would be familiar with you." It was a king who spoke
   these words, and yet he delighted to say, "Come, you children." Win
   their attention. "Hearken unto me." If they do not hear, how shall they
   understand? "And I will teach you the fear of the Lord." That is your
   subject--pure religion--heart religion--spiritual religion! I will
   teach you the fear of the Lord."

   12. What man is he that desires life?What man is he that does notdesire
   life? Love of it is innate in us all.

   12, 13. Andloves many days, that he maysee good?Keep your tongue from
   evilandyour lips from speaking guile. He begins with one of the hardest
   practical duties of the fear of God, for he that bridles his tongue is
   also able to bridle the whole body! The tongue is such an unruly member
   that if that is kept--and only through Divine Grace can it be so--then
   we may be quite certain that all the other organs and faculties will be
   kept, too.

   14. Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it A great deal
   packed away into a small compass there. There is the negative, "Depart
   from evil," and the positive which must go with it, "Do good." And if
   you do not do good, you will soon do evil. And then there is that
   blessed precept--"Seek peace." Hunt after it if you cannot find it. And
   if it runs away from you, follow it--pursue it--hunt after it till you
   gain it! A peaceable life is a happy life.

   15. The eyes ofthe LORD are upon the righteous. He watches them. He
   loves them too well to let them ever be out of His sight. He views them
   with complacency. He regards them with affection. The eyes of the Lord
   are upon the righteous.

   15. And His ears are open unto their cry. Ready to hear their feeblest
   prayer--the cry of their pain--their distress. His ears are always
   open.

   16. The face ofthe LORD is against them that do evil Sets His face
   against them.

   16-17. To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous
   cry and the LORD hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.
   Here is an explanation of the experience of the Believer--first,
   prayer--then God's hearing and then deliverance. Who would not pray who
   has found prayer to be so effectual with God?

   18, 19. The LORD is near unto them that are of a broken heart; andsaves
   such as are ofa contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions ofthe
   righteous: but the LORD delivers him out of them all. The first line
   seemed to have something terrible in it--"Many are the afflictions of
   the righteous." But there is a blessed, "but," that comes in--thrown
   like the tree into Marah's bitter stream to sweeten it all!

   20, 21. He keeps all his bones: not one of them is broken. Evil shall
   slay the wicked. Their own evil shall be their destruction! They need
   nothing more than to be allowed to go on in sin! Sin is Hell. The fire
   of corruption is the fire of perdition. Evil shall slay the wicked!

   21, 23. And they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. The LORD
   redeems the soul of His servants: and none of them who trust in Him
   shall be desolate. How grandly does David preach the Gospel! We need
   not look to Paul to learn salvation by faith! The Psalms are full of
   it. We have had it just before. "Blessed is the man that trusts in
   Him." And now, again, "None of them who trust in Him shall be
   desolate." They are sinful, but they shall not be desolate. They often
   feel as if they were utterly unworthy, but they shall not be desolate.
   They are, sometimes downcast, but they shall not be desolate. They may
   be hunted by trials, afflictions and temptations of the Devil, but they
   shall not be desolate! They may come to the bed of pain and to the
   chamber of death, but they shall not be desolate! They shall stand
   before the Judgment Seat of Christ, but they shall not be desolate--not
   one of them--for it is written, "None of them that trust in Him shall
   be desolate."

Christ and His Hearers

   (No. 3410)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners to hear Him, and
   the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This Man receives sinners
   and eats with them." Luke 15:1,2.

   SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS always seeks to blame others and to whitewash
   itself. The group that stood nearest to Christ in preaching was
   composed of two classes of persons--the publicans, or tax-gatherers and
   the open sinners. Now the Pharisee, when he came to speak of these two
   classes, called them by one name, lumping them all under one
   description and calling them all sinners. Now, although the publicans,
   or tax-gatherers, were very generally taken from the lowest class of
   Jews, and their calling of tax-gathering, never in itself, too popular,
   was in their particular case very objectionable, yet we have no reason
   to believe that all tax-gatherers were necessarily profane, or
   licentious, or dishonest. There were bad and good among those Jewish
   tax-gatherers, as well as among all other classes of mankind! Yet,
   because they were looked upon as being of the lowest class, the
   Pharisee spoke of them as if they were all "sinners." This is a common
   habit, I am afraid, with the Too-Goods--with those who have never felt
   their own sinfulness, to always use the worst names they can and to put
   as bad a color as they can upon the characters of other men. I wish we
   had learned to do the very reverse, namely, to try to see all the good
   we can in our fellow creatures, which were far more like Christ, rather
   than to condemn them wholesale, and impute the faults of some to a
   whole class. The Holy Spirit here speaks of "publicans andsinners"--the
   evil spirit in the Pharisee calls them all sinners. Let us imitate the
   Spirit of God and not the spirit ofpride.

   But I said that self-righteousness tries to whitewash itself, for did
   not these Pharisees, when they murmured that Christ received sinners,
   intend to say that as He did receive them, they were not sinners? No,
   they would not have blushed, for they were rather honest in their
   self-righteousness--perhaps more honest than we are--they would not
   have blushed to have said, "We have thanked God that we are not as the
   publicans, and not as the sinners." They did not reckon themselves as
   belonging to the class of offenders and breakers of the Law of God.
   They were holy! They were the separated ones! They were a peculiar
   people, zealous for good works after their own estimation, though not
   in the sight of God. Alas, how easy it is for us to try to make
   ourselves appear to be better than we really are! We are full of
   sin--our nature is deceitful and vile, and yet we try to draw up a good
   balance sheet, if we can, of our spiritual trading! We represent that
   to be sound which is rotten, and that to be accepted which is
   dishonored. Oh that we could but see ourselves as God sees us! We would
   never again, then, dare even to thinka good thought of ourselves out of
   Christ, but abhorring ourselves in dust and ashes, we would wrap His
   righteousness about us! We would plunge into the crimson fountain of
   His blood and never hope to be accepted except in the Beloved! May God
   grant us Grace to beware of the least touch of self-righteousness, for
   it is evil, only evil and that continually! May we always be as timid
   as the publican who stood afar off and dared not even lift up his eyes
   to Heaven, rather than be as censorious and presumptuous as the
   Pharisee, whose sole prayer consisted in flattering himself that he was
   better than others.

   Having thus introduced to you the Pharisees, the publicans and the
   sinners, let us now come to the text, itself, and observe that
   publicans and sinners were attracted to the ministry of Christ. The
   first question at this time shall be--what attracted them? Then
   secondly, what in the Gospel should attract us? And thirdly, what came
   of their being attracted, and what comes to us, also, of our being
   attracted by the Gospel?

   First, then, it seems that when Christ preached, He was surrounded by a
   number of persons of very loose character, and others of the lowest
   calling who pressed to Him to hear Him.

   I. WHY DID CHRIST'S HEARERS COME?

   They were genuine hearers--it was a bona fide audience. I mean by that,
   that they were not like the crowds who followed Christ up the
   mountain--who followed not to hear Him, but to eat of the loaves and
   the fishes. These publicans and sinners were not thinking of the loaves
   and fishes. They were none of those who, like the old people in some
   parishes,go to Church in order to get the loaf of bread on the Sunday
   morning. They were real, bona fide hearers, who really went to hear.
   They were a genuine, earnest, and honest audience--and they pressed
   around Him to listen to Him. Why did they do this?

   I will tell you why they did not. They certainly were not attracted to
   Christ by any ceremonialism which Christ used, or any kind of pomp or
   show of priestcraft in His dress. It is said that the working classes
   do not attend places of worship because we do not dress ourselves in
   white, and blue, and green, and I do not know what other colors
   besides--in fine because we do not make fools of ourselves! It is said
   that people will not come to hear us because of this, but our Lord
   Jesus Christ never put on anything like a priestly vestment in His
   life! The common dress in which He robed Himself was "a garment without
   seam, woven from the top throughout," or rather, the usual dress of the
   East. There was nothing whatever in His garb that was distinctive. John
   the Baptist, it is true, put on prophetic robes--the rough robe of
   hair-skin and some have used that same rough garment to deceive, but
   Christ was perfectly a Man among men. I may venture to say that whoever
   else was a clergyman, Jesus Christ was not, and whoever else was a
   priest, as one of a priestly caste set apart from the people, He was
   none. He was just a Man among men. He ate as they ate, and drank as
   they drank. He toiled as other carpenters have done in the carpenter's
   shop, and when He came to speak in public, He spoke like one of the
   people. His authority was not derived from His robes! He had not to
   step into the vestry and put on His garments to get His dignity. His
   dignity was in the Man, Himself, in the Spirit that filled the Man.
   That which attracted people to Him was certainly nothing external and
   had nothing to do with milliner's shops, but was something far other
   than that.

   Again, the publicans and sinners certainly did not come to Christ to
   hear Him because of His laborious reasoning. The working classes of
   London, we are told, if they are ever to be brought to places of
   worship, need that we should argue with them, and prove to them the
   existence of God, the Divinity of Christ, the truth of the Bible and
   all such things--and they are not led by our dogmatism! That is the
   statement that is made. I believe it to be as false as those who say it
   is impertinent. I do not find our Savior ever trying to prove that
   there is a God. I do not find Him standing up and continually
   apologizing! His mode of address is, in the strongest sense, and I
   grant you in a sense far above what you and I could claim to adopt,
   dogmatic! "Verily, verily, I say unto you." That is His argument. "I
   testify what I do know, and what I have seen of the Father," and He
   bears witness to the Truths of God with a full, down-right certainty
   which does not admit of a doubt! True, He has an answer for the
   Sadducees, but it is curt, sharp and decisive. And He goes on His way
   to preach His own Gospel, which is evidently His delight and His forte.
   No, if publicans and sinners came to Christ, they did not come to Him
   to be amazed with the display of intellect or to be dazzled with the
   remarkably judicious manner in which He would handle a debate! They
   came for some other reason than that.

   Again, if they came to Jesus Christ, they certainly did not come
   because of His trimming Doctrines. He was not one who excused sin, or
   who made it out to be a weakness, incidental to human nature. No, He
   denounced sin in the most burning terms! They did not come to Him
   because He was one who preached smooth things with regard to the
   punishment of sin. No, my Brothers and Sisters, of all the preachers
   that ever lived, none ever preached on the wrath of God in such
   terrible terms as Jesus Christ, Himself! Though He was full of
   tenderness and full of love, yet you hear Him speak of the worm that
   never dies, and of the fire that never shall be quenched! He loved
   men's souls too well to make them think that sin was a trifle! He loved
   them too well to let them run the risk of everlasting woe without
   warning them of it in the plainest terms. No, if any sat at Jesus' feet
   to learn of Him, it was not because their conscience remained
   unmolested and they were lulled by siren strains into a deadly sleep!
   His spirit-stirring words must often have sent bolts right through and
   through their consciences! They did not, therefore, go because He used
   fair speech and so amused the people, and lulled them to sleep in sin!

   Once more, if the publicans and sinners listened to Christ in crowds,
   it was not because of His vehement gesticulation or His declamation. He
   was not a preacher who was at all given to the stamping of the foot.
   "He shall not strive, nor cry, nor His voice be heard in the streets."
   The bruised reed He shall not break, and the smoking flax He shall not
   quench. He opened His mouth and spoke, and He spoke with matchless
   oratory, for "never man spoke like that Man." But it was all simple and
   plain. You see no traces of logic. There are no signs of rhetoric. You
   do not catch Him for a moment, as it were, seeking so to awaken the
   emotions as to ignore the intellect, and so to stir the passions as if
   men were only children to the frightened or to be cajoled. He speaks to
   them as men! He appeals to their entire nature and while the Truths He
   utters are full of pathos that stir the very depths of the soul, yet
   are they gentle and quiet, and His speech distils as the dew and drops
   as the rain. Let none think that they can win a congregation by the
   mere force of gesticulation. Jesus did not so.

   What then, was it that attracted these people? They were not generally
   sermon-hearers. Look at that fellow, there with his ink bottle. He will
   look up the Jew that has forgotten to pay his tribute to Caesar. He is
   very quick about that,but he is not a man who is at all likely to
   attend theological discussions. Do you see that villain, there, with
   the low forehead? Why, I do believe he is the very man who was tried
   and who only escaped with his life upon a doubtful point at the last
   Passover! And there is that woman--oh, yes, there can be no doubt about
   her character! You know her, and what she is. Do you see them there?
   They are all listening, not with their ears, only, but with their very
   eyes and mouths they are drinking in every word that Man is saying as
   He talks to them about the lost sheep and the lost son. What is it that
   enthralls them? What are the golden chains that come from His mouth and
   hold these by their ears? What can the secret be? I think it lay partly
   in this, that He was a Man awfully in earnest. As they looked up to
   Him, they all felt that He was a real Man. The Pharisees were starched
   with decorum and full of affectation. These people were too
   simpleminded, though wicked, to believe in the Scribes and
   Pharisees--and so they went their way to their own haunts and never
   regarded their teaching. But with half an eye, they could see standing
   there a Man unaffected, sincere and in earnest, who was speaking of
   something which He, Himself, believed, and speaking it with power and
   force because He felt it in His soul! Oh, never was there such an
   earnest preacher as the Master! No idle word has He to give account of!
   No words to recollect that lack results because they came not fresh
   from the Speaker's heart! All He speaks is to the point and all of it
   came deep from His heart's inmost self. This drew the people to Him.

   They were attracted, too, no doubt, because He honestly touched their
   consciences. It would be supposed, my Brothers and Sisters, that the
   very intelligent, wise, rational and seemly Doctrine of Unitarianism,
   as we are commonly told it is, would everywhere be attended by
   crowds--but there are scarcely any places in which that Doctrine is
   preached in which you might not catch any number of spiders, and study
   the whole science of entomology as far as these interesting creatures
   are concerned! How is this? Why, as one said, once, "The people know in
   their hearts somehow or other, I cannot tell how, that this that you
   preach is not true. Although it looks so well and so rational, and
   seems to flatter them so much, yet they do not come to hear it, for in
   their hearts they know it is not true." It is a strange thing that if
   the old evangelical Doctrines should appear for one moment to be beaten
   in a debate, they always conquer in results. I shall defy any man to
   maintain a Church prosperously, or to keep up a denomination which is
   built upon unsound Doctrine with anything like prosperity during a term
   of years. The bubble shines and glitters, but it is too thin to last,
   and it goes. Now, after all, the worst men like to hear a preacher who
   will dash at their consciences, who will tell them what they, in their
   inner selves, know to be true! And as Jesus Christ never flinched from
   this, but told them just what was fact, the people delighted to gather
   round Him and to listen to His speech.

   Moreover, and I doubt not that this was the great charm they
   perceived--that He intensely loved them, that He did not preach the
   Truths of God merely that it might cause philosophic speculation and
   because He was highly pleased to teach it, but because He wanted that
   Truth to raise, to bless, to comfort, to save them and to make them
   happy. The Pharisee, if he ever spoke to a publican or a sinner, would
   do it with a long space between them, gathering up his robes for fear
   of contagion, looking down upon the sinner as though the teacher were
   so much above the taught. But Christ came right among them, and was one
   of them--and He looked as if He would do anything for them if He might
   but deliver them from their sins. They knew this, and it was this
   mighty charm that embraced them and made them linger till the voice had
   done, and then carry away the echoes of those loving tones in their
   memories for many a day afterwards.

   Besides that, I doubt not that another charm of Christ's preaching lay
   in this, that He always preached Doctrine that was hopeful to them.
   While He said, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees," He had loving
   words for weary and heavy-laden ones. While He denounced
   self-righteousness, He would turn round and say, "I came not to call
   the righteous, but sinners to repentance." If He ever had a frown upon
   His brow, it was for the hypocrite and the proud man, but He had tears
   for sinners, He had loving invitations for penitent ones. Like a good
   physician, He sought out morally sick folk and sought to restore them
   to spiritual health. This it was, also, that helped to attract them to
   Christ.

   Now, my dear Hearers, I believe that if you would tell me your
   characters, I could tell you whether, if Jesus Christ were here now,
   you would be likely, habitually, to hear Him or not. If you are a very
   excellent person who never did anything wrong. If you feel yourself a
   deal above most people. If you have a proper sense of your own dignity,
   and if you are much impressed with your own importance, I believe that
   you would have murmured at Christ. And I am quite sure that you would
   not have been in the throng that drew near to hear Him. But if you are
   sensible that you have been guilty. If you confess that you have broken
   God's Law. If you are anxious to be forgiven, or if you are conscious
   that you are forgiven, but still need to be daily washed, to be daily
   kept, to be daily dealt with in tenderness and love--oh, you are the
   men and women who would have made a bodyguard about that Prince of
   Preachers, for as surely as His Doctrine was meant for you as the rain
   comes down upon the mown grass, so was your state of mind meant for the
   Gospel! And you and the Savior would be quite sure to stand in near and
   proper relationship to one another!

   But we cannot linger, and must pass on, now, to the second point--

   II. WHAT IS THERE IN THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST THAT DOES NOT ATTRACT SOME OF
   US, BUT OUGHT TO ATTRACT US ALL?

   Very briefly, there is this in the Gospel that attracts my soul and I
   will speak for others. Ever since we fell out with God through sin, the
   thought of God has been dreadful to us. We have been afraid of Him. But
   Jesus Christ is God and He has taken upon Himself our manhood. And now
   He tells us that we may come to God through Him--in fact, that if we
   come to Him, when we have seen Him, we have seen the Father! Now, as I
   want to be one with God, and yet shudder at the thought of coming to
   Him, my soul burns with fervent affection towards Christ! And when I
   see that I can come to God so safely and so sweetly by coming through
   Him, that attracts me.

   Next, ever since we were awakened to a sense of what sin is, sin has
   been a great burden to us. We have offended against God, and we know
   it. Oh, that this offense could be blotted out! Now, Jesus Christ comes
   and shows that, altogether without a violation of justice, God can put
   away all our sins as if they had never been! The Gospel tells us that
   Christ becomes a Substitute for us, that He was punished instead of all
   those who believe in Him, so that the Law takes effect, Justice is
   satisfied and yet God is gracious. I know when I first learned that
   Truth of God, my heart was ravished with it. I have read books,
   sometimes, that have kept me up at night to read them, or I have got
   hold of ideas that have almost made me dance when I have got them--but
   that old idea of Substitution--oh, Sirs, it was the brightest day I
   ever lived when I learned that--that the Lord has laid on Him the
   iniquity of us all! You know, an awakened conscience cannot play with
   sin as some of you do and imagine that God can easily forgive sin--but
   when the conscience is awakened, it feels that God cannot forgive sin
   without exacting the punishment that is due to sin! Then there comes in
   to meet this difficulty the fact that Christ is punished in the place
   of the Believer--that God is just, and yet the Justifier of him that
   believes. Here is another precious Truth that has attracted many of us
   to Christ. I pray God that it may attract many others to Him. Here is
   the way of pardoned sin and here is the way of access to God!

   Brothers and Sisters, we feel in ourselves so many inabilities, we
   cannot do anything right! We feel that we cannot pray. There are times
   when, if we gave a world for it, we cannot shed a tear, when we cannot
   make our hard hearts melt, cannot get repentance out of these dry
   souls! Oh, but then this attracts me to Christ, to find that He can
   give me all Grace--that in Him all fullness dwells, that His Spirit
   helps our infirmities and that just as I am--wounded, broken, sin-sick,
   hard, cold and dead-- Christ comes and meets my case! Oh, how this
   ought to attract us to Christ!

   And then oftentimes the fear comes up to every awakened man--"Shall I
   hold on? If I begin to be a Christian, shall I hold out to the end?
   Will not temptation yet lead me astray?" Then Christ comes in and says,
   "Because I live, you shall live also. I give unto My sheep, eternal
   life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of
   My hands." Oh, Savior, this is a silken bond to draw us to Yourself!
   Was there ever a greater attraction than this--all safe in Christ! The
   lambs of the flock, the weakest ones, all safe! The man of imperious
   passions, the man with once imperious lusts--all safe when once they
   put themselves in the hands of Christ! Then can we all say, "I know
   whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that
   which I have committed to Him until that day." But the thought comes
   over us sometimes, "Ah, but what will it be to die?" That hour of
   death--how grim it looks! And, indeed, it never is child's play to
   die--to pass into the unknown and the invisible! The naked spirit--to
   leave the body behind--it to become food for worms. The bravest man may
   well turn pale here! But oh, the attraction of Christ is, "He that
   believes in Me shall never die. Though he were dead, yet shall he
   live." Oh, the thought of resurrection! The thought that death is
   changed, no longer to be a penal sentence, but to be merely an entrance
   into Heaven! The thought that--

   "Jesus will make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are, While on
   His breast we lean our head And breathe our life out sweetly there."
   The thought that He will come and meet us, and that our spirits, side
   by side with His, shall pass through the iron gate with a song upon our
   lips, and fear no terror as we pass by the gates of the grave! My
   Brothers and Sisters, this woos us to Christ! This holds us to Christ!
   This charms and fascinates us! This is a faith that well sustains us,
   that blots out the past, that brightens the present and lights up the
   future with the expectation of the glory to be revealed!

   My Hearer, if you have never had Christ, do you not desire Him? Man, if
   Christ is yours, Heaven is yours. Man, if you believes in Christ, this
   night, your transgressions shall be forgiven you! You shall become a
   child of God, an heir of immorality! Do you not need a Savior? Will you
   not ask for one? Oh, yield you, yield you now to Him who was given for
   you, who round you now, the cords of His love would cast, binding you
   fast to His altar! God grant in His Infinite Mercy that the attractions
   of the Gospel may be known to us all! And now, in the last place--

   III. WHAT CAME OF IT?

   Those who were attracted first to hear were, according to the second
   verse, still further blessed. The Pharisees said, not--"This Man
   preaches to sinners," but, "This Man receives sinners and eats with
   them." It is a great blessing when the Gospel is preached to sinners,
   but oh, it is a far greater blessing when sinners are received, when
   sinners come to eat with Christ. The Pharisees left out what they ought
   to have mentioned, that when Christ received sinners, He did not leave
   them sinners. It is no disgrace to say of a certain doctor in London,
   "Why, it is said that that doctor has had some of the most horrible
   cases in London. I saw one man, there, with a dreadful cancer. Another
   was taken in that was subject to epilepsy. I saw one with a leprosy
   taken into that physician's house." Is that any disgrace to the
   physician? Why, Sir, the thing is how did they come out? What were they
   after his skill had been exerted upon them? What they were when they
   went into the hospital is no disgrace to the hospital--it may even
   reflect honor upon the wisdom of those who exercised their skill within
   it. So that Christ receives sinners is true, but He first makes them
   penitent sinners! He makes them believing sinners! He changes their
   nature! He turns the lion into a lamb, the raven into a dove--and then
   when He has done this, when He has washed away their sins and changed
   their natures--He receives them to be His friends! None are so near to
   Christ as blood-washed sinners! He receives them to be His disciples!
   None could sit at His feet but those who first have been washed in His
   blood. Then He receives them as His servants. None can serve Him who
   have not first been served by Him. Then He receives these sinners to be
   His advocates. He sends them out to preach His Gospel, but He never
   sends any out to preach the Gospel unless, first of all, they have
   received Him into their hearts as the Gospel of their salvation. "This
   Man receives sinners."

   Oh, I wish that tonight the Lord would find the biggest sinner in the
   Tabernacle! I might say, if there were such a person present, one
   commonly known to be the biggest blackguard in the parish, I wish the
   Lord would light on just such an one, for the raw material for a great
   saint is often a great sinner! When the devil wanted to make the
   biggest sinner that ever lived, he took an Apostle to be the raw
   material, namely, Judas, and made him the son of perdition. But when
   Christ wanted the greatest of preachers, and the best of all the
   Apostles, He went right into the devil's camp and laid hold of Saul of
   Tarsus--and made him become Paul, the mighty winner of souls! "This Man
   receives sinners." The thief, the drunkard, the harlot--He still
   receives them! He washes them, changes them, takes them into His
   society, lifts them up--takes the beggar from the dunghill and makes
   him sit among princes. Oh, mighty Master, do this deed of Grace again
   and though the Pharisees will murmur and the proud may still slander
   Your name, we who are sinners, too, will clap our hands for very joy
   and bless Your love and adore Your Grace, world without end! "This Man
   receives sinners."

   And then they said, "And eats with them." Yes, in a mystical sense you
   will see that done again tonight, for here is the TABLE, the Lord's
   Table, peculiarly so, and to that Table let no man come who has never
   been a sinner, for he will not be welcome! Let no man come who has not
   felt himself to be a sinner, for he will not be welcome. If there is a
   man that is rich in good things and that is full of good things, let
   him not come, for, "He has filled the hungry with good things, but the
   rich He has sent away empty." If there is a handmaiden here of low
   estate and humble mind, let her come, for He has remembered the low
   estate of His handmaiden. But if there are any that are great and
   mighty, and exalted in their own estimation, let them stand aside and
   hear Him say, "He has put down the mighty from their seat, and He has
   exalted them of low degree." Here is a Table spread for sinners,
   sinners blood-washed, but still sinners. I often feel, my Brothers and
   Sisters, as if I could not come to the Cross anyway but as a sinner. I
   think I told you this parable once. Once there was a great king who
   used to have a table spread every day, and there were two sorts of
   persons who had a right to come there. All round the king, on his right
   and left, sat the princes of the blood and the nobles of the highest
   rank. They came in their robes of state and there they sat, and they
   were welcome. At the other end of the table, the king in his bounty had
   bidden his chamberlain every day spread many dainty dishes for beggars,
   and if there were any in the city at any time who were foot sore, who
   were houseless and homeless, ragged and hungry, the notice was given
   that anyone who could plead abject poverty might come to the king's
   table. Now, it so happened once on a time that a prince of the blood
   had lost, as he thought, the deeds of his estate. Moreover, he had lost
   the register of his birth and he was afraid that all that he had ever
   possessed had never been rightly his own. Perhaps he was some
   changeling child, he said, for such things had been. Perhaps his
   estates were not his own, and as the time came round for the feast, he
   felt as if he did not dare put on his robes lest he should be shown to
   be an impostor. But then it flashed across his mind, "If I have been an
   impostor up till now, and I am not the son of my reputed father. If the
   estates and the rich gems I have, are not mine, then I am a poor beggar
   and I have not anything." So he took off his fine garments and found
   some common dress that had been laid aside. "I must sit at the king's
   table somewhere," he said, "and if I cannot go as a prince, I will go
   as a beggar and so, one way or the other I will eat of his banquet."
   Brothers and Sisters, I have often had to do that, and I would advise
   you to do it whenever your doubts and fears come across you. If Jesus
   Christ cannot receive you and you cannot come to Him asa saint or as a
   child of God, remember, that "This Man receives sinners and eats with
   them." Come with all your sins! Come, I say, and you cannot be cast
   out!

   Many years ago the shaft of a mine was blocked up by some falling
   earth, and there was no chance of the miners' escape. They gathered
   themselves together and held a Prayer Meeting in expectation of a
   speedy death, for it did not seem probable that they would ever be able
   to get out by the shaft, which was so thoroughly destroyed. While they
   were in prayer, a happy thought struck one of the older miners. He had
   heard that there was an old shaft which led into another mine, which
   had been given up, and he said he would go first and perhaps they might
   be able, by going through some old passages, to come out into the old
   mine. He knew from what he had heard his father say, that much of it
   was very low, and water dripped into it, and that in some places they
   would have to keep on all fours. But for all that, he said, it would
   not matter so long as they could but get to the daylight again. They
   could not go up the regular shaft, but away they went, creeping down
   the back ways, all through the mire, mud, and filth, and dirt and
   darkness--but they came to the light at last and all came up safe to
   their homes again.

   Now, sometimes when I can look straight up to my Lord, I know that I am
   His child. I do tonight, and I can rejoice to go up and down the shaft
   straight ahead. But, Brothers and Sisters, if ever you cannot do that,
   there is an old working, there is an old way, the way that all the
   saints have gone. You will have to go on your hands and knees. You will
   have to go on all fours. You will find it flooded with tears of
   repentance, but never mind, the devil himself cannot block up that way.
   If you cannot come as a saint, come as a sinner! If you have got no
   Grace, you can get Grace. If you cannot come with a tender heart, come
   fora tender heart. If you cannot come with faith, come to get faith,
   for "this Man receives sinners and eats with them." May this Blessed
   Man come and eat with us tonight!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 15:11-32.

   Verses 11-13. And He said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger
   of them said to his father, Father, give me theportion of goods that
   falls to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days
   after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into
   a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. It
   was an act of ingratitude to leave his father at all--an act of extreme
   folly to turn his father's goods to ill-account.

   14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land
   and he began to be in need.And the sinner's greatest all will be spent
   one day! The pleasures of sin are but for a season. The strongest sinew
   in an arm of flesh will one day crack. The flowers that grow in man's
   garden will one day fade--man may think he has an eternity of pleasure
   before him, but if he is looking to the flesh for it, it shall be but
   for an hour.

   15. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he
   sent him into his fields to feed swine. At the very best, the comforts
   of this world are ignominious to a man. They degrade him--as it was a
   very degrading employment for a Jew to feed swine--so the comfort the
   world can give to a man does but degrade his noble spirit.

   16. And he would gladly have filled his belly with the husks that the
   swine did eat, but no man gave unto him.The prodigal cannot be brought
   any lower! He is made to herd with the swine, and he envies even them
   because they are satisfied with the husks! He cannot eat of the same
   and, therefore, he envies even the brutes! Surely, when a sinner
   becomes fully convinced of sin, he may well envy even the sparrows or
   the serpents because they have not sinned!

   17-20. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
   my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I
   will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
   sinned against Heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be
   called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants. And he arose,
   and went to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father
   saw him.Remember Matthew Henry's pa-raphrase?--Here were eyes of mercy.

   20. And had compassion--Here was a heart of mercy. 20. And ran Here
   were legs of mercy. 20. And fell on his neck Here were deeds of mercy.
   20. And kissed him And here were lips of mercy.

   21- 22. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven
   and in your sight and am no more worthy to be called your son. But the
   father said to his servants Here were words of mercy, wonders of mercy
   and, indeed, it is all mercy throughout!

   22- 25. Bring forth the best robe andput it on him; andput a ring on
   his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring here the fatted calf and
   kill it; and let us eat and be merry: For this, my son, was dead, and
   is alive again; he was lost, and isfound. And they began to be merry.
   Now his elder son was in the field. That is where these over-good elder
   sons always are--they are out at work--they are not at home in
   communion with God! They are in the field! Do not ask who the elder
   brother was--he is here tonight--there is many an envious
   moralist--yes, and an envious professor, too, who feels it hard that
   profligate offenders should be pardoned!

   25-27. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and
   dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
   meant. And he said unto him, Your brother is come; and your father has
   killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound. And
   he was angry. He did not want the fatted calf killed! If this reprobate
   brother were allowed to come in at the back door and to eat with the
   servants, he thought that quite good enough, but for this rebel to be
   put upon an equality with himself--he could not bear that!

   28. And would not go in: therefore came his father out and entreated
   him. See the tenderness of this father? The same arms which embraced
   the sinning one, were also ready to clasp the self-righteous one! I
   always feel great pity and great admiration for this dear, dear father.
   What with a bad son and a good son, he had two bad sons, for this good
   son, you see, had got in a pet just as I have seen some real Christians
   get into a very un-Christian frame of mind! Well, they do not like,
   somehow, receiving into their company the women who have gone
   astray--the men who have lost their reputation. He was angry and would
   not go in--and now his father crowned his love. He ran to meet one son
   and now he comes out to reason with another who is unnaturally and
   ungraciously angry with him.

   29. Andhe, answering, said to his father, Lo, these many years do
   Iserve you, neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and
   yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. I
   know the brother. He says, "I have been a consistent Christian. I have
   been diligent in the service of God. I have abounded in prayer and yet
   all the daylong have I been plagued and chastened every morning. I do
   not get much joy--I have such a sight and sense of temptation and sin
   that I am generally low spirited. I seldom get a drop of full
   assurance. I never get a kid given me, that I might make merry with my
   friends." Those who are under the Law never do make merry. You never
   knew a man yet that was trying to save himself by keeping the
   Commandments of God that could dare to make merry. No, they have to
   draw long faces, and well they may, for they have a long task before
   them! They put on a garb of sadness, being of a sad countenance, as the
   hypocrites are!

   31, 32 But as soon as this, your son, was come, who has devoured your
   living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf And he
   said, to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is
   yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this,
   your brother, was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found.
   And so, dear Friends, there is more joy over the prodigal when he
   returns, than over the man who thinks he never has been astray!

Joining the Church

   (No. 3411)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING
   OCTOBER 24, 1869.

   "And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves
   unto the Lord, and unto us by the will of God." 2 Corinthians 8:5.

   SOME persons are always trying to prove what is customary in the
   Christian Church. They are always seeking after instances and
   precedents. The worst of it is that many of these people look for old
   things that are not old enough--the old things of the Church of Rome,
   for instance, and mediaeval customs and observances which are nothing
   but authentic trumpery! If they want the real old solid things, they
   should go back to the Apostolic times. The best book of Church history
   from which to gather ritual, true ritual, is the Acts of the Apostles!
   And when the Christian Church shall go back to that, instead of
   enquiring about what the primitive Christians did in the second or
   third century, she will come much nearer to the knowledge of what she
   ought to do!

   Now, our text tells us of one old custom in the Apostles' days. Those
   who became Christians first gave themselves to the Lord and then they
   gave themselves to the Church, according to God's will. Let us ponder
   these things in their order. Of course we shall think of the main and
   most important point first--that action which gives value and beauty to
   all that follows and is its fruit--

   I. THE SOUL'S SUPREME GIFT

   The first thing that the original Christians, the Christians of the old
   and Holy Spirit times did was, "they gave themselves unto the Lord."
   This is vital, the one all-important bestowal. Have all of us who are
   professors that we are Christ's disciples really given ourselves to the
   Lord? Are there not in this House of Prayer some who have never thought
   of doing so, and even some who would reject with contempt the idea of
   doing so? Oh, my Hearers, the day will come when you will look at these
   matters in a very different light! And in the next world it will be
   seen that it would have been your highest wisdom to have given
   yourselves to the Lord--and your supreme folly to have lived unto self!

   When these early Christians gave themselves to the Lord, the first
   thing manifestly was that the giving and the gift were sincere. Should
   any here present have given themselves to the Lord, let them ask
   themselves whether their gift was sincere. These primitive Believers
   meant what they said. There was a deep reality about their
   consecration--they gave themselves over to Jesus Christ to be entirely
   His. Remember that in those times this meant very much more than we are
   ever made to suffer now. A man who gave himself to Christ in those days
   was put out of the synagogue if he was a Jew. He was cast out of
   society if he happened to be a heathen. He was dragged up before the
   tribunals. He was frequently cast in prison--as frequently beaten with
   many stripes--and very often he was put to death by fire, or by the
   sword. But these early Christians knew what was to happen and, knowing
   it, yet deliberately they gave themselves up to the Lord. Oh, dear
   professors here present, has your gift of yourselves to Christ been as
   sincere as that, or did you merely come and make a profession because
   others did? And have you stuck to that profession, lie though it was,
   because you did not like the shame of confessing that you had made a
   mistake? Oh, is it sincere or not? If it is not, God make it so, for it
   is only that which is of the heart that will stand the trial of the
   Last Great Day! Lord, deliver us from having any religion in which the
   heart is not found!

   Their gift of themselves to the Lord was, in the next place, a willing
   gift. All the soldiers of Christ are volunteers and yet they are all
   pressed men. The Grace of God constrains men to become Christians, but
   yet only constrains them consistently with the laws of their mind! The
   freedom of the will is as great a truth as is the Predestination of
   God. The Graceof God, without violating our wills, makes men willing in
   the day of God's power--and they give themselves to Jesus Christ. You
   cannot be a Christian against your will! How could it be? A servant of
   God against his will? A child of God against his will? No, it never was
   so and it never shall be so! Here and now, you Christians, I shall ask
   you whether you are not cheerfully, gladly, unreservedly the servants
   of God! I know you are and that bond you made years ago is not irksome
   to you now, but if you are genuine saints, you repeat it again tonight
   and you hope to repeat it in life and in death, for you are willingly
   and exultantly the Lord's own!

   The gift that these early Christians made was, in the next place, an
   intelligent one. They did not receive into the Church in Paul's days
   unintelligent people. They knew that no sponsorship could avail here.
   They knew, as one would think all rational people ought to know, that
   the religion of Jesus Christ cannot exist where there is no clear
   apprehension of the saving Truth of God.

   Only where the understanding was able to grasp the Saviorship of Jesus
   could there be spiritual life and true conversion. No religious rite,
   or ceremony, or ordinance could confer this. I have heard ministers
   tell their congregations, "You were made Christians in your infancy and
   you ought to stand to the vows then made for you." Surely every man's
   conscience tells him there is not a shadow of ground for such
   reasoning! What have I to do with, or what do I care about vows that
   were made for me when I was a child? Were they bad or were they
   good--they never consulted me and I have nothing to do with them, nor
   will I have! Whether they promised that I would serve God, or that I
   would serve the devil, I equally reject their responsibility and their
   sponsorship! As an intelligent being, I speak for myself before God and
   none shall speak for me! If I had been dedicated to Moloch, should I in
   my manhood accept the dedication? God forbid! And even if I were
   dedicated to Christ, I will not accept a dedication which I know Christ
   never accepted because He never asked for it. He asks my personal
   dedication. He asks only for intelligent love, intelligent service--and
   I trust that many of you came to Christ knowing what you did, knowing
   what repentance meant, knowing what faith meant, having counted the
   cost of what a life of holiness would be and then deliberately, as men
   and women of judgment and understanding, said, "O Prince, we enlist
   beneath Your banner! O Immanuel, write our names in Your muster-roll,
   for we will be Your servants from now on and forever!" It was a sincere
   gift, it was a willing gift and it was an intelligent gift that these
   first Christians made of themselves to the Lord!

   My Brothers and Sisters, it was, moreover, a complete surrender which
   they made. No Christian in the olden times gave himself in part to the
   Lord and in part reserved himself for idols, or for himself--and had
   any attempted to have done so, they would have been spurned, for it is
   of Christ's rule in the Church that He will have all or none. You must,
   as a Christian, be all a Christian, or nothing of a Christian! There is
   no such thing as dividing between God and the devil, between
   righteousness and sin. The surrender must be without reserve and
   without limit. If you have truly given yourselves to the Lord, you have
   given Him your body--no more to be polluted with sin, but to be a
   Temple of the Holy Spirit. You have given Him your mind--no more to be
   a free thinker after the boasted free thought of the slaves of
   skepticism. You have given up your faculties--to sit with them at the
   feet of Christ to learn of Him, to take His teaching for the Truth of
   God and His Word the one court of appeal for all questions. You take
   Him to be your Teacher beyond all dispute and His Doctrine to be
   unsullied truth for you. You have also given up to Him your tongue to
   speak for Him, your hands to work for Him, your feet to walk or run for
   Him--your every faculty of body and mind in beautiful partnership for
   His service!

   As for your newborn, angelic, spiritual nature--that must emphatically
   be the Lord's--and will always be the royal and reigning power within.
   You are today in the trinity of your nature--body, soul and
   spirit--altogether Christ's! And this includes, if you are a sincere
   Christian, all that you have--all of talents, all of time, all of
   property, all of influence, all of relationship, all of opportunity.
   You count nothing to be your own from this time forth, but you say with
   the spouse, "I am my Beloved's and my Beloved is mine."

   Again, the surrender which every true Christian makes is a surrender to
   the Lord. That, my Brothers and Sisters, is where it must begin--with
   the Lord! We ought not to give ourselves up to the Church until we have
   given ourselves up to the Lord. And it must never be a giving of
   ourselves up to priests. Oh, scorn that! Of all the wretches that live,
   the worst are priests! Of all the curses that ever fell upon earth--I
   will not except even the devil--the worst is priestcraft! I care not
   whether it wears the garb of the dissenting minister, or the clergyman
   of the Established Church, or the Roman Catholic, the Muslim or the
   heathen--no man can do your religion for you! If any man pretends that
   he can, or that hecan pardon your sin, or do anything for you before
   God, put him aside--he is a base impostor! Never surrender your
   thoughts or your mind to any man. Pin your opinions to no man's coat
   sleeves. To the Lord make the surrender complete and ample--to His
   Truth, to His Law, to His Gospel make your surrender as complete as if
   you made yourselves slaves, or a stone to be carved by His hands! You
   shall rise in dignity as you sink in selfhood. You shall become free in
   proportion as you wear God's bonds. You shall become great as you
   become little in yourselves. Give yourselves wholly up to God. Mind it
   is to Him--not to any man, not to any creed, not to any sect--but
   wholly and entirely to the Lord who loved you from before the
   foundation of the world! To the Lord who bought you with His heart's
   blood! To the Lord whose Spirit sealed your adoption within your souls!

   Mind this, then! Mark it as the first step in all public acts of
   religion--you must give yourselves first to the Lord! You have no right
   to talk about joining a Christian Church until you have done
   that--"first to the Lord." You have no right to be baptized until you
   have done that--"first to the Lord." You have no right to sit at the
   Communion Table until you have done that--"first to the Lord." Give
   yourselves first to the Lord with unfeigned repentance for sin and
   simple and hearty confidence in Jesus! And then, as a complete
   giving-up of yourselves to the Lord--you may come to every hallowed act
   of service, to every privilege-feast of love--but not until then! Oh,
   Sirs, your sacraments and your ceremonies--God abhors them until first
   you have given Him your hearts! Vain are your oblations! Your incense
   is an abomination to Him! It is an evil, and worse than an evil--it is
   a mockery of God, an insult to Him--until first your heart surrenders
   itself to Jesus and your manhood becomes the rightful property of God
   by your willing yielding of it to

   Him!

   I cannot press this matter by way of questioning everyone present, but
   still I would like to ask of every conscience, especially of every
   professing Christian, to answer this question, "My Soul, have you given
   yourself up, through the Grace of God, to belong to the Lord?" Do you
   mean that, or is it a farce? Have you made it real, or is it all a
   sham? Do you feel within your soul tonight a desire to make it more
   complete a gift? Do you pray for Grace to make it perfect in the
   future? Do you rest alone upon the precious blood of Jesus? Then do you
   desire to glorify God so long as you are in this body? Oh, then 'tis
   well with you and you may go the next step with me. If not, hands off
   all ordinances, hands off all promises! There is nothing in the Bible
   and there is nothing in the Church for you until you first are
   reconciled to God by the death of Jesus Christ1 And now let us turn to
   consider briefly the second giving of the soul--

   II. THE GIFT THAT FOLLOWS THE SUPREME ONE.

   I want to know this passage aright. I think I do. "They first gave
   their own selves to the Lord, and unto us"--that is, they gave "their
   own selves" unto us--by the will of God. After a true Christian has
   given himself or herself to the Lord, the very next act should be to
   give themselves to the Christian Church. They should at once assay, as
   Paul did, to be united to the Brethren of Christ. Somewhere in the
   district where he lives, if there is a Christian Church, the newborn
   Believer should at once seek fellowship with others who love his Lord,
   because saved by His Grace. The right way to do this is to give
   himself. Not his name, his money, not his mere presence, his sympathy,
   his active labors--all these are part of the gift--but the soul of it
   all is to give himself. In the whole force and weight of his influence,
   personality and ability, as far as God shall help him, he is to give up
   to the Church.

   What is involved in this giving up of ourselves to the Christian
   Church? I will repeat it, so as to refresh the memories of many members
   here who have forgotten it. It is your dutyto be united to the
   Christian Church. What does that mean? What duties spring out of it?
   There is, first, consistency of character If you make no profession of
   religion and live as you like--you shall answer for that at the Last
   Great Day. But if you join a Christian Church, take heed how you live,
   for your actions may become doubly watched--and will be doubly sinful
   if you fall into inconsistency! You are a servant in the family and a
   member of a Christian Church--there must be in you no eye-service!
   There must be about you nothing which would dishonor a good servant of
   Jesus Christ! You are a husband--you have no business to be a
   bad-tempered, domineering tyrant to your wife! If you are, you ought
   not to be a member of a Christian Church at all! You are a wife-- you
   ought not to be an untidy, idle, novel-reading woman, neglecting your
   family duties! If so, I do not care what classes you attend, or what
   Prayer Meetings--you have no business to act like that and profess to
   be a Christian! You are a Christian, you say, and have joined the
   Church--then in your trade you have no business to fall into the tricks
   and knavery that are common on all sides! If you cannot live without
   being a rogue, do not be a professor of religion! It will be quite as
   well for you to go to Hell at once, as you are, as to go there with a
   millstone about your neck through having made a profession, a base and
   wicked profession, of godliness which you did not carry out. No, Sirs,
   if you will not, in the strength and spirit of God's Grace, strive
   after consistency of moral conduct, you have no right to talk about
   giving yourselves to the Church, which you will disgrace! You will only
   sin yourselves into a deeper condemnation. Therefore, stay away from
   it!

   The next thing that is required of every member of Christ's Church is
   attendance upon the means of Grace. I do not mean merely Sunday
   attendance. Any hypocrite comes on a Sunday, but they do not, to my
   knowledge, all of them, come on Monday to the Prayer Meeting, nor all
   to the weeknight service on a Thursday. I am pretty certain of this,
   though some of them may. Weeknight meetings and services are a powerful
   test. Many cannot come, I know, and I do not ask that domestic duties
   be sacrificed, even for public worship. But there are some who ought to
   be present who are not and, indeed, all of you, so far as opportunity
   will permit, and if you reside within reasonable distance, should come.
   Take care that you do not become lax in that respect.

   Another duty of all Church members is to aid and comfort one another.
   Just as among Freemasons--give the grip and you get a kindly word and a
   brotherly recognition--so should it be among Christians, only in a
   higher sense. You must comfort those that mourn, help those who are
   poor and, in general, we ought to watch out for each other's interests,
   seeing that in the Church we are all members of one family. You are to
   "do good unto all men, especially unto such as are of the household of
   faith." Let your crumbs be given to the sparrows out of doors, but let
   your Brothers and Sisters have the most and best of what you can give!
   This is the plain duty of every Christian.

   Every Church member, too, is to try to give himself to the Church in
   the sense of doing his share in all Church work. Shame on the Church
   member who has no post that he can occupy, who is neither generous with
   his purse, nor diligent with his hands, nor earnest with his heart, nor
   speaking with his tongue! You cannot all do all, but each must take his
   place and niche, for everyone who is doing nothing--what is he but a
   drone in the hive who will surely be expelled before long? I hope, my
   dear Friends, I can say that I did this when I joined the Church of
   Christ. I well remember how I joined it, for I forced myself into the
   Church of God by telling the minister--who was lax and slow--after I
   had called four or five times and could not see him, that I had done my
   duty and if he did not see me, I would call a Church Meeting, myself,
   and tell them I believed in Christ and ask them if they would have me!
   I know when I did it, I meant it! I know there was not one among them
   all who more intensely meant it, then, and I mean it now! I give myself
   up to Christ and to Christ's religion. I do not mind speaking upon
   politics when they touch upon Christianity. I do not mind helping on
   the common cause of philanthropy, or any work for the good of my follow
   men--but to no work do I give myself with my whole heart and spirit but
   to that of spreading abroad the knowledge of Christ's name! This, I
   think, ought to be to the Christian the first and last thing. Does your
   religion cover your drapery, or your drapery your Christianity--which,
   Sir? You are a politician--right enough--I am glad that there should be
   an honest man in such a place. Does your religion, however, cover your
   politics, or do your politics devour your religion? You are a working
   man. Well, it is an honorable position and all honor to the
   hard-working man--but does your religion permeate and give quality to
   your hard work? Do you love Christ with it all? Do you feel all the
   while that, most of all, you must be a Christian? Then I do not care
   what you are, whether you are a blacksmith or a chimney-sweep, a king
   or a crossing-sweeper--it is of small account! First and foremost, must
   you be a Christian and all else must be subordinated to that--for this
   the Christian Church has a right to expect.

   Now I know there are some who say, "Well, I hope I have given myself to
   the Lord, but I do not intend to give myselfto any church, because_."
   Now, why not? "Because I can be a Christian without it" Now, are you
   quite clearabout that? You can be as good a Christian by disobedience
   to your Lord's commands as by being obedient? Well, suppose everybody
   else did the same? Suppose all Christians in the world said, "I shall
   not join the Church." Why there would be no visible Church! There would
   be no ordinances! That would be a very bad thing and yet, one doing
   it--what is right for one is right for all--why should not all of us do
   it? Then you believe that if you were to do an act which has a tendency
   to destroy the visible Church of God, you would be as good a Christian
   as if you did your best to build up that Church? I do not believe it,
   Sir! Nor do you, either. You have not any such a belief--it is only a
   trumpery excuse for something else. There is a brick--a very good one.
   What is the brick made for? To help to build a house with. It is of no
   use for that brick to tell you that it is just as good a brick while it
   is kicking about on the ground as it would be in the house. It is a
   good-for-nothing brick! Until it is built into the wall, it is no good!
   So you rolling-stone Christians, I donot believe that you are answering
   your purpose--you are living contrary to the life which Christ would
   have you live-- and you are much to blame for the injury you do! "Oh,"
   says one, "though I hope I love the Lord, yet if I were to join the
   Church, I would feel it such a bond upon me." Just what you ought to
   feel! Ought you not to feel that you are bound to holiness, now, and
   bound to Christ, now? Oh, those blessed bonds! If there is anything
   that could make me feel more bound to holiness than I am, I should like
   to feel that fetter, for it is only liberty to feel bound to godliness,
   uprightness and carefulness of living!

   "Oh," says another, "if I were to join the Church, I am afraid that I
   would not be able to hold on." You expect to hold on, I suppose, out of
   the Church--that is to say, you feel safer in disobeying Christ than in
   obeying Him! Strange feeling, that! Oh, you had better come and say,
   "My Master, I know Your saints ought to be united together in Church
   fellowship, for Churches were instituted by Your Apostles--and I trust
   I have Grace to carry out the obligation. I have no strength of my own,
   my Master, but my strength lies in resting upon You--I will follow
   where You lead and leave the rest to You."

   "Ah, but," says another, "I cannot join the Church--it is so
   imperfect." You then, are perfect, of course! If so, I advise you to go
   to Heaven and join the Church, there, for certainly you are not fit to
   join it on earth and would be quite out of place!

   "Yes," says another, "but I see so much that is wrong about
   Christians." There is nothing wrong in yourself, I suppose? I can only
   say, my Brother, that if the Church of God is not better than I am, I
   am sorry for it. I felt, when I joined the Church, that I would be
   getting a deal more good than I should be likely to bring into it. And
   with all the faults I have seen in living these 20 years or more in the
   Christian Church, I can say, as an honest man, that the members of the
   Church are the excellent of the earth in whom is all my delight--though
   they are not perfect, but a long way from it! If, out of Heaven, there
   are to be found any who really live near to God, it is the members of
   the Church of Christ.

   "Ah," says another, "but there are a rare lot of hypocrites." You are
   very sound and sincere yourself, I suppose? I trust you are so, but
   then you ought to come and join the Church to add to its soundness by
   your own. I am sure, my dear Friends, none of you will shut up your
   shops tomorrow morning, or refuse to take a sovereign when a customer
   comes in because there happen to be some smashers about who are dealing
   with bad coins! No, not you! And you do not believe the theory of some,
   that because some professing Christians are hypocrites, therefore all
   are, for that would be as though you would say that because some
   sovereigns are bad, therefore all are bad--which would be clearly
   wrong, for if all sovereigns were counterfeits, it would never pay for
   the counterfeiter to try to pass his counterfeits! It is the quantity
   of good metal that passes off the bad. There is a fine good quantity of
   respectable golden Christians still in the world and still in the
   Church--rest assured of that!

   "Well," says one, "I do not think--though I hopeI am a servant of
   God--that I can join the Church. You see, it is so looked down upon."
   Oh, what a blessed look-down that is! I do think, Brothers and Sisters,
   there is no honor in the world equal to that of being looked down upon
   by that which is called, "Society," in this country! The most of people
   are slaves to what they call, "respectability." Respectability? When a
   man puts on a coat on Sunday that he has paid for. When he worships God
   by night or by day. Whether men see him or not--when he is an honest,
   straightforward man--I do not care how small his earnings are, he is a
   respectable man! And he need never bend his neck to the idea of Society
   or its artificial respectability!

   These various kinds of humbug, for they are no other, keep many from
   joining the Christian Church because they are afraid of being looked
   down upon by respectable people in Society. I read in a paper only
   yesterday that it would be no use to create Nonconformist peers,
   because in the next generation they would cease to be Nonconformist and
   become respectable in their religion--and I am afraid it is true! It is
   outrageous that as soon as some persons rise in social position they
   renounce the Church to which they gave themselves when they gave
   themselves to the Lord! The day will come when the poorest Christian
   will be exalted above the proudest peer that did not fear God--when God
   will take out of the hovels and cottages of England a peerage of an
   Imperial race that will put to the blush all the kings and princes of
   the world! And these He will set above the seraphim when others will be
   cast from His Presence!

   I say to any of you who will not join this Church because doing so
   would lower your respectability--neither I or Jesus Christ asks you to
   join it! If these are the gods you worship--Society and
   Respectability--go to your beggarly gods and worship them, but God will
   require it of your hands in the Day of Account. There is nothing better
   than the service of Christ! For my own part, to be despised, pointed
   at, hooted in the streets, called by all manner of evil names--I would
   accept it all, sooner than all the stars of knighthoods and peerages if
   the service of Christ necessitated it, for this is the true honor of
   the Christian when he truly serves his Master! The day is coming when
   the Lord will divide between those that love Him and those that love
   Him not--and every day is getting ready for that last division. This
   very night the division is being made! In the preaching of the Gospel
   it is being carried out. Let each man take his stand and ask himself
   the question--Are you with Christ or with Belial? Are you with God,
   with Christ, with the precious blood, or do you still rank with sinful
   pleasures and their delights? As you will have to answer for it when
   the skies are on a blaze and the earth reels, and the Judgment trumpet
   summons you before the Great White Throne, so answer it now! And you
   brave spirits who have loved your Savior--if you have never yet joined
   His army, come and enlist now! And you loving spirits who are tender
   and who have shrunk back awhile, come forward now--

   "You that are men now serve Him

   Against unnumbered foes!

   Your courage rise with danger,

   And strength to strength oppose." Today stand up for Jesus! Today be
   willing to be the off-scouring of all things for His name's sake. And
   then, when He comes in His Glory, yours shall be the reward, a reward
   that shall far outweigh any losses that you can sustain today! "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." "He that with his heart
   believes and with his mouth makes confession shall be saved." Believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ and may His blessing rest upon you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 CORINTHIANS 8.

   The Apostle is writing concerning a certain collection which was being
   made for the poor saints of Jerusalem. It was from Jerusalem that the
   Gospel had spread into Greece and, therefore, those who had received
   spiritual things from the poor Jews at Jerusalem were bound by every
   tie of holy brotherhood to remember their benefactors in the time of
   famine. The Apostle stirs up the Corinthian Church about this
   contribution.

   Verse 1. Moreover, brethren, we make known to you. Or, "we make you to
   know."

   1, 2. Of the Grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia. How
   that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and
   their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their generosity. It is
   good to stir one Christian up by the example of another and Paul
   excites those at Corinth by the example of the Churches in
   Macedonia--especially, no doubt, the Church at Philippi. He says that
   they were in great affliction and they were very poor, but yet they had
   been so filled with the Grace of God that their very poverty had
   enabled them to "abound to the riches of their generosity," for what
   they gave became more in proportion because they were so poor.

   3. For to theirpower, Ibearrecord, yes, and beyond theirpower they were
   willing of themselves. Without any pressure! Without even a
   hint--spontaneously!

   4. Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and
   take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. "Take
   upon us the communion," for that blessed word "Koinonia" communion, is
   applied not only to the Lord's Supper and to such fellowship as that,
   but to communion with poor saints--fellowship with them by helping
   their necessities. And Paul says that the Macedonian Churches pressed
   it upon him that he should take their money and go with it to Jerusalem
   and distribute it. He appears to have been very reluctant to do this,
   but they pressed it upon him.

   5. And this they did, not as we hoped. That is, "according to our
   hopes."

   6. But first gave their own selves to the Lord and unto us by the will
   of God. They first gave of themselves to God and then asked Paul to
   take it that he might use it for God in the distribution of Christian
   charity among the poor saints at Jerusalem.

   6, 7. So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish
   in you the same Grace also. Therefore, as you abound in everything, in
   faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
   love to us, see that you abound in this Grace also. They were a famous
   Church--this Church at Corinth, having gifted men in abundance more
   than other Churches--to the extent that they did not have one man for a
   pastor because they so abounded in brethren able to edify. And he urges
   them, as they were forward in all things, not to be backward in their
   generosity.

   8. I speak not by commandment. "I do not wish to put it upon you as a
   law. I want it to be spontaneous on yourpart."

   8, 9. But by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the
   sincerity of your love. For you know the Grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor,
   that you, through His poverty, might be rich.What a touching argument!
   How could he find a better? Help your Brothers and Sisters in Jerusalem
   that are in need, even though that help should pinch you, for you know
   the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and what He did, and what He gave
   that you might be rich!

   10. Andherein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have
   begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.They
   had begun last year--perhaps not a year ago, but some months ago in the
   previous year--to talk the matter over and to make promises. And they
   had been among the first to undertake the work, but as yet they had not
   done it.

   11. Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
   readiness to will, so there may be a performance, also, out of that
   which you have. They had not a minister, you see, and what is
   everybody's business is nobody's business--and so the contribution was
   not carried out. And in general, the Church at Corinth is about the
   worst in the New Testament, and that for this very reason--that it had
   not any oversight. It is the pattern Church of certain Brothers whom we
   have among us this day--in the very example of them! And they quote
   this as an example, whereas it is put here as a beacon, and a very
   excellent beacon, too, to warn us against any such thing! Everything
   was sixes and sevens, good people as they were. Seeing that they had no
   order and no discipline, nothing got done, and they wearied the
   Apostle's life because of that. God would have things done decently and
   in order--and He gives to His Churches, pastors after His own heart!
   And when He does, then is the Church able to carry out her desires and
   her activities with something like practical common-sense. But here a
   year ago, months ago, they had talked the matter over and made a
   promise--and now Paul has to say to them, "Now, therefore, perform the
   doing of it." They had no deacons to look them up, I will be bound to
   say.

   12-14. For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according
   to that a man has, and not according to that he has not. For I mean not
   that other men be eased and you burdened, but by an equality, that now
   at this time your abundance may be a supply for their need--that their
   abundance may also be a supply for your need--that there may be
   equality It is in the Christian Church, alone, that we shall ever find
   liberty, equality and fraternity thoroughly represented. There, by the
   life of Christ within His people spiritually, that shall be realized,
   and the Apostle backs up this thought of his, which Bengel has
   beautifully put when he says, "We ought to minister of our luxuries to
   the comfort of others, and of our comforts to the necessities of
   others." So we should, to keep up a balance that when one suffers needs
   and another abounds, there may be an equality made.

   15. As it is written, he that had gathered much.Much manna

   15-17. Had nothing left over: and he that had gathered little had no
   lack. But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
   heart of Titus for you. For, indeed, he accepted the exhortation, but
   being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. Or, "he is
   coming to you," for he bore this letter to them.

   18. And we have sent with him the Brother whose praise is in the Gospel
   throughout all the churches: And what Brother was that? Nobody knows.
   And a Brother who has praise in all the Churches may be well content to
   have his name forgotten! Oh, it would be a sweet thing to have praise
   in all the Churches anonymously, so that it all might go up to God. It
   may have been Luke. Probably it was. It may not have been Luke.
   Probably it was not. We do not know who it was. But it is not
   important. What does it matter? As Mr. Whitfield used to say, "Let my
   name perish, but let Christ's name last forever." "And we have sent
   with him the Brother whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the
   churches."

   19. And not that only, but who was also chosen of the Churches to
   travel with us with this Grace, Or "with this gift."

   19, 20. Which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and
   declaration of your ready mind. Avoiding this, that no man should blame
   us in this abundance which is administered by us. He had other brethren
   associated with him lest anybody should even hint that Paul was
   benefited thereby. And, oh, in the distribution of the Lord's money, it
   becomes us to be exceedingly careful! Paul adds this.

   21. Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but
   also in the sight of men. That the thing might be so clear and
   transparent that while God knew that Paul was honest, everybody else
   might know it, too, for others had been associated with him.

   22, 23. And we have sent with them our Brother whom we have oftentimes
   proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent upon the
   great confidence which I have in you. Whether any do enquire of Titus,
   he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brethren be
   enquired of, they are the messengers of the Churches, and the Glory of
   Christ. How beautiful to see Paul so praising his brethren--very
   humble, commonplace persons as compared with himself, but he admires
   the Grace of God in them. How very different from the general spirit of
   depreciation that you find even among Christians--afraid to praise
   anybody lest they should be exalted above measure. You might leave that
   to the devil! He will take care that they are not exalted above measure
   but you need not be as particular about that. Often the best thing that
   can be done for God's servant is to encourage him, for, though you may
   not know it, he may have a multitude of depressions, heavy toil and
   earnest care and much watching which may bring him down. Paul speaks
   well of the Brotherhood--let us try to do the same. But what does he
   call these simple-minded men who are going with him to distribute this
   money? Does he call them the Glory of Christ Yes! Christ is the Glory
   of God and His people are the Glory of Christ! He glories whenever He
   is glorified by them! They are the result of the travail of His soul
   and in that sense they are His Glory.

The Heavenly Rainbow

   (No. 3412)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And there was a rainbow around about the Throne, in sight like unto an
   emerald." Revelation 4:3.

   "A RAINBOW!" "A rainbow around about the Throne!" I have a notion
   concerning this rainbow, that it was a complete circle. In the 10th
   Chapter the Apostle tells us that he saw "another mighty angel with a
   rainbow upon his head," which could hardly have been the semi-circular
   arc we are accustomed to see in the sky in times of rain and sunshine.
   It must have been, I should imagine, a complete ring.

   I stood, two years ago, on a little wooden bridge in the village of
   Handeck on the Swiss side of the Grimsel Pass, and looked down upon the
   roaring torrent beneath. The waterfall, breaking itself upon enormous
   rocks, cast up showers of foam and spray. As I looked down, the sun
   shone upon it and I saw a rainbow such as I had never seen but once
   before in another place upon a similar occasion. It was a complete
   circle around the fall, then another one and within it a third-- three
   wheels within wheels, consisting of all the delightful colors of the
   rainbow, from the timid violet up to the courageous red! There was no
   mistake about it. They were complete rings that seemed to go right
   round the torrent, like great belts of sapphires, emeralds and
   chalcedonies. The ring was trebled as it shone before me. I stood and
   wondered at the sight. Then these very texts came to my mind, "a
   rainbow around about the Throne," and, "I saw a mighty angel, who had a
   rainbow upon his head."

   It seems to me that John had such a sight before him--a rainbow which
   entirely surrounded the Throne of God. If it is so, I shall not, I
   think, be accounted fanciful if I draw a moral. In this world we only
   see, for it is all we can see, one-half of the Eternal Covenant of
   God's Grace. That one upward arch of Divine masonry is all that we see
   here. The other downward half, on which the one which we see rests,
   namely, the eternal decree, the purpose, the resolve of Infinite
   Sovereignty--that is out of sight as yet. We cannot discern it. Earth
   comes between the horizon and bounds it. But when we shall get up
   yonder and see things as they are, and know even as we are known, then
   the Covenant will be seen by us to be a complete circle, an harmonious
   whole--not a broken thing, not a broken arc, or a semi-circle, as it
   seems to be now-- but, like Deity itself, perpetual, everlasting,
   complete, perfect, eternal! It may be true to the figure--it certainly
   will be so in fact. What we know not now, we shall know hereafter and
   possibly this very emblem is here used to set forth to us that while we
   see the Glory which God has made manifest, we do not and cannot, at
   present, see the eternal purpose itself, except as far as we judge of
   it from its grand results. Oh, it is delightful to think of going up
   yonder if for nothing else than knowing more of Christ, understanding
   more of Divine Love, drinking deeper into the mystery of godliness
   through which God was manifest in the flesh! Surely, if we know but
   little, that little knowledge has set us thirsting for deeper draughts
   and we are waiting for the time when we shall drop the veil which parts
   us from spiritual realities and shall see them face to face, needing no
   longer to view them as in a glass, reflected darkly!

   I want you to notice three things which these words suggest, "There was
   a rainbow around about the Throne." First--Divine Sovereignty never
   oversteps the bounds of the Covenant, but is rainbow-hedged with a wall
   of fire around about the Throne. In the second place--Divine Government
   springing from Sovereignty--the Throne of God is always regulated by
   the Covenant--there is respect at all times to the Covenant of Grace in
   everything that Jehovah does. Thirdly--in the Covenant of Grace the
   predominant quality is Grace--"it was in sight like unto an emerald, "
   which I will further explain indicates that loving kindness and tender
   mercy towards men always shine radiant in the Covenant. First, then,
   "there was a rainbow around about the Throne."

   I. DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY NEVER OVERSTEPS THE BOUNDS OF THE COVENANT.

   "There was a rainbow around about the Throne"--as though the rainbow
   hedged the Throne of God--belted it, girt it round about. God's
   Sovereignty must, of necessity, be absolute and unlimited. He made
   everything and as nothing existed before God, or independent of God, He
   had a right to make what He pleased and to make all that He did make
   after His own will and pleasure. And when He has made, His rights do
   not terminate, but He still continues to have an altogether unlimited
   and absolute power over the creatures of His hands. He claims the right
   for Himself. "Has not the potter power over the clay to make of the
   same lump one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?" God has the
   power to create and the power, afterwards, to use that which is created
   for the purpose for which He has made it. "Shall I not do what I will
   with My own?" is a question which the Almighty may well ask of all His
   creatures who would dare to bring Him to their bar and blasphemously
   rejudge His judgment, snatch from His hands the balance and the rod and
   seek to set themselves up as censors of the Holy One! Whenever men say,
   "How can God do this?" and, "How shall He do that?" it should always
   content us to answer, "No, O man, but who are you that replies against
   God?" for whether we will have it or not, still God has said it and He
   will stand to it. "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
   will have compassion on whom I will have compassion"--so then, it is
   not of him that wills nor of him that runs, but of God that shows
   mercy!

   But as one Truth of God is always to be taken in its relation to
   another Truth and not to be isolated from its natural kindred, it is a
   delightful consideration that God, in His absolute Sovereignty, never
   does violence to any of His other attributes and, above all, never does
   violence to the Covenant The Covenant still surrounds the Sovereignty
   and practically hedges it within its bounds!

   God is practically, as far as we are concerned, bound by His own
   Revelation of His own Character. He has been pleased to tell us that He
   is just and that He is the Lord God, merciful and gracious. In a few
   words, He has given us the sum of Himself by saying that, "God is
   Love." When a man says concerning himself, "I have a right to do as I
   like, but I am generous as well as just," you feel sure he will
   exercise the right which he claims in a manner according to and
   consistent with his own statement of what he is. And if he has rightly
   estimated his own character, he will give bountifully and pay
   honorably. Rest assured, then, that God's Sovereignty never will prove
   Him to have misrepresented Himself, or to have deceived us! When He
   says that He is just, He neither can nor will act unjustly towards any
   creature He has made. There was never a pang or a pain inflicted
   arbitrarily by God. God never pronounced a curse upon any man unless
   that man had clearly and richly earned it by his sin! No soul was ever
   cast into Hell by God's Sovereignty. God takes counsel with Himself,
   but He stoops not to caprice. How comes the hapless creature, then, to
   this dread torment? Sin brings the sinner into a ruined
   state--yustiepronounces the sinner's doom. Sovereignty may let that
   doom stand. What if it moves not to avert the issue? Justice it is that
   pronounces the curse. Be assured, Man, however much you may kick
   against the Doctrine of Election, you have no reason to do so! Whatever
   that Doctrine may involve, it is not possible but that God must and
   will act towards you in a way so strictly just that when you, yourself,
   come to discover it in eternity, you will not be able to complain, but
   be compelled to stand speechless!

   Moreover, God has been pleased to assure you that He is Love--that He
   is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Now,
   whatever Sovereignty may decree, you may rest assured that the decree
   will be in consonance with the fact that God is full of mercy, grace
   and truth. I know some of you set up the decree of God like a huge
   monster before you. You paint a horrible picture, as though the visage
   of Him that speaks to you from Heaven were cruel and pitiless. But that
   picture is drawn by your perverse imagination--it is not God's portrait
   of Himself, for He says, "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no
   pleasure in the death of him that dies, but had rather that he would
   turn unto Me and live." God mocks not when He says, "Turn you, turn
   you; why will you die, O house of Israel?" That is honest emotion which
   God feels over a sinner who ruins himself when He cries, "How can I
   give you up? How shall I set you as Admah? How shall I make you as
   Zeboim? My heart is moved; My repentings are kindled together!" God
   wills not the death of a sinner, but had rather that he should turn
   unto Him and live! So He, Himself, assures us and, Sovereign as He is,
   yet He still remains both just and gracious forever--and let us not
   doubt it for a moment! The rainbow, the rainbow of His own glorious
   attributes of mercy always surrounds the Throne of God!

   It is equally certain, taking another view of this subject, that God's
   Sovereignty never can by any possibility run counter to thepromise
   which He Himself has made. God has a right to do as He wills with His
   own, but when He once, in His Sovereignty, chooses to make a promise,
   He would be unfaithful if He did not keep it--and it is not possible
   that Hecan be unfaithful, for none of His Words ever did fail, or ever
   shall! He has been true to the very jots and tittles of all that He
   has, Himself, declared. Never in any case has any man been able to say
   that God has spoken in secret, and said to the seed of Jacob, "Seek you
   My face," in vain. I want every unconverted person here to be careful
   to note this Truth of God. Whenever you find a promise in God's Word,
   do not let the thought of Predestination scare you from it.
   Predestination can never be contrary to the promise! It is not in
   Election, or Reprobation, or in any Doctrine that asserts Divine
   Sovereignty to make the promise of God to be of no effect! Take a
   promise like this--"He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved."
   If you believe, and if you are baptized, you have, then, God's Word for
   it--you shall be saved! Be sure of it-- that stands fast! Heaven and
   earth may pass away, but that Word shall not fail you. God will keep
   His Word of Truth with you and at the Last Tremendous Day you shall
   find that since you believe, God will save you!

   Take another--"Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
   Then, if you call upon the name of the Lord--that is if with hearty,
   earnest prayer, you cry to God and if with your whole soul you take Him
   to be your All-in-All, calling upon His name as the heathens do upon
   their gods when they avow themselves to be their followers--if you do
   this, you shall be saved! Now, I beseech you, remember that no decree
   can possibly run counter to this. You say, "What if the decree shall
   destroy me?" Man, His promise is the decree! The promise of God is His
   eternal purpose, written out in black and white for you to read. So far
   from the counsel of eternity being contrary to the Revelation in time,
   the revelation in time is nothing more than a transcript of what God
   resolved to do from before the foundation of the world! Take any
   promise you will. Let it be this, if the others seem to miss you--"Come
   now, let us reason together; though your sins are as scarlet, they
   shall be as wool." Now, your sins are as scarlet, and you are willing
   to come and reason with God and you find that when He reasons with you,
   He tells you that you must rest in the blood of Jesus, leave your sins
   and depend wholly upon Christ. Well, now, after you have done, you have
   God's Word for it that those scarlet sins of yours shall be "whiter
   than snow." Well then, they must be so! It is not possible that
   anything unknown to you should come in and make void the promise which
   is known. I will read that verse I just mentioned again, "He has never
   spoken in secret, and said to the seed of Jacob, Seek you My face in
   vain." God has not said behind your back what He has not said to your
   face! He has said, "Come unto Me, and I will give you rest." He has
   said, "Oh, you thirsty, come and drink." He has said, "Whoever will,
   let him come and take of the Water of Life freely." There is nothing in
   that mysterious roll, which no human eye has ever seen, that can be in
   conflict with the golden promises which gleam in the Book of God's Word
   upon every needy sinner that comes and trusts in the Lord! There is a
   rainbow around about the Throne. Sovereignty never gets out of the
   circle of the promise.

   Oh, child of God! Your heavenly Father, in His Sovereignty, has a right
   to do with you, His child, as He pleases, but He will never let that
   Sovereignty get out of the limit of the Covenant! As a Sovereign, He
   might cast you away, but He has promised that He never will--and He
   never will! As a Sovereign, He might leave you to perish, but He has
   said, "I will not leave you nor forsake you." As a Sovereign, He might
   suffer you to be tempted beyond your strength, but He has promised that
   no temptation shall happen to you, but such as is common to man, and He
   will, with the temptation, make a way of escape! Let no dark thought
   ever cross your mind that, perhaps, towards you He will deal
   arbitrarily. It is not so. He will carry out His purpose to you--and of
   that purpose He has already informed you by telling you that you are
   His, His adopted child and you shall be His forever and ever! In the
   second place--

   II. THE RULING GOVERNMENT OF GOD IN THE WORLD ALWAYS HAS RESPECT TO THE
   COVENANT OF GRACE.

   It is so in great things. He set the bounds of the nations according to
   the number of the children of Israel. When you read God's Word, Egypt
   comes upon the stage--Assyria, Babylon, Greece and Rome. Yet what are
   they but a sort of background? They come and they go, for all their
   secular grandeur, as mere accessories. The central figure is always the
   Election of Grace--the people of God--for the rest, they are merely the
   plowmen and the vinedressers for the Lord's own people. Sometimes these
   nations are nursing fathers. At other times they are sharp rods.
   Whichever they may be, they are mere instruments. The Bible speaks of
   them as so much scaffolding for the building of the living temple in
   which the mercy of God shall be displayed! Whenever you read, or hear
   people talk about prophecy, you may depend upon it that Inspiration has
   not been given to tell of Louis Napoleon, or any other earthly
   Sovereign. It is not the history of Prussia, Russia, or France that the
   heavenly Apocalypse unveils. The whole Book is written for His
   people--it gives us the history of the Church--but it does not give us
   the history of anything else! The way to read the Book, if you do read
   it, is with this central thought in your minds--that God has not
   revealed to us anything concerning Assyria, Babylon, Greece, or Rome
   for their own sakes--but He has referred to them because they happen to
   have a connection with the history of His Church. That is all, for He
   has chosen Jacob to Himself and Israel to be His peculiar treasure. My
   Brothers and Sisters, I believe that when kings and potentates meet in
   the cabinet chamber and consult together according to their ambition, a
   Counselor whom they never see pulls the strings and they are only His
   puppets. And even when armies meet in battle array, when the world
   seems shaken to and fro with revolutions and the most stable thrones
   quiver as though they were but vessels out at sea, there is a secret
   Force working in all. The end and drift of these momentous actions is
   the bringing out of the chosen race--the salvation of the blood-bought
   company and the glory of God in the redeeming of the world unto
   Himself! When you read the newspaper, read it to see how your heavenly
   Father is managing the world for the good of His own children! All
   else--be it the disposal of a throne, the settlement of a political
   question, or the winning of a boat race--all else, I say, are minor
   things compared with the interests of the Election of Grace! All things
   are revolving and cooperating for good. They are working together for
   good to them that love God, and are the called according to the purpose
   of His Grace. By them He will make manifest throughout the ages unto
   the angels and the principalities, His manifold wisdom!

   Now, as this is the case in the great, it is equally so in the little.
   In all your smaller affairs, God always governs with respect to the
   Covenant. Your worst afflictions are still meant for your good, for
   this is one clause in the Covenant, "Surely in blessing, I will bless."
   When you come to the worst, even should that happen to be at the close
   of life, you will find that God has still kept within Covenant
   engagements. Hear what David said upon his bed of pain, "Although my
   house is not so with God, yet"--oh, gracious, "yet"!--"yet has He made
   with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure." You
   have lost your property--it is a sad thing for you to come down in the
   world, but this always was in the Covenant. Have you never read it? "In
   the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have
   overcome the world." Lately, when you have been in prayer, you have had
   but little comfort--and when you have read the Word of God, it has not
   seemed to gleam with delight to you, but rather the Book has seemed
   dark. Well, well, that is in the Covenant! Did I not read it to you?
   "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and
   repent." Perhaps you have been backsliding. It is sad that it should be
   so. And now you have lost much of your enjoyment and you are
   exceedingly cast down. But did you ever read it, "The backslider in
   heart shall be filled with his own ways"? Do you not know it to be a
   promise from God--"If his children err from My commandments, then will
   I visit their transgressions with the rod; nevertheless, My Covenant
   will I not take away from him, nor suffer My loving kindness to fail"?
   You are only receiving, now, what God has promised to give to you!

   Look upon these things as tokens that God is faithful. We are told in
   the Covenant God made with Noah, that "seedtime and harvest, summer and
   winter shall never cease." Now, the snow has fallen today, and it is
   bitterly cold. But, my Brothers and Sisters, it was in the Covenant
   that the winter should not cease. No doubt when the harvest comes, and
   the summer laughs with joy, we shall say, "How good God is and how true
   He has been to His Covenant, that there should be a harvest and a
   summer!" Ah, but when the seed is cast into the cold soil and the frost
   covers it, you ought to be equally grateful to the faithfulness of God,
   for this, too, is one part of the promise! If He did not keep one part,
   you might be afraid that He would not keep the other! Just so is it
   spiritually. Your troubles are promised to you. "In the world you shall
   have tribulation." You have got your troubles. "As many as He loves, He
   chastens." You have got the chastening. Be, therefore, thankful that
   you have another proof of the Divine Faithfulness towards you. There is
   a rainbow around about the Throne of God, and let the Throne decree
   what it may! The scepter is never stretched beyond the boundary of
   Covenant Love. It is impossible for God to deal towards His people
   contrary to the spirit which breathes in the two Immutable things in
   which it is impossible for Him to lie, and by which He has given strong
   consolation to those who have fled for refuge to the hope which is set
   before them in the Gospel . Our third point is--

   III. IN THE COVENANT OF GRACE, REPRESENTED BY THE CIRCULAR RAINBOW,
   LOVE AND GRACE

   ARE ALWAYS CONSPICUOUS.

   The emerald, with its green color, is always taken to represent this
   green earth and the things which concern the dwellers therein. And it
   has always been viewed as a type of mercy. It is a soft and gentle
   color, the most agreeable to the eyes of all the colors, the vibrations
   of light caused by it being found to be more suitable to the optic
   nerve than the vibrations of any other color. Scarlet and such bright
   colors, the emblems of justice and vengeance, would soon destroy
   theeyes. White, the emblem of purity, cannot long be endured. Those of
   us who have crossed lofty mountains covered with snow have had to
   suffer as long as we have been there, from snow-blindness. The human
   eyes would soon cease to perform its functions if the earth were long
   covered with snow and if we had nothing to relieve the eyes. Green is
   the color that suits mankind and it represents the mercy, the
   tenderness and the benevolence of God towards mankind.

   Whenever you read the Covenant, read it in the light of the emerald. I
   have sometimes thought that some of my Brothers and Sisters read it in
   another light. I think I have heard prayers which, if translated into
   plain English, would run something like this--"Lord, we thank You that
   we are elected. We bless You that we are in the Covenant. We bless Your
   name that You are sending sinners down to Hell, cutting them off and
   destroying them, but we are saved!" I have sometimes thought I have
   caught in such prayers an air of complacency in the damnation of
   sinners, and even a little more than that--I have fancied I have seen
   in certain hyper-Calvinists a sort of Red Indian scalping knife
   propensity-- an ogre-like feeling with respect to reprobation--a
   smacking of lips over the ruin and destruction of mankind! As to all of
   which, I can only say that it seems to me to be "earthly, sensual,
   devilish." I cannot imagine a man, especially a man who has the spirit
   of Christ in him, thinking of the ruin of mankind with any other
   feeling than that which moved the soul of Christ when He wept over
   Jerusalem, crying, "How often would I have gathered you as a hen
   gathers her chicks under her wings!" Let no one imagine that the spirit
   of Calvinism is a spirit of hostility to universal humanity! It is not
   so! It is a perversion and a caricature of the expositions of Calvin
   and Augustine--and of the Apostle Paul and of what our Master
   preached--to represent us as thinking with complacency of the ruin of
   any one of the human race!

   My Brothers and Sisters, when I have sometimes heard statements made
   about the fewness of those who will be saved at the last, I have
   thought that surely the rainbow around about the Throne of the God whom
   such people worshipped must have been scarlet in color. It could not
   have been "in sight like unto an emerald." There must have been a
   predominance of vengeance in it and not of mercy! Why, I firmly believe
   that at the last it will be found that there are more in Heaven than in
   Hell, for when the great winding up of the drama shall come, Christ
   will in all things have the preeminence! Now, alas, there are few that
   find the narrow road while broad is the gate of Hell and many there are
   that go in that way. We are in the minority, now, but when I think of
   the countless hosts of little children, elect of God, who have gone
   from their mother's breasts to Glory, not having passed through actual
   sin, but being bought with precious blood, I can see a vast multitude
   that belongs to Christ! And when I look forward to that brighter age
   when the nations shall flock to the feet of Christ, and tens of
   thousands and hundreds of millions shall sing His praises from the
   rising of the sun to the going down of the same, I rejoice to think
   that then the Lord Jesus Christ will see of the travail of His soul and
   will be satisfied--and it is not a little that will satisfy Him! I have
   sometimes thought with a certain good Divine, that when the King comes
   to end His reign, there will be found no more in prison in comparison
   with the great number of His creatures, than in any well ordered
   government. At any rate, let us hope so. We have no right to speak
   positively where we have no positive declaration. But it is significant
   that there is always a prominence given in Scripture to the grace, the
   mercy, the goodness and the loving kindness of God. Surely Scripture
   would not tell us this unless it would also seem to be so in the
   universal Providence of God. I believe that in the rainbow, the emerald
   will be the most conspicuous, and that Divine Grace will be "in Heaven
   the topmost stone," for it "well deserves the praise." And now, in
   conclusion, my dear Friends--

   IV. LET ME MAKE ONE OR TWO PRACTICAL REMARKS.

   Let me exhort you all to understand the Covenant, of which the rainbow
   is the symbol. I am sorry to say that there are many professors who do
   not know what the Covenant means. I have been told that there are
   pulpits where the word, "Covenant," is scarcely ever mentioned, so that
   the congregation really do not know what the Covenant of Grace means.
   Now, the old Scotch Divines and our own Puritan forefathers were of
   opinion that the two Covenants are the very essence of all theology.
   When a man gets a clear view of the Covenant of Works and sees how it
   was made with Adam, and broken, and how it involved our ruin--and then
   gets a clear view of the Covenant of Grace made with the Second Adam,
   the conditions of which are all fulfilled by Him, so that the Covenant
   cannot be broken by us--and that all the provisions of that Covenant
   are made sure by His having fulfilled His Suretyship and Sponsorship on
   our behalf. When a man gets a hold of these two things, why, he cannot
   be an Arminian. It is impossible! But he must keep pretty near to those
   grand old Doctrines which we call the Doctrines of Grace. If any man
   says to me, "What is the one thing which I have to learn to be a sound
   preacher of the Gospel?" I think I would say, "Learn to distinguish
   between the Covenant of Hagar, which is Sinai in Arabia, and the
   Covenant of Sarah, which is the Covenant of the New Jerusalem, which is
   of promise. The distinction between works and Grace, between debt and
   gift, between the works of the Law and the abounding loving kindness of
   the Lord our Lord." May I ask young members of the Church to read the
   Scriptures upon this point and to ask their older friends to instruct
   them in the matter of the Covenant? It is such an important point that
   I would press it very earnestly. I hope you do not wish to go to Heaven
   like those of whom the Savior speaks, and who enter into life lame, or
   maimed, or having but one eye. Oh, no, but seek to clear away
   ignorance! That the soul is without knowledge is not good. Get a clear
   view of these things, for by so doing you will be comforted, you will
   be strengthened, you will be sanctified!

   But if you do understand the Covenant, have a constant regard to it.
   There is a sweet prayer, "Have respect unto Your Covenant." We pray
   that to God. Well, He does have respect to the Covenant. He has the
   symbol of it all around His Throne! He cannot look anywhere without
   looking through His Covenant. He sees us, He sees the world, He sees
   all things through that rainbow which is around His Throne. He sees all
   human affairs through the medium of the great Mediator, the Covenant
   Angel, the Lord Jesus. Well now, what you ask God to do, and what He
   does, do for yourselves! Have respect unto the Covenant. Do you ever
   think of the Covenant? Some, I am afraid, do not think of it by the
   month together and yet the Covenant--oh, Brothers and Sisters--it is a
   casket full of wealth! It is a fountain full of crystal streams! It is
   the Heaven out of which the manna falls! It is the Rock out of which
   the living waters flow--the Rock, Christ, who is the essence of the
   Covenant to us! Live upon the Covenant in life and let it claim your
   last accents in the moment of death! Rejoice in this Covenant of Grace
   all day! Live upon the choice morsels which God has laid up in store
   for you in it. The Covenant! The Covenant! Oh, keep your hearts, keep
   your thoughts, keep your eyes constantly on it!

   And oh, get comfort from the Covenant! Do not merely think of it, but
   really lay hold upon it. You are in covenant with God! It is not a
   question with you, as a believer in Christ, whether God may keep you
   and bless you and cause His face to shine upon you. He will do so! He
   cannot do otherwise, if I may use such language concerning Him, because
   though He is free, yet He has bound Himself by His promise! He has
   bound Himself by His oath! He has put Himself within the limit of the
   rainbow and out of that He cannot, and will not go! It encircles His
   Throne and Himself. You may go up to His Throne humbly but still go
   there with boldness. You do not come like a common beggar. You do not
   knock at the door as a man does at your door, a chance beggar asking
   for charity. You have got a promise! Come, then, as a man goes into the
   bank who has got a bank-bill that is dated and now the day is come for
   it to be paid! Go to God, making mention of the name of Jesus, with the
   humble boldness with which a child asks of its own loving parent what
   that parent has often promised to bestow. Let the comfort of the
   Covenant be continually yours!

   And if you have this comfort, never, never be so base as to indulge
   hard thoughts of God. It is very easy for me to say this to you, but it
   will not always be so easy for you to practice it. Ah, Friends, we
   think we can take God's will and be submissive to it and acquiesce in
   it--but when it presses hard upon us--then is the proof. When a man
   gets into the fining-pot and the crucible is put into the fire, they
   will show what faith he has! Ah, it is hard when you get a heavy
   stroke, when you are told that such-and-such an one who is very dear to
   you will die before long, or when you know that you, yourself, have a
   fatal disease--it is then hard to say, "The Lord lives, and blessed be
   my Rock!" Or, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, and blessed
   be His name." It was admirable in David, that when he began one of his
   mournful Psalms, he knew that he was going to groan a good deal, so he
   said, "There is one matter we will set right before we get out of trim.
   Truly God is good to Israel." That is settled. He puts that down as the
   first thing when he gets into the box as a witness. He says, "I am
   confused, today, and tumbled up and down in my wits, but before I say
   anything, I have to say this one thing--I solemnly declare before men,
   angels and devils--God is truly good to Israel! As for me, my feet had
   well-nigh gone, my steps had almost slipped," and so on--but he begins
   with that. Now, settle that, settle that in your soul! Put that down
   like an anchor, right deep in the sea--come winds, come waves, come
   hurricanes--God is good! God is faithful! God will keep His Covenant!
   Every dark and painful line meets in the center of His Love. It must be
   right. Never let your soul be envious of the wicked when you see their
   prosperity, but still rejoice in your God and let Him do as He wills!

   If you do know anything about the sweetness of the Covenant, when you
   meet with a poor child of the house of Israel, tell him about it. And
   as you do not know who he may be, tell everybody about it! There may be
   one of your Brothers or Sisters with whom you are to live in Heaven
   sitting next to you in the pew. Since I mentioned last Sundaynight that
   there was a young person who had been here for two years and nobody had
   ever spoken to her, I have had a letter from a young man to say that he
   is in the same case. Oh, dear! You know how I told you on Sunday night
   that I was ashamed of some of you, but I did not know in which part of
   the chapel you were and, therefore, as I did not know who it was, I
   could not be ashamed of you, but get you to be ashamed on your own
   account! Now, you see, there are two cases, and I am afraid if we get
   more testimony, it would go to ever so many places in the Tabernacle.
   Do not let it be so! Let each one pluck up heart and say unto his
   fellow, "Know the Lord." Let each man say to his neighbor, "Have you
   tasted the sweetness?" Who finds honey and eats it all? You ought to
   say, like the Syrian lepers, "This is a day of good tidings; if we
   tarry here, perhaps mischief will befall us; let us go even into the
   camp of Israel and let us tell them of this thing." Spread abroad the
   good news! Who knows how many you may bring to my Master's footstool,
   to their salvation and to your own comfort and joy?

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 18:21-24; 19:1-10.

   Blessed is he that reads and understands the prophecy of this Book. We
   have no difficulty in knowing to what city this great Babylon refers,
   for the Church of Rome, in the plenitude of its wisdom, has taken the
   title to itself in attempting to claim that Peter was the first bishop
   of Rome! They quote the text, "The church that is in Babylon salutes
   you"-- that church, they say, being the church in Rome! Therefore Rome
   is Babylon! Besides, the whole of the 18th Chapter gives such a
   description as can only apply to her and she must, and shall, come to
   her end!

   Verses 21-24. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great
   millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall
   that great city, Babylon, be thrown down and shall be found no more at
   all And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and
   trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsmen of
   whatever craft he is, shall be found anymore in you; and the sound of a
   millstone shall be heard no more at all in you, And the light of a
   candle shall shine no more at all in you. And the voice of the
   bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for
   your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorceries
   were allnations deceived. Andin her was found the blood of Prophets,
   and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth

   REVELATION 19:1-10.

   Verses 1-4. And after these things I heard a great voice of much people
   in Heaven, praying, Alleluia, Salvation, and glory, andhonor, andpower,
   unto the Lord our God: For true andrighteous are His judgments: for He
   hasjudged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her
   fornication, and has avenged the blood of His servants at her hands.
   And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up forever and ever
   And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
   worshiped God that sat on the Throne, saying, Amen: Alleluia. For the
   overthrow of a monstrous system of error gives delight to all holy
   spirits--and chiefly to those who stand nearest the eternal Throne of
   God!

   5-6. And a voice came out of the Throne saying, Praise our God, all you
   His servants, and you that fear Him, both small and great And I heard,
   as it were, the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many
   waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders saying, Alleluia: for the
   Lord God Omnipotent reigns! The harlot church is put away! The true
   Church is introduced, fully arrayed in perfect holiness, ready for the
   consummation of her own joy and her master's--her last delight.

   7-10. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to Him: for the
   marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready. And
   to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
   white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he said
   unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage
   supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true sayings of
   God. And I feel at his feet to worship him, and he said unto me, See
   you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren that have
   the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the
   spirit of prophecy. If John made a mistake, because the saints in
   Heaven are all so like their Master, it is well that the mistake was at
   once corrected, for angel worship, or the worship of saints, is to be
   avoided by all saints! And God's Word about it is, "See you do it not."
   It is said that we should certainly pay reverence to holy men that are
   now with God, but see you do it not! Indeed, here among men, the same
   kind of idolatry is sought to be kept up, and the preacher is arrayed
   in garments to make him distinct from the people, as though he were
   something better or different from them and not their fellow servant!
   But, for all this, let us hear the voice which says, "See you do it
   not. I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren that have the
   testimony of Jesus." Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the
   spirit of prophecy.

God's Mercy Going Before

   (No. 3413)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY10,1870.

   "The God of my mercy shall prevent [go before] me." Psalm 59:10.

   IF you read this Psalm, you will find that David was in a very grievous
   plight. He was surrounded by the most cruel and the most false of men.
   They were ravening like wolves over carrion and endeavoring to destroy
   his character--and even to take his life. David knew where his resort
   was. As the conies make their dwellings in the rocks, and as the
   swallows have built a nest for themselves at God's altar, so David
   resorted to his God, and to his God alone.

   All the skin bottles may be dry, but there is water in the well. And
   all creature comforts may fail but there is an all-sufficiency in an
   unfailing God. If all is false to you, God will be true! And if all
   hate you, God is Love--and if you are in Him, He cannot be angry with
   you, nor rebuke you--love towards you, and love only, shall rule the
   day!

   Let me persuade every child of God here in the hour of his trouble to
   resort to the comfort which David found so availing. Away, as a bird to
   the mountain--away, away to your God! If you have Rabshekeh's letter
   about you, go and spread it before the Lord. If you have, today, an
   inward sorrow that you cannot tell into any other ear, go, like Hannah,
   and stand before God, and there let your soul pour out its bitterness.
   You shall find that in consulting human sympathy, there is some
   gain--often very little--but in seeking the sympathy of your great High
   Priest above, there is much gain and there never can be failure. When
   David returned to Ziklag, he found it burned and his wives carried away
   captive. He and his men had lost all their property and all their
   families. His men spoke of stoning him, but it is written, "David
   encouraged himself in his God."

   Now, if you have come to something like the same plight. If your
   affairs are at the lowest ebb and there is the sharpest winter passing
   over all your prospects, now turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of
   hope! Trust in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him. Be of good
   courage, for He shall strengthen your heart. If we learn only that
   lesson--and do but put it into practice throughout our life--we shall
   have a good reward for coming up to the assembly of God's people
   tonight.

   But now, a few words upon this text of David's. He declares that the
   God of his mercy would go before him, or forestall him. The word
   "prevent," when it was used by our translators, did not mean at all
   what it does now. It means here that God would provide, would
   forestall, would be beforehand in loving kindness with him--and the two
   points we will speak of tonight are these--it has been so. It shall be
   so. First--

   I. IT HAS BEEN SO.

   The God of our mercy has gone before us and outrun us. It has been so
   in the salvation of all His people. Long before time had begun, God had
   foreknown His chosen, and foreordained them unto eternal life. They had
   not chosen Him, for they were not in existence! He chose them as He saw
   them in the glass of His decrees. It must always be that God goes
   before or outruns His people, since from before the foundation of the
   world He had loved them--loved them with an everlasting love. There can
   be nothing before this. We know of nothing that can stand side by side
   with it, so far as we are concerned, for we had no being, except in the
   purpose of God. But even then He loved us. He loved us when we were
   dead in sins, when we had not a heart with which to love Him, when we
   were rejecting Him altogether and did evil even as we could--yet He
   loved us notwithstanding all. It must always be true if we think of the
   Doctrine of Election that He went before us with His mercy!

   It was so also, with redemption. Where were we when Christ redeemed us?
   My Brothers and Sisters, our sins were laid on Christ, but they were
   not then committed. Our transgressions were then taken by Him, but we
   had not even perpetrated them then! We were not yet living and yet a
   Savior was provided for us before we were, by any actual sin,
   personally lost. A fountain filled with blood was provided for us
   before we had, by any actual guilt, become defiled. Oh, here was Divine
   forethought--here was a precious going before, of God's goodness! How
   He must have loved us, that knowing what our needs would be, foreseeing
   the abundance of our sins, He laid by in store the Divine Atonement,
   the sacred Propitiation by which all our sins should be put away. This
   was another going before of His mercy!

   Indeed, Brothers and Sisters, if you think of it, the whole Gospelis a
   going before of us. There was that Book written exactly to meet your
   case and mine, when as yet our case was not in existence. Here was a
   Covenant "ordered in all things and sure" and made for us in the Person
   of Christ. We were not parties to it, for as yet had not any being.
   Here was mercy laid by in the Covenant, everything that our necessities
   could require! Grace for Grace supplies for all the needs of our
   nature, treasured up for the poor mendicants before we ever became
   beggars, or knew that we were in need!

   Think of the fullness that there is in Jesus Christ, and all these
   1,800 years ago in matter of fact, and there from the foundation of the
   world in the Divine Purpose for every elect soul, though many of them
   would not come into being until remote centuries had flown by! All this
   forestalled, and the giving of the Holy Spirit, too, by which the
   saints are now called unto repentance, and unto a new life and all the
   operations and influences of the Holy Spirit which are all provided for
   in the Covenant of Grace--all bestowed upon the saints as one by one,
   they come into life, but all provided for long before they were born!
   My God, your goings forth were of old, from everlasting, and all your
   goings forth were full of love to me, and to all them that love You!
   How marvelous are You in Your condescending Grace! Where shall I find
   words with which to adore You? How shall I sufficiently give you the
   gratitude of my heart in outward expression for this, Your ancient,
   Your everlasting love towards those whom you have chosen? Bless His
   name, oh, you His people! Live to His praise and love Him all day long!

   But this Truth of God met with a further illustration in our experience
   at the time of our conversion and before it Observe the preventing
   goodness or God with many of us before conversion. We might have
   committed the unpardonable sin, but we were always kept from that--how,
   we may not know, and probably never shall until we are in Heaven. We
   might have put ourselves into positions where instrumentalities which
   were blessed to us might never have reached us. We have sometimes been
   on the verge of committing sins which might have led us in a downward
   career of vice, farther and farther, and might even have led us to
   destroy ourselves! Speaking after the manner of men, our soul has run
   innumerable risks, each one of which could have led to eternal
   destruction from the Presence of the Lord, had it not been that going
   before mercy was beforehand with us and would not let us commit the
   fatal act which would have consigned us to everlasting perdition! Many
   and many a time has He held back His servants when they were just on
   the edge of the fatal precipice, when they were about to take the
   deadly poison which would have eternally destroyed their souls! His
   mercy, in some Providence which they did not understand, has
   interposed. And you who are here tonight, you have been sick lately.
   Well, that sickness has kept you out of a sin into which you were
   beginning to slide. You have lately been overtaken with a very terrible
   loss. Yes, but your soul was getting eaten up with covetousness, and if
   it had not been for that loss, you had not been here tonight--you would
   have been still seeking after the world with both your hands--and you
   would not have had an ear for anything like a message from the Throne
   of God! It may be a part of the joy of Heaven to be permitted to see
   the manifold wisdom of God in His dealing with us even before we were
   quickened by His Spirit. There are marvelous preparations, I do not
   doubt, which are going on in human hearts for the more effectual work
   of Grace, for there are many who are not converted, but whose case is
   very hopeful. They are like what our Lord called "honest and good
   ground," ready for the living Seed. Holy teachings at home, Godly
   examples, works within the mind that have tended to elevate the taste
   and purify the morals--and a thousand other things may come in as a
   sort of preparation for the true work of Divine Grace--and in looking
   back, while we must, first of all, see the preventing Grace of God in
   keeping us back from sin, we can next see it in gently leading us,
   though we knew Him not, as He did Israel of old, taking us by the arms
   and teaching us to go, sweetly inclining us, gently drawing us until
   the time should come when He should pass by us and say unto us, "Live."
   All the history of an elect child of God, even before conversion, will
   be found to be full of traces of the going before goodness of the Lord.

   But probably we noticed this most at the time of our conversion. Some
   of us recollect when we first began to sigh and cry after a Savior, but
   oh, how He then went before us with His mercy! The sermon that we heard
   seemed exactly to suit our case, though the minister knew nothing of
   us. And when we turned to the Word of God, there were texts there, some
   of them very terrible ones, and they did for us just exactly what ought
   to have been done--they helped in the cutting and tearing process that
   was necessary before the pierced hands should come and bind up our
   wounds! God's mercy in going before us helped us to the tenderness of
   heart that we were seeking after, helped us to the repentance that we
   longed to feel, helped us to the contrition which we desired to
   experience. It helped us, in fact, to have done with self, and to begin
   with Him! It helped us to see the depravity of our hearts as soon as
   ever we began to desire to see it and to be humbled on account of it.

   But do you not remember when those desires began to assume the form of
   prayer--when you got some light as to the way of salvation and desired
   how to close in with Christ and to trust Him? How swiftly did the
   Divine Father then run to meet His prodigal child! Oh, happy day when
   He fell upon our neck and kissed us, when He took off our rags and put
   on the raiment of joy, and bade the music and dancing go on in the
   house because the lost one was found! Oh, at that time, in gracious
   answer to prayer almost as soon as we began to pray, perhaps, we had an
   instance of how He goes before us with the blessings of His goodness!
   We were not fit to receive His mercy--so we thought--but His mercy
   came. We were not ready for Christ, but Christ came to us. We felt
   ourselves so hardened, but He came and softened us. We could not
   squeeze out a tear, but He accepted the dry bottles that would have had
   tears in them if they could. We felt as if we were just nothing--but
   Christ knew that our nothingness made room for Him to be everything--so
   He came and took us at our worst and gave Himself to be ours forever
   and ever! Oh, if He had waited until we had washed that foul face, and
   taken away every stain with floods of tears--oh, if He had waited until
   we had cleansed those filthy hands and washed them snowy white, until
   we had found a wedding dress in which we should have been fit to
   come--ah, Savior, You would have waited even till now and even forever,
   for we never could have been fit for You! But no sooner did we long to
   come, no sooner did we feel that we would gladly come if we dared, but
   felt that we were all unfit to come, than Your swift feet of mercy
   brought You to Your children, and the Grace was given for which we
   scarcely dared to hope! That is my experience, Brothers and Sisters,
   and I know that it is yours--God in the matter of conversion going
   before us with His mercy!

   And how has it been since then? Take another illustration from your
   life. Have you not oftentimes been prevented by the God of your
   mercy--by directions given when you were just about to take a wrong
   step? I remember well, and never can forget, how the whole turn of my
   life was made by the Providence of God in what we would call an
   accident.

   I certainly, in all probability, had not been here tonight if it had
   not been that an engagement made to meet a certain gentleman at a
   certain time was punctually kept by us both, but a servant showed him
   into one room on one side of the passage, and showed me into another on
   the other side--and we sat there two hours waiting for one another, but
   missed each other--and so the whole current of my life flowed in
   another direction! I recollect a course of action which I would have
   adopted, but from which I was altogether turned by hearing, as I
   thought, as I walked alone and sought direction, such a voice as this,
   "Seek you great things for yourself? Seek them not." That text guided
   me in what I believe was a right, prudent and certainly has been a
   happy way! Had it not been for that, I might have gone astray,
   unwittingly, but still unwisely, into all sorts of paths! Have you not
   found it so? Just when you did not know which way to go you had the
   direction when you sought it. If you applied to God, He gave you
   guidance by some means, just as surely as the Jew had it when he
   resorted to the priest who wore the Urim and the Thummim. Take care
   that you always recollect this in the future, if it has been so in the
   past. God has gone before you, and marked out your path for you--and
   given you a plain map of the way. Has it not been so?

   Moreover, He not only tells us the way, and so prevents us, but He
   clears the way for us. Great difficulties have frequently run in our
   way in Providence and in Grace, and we have been like the women who
   went to the sepulcher. We have said, one to another, "Who shall roll
   away the stone for us?" But when we have come there, behold, "the stone
   was rolled away for it was very great." God had made a road where we
   could not see any and could not make any. What? Have you never gone
   through the Red Sea? Have the waters never stood upright as a heap on
   either side while you, as God's chosen, went through? I know you have
   had an experience analogous to that! Then treasure up the memory of it.

   Do not be ashamed now, in your talks with your fellow Christians, to
   tell that the Lord has gone before you with His goodness, in clearing
   the way for you!

   How frequently, too, has He gone before us with His goodness, by
   supplying our needs! Like the Israelites, who, however early they rose
   in the morning, found the manna from Heaven awaiting them, so has it
   been with you, with all who trust God! Your needs have not come as
   quickly as the supplies. In fact, some of us have only known our needs
   by finding the supplies sent! And we have said, "Then I must have
   needed this, or it would not have come." And we have blessed the Lord
   as we have seen our soul's necessities in the light of the Grace that
   has come to supply them! Oh, it has been so with you--you know it has!
   You have had to move, perhaps, from place to place, and God has
   prepared the place for you. It may be that your life has consisted much
   of wandering to and fro, and tossing about, yet, though you seemed like
   a football, you have never been tossed anywhere but what you have
   fallen on your feet, and fallen into the place, too, that God had
   provided and prepared for you! So it has been up to the present, has it
   not? Has He not thus gone before you with His goodness?

   And once again, how often, dear Friends, when we have begun to pray for
   a mercy, we have had the mercy while we have yet been calling--while we
   have been speaking He has heard us! How frequently have we desired to
   return from our backslidings, and while we have been desiring to
   return, He has appeared and melted us down in penitence and gratitude.
   We have desired sanctification, and we have had the rod sent to our
   house directly, which was probably the very speediest way to ensure our
   growth in that respect. Whatever we have actually needed of the Lord,
   our God, He has not withheld it from us in its season, so that we will
   join in saying that until now it has been so, it has been so. The God
   of our mercy has gone before us. Now, in the second place--

   II. IT SHALL BE SO.

   It shall be so with you who are seeking Christ tonight. God's rule for
   the future is His action and conduct in the past. He never changes. You
   must not imagine that Jesus Christ will be sterner with you than He has
   been with others like you. If it has been His custom to reject those
   who have come, He will reject you. But if it has never been so, it
   never shall be so, for, "Him that comes to Me, I will in nowise cast
   out." Hearken, then, to Jesus now! God will go before you with the
   blessings of His goodness. Now, you have been thinking lately--

   "I'll to the gracious King approach,

   Whose scepter mercy gives."

   And you have thought to yourself, "Before I can come, I must feel my
   need aright." Now, you think you do not feel your need and you have
   been troubled a great deal lately because you have not that tenderness
   of heart that you ought to have. Now, if you cannot come to Christ with
   a broken heart, come to Christ fora broken heart! He is ready to give
   it to you. The preparation of the heart in man is from the Lord in this
   respect. Come and tell Him that you need a broken heart. One of the
   best prayers you can pray is, "Lord, create a right spirit within me."
   You say, perhaps, "Sir, I need more than a broken heart--I need even to
   learn to pray." Well, I remember what Mr. Fuller once said to a young
   man who was trying to pray and could not. He whispered to Mr. Fuller,
   who was kneeling by his side, "I cannot pray." "Tell the Lord so," said
   Mr. Fuller. So, Brothers and Sisters, when you say, "I cannot pray as I
   would. I cannot express myself as I desire," go and tell the Lord that
   you are a poor, ignorant soul, and that you do not know how to pray,
   and say, "Lord, teach me." "Oh, but I do not feel the desire I need to
   feel." I have often found that those who have most of desire think they
   have not any. Well, go and tell the Lord about that, and ask Him to
   give you the desire which shall be necessary to make earnest prayer,
   that you may begin to pray, that you may have a broken heart. Wherever
   you like to go back to, I will go back with you, but I will tell you
   that Jesus Christ was there before you, and that He will meet you there
   with just what your souls need! He is there ready with it. He will go
   before you with the blessings of His goodness. The God of my mercy
   shall go before! "Well," says one, "but I think that I ought to have
   some sort of preparation for God. I do not mean merit, but still, there
   must be the cleansing of the hands and the reformation of the heart."
   Yes, I know there must, and I know what is more--that there willbe all
   that if you come to Christ for it--but if you try to work this in
   yourselves, beforeyou come to Him, you will certainly fail!

   Now, instead of going roundabout to find preparations for Christ by way
   of reformation, come to Him as you are, for He will give you all the
   fitness that you think you ought to bring. He has got it all. Christ
   did not come to save the righteous, but sinners, just as a physician
   does not present himself to heal those who are whole, but to heal those
   who aresick. "But I do not feel my sickness." That is part of your
   sickness that you do not feel your sickness. Come and have that cured
   as well as all the rest! Do not think that you are to patch up a part
   of the cure and then to come to Him! But oh, stand to one side and let
   Him go before you with the blessings of His goodness, of His love, His
   blood and His Holy Spirit. He will meet you just where you are.

   "But I am desirous to be saved," says one "and I do not think that
   Christ is willing to have me." Ah, but remember the verse we sometimes
   sing--

   "No sinner can be beforehand with Thee--

   Your Grace is most Sovereign, most rich, and most free."

   If you have a heart-felt desire after Christ, I know where you obtained
   it. It never grew in your garden. The dust heap of your heart would
   never yield so sweet a flower as that! It is the Grace of God that has
   made you desire Christ and for every spark of desire that you have to
   Christ, Christ has a volcano full of desire after you! Oh, if you have
   but a farthing's worth of desire for Him, He has ten thousand pounds
   worth of desire towards you! You cannot outrun Christ, I am sure. "I
   would gladly be at peace with God," says one. "I throw down the weapons
   of my rebellion tonight! I will say, 'Lord, accept me.'" And do you
   think that He is unwilling to be at peace with you? Why, there never
   was any unwillingness on His part! He wills not the death of a sinner,
   but had rather that he would turn unto Him and live. Oh, do not
   imagine, do not imagine, any of you, that if there is any distance
   between you and God, God makes the distance! No, it is your own heart,
   your own unbelief, your love of sin--something sinful on your side--it
   is no lack of Grace on His side! I do not say that God will meet you
   half-way--I do not believe He will--but I believe He will meet you all
   the way, every inch of it, that He will meet you just where you are!
   Like the poor man that was left between Jerusalem and Jericho, of whom
   it is said that the good Samaritan came "where he was," so Jesus will
   come and pour in the oil and the wine to heal and quicken. Only cry
   unto Him! If you cannot frame words, groan out your prayer! Let your
   aching heart but cry, "My God, have mercy on me! For Jesus' sake,
   forgive me!" and He will outrun you, Sinner! He will outrun you! He
   will anticipate the prayer and grant the blessing! Why are you afraid
   to come? You know not what God is, or you would come right willingly
   and tell Him all your case. He can meet it! He understands it! He knows
   it now! Oh, come! Seek the secrecy of your chamber. Tell out as best
   you can, your sins, your fears, your weaknesses and unbelief--and trust
   in that Son of God, who became Man that He might lift men up to
   God--and as surely as you trust Him, you shall be saved!

   But now, it shall be so, to you who are the people of God. He will go
   before you with the blessings of His goodness in the future, as He has
   done in the past. Now, you are, perhaps, going across the sea to
   America or Australia. Well, He will be there before you. All is well!
   He has arranged it for you before you get there, and you shall have
   reason to say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord, He has come where His
   servant should come and has prepared a place for him, and made him a
   sphere of labor." Or it may be, my dear Friend, that you do not know
   just where you are going. Well, I do not know that you need fret
   yourself about it, for if you walk by faith in the living God, you are
   going just where He knows it is best for you to go--and He will go
   before you. As surely as ever His glorious marching was through the
   wilderness with the hosts of Israel, so will there be glorious marching
   at your head to lead you in a right way and to bring you to a city to
   dwell therein. Trust in Him with full confidence and go onward, for He
   shall be your Guide and lead the van.

   I speak now especially to the members of this Church. It is a blessed
   thing to reflect upon, that in all Christian service, God will go
   before us. When our missionaries have gone to foreign lands, it has
   often happened that before the missionary has arrived, there has been a
   tradition in the minds of the people that there would be white men who
   would come to teach them some new thing--and thus they have been
   prepared for it and frequently whole tribes have speedily given ear to
   the Gospel of Christ, because for many years God had been leading them
   to expect His Gospel! Now, what has happened in heathen countries is
   happening every day in our own country! I believe that God prepares the
   minds of the people for the preacher as much as ever He does prepare
   the preacher for the people! I ask the Lord to give me preparation for
   the pulpit, but I often think that the other side of it--the
   preparation of the people for the pulpit--is equally important, and
   that the Lord will give it in answer to prayer! Now, how often, dear
   Friends, when you try to do good, you will discover that the person you
   are anxious about has been prepared by God on purpose for you? For
   instance, a man has been sick and ill. Ah, you see he had been
   thoughtless, before, and God has just been plowing the soil by making
   the man thoughtful and careful, in order that he may now listen to the
   Gospel. There are a thousand different sorrowsthat Cross over men's
   minds. A working man, for instance, may during the day feel depressed,
   and he does not know why. Some recollections of his early childhood may
   come across him, but he cannot tell why, and you, perhaps, meet him ten
   minutes after that. If you would but speak to Him of Christ, you would
   be surprised to find that you had come just in the very nick of time,
   when God had made the man ready for you and then sent you as a
   messenger from Him! Believe it, that whenever you feel an extraordinary
   anxiety after a soul, you may take it as an indication that that soul
   is as much needing you as you are needing it! There is a something that
   will attract that person to you, as well as you to that person. Or if
   you should seem to be repelled, God has still a design there, and you
   must try again, and labor again--for a blessing will certainly come.
   God is preparing the man even while that man repulses you--preparing
   him for the time when at last he shall cheerfully accept that Savior
   whom you propose to him!

   My Brothers, as God's servants, we are very much in the position of
   Joshua with the Israelites when they came up to Canaan. They were to
   conquer Canaan, but do you know Canaan had been conquered long before?
   For if you conquer a man's heart, it is merely a matter of detail to go
   and conquer his body, and God had sent before a rumor of what He would
   do, and Rahab told them that she knew that the hearts of the Canaanites
   were melted in them for fear. Moreover, God sent diseases and sent the
   hornet so that these people were dying, and those who were living were
   weakened by disease and stung by hornets, so that the Jewish hosts had
   an easy work. They had but to take what God had made ready for them! Go
   up, go up, O hosts of the Lord, for God has conquered the land
   beforehand for you! All these sorrows and griefs, all the calamities of
   wars, all the miseries of nations are but convincing them, as they
   shall be convinced, that their idols cannot help them! And even as to
   the Antichrist of Rome, all the kings that have committed fornication
   with her shall hate her, and shall burn her flesh as with fire! God is
   working secretly, God is working mysteriously and mightily! Only be
   encouraged, O Church of God, to go up and take the prey, for Jericho
   shall fall before your shouts, as God, even the Lord, your God, shall
   be exalted, as you win the last great victory! Think of all this
   through this month when you will be hard at work and just go in to win
   a soul. Go in for God has gone before you! You, dear Teacher, be
   earnest with that child, for God is intending to bless it and is
   getting that child ready! Your instrumentality shall fit to that heart
   as a key does to the wards of the lock. God is preparing you and
   preparing it, and good will come of it!

   And now, lastly, Brothers and Sisters. We shall soon expect to have
   done with laboring for Christ and to have done with pilgrimage and all
   its cares, except that we shall have the last river to pass over. But
   then, "the God of my mercy shall go before me." There shall be the
   delightful Presence of Jesus and the shining company of angels, and the
   visions of Glory yet to be revealed--and we shall forget the pangs of
   earth in the joys of the heavenly land! Like one drop of bitterness
   that is drowned in the flood of sweetness, death shall be swallowed up
   in victory, and when we come to Heaven, itself, we shall discover that
   our God has gone before us there. "Behold," says the Redeemer, "I go to
   prepare a place for you." Oh, how delightful it is to think of going to
   Heaven where there will be nothing to get ready, but where all will be
   just as we need it--all that can be required to give to us the highest
   conceivable happiness, all ready, and all made ready by Christ!
   Rejoice, then, Believer! He will go before you through this earth and
   before you into Heaven, where He has already gone, bless His name! Live
   happily! Live happily! Live to serve Him out of gratitude for what He
   has done, and the Lord bless you evermore. Amen and Amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM116:1-6; ROMANS 5:10-21.

   Verse 1. I love the LORD because He has heard my voice and my
   supplications. You cannot help loving God if He has heard your prayers.
   Have you tried Him? If you have, you can join with David and thousands
   of others in confessing that He is a prayer-hearing God and, therefore,
   you love Him. I find the verse might be read, "I love the Lord because
   He hears." He is always hearing. I am always speaking to Him and He is
   always hearing me. Therefore I love Him. Can you imagine a better
   reason for love?

   2. Because He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   Him as long as I live. "He has inclined His ear"--stooped down, as it
   were, as you do to a sick person to catch his faintest word. "He has
   inclined His ear." He has heard my prayer when I could hardly hear it
   myself! When it was such a broken prayer, such a feeble prayer, that I
   was afraid I had not prayed, yet He heard me! He inclined His ear and,
   "therefore, will I call upon Him as long as I live."

   That is, I will never leave off praying and I will never leave off
   praising. This is the best gratitude we can show to God. Now, if a
   beggar were to say to us, "If you will help me today, I will beg of you
   as long as I live," we would not be very thankful! But when we say this
   to God, He is glad, for He wants us to be thus continually calling upon
   Him.

   3, 4. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of Hell got hold
   upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the
   LORD--O LORD, I beseech You, deliver my soul He felt as if he had been
   hunted. As in hunting, they sometimes surround the stag with dogs as
   with a cordon, so he says, "the sorrows of death compassed me. There
   was no getting away. I was in a circle of sorrow." Worse than that, his
   pains of conscience and heart were so great that he says, "The pains of
   Hell get hold upon me"--got the grip of him, as though he were arrested
   by them--as though those dogs had come so close as to seize and grasp
   him. "Then," he says, "I called." At the worst extremity he prayed.
   There is no time too bad to pray! When it is all over with you, still
   pray. Often the end of yourself is the beginning of your God. He means
   to get you away from every other confidence, that you may fling
   yourself upon Him. "Then called I upon the name of the Lord."

   And what was the prayer? A very short one--"O Lord, I beseech You,
   deliver my soul." God does not measure prayers by the yard. It is not
   by the length, but by the weight. If there is life, earnestness, heart
   in your prayer, it is all the better for being short. Read the Bible
   through and you will scarcely find a long prayer. Prayers that come
   from the soul are often like arrows shot from the bow--quick, short,
   sharp! And God hears such prayers as these--"O Lord, I beseech You,
   deliver my soul."

   5. Gracious is the LORD, and righteous. Wonderful combination--gracious
   and yet righteous! And if you want to know how this can be, look at
   Calvary, where Jesus dies that we may live! "Oh, the sweet wonders of
   that Cross, where God the Savior loved and died"--where there was the
   Justice of God to the fullest and the mercy of God without bound.
   "Gracious is the Lord, and righteous."

   5, 6. Yes, our God is merciful. The LORD preserves the simple. Those
   that have such a deal of wit may take care of themselves, but, "the
   Lord preserves the simple," the straightforward, the
   plain-minded--those who believe His Word without raising questions.
   "The Lord preserves the simple."

   6. I was brought low and He helped me.Oh, many of you can say this, I
   trust, and if you cannot, I hope you will before long--"I was brought
   low and He helped me."

   ROMANS 5:10-21.

   10. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall by saved by His
   life.This is a grand argument for the safety of all Believers, having a
   three-fold edge to it! If He reconciled His enemies, will He not save
   His friends? If He reconciled us, will He not save us? If He reconciled
   us by the death, will He not save us by the life of His Son?

   11. And not only so The blessings of the Covenant of Grace rise tier
   upon tier, mountain upon mountain, Alp on Alp. When you climb to what
   seems the utmost summit, there is a height yet beyond you. "And not
   only so"--

   11. But we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
   have now received the atonement Then he begins to explain the great
   plan of our salvation.

   12. Therefore as by one man, sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinnedIn that
   one man.

   13. 14. For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed
   when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses,
   even over them that hadnot sinnedafter the similitude of Adam's
   transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come. Children died
   who had not actually sinned, themselves, but died because of Adam's
   sin.

   15-17. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift For if through
   the offense of one, many are dead, much more the Grace of God and the
   gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto
   many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
   judgment was by one, to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
   offenses unto justification. For if by one man's offense--By Adams'
   sin.

   17, 18. Death reigned by one: much more they which receive abundance of
   Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one,
   Jesus Christ Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon
   all men to condemnation: even so by the righteousness of One, the free
   gift came upon all men unto justification of life. All who are in
   Christ are justified by Christ, just as all who were in Adam were lost
   and condemned in Adam. The "alls" are not equal in extent-- equal as
   far as the person goes in whom the "alls" were found. And this is our
   hope--that we, being in Christ, are justified because of His
   righteousness.

   19. 20. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
   the obedience of One shall many be made righteous. Moreover the Law
   entered--The law of Moses.

   20. That the offense might abound, but where sin abounded, Grace did
   much more abound. It makes us see sin where we never saw it. It comes
   on purpose to drive us to despair of being saved by works. It bids us
   look to the flames that Moses saw, and shrink and tremble with despair.

   21. That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might Grace reign
   through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

"Brief Life Is Here Our Portion"

   (No. 3414)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "LORD make me to know my end and the measure of my days, what it is,
   that I may know how frail I am." Psalm 39:4.

   ACCORDING to the judgment of Calvin, and some of the ablest
   commentators, there is a kind of pettishness in this verse. The context
   appears to imply that David had grown impatient under the chastening
   hand of God. Job, under similar circumstances, longed to accomplish as
   a hireling, his day, and sought the repose of the grave. And so the
   Psalmist inquires how much longer he has to bear the ills and griefs of
   life, or when the goal shall be reached. But I am sure it is not for
   any of us to upbraid the Psalmist, for what is his impatience compared
   with ours? When I read of Elijah casting himself under the juniper
   tree, saying, "Let me die, I am no better than my fathers!"--should I
   wonder at the weakness of so great a man--it is only because he is
   great! No doubt that kind of weakness has seized us all. We have, every
   now and then, expressed a longing to depart--not so much, I fear,
   because of our eagerness to be with Christ, as because we have grown
   weary with the trials, the services and the sufferings of this poor
   wilderness. Well, if we are the subjects of the same infirmity as these
   godly men of old, we must flee where they fled for strength to grapple
   with these infirmities and overcome them! We must look to the Strong
   for strength and pray God to work in us that ripe fruit of patience so
   rare and yet so precious, for it greatly glorifies God wherever it is
   brought forth!

   David here asks the Lord to be his Teacher. Observe the words, "Make me
   to know.." That is to say, "Instruct me, let me be the scholar, and You
   condescend to my ignorance and weakness, and teach me." What? But did
   not David know his end? Did he not know the measure of his days? Was
   his frailty a secret that he could not discover? We may be sure that he
   knew it in part--knew it, perhaps, in that superficial manner in which
   many of us assent to moral and spiritual truths, with little
   understanding and no appreciation. But he wanted to know it after a
   more perfect way--he would apprehend it with that spiritual
   enlightenment which God alone can communicate. Upon the dishes at the
   china factories you have, perhaps, seen an impression produced--the
   inscription is to be there in the future--that is, like common
   knowledge. Have you afterwards seen that piece of china when it has
   passed through the oven, has been baked, and comes forth with what you
   saw there, superficially baked into its very substance? Such should be
   our prayer, that what we know as upon the surface may be burned into
   our innermost consciences, may become indelibly a part of our own
   selves. Lord, not only make me to know, but make me to know by Your own
   Divine art--burn it into me--make me to know my end and the measure of
   my days. Observe the condescension of God, that we are allowed to ask
   Him to teach us such a lesson as our frailty! And mark the proof of our
   own ignorance and our own forgetfulness that we cannot even learn this
   lesson unless God teaches us! And must He make us know? We need that
   our minds should be renewed, as it were, by a creative or a
   regenerating process, else we shall fail to discern the very simplest
   Truths of God. Confessing our ignorance, let us go to God with the
   prayer of the Psalmist and He willanswer us.

   There are, then, three things which the Psalmist wishes to know--his
   end, the measure of his days and growing out of these, a just estimate
   of his own frailty. May the Lord teach us to profit while we meditate
   upon them!

   I. "LORD, MAKE ME TO KNOW MY END."

   Do we know this already? If you do, let your pure minds be stirred up
   by way of remembrance. The certainty of your end--try to know that by
   grasping the fact and letting the truth of it affect your souls. Yes, I
   must die unless the Lord should come and I should be caught up together
   with the saints in the air. I must reach the terminus of this mortal
   life as other men, on the couch of weakness and the bed of death. I
   must die. There is no discharge in this war. There is no possibility of
   your having an everlasting life here. You don't desire it if you are
   Christians! Neither could you have it if you did desire it--a time will
   come when you must depart. Think, then, dear Brothers and
   Sisters--common places will beuseful to you. Let it pass over your
   soul, that for you the funeral bell must toll, for you the grave be
   dug, for you the winding-sheet and the cerements of the tomb, for you,
   "earth to earth, and dust to dust, and ashes to ashes," as sure as you
   are a man. Being born mortal, you must die. The Lord make you to know
   this! You must die, not another for you! You must gather up your feet
   into the bed and, like old Jacob, pass across the stream, the narrow
   stream of death. You, though now in the prime of life, or in the gaiety
   of childhood. You who have escaped so many accidents and are now ripe
   and mellow in the quietude of old age--the dearest friend and companion
   cannot be a sponsor for you. When the call shall come, your pitcher
   must be broken at the fountain, your wheel at the cistern and you, in
   your own proper flesh and blood, must pass away--and your disembodied
   spirit must stand before God. Forget not, then, the certainty, or the
   personality of it!

   It shall be conclusive, "Make me to know my end." It shall not be a
   halt, but a finale. Not a starting on the road, but a termination of
   the great journey of life. "My end," my end for all things beneath the
   sun, the end of my sin as far as this world is concerned and the end of
   my service of Almighty God! The end of all my opportunities of doing
   good, of my occasions of getting good. My end so that whatever after is
   done under the sun, I shall have no share nor interest in it. The
   living know that they must die, but the dead know not anything! Other
   saints walk over their graves, nations rise and fall, convulsions shake
   the most solid empires, all things change--but there, beneath the sod,
   they slumber on. Their memory and their love are lost alike--"unknowing
   and unknown." Certainly we shall come to an end. Certainly I, myself,
   shall come to that end, and when my death comes, it will, for this life
   and this mortal state, be a veritable end which I cannot pass.

   While musing on our end, the accompaniments of our end may well excite
   passing reflection. In all probability, Brothers and Sisters, though we
   know not what may come to us, our departure out of this life will be
   attended with the same languor and prostration we have witnessed in the
   case of others. We may expect the sick bed, the days of pain and the
   sleepless nights which are the premonitions of decease. We may imagine
   for ourselves what we have so often seen among our kinsfolk and
   acquaintances--the family gathered in silent watchfulness and the
   weeping children summoned to give the parting kiss--while the hot tears
   fall on the blanched cheeks of the departing. We can picture it all to
   our minds. It may be well we should, and make a rehearsal of it, too,
   for it is probable enough that so it may come. We are not sure that we
   shall take so deliberate a leave of the world. It may happen to us in
   the crowded streets. Our end may come to us as we go by the way. That,
   however, rather strikes us as the course of Nature, when there is the
   taking down of the tent, the folding up of the canvas, the putting away
   of each pin and pin-hold, and so we shall be removed as a shepherd's
   tent. Then will come a leaving of all earthly things--your shutters
   will be put up by somebody else--your books will be no more kept by
   you--you will have struck the balance for the last time. Some other
   hand must go out to earn the children's bread, now that the father is
   gone. Some other woman's tender care must watch over the little ones,
   now that the mother is no more. And the time must come when the rich
   man shall bid farewell to his parks and lawns, when he must bid
   farewell to his mortgages, to his bonds, his deeds and his estates. And
   the poor man, who may, perhaps, find it as hard, must bid farewell to
   the cottage and the hearth, and all that made life dear to him. There
   will be a parting time for each of us, and we pray the Lord make us to
   anticipate it! In connection with this, it is probable there will be
   many regrets to all of us. I hope when we come to die it will be no
   question as to whether we are saved or not. But even to a saved man,
   there arises this thought, "Oh, that I had glorified God more! Oh, that
   I had devoted of my substance, and of my time, and of my talents, more
   to my Master's service! I can no more feed the hungry, or clothe the
   naked, or teach the ignorant. Oh, that those golden opportunities had
   been seized more eagerly, and employed more industriously by me! But
   now my time for service here is over, and I am mourning the scantiness
   of my life-work--and I cannot amend that which is faulty, or supply
   that which is lacking." Our end, Beloved, will be the end of all our
   Christian labor here below. No going to your Sunday school class any
   more. No coming, again, of the preacher to his rostrum. No standing
   here to admonish or to console. No more will the corner of the street
   listen to your voice, my Brother, in your earnest evangelizing. No
   longer can your hand be outstretched to distribute the Word which tells
   of the great Savior and the good Shepherd--our Lord Jesus Christ. On
   that bed you will be taking leave of all your Christian service and if
   anything has been left undone, there will then be no opportunity to
   complete it. Depend upon it--and it is wise to look forward to the
   event--our end will be no child's play. We may often smile and sing
   about death and long for evening to approach, that we may rest with
   God, but it is, at the same time, a most solemn thing. The best way to
   deal with it is to die daily, to go down to Jordan's brink and bathe
   every morning in that death stream, till death shall be as familiar as
   life, till you shallcome to think of it with daily expectation! Yet at
   times we almost wonder that we are lingering here, for we are expecting
   to be called away to dwell in the land of the living, where there is no
   more death, nor sorrow, nor sighing.

   Then, again, it will be well for us to be made to know our end in all
   its results. Although it is called our end, yet surely it is, strictly
   speaking, a great beginning! A more true beginning, I was about to say,
   even than our first birth. The moment a man dies, he then enters upon
   the most solemn part of his existence. Make me, Lord, to know what it
   will be after this, my departure. What will then happen to me? Come,
   let me reflect. My soul must wing her way without the body up to the
   Throne of God, and there, at once, receive the preliminary sentence,
   the forecast of the sentence of the Last Tremendous Day. "Committed for
   trial," to lie in durance vile without the body till the Resurrection
   trumpet, or be admitted into Glory, such as that Glory can be without
   the body, until the Lord Jesus Christ shall descend from Heaven with a
   shout, and the trumpet of the archangel, and the voice of God! Which
   will it be with me? Ask this, dear Hearers, and ask your God to make
   you to know which it shall be--your spirit rejoicing in the Presence of
   Christ, your Savior, far from the world of grief and sin, eternally
   shut in with God--or shall it be your spirit mocking among kindred
   condemned in the Pit that has no bottom, where the iron key is turned
   and through the door of which there can be no escape? Which shall it be
   with you? When you think of your end, remember one of these must be
   your portion--Heaven or Hell! Then comes the Day of Judgment and of the
   Resurrection. The clarion, clear and shrill, shall be such as wakens
   man, not for battle, nor sleepers for the fray--it shall wake the
   long-buried from their silent graves and they shall rise from sea and
   land an exceedingly great multitude! Then shall the Great White Throne
   be set and the books be opened! This is the end God will have you to
   know. Oh, seek to know it! When that book is opened, and Christ shall
   read with eyes of fire, and with a voice of thunder, what shall the
   Lord award you? Will He turn to the page and say, "Blotted out with My
   blood are all the transgressions that were once recorded here and,
   therefore, there is nothing now to read except that which is the award
   of My chosen. I was hungry, and you gave Me meat; I was thirsty and you
   gave Me drink; sick and imprisoned, and you ministered unto Me! Come,
   you blessed!" Or will it be to see the page turned over and to hear the
   voice declare, "I was hungry, and you gave Me no meat; thirsty and you
   gave Me no drink"? Will it be a record all of sin, and not of virtue,
   with the accompanying sentence, "Depart, you cursed, into everlasting
   fire"? "Lord make me to know my end," and let not my end be to be
   banished forever with the wicked! Gather not my life with sinners, nor
   my soul with bloody men! Cast me not away from Your Presence! Banish me
   not from Your mercy! Shut me not up in the lowest Pit! Condemn me not
   to eternal destruction from the Presence of the Lord! "Make me to know
   my end," and let this be the end--to be with Christ where He is, to
   behold His Glory, the Glory which You gave Him from before the
   foundation of the world!

   It seems to me that when David prayed that he might be made to know his
   end, he well knew these were the accompaniments. But the way in which
   he wished to be made to know them was that he might be made to believe
   in them firmly, so as to realize them vividly, look upon them not as
   fictions, myths and traditions, but as realities--that he might be made
   to know them, so as to meditate upon them, to have his mind exercised
   constantly about them--that he might be made to know them so as to be
   prepared for them and to set his house in order, because he must die,
   and not live, preparing to meet his God. And, above all, that he might
   know his end by having a full assurance of being saved in Christ Jesus,
   so that his end should be everlasting peace! "Mark the perfect man, and
   behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace." Oh, that we
   might, while mentioning such men, become such men ourselves--and know
   that our end shall be peace through Jesus Christ! Now, in the second
   part of the prayer, David says--

   II. "MAKE ME TO KNOW THE MEASURE OF MY DAYS."

   It is a very humbling thing to recollect that our days have a measure.
   In the Latin there is a proverb, "As poor men count their sheep." And
   it is only because we are so poor in life that we are able to measure
   our days. God's days are not to be counted. "Your generations, who can
   tell, or count the number of Your years? From everlasting to
   everlasting You are God." "The measure of our days." Ask in prayer that
   you may be made to know this. I will just give some outlines, like a
   drawing-master's sketch on the blackboard. How insignificant the
   measure of my days--what a very little time I have to live after all.
   If 70 years is my term, of what small account they are! Perhaps you
   have sometimes stood by a sand-cliff, as I did the other day, looking
   at alternate layers of shells, one above another. I should think at
   least one hundred feet thick of shells of a modern sort succeeded by
   thin layers of sand! Now, this must undoubtedly have been formed by the
   gradual deposit of some ancient sea, but how long must it have taken to
   have composed a rock of one hundred feet thick of white shells and
   sand? Well, but that is only a comparatively small layer of this earth.
   We go a little deeper andwe find sandstone and limestone which must
   have taken, if the laws of Nature have been at all in other times as
   they are now, not thousands, but even millions of years to form by the
   gradual deposit of the ocean! You go deeper, still, and at last you
   come to rocks made by fire, and the geologist is most reasonably led to
   the conclusion that this world, as it now stands, must have existed
   several millions of years, because it has taken so long a time to
   collect these various deposits. I know as I stood poking my stick into
   this sand and shells, I felt as if I had shriveled into a little ant
   and less even than a tiny animalcule which had scarcely come into this
   world when it was driven away and there were these rocks looking at me,
   and saying, Where were you when we were formed? When the waving ocean
   was washing up these shells, where were you? But now take your mind
   away from this world and recollect that some beings dear to us are
   older than this world, for when this world was made, the morning stars
   sang and shouted for joy! Oh, you angels--what infants we must seem in
   comparison with your age! Where were you when Gabriel first flew upon
   his errand, swift as lightning? Where were you when sin made Lucifer,
   Sun of the Morning, descend swift beneath the wrath of God into the
   shades of darkness which are reserved for him forever? What is your
   life when once compared with the period of life which cherubim and
   seraphim have seen? Oh, but what are cherubim and seraphim compared
   with God? When, in this great world, sun, moon and stars had not begun,
   God was as great and glorious as He is now! And when the whole of this
   Creation shall be rolled up like a worn out scroll, He will be the
   same--no older in a myriad myriad years than He is now, for with Him
   there is no time--

   "He fills His own eternal Now, And sees our ages pass."

   All things are present to Him! We are carried away as with a flood, but
   He sits serene, neither age nor time change Him! "Lord, make me to know
   the measure of my days." Help me to fall down in my utter
   insignificance before Your Throne, adoring Your eternal majesty--

   "Great God, how infinite are Thee, What worthless worms are we! Let the
   whole race of creatures bow, And pay their praise to Thee."

   While seeking to know the measure of our days, let the great importance
   that attaches to them stand out distinctly before us, for on this link
   our everlasting destiny is hung. It is this life which, as far as we
   are concerned, decides the next. In this life a Believer, then a life
   of Glory, happiness, and immortality! In this life an unbeliever, then
   in the next life, in the world to come, everlasting punishment from the
   hand of God! This thought makes even this little life swell to
   won-drously great proportions! Here is a man next door to a worm and
   yet next door to God--born but yesterday and yet his existence will go
   on perpetually with God, for man shall not die! So momentous, and yet
   so insignificant! So magnificent, and yet so minute is the measure of
   my days!

   "Lord, make me to know the measure of my days"--the certainty of that
   measure. God has appointed that you shall not die before the time--you
   shall certainly not live beyond it. That thread shall be cut off in its
   due season--

   "Plagues and death around me fly, Till He wills, I cannot die."

   While I admonish you to remember the certainty, let me urge you to
   reflect upon the uncertainty of it, as far as you are concerned. You
   may live another twenty, thirty, or forty years--or you may not live as
   many seconds! You may be spared for the next 50 years, and still taking
   part in life's battle. Or it may be that before the clock has ticked
   again, you may be like a warrior taking his rest. Certain to God, but
   uncertain to you! It is well, in thinking of our days, to remember they
   will be quite long enough for us if God helps us to use them well. Life
   is very short, but a great deal may be done. Our Lord Jesus Christ, in
   three years, saved the world! Some of His followers in three years have
   been the means of saving many and many a soul. It was a short life that
   Luther had to do his great work in. If I remember rightly, he was hard
   upon 50 before he began to preach the Truth of God at all! This is a
   hopeful sign for some of you who have wasted your young days! There
   have been men of 60 that have yet achieved a life's work before they
   had slept and gone their way. After all, time is long or short as you
   like to make it so. One man lives a 100 years and dies a worldling. And
   yet another man, through God's Grace, puts forth as much energy in two
   or three years as if he were a thunderbolt launched from the hands of
   God! And he leaves his name among imperishable memorials. Your life
   will be long enough to achieve great things if God will help you to
   remember, in measuring your days, that they will be quite short enough
   for the enterprise you have in hand. You will only have finished the
   picture when the master palsies the arm and makes you drop the pencil.

   And you will only have completed the day's work when the shadow shall
   have fallen and you shall go Home to your rest. Work with all your
   might, but don't work despondingly--there is time enough for your soul
   to glorify God! Do your piece of the great work, though it be but a
   hair's breadth you are allowed to perform, and though it is as nothing
   in the presence of Him whose mighty deeds are shown through all
   generations. Shall I need to say anything more about measuring our
   days, except that it may be a painful recollection for us to remember
   that if they are not longer days, it is the prevalence of sin that made
   it necessary to shorten them! We might have lived to the age of
   Methuselah but the Antediluvian fathers so filled the earth with
   violence that God sent a flood and swept them all away! It is great
   mercy that men don't live too long. Where were progress if the old men
   of 200 years ago were here to obstruct it? Where the chance for reform
   if the vested interests of avarice were permitted to accumulate without
   any check? Now, however, the old blood is constantly superseded by
   fresh blood and the stream of life is kept purer by the passing away of
   the old conservative element, which when here, was exceedingly good in
   its season, but must give place to the influx of a spring tide more
   adapted to the growth of the times. Thank God, the great infidels don't
   live forever--who would have wished to have a Voltaire forever stalking
   about this world! What a mercy that his was but a short life! What
   would you think if you had a Tom Paine blustering against Almighty God
   500 years at a stretch? A mercy it is that even good men don't live
   here forever, because their temptations would so accumulate in the
   recollection of years of service, that self-righteousness would become
   inveterate, hero worship an established idolatry and dogmatism a
   nuisance without abatement! I grant you experience might come in to
   modify some of the evils, for so the Grace of God can do anything--but
   there would be at least a natural tendency to perpetuate corruptions.
   We don't measure, I am afraid, our own years, in some respects, as we
   are known to do those of others. Some have to thank themselves that
   their lives are short--sins of their youth lie in their bones! And as
   we remember our days, we may provoke very painful recollections as to
   past sin, be checked as to all future folly and desire henceforth to
   walk in holiness and fear in the service of God until our days are
   ended. To number our days seems to me to mean, "not let them run away
   and be wasted." Hours ought to be counted--we sleep too much, some of
   us--we spend too much time at the table, too much in idle talk. Lord,
   help us to measure out our days, count them as they fly, and even the
   odd five minutes--those little pieces of time which we think we may
   idle away--much may be accomplished with them if we really set our
   minds as in the sight of eternity to employ the scraps for God. "Lord
   teach me to know the measure of my days." But my time has failed and,
   therefore, I must have but one or two words about the third point.
   David prays that he might know his frailty--

   III. LORD, HE SAID, "MAKE ME TO KNOW THAT I HAVE AN END, THAT I MAY
   KNOW MY FRAILTY."

   I must come to that end soon. I am coming to it now. Lord, make me to
   know that I am so frail that I may die at any time--early morning,
   noon, night, midnight, cockcrow. I may die in any place. If I am in the
   house of sin, I may die there. If I am in the place of worship, I may
   die there. I may die in the street. I may die while undressing tonight.
   I may die in my sleep. I may die before I get to my work tomorrow
   morning. I may die in any occupation. But God, grant I may never die a
   blasphemer! I may die with the cup of Communion at my lips. I may die
   preaching. I may die singing. In all, grant I may die as I wish to
   die--doing Your service for the love of Christ and by the power of Your
   Spirit. Perhaps, as I stand here and readily speak, the arrow is on its
   way--soon may the hand be stretched and dumb the mouth that lisps this
   faltering strain! Oh, may it never intrude upon an ill-spent hour, but
   find me wrapped in meditation and hymning my great Creator, or serving
   my fellow man with love to God, or in some way so laboring that it
   shall not come to me as a thief in the night, but shall find me
   watching, ready for His Advent! And this is what David meant, "Make me
   to know my end." It may come at any time, but let me always be ready
   for it. Make me to know the measure of my days with the same object. My
   days are measured. These days may be few--they may be very few--I may
   have come to the last one. The pilgrimage of life is a very solemn one.
   It reminds me of a caravan proceeding forward in a track--some know it,
   some of the travelers have forgotten it--but on the road which they are
   pursuing, there is a deep gulf or chasm, and some in the front part of
   the caravan have already fallen into the gulf. Others are proceeding.
   In some cases they can hear the shrieks and cries of those who have
   fallen into the chasm on ahead. But here in the darkness, in the rear
   of the caravan, there may be many others indulging in such sparks of
   fire as they have kindled. They are sounding the tabret and the cymbal,
   and still making merry--though everyone of them is going onwards
   towards the same precipice over which their comrades, who led the way,
   have already fallen! There they go--onward, onward, onward in the
   darkness, till they come to that fatal step which will plunge them into
   the world unknown! God has led you to this tabernacle well in health
   and strong, but your next step may be into eternity! Beware, then, that
   you lay hold on the hand which was once crucified lest, whenyou slip,
   there be none to hold you up! And, when you fall, there be none to
   rescue you, and you fall through the black and cheerless darkness
   forever and ever, lost, lost, lost, beyond hope of rescue! God forbid
   this for His mercy's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM90.

   "A prayer of Moses, the man of God." It is well to know the author
   because it helps you to an understanding of the Psalm. Remember that
   Moses lived in the midst of a pilgrim people who were dwelling in
   tents, journeying towards Canaan. He lived in the midst of a people
   doomed to die in the wilderness. Only two of them--Moses, himself, not
   one of them--only two of those that came out of Egypt were to be
   permitted to enter into the promised land. You may expect, therefore,
   to find much that is somber about this Psalm--and yet there is much
   that is very restful and trustful about it. If it is the prayer of
   Moses, it is the prayer of a man of God.

   Verse 1. LORD, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.
   Your chosen people have dwelt in You. You are their rest, their refuge,
   their comfort, their home. It is just the same, now, as in the days of
   Moses. God's people have no dwelling place for their souls, but their
   God. They are happy when they get to Him. In Him they dwell at ease.

   2. Before the mountains were brought forth--Before they were born like
   infants, gigantic as they are.

   2. Or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from
   everlasting to everlasting, You are God. Everything else changes. You
   do not. We lose our comforts. We dwell, as it were, in tents which are
   taken down and removed, but there is no change in You. Beloved Brothers
   and Sisters, you know this Truth of God, but do you enjoy it? I think
   there is no sweeter food for the soul than the Doctrine of the
   Immutability of the eternal existence of God--God who cannot die and
   cannot change--that is, and always is, God. Oh, He is our confidence
   and joy! As for men, what are they?

   3. You turn man to destruction and say, return, you children of men. He
   has only to speak--no need to take the scythe and mow us down. He does
   but say, "Return, you children of men," and we go back to the dust!

   4. For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is
   past, and as a watch in the night. A thousand years is a very long
   period in human history. If you fly back and try, in your knowledge of
   history, to recollect what the world was a thousand years ago, it seems
   a long, long time ago. But to God, who always lives, all the age of the
   world must seem but as the twinkling of an eye! What are a thousand
   years to You, You glorious One, before whom the past is present, and
   the future is as now?

   5. You carry them away as with a foot. Men stand, as they think,
   firmly, but as the best built buildings are swept away by a
   torrent--trees, cattle, everything dispersed before the impetuous
   outburst--so, great God, do You carry men away as with a flood!

   5, 6. They are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which
   grows up. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; in the evening it
   is cut down and withers. Have you ever watched a field of grass when in
   full bloom? There is, perhaps, no more beautiful sight! What variety of
   colors in the flowers which are the glory of the grass! And then you
   come by and the mower has done his work--and there it all lies. It has
   been withered by the sun's heat. Just such are we. Our generations fall
   before the scythe of death as falls the grass. And it is done at once.
   "In the morning it flourishes; in the evening it is cut down."

   7. For we are consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath are we
   troubled. Whenever God's anger breaks forth against a people, it must
   consume them! Oh, what a blessing it is if you and I know that His
   anger is turned away and He comforts us. Then we are not troubled by it
   any longer. Do not apply these words to yourselves. They belong to the
   Israelites in the wilderness who were dying, consumed by God's anger
   and troubled by His wrath. But as for us who believe in Jesus Christ,
   we have love instead of anger--and the sure mercies of David instead of
   wrath--and in this we may rejoice.

   8. You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light
   of Your countenance. And what was the result of that but that they all
   had to die? Their carcasses fell in the wilderness. Oh, if you are a
   Believer in Jesus Christ, this text is not true to you--does not belong
   to you. Here is another that doesbelong to you--"You have cast all my
   sins behind Your back." He has not set them in the light of His
   Countenance, but He has cast them into the depths of the sea and,

   Beloved, you stand acquitted, justified! And yet there may be some here
   who feel their sins, tonight, and know that God is looking at their
   sin. Do you know, dear Friend, there is no hope for you but one? And
   that is written in the Book of Exodus--"When I see the blood, I will
   pass over you." If you do but put your trust in the blood of Jesus
   Christ, God will turn away His eyes from your sins and look upon the
   blood of Jesus Christ! Yes, the blood of Jesus shall blot out your sins
   and you shall rejoice!

   9, 10. For all our days are passed away in Your wrath: we spend our
   years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are threescore
   years and ten, and if by reason of strength they are fourscore years,
   yet is their strength, labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we
   fly away. It is well to have such a sense of our mortality upon us as
   this Psalm suggests. And yet, it is better still to recollect that we
   are immortal--that when we die after the flesh, we shall not die, but
   live in Christ, world without end! Life is cut off and it is like a
   string that holds a bird by the leg--we fly away. Which way? If we are
   God's own, we fly away above yon clouds. We reach the eternal fields
   where we shall sing forever and ever!

   11. Who knows the power of Your anger? Even according to Your fear, so
   is Your wrath. Dreadful is God's anger, indeed. Who knows it? None of
   us do. The lost in Hell begin to know it, but it will need eternity for
   them to learn it all! Oh, I charge everyone here who is unpardoned
   never to attempt to learn what God's anger means! It will be an awful
   lesson, the power of that anger! Why, when it is let loose against a
   man, even in this life, in a measure it crushes him. But what the power
   of that anger must be, who can tell?

   12. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
   wisdom. Count how many days have gone. Will not the time past suffice
   us to have worked the will of the flesh? You cannot tell how few
   remain, but still, if you live to the longest period of life--taking
   that for granted which you may not take for granted--how little
   remains! Oh, that we might, by the shortness of life, be led to apply
   our hearts unto wisdom, so as to live wisely! And what is the best way
   of living wisely, but to live in Christ and live to God?

   13. Return, OLORD, howlong?It is an earnest prayer, full of grief. The
   Prophet of Israel, Moses, was attending one continual funeral. Whenever
   the tribes halted, they formed a cemetery and buried another legion of
   their dead. I do not wonder that he prays, "Return, O Lord, how long?"

   13, 14. And have compassion on Your servants. O satisfy us early with
   Your mercy: that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. If they are
   but few, help us to live happily in them. Grant us the art of Your
   Grace of knowing Yourself, the source of happiness, that we may drink
   ofbliss to the fullest.

   15. Make us glad according to the days wherein You have afflicted us,
   and the years wherein we have seen evil. Give us measure for
   measure--sweets in bounty, according to the bitterness. Surely God has
   done more than this to some of us! We can bless His name because His
   love has abounded and He has made our cup to run over with His
   goodness!

   16. Let Your work appear unto Your servants, and Your glory unto their
   children. We will do the work and the next generation shall have the
   glory. We will be content to wait, plodding on. Jesus will come,
   by-and-by. "Let Your work appear to us--Your Glory to our children."

   17. And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us and establish the
   work of our hands upon us. That if we must go, we may do something that
   will live, that we may not have lived in vain. "Establish the work of
   our hands upon us."

   17. Yes, the work of our hands establish. It is my daily prayer. My
   heart often goes up to Heaven that the work that is done in this place
   may never pass away, but that God would make it such a work of true and
   real Grace, that it may abide until the Lord, Himself, shall come! We
   may expect it if we seek it at His hands. "Yes, the work of our hands,
   establish."

Right-hand Sins

   (No. 3415)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   27, 1868.

   "And if your hand offends you, cut it off." Mark 9:43.

   SALVATION is by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not of works,
   neither can it be procured by human merit. It is the free gift of God
   through the atoning Sacrifice of Christ to every soul that believes.
   But what is salvation? Salvation is, in short, deliverance from sin,
   deliverance from the guilt of it, from the punishment of it, from the
   power of it. If, then, any man is saved, he is delivered from the
   reigning power of sin. It is not possible, therefore, that any man
   should have salvation and yet continue in the indulgence of sin. Jesus
   Christ came to open a hospital for sin-sick souls, not that they might
   remain sick in a hospital but might go out of it healed. He came not to
   take men to Heaven with their sins about them, but to purge them from
   their sins and so make them fit to enter Heaven! Hence, Jesus Christ is
   the severest of all moralists and while He and His followers denounce
   all trust for salvation in merit, they equally declare that no man is a
   saved soul who tolerates any known sin. All the Gospel declares this.
   In all its parts it implies this and that man cannot and ought not to
   consider himself to be saved and cannot truly be said to be saved while
   he lives in the indulgence of evil propensities as he did before. We
   shall not at all, therefore, come into conflict with the Doctrines of
   Grace while we preach to you the strongest claims of Christ upon our
   hearts and lives through His Word. We shall have to urge upon you the
   most strenuous giving up of sin and that which leads to sin--but this,
   not as a means of salvation--but as a result of faith and as an
   evidence that salvation is truly possessed--as the sign and token, the
   proof and the earnest of the good work of the Holy Spirit within the
   soul. We shall begin, therefore, with this short assertion which will
   serve as our first point of thought--

   I. EVERYTHING WHICH OFFENDS GOD OUGHT TO OFFEND US.

   You notice the text says, "If your hand offends you." We might read it,
   "Makes you to offend God." The two expressions ought, in our
   experience, mean the same thing, for everything which offends God does
   offend every truly gracious heart. That short statement will serve as a
   touchstone for us all to know whether we are reconciled to God or not.
   Remember, if you truly love God, it must be so--that that which is
   hateful to Him will be hateful to you. Where two hearts are bound
   together in the bonds of love, they are quite sure to endeavor to
   remove everything out of the way that would cause pain to either. You
   cannot love me if you favor my enemies. You can have no affection for
   me if you delight to thrust before me that which vexes my spirit and
   grieves my heart. True love feels a sympathy with the person loved and
   learns to put away that which is obnoxious. Now say, Heart, do you put
   away from yourself that which God hates? Do you hate it because He
   hates it--not so much because your fellow Christians dislike it, or
   because the public judgment would go against it--but do you hate evil
   because it is detestable in the sight of God? If so, then you have a
   clear mark that you love God and you should be thankful for the Divine
   Grace which has put your heart into such a state.

   Again, if that which offends God offends us, then we may congratulate
   ourselves that there is some degree of conformity between God and us.
   All the saints are to be made like unto God. It was in God's image that
   man was first made-- he lost that image by his sin--but that image is
   to be restored by the work of the Holy Spirit. If you do, even now, in
   your soul war against that which God loathes--if you strive and cry
   after that which God loves--then there is between God and you some
   degree of likeness. You are like He in your hatred of evil--like, not
   in degree, but yet still in substance. You are like God in your love
   towards that which is lovely and good and pure--not like He in degree,
   I say again, yet still in the matter of fact there is some likeness
   between God and your soul.

   Then there is one other thought that ought to cheer you. If you can
   honestly answer this question--If that which offends God offends you,
   then there is some communion between God and your soul--and though it
   may be a questionwith you and you say, "Will God in very deed speak
   with such a one as I am? Will He reveal Himself to His servant and show
   Himself gracious to such a worm as I?"--He has done it and He is
   doingit and this practical proof of His communion is far better than
   half the raptures and the joys which may be but the fruit of men's
   carnal excitement! This solid gold of holiness is full and true proof
   that the hand of the Lord has been laid upon you. Settle this, then, my
   beloved Brother or Sister, in your heart from this day forth! If there
   is a good man in this world, if God loves him, I must love him. If
   there is a good Doctrine preached anywhere, though I may scarcely
   understand it, yet if God loves it, I must believe it and rejoice in
   it! If there is any Providential dispensation that is really of God's
   mind, then let it be of my mind. Oh, Spirit of God, bring me to love
   what God loves, not only to acquiesce in His will, but to rejoice in
   His will! And Lord, teach me to hate what You hate. If there are those
   in this world whose company You would not have, for they blaspheme and
   rail and speak lightly of holy things, help me to shun their company!
   If there is a song that Christ's ear would not hear, let my ears refuse
   to hear it. If there is any sight that a holy God would not gaze upon,
   let not me gaze upon it. May I seek only to love that which would
   approve itself to the pure mind of Christ and to be offended, heartily
   and naturally--without any twisting of myself towards it--at everything
   that is at enmity with God. That stands as the first thought. Now, let
   us pass on.

   II. EVERY SAVED MAN WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE MANY SINS WHICH OFFEND GOD
   WHICH

   MUST BE VERY SUMMARILY DEALT WITH.

   That which offends God, offends the soul. That is the first step. Then
   the next step is--deal with it as an offense, deal with it with vigor,
   deal with it in a summary manner--as the text puts it, "If your hand
   offends you, cut it off." There are sins which are very dear to men. I
   shall not attempt to give a catalog of them. We are so differently
   constituted that the sin which might bewitch you, might not fascinate
   me, and the sin into which I should be likely to fall might not be that
   to which you would be so liable. We all have some besetting sins. We
   may fall into all sins, but some men are more disposed to certain
   offenses than others.

   Now, if you have any wrong thing that has hitherto been dear to you,
   like your right hand, your right eye, your right foot, you are,
   according to this text to deal with it--and to deal with it at once!

   Some sins appear to men to be necessary to them. "What shall I do
   without my right hand?" In certain trades and lines of business, the
   habit of telling white lies, or the indulgence of certain company, may
   seem as if it were absolutely necessary. "How can I get my daily bread
   unless I do such-and-such as others do? We must live," and so on. Well,
   if the thing is wrong, even though it appears to be necessary to your
   livelihood, as the right hand is to the body, yet you are still to deal
   with it, for you and your sins must part, or God and you must part!
   There can be no salvation to one that harbors sin, and if sin is not
   given up, hope must be given up, for into Heaven no man shall come who
   hugs his sins! Some sins, then, are dear and some sins seem useful.

   Some sins, again, seem to be parts of our very selves. "I give up that
   habit?" says one, "If that were relinquished, I should be, indeed, a
   very different man from what I am, but I cannot give it up--it is
   impossible! The Ethiopian might sooner change his skin, or the leopard
   his spots." And yet, Friend, even if it is impossible, it must be done!
   Another power than yours must come to the rescue, for that sin of your
   must go, and the sooner, the better, if you are to be saved!

   Now, observe Christ's word about this right-hand sin which seems so
   dear, so necessary and so much a part of the man, himself. What does He
   say? "If your hand offends you"--strap it up? Well, some have said, "I
   will take a vow not to fall into such a sin as that." "If your hand
   offends you"--secure it within certain bounds and limits, so that it
   shall only act up to a certain extent, but shall go no farther--fetter
   it, chain it? "If your hand offends you"--swathe it in bands, keep it
   from doing mischief? No! But hear the Master's sharp and, at its first
   sound, cruel words--"Cut it off!" In the Gospel according to Matthew,
   He puts it, "Cut it off and cast it from you," as though even after it
   were cut off and the vital union were dissolved, yet still even the
   thought of it becomes detestable! "Cut it off and cast it from you."
   You perceive it is a thorough-going action! It is a vigorous action! It
   is a final action, for, after the man has cut off his hand, he cannot
   put it on again! After he has plucked out his right eye and cast it
   from him, he cannot have it restored again! And after the right foot
   has been cut off, it cannot grow there again. It is a final sentence of
   separation between the man and his sin!

   Now, I put it to some of you, tonight, who have been thinking about
   going to Heaven but you will never get there, while you are what you
   are. You are accustomed to drink, perhaps. Now, it is no use your
   dallying with that sin, saying, "I will keep it within bounds!" Off
   with it, Sirs! And cast it from you! Those pots of yours must be turned
   upside down! The damnable habit must be relinquished, or it will
   certainly be your destruction. It is of no use for a man to say, "I
   have been unchaste but I will keep that sin within limits." There is no
   such thing as keeping the devil in a cage. Cut it off andcast it from
   you! Then there is your pride. It is in vain for you to say, "I will be
   somewhat humble. I will be somewhat resigned," and so on. Cut it off,
   Man, cut it off and cast it from you! It must be thorough work--a clean
   severance between you and sin. Ah, these are hard tidings and many will
   turn on their heels and go their way, and say, "We cannot endure this!"
   But as the Lord lives, the pearly gates can never open to any of you
   who keep your sins. All your iniquities shall be forgiven you--though
   you have blasphemed and have even committed murder, there is pardon for
   you if you hate those sins and leave them--and Christ will help you to
   hate them if you trust Him! He will give you Grace to quit them, but if
   you hug those sins, you may prate about faith in Christ, and you may
   lie about experience in Grace, but to such things as real faith and
   true experience, you are and must be utter strangers unless sin, with
   stern resolution, is given up--not so much as onesin hugged, or
   indulged, or loved. "Must a man be perfect then?" Sir, a man must
   desireto be perfect. "But he cannot be perfect." Sir, he can be perfect
   in intention, if not in fact, and there is a deal of difference between
   the sin of misadventure, and of infirmity, and the willfully wicked sin
   of some men! Alas, there are always men who can excuse their sins by
   the sins of God's people. They eat up the sins of God's people as they
   eat up bread--they make a sweet morsel of it! But the genuine child of
   God, if he sins, hates himself for it. The evil that he would not, that
   he does, but his heart is right. He would do good perfectly if he
   could, and he pants and longs to be delivered from sin. His heart does
   not go after his idols--he has given them up, cast them away, by God's
   Grace and, if he could, he would never take their names upon his lips
   again.

   Let that second point sink deep into the souls of all who would be
   saved. Sins that offend must be given up, and given up at once. Now, in
   the next place--

   III. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH CAUSE US TO OFFEND, and if we are true
   Christians, we shall not hesitate to give them up. Now, I am about to
   address those who are really in Christ Jesus. There are certain matters
   which to Believers are very risky and dangerous, and if they love
   Christ, they must give them up.

   I think I know some who, I trust, are the Lord's people, but they are
   very fond of a certain class of company. There are attractions to them
   in certain pleasures. Now, if they would but look at their own hearts,
   they would find that this company is a snare to them. They are kept
   from weeknight services. They have little zeal for God's Glory. Prayer
   is not kept up as it ought to be, kept up after such meetings as they
   sometimes hold. And yet the society is very fascinating and not
   altogether in itself to be condemned--but the tendencies are, to this
   soul at any rate, exceedingly detrimental. The man is backsliding and
   he certainly gets nothing to help his growth in Grace in that society.
   All he gets there is evidently to the bad and has an evil tendency. Now
   what ought the Christian in such a case do? He ought without hesitation
   to give up such society! I have no right to be constantly found where I
   cannot grow in Grace. I have no right to find happiness in associations
   which are dangerous to my soul, which drive away the Holy Spirit and
   break my communion with Christ. Off with that right hand, then! "Oh,
   but it will seem so painful to give up that society! It would be like
   losing a right hand!" Well, but it would be a grand thing to lose a
   hand for Christ. They are not altogether the most ignoble soldiers who
   come back from battle maimed--no, their scars are their honor--and for
   a Christian to have to sacrifice some dear connection, to have to give
   up standing and position, to receive the cold shoulder, to have the
   wink of the eye, to have the unkind word for Christ should be counted
   for an honor! We should be willing to do and bear it. No, without the
   slightest hesitation, we should feel that there is no connection to be
   compared with communion with Christ, no society for a single second to
   be put in the scales with walking near to Him! And so, off with the
   right hand and stay close to Christ.

   It sometimes happens that things which are right, and good, and
   desirable, may be causes of offense. Yes, there may come a time when a
   man's good name and reputation may have to be given up. I believe that
   a Christian minister had better, once and for all, as soon as ever he
   sets out earnestly preaching the Gospel, make up his mind to give up
   his reputation. It is very hard to be accused of this, and that, and
   the other--some unknown crime to which you were never tempted--to have
   your words wrested and your motives misconstrued! But every faithful
   servant of Christ ought to go in for that, and reckon upon that and
   settle it at first. Mr. John Wesley, I think, once said in the pulpit
   that he had been accused of every crime in the whole catalog of sin,
   except drunkenness, and he did not know that anyone had accused him of
   that--whereas some wicked blasphemer in the crowd accused him of it to
   his face, and Mr. Wesley lifted up his hands and said--"Now this day is
   fulfilled the Word of the Master wherein He said, 'Woe is unto you when
   men shall speak well of you, but blessed are you when they shall say
   all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake and the Gospel's.'"
   Why, in the old times, the old days of the Covenanters, the old times
   of the Puritans, there were found plenty of the followers of Christ who
   would keep close to Him if they could keep their reputations and their
   characters! But those werethe brave men who would be counted the
   offscouring of all things, be set down for fanatics and I know not what
   besides, but who declared that for the Truth of God, for Christ and for
   His cause, they could bear it all! I was reading yesterday the famous
   sentence of excommunication which Cargill declared against Charles the
   Second, in which he cast him out of the Church of God and brought all
   his crimes against him--and went to the block for having done so! He
   and Alexander Petrie and such were known to say that they would die a
   thousand deaths, sooner than admit that any king could be head of the
   Church, or put the crown on any head, except the head of Christ Jesus
   the Lord! In such times, and in other times as well, the most of men
   are cowards--they must keep a reputation--they must not oppose
   themselves too much to popular opinion. They must, if they can, sail
   with the current. Oh, child of God, if your reputation is ever a snare
   to you, off with that right hand of yours and be willing to be called a
   dog or a devil, if Christ can get the greater honor out of you!

   To some professors, their love of profit becomes a snare. I need not
   say many things about that. If there are any profits that you get in
   business that are not honest profits, I charge you before the living
   God, have nothing to do with them! But let the Christian's business be
   conducted with such uprightness that he could afford to have it
   proclaimed as with the sound of a trumpet at the market, for only such
   business is fit for a Christian! So if there is anything about your
   trading that would not stand the test of the most searching
   investigation, cut it off! Cast it from you--what have you to do with
   it, you child of God?

   So, too, with very much besides, which I have not time to mention.
   There are a thousand things we might plead for concerning which much
   might be said, but if these things, though they may be indifferent in
   themselves, should to any of us prove a preventive of our serving
   Christ, they become sins to us. Even if they are allowable to others,
   we have no right to touch these doubtful things. That which is not of
   faith, is sin--that is to say, that which you cannot do, believing it
   to be right, even if it is right, is sin to you. You have got to know
   in your own soul that it is according to the commandment, or else, as a
   child of God, you have no right to touch it, or go near it.

   May I urge upon my dear Brothers and Sisters, the members of this
   Church, to avoid all places where they give Satan the advantage. In a
   battle it is a great thing for a general to fix his position. I do not
   think I should be inclined to often expose myself to the fire of a
   battery across a plain where the shots were constantly flying. And I
   pray you young people, and old people, too, never to be afraid of being
   too precise, but to be afraid of being too lax. This is a day in which
   the stern regulations of the Puritans are cast overboard and, perhaps,
   rightly so, some of them--but let us not go to the opposite extreme,
   but rather when we feel that anything comes to be a temptation to us,
   let us away with it and away with it without a moment's hesitation--off
   with the right foot, the right foot, and out with the right eye!

   One thing there is which I have often to preach a little sermon about
   to myself. There is a tendency in some of us, especially those of us to
   who have heavy constitutions, to have a love of ease--and we have to
   drive ourselves on with a whip to constant industry. But it must be
   done, we must do it! Whitfield used to call out against the gouty
   doctor. That minister who takes things easily will be cursed of God at
   the last. I believe there is no man whose condemnation will be more
   dreadful than that of an easy-living minister. We are bound to be the
   best of men, to spend and be spent in the Master's cause. The love of
   ease is the temptation of many, many Christians. Their love of
   retirement is really indolence. They get into the back ranks of the
   Christian army and enjoy all the good things of the Church out of a
   love of self. I am sure many do. We, ourselves, like spiritual ease. We
   do not like being stirred up too much. We do not like a little
   self-examination. Are there not hundreds of Christians who do not dare
   to look at their own souls? They are obliged to live at secondhand,
   hoping it is all right, but as to a thorough ransacking of their
   spirits, they have not gone through that by the year together! It won't
   do, my Brothers and Sisters! We must cut off this easy kind of
   Christianity. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and only the
   violent will win it! A heart-searching contention against sin--and
   revenge against iniquity in our own souls must be carried out--for men
   will not go to Heaven sleeping! These are not times in which you will
   be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease. He that would win the
   heavenly race must run for it. He that would get to Heaven must fight
   for it. The Lord stir us up and deliver us from this right-hand sin of
   self-confidence and love of carnal ease! The Lord help us to work for
   His cause while we have any strength left, and to rest in the rest
   which He has prepared for us on the other side of Jordan! Now I come to
   a close.

   IV. WHAT ARE THE REASONS WHY THERE SHOULD BE A CUTTING OFF OF RIGHT
   HANDS?

   I shall speak first to you unconverted people about the giving up of
   sin.

   "It is not a very pleasant operation, that of cutting off the right
   hand," says one. "I cannot do it. I do not like that amputation."
   Listen awhile, Man! Did you never have a friend that had a broken leg?
   Did you never go to see him in the hospital? You recollect that the
   doctor told you that the leg would mortify, and when the man heard
   that, what did he say? Did he object to have it taken off just above
   where it was mortifying? He was told that if it were not taken off,
   thewhole body would perish--and was he not very thankful, indeed, when
   the surgeons came and removed the diseasedlimb?

   There may be some here who have even passed through that
   themselves--you were glad enough to lose the arm or leg to save your
   life. But, Man, that sin of yours is a mortified part of your soul,
   your spiritual manhood! It must be given up--it will send mortification
   through your whole self if it is not cut off. Is there anything cruel
   in Christ's demanding that it should be removed? No, it is the dictate
   of generous and kindly Wisdom. Submit yourself to it and ask the Holy
   Spirit to take away your darling sin and make it distasteful to you.
   You will soon die, and if you die with that sin un-repented of, you can
   have no question about where you will go! If you have any question
   about it, our Lord's words that I read to you told you three times over
   that you will be cast "into Hell fire, where their worm dies not and
   their fire is not quenched." I am not going to dwell on those words by
   way of explaining them. What they mean I trust you never may know, but
   if you ever should begin to know, you will continue to know forever and
   ever--"where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched," as
   some say it is. Oh, beware lest you run that risk! Now Man, suppose you
   should keep your cups, keep your bad company, keep your lusts, keep
   your self-righteousness--and find yourself in Hell? It will be poor
   consolation to you! Ah, instead of consolation, it will be another
   tongue for remorse, another tooth for the adder of despair. What? Did
   you sell your soul for that little dance, for that night of revelry,
   for that week's debauchery? What? Would you sell your soul for that
   unchaste delight or for that wild maniac shriek of pleasure? Ah, how
   you will curse yourselves and tear your hair and wish that you had
   never been born, and played the fool so horribly with your immortal
   soul! Let the sin go! Let the sin go! If a man were drowning with a
   golden belt about his loins, and could not swim because the gold was
   heavy, how quickly would he seek to unbind the belt! How gladly would
   he feel it sink in the flood, and himself begin to strike out and swim.
   Man, may God's Grace help you to unbuckle that belt of sin, or,
   pleasure, or whatever it may be--and give up all, that you might swim
   for eternal life through Jesus Christ!

   And now, Christians, this word to you. I have hinted that there are
   some things that you will have to give up in order that you may grow in
   Grace and serve your Master. I will not keep you, but there are two or
   three things I have to say to you. Remember, that what you ever have to
   give up for Christ, it will be sweet to give up, and His precious
   society and approval will be a perfect recompense! No man ever lost by
   Christ in the long run. No, talk of giving up--are not those things
   most our own that we give up to Him? Have we not felt it to be far
   sweeter to drink the gall-cup than to drink the wine-cup if we have
   made the exchange to glorify His name? Ah, if the love is right,
   sacrifice will be the truest gain!

   Besides, reflect--Christians are losers to be gainers. The farmer loses
   his wheat as he scatters it abroad upon the soil, but then he expects
   the harvest. The money that is invested and put out, the merchant has
   it not, but then it is making gain for him and he expects to receive it
   with its interest! So whatever we give up for Christ will come back to
   us with blessed interest in that land where to have been maimed for
   Christ will be nobility, where to have suffered for Christ will enroll
   us among the peerage of the skies, where to have died for Christ will
   make us brightest of the bright, amidst the fair ones, fairest of the
   fair! Oh, never stand questioning and parleying about anything in which
   Christ is concerned, but pray the Holy Spirit to keep you, from this
   day forward, close at the heels of the Master, casting aside every
   weight and every sin that besets you, and every earthly thing that
   attracts you--only desiring His name to be sweet upon your tongue, and
   His praise to be reflected in your whole character! God grant it may be
   so with you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, until Christ comes. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 18:1-22.

   Verse 1. At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
   the greatest in the Kingdom ofHeaven?The question we have sometimes
   heard asked in other forms, "Which is the highest office--which form of
   service shall have the greatest honor?" As if we were courtiers and
   were to take our positions according to precedent.

   2. And Jesus called a little child unto Him and set him in the midst of
   them. They all wondered what He was going to do. The little child was,
   no doubt, pleased to find itself in such happy company.

   3. And said, Verily I say unto you-- "And said, Verily I say unto
   you"--to you men or women who think no small things of yourselves and
   are wanting to know which is greatest--implying that you, each one,
   think yourself pretty good as it is.

   3. Except you are converted and become as little children, you shall
   not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Someone said to me this morning,
   "This is a growing day." "Ah," I said, "I hope we shall all grow
   spiritually." "Which way?" he asked, "smaller or larger?" Let it be
   smaller, Brothers and Sisters--that will certainly be the surest way of
   growth! If we can become much less, today, we shall be growing. We have
   grown up, as we call it-- today let us grow down and become as little
   children, or else we shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven!

   4. Whoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little child, the
   same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. The lower down, the higher
   up! In a certain sense the way to Heaven is downward in our own esteem.
   "He must increase. I must decrease." And when that straight-backed
   letter, "I," which often becomes so prominent, vanishes altogether,
   till there is not an iota of it left, then we shall become like our
   Lord!

   5. And whoever shall receive one such little childin My name, receives
   Me. The humblest and the least in the family of Divine Love, if
   received, brings with that reception the same blessing as the reception
   of Christ.

   6. But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
   Me--It does not mean put him out of temper by his taking his silly
   offense--but shall cause him to sin, shall make him stumble, shall
   scandalize him--whoever shall do that.

   6. It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
   and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.If you have the
   revised version, you will see in the margin that it is a donkey
   millstone--not a common millstone which women used to turn--but a
   bigger stone which was turned by a donkey in a mill which thus was of a
   larger kind altogether. The very heaviest conceivable doom were better
   than to be a stumbling block in the way of the very least of God's
   people. Yet I have known some say, "Well, the thing is lawful, and if a
   weak Brother does not like it, I cannot help it--he should not be so
   weak." No, my dear Brother, but that is not the way Christ would have
   you talk! You must consider the weakness of your Brother--all things
   may be lawful to you, but all things are not expedient--and if meat
   offends your Brother--eat no meat while the world stands! Remember, we
   must, after all, measure the pace which the flock can travel by the
   weakest in the flock--or else we shall have to leave behind us many of
   the sheep of Christ! The pace at which a company must go, must depend
   upon how fast the weak and the sick can travel--is it not so? Unless we
   are willing to part company with them, which I trust we are not willing
   to do. So let us take care that we cause not even the weakest to
   stumble by anything that we can do without harm to ourselves, but which
   would bring harm to them! But I am not sure if it would harm the
   weakest, whether it would not harm us, also, because we are not as
   strong as we think we are. And, perhaps, if we took a better measure,
   we might put ourselves among the weakest, too!

   7. 8. Woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that
   offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offenses come! If your
   hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut them off and cast them from
   you. Get rid of that which is most useful to you, most necessary to
   you, rather than be led astray by it and made to sin!

   8. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than
   having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. Remember
   those are the Words of Jesus--"everlasting fire"--not the words of some
   of those coarse, cruel theologians that you hear a great deal about
   now-a-days, but the Words of Jesus Christ, the Master Himself! You
   cannot be more tender than He! To pretend to be so will only prove us
   to be very foolish!

   9. And if your eye causes you to sin. So necessary to your pleasure, to
   your knowledge and to your guidance, yet if it make you sin--

   9. Pluck it out and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter
   into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into
   Hell fire.Better to be but a maimed Believer than to be an accomplished
   unbeliever! Better to be an uncultured saint than a cultured modern
   thinker! Better that you lose an eye, or lose a hand, than lose your
   faith in God and His Word--and so lose your soul and be cast into Hell
   fire!

   10. Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones.So apt to
   do so, when a man appears to have no perfect knowledge, no large
   pretentions, we are so apt to think, "Oh, he is a nobody!"

   10. For I say unto you, That in Heaven their angels do always behold
   the face of My Father who is in Heaven. There is an angel to watch over
   each child of God! The heirs of Heaven have those holy spirits to keep
   watch and ward over them. These sacred intelligences who watch over the
   people of God, do at the same time, behold God's face! They do His
   commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His Word and beholding His
   face all the while. And if these little ones are thus honorably
   attended by the angels of God, never despise them! They may be dressed
   in fustian, they may wear the very poorest of print, but they are
   attended like princes--therefore treat them as such.

   11. For the Son of Man is come to save that which was lost.Another
   reason why you must not despise them. "What do you think?" Put on your
   considering cap and think a minute.

   12-14. What do you think? If a man has an hundred sheep, and one of
   them is gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and goes
   into the mountains, and seeks that which is gone astray? And if he
   finds it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more of that sheep, than
   of the ninety and nine which went not astray. Even so, it is not the
   will of your Father who is in Heaven, that one of these little ones
   should perish. Nor shall they! Christ has come on purpose that He may
   find them--and find them He will! And having an hundred whom his Father
   gave Him, He will not be satisfied with ni-nety-and-nine, but the whole
   hundred shall be there. Now, as if to show us that we are not to
   despise the very least in the family, nor even the most erring, He
   brings it personally home to us.

   15. Moreover, if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell
   him his fault, between you and him alone. If he shall hear you, you
   have gained your brother. Do not say, "You must come to me." Go to
   him--he has trespassed against you. It is a personal affair--go and
   seek him. It is useless to expect the person who does the injury to try
   and make peace. It is the injuredone who always has to forgive, though
   he has nothing to be forgiven! It always comes to that and it is the
   injured one who should, if he is of the mind of Christ, be the one to
   commence the reconciliation.

   16, 17. But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two
   more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
   Church: but if he neglects to hear the Church, let him be unto you as
   an heathen and a publican. Quit his company. He has despised the last
   tribunal. Now you must leave him. Be not angry with him. Freely forgive
   him, but leave him.

   18. Verily I say unto you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be
   bound in Heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed
   in Heaven. Where the Church acts rightly, it has the solemn sanction of
   God. This lesser tribunal on earth shall have its decrease sanctioned
   by the great tribunal above. Hence it becomes a very serious matter,
   this binding and loosing which Christ has given to His Church.

   19-20. Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth,
   as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of
   My Father who is in Heaven. For where two or three are gathered
   together in My name, there am I in the midst of them. It is not a large
   Church, therefore, that is girded with the wonderful power of prayer,
   but even two or three! Christ will not have us despise one. He will not
   have us despise two or three. Who has despised the day of small things?
   On the contrary, measure by quality rather than by quantity--and even
   if the quality fails--measure by love rather than by some rule
   ofjustice that you have set up!

   21. Then came Peter to Him andsaid, Lord, how often shallmy brother sin
   against me andI forgive him? Tillseven times?He thought he had opened
   his mouth very wide when he said that.

   22. Jesus said unto him, I say not unto you, Until seven times, but,
   Unto seventy times seven. I do not wonder that we read in another place
   that the disciples said, "Lord, increase our faith." For it needs much
   faith to have so much patience and to still continue to forgive.

Shall and Will

   (No. 3416)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 23, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him." Psalm 91:15.

   THIS Psalm is full to the very brim of exceedingly great and precious
   promises, nor is our text the least choice of them all. We have here
   two pearls. I am not sufficient merchantman to be able to say which is
   the more precious, but I am certain that the two put together are
   priceless beyond all computation!

   "He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him." "He shall call upon
   Me." Prayer is, itself, a blessing. The desire to pray, the disposition
   to pray, the resolve, the determination to pray--what hopeful, healthy
   symptoms these are! But to be able to pray--ah, what some might give if
   they could put forth their soul's strength in this cheering exercise!
   Then comes the Divine engagement favorably to hear prayer, "And I will
   answer him." What would some give, especially the lost--those beyond
   the reach of mercy--if they could but hope that their cry of anguish
   could meet with a response of pity! That God would answer them, even if
   it were to relieve, though it might not be to remove their torments! We
   have this privilege. Prayer is encouraged and prayer is answered! These
   two are stars which shine in the Christian's sky, lit up by God to lead
   him to the land where darkness shall be all unknown!

   We have no time for a preface, therefore let us at once notice that
   prayer must be offered--and that prayer must be answered.

   I. THERE MUST BE PRAYER. "He shall call upon Me." It is not said, "I
   will give him this and that without his praying." He that asks
   receives. To him that knocks it shall be opened. He that seeks finds.
   The asking, the knocking, the seeking must come before the
   reception--the opening of the door and the finding. This is God's way.
   "For this will I be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for
   them." Though the promise is good and sure, and will be fulfilled, we
   are to bring it in our hands, lay it before the Throne of God and plead
   with God's faithfulness and mercy that He will do as He has said.
   Prayer is essential.

   The text seems to assert that the man who dwells near to God must and
   shall pray. "He shall call upon me." Others may refuse--man has a will
   of his own, but this will shall not stand in the way or prevent prayer.
   He shall be willing to pray. He shall be made willing in the day of
   God's power. If having received a new heart and a right spirit, his
   will shall be in such gracious order that he shall will to pray! God
   declares that if other men are silent, this man shall pray. This is a
   bell which God will ring! This is a flute upon which God will play.
   This is an organ which shall send forth its peals, for God puts His
   hands upon the keys. This man shall pray!

   Beloved, you who know Christ, who are in the habit of dwelling in the
   secret place of the Most High, you know that there is a constraint upon
   you that you should pray. You are free agents, just as Paul was in the
   matter of preaching and yet he said, "Woe is unto me if I preach not
   the Gospel!" You are free agents in the matter of prayer, and yet do
   you not feel that there is a Divine compelling that moves you, so that
   it is woe unto you unless you draw near to God?

   This necessity springs from divers causes. Within you there dwells the
   Holy Spirit The Spirit of God is a Spirit of intercession. Wherever He
   is, there will be a groaning which cannot be uttered--intercessions
   made within the heart which has become the temple of the Blessed
   Spirit! You cannot help praying if the Spirit of God is in your hearts.
   Drive out that sacred Visitor and you will soon become as dumb as the
   fish in the sea--but while He is there, you shall be like the seraphs
   who continually cry before Him. Your prayer and your praise shall never
   cease, but, like the incense upon the golden altar--it shall always
   smoke--the fire shall never go out by day or by night. The Presence of
   the Holy Spirit secures the fulfillment of this promise, "He shall call
   upon Me."

   Moreover, as the Holy Spirit gradually teaches you and educates you,
   everything that you learn tends to make you pray. I say everything, my
   Brothers and Sisters, whether you read in the illuminated books wherein
   you see the Glory of the Person of Christ, or whether you turn to the
   black-letter volume in which you discover the depravity of your own
   heart. Whichever may be the book, all sacred literature alike shall
   lead you to pray. Certainly a sight of your own heart will do it. You
   will tremble as you see the envy, the pride, the murders, the
   murmurings, the rebellions of every sort that lurk there--and you will
   turn to the Strong for strength, feeling that the monster evils of your
   nature cannot be overcome by your own powers! They have chariots of
   iron, they dwell in cities that are walled up to the skies! You cannot
   drive them out, except a mightier power than yours shall be enlisted in
   the warfare. Hence you will be driven to cry mightily unto the Lord God
   of Israel, that He will put forth His Omnipotence because of your
   impotence to overcome your corruptions and lusts!

   And a sight of Christ--which is the opposite extreme of
   experience--equally instructive and far more pleasant--a sight of
   Christ will bring you to your knees. When Peter's boat was full and
   began to sink, then down he went, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a
   sinful man, O Lord." Sometimes a sense of the weight of sin may make us
   wish to escape from Christ. Sad that it should be so! But when we see
   the Glory of Christ, Himself, and behold His condescension towards us,
   then we come very near to Him and beg Him to abide with us, finding
   arguments in our circumstances to compel Him to tarry yet a little
   longer since we cannot afford to lose his blessed fellowship.

   So, as we learn and grow in Grace, we are sure to grow in prayer! If we
   do not increase in prayerfulness, we may take it as a sign that we are
   not advancing in the Divine Life. I am certain that the closet is the
   thermometer of the entire man. Beloved Brothers and Sisters, how grow
   you if this is the case? How is it with some of you if this is true?
   Oh, how little time is spent upon your knees! Time, however, is of
   small consequence, for I sometimes think we can pray more in five
   minutes at one time than we can in hours at other seasons. Have you had
   personal dealings with God of late? Have you come close to the Most
   High? Have you wrestled with the Covenant Angel? If not, there is
   something wrong. Begin the search! Perhaps under your beloved Rachel,
   your most favored delight, some evil is hidden, some idol concealed.
   Search and look, for if there is a lack of prayerfulness, there is
   mischief somewhere.

   Moreover, dear Friends, not only does the Holy Spirit compel us to
   pray. Not only will all that we learn from Him lead us to prayer, but I
   think the sense of holy joy which communion with God in prayer brings
   will entice us into our retirement. We can look back upon some very,
   very happy times that we have had, when no stranger's foot could
   intrude into the sacred enclosure of our retreat with the Most High.
   Have we not looked into the face of God--a marvelous sight! And have we
   not been made to reflect from our own faces, afterwards, the light of
   His Glory? Have we not spoken to Christ? Why, I dare to say there are
   some of us who have as surely spoken with Him as a man speaks with his
   friend! And it has sometimes become to us scarcely a matter of faith as
   to whether there was a Christ or not, and whether He heard and
   fulfilled our desires, for we have whispered right into His ear and
   have felt Him to be near us. I do not mean with any carnal feeling, or
   under a sense of mere excitement, but in all sobriety, when there was
   no flush of feeling, for we have been heavy of heart with the world's
   troubles, or we have been racked with physical pain. Or at other times,
   when our passions have been subdued by long reading, by searching of
   the Word, or by the exercise of prayer--then in our clearest senses we
   have been cognizant of spiritual things as surely as ever in our lives
   we were conscious of worldly things! Well, now, having once been at
   that table, we long to get there again! Having once sipped of this
   glorious river, we shall never be content with the muddy rivers of
   Egypt anymore! We long for the hour to strike when secular business
   shall be over, that we may begin spiritual business, the real business
   of our souls in commerce with Heaven! We have wished that we could
   prolong the time when we could sit, like David, before the Lord--when
   our spirit could gather such confidence that we could almost dance
   before the Lord as he did when girded with a linen ephod. I am sure
   that the sweetness of prayer attracts and draws the Believer. Even as
   birds are drawn with baits towards the snare, so towards the holy
   exercise of prayer we are drawn by the sweet attractions it has.

   The Lord takes care that His people shall pray by giving them a
   plentiful supply of daily trials and needs. If there is anyone here
   without needs, I can suppose him to live without prayer. And if you
   have had a long course of prosperity, I can easily imagine that the
   Mercy Seat has grown neglected. But it will not be so with those of you
   who have to fight hard for daily bread, or with those of you who have
   many cares in the household, or who have much trouble in your position
   in life by persecution, by ridicule and sneers. Certainly, we who are
   engaged in the business of a large Church with the care of many souls
   upon us, cannot afford to do without prayer. And when we come into
   contact with other people'ssouls, and get to be earnest about them, if
   we did not pray, we would be worse monsters than those that throw their
   young into the depths of the sea, for we should have utterly forsaken
   those who have a call and claim upon us, deserting them in the most
   important of matters, neglecting to make intercession before the Lord
   for them. Surely, we would sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for
   you. You who never look after sinners and do not care whether they
   perish or not, you can live without prayer. But those of you who come
   into contact with the desponding and try to encourage them, and find
   you cannot--you who talk with the despairing and find you cannot
   comfort them--you are driven to God! You call to Him to do what you
   cannot--to perform what you cannot accomplish. I am persuaded that the
   more intelligently active and the more earnestly vigorous a man is in
   God's work, the more will he find the necessity of prayer. I do not
   wonder that Christ spent whole nights in prayer. As a Man, He could not
   have preached and done all He did without it. It would not have been
   possible to have sustained the ardor of such zeal daily, hourly,
   incessantly--without feeding it by nightly, restless, almost incessant
   intercessions! Brothers and Sisters, God will have us pray! And if we
   will not pray by reason of charm, He will force us to pray by reason of
   fear! If we will not pray when the dish is dainty, He will break our
   teeth with gravel and make us drunk with wormwood. If threats will not
   bring you to your knees, trials shall! If one cut of the rod does not
   remind you of your negligence, you shall have stroke upon stroke till
   there are welts upon the skin, till you have smarted, groaned and
   wept--till at length you shall say, "Before I was afflicted from the
   Mercy Seat, I went astray, but now have I kept Your Word and come near
   to Your Throne of Grace." But you shall call upon Him. If you are
   elect, you shall cry unto Him. "Behold, he prays," must, and shall be
   said of you! If you are a quickened soul, you shall pray. You shall not
   be allowed to forget to breathe out your soul unto God! If the Lord
   intends to crown you in Glory, He will make you wrestle in prayer
   before you win that crown! "He shall call upon me." I delight to look
   at the text in this light--not merely as the Christian's duty and
   privilege, but as God's own purpose to make us pray! By the Divine
   influence of His Holy Spirit and by the workings of His Providence, He
   will compel His beloved ones to live near to Him. "He shall call upon
   Me." And now, please, to observe the relative truth-- II. PRAYER WILL
   BE ANSWERED.

   "And I will answer him." If your experience has not got so far as the
   first head, you cannot enjoy the second. If you do not feel the
   propulsions and compulsions of the Holy Spirit compelling you to pray,
   you will have nothing to do with this--"And I will answer him." But if
   you have been much engaged in prayer--then, as there was a necessity
   for you to pray, so there is a necessity for God to answer!

   Let me show you this. It is a part of the Divine scheme and plan by
   which God governs the world and manages Providence that men should pray
   and that He should answer them. I do not know why God is pleased so to
   ordain it, but I do know that this is one of His statutes. In reading
   Scripture, you constantly see evidence of it in precept, in promise and
   in example. Now, when the sun rises, there is light. Why, I do not
   know. There might have been light without the sun and there might have
   been a sun that gave no light, but God has been pleased to put these
   two things together-- sunrise and light. So whenever there is prayer,
   there is a blessing. I do not know why. There might have been prayer
   without a blessing, for there is in the world of wrath. And there might
   have been a blessing without prayer, for it often is sent to some who
   sought it not. But God has been pleased to make this a rule for the
   government of the moral and spiritual universe, that there shall be
   prayer, first, and that then there shall be the answer to prayer. I do
   not expect God to alter His rule about the sun rising. I do not expect
   to see it light in the middle of the night before the sun is up.
   Neither do I expect to see God altering this rule--that there shall be
   a blessing upon the Church without His people seeking it! If we did but
   observe it aright, we would perceive this to be as certainly a rule of
   God's government as any law of Nature which has been discovered by
   experience and embodied in science. And instead of wondering that
   prayer is answered, we would come to look out for and expect answers!
   Some of you good people who have been known to pray for your children
   to be converted, have been not only pleased, which is quite right, but
   you have been amazed, which is quite wrong, when you have seen the
   Divine Grace that was in them and heard their profession of faith in
   Christ! That surprise of yours looks as if you were wonder-struck to
   find that God was honest and kept His Word, whereas you should take
   that as a matter of course. But as this is so reliable, "He shall call
   upon Me, and I will answer him," when you do not get an answer to
   prayer, you should go to the Lord with this question, "Show me why You
   contend with me. What is it that hinders the blessing? Why do You
   withhold it? Is my prayer faulty? Or did I ask amiss? Or have I a wrong
   intent? Or did I not plead the blood of Jesus enough? Or is it that I
   am altogether unfit to receive such a blessing? Whichever it may be,

   Lord, set me right, that I may pray, again, and have given to me the
   answer to my prayer." You ought to get an answer and will get an answer
   because it is a part of the rule of God's government!

   It should be enough for every Believer to know that his prayer will be
   heard because he has God's word for it Why raise objections or multiply
   arguments? We have it before us. "He shall call upon Me, and I will
   answer him." It is no longer a matter of conjecture! God has said He
   will, and "let God be true and every man a liar." Settle it for
   certain, that what God has promised, He can perform--and He
   willperform!

   Has not God always answered prayefi In looking back throughout the
   history of the saints, this seems to be their constant testimony, "This
   poor man cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard him." He has heard
   them in strange places--Jonah, to wit, in the whale's belly! He has
   delivered them, in answer to prayer, out of very difficult positions--
   Peter, to wit, when sleeping with four soldiers to be his guard--and
   yet brought out of prison in answer to the prayers of God's Church. He
   has answered prayer to some of us. We are the living witnesses to this.
   I have sometimes said to skeptics, "You are Believers in the Baconian
   philosophy, by which matters are proved by induction--that is to say,
   certain facts are collated and then an inference is drawn from them.
   Now, as an honest man, I solemnly declare that I have met with not
   twenty, but hundreds of facts, facts certain to me, because they
   concerned myself, in which God has given me what I asked of Him. Who,
   then, are you, that you should say there is no God? Or who are you that
   you should say God does not answer prayer when I, as credible as you
   are, and quite as capable of judging of my own consciousness, and of
   observing facts as you are, state this and that, and when not only I,
   but hundreds of others, reliable people, who, if put into the witness
   box tomorrow, would be accepted by any lawyer as being among the most
   honorable and trustworthy witnesses in the parish--the very men whom he
   would like to get on his side of a case--declare that God has answered
   them? Why are they not to be believed?" Are all the thousands of God's
   people to be put down as fools or fanatics, and a few addle-headed
   infidels to be taken after the estimate of their own conceit, to know
   everything? Well, when the world is turned upside down, perhaps it may
   be so, but as long as things stand as they are and plain evidence
   carries its weight with impartial jurymen, we shall hold to what we
   know, and testify to what we have seen! God does hear! He has heard me!
   He changes not! You may rest assured that if you call upon Him, He will
   answer you.

   Our God compares Himself constantly in Scripture to a Father. ' 'If
   you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
   more shall your heavenly Father give His Holy Spirit to them that ask
   Him? "You do not let our children cry to you for things which you have
   promised them, and then refuse them. Of course, if they take whims into
   their heads they may take them out again. And if they like to cry for
   that which is not good for them, they may cry till they are tired. But
   if they ask for that which you have promised to give them, you give
   them according to their desire. Are you better than your Father in
   Heaven? I think not. He condescends to represent Himself as a Friend.
   Surely one friend will give to another who has need. Is Christ such a
   poor Friend as to deny us our repeated and importunate prayers? He
   calls Himself a Husband. You who have a tender husband's heart would
   not refuse to your bride, your spouse, anything that would give her joy
   that it was in your power to bestow. You know you would not. And do you
   think that the Husband of the Church will let her cry to Him and refuse
   her? Oh, no! He is a model of a husband in the love He has, and He will
   be a model in the generosity with which He proves His love. "He shall
   call upon Me, and I will answer him." The relationships of Father,
   Friend and Husband, all go to prove that an answer shall and will come!

   Were the duty of prayer enjoined, and no promise of answer vouchsafed,
   of what use would it be? Has God enjoined upon us constantly a useless
   observance, and perpetually commanded us to abide in the practice of an
   unmeaning service? He says, "Continue in prayer." "Pray without
   ceasing." Does God delude us and send us to an exercise which can by no
   possibility be profitable? God forbid! We pray because He leads us and
   He bids us because there is an end to be answered by it. Therefore, an
   answer will come!

   If God does not answer prayer, to what purpose is the Holy Spirit given
   to us to make intercession for us? I t were blasphemy to suppose the
   Holy Spirit doing a work of supererogation. Prayer is necessary and as
   we know not what to pray for as we ought, the Holy Spirit
   condescendingly comes to fulfill a useful office in helping our
   infirmities and assisting us to pray.

   Were there no answers to prayer, to what end would be the Mercy Seat?
   It was the central part of the Jewish worship, the most mysterious of
   all their religious furniture--the Ark overshadowed by the
   cherubim--the Mercy Seat, which covered the Law and concealed the
   sacred things. In symbol, or in spirit, the Scripture teaches us it is
   a great privilege to be allowed to come to that Mercy Seat. Christ has
   died to rend the veil, has sprinkled His own heart's blood to make
   itpossible for us to approach without our being struck down for our
   presumption as Nadab and Abihu were. And is all this for nothing? Never
   tolerate such a thought for a single moment! Ah, my dear Brothers and
   Sisters, there is a wonderful reality in prayer. I am afraid that some
   professors have not proved it and those of us who really do know its
   power do not use it as we should. If a man could have, somewhere in his
   house, some little secret spring which, but to touch it, would bring
   him all he needed--which could shake the world, which could move
   Heaven, which could stop the sun and moon if necessary--would you not
   think him insane if he never put his finger on that spring, but let it
   lie idle by him? The insanity is our own! We may move the arm of God if
   we will. There is nothing in earth or Heaven that we may not have, if
   it is really good for us, if we do but know how to be importunate with
   God in prayer for it--and yet we do not pray as if we believed in its
   efficacy! Do you not often find yourselves hurrying through your prayer
   and then going away without ever getting near to God? Depend upon it,
   there is not one more ounce of prayer in the world than there is of
   real dealing with God. That is the measure of prayer. Unless you draw
   near to God and speak with Him, you may use the best language, you may
   think yourselves in the most devout frame, but you have not prayed at
   all! It is getting the grip, spiritually, laying hold upon Him who is
   invisible, talking with Him as a man talks with his friend, ordering
   your cause with arguments and then feeling, "I have really asked this
   of the great invisible God, who has promised to give it, and I expect
   it! I must look out for it, it will surely come--as sure as God is God,
   He will keep His promise--and as He has made me call upon Him, He,
   Himself, will answer me!" This is the essence of true prayer.

   Do I hear somebody saying, "But there are persons who really pray, or
   who think they do, but who do not get an answer.." That is quite true,
   for there are a great many persons who do formally pray, and do not
   truly pray. They offer a dead prayer--there is no life in it. The heart
   is not at work, there is no faith, there is no communion! Now, if a man
   will obtain of God, he must ask in faith, nothing wavering. How can he
   that doubts, expect that he shall be heard? I must believe, if I come
   to God, that God is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him! And if I will not so believe, in vain do I expect to be
   answered!

   But, Brothers and Sisters, do not suppose that prayer will be answered
   in every case according to the impulse of the suppliant, or that God
   will give us just whatever we like to pray for No more dangerous power
   could be committed to mortals! If the Lord would say to me, "I will
   give you whatever you wish for," I should tremble at the
   responsibility! Infinite knowledge, alone, could regulate unlimited
   choice. It were a prerogative not to be entrusted to any but God! Only
   suppose what would occur if every prayer that everybody offers were to
   be answered. It is pretty certain no child of God would ever resign his
   creature life. There would be sure to be something or other that would
   prompt each one to live. We should have all the aged men who lived in
   the days of David still here, as spectators, if not as competitors in
   this world's struggles. I think, too, it is very likely that none of us
   would ever have any trials. We would be sure to pray not to have them
   and then there would be no room for faith to be exercised and no room
   for God to be glorified! The world would come to a dreadful pass if men
   were entrusted with an absolute power to have whatever they liked! It
   would be, indeed, a terrible curse for any man to be put in possession
   of such a faculty as that! You have no right to ask of God what He has
   not promised. Somebody prayed the other day that he might be led to ask
   a person to give him 500 pounds. He was so led, or he said he was, and
   he asked me to do it! All I could say was that whenever I was "led" to
   do it, I would do it, but just then I was not led. Another person was
   led to pray that I might build him a cottage. Well, I was not led. A
   young man was once led, in answer to prayer, to ask me to let him
   preach for me at the Tabernacle. I was obliged to tell him, also, that
   when I had had it revealed to me, as it had been to him, I would then
   cheerfully obey the revelation, but it was lop-sided as yet, and had
   only been revealed to one person, and not to the other! Such fanaticism
   surely grows up where you get the idea that God will give you anything
   you ask for. He will do no such thing! He will give you what He has
   promised to give you, and if in His Word, He has promised to bestow it,
   you have but to ask in faith and He will be as good as His Word! Hold
   to that. If it is not a promised blessing in some form or other, you
   have neither the right to ask for it, nor the right to accept it!

   Should any man say, "I asked for a blessing that was plainly promised,
   but did not obtain it," I should then say, Are you equally clear that
   the obtaining of it would be for your good?' 'Yes," you say, "it would
   make me comfortable." Just so, but is it for your good to be
   comfortable? "And it would get me out of my difficulty." But may it not
   be for your lasting good to be in the difficulty, and may there not be
   something in the world a great deal higher for you and for me than
   merely to be comfortable and to get out of difficulties? "Not as I
   will, but as You will," was the prayer of the Man who had more power in
   prayer than all of us put together--"Not as I will, but as You will."
   We must always put that in. God does not give up His prerogative as
   King when He bids us pray and promises us to answer. He still holds
   everything in His own hands. You say to your child, "My Dear, I will
   give you anything that is for your good." He asks you to let him have
   his father's razors to play with. You know that very soon he will be
   cutting himself, and you say, "No, my Child, that is preposterous." Or
   he asks you to let him have those sweets that are poisonous and you
   say, "No, my dear Child, I have no doubt they taste sweet to your
   palate, but think of the bitter medicines you would have to take
   afterwards, and of how much mischief they would do you. No, I cannot
   let you have those." So it is with our God. He denies us many things we
   wish for because they are not good for us. But there is one thing that
   is certain--"No good thing will He withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." If it is really good for you, you shall have it and God
   shall be glorified byit!

   To sum up all I have been saying tonight, I want, dear Friends, these
   two promises to stand vividly set forth before your eyes--"He shall
   call upon Me, and I will answer him." I want to stir you up to prayer.
   Do let us have more prayer during this year than we have ever had. It
   has been by prayer that we have been established up till now. When we
   were very few at Park Street, before I had the pleasure of knowing the
   most of you, among the best signs of the coming blessing was your
   numerously-attended Prayer Meetings. We had a little vestry there and I
   think we tried it about twice but it was no use--we could not get in,
   but we must needs go into the Chapel. Oh, there were prayers there that
   have been turned into answers since! There were many times when we
   could not speak because we felt so much of the Presence of God that we
   had need to sit still and pour out in tears and sobs the groans that
   could not be uttered. We did pray with real, mighty, prevailing
   prayer--and then there came a blessing. Wherever we went, God was with
   us! Wherever the Word was preached--whether in Exeter Hall or the
   Surrey Music-Hall--it mattered not in what place--the Word was blessed!
   And though I am sometimes afraid that we shall get slack in prayer, yet
   when I frequently see the whole of this basement full, and see you
   sitting in the aisles on Monday evening (though some careless people
   say, "Oh, it is only a Prayer Meeting!"), it does cheer and make glad
   my heart. We cannot lose the blessing while we keep the spirit of
   prayer! I want you to pray still more. Among other topics, I suggest to
   you much more prayer for your children and for your families. We must
   have them saved, Beloved. We cannot bear it that our children should be
   cast away! The angel said to Lot, "Have you here any beside?" I say
   that to each of you tonight. Have you in London any beside? You have
   seen some saved--are there any left? Is there one left? Oh, Father,
   never cease to pray till that one child is brought to God! Let your
   prayers go up perpetually, "Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!"
   When you have done with your families, pray for your neighbors. You
   need never be short of objects for petition in this great city which is
   so full of sin! In these times of poverty and distress, men, perhaps,
   are more easily reached than they ever were. Let us pray more for them
   and may the Eternal God soften them in their distress and bring them to
   Himself. I claim myself to have a very special right to the prayers of
   some here. I think I have a right to the prayers of all the members of
   this Church, but on some of you in particular I have a claim which none
   can dispute, for it has been through the Word preached here that you
   have been brought from darkness to the Light of God, and I charge you,
   my children in Christ, by the love which I trust subsists in your
   hearts, never forget me in your prayers! You know not how much I need
   it. It is not possible for any but God to know how much I need the
   daily prayers of the Lord's people! Others of you are members of other
   churches. Well, pray for your ministers and pray for us all. The
   weakest of us will be strong when you pray! The strongest will grow
   weak when you flag. Brothers and Sisters, pray for us that we may be
   faithful, earnest, useful! And we say, as you shall pray for us, so may
   God help you in that day when you shall draw near unto Him for
   yourselves in distress. Pray for all your fellow Church members. Pray
   for the backsliding, pray for any that are faltering, pray, I beseech
   you, for our work connected with the Church here. I ask your prayers
   for our college, in particular, that our Brothers who are going out to
   preach the Gospel may go as God-sent servants, having their feet winged
   with love and their souls fired with zeal!

   Again and again, and again would I say it! If I should never say
   another word to you, I think I would conclude by saying. Brothers and
   Sisters, pray for us! Pray for yourselves and your families and your
   neighbors! "Continue in prayer." "Watch and pray." Watch continually,
   but pray, also, and the Lord hear you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW5:41-48; 6:1-8.

   Verse 41. And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.
   If you can do him any service, do it cheerfully, do it readily. Do what
   he wants of you.

   42. Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you,
   turn not away. This is the spirit of the Christian--to live with the
   view of doing service.

   43-46. You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your
   neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies,
   bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
   them which despitefully use you and persecute you. That you may be the
   children of your Father who is in Heaven; for He makes His sun to rise
   on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the
   unjust For if you love them who love you, what reward have you?You have
   done what anybody would do.

   46-48. Do not even the publicans do the same? And if you salute your
   brethren, only, what do you more than others? Do not even the publicans
   do so? Be you, therefore, perfect, even as your Father who is in Heaven
   is perfect Rise out of ordinary manhood. Get beyond what others might
   expect of you. Have a high standard. "Be you, therefore, perfect, even
   as your Father who is in Heaven is perfect."

   MATTHEW 6:1-8.

   Verse 1. Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of
   them: otherwise you have no reward from your Father who is in Heaven.
   Our blessed Lord does not tell His disciples to give alms, but He takes
   it for granted that they do. How could they be His disciples if they
   did not do so? But He tells them to take care that they do not do this
   in order to get honor and credit from it. Oh, how much is done in this
   world that would be very good, but it is spoiled in the doing through
   the motive done to be seen of men! "You have no reward from your Father
   who is in Heaven."

   2. Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you,
   as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they
   may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
   So that they will never have another! They have been paid once for it
   by the approbation of their fellow men. They will never have any
   further reward.

   3-5. But when you do alms let not your left hand know what your right
   hand does: that your alms may be in secret: and your Father who sees in
   secret, Himself shall reward you openly. And when you pray--He does not
   tell His disciples to pray, but again takes it for granted that they
   do--and he cannot be a Christian who does not pray. "A prayerless soul
   is a Christless soul." "When you pray"--

   5. You shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray
   standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they
   may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.All
   they will ever get. People say, "What a wonderfully pious man he is to
   pray up at the street corner." Yes, but that is the reward. The prayer
   will die where it was offered.

   6. But you, when you pray, enter into your closet Get into some quiet
   nook--some secret place--no matter where. 6. And when you have shut
   your door So that nobody can hear you--not wishing anybody to know even
   that youare at prayer. "When you have shut your door."--

   6-8. Pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in
   secret, shall reward you openly. And when you pray, use not vain
   repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think that they shall be
   heard for their much speaking. Be not you therefore like unto they, for
   your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.
   Prayers are never measured by the yard in Heaven. They are estimated by
   their weight. If there is earnestness in them--truth, sincerity--God
   accepts them however brief they are. Indeed, brevity is often an
   excellence in prayer. Let us never, therefore, use vain repetitions.

Our Youth Renewed

   (No. 3417)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING FEBRUARY
   24, 1870.

   "Who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is
   renewed like the eagle's." Psalm 103:5.

   IN this delightful Psalm, one remarks how David finds something of
   praise within him in everything of which he thinks. There are some
   desponding, morbid, murmuring, ungrateful souls who find reasons for
   complaining everywhere, but a man of David's spirit, on the contrary,
   sucks honey out of every flower and praises God in connection with
   everything! I noticed, while I was reading just now, how many of these
   things would have made others mourn, but they only called forth from
   David's soul, songs of praise! For instance, "Who forgives all your
   iniquities"--some would be forever complaining that they had sins and
   that those sins were a burden, but David sings of sin as pardoned! Some
   would be mourning before God that they were not well in health,
   complaining of their sicknesses, but David sang of Him, "Who heals all
   your diseases." Morbid minds will be fretting about death and about
   what might come after death, but David says, "Who redeems your life
   from destruction." And now, in the view of his temporal and spiritual
   blessedness, he pens this verse with which to crown his song, "Who
   satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed
   like the eagle's."

   I invite you first notice in this verse and as you notice, ask that you
   may enjoy-- I. SATISFACTION.

   David speaks of his mouth being satisfied with good things.
   Satisfaction. A rare word! It rings like a silver bell-- satisfaction.
   The richest man in England has not found it. The greatest conqueror has
   never won it. The proudest Emperor cannot command it. Satisfaction! It
   is no more natural to man than it was to the horseleech to cease from
   craving and crying for itself, "Give! Give!" As well might the sea be
   thought to be full or its billows to be still, as the heart of man to
   be thought to be satisfied! It is a spiritual blessing--it is a Divine
   Grace that comes from the great satisfying God--the God who is,
   Himself, All-Sufficient, is the only One who can be sufficient to fill
   the heart of man. Satisfaction! Why, that means enough, and enough is a
   feast!

   David had enough of temporals and so, I trust, have we. If we are of
   the Apostle's mind, we have, for having food and raiment, we are
   therewith content. David had spiritual riches and that satisfied him,
   and so have we, for if we have Christ, we have all things, for, first,
   Christ is All and next, He that spared not His own Son, but freely gave
   Him up for us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely give us all
   things? For all things are yours, whether things present or things to
   come; all are yours and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. You have
   enough, then, for you have all things! Your spirit is content with what
   it has--no, more than content--you can say with David, "My cup runs
   over." In receiving Christ into your soul, you have received more than
   your soul can hold--you are filled with all the fullness of God!

   The text, in speaking of satisfaction, uses terms which denote
   satisfaction."Who satisfies your mouth with good things." In the mouth
   is the palate. It is the place in which there is a sensuous kind of
   enjoyment, which is here put as a figure of a higher and spiritual
   delight. We do not merely receive God's good mercies--we enjoy them! We
   have not lost our taste for them. We do not swallow the honey of the
   Divine Mercy as though it were so much tasteless white of an egg, but
   we know, through having our senses exercised and taught of the good
   Spirit, how to get the flavor, the taste of the Word and to enjoy it.
   "He satisfies your mouth." We have, all of us, desires after pleasures
   which are natural to us, but believing men have desires after higher
   pleasures--and these desires are, for the time being, satisfied until
   we get into yonder realm where our capacities are enlarged, our desires
   shall be increased and there, too, we shall be abundantly satisfied
   with the fatness of His house, and shall drink of the river of His
   pleasures forevermore! Until then, we are satisfiedwith Christ,
   satisfied with His salvation, satisfied with the Holy Spirit, satisfied
   with all His gracious operations, satisfied with the Covenant of Grace,
   satisfied with its sureness, satisfied with the largeness of its
   provisions, satisfied with the love of God, satisfied, indeed, with all
   that the Lord wills, for we can say that His will is our will! There is
   enough, then, and there is enjoyment of that enough.

   Note as you take the words, "Who satisfies your mouth with good
   things." See the variety of the satisfaction that is given. The mercies
   bestowed are not only good--they are not a good thing--but '"good
   things." The Christian's spiritual wealth consists of all manner of
   good things. As we showed you last Thursday night--of Christ's fullness
   have all we received, and Grace for Grace. He gives more Grace. He is
   the God of all Grace. All sorts of blessings are provided for the
   Believer and the satisfaction which he enjoys is the result of
   receiving all the blessings that he can ever need. "He satisfies your
   mouth with good things," that is, with pardons bought with blood, with
   justifying righteousness, perfect and complete--with adoption and all
   the privileges belonging thereto--with sanctification and all its
   gracious results! Good things, superlatively good things, Beloved! Not
   merely on good doctrines and good opinions shall you feed, but on real
   things, real blessings, and these not all of one sort, nor after one
   fashion, but like the fruit of that tree which becomes near to the
   Throne of God, and which bears its fruit every month, and has a variety
   of fruits to suit the tastes of all who come hungering to eat thereof!

   The excellence also of the mercy which satisfies us is mentioned in the
   text. "Who satisfies your mouth with good things"--emphatically good.
   Many of "the good things of this life," as we commonly say, are only
   good in a very modified sense. They are easily made into curses and
   they often become temptations. But the good things of Divine Grace are
   so good that they never can be anything else but good, and so good that
   they make our bad things good! I mean that they make our bitter
   affliction sweet and turn our trials into joys! He that gets Christ has
   such a good thing that no tongue shall ever tell the goodness it. He
   that gets everlasting love and all the streams that gush from that deep
   and fathomless fountain, gets things so good, and in the most
   superlative sense of that word, that they are like God, Himself, who is
   essentially good. Ah, Christian, what a happy lot is yours! To have
   good things from the good God and to have an abundance of them, and to
   have yourself so ravished in the enjoyment of them that your soul can
   say, "I am satisfied! It is enough. I am content. My soul is
   overflowing with the good things of God!"

   Once more, this satisfaction is continual The word is in the present
   tense, "Who satisfies your mouth with good things." It is not, "did
   satisfy it," though that is true. He did satisfy my mouth with good
   things when first I came to Him and perceived the beauty of my Lord
   Jesus. Often since then has He made His servant to sit at the banquet
   table and there, in the presence of his enemies has he been fed. But
   the text is in the present and that means who nowsatisfies, who,
   to-morrow when it comes, shall still be your present help and still
   shall satisfy--who not only will satisfy you in Heaven--though that is
   true, for I shall be satisfied when I awake in His likeness--but who
   even now, as far as your capacity goes, continually satisfies you in
   things here below, not with things below, but with things
   above--satisfied with God while yet absent from the Lord. Is not this
   blessing, being in the present tense, peculiarly delightful? But it is
   just that to which the worldling cannot come! All his good things are
   generally in the past or the future. I mean his good spiritual things.
   He will tell you of what he once felt, or else he hopes that they may
   yet be in the days to come, and that one of these days he may be saved.
   But the genuine religion of Christ is known by its bearing the motto of
   "Today"--present salvation! There is no religion under Heaven except
   the evangelical Truth of God that teaches present salvation!

   I think I have read some such passage as this by an eminent cardinal,
   since departed, and gone somewhere--I do not know where, for he has
   gone somewhere where they have "Masses" for the repose of his soul, and
   surely that cannot be in Heaven! Surely, they would not need to pray
   for the repose of the souls that are there! But this departed cardinal
   says something like this--"How delightful to die after having received
   the saved viaticum from the hands of God's priest, with the memorial of
   the cross upon your bosom and the crucifix upheld by holy hands before
   your expiring eyes! To pass out of this world with the sound of the
   passing bell in your ears and then to lie awhile, while gathered round
   you are the prayers of holy men and blessed virgins consecrated to God
   in the neighboring convent. To be carried out with the songs of
   choristers, with the perfume of incense and with attending monks and
   friars. To be put into holy ground, consecrated by sacred rites, amidst
   the reading of words long honored by being used by the Holy Catholic
   Church--to have the consecrated earth saturated with holy water falling
   upon the coffin lid that bears the memorial of the cross," and so on,
   and so on, and so on. How delightful! How delightful he makes it all
   out to be, as if it all were a theater--nothing more--a piece of show!
   What good could there be to a soul in all that performance, and all
   that tag raggery and I know not whatbesides? What consolation could it
   be to a departing spirit? But that evidently is the ultimatum, the
   highest reward that can be obtained by that kind of faith!

   But, Beloved, we speak out of this Book of God what we know and have
   proved! And we tell you that you may be saved NOW! The pardon of sin is
   not a thing merely for dying moments-- it is a thing for this very
   present hour! What says David? "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
   imparts not iniquity; blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and
   whose sin is covered." What says Paul? "There is, therefore, now no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
   flesh, but after the Spirit." I dwell then, with a lingering delight
   upon the present tense of these words, "Who satisfies"--today--"your
   mouth with good things"--makes you even now a happy Believer, a
   rejoicing Believer, a hopeful Believer, a contented child of God,
   looking for the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ and hoping to be
   found among the waiting, worshipping company who "worship Christ Jesus
   in the spirit, and have no confidence in the flesh." That is the first
   thought of the text, then--satisfaction. Pass on now to the second
   thought, which is-- II. RENEWAL.

   "So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's." Beloved, there is
   need of this. Every Christian has need that his soul should be
   restored--should be refreshed, re-invigorated, newly quickened. As to
   those who are saved, there is a constant need restoring them to their
   first love. This is promised in the Words before us. I say there is
   need of it. There is need of it, first, because of the ordinary wear
   and tear which operate upon spiritual life, as well as upon every other
   form of life. You cannot serve God, you cannot praise, you cannot pray,
   you cannot do anything without some expenditure of strength and,
   therefore, you need to have that strength renewed. Moreover, in such a
   world as this, combating with temptations, bearing up against the
   current of society, and I know not what besides, of difficulty, takes
   away our strength. We need, therefore, to go and drink again of the
   brook by the way, that we may lift up our head once again. The ordinary
   wear and tear of spiritual life requires renewal. Besides that, we are
   often the subjects of sinful decline. Backsliding is too common a
   complaint among Christians. We can ascend to the top of the mountain
   and dwell with God, but our foot soon begins to descend. There is a
   gravitation towards sinfulness in the best of men. Oh, that it were not
   so, but we are very conscious that it is so and, therefore, we need to
   have the renewal.

   And yet again, we sometimes fall into sorrowful spiritual diseases. I
   mean apart from sin. We may get depressed in spirit. We may be nervous,
   fearful, timid. We may almost come to the borders of despair. We may
   cry out with David, "All Your waves and Your billows have gone over me,
   my heart is consumed because of grief." We may be brought very low.
   Well, then, again we shall need renewal. So, what with wear and tear,
   what with sinful inclination to decline, and what with the sorrowful
   diseases which may come upon our mind, we often need renewing. Mark,
   now, the peculiar excellence of the renewing that is spoken of in the
   text. David says, "So that your youth is renewed." There is great deal
   to be admired in the youth of the Believer. Youth is the time of
   beauty. After a while, the furrows are plowed upon our brow, and the
   gray hairs are scattered here and there, but the young man and the
   maiden rejoice in the beauty of their youth. And I am sure it is
   beautiful to see a young Christian. There is something so admirable in
   his carriage and bearing, in his first ardor his, first love and zeal,
   his first jealous sensitiveness and tenderness of heart, his
   carefulness of walk and so on, that we cannot but admire him! But thank
   God, we need not give up these things when our Christian youth, as to
   time, has gone! Thank God, He can renew our youth to us spiritually
   when we grow old bodily! And there is a beauty about the aged Christian
   who is living near to God and dwelling on the borders of Heaven, quite
   as fair to look upon as the beauty of the young Believer! So God gives
   to His people from day to day a peculiar beauty in each season of
   life-- and thus their youth is renewed!

   Youth, again, is the time for vigor The young man can run. He is
   strong. He has even waste powers to throw away! And often how strong
   are the young men in Christ Jesus! They are strong and have overcome
   the Wicked One. Alas, it sometimes happens that growth in years does
   not bring growth in Grace--and we have known some who have grown weak
   and feeble as years have passed over their heads. But God can renew to
   us all the vigor we ever had! All the strength we had for service
   during the first 20 years of our Christian life, He can bring back to
   us again! Though we may have been living under a starving ministry, and
   so have lost our strength. Though we may have neglected much communion
   with Christ, and so have lost our vigor, He can give it all back again,
   and once more we shall run, and not be weary, we shall walk and not
   faint! Youth, again, is the time for ardor, for fervency, for
   enterprise. I would not say a word that might depreciate the wisdom and
   mature prudence of old age, but for all that, the most of things that
   are done in theworld must be done by the young blood. The radical
   element comes in to stir the conservative element and quicken it into
   activity. In the Christian Church there must be young blood coming in,
   and if there is not, it is generally an ill time with that Church. But
   surely, Beloved, it need not be that our first ardor, and enterprise,
   and hopefulness should leave us. God can renew it to us at any time
   during our spiritual career. He can renew our youth like the eagle's by
   renewing our courage for Him, our confidence in Him, our energy towards
   Him, our determination for Him, our willingness to run risks in His
   cause, our ardor to tell to others what Christ's love has been in our
   hearts. If you have lost that youth, cry to God tonight for it and He,
   by His Spirit, will renew your youth to you! "Even the youths shall
   faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fail. But they that
   wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with
   wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk and
   not faint." Youth, too, is the time for joy. We expect young people to
   be merry, and young Christians may well make merry and be glad, now
   that they are brought into the house of feasting. God often makes the
   early part of our Christian career to be smooth--He screens us from the
   harder trials that will be necessary for us afterwards--but there is no
   reason why the joy of the Lord should ever depart from a Christian.

   I have not known many, but I have known some few Christians who are
   just as happy and joyful as they ever were in the brightest period of
   their lives and have continued so by the twenty years together! I do
   not believe that spiritual decline, though it is very common, is at all
   inevitable. I believe it to be as unnecessary as it is sinful. We might
   always retain that early joy and delight. I must confess my own
   experience is that whatever joy I had in Christ 20 years ago, I have
   much more, now. Whatever I had that could delight me concerning Him was
   shallow and superficial, then, compared with the deeper delight my
   spirit finds in His service, in His work, in His people and especially
   in Himself! There is no reason why we should not continue to be young.
   A dear friend of yours who has lately gone to Heaven, who was close on
   the verge of 80 years, and whom you all knew well, why, he was as much
   a boy as any of us in the things of God! There was not one among us
   that was more hopeful or more enterprising than was our dear venerable
   father. We had only just to think of any good thing for Christ, and
   instead of being, as some have a tendency to be when they get old,
   rather inclined to be a drag on the wheel for fear lest the young
   people should go too fast, he was always ready to gird up his loins and
   run like Elijah before the chariot, and do a little more than anybody
   else if he could! I pray that that may be our case--that we may bring
   forth fruit in old age to show that the Lord is upright! So may it be
   with us, and right on as long as ever we shall live may He renew our
   youth like the eagle's! I shall now need your attention for only a few
   minutes for a third point. We have had satisfaction and renewal. The
   third thing in the text is--

   III. A SIMILITUDE.

   "So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's." How is that? Socrates
   and the old naturalists used to say that when eagles get to be very
   old, they lost their old beak and talons, and feathers, and turned
   young again. I suppose people used to believe that in those times, but
   happily there is nobody who believes such rubbish as that now! I am
   quite sure that David did not believe it, for my persuasion is the more
   I look into the Bible, though some have said that the Bible was only
   meant to teach us religion and that we must not look for accuracy as to
   scientific facts, that that is a mistake--and that the Bible never
   makes a mistake in natural history, in physics, or in anything else--is
   as much Inspired about one thing as about another! There is nothing in
   this text to lead us to believe that David meant that--nothing at all!
   Some have thought and I think they are correct, that the allusion is to
   the newly-molting of the eagle. As with every other bird at that time,
   they appear haggard, and then when their feathers are grown again, it
   makes them appear to renew their youth. I observe that many naturalists
   whose works I have consulted on the subject declare that the molting of
   the eagle is not sufficiently severe to produce any appreciable change,
   and that David must have been a very acute observer, indeed, if he
   could have detected such an alteration, and they seem to think that the
   allusion is to the well-known longevity of the eagle, which lives on,
   and on, and on, when many other birds have passed through many
   generations. The grand old monarch of the craggy rocks is still young
   when generations of other birds have passed away. So our youth is
   renewed like the eagle's--that is to say, our spiritual life continues
   on, and on, and on through time--right into eternity!

   Let me, then, conduct your thoughts to the eagle for a minute. How is
   the eagle's youth renewed? I suppose in four things--in its sight, its
   flight, its might and its fighting.

   The eagle has a keen eye, but its eye would grow dim unless there was a
   constant renewal of its youth and, therefore, its eyesight is renewed.
   The eagle-eye belongs to every gracious man. He can see farther than
   the eagle can. He can see beyond the gates of pearl--he can see farther
   than that--to the Throne of God! Yes, farther than that--into the heart
   of God. He can say--

   "The streams of love I trace Up to their fountain, God. And in His
   mighty breast I see Eternal thoughts of love to me."

   But the eagle eye of faith is often clouded with unbelief, and it is a
   blessing for us that God increases our faith and that, once again, we
   can see invisible things and rejoice to behold what has never been
   given to mortal eye to see.

   The eagle is a bird of strong flight, and that flight may be reckoned
   as a part of its youth which is renewed. Large as it is, sometimes
   measuring from six to eight feet broad when its wings are outspread,
   yet as soon as it vanishes out of sight it is lost in the blaze of the
   sun. At another time the eagle is on its flight, simply making
   progress. So with the Christian. His youth is renewed. He mounts
   upwards in communion with God, higher, higher, higher. His motto is--

   "Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee! This still my cry shall be--
   Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee!" Up he mounts like the eagle, or at
   other times he goes onward in his Christian pathway, going from
   strength to strength until he appears before his God. Now, it is a
   mercy for us that the Lord is pleased to renew our power of fellowship
   with Himself--our power of making progress in the Divine Life--just as
   He renews the eagle's youth.

   The eagle has great power and might, too. He had need to be strong, or
   when he carries his prey to his young ones, he might soon weary. And
   you and I have souls to feed, and work to do for God and for His
   Kingdom--and we need that our might should be renewed, like the
   eagle's, that we may be strong for every service imposed upon us.

   And then the eagle is made to fight. It smells the battle afar off and
   delights in carnage. And the Christian, though he is a man of peace, is
   also a man of war. From his youth up he has to contend with his
   corruptions and fight with spiritual wickedness in high places! And he
   needs that his power to fight should be daily renewed, even as is the
   eagle's. May we experience day by day what it is to have our youth
   renewed in these respects. But, now, let us ask the pressing and
   practical question, how is it that the eagle's youth is renewed? Is it
   not because there is a life within which renews it?God has so
   constituted the eagle that it shall live on--God has so constituted a
   Believer that he shall live on. He has put a living, incorruptible seed
   within us that cannot die, and the Water of Life that He has given to
   us, is in us a well of water springing up unto everlasting life!
   Therefore is our youth renewed like the eagle's. There is a holy
   nature, a spiritual immortality of Grace bestowed upon us and,
   therefore, is our youth renewed.

   The eagle's strength is renewed by the food it eats. That is indicated
   in the text, "Who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your
   youth is renewed like the eagle's." When the eagle has satisfied his
   hunger, he is strong again and when you and I have fed upon the Word of
   God--especially upon the Incarnate Word of God--when we have been
   privileged to eat His flesh and drink His blood, as spiritual men know
   how, ah, then again, our youth has been renewed!

   The eagle's strength is renewed by the air he breathes. Not here below,
   in this smoky atmosphere, but up there, in the clear azure, where all
   is bright--there does the eagle breathe the pure air and thus renew his
   strength. So the Christian renews his strength, not here among
   groveling gold hunters or pleasure hunters, or fame hunters, but up, up
   there in the rarified atmosphere of communion with God! There he grows
   strong, again, and comes down from the Heaven of heavens with his face
   glowing with the radiance of renewed youth, renewed by breathing the
   atmosphere of the skies!

   The eagle's youth is renewed as the season returns, or, if the
   reference I gave to some naturalists is correct, there is a season for
   renewal. So when the times for God's Spirit to visit us with times of
   refreshing come, then, and our strength is renewed. When we feel once
   more the Holy Spirit bedewing us and our heart gets to be like Gideon's
   fleece and we are saturated, then, like the eagle's, our strength is
   renewed!

   But I shall weary you, for there is so much scope here, if I continued
   to speak. I shall rather leave you to think the matter over than
   attempt to work out the fullness of such a text as this. And thus I
   must bring you to the last Truth of God which I desire to enforce--

   IV. A DIVINE QUICKENER.

   Does not David say, " Who s atisfies your mouth with good
   things"?--referring here to God, Himself. To make short work of this
   last point, let me say to every Believer here who has been satisfied,
   who has had Grace restored to him and his youth renewed like the
   eagle's--you have had all this from God! You have never had your soul
   renewed from anywhere or anyone else but from Him! You have never had
   your mouth filled with good things except by God. Every temporal mercy
   has His mark upon it, for He sent it. Those houses, those children,
   that competence of yours--all came from Him. As to every
   piritualblessing, you must see His mark thereon--

   "There's never a gift His hand bestows,

   But cost His heart a groan."

   Well, it all comes from God! Then remember that and let it be all the
   dearer to you! Let it make your soul cling still closer to God to think
   that all these blessings have come from Him.

   Well, then, if all has come from God, be it remembered with that fact
   that all has been through God. From Him and through Him--I mean that no
   mercy would have been a mercy if God Himself had not made the
   mercy--and that no spiritual gift could have been yours unless God
   Himself had been in the gift! In fact, there is no good thing until you
   get God Himself--

   "Less than Yourself cannot suffice, My comfort to restore."

   Life is nourished, not so much by bread, as by God's decree that bread
   should nourish us, for, "man shall not live by bread, alone, but by
   every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live." So
   the ordinances do not feed your soul, it is God IN the ordinances! It
   is not the sacramental bread and wine. It is not Baptism. It is not
   coming up to listen to a poor mortal like ourselves. It is not even
   private prayer--it is God IN the prayer, God IN the preacher, God IN
   the ordinance, so that you not only have everything from God, but that
   which satisfies and renews you is God Himself! Oh, to say, "My Lord and
   my God: the Lord is the portion of my soul!" This is sweetness, indeed.

   Well, then, as you get everything from God, and by God, ascribe
   everything to God. Let nothing pass by without praise. Reckon that
   nothing comes to you by chance. Do not conclude anything to be your
   desert or your earning. Bless God for it all! "Oh, clap your hands, all
   you people. Come into His courts with thanksgiving. Praise Him with
   cymbals, even the high-sounding cymbals." Let Him have the best of your
   songs, for you have the best of His gifts. Praise Him with a new song,
   for you have new mercies for which to sing.

   And if you thus ascribe everything to God, take care that you use
   everything for God. Let your temporal mercies be consecrated to Him.
   Give Him the first fruits of all your increase, so shall your barns be
   filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst with new wine. Give to
   God all your spiritual strength and whenever you feel that you are
   renewed in it, do not shake yourselves as though your strength were
   your own, and you might use it as you like--but when the Spirit of the
   Lord moves upon you as He did upon Samson in the camp of Dan, go out
   and smite the Philistines as he did. Go and help in the Master's work
   and the Master's children--watch over the Master's sheep, fight the
   Master's foes and thus shall you continue to have your mouth satisfied
   with good things and your youth renewed because the Lord will see that
   you are not wasting it, or spending it upon yourselves, but giving it
   all to Him.

   I am sure I grieve much that such a text as this should not have a
   bearing upon you all. But alas, there are some here, there are some
   here who are notsatisfied and you never will be, my dear Hearer, till
   you get Christ! There are some here whose youth is not renewed. No, it
   were a pity that it should be. You must be born-again! You must, you
   MUST be born-again! Oh, that you may now be born-again, for otherwise
   for you to renew your youth would be to renew your sins and increase
   your ruin! My dear Friend, what you need most is a new heart--and there
   is only One who can give it to you, and that is He who made Heaven and
   earth, even Christ Jesus! What you need is to have your sins washed
   away and it is only He who can do it, who first filled the channels of
   the deep and who now can wash away your sins in His own blood. Trust
   Him and it is done! Trust Him and it is done altogether. Trust Him and
   it is done altogether and forever! He that believes in Him is saved,
   for He who cannot lie has said it, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." Be obedient to that double command and, in obedience,
   you shall find that God is faithful to His Covenant, to His Son and to
   you to whom the promise is made--and you shall be saved! God bless you
   for Christ's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM42.

   Verse 1. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul,
   after You, O God. It is said that when they cannot find water, they
   sometimes let loose a hart, which, flying over the desert sand, by
   instinct seems to scent out the water brook. If he cannot find it,
   however, the stag is subject to a burning thirst. He stands and pants.
   His sides heave while he thirsts. So says David, "As the hart pants (or
   "brays") "after the water brooks."

   2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and
   appear before God?Not God's worship only. Not God's people, but God
   Himself he thirsts for! Oh, for such a thirst! The next best thing to
   having God is to have an insatiable thirst for Him. Do you think a soul
   ever could be cast away that longed for God? Impossible! There is never
   a soul in Hell that had any sincere longings after God. Grace is in
   your heart, dear Hearer. That thirst is Grace if you are longing after
   the living God.

   3. My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say
   unto me, Where is your God? "You are forsaken. God has forgotten you."
   At the very thought of this, he had the salt meat of his tears and
   nothing else, for there is nothing that touches a Christian's heart and
   wounds him to the quick like that. "Where is your God?"

   4. 5. When Iremember these things, Ipour out my soul in me for Ihad
   gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the
   voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day. Why are
   you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted in me? Hope you in
   God: for I shall yet praise Him for the help ofHis countenance. See how
   he clings to God in the dark! When the question cuts through his soul,
   "Where is your God?" he seems to say, "I will none but Him. I will
   follow hard after Him. He is everything to me. I will be sick till He
   heals me. I will be in the dark till He gives me light. I look to none
   but to my God."

   6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember
   You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the HillMizar.
   Or the little hill. I knew You there. There did You meet with me and I
   remember this. And can You have met me in love so often, and will You
   cast me away now? You did there manifest Yourself to me--as You do not
   unto the world, and You are an unchanging lover. Will You not come to
   me again?

   7. Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterspouts. Heaven's
   troubles and earth's trials seem to clasp hands and form a waterspout.
   The deep of Your dark purposes seems to echo to the deep of human
   malice and Satanic wrath. "Deep calls to deep."

   7. All Your waves and Your billows are gone over me. You have
   concentrated an ocean upon my devoted head!

   8. Yet. Oh, what a glorious, "yet," that is! How it swims! Never was
   there a swimming suit like that which is made of hope!

   8. The LORD will command His loving kindness in the daytime, and in the
   night His song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.
   How dear God gets to be to a gracious man in the time of trouble. Just
   now he called God the health of his countenance. Now he calls Him his
   very life. "My prayer unto the God of my life."

   9-11. I will say unto God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why am I
   mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? As with a swordin my
   bones, my enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me, Where
   isyour God? Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you
   disquieted, within me? Hope you in God: for I shall yet praise Him who
   is the health of my countenance, and my God. Or, as the old Psalm puts
   it--

   "Yes, my own God is He."

   A sweet collocation of words, indeed! "Yes, my own God is He." He seems
   to revel in God--to find intense delight in God. God is everything to
   him!

An Unalterable Law

   (No. 3418)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Without shedding of blood there is no remission." Hebrews 9:22.

   EVERYWHERE under the old figurative dispensation, blood was sure to
   greet your eyes. It was the one most prominent thing under the Jewish
   economy--scarcely a ceremony was observed without it. You could not
   enter into any part of the Tabernacle, but you saw traces of the blood-
   sprinkling. Sometimes there were bowls of blood cast at the foot of the
   altar. The place looked so like a shambles, that to visit it must have
   been far from attractive to the natural taste-- and to delight in it, a
   man had need of a spiritual understanding and a lively faith! The
   slaughter of animals was the manner of worship. The effusion of blood
   was the appointed rite and the diffusion of that blood on the floor, on
   the curtains and on the vestments of the priests was the constant
   memorial. When Paul says that almost all things were, under the Law,
   purged with blood, he alludes to a few things that were exempted. Thus
   you will find in several passages the people were exhorted to wash
   their clothes, and certain persons who had been unclean from physical
   causes were bid to wash their clothes with water. Garments worn by men
   were usually cleansed with water. After the defeat of the Midia-nites,
   of which you read in the Book of Numbers, the spoil, which had been
   polluted, had to be purified before it was claimed by the victorious
   Israelites. According to the ordinance of the Law which the Lord
   commanded Moses, some of the goods, such as raiment and articles made
   of skins or goat's hair, were purified with water, while other things
   that were of metal that could abide the fire, were purified by fire.
   Still, the Apostle refers to a literal fact when he says that almost
   all things, garments being the only exception, were purged, under the
   Law of God, with blood. Then he refers to it as a general truth under
   the old legal dispensation, that there was never any pardoning of sin
   except by blood. In one case, only, was there an apparent exception,
   and even that goes to prove the universality of the rule because the
   reason for the exception is so fully given. The trespass-offering,
   referred to as an alternative in Leviticus 5:11, might, in extreme
   cases of excessive poverty, be a bloodless offering. If a man was too
   poor to bring an offering from the flock, he was to bring two
   turtle-doves or young pigeons. But if he was too poor even for that, he
   might offer the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a
   sin-offering, without oil or frankincense, and it was cast upon the
   fire. That is the one solitary exception through all the types. In
   every place, at every time, in every instance where sin had to be
   removed, blood must flow, life must be given! The one exception we have
   noticed gives emphasis to the statute that, "without shedding of blood,
   there is no remission." Under the Gospel there is no exception, not
   such an isolated one as there was under the Law--no, not even for the
   extremely poor! Such we all are spiritually. Since we have not, any of
   us, to bring an offering any more than an offering to bring--but we
   have, all of us, to take the offering which has already been presented
   and to accept the Sacrifice which Christ has, of Himself, made in our
   place--there is now no cause or ground for exemption to any man or
   woman born, nor ever shall there be, either in this world or in that
   which is to come--"Without shedding of blood, there is no remission."
   With great simplicity, then, as it concerns our salvation, may I ask
   the attention of each one here present, to this great matter which
   intimately concerns our everlasting interests? I gather from the text,
   first of all, the encouraging fact that--

   I. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS REMISSION--that is to say, the remission of
   sins. "Without shedding of blood there is no remission." Blood has been
   shed and there is, therefore, hope concerning such a thing. Remission,
   notwithstanding the stern requirements of the Law of God, is not to be
   abandoned in sheer despair. The word, remission, means the putting away
   of debts. Just as sin may be regarded as a debt incurred to God, so
   that debt may be blotted out, cancelled and obliterated. The sinner,
   God's debtor may cease to be in debt by compensation, by full
   acquittance and may be set free by virtue of such remission. Such a
   thing is possible. Glory be to God, the remission of all sin, of which
   it is possible to repent, is possible to be obtained! Whatever the
   transgression of any man may be, pardon is possible to him if
   repentance is possible to him. Unrepented sin is unforgivable sin. If
   he confesses his sin and forsakes it, then shall he find mercy. God has
   so declared it, and He will not be unfaithful to His Word. "But is
   there not," one asks, "a sin which is unto death?" Yes, verily, though
   I know not what it is, nor do we think that any who have enquired into
   the subject have been able to discover what that sin is. This much
   seems clear, that practically the sin is unforgivable because it is
   never repented of. The man who commits it becomes, to all intents and
   purposes, dead in sin in a more deep and lasting sense, even, than the
   human race is as a whole, and he is given up case-hardened--his
   conscience seared, as it were, with a hot iron and, henceforth, he will
   seek no mercy. But all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto men. For lust, for robbery, for adultery--yes, for murder, there
   is forgiveness with God, that He may be feared. He is the Lord God,
   merciful and gracious, passing by transgression, iniquity and sin!

   And this forgiveness which is possible is, according to the Scriptures
   complete. That is to say, when God forgives a man his sin, he does it
   outright. He blots out the debt without any back reckoning. He does not
   put away a part of the man's sin and leave him accountable for the
   rest, but in the moment in which a sin is forgiven, his iniquity is as
   though it had never been committed--he is received in the Father's
   house and embraced with the Father's love as if he had never erred! He
   is made to stand before God as accepted, and in the same condition as
   though he had never transgressed. Blessed be God, Believer, there is no
   sin in God's Book against you! If you have believed, you are
   forgiven--forgiven not partially, but altogether! The handwriting that
   was against you is blotted out, nailed to the Cross of Christ and can
   never be pleaded against you anymore forever! The pardon is complete!

   Moreover, this is a present pardon. It is an imagination of some (very
   derogatory to the Gospel) that you cannot get pardon till you come to
   die and, perhaps, then in some mysterious way, in the last few minutes,
   you may be absolved. But we preach to you in the name of Jesus,
   immediate and present pardon for all transgressions--a pardon given in
   an instant--the moment that a sinner believes in Jesus! Not as though a
   disease were healed gradually and required months and long years of
   progress. True, the corruption of our nature is such a disease and the
   sin that dwells in us must be daily and hourly mortified. But as for
   the guilt of our transgressions before God, and the debt incurred to
   His Justice, the remission thereof is not a thing of progress and
   degree. The pardon of a sinner is granted at once! It will be given to
   any of you tonight who accept it--yes, and given you in such a way that
   you shall never lose it! Once forgiven, you shall be forgiven forever,
   and none of the consequences of sin shall be visited upon you. You
   shall be absolved unreservedly and eternally, so that when the heavens
   are on a blaze, and the Great White Throne is set up, and the last
   great assize is held, you may stand boldly before the Judgment Seat and
   fear no accusation, for the forgiveness which God, Himself, vouchsafes,
   He will never revoke!

   I will add to this one other remark. The man who gets this pardon may
   know he has it Did he merely hope he had it, that hope might often
   struggle with fear. Did he merely trusthe had it, many a qualm might
   startle him. But to know that he has it is a sure ground of peace to
   the heart! Glory be to God, the privileges of the Covenant of Grace are
   not only matters of hope and surmise, but they are matters of faith,
   conviction and assurance! Count it not presumption for a man to believe
   God's Word! God's own Word it is that says, "Whoever believes in Jesus
   Christ is not condemned." If I believe in Jesus Christ, then I am not
   condemned. What right have I to think I am? If God says I am not, it
   would be presumption on my part to think I am condemned! It cannot be
   presumption to take God's Word just as He gives it to me. "Oh," says
   one, "how happy would I be if this might be my case." You have well
   spoken, for blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin
   is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute
   iniquity. "But," says another, "I should hardly think such a great
   thing could be possible to such an one as I am." You reason after the
   manner of the sons of men! Know, then, that as high as the heavens are
   above the earth, so high are God's ways above your ways, and His
   thoughts above your thoughts. It is yours to err--it is God's to
   forgive. You err like a man, but God does not pardon like a man--He
   pardons like a God, so that we burst forth with wonder and sing, "Who
   is a God like unto You, that passes by transgression, iniquity and
   sin?" When you make anything, it is some little work suitable to your
   abilities, but our God made the heavens! When you forgive, it is some
   forgiveness suitable to your nature and circumstances. But when He
   forgives, He displays the riches of His Grace on a grander scale than
   your finite mind can comprehend! Ten thousand sins of blackest dye,
   sins of a hellish hue, He does in a moment put away, for He delights in
   mercy! And judgment is His strange work. "As I live, says the Lord, I
   have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, but had rather that he
   turn unto

   Me and live." This is a joyful note with which my text furnishes me!
   There is no remission except with blood--but there is remission, for
   the blood has been shed!

   Coming more closely to the text, we have now to insist on its great
   lesson, that--

   II. THOUGH THERE IS PARDON OF SIN, IT IS NEVER WITHOUT BLOOD. That is a
   sweeping sentence, for there are some in this world that are trusting
   for the pardon of sin to their repentance. It, beyond question, is your
   duty to repent of your sin. If you have disobeyed God, you should be
   sorry for it. To cease from sin is but the duty of the creature, else
   sin is not the violation of God's holy Law. But be it known unto you
   that all the repentance in the world cannot blot out the smallest sin!
   If you had only one sinful thought cross your mind and you should
   grieve over that all the days of your life, yet the stain of that sin
   could not be removed even by the anguish it cost you! Where repentance
   is the work of the Spirit of God, it is a very precious gift and is
   sign of Grace--but there is no atoning power in repentance! In a sea
   full of penitential tears, there is not the power or the virtue to wash
   out one spot of this hideous uncleanness. Without the blood-shedding,
   there is no remission! But others suppose that, at any rate, active
   reformation growing out of repentance may achieve the task. What if
   drunkenness is given up and temperance becomes the rule? What if
   licentiousness is abandoned and chastity adorns the character? What if
   dishonest dealing is relinquished and integrity is scrupulously
   maintained in every action? I say, 'tis well! I would to God such
   reformations took place everywhere--yet for all that, debts already
   incurred are not paid by our not getting into further debt--and past
   delinquencies are not condoned by future good behavior. So sin is not
   remitted by reformation! Though you should suddenly become immaculate
   as angels (not that such a thing is possible to you, for the Ethiopian
   cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his spots), your reformations
   could make no atonement to God for the sins that are past in the days
   that you have transgressed against Him. "What, then," says the man,
   "shall I do?" There are those who think that now their prayers and
   their humbling of soul may, perhaps, effect something for them. Your
   prayers, if they are sincere, I would not quit, rather do I hope they
   may be such prayers as betoken spiritual life. But oh, dear Hearer,
   there is no efficacy in prayer to blot out sin! I will put it strongly.
   All the prayers of all the saints on earth and if the saints in Heaven
   could all join--all their prayers could not blot out through their own
   natural efficacy the sin of a single evil word! No, there is no
   deterrent power in prayer. God has never set it to be a cleanser. It
   has its uses, and its valuable uses. It is one of the privileges of the
   man who prays, that he prays acceptably, but prayer, itself, can never
   blot out a sin without the blood! "Without the shedding of blood there
   is no remission," pray as you may!

   There are persons who have thought that self-denial and mortifications
   of an extraordinary kind might rid them of their guilt. We do not often
   come across such people in our circle, yet there are those who, in
   order to purge themselves of sin, flagellate their bodies, observe
   protracted fasts, wear sackcloth and hair shirts next to their
   skin--and even some have gone so far as to imagine that to refrain from
   bathing and to allow their body to be filthy, was the readiest mode of
   purifying their soul! A strange infatuation, certainly! Yet today, in
   India, you shall find the fakir passing his body through marvelous
   sufferings and distortions in the hope of getting rid of sin! To what
   purpose is it all? I think I hear the Lord say, "What is this to Me
   that you did bow your head like a bulrush, and wrapped yourself in
   sackcloth, and ate ashes with your bread, and mingled wormwood with
   your drink? You have broken My Law--these things cannot repair it! You
   have done injury to My honor by your sin, but where is the
   righteousness that reflects honor upon My name?" The old cry in the
   olden days was, "How shall we come before God?" and they said, "Shall
   we give our first-born for our transgression, the fruit of our body for
   the sin of our soul?" Alas, it was all in vain! Here stands the
   sentence. Here forever must it stand--"Without shedding of blood there
   is no remission." It is the life God demands as the penalty due for
   sin, and nothing but the life indicated in the blood-shedding will ever
   satisfy Him!

   Observe again how this sweeping text puts away all confidence in
   ceremony, even the ceremonies of God's own ordinance. There are some
   who suppose that sin can be washed away in Baptism. Ah, futile fancy!
   The expression where it is once used in Scripture implies nothing of
   the kind--it has no such meaning as some attach to it, for that very
   Apostle, of whom it was said gloried that he had not baptized many
   persons lest they should suppose there was some efficacy in his
   administration of the rite. Baptism is an admirable ordinance in which
   the Believer holds fellowship with Christ in His death. It is a
   symbol--it is nothing more! Tens of thousands and millions have been
   baptized and have died in their sins. Or what profit is there in the
   unbloody sacrifice of the "Mass," as Antichrist puts it? Do any say it
   is "an unbloody sacrifice," yet at the same time offer it for a
   propitiation for sin? We fling this text in their faces--"Without
   shedding of blood there is no remission." Do they reply that the blood
   is there in the body of Christ? We answer that even were it so, that
   would not meet the case for it is without the shedding of
   blood--without the blood-shedding, the blood as distinct from the
   flesh--without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin!

   And here I must pass on to make a distinction that will go still
   deeper. Jesus Christ, Himself, cannot save us apart from His blood. It
   is a supposition which only folly has ever made but we must refute even
   the hypothesis of folly when it affirms that the example of Christ can
   put away human sin, that the Holy life of Jesus Christ has put the race
   on such a good footing with God that He can now forgive its faults and
   its transgression. Not so! Not the holiness of Jesus! Not the life of
   Jesus! Not the death of Jesus, but the BLOOD of Jesus only, for,
   "Without shedding of blood there is no remission."

   And I have met with some who think so much of the Second Coming of
   Christ, that they seem to have fixed their entire faith upon Christ in
   His Glory. I believe this to be the fault of Irvingism--that it holds
   too much before the sinner's eyes Christ on the Throne, whereas, though
   Christ on the Throne is ever the loved and adorable, yet we must see
   Christ upon the Cross, or we can never be saved! Your faith must not be
   placed merely in Christ Glorified, but in Christ Crucified. "God forbid
   that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." "We
   preach Christ Crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the
   Greeks foolishness." I remember one person who was united with this
   Church (the dear Sister may be present now), that had been for some
   years a professor, and had never enjoyed peace with God, nor produced
   any of the fruits of the Spirit. She said, "I have been in a church
   where I was taught to rest upon Christ Glorified and I did so fix my
   confidence, such as it was, upon Him, that I neither had a sense of
   sin, nor a sense of pardon from Christ Crucified! I did not know and
   until I had seen Him as shedding His blood and making a Propitiation, I
   never entered into rest." Yes, we will say it again, for the text is
   vitally important--"Without the shedding of blood, there is no
   remission," not even with Christ Himself! It is the Sacrifice that He
   has offered for us that is the means of putting away our sin--this, and
   nothing else! Let us pass on a little further with the same Truth of
   God--

   III. THE REMISSION OF SIN IS TO BE FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS.

   There is remission to be had through Jesus Christ, whose blood was
   shed. The hymn we sang at the commencement of the service gave you the
   marrow of the Doctrine. We owe to God a debt of punishment for sin. Was
   that debt due or not? If the Law was right, the penalty ought to be
   exacted. If the penalty was too severe and the Law inaccurate, then God
   made a mistake. But it is blasphemy to suppose that! The Law of God,
   then, being a righteous Law, and the penalty just, shall God do an
   unjust thing? It will be an unjust thing for Him not to carry out the
   penalty! Would you have Him to be unjust? He had declared that the soul
   that sinned should die--would you have God to be a liar? Shall He eat
   His words to save His creatures? "Let God be true, and every man a
   liar." The Law's sentence must be carried out! It was inevitable that
   if God maintained the prerogative of His holiness, He must punish the
   sins that men have committed. How, then, could He save us? Behold the
   plan! His dear Son, the Lord of Glory, takes upon Himself human nature,
   comes into the place of as many as the Father gave Him, stands in their
   standing and when the sentence of justice has been proclaimed and the
   sword of vengeance has leaped out of its scabbard, behold the glorious
   Substitute bares His arm and He says, "Strike, O, sword, but strike Me
   and let My people go!" Into the very soul of Jesus the sword of the Law
   pierced and His blood was shed, the blood not of One who was only Man,
   but of One who, by His being an eternal Spirit, was able to offer up
   Himself without spot unto God in a way which gave Infinite Efficacy to
   His sufferings. He, through the eternal Spirit, we are told, offered
   Himself without spot to God. Being in His own Nature infinitely beyond
   the nature of man, comprehending all the natures of man, as it were,
   within Himself by reason of the majesty of His Person, He was able to
   offer an Atonement to God of infinite, boundless, inconceivable
   sufficiency!

   What our Lord suffered, none of us can tell. I am sure of this--I would
   not disparage or underestimate His physical sufferings--the tortures He
   endured in His body--but I am equally sure that we can, none of us,
   exaggerate or overvalue the sufferings of such a soul as His! They are
   beyond all conception! So pure and so perfect, so exquisitely
   sensitive, and so immaculately holy was He, that to be numbered with
   transgressors, to be smitten by His Father, to die (shall I say it?)
   the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers, was the very
   essence of bitterness, the consummation of anguish! "Yet it pleased the
   Father to bruise Him. He has put Him to grief." His sorrows in
   themselves were what the Greek liturgy well calls them--"unknown
   sufferings, great griefs." Hence, too, their efficacy is boundless,
   without limit. Now, therefore, God is able to forgive sin. He has
   punished the sin on Christ--it becomes justice, as well as mercy, that
   God should blot out those debts which have been paid. It were unjust--I
   speak with reverence, but yet with holy boldness--it were unjust on the
   part of the Infinite Majesty, to lay to my charge a single sin which
   was laid to the charge ofmy Substitute. If my Surety took my sin, He
   released me, and I am clear! Who shall resuscitate judgment against me
   when I have been condemned in the Person of my Savior? Who shall commit
   me to the flames of Hell, when Christ, my Substitute, has suffered the
   tantamount of Hell for me? Who shall lay anything to my charge when
   Christ has had all my crimes laid to His charge, answered for them,
   expiated them and received the token of quittance from them, in that He
   was raised from the dead that He might openly vindicate that
   justification in which, by Grace I am called and privileged to share?
   This is all very simple, it lies in a nutshell, but do we all receive
   it--have we all accepted it? Oh, my dear Hearers, the text is full of
   warning to some of you! You may have an amiable disposition, an
   excellent character, a serious turn of mind, but you quibble at
   accepting Christ! You stumble at this stumbling stone! You split on
   this rock. How can I meet your hapless case? I shall not reason with
   you. I refuse to enter into any argument. I ask you one question. Do
   you believe this Bible to be Inspired of God? Look, then, at that
   passage--"Without the shedding of blood there is no remission." What
   say you? Is it not plain, absolute, conclusive? Allow me to draw the
   inference. If you have not an interest in the blood-shedding, which I
   have briefly endeavored to describe, is there any remission for you?
   Can there be? Your own sins are on your head! Of your hand shall they
   be demanded at the coming of the great Judge. You may labor, you may
   toil, you may be sincere in your convictions and quiet in your
   conscience, or you may be tossed about with your scruples, but as the
   Lord lives, there is no pardon for you except through this shedding of
   blood! Do you reject it? On your own head will lie the peril! God has
   spoken. It cannot be said that your ruin is designed by Him when your
   own remedy is revealed by Him!

   He bids you take the way which He appoints, but if you reject it, you
   must die! Your death is suicide, be it deliberate, accidental, or
   through error of judgment. Your blood is on your own head. You are
   warned!

   On the other hand, what a far-reaching consolation the text gives us!
   "Without shedding of blood there is no remission," but where there is
   the blood-shedding, there is remission! If you have come to Christ, you
   are saved. If you can say from your very heart--

   "My faith does lay her hand, On that dear head of Yours, When like a
   penitent I stand, And here confess my sin."

   Then your sin is gone! Where is that young man? Where is that young
   woman? Where are those anxious hearts that have been saying, "We would
   be pardoned now"? Oh, look, look, look, look to the Crucified Savior
   and you are pardoned! You may go your way, inasmuch as you have
   accepted God's Atonement. Daughter, be of good cheer, your sins, which
   are many, are forgiven you! Son, rejoice, for your transgressions are
   blotted out!

   My last word shall be this. You that are teachers of others and trying
   to do good, cleave fast to this Doctrine. Let this be the front, the
   center, the pith and the marrow of all you have to testify. I often
   preach it, but there is never a Sabbath in which I go to my bed with
   such inward contentment as when I have preached the Substitutionary
   Sacrifice of Christ. Then I feel, "If sinners are lost, I have none of
   their blood upon me." This is the soul-saving Doctrine--grip it and you
   shall have laid hold of eternal life! Reject it and you reject it to
   your confusion! Oh, keep to this! Martin Luther used to say that every
   sermon ought to have the Doctrine of Justification by Faith in it.
   True, but let it also have the Doctrine of Atonement in it. He says he
   could not get the Doctrine of Justification by Faith into the
   Wurtembergers' heads and he felt half-inclined to take the book into
   the pulpit and fling it at their heads in order to get it in! I am
   afraid he would not have succeeded if he had. But oh, how would I try
   to hammer again, and again, and again upon this one nail--"The blood is
   the life thereof." "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."

   Christ giving up His life in pouring out His blood--it is thisthat
   gives pardon and peace to every one of you, if you will but look to
   Him--pardon now, complete pardon, pardon forever! Look away from all
   other confidences and rely upon the sufferings and the death of the
   Incarnate God who has gone into the Heaven, and who lives today to
   plead before His Father's Throne, the merit of the blood which, on
   Calvary, He poured forth for sinners! As I shall meet you all in that
   great day, when the Crucified One shall come as the King and Lord of
   all, which day is hastening near--as I shall meet you then, I pray you
   bear me witness that I have strived to tell you in all simplicity what
   is the way of salvation! And if you reject it, do me this favor, to say
   that at least I have proffered to you in Jehovah's name this, His
   Gospel, and have earnestly urged you to accept it, that you may be
   saved! But, by God's Grace , I would rather meet you there, all covered
   in the one Atonement, clothed in the one righteousness, and accepted in
   the one Savior! And then together will we sing,

   "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God by His
   blood to receive honor, and power, and dominion forever and ever."
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH57.

   A lament for the death of the righteous--many of them put to death by
   persecution.

   Verses 1, 2. The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and
   merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous are
   taken away from the evil to come. They shall enter into peace: they
   shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness. When
   there is a storm coming on, you may see the shepherds among the hills
   gathering their sheep and taking them home. And when good men die in
   large numbers and the Church's ranks are thinned, it is sometimes a
   token that bad times are coming on--and so God takes away the righteous
   from the evil to come. Oh, did men know what the world loses when a
   good man dies, they would regret it far more than the death of emperors
   and kings who fear not God! But as for those who are made righteous by
   the Grace of God, they need not fear to die. To them it will be a
   rest--a sleep with Jesus--till the trumpet of the Resurrection--and all
   the evil that will come upon the world will not touch them. They shall
   rest till the Master comes! Now, the rest of the Chapter is a very
   terrible description of the sin of the people of Isaiah's day. And at
   last it contains a very brilliant display of the Grace of God.

   3, 4. But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
   adulterer and the harlot Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against
   whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? Are you not
   children of transgression, a seed of falsehood?Because this people so
   exalted against God and His Gospel, God would not allow that they were
   the true seed of Israel at all. He makes them out to be a false,
   degenerate breed--and He asks them how they dare to sport against His
   Prophets and draw out the tongue, and make a wide mouth against those
   who spoke for the God of Israel.

   5. Enfaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the
   children in the valley under the cliffs of the rocks?The Lord had said
   that they should offer sacrifices only on one altar at Jerusalem--and
   to Him alone--but they had set up altars under all the ancient oaks to
   worship all sorts of gods. In addition to this, they had gone so far
   after the cruel way of the Pagans that they offered their own children
   in sacrifice in the valleys, under the cliffs and the rocks.

   6. Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion: they, they
   are your lot; even to them have youpoured a drink offering, you have
   offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?They had set
   up the smooth stones which they had found in the brook, and made them
   into altars--no, made gods of them--for when man wants to make a god,
   anything will do, whether it is the fetish of the cannibal, or the
   round robin of the ritualist. It little matters which. A piece of bread
   will do, for a god, as well as a piece of stone. Anything will man
   worship, sooner than worship the great, invisible, eternal God!

   7, 8. Upon a lofty and high mountain have you set your bed: even there
   you went up to offer sacrifice. Behind the doors, also, and the posts
   have you set up your remembrance. Where they ought to have put up texts
   of Scripture and the remembrance of God's Law, they had set up
   memorials of their false gods everywhere, for when men become
   superstitious and worship falsely, they seem to be far more eager about
   it than those who worship the true God. They go on all fours at it, and
   give themselves wholly up to their superstitions.

   8, 9. For you have uncovered yourself to another than Me, and are gone
   up. You have enlarged your bed and made you a covenant with them. You
   loved their bed where you saw it. And you went to the king with
   ointment, and did increase your perfumes and did send your messengers
   far off and did debase yourself even unto Hell When they were in
   trouble, instead of going to God, they went to the king of Egypt, that
   he might come and help them against the king of Assyria--but they would
   never turn to God! They loved idols and so they trusted in an arm of
   flesh. They forgot the invincible arm which had overthrown Pharaoh at
   the Red Sea and worked such wondrous miracles for the deliverance of
   His people. And they made gods of the kings of the earth and trusted in
   them, "and did debase yourself even unto Hell."

   10. You are wearied in the greatness of your way. They did so much and
   they were so superstitious, that they even wearied themselves with it.

   10. Yet said you not, There is no hope: you have found the life of your
   hand; therefore you were not grieved. So long as they did but live,
   they did not think that there was any hope of anything better--and so
   they were not grieved for all their sin and all their trouble.

   11. And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and
   have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have not I held My
   peace even of old, and you fear Me not?This is the old trouble--that
   because God does not smite down sinners, then and there, they take
   liberties with Him. They do not know that His patience--His slackness,
   as they call it--is long-suffering because He is not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance. And so He puts
   up His sword. Yet He says, "Have not I held My peace, even of old, and
   you fear Me not?"

   12. I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall
   not profit you. They said, "Why, we are very righteous. Have not we got
   a god in every corner? As for our works, we have plenty of them. Have
   not we temples built everywhere, and altars set up on every hill and in
   every valley?" "Yes," says God, "such is your righteousness. They shall
   not profit you."

   13. When you cry, letyour collection ofidols deliver you: but the
   windshall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts
   his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy
   mountain--Oh, what a sarcasm! But how just. You that love not God, when
   you are in trouble, let your sins deliver you if they can! Let your
   pleasures comfort you!

   14. 15. And one shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way,
   take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people. For thus says
   the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I
   dwell in the high and holy place with him, also, who is of a contrite
   and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive
   the heart of the contrite ones. We dwell in time and, by-and-by, we are
   hurried into eternity--but God always dwells in eternity! It is a very
   beautiful thought that He should have two dwelling places. A blasphemer
   once met a humble Christian and he said, "Pray, is yours a great God or
   a little God?" "Well," said he, "He is so great a God that the Heaven
   of heavens cannot contain Him, but He condescends to make Himself so
   little that He can dwell in my poor humble heart." God has two temples.
   The one is the high and holy place--the other is the lowly and the
   humble place. May we have Him in our hearts--and then shall we be in
   His Heaven before long.

   16. For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry. God
   does not like being angry, and though sin provokes Him, yet He feels
   not at ease when He is wrathful.

   16. For the spirit would fail before Me, and the souls which Ihave mad.
   It would destroy them. Man could not bear God's anger forever.

   17-19. For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry and smote him:
   I hid and was angry, and he went on in the way of his heart. Ihave seen
   his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him, also, and restore
   comforts unto him and to his mourners. I create the fruit of the lips.
   God teaches men how to speak words of penitence, and faith, and prayer
   and praise.

   19. Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, says
   the LORD; andI willhealhim. He puts it twice over, because it is such a
   prodigy of Grace that God should heal sinners that are so polluted with
   sin! He puts it over again. "I will heal him."

   20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
   whose waters cast up mire and dirt. " Work up" such is the word--"whose
   waters work up mire and dirt" continually, as it were, in a work, and
   bringing up its filthi-ness from the bottom--bringing it to the
   shore--taking away the brightness from every wave and the crystal blue
   from every drop. Its waters cast up mire and dirt.

   21. There is no peace, says my God, to the wicket.

God, the Husband of His People

   (No. 3419)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 13, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 30, 1869.

   "Although I was a Husband unto them, says the Lord." Jeremiah 31:32.

   SIN is greatly aggravated by the mercy of God, of which the sinner has
   been a partaker. Sin in a child of God is peculiarly sinful. Instead of
   its being a trifle, as some men seem to think, it is a very solemn
   matter, indeed. To have had deep draughts of Divine Love and then to
   deeply offend against that love is no light thing. This seems to have
   been the crying part of Israel's sin. "Although I was a Husband unto
   them."

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, God's ancient people, Israel, seem to
   have lived and passed across the page of history on purpose that they
   might remain forever the picture of ourselves. Whenever you read of
   their backsliding, of their idolatries, of their provoking of God's
   Spirit, you may shut the book and say, "Within my heart there is all
   this and my life is as like to this as in a glass, face answers to
   face." We must not be slow to condemn their sin, but we must always
   remember that there are two culprits at the bar--and that when we
   condemn them we also condemn ourselves!

   Now, at this time, we shall first of all, spend a few minutes in
   considering the indictment which God brought against His people
   Israel--they had sinned--"although," He said, "I was a Husband unto
   them." Secondly, we shall have to plead guilty to the indictment for
   ourselves. And then, thirdly, we shall offer some suggestions of
   amendment that should arise out of the painful and penitent reflections
   of this evening. First, then, let us consider very earnestly and
   humbly--

   I. THE INDICTMENT WHICH GOD BROUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL.

   Their sin was aggravated because God was a Husband unto them. How was
   this? He was a Husband to them in that He set His special love upon
   them as a husband does upon his bride. He found them, as He says, in a
   desert land, in a howling wilderness. He found them, as we know,
   literally, in the land of Egypt, in the house of bondage where their
   lives were made bitter in the cruel slavery of making bricks for their
   tyrant masters. But He so loved them that with a high hand and an
   outstretched arm, He redeemed them. All His plagues He brought on
   Pharaoh and upon the fields of Zoan. He magnified His power, even on
   the tribes of Pharaoh, and at the Red Sea He glorified Himself by the
   destruction of all the hosts of Egypt. But as for His people, He led
   them forth like sheep, by the hands of Moses and Aaron. A husband,
   having loved his bride, and finding her in slavery, would never cease
   until the utmost that could be done had been done for her liberty and
   happiness! And God was thus a Husband unto His people. He says, "I gave
   Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you."

   He was a Husband unto them, further, in that He made them and them,
   only, to be His special people. As the husband turns not his eyes to
   others, but sets his heart upon the one peculiar one, so did the Lord
   towards His people, Israel. And what people were like unto them--what
   people to whom God manifested Himself so clearly? There were other
   nations greater than they, but God did not send His Truth unto them,
   but they lived and perished in darkness. But God, in His Sovereign
   Grace, set His heart on Israel--Israel He loved--and Israel, alone!

   He was a Husband unto them, in the next place, in that He remained
   faithful to them. He had taken them, as it were, for better or for
   worse--and worse, it was, with terrible preponderance! They grieved His
   Spirit and provoked Him to anger, yet He cast not away His people. Even
   to this day He is still a Husband unto Israel, and the day shall come
   when the scattered and the dispersed of Judah shall be gathered with
   all their brethren into their own land. And where they sat down and
   wept, and mourned over the desolation of their cities, they shall once
   again wake the harp with joy and gladness! God has been a Husband to
   that people in the faithfulness which He exhibited towards them.

   He was their Husband, too, in this sense, that He communed with them
   most lovingly. There were divers appearances which the Lord made to His
   people by His Prophets and He did great wonders and worked many signs
   and miracles. Besides that, He revealed Himself in the Tabernacle and
   in the Temple--in the sacrifice and in the offerings. True, in not so
   clear a light as He has revealed Himself to us, but still, with
   marvelous brightness as compared with the darkness in which the whole
   world was lying. As a husband reveals himself in love with his spouse,
   so did the Lord as a Husband unto His ancient Church.

   In addition to this, He took care to provide for His people, Israel, as
   a husband does, when with all his worldly goods he does endow her whom
   he has chosen. What people were like they--who ate angels' food? Yes,
   they ate manna to the fullest. If they needed water, the Rock furnished
   it to them! He brought oil out of the flinty rock when they needed it.
   All that they needed in the wilderness was supplied bounteously to
   them. Their garments grew not old, neither were their feet sore by the
   space of 40 years, though they passed through that howling wilderness
   where no supplies could be drawn! No people were ever better provided
   for than they, for even their luxury was sometimes at least
   gratified--when they asked for flesh, the quails descended and they
   were fattened thereon.

   In addition to that, the God who had become their Husband protected
   them as the husband does his wife. He chased the Amalekites before
   them! He allowed no people to withstand them when they went forth to
   battle--and the Lord led the van. Though He chastened them before their
   enemies for their sins, yet when they returned, He made one of them to
   smite a thousand and to put ten thousand to flight. Marvelous were the
   deliverances which the Lord worked for His people. Time would fail us
   to tell of Gideon and of Barak, of Sampson and of Jephtha and of all
   that the Lord, the Husband of Israel, did in the deliverance of His
   spouse!

   Nor did He rest until He had brought His people, Israel, into that
   quiet and settled state which is the expectation of those who enter
   into the marriage relationship. Under their own vines and their own fig
   trees He made them to sit down and rest. He brought them to land that
   flowed with milk and honey, out of whose hills they could dig brass. He
   drove out the heathen before them, and gave them their land for an
   heritage, even an heritage forever for His people, Israel, and there
   the spouse of God might long have enjoyed her rest and her peace, had
   it not been that she broke her Covenant although He had been a Husband
   unto her.

   Now, Beloved, just think, before we turn away from this, what a
   wonderful picture this is of how the Lord has dealt with such of us as
   are His believing people. Think of His love to us when He brought us
   out of Egypt. We remember well, some of us, the days of our bondage,
   for the iron entered into our soul. We can never forget those deep
   convictions, those terrible lashes of the Law and our own endeavors to
   make bricks without straw, that we might save ourselves by our works.
   How gloriously He brought us forth! How He made us to eat of the
   paschal lamb, and how the blood-mark was put upon the lintel and the
   two side posts! And we learned what it was for God to look upon the
   blood and to pass over us. And what a triumphant day that was when all
   our sins were drowned in the shoreless flood of the Savior's Atonement!
   What a shout went up from our hearts that day--louder and sweeter than
   even that of the daughters of Israel when they followed Miriam with
   their tabrets and timbrels to the dance! We did say then and in
   recollection of it, we will say it again, "Sing unto the Lord, for He
   has triumphed gloriously!" As for our sins, the depths have covered
   them, there is not one of them left! Those Egyptians, whom we saw
   through our tears, we shall see no more forever!

   From that day, how God has been pleased to prove that He is a Husband
   to us, by His special love to us! We never can doubt that Doctrine of
   His special love. I hate to see a contracted mind that will not
   tolerate the thought that God has a benevolence towards allHis
   creatures. His tender mercies are over all His works, but do let us
   never in the thought of that forget that there is also a peculiar and
   special affection which He has towards His own chosen whom He brings to
   Christ! He loves not the world as He loves His spouse! God has no
   affection towards the ungodly such as He has towards those whom He has
   united unto Himself and made to be His, as the spouse is to her
   husband, in a vital, affectionate, intense, eternal union!

   God has been a Husband to us certainly in that not only has He chosen
   us specially in His love, but also in that He has been marvelously
   faithful in that love. I can scarcely speak to you without feeling the
   tears well up in my eyes when I think of my own unfaithfulness to Him
   who loved me before the earth was. Oh, which is the stranger of the
   two--that He should love us or that we should treat Him so
   unfaithfully?--

   "Yet, though I have Him oft forgot,

   His loving kindness changes not."

   Precious Truth of God! He has been a Husband unto us. He has never
   thought of divorce. Is it not written that "He hates putting away"? And
   so He does and He has not put us away, but we are as dear to Him, now,
   as we were of old, and as we shall be when we stand before His face
   without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing!

   Remember, my Brothers and Sisters, also, in thinking over how God has
   been a Husband to us, as He was to Israel, that He has been pleased to
   provide for us as He did for Israel. Providentially, in temporal
   matters, we have been provided for. Perhaps some of you could not tell
   how you have been led in a very intricate pathway. There have been
   times when you have been on the verge of need, and periods, certainly,
   when you had nothing to spare. And yet, up to this moment, He that
   feeds the sparrows and clothes the lilies has not let you starve, and
   you can sing to the praise of His faithfulness that bread has been
   given you and your waters have been sure. But it has been specially so
   in spiritual things. Do you ever know what it is to be drained right
   out in spirituals--to come right to the very bottom--lower than the
   poor widow when she had but a handful of meal to make one cake and then
   die? Alas, some of us know what it is to be brought to extreme
   spiritual poverty and a sense of nothingness in ourselves that
   well-nigh breaks us to pieces and lowers us into the abyss of despair!
   But though the tide has ebbed out fearfully, there has always been
   enough water for every galley of Grace to float--and though the night
   has been very dark, there has always been light enough for the soul to
   find its way somehow! And though at times the tempest has howled
   terribly through the gloom, yet there has always been a harbor, so that
   we have been enabled to outride the hurricane--and so we shall yet
   outride all the storms we encounter until we reach the port of bliss!
   He has well provided for us and, therein, has He been a Husband unto
   us.

   And equally well has He protected us. We little know how much we owe to
   the protection of Providence. We sometimes forget our dangers. I was
   amused to hear of a sailor when he was out in the Channel. You would
   think he was in great danger, saying, "What a dreadful thing it must
   be, to be on land in such an hour, with chimney-pots flying about and
   tiles falling off the houses. Who knows who may be killed if they are
   not safe at sea in such a storm!" We do not always reckon upon these
   immunities from danger which God gives us, or know how much they cost.
   Indeed, if Providence goes very smoothly with us, we do not seem to
   notice it at all! A father and a son, living at some distance from each
   other, agreed to meet half-way on a certain day. The son, after he had
   saluted his father, said, "I have met with a most remarkable Providence
   on the road! My horse fell three times, and yet I was not at all hurt."
   "Ah," said the father, "I have had an equally remarkable Providence! I
   rode my horse all the way and he did not even stumble." We do not often
   notice the hand of Providence in that kind of thing as we ought to do.
   The preservations of our life--oh we do not know how many there are!
   Now and then we have a surprising one which we can observe--and we jot
   that down in our diary--but we have many more which are not noticed by
   us. And as for spiritual preservations, my Brothers and Sisters,
   incessantly in danger as we are from temptations from within and
   corruptions from within, from our circumstances, from the world, from
   the flesh, from the devil--God has, indeed, been a Husband to us and a
   wall of fire round about us, protecting us, else we had not been here
   among His people tonight--but we would have been numbered among the
   castaways who have gone back into perdition!

   So I might continue, for I think we may add that last point. God has
   given to many of us just that settled rest which He gave to His people
   Israel when they came to Canaan. He has been a Husband to us and as
   Naomi said to Ruth, "My daughter, you shall find rest in the house of
   your husband," so have we found rest in Jesus Christ--a peace of God
   which passes all understanding! And we have come to a land that flows
   with milk and honey. We have crossed the Jordan of doubts and fears,
   and though we have not driven out the Canaanites of daily temptation,
   yet we still possess the land, for we that have believed do enter into
   rest.

   This, then is the indictment against us, that although He has been a
   Husband unto us, we have not acted towards Him as such a Husband's love
   deserves. So we turn now to the next great thought, which is this--

   II. WE HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THE INDICTMENT AGAINST OURSELVES.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, I desire not to speak so much to you as to
   myself. And I pray of you that my voice may be accepted as your own
   voice to yourselves and if anything comes home to the conscience, open
   the door to it--let it wound you and let it grieve you--and let it
   awaken you to something nobler. God grant that it may.

   What have been the peculiar sins that we, as Christian people, have
   committed against the love of God who has been as a Husband to us?
   Well, first, it is a very grievous offense against the marriage state
   when the heart of the bride wanders--when she is not sure, after all,
   that her husband is the man of her choice, and the man whom, above all
   others, she esteems. Now-- I am afraid we have commonly committed such
   an offense against our union with God. Our thoughts have often
   wandered--wandered from our God. Our dearest earthly friends have
   sometimes tempted our hearts away. Verily I perceive that we often
   idolize children--but even worse--for in a certain sense it is worse
   that more sordid idolatry, the love of gold, the desire to be rich, has
   led many a soul astray from its chaste, simple, ardent affection to the
   God of Love. Our very books and our studies may decoy us from our God.
   Yes, our own ministers, whom we love, and even what we hear from them,
   may stand between us and God! The man that will be an idolater will
   make a god of anything, as the poor Hottentots do with a bit of rag
   which they will call a god, and worship it! We may make a god of
   anything, and how quick we are to do it! Oh, our God, our God, our God!
   Do You condescend to make Yourself a Husband to us? Oh, can there be
   anything compared to You? What shall we even think of as second to You?
   You are fullness of joy! You are infinity of good! What fools, what
   madmen, what sinners of a scarlet dye are we when we let our heart even
   wink its eye, as it were, to anything else, much less go astray and
   miss the love which we ought to give to God alone! That is the first
   sin of which we may stand convicted--wandering in heart from God,
   although He has been a Husband unto us.

   Our second sin, probably, is that we have been negligent in His
   service. It is the wife's joy to please her husband and unkindness or
   negligence from her becomes a grievous mischief in the household
   circle. Now, if God becomes a Husband unto us, what ought we to do for
   Him? I think He might come tonight and say, "I have something against
   you," and He might look us in the face and say, "I have not wearied you
   with sacrifice, but you have wearied Me with your sins. You have
   brought Me no sweet canes, neither have you filled Me with the fat of
   your sacrifices." Much that we might have done for our Lord's Glory we
   have negligently left undone. Many and many a fair opportunity of
   speaking well of His great name has slipped by, unused. Brothers and
   Sisters, is it not so? I read once in a letter from a Brother that he
   had attained unto perfect sanctification for 20 years! Oh, if it were
   true, what would I give if I could say the same! I do not believe it,
   or that any one of us has for 20 minutes done all that he could for his
   Master, much less for 20 years! There must have been sins of omission,
   at least! I dare not look back upon a single sermon without feeling
   that I ought to have preached it better, nor ever rise from my knees in
   prayer without feeling that I ought to have prayed more earnestly and
   to have come nearer to God. Everything seems marred and spoiled. We
   will strive after perfection, but who among us has attained it? Have we
   not been negligent in the loving kindness which we ought to have
   manifested toward Him who has been a Husband to us?

   Further than that, Brothers and Sisters, have we not been very much to
   blame in the slackness of our communion? The wife desires to see her
   husband. She says--

   "There is nae luck about the house, When the gude man's awe!"

   She cannot be satisfied without his presence! She says there is music
   in the sound of his footstep when she hears it on the stairs. She loves
   to meet him when he comes home from his daily labor. It is her joy to
   be in his company. Has it been so with us? Oh, Brothers and Sisters,
   you have come up, sometimes, to this Tabernacle and you have listened
   to me, but you have not had any desire to get near to God, or if you
   have, it has been a very faint desire--and you have gone away without
   seeing Him! And day after day will pass with some professors without a
   word with the Master--without a single glimpse of the Savior! They seem
   to be content when the great good Lord, who is a Husband to them is far
   away. It must not be so anymore! Let us confess the sin. I fear it is
   so with most of us.

   A further sin against God, our Husband, is this, that I fear we have
   often been loose in our trust in Him. It would be a sad thing if the
   wife did not believe her husband's word and if she could not trust her
   husband's heart. Now, it has been so between us and God sometimes. He
   cannot lie! Moreover, He has given us two immutable things wherein it
   is impossible for Him to lie, that we might have strong consolation who
   have fled for refuge to the hope that is set before us in the Gospel.
   He has never broken a promise yet--if we never doubted God till God
   gave us cause to doubt Him--doubting would be unknown! And yet have we
   not been base enough, when some new trial has come, to sit down and
   say, "Shall I get through this? Will the promise be fulfilled now? Will
   not the Lord, after all, leave His servant to perish?" Shame on us!
   Shame on us! Shame on us! The Lord forgive us our unbelief, and
   strengthen our faith!

   Once more, is there not this sin very common among professors--that
   even the idea of this relationship of God has not crossed some
   professors' minds? This is a sweeping charge to bring, but the Doctrine
   of the Union of the Believerwith Christ, and of the marriage of the
   Believer to Christ, is not even thought of by many professing
   Christians. They are Believers in Christ and they look to the precious
   blood, but they have not entered into that which is within the veil.
   They have not sought to know those choicer and deeper things. Well, but
   is this right, that God should be a Husband unto us, and yet that we
   should not recognize the relation? Married, and not know it? God, your
   Husband, and you never think of Him? Does this blessed fact never tone
   your life, nor give a color to your actions, never check your hand, nor
   nerve it for a holy deed? Is this all put away, as if there were
   nothing in it, but perhaps a pretty fancy, or a word or two that might
   be listened to, but might as well be forgotten? Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, this is sin, indeed, and I am sure that there are few of us
   that are not guilty, probably none of us, for oftentimes we have
   forgotten this union, though we have known and understood it! We have
   walked towards God as if we were strangers to Him and there were no
   relationship by blood between us and our God through Jesus Christ!

   Thus have I read the indictment, and thus would I plead guilty. Thus
   would I weigh, and thus would I ask each professing Christian here to
   weigh the charges as they come against himself, and say how far they
   concern him. And now to close. A few words by way of--

   III. SUGGESTIONS FOR AMENDMENT.

   It is idle to be always regretting, but never reforming--to be forever
   confessing, but never making an advance in the right direction. Now,
   first, dear Brothers and Sisters--sitting here tonight while Gods'
   gracious rain is falling on the earth, may His rain fall on our
   hearts--let us admire the condescension of God that He should say, "I
   have been a Husband unto you." It is a depth of Grace that He who made
   the Heaven and the earth and who is infinitely great and glorious,
   should condescend to come into anything like such a relation as this
   with His poor creatures whom He has made and whose breath is in their
   nostrils. Oh, what a stoop--from the highest loftiness of Glory--to
   call Himself a Husband to a worm!

   Adore next, I pray you, the faithfulness with which hitherto God has
   carried out this relationship. I have asked you to remember it. Now,
   adoringly bow your hearts at the thought of it. Oh, God, we bless You,
   You have not left us. We praise Your name that You have continued so
   truly a Husband to our souls and that notwithstanding all our sin, and
   care, and woe!

   Let us, Brothers and Sisters, from henceforth seek to love the Lord
   foremost. A great man, taking his wife with him to a noble
   entertainment that was given by Cyrus, was asked by her husband on his
   return what she thought of Darius, and she replied, "I never thought of
   Darius. I never thought of anybody but my Husband." And oh, were it not
   a grand thing if our hearts chiefly thought of God? Other things must,
   of course, come across the mind and, for a while, engross it, but the
   first free thought of the Believer should be of the Glorious One who
   loved him from before the world--and will love him when the world has
   passed away!

   And as we set God first in our love, so, next, let us try tonight that
   we set Him first in all our actions. "Seek you first--first--the
   Kingdom of God and His righteousness." Let the supreme aim of life be
   not business, not the family, not personal pleasure, but our God! Let
   all be secondary and subordinate to Him. Set Him on high in your spirit
   and let everything contribute to His service and Kingdom.

   And that being done, let us seek to dwell with our God. This is the
   true and effective way of reforming. Instead of having breaks of
   communion, little periods of it now and then, like oases in the desert,
   we should seek to have constant communion with Him. What a delightful
   hymn that is--

   "Son of my soul, You Savior dear!" We often sing it. I wish we could
   practice it and that it were ours always, to abide with Him, because
   without Him we could not live and without Him we dare not die. May we
   learn the art of fellowship with God in the turmoil of business. To
   have fellowship with God in the closet, in the study, or in the chamber
   is not always easy, but to have fellowship with Him in the noise of
   busy life is difficult--but to this we ought to attain. May we be able
   to attain to it, so that we may never leave the society of Christ, go
   where we may.

   And, Brothers and Sisters, if there is anything that we have not done
   for Christ, anything that we could do now, tonight, anything that we
   feel we ought to do tomorrow, let us do it! Let us not be saying that
   we have left undone these things, but let us set to work to do them.
   The wife gives to her husband her whole self--let us give to our loving
   God our whole spirit, soul and body! Be it our prayer that there may
   not be an unconsecrated hair upon our heads, not a single heaving of
   the lungs, nor a circulation of the blood, but what in the whole shall
   be acknowledged. We would not desire to keep even a little spot for the
   flesh, or make provision for the lusts thereof. Pray that God would
   sanctify us wholly. Oh, God, do this! And it will be best for us to
   turn the whole subject into an earnest, loving, longing prayer. Oh, You
   who are a Husband to my soul, come to me, visit me! I know I have
   offended You, but Your mercy is great. Reveal Yourself to me! I am cold
   and dead, and like a clod of earth, but Lord, You can make the clod a
   star, to burn as fire and shine as gloriously as the sun! Only Your
   Presence I want, and my sins will flee, and my weakness be swallowed up
   in strength. If I am unholy, Your Presence though Jesus Christ shall
   put my sins away. If I am dead, Your Presence would be my life! Oh
   come, Lord, come to me for Jesus' sake!

   Now, I know that to some here all this seems like an idle tale. Well,
   well dear Friends, I wish it were not so! But you must be born-again
   and until you are born-again you will not understand this. But if you
   do not understand this simple talk which Believers have with one
   another, depend upon it, you will never be able to enter where they
   sing in nobler notes before the Throne of God! May God convince you of
   your need of a Savior and bring you to put your trust in Jesus, for
   there is life in Him, and in Him, alone! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 55; JEREMIAH30:1-11.

   It is the language of Infinite Mercy, speaking to the abject condition
   of mankind. We have become naked, poor and miserable through sin and,
   God, instead of driving us from His Presence, comes loaded with
   mercy--and thus He speaks to us.

   Verse 1. Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that
   has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price. See the freeness of Divine love? See
   how God, who knows the needs of souls, provides all things necessary
   for them--water--the Water of Life and, as if that were not enough, the
   wine of joy, the milk of satisfaction--and He offers these freely! Yes,
   He stands like the salesman crying in the market, and cries, "Ho! Ho!
   Everyone that thirsts!" But, mark, there is no gain for Him--the gain
   is for ourselves--for He says, "He that has no money, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price." All that you need, dear Friend, God
   is ready to give you! Yes, He invites you to come and receive it! He
   presses upon you the good things of the Covenant of Grace. Why do you
   stand back? Do you want these good things? Then come and welcome! It is
   God who bids you come.

   2. Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? And your labor
   for that which satisfies not? Why do you seek to get comfort for your
   souls where you will never get it? Why do you try to content your
   immortal nature upon things that will die? There is nothing here below
   that can satisfy you! Why spend your money, then, for these things, and
   your labor for nothing?

   2. Hearken diligently unto Me and eat you that which is good, and let
   your soul delight itself in fatness. God has real food for your
   soul--something that will make you truly happy. He will satisfy you,
   not with the name of goodness, but with the reality of it if you will
   but come and have it! You shall have fullness--you shall have
   delight--if you are but willing to come and receive it!

   3. Incline your ear and come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall
   live--Then who would not hear--who would not give attention--if by that
   attention immortal life may be received?

   3. And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David. Will God enter into Covenant with sinful men--with
   thirsty men--with hungry men--with needy men--with guilty men? Ah, that
   He will! "I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David."

   4. Behold, I have given Him--That is, the Son of David, Jesus the
   Christ, "I have given Him."

   4. For a Witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
   If you need anyone to tell you what God is, Jesus Christ is the Witness
   to the Character of God! Do you need a leader to lead you back to peace
   and happiness--a commander by whose power you may be able to fight
   Satan and all the powers of darkness that hold you in bondage? God has
   given His Son to be such a Leader to you! Oh, who would not enlist
   beneath His banner?

   5. Behold, You shall call a nation that You know not, and nations that
   knew You not shall run unto You because of the LORD, Your God, and for
   the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You. Here God speaks to
   Jesus, whom He hasmade a Commander, and He tells Him that He shall not
   be without a people, for those who never knew Him shall come to Him.
   There are some in this house tonight who have not yet yielded
   themselves to Christ--some of whom He will say, "Tonight I must abide
   in your house"--and when that Voice of power is heard, their hearts
   will yield and they will become the disciples of Jesus!

   6. Seek you the LORD while He may be found. And that is tonight, for
   the promise of finding is still given to everyone who seeks.

   6. Call you upon Him while He is near And He is near, for in all places
   where His name is recorded, there He has promised to be. Wherever the
   Gospel is preached, we have Christ's word for it--"Lo, I am with you
   always." So, then, call upon Him while He is near.

   7-9. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD and He will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts are
   not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the LORD. For as
   the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your
   ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts. Oh, that we could rise to
   God's thoughts--that we could speak His thoughts of love--that we could
   really believe that He is ready, now, to receive and forgive us, and
   could, therefore, fly into His arms without hesitancy or delay! God
   help us to do it!

   10-11. For as the rain comes down and the snow from Heaven, and returns
   not there, but waters the earth and makes it bring forth and bud, that
   it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall My Word
   be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto Me, void,
   but it shall accomplish that which Iplease, and it shall prosper in the
   thing whereto I sent it Trust, then, in the Gospel, which is the Word
   of God, for it cannot fail you! Rest yourselves in the Divine promise
   of pardon, for it cannot drop to the ground. It must accomplish the
   Divine Will!

   12. For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
   mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and
   all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. "For," if you do
   this--if you forsake your sins--if you turn unto God--God can make such
   joy in the heart that all the world shall be full of joy! When a man
   feels that his sins are forgiven, then Nature seems replete with ditty
   and the hills, rocks and trees all proclaim the Presence of a gracious
   God! Until then, when the heart is heavy, Nature seems dull and
   dreary--but oh, may the Grace of God so light up our hearts that all
   the world may be lit up for us.

   13. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the
   brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a
   name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

   JEREMIAH 30:1-11.

   Verses 1, 2. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, Thus
   speaks the LORD God ofIsrael, saying, Write you all the words that I
   have spoken unto you in a book.Too good to be lost! The Prophets said
   much when they did not write, but this particular Chapter and the next
   were to be carefully written down. God here begins to deal with His
   guilty people in a way of love and mercy. It is a very strange Chapter,
   one of the richest, one of the most cheering in the whole of God's
   Word! Therefore, write it in a book.

   3. For, lo, the days come, says the LORD, that I will bring again the
   captivity of My people Israel and Judah, says the LORD: and I will
   cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they
   shall possess it Souls get into captivity. God has ways of restoring
   them. Tonight I expect, and believe, that many captives will be
   restored by the Grace of God to rest and comfort! Will you be one of
   them? Poor Mourner, pray now that you may be! Ask God that tonight He
   may give you freedom from your captivity.

   4, 5. And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and
   concerning Judah. For thus says the LORD: We have heard a voice of
   trembling, of fear, and not of peace. "Why" you say, "I thought you
   began to read words of comfort. Now there is a drop!" Yes, there always
   is. Whenever God is going to comfort a man, He first makes him see his
   need of comfort. There is always stripping before there is clothing! On
   God's part there is always emptying before there is filling.

   6. Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? Why do I
   see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and
   all faces are turned into paleness? Everywhere, when the time of mercy
   came, it was a bad time, a dark time--a time of inward throbs, throes
   and travail.

   7. Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the
   time of Jacob's trouble: but he shall be saved out of it. But he shall
   be saved out of it! What a flash of lightning across the black face of
   the cloud. "He shall be saved out of it."

   8, 9. For it shall come topass in that day, says the LORD ofHHosts,
   that I will break hisyoke from offyour neck, and will burst your bonds,
   and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him. But they shall
   serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up
   unto them. See how the Chapter has gotten back to the comforting strain
   again? After the bass notes, we run up the scale. We have come to
   comfort again! I should not wonder if we have to go back, however, for
   so it is--God's mercy is a checkered work, black and white, sorrow and
   salvation.

   10, 11. Therefore fear you not, O My servant, Jacob, says the LORD,
   neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from afar and
   your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return and
   shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. What a
   beautiful collection of words for a troubled heart! And they are not
   beautiful words only, but there is a deep, true meaning in them--"Shall
   be in rest and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid." I pray God
   that many here who are much afraid, and cannot be quiet, but are like
   the troubled sea which cannot rest, may get into this blissful state
   tonight!

   11. For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you. God may destroy the
   wicked, and He will--but not His people, His own beloved--His heart
   goes after them. "I will not make a full end of you."

   11. Though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you,
   yet will I not make a full end of you: but I will correct you in
   measure and will not leave you altogether unpunished. You will have to
   smart for it. If you are God's child, you will have to be brought home
   with many a tear and many a sigh. Your sorrow, tonight, is a part of a
   heavenly discipline by which you shall be saved!

Could He Not? Ah! But He Would Not

   (No. 3420)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And some of them saaid--Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the
   blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?" John
   11:37.

   HERE was very good reasoning. Jesus Christ had opened the eyes of the
   blind--could He not, therefore, have healed Lazarus of the disease
   which proved fatal? Of course He could! He who can avert one evil can
   avert another. It could have been no more difficult for Christ to have
   turned aside the fever, or whatever it may have been which afflicted
   Lazarus, than to have opened the eyes of a man who was born blind. The
   first was impossible, but that achieved, no difficulties remained.
   "Impossible" is a word which does not fall into language when you have
   to deal with Christ and, therefore, when He has once proved, by a
   miracle, that He is truly the Christ, then it is clear that, ever
   afterwards, nothing is difficult or impossible for Him.

   The same Truth of God, in another shape, holds good, namely, that when
   Christ has conferred one blessing, He can also confer another. He is
   not as we are, who, with one gift, have exhausted our stock and who can
   only bestow good wishes afterwards because we have no more means. But
   Jesus Christ is just as full of power as if He had never exerted that
   power. And after a thousand miracles, He is just as willing and as able
   to bestow further favors! One evil averted is a good argument that
   another can be--one good received is a good argument that another may
   be received from the same Divine hand!

   Stop a minute, therefore, and encourage your hearts with such reasoning
   as this. "The Lord that delivered you out of six troubles, can He not
   also deliver you out of the seventh? The Lord, who has been with you
   these 40 years in the wilderness, shall He leave you in this 45th or
   50th year? He that has brought you thus far and bestowed upon you early
   tokens of His faithfulness, is it a hard thing for you to believe that
   He will continue to do the same? You have been preserved out of many
   dangers--why not out of another? You have been provided in
   necessities--why not be provided for again? You have been raised up
   when most are cast down--why not raised up again? You have found a way
   out of the very depths, when the pains of Hell got hold upon you and
   the snares of the devil surrounded you--why can there not be a way
   found for another rescue?" The Lord that has done, can do, and is
   doing! That He has done so in the past is a guarantee that He will do
   so in the present and in the future! He has already made an
   investment--if I may so speak--of His love and of His Grace and of His
   faithfulness upon you and He will not lose what He has already spent,
   but He will carry on the good work to perfection, till He shall bring
   you to Himself in everlasting Glory! Comfort yourself, then, Christian,
   with this blessed remembrance of your past experience and rest assured
   that this Man, who opened your eyes when you were blind, can keep your
   life from spiritual death! Yes, and were you dead, yet should you live
   by His strength, for He is able to do exceeding abundantly above what
   you ask, or even think!

   The same encouragement may be suggested to any here who are anxious
   about their souls. The salvation of anyone ought to be an encouragement
   to any other. If God has saved one sinner, why not another? If the
   precious blood of Jesus has made one drunk sober, why not another? And
   if among the white-robed hosts there are some who had defiled their
   garments with the foulest stains, why should not I yet be there by the
   same blood-washing and the same mercy of my gracious God? He that
   opened the eyes of one blind man can open the eyes of all blind men if
   so it pleases Him--and He that gives perfect pardon and acceptance to
   one, can give to another the same, wherever He chooses to bestow them!
   Let no man despair! There are examples of great sinners saved on
   purpose to encourage others to trust in Christ. I care not how
   aggravated your sins may have been, I am quite sure they have been
   already paralleled in some other cases--in some other cases, too, where
   salvation has ultimately come! You are not beyond the Divine range. You
   have not sinned yourself yet into Hell. Mercy yet can reach you! The
   blood can yet cleanse you! The Divine bosom can yet receive you and
   even the Heaven of God can yet find room for you, though you are the
   chief of sinners! This is good argument, we say--this which was used by
   Jesus. What has been done can be done. If Christ does one form of good,
   He can do another. If He opens the eyes of the blind man, He can cause
   that the sick shall not die!

   But now, after that encouragement, there comes up a great difficulty.
   It is certain that if Christ had willed it, Lazarus need not have died.
   Then Mary need not have sat still in the house weeping. Then Martha
   need not have said, with sorrow and with a broken heart, "Lord, if You
   had been here, my brother had not died." There was no need that Lazarus
   should suffer all that pain, all that languishing and pass through the
   gates of the grave--no absolute need for it! Christ could, if He had
   chosen, have prevented that man from dying and, what is more, if Christ
   willed it, He could prevent all your troubles and all mine. If He
   chose, none of His people need ever have so much as a headache, or a
   pin's prick of the finger! They need not, one of them, ever be poor, or
   have any losses or any crosses. They need, none of them, ever be
   tempted, for He could chain up the devil. They need, none of them die,
   for He could take them up to Heaven, like Elijah, or translate them,
   like Enoch. It stands proof positive, if He could open the eyes of the
   blind, He could, if He would, prevent any of His people from sickness,
   from death and from all other ills! It were possible for Christ, if He
   so willed it, to avert all our sufferings and all our losses from us.
   Then why does He not do it? ' 'Behold how He loved him!" said the Jews,
   and yet the next thing they said was, "Well, but if He opened the eyes
   of the blind, could He not, if He had willed it, have prevented this
   man's dying?" Yet He did not do it--and Lazarus died."

   Now, I am quite sure, Brothers and Sisters, if you had a dear one at
   home that was sick, and I came in to see you, and I could, with a word,
   raise your sick friend, I dare not go out of your room without doing
   it! You would feel very grieved with me if I did. You would think it
   very unkind and, moreover, I am sure I could not find it in my heart
   not to do it. Speak a word? Why, I would speak any number of words, if
   I could raise your sick ones from being sick, and keep them from dying!
   You would think me very unkind if I did not, and so these Jews could
   not comprehend it. They said of Christ that He burst into tears at the
   thought of Lazarus being dead! They said, as they saw Him in that
   genuine burst of sacred passion, "Behold how He loved him!" And they
   could not comprehend it, that with a power which could open the eyes of
   the blind, and which must be sufficient to prevent the death of
   Lazarus, yet He did not prevent it, but the loving Christ allowed His
   friend, Lazarus, to sleep till he was laid four days in the grave and
   His body began to stink with corruption!

   Brothers and Sisters, we are now about to look the question in the
   face--and what shall we say about it? The first thing we shall say
   about it is this, that--

   I. IT IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT FOR US TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AS TO THE LOVE AND
   THE WISDOM OF OUR LORD.

   It may seem a very strange thing to us that He does not prevent the
   afflictions which are so grievous, and that He does not give us some of
   those mercies which we think would make us so comfortable. But we have
   no right to ask questions. A servant must not be always asking his
   master, "Why do you do this?" Or, "Why do you do that?" And the scholar
   is not expected to understand all the doings of the professor at whose
   feet he sits. A master-builder would soon discharge the carpenter on
   the work who should always be saying, "Why should that piece of timber
   be of that shape," or, "Why must those stones be placed in such a
   position?" The architect is supposed to know the plan, not the Irish
   laborer! It is enough for the architect to know, without every small
   body on the work understanding everything that is to be done. We are
   not, therefore, to be always asking questions. There is another spirit
   that ought to rule us, rather than the spirit of captious criticism. A
   man goes and takes stones, and he puts some of them into the earth,
   deep down. Some of them He places higher up, one upon another. Some he
   daubs with mortar, some he places where they cannot be seen and some he
   polishes and puts into the corners. Are the stones to say to the
   builder, "Why do you place me here?" Or, "Why do you place me there?"
   The potter takes his lumps of clay and puts them on his knees--and one
   vessel is made to dishonor and another is made a graceful form to
   honor--but shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, "Why do you
   make me thus?" It is not for the thing that is created to begin to
   question its Creator, for then the Creator might well reply, "Who are
   you and where were you when I made the Heaven and the earth? When I
   balanced the clouds and laid the foundations of the earth? Declare now,
   if you can answer Me!" That wonderful sermon from the mouth of God
   Himself, at the close of the book of Job rolls like crashes of thunder
   over our heads and makes us cower down conscious of our insignificance!
   And when we dare to lift up our heads once more, we find upon our lips
   words like those which came from the mouth of Job, "I have heard of You
   by the hearing of ear, but now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor
   myself and repent in dust and ashes." For you and for me to think to
   understand God is as though some tiny insect, whose whole life was
   comprehended in an hour, should expect to understand the marches of the
   heavens and to comprehend the revolutions of the spheres! The child by
   your side, taking up a shell full of water, has no idea of what the sea
   is, and you, when you look at God's ways, see no more of God's ways
   than that little shell full, as it were, compared with the sea! Stand
   still and see that He is God! Let Him be exalted in the earth! Yes, let
   Him be exalted in the heavens! He gives no account of His matters. He
   does as He wills in the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of
   this lower earth. Ah, Lord, it is better for us to lie passive in Your
   hands than to be attempting to sit upon Your Throne, holding the
   balance and judging Your work! What if He does not make me rich, but
   lets me pine in poverty? What if He does not heal me, but allows me to
   linger out a life of sorrow? What if He does not bless my undertaking,
   but He permits heavy trials to overcome me? I will not ask Him why! "I
   was dumb with silence. I opened not my mouth because You did it"--that
   is the spirit in which we may look at this question. One thing more I
   want you to remember, and that is this--

   II. THAT WHATEVER GOD MAY DO OR MAY NOT DO WITH US, IT IS ALWAYS THE
   CHRISTIAN'S WISDOM TO STAND TO THIS--THAT CHRIST IS ALWAYS LOVE.

   The Jews said, "Behold how He loved him!" They could see that by His
   tears, though He let him die. Now, there were good reasons, though the
   Jews might not see the reasons and, Brothers and Sisters, there are
   good reasons why God withholds that right hand of His which is so full
   of bounty and why at other times He does stretch it out--and good
   reasons why He lifts that left hand of His which is so heavy to smite,
   and brings it down upon you, the chosen child of His heart! But do not
   think that Christ can be otherwise than kind? If you have trusted in
   Him, never believe that He can hate or forget you. Never think that He
   can suspend His affection towards you. No, never once will He deal with
   you according to any other rule than that of love--never once! The
   dispensation may be very dark, but judge not by appearances. Your
   conscience may be very guilty, but He is greater than your guilt. Your
   heart may condemn you, yet can He absolve you and His love is not
   measured by even your consciousness of His Presence. He has forgiven
   you and He will not visit you in wrath for sin! No, though Satan tells
   you that repeated strokes must argue an angry God, he is the father of
   lies from the beginning--believe not that which he suggests! It cannot
   be possible that God is unkind! The camels are destroyed, the oxen are
   stolen, the children have perished, the body is covered with sore
   boils, but, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him," says the
   triumphant Patriarch. "Shall we receive good from the hand of the Lord
   and shall we not receive evil? The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
   away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." Be then as Job was and as
   David was when, being about to describe the uneasiness of his mind on
   account of the affliction of the righteous, and the prosperity of the
   wicked, he began the Psalm by saying, "Truly God is good to Israel," as
   if he started with that and nothing could ever drive him from it!
   Though the wicked prospered and the righteous were chastened every
   morning, yet God was good to His own Covenant people in the most
   supreme and emphatic sense! But now let us come to this question,
   again, for it still looks difficult. If faith makes no enquiries and
   resignation shall be content, still--

   III. THERE IS DIFFICULTY.

   Let us see now. If Christ had prevented Lazarus's death, what would
   have happened?He might have done, if He had liked, but, in the first
   place, Christ would not have been glorified by raising Lazarus from the
   dead. If Lazarus does not die, he cannot be raised, and that
   manifestation of miraculous power could not be evinced. You will let
   Lazarus die, then--you all agree to that--that Christ may have an
   opportunity of raising him again. See, then, if you do not have a
   trouble--and Christ can prevent it if He wills--but if you are not
   brought into trouble, you cannot have the deliverance, Christ cannot
   put out His hand of love to save you, if there is nothing to save you
   from! Oh, then, be quite content to bear trouble, in order that your
   blessed Lord Jesus may make Himself illustrious as He comes to you in
   the very nick of time and delivers you out of the depth of your
   distress!

   In the next place, if Lazarus had not died, Lazarus himself would not
   have been so honored. Everybody said afterwards, "That is Lazarus whom
   Christ raised from the dead." He was a marked man and I am sure if you
   were Lazarus, you would say, "Ah, well, it is worthwhile to die to be
   raised again to have the honor of such a favor." Now, Beloved, if you
   are not tried and troubled, you cannot become one of the experienced
   saints! It cannot be said of you by your Brothers and Sisters, "That
   man has passed through six troubles and through seven, and yet the
   Lord's faithfulness has been proved in them all." You will miss great
   pleasure if you miss great affliction! Depend upon it, you will be more
   a loser by missing trouble than you have ever imagined!

   In the next place, Mary and Martha would not have had such a sweet
   lesson from Christ. Their poor eyes were red, I doubt not with their
   four days' weeping, and the previous days' watching and nursing. But
   then, oh what joy they had when they saw their dear brother restored
   again! Such a meeting did make amends for all the grief of parting! And
   though they had heard the Lord Jesus talk about the resurrection and
   the life, they heard that dear powerful voice cry, "Lazarus, come
   forth." Why, it was for their education, their spiritual profit and
   benefit that the Lord allows Lazarus to die! He might have prevented
   it, but they were such gainers by the affliction that it proved His
   love that He did not deny them the benefit of the trial!

   Mark, again, if Lazarus had not died, then those few would not have
   been converted because they saw Lazarus rise from the dead--and it is
   said, "Therefore, many of the Jews believed on Him." Well they might!
   It was a wonderful sermon to see a dead man come forth bound in his
   grave clothes! But how could he have thus come forth if he had not
   died? It was for the benefit of those spectators that the trial was
   allowed to come. Oh, you do not know, some of you, how many precious
   souls may have their destiny--speaking after the manner of men--wrapped
   up in your affliction! There is a necessity, for the good of others,
   that through your testimony others may believe--that you should be
   brought into the very depths and made to be sad, that afterwards God
   may interpose for your rescue!

   Yet again, the result of the resurrection of Lazarus was that our Lord
   rode in triumph through the streets of Jerusalem. There seems to me to
   be a connection between these two things. If you read the next Chapter,
   you find our Lord taken in triumph through the streets, with palm
   branches and great shouts. And probably that which moved the multitude
   to do it, the immediate cause, was this marvelous miracle which Christ
   had worked. Oh, Beloved, Christ often gets great triumph among the
   rolls of men from the deep trials of His people, out of which He does
   rescue them and shall not you and I be well content that He should
   stand back and hide His face and even seem to be an enemy to us, if,
   out of all this, His glory shall spring? If He shall get hosannas and
   shouting, and the waving of palm branches--and if men on earth and
   angels in Heaven shall do Him extraordinary homage because of the work
   He works in us--oh, shall we not be content that our choicest joys
   shall wither and our best comforts for a while shall die?

   In the case of Lazarus, you can all see that though he need not have
   died--in one respect Christ could have kept him alive--yet it was a
   great proof of love on Christ's part that Lazarus did die. Now, I
   believe that everything else that has happened in the world, if we had
   light enough to see it, would turn out to be the same. I know it is a
   difficult question, sometimes, to make out why God permits certain
   evils. When people say, as the Negro did, "Well, now, God is greater
   than de devil, why don't He kill de devil?" I am sure I cannot answer
   the question, but I am very well persuaded that if, on the whole, it
   would be the best thing to do, to kill the devil, He would do it! And
   it is, after all, in a most mysterious way, the best thing for His
   people, and the most glorious thing for Himself, that the devil should
   be permitted. The Fall--what a mysterious thing that is! It might have
   been prevented. I cannot hold any limit to the Omnipotence of God--if
   He had willed it, there need not have been a Fall. Then why did He
   permit it? I reply to that in the same spirit. I do not know, and I do
   not want to know--but I think I can see such a display of Divine Mercy,
   and Love and Grace, and every other attribute, in the redemption of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, that the Fall, terrible thing as it was, seems to be
   a grand platform on which the Glory of God could be displayed!

   When the Lord brought His people out of Egypt, they might have gone
   right straight to Canaan. Why did He not take them there at once? Why
   did He make them go round by the Red Sea and come to that difficult
   place? Why--why did He not, indeed? They would not have had half the
   fears, nor half the terrors. No, but then remember, there would not
   have been so many Egyptians drowned. And there would not have been such
   grand shouts, nor such sweet clashing of Miriam's cymbals, nor such
   beating of timbrels, nor such dancing of nimble feet. And they would
   not have said, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously;
   the horse and his rider, He has cast into the sea!" All the difficulty
   only led to a greater triumph! God was glorified! His enemies were put
   to confusion and His people's memories were stored with thoughts of the
   mighty works of God which might stimulate their faith as long as the
   world should stand. It is best as it is. God orders all things right,
   after all, and though He might prevent this, and does not, and He might
   give us that, and does not, we believe it is all for the best and bow
   our heads, and wait till the light shines, that we may understand more
   of the reason why.

   Now, Beloved, the point I want to come to is this--depend upon it, that
   as I have proved in the case of Lazarus, it was the best thing that the
   worst thing should happen--so it is in your case! You are in trouble
   tonight. Now, Christ could have prevented it, could have carried you to
   Heaven on a featherbed if He had chosen. He could have made you ride to
   Heaven all the way in a chariot that never jolted--on a paved road
   right straight up to Paradise, without a single rut, or any stones on
   it--but He chose not to do so. Now--

   IV. LET US SEE IF WE CANNOT FIND A REASON.

   If we cannot, it will not matter if you believe it is right. Still we
   will try. The roughness of the road that you are travailing now, may it
   not be necessary to wean you from this world? Oh, but the goods of this
   world are like bird lime to birds--they stick to our feet and keep us
   from mounting towards Heaven. "Ah," said one, as he looked abroad on
   his gardens and house and park, "these are the things that make it hard
   to die." Yes, and these are the things that make it hard to live near
   to God! When a man's heart begins to be content with the things of this
   world. When he finds his satisfaction here, he is not inclined to look
   up to his God. Now, perhaps you are one of that kind that could not
   bear too much prosperity. Every gardener will tell you that there are
   some of his flowers that he cannot put in the glare of the sun, for
   they would never do there. So with you--you grow better in the shade.
   Your nearness to Heaven and your soul's health require this affliction.

   Besides, may it not be that this affliction is sent on purpose to try
   your faith because it is weak? "What?" you say, "Try my faith because
   it is weak? I thought you would have said not try it because it is
   weak." Ah, but faith grows by trial. When faith is weak, a too heavy
   trial would crush it, but a suitable trial is ruled by God for the
   strengthening of it. You must--you must grow! The Lord would not have
   His children be stunted and dwarfed--and this trial is sent that you
   may be made to grow.

   Further, you may not only be made to grow in faith this way, but also
   in close communion with your God. I have read lately one old Puritan
   whose opinion is that we never grow, except in affliction. I could not
   endorse that, but I am afraid there is a great deal of truth in it, for
   almost all the sunshiny days we have, we waste, and when God is very
   gracious to us in temporals, we generally find that these lean cattle
   of our ingratitude will eat up the fat cattle of God's mercies! We grow
   best, depend upon it, when the wind blows us away from our natural
   havens to the great Port of Peace which is found in communion with God
   in Christ Jesus! When our soul has nowhere else to fly to for shelter,
   she flies to Christ. When she sees all her crutches and all her props
   broken away, and all her foundations made to reel, then she casts her
   arms about her own dear Lord and there she hangs in rapture and simple
   child-like love and confidence! And she is brought nearer to God than
   she ever was by the strength of her trials--and that is always a Divine
   result, a Divinely valuable result. It is a great mercy, if nothing
   else should come of it--a great mercy to have troubles if they should
   have this result!

   Brothers and Sisters, if Christ would, He could prevent our having
   affliction, but He will not prevent them because He wants to make
   something of us. For instance, He wants to make some of us to be
   comforters to others, but how can you comfort others in trouble when
   you have never experienced the like? Oh, what poor hands some of us
   make in trying to comfort some of God's saints who have been in much
   deeper water than we have ever sailed on! Why, we find they look upon
   us as mere boys and wonder how we have the impertinence to bring
   consolation to them! But when we can say, "I have just experienced the
   very trial you are now passing through--and the Lord sanctified it and
   supported me under it." then the mourner opens wide his ears and the
   soul receives our comfort as though it were honey dropping from the
   comb!

   My dear Brothers and Sisters, you will never be qualified to understand
   and explains some of the promises without trials. Some of God's
   promises cannot be read except by the firelight of affliction. There is
   a kind of invisible ink that people sometimes use, which does not show
   till you hold it to the fire--and some of the promises seem to be
   written in that kind of ink. You do not understand them until you get a
   trial, but in the trial you find out that God has fitted every word of
   the consolation to the Providence in which He has placed you. But,
   indeed, my Brothers and Sisters, when I consider the infinite variety
   of blessings which come to us drawn by the team of black horses that
   our Father always keeps for this purpose. When I consider how God is
   glorified by the endurance of the saints and by the Divine Graces which
   they receive in consequence of tribulation. When I consider how their
   joy will be swollen at the last, when they come to their rest, by the
   remembrance of their pilgrimage here below, I can but think that it is
   a fine mark of special mercy that God does not allow His people to go
   into the fat fields of unbroken prosperity, but into the fields of
   trial and of trouble-- that they may be enriched and that their souls
   may be established.

   Come then, let every murmuring thought be gone! Let every dark
   suspicion be discarded. Let us kiss the hand that smites us, and look
   up to our Father's face, even when He chastens us! And in this way we
   shall soon find the trial turn to joy, the bitter cup will become sweet
   and resignation will sweeten all!

   If these words shall have ministered any consolation to God's suffering
   ones, my heart shall be glad. I sometimes need such thoughts, myself,
   and there are times when if I could have them spoken to me by somebody
   else, they would be to me like the paths of God which drop with
   fatness. Now there may be some of you--I know you are tried and
   troubled--to whom this will be just the very word. If so, do not let
   Satan take it away from you. Do lay hold of it by faith and feed upon
   it with joy and comfort. Yes. "Comfort you, comfort you, My people,
   says your God. Speak comfortably unto Jerusalem." So I would that you
   may be happy and a rejoicing people in the midst of all your troubles.

   But, alas, this does not belong to all of you. It is only comfort to
   those who belong to Christ--some of you do not belong to Him and have
   never trusted Him. The Lord bring you this very night to believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ! Those about to be baptized say to you tonight, "We
   avow ourselves to be Believers in Jesus! We are buried in water to show
   that we desire to be dead to all the world and buried in the death of
   Christ. We rise out of it to show that we desire to live in newness of
   life by the quickening power of the Resurrection of Christ."

   You will have no right to this ordinance until you have trusted the
   Savior. When you have trusted Him. When you have relied fully upon Him.
   When He becomes All-in-All to you, then may you take the sign, because
   the thing signified is yours!

   May the Lord bless you, for Jesus' sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM119:25-40.

   By the help of God's Holy Spirit, this Psalm may serve for the purposes
   of self-examination, for we may ask ourselves as we read, "Do I feel
   that way? Are my prayers like those of this good man? Is my experience
   like his?" We may often ask ourselves, "Am I as watchful, as careful
   and as fond of God's Word as he was?" Such questions will do us good.

   Verse 25. My soul cleaves unto the dust: quicken You me according to
   Your Word. He does not like to feel the cleaving of his soul to the
   dust. There are some that feel it, and they seem content to continue in
   that condition. But no sooner does David feel it than he cries "Quicken
   You me." A sense of sin is of small value unless it leads us to desire
   to escape out of it. "Quicken You me. I lie as dead as if it were dust
   to dust. My soul seems cleaving to it, as if it had come to its own,
   and meant to rest there! But, Lord, give me life. Your Word promises me
   life. You have ways laid down in Your Word for giving life. Quicken You
   me according to Your Word."

   26. I have declared my ways, and You heard me: teach me Your statuesI
   have told you all about myself. Now tell me about Yourself. "Teach me
   Your statutes."

   27. Make me to understand the way of Your precepts: so shall I talk of
   Your wondrous works. It is a bad thing to talk of what we do not
   understand. And he who shall preach what he has never experienced is
   very likely to do so. Yet Beloved, there is no understanding God's
   precepts except He shall teach them to us. We are void of
   understanding. He must enlighten. He must instruct. "Make me to
   understand the way of Your precepts." Some are very anxious to
   understand the doctrines, and some to understand the prophecies. All
   well and good, but, "Make me to understand the way of Your precepts."
   Give me practical godliness. Help me to live to Your praise, "so shall
   I talk of Your wondrous works." I will not talk till You have taught
   me. But when You have taught me, then my subject shall be Your wondrous
   works. The wondrous work of making me to understand--You shall be
   something to speak about! And all the wondrous works of Nature,
   Providence and Grace shall be the subject of my continual conversation.

   28. My soul melts for heaviness--For the best of men sometimes suffer
   the sharpest sorrows. Hearts of stone are not likely to be so sensitive
   as hearts of flesh. "My soul melts for heaviness."

   28. Strengthen You me according unto Your Word. He wants strength, but
   he does not want to obtain it in any way but the way of God's
   appointment. "According unto Your Word." Somewhat like our hymn, which
   says--

   "He that suffered in my stead, Shall my physician be. I will not be
   comforted Till Jesus comforts me."

   "Strengthen You me," but let it be "according to Your Word."

   29. Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me Your Law graciously.
   Let me not lie. Let me not be tempted to lie. Let me not be pestered
   with the lies of others. Remove the way of lying far from me and oh, by
   Your Grace, give me to know the Law. That is a remarkable combination
   of words. "Grant me Your Law graciously." Has Law anything to do with
   Grace? Yes, such a Law as he speaks of--the Law in the heart--the Law
   in the hand of Christ--the Law written in the life of the Believer--not
   the law of merit and of Salvation by works, but, "grant me Your Law
   graciously."

   30. I have chosen the way of truth: Your judgments have I laid before
   me. As a seaman spreads out the chart before him, that he may follow
   the right channel and not miss his track--as a traveler spreads out his
   map that he may keep to the right way. "I have chosen the way of truth.
   Your judgments have I laid before me."

   31. I have stuck unto Your testimonies. As if I were glued to
   them--sealed to them. They said I was very old-fashioned. They said I
   did not keep pace with the times. They said I was not a man of thought.
   I did not care about that. "I have stuck unto Your testimonies."

   31. O LORD, put me not to shame. And He never will! If we stick to Him,
   we may be quite sure that we shall come forth out of every difficulty
   and every opposition triumphantly!. "Put me not to shame." And although
   he thus spoke, yet you perceive the activity of his soul.

   32. I will run the way of Your commandments, when You shall enlarge my
   heart Give my heart freedom. Knock off my fetters. Take away my
   heaviness. Remove from me my ignorance. Give my soul room and she will
   run, but it will be in the ways of Your commandments.

   33. Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes, and I shall keep them
   unto the end. Here is the art of finally persevering. Here is the way
   of continuing to the end--and the same shall be saved. We must begin
   with a teachable spirit. He that is not willing to learn, has not begun
   a right. We ought to disciple all nations, but he who will not learn is
   not yet discipled. "Teach me." But the teaching we must have must come
   from God. "Teach me, O Lord. I am not content to have the Word
   secondhand. Be You my schoolmaster. Teach me, O Lord. I shall never
   learn unless You teach me. You who did make me. You who did give me a
   new heart. You must write that Law upon my heart, or it will never be
   written there. Teach me, O Lord. Teach me the way of Your statutes.
   Teach me practical godliness. So teach it to me that I stall learn it
   and put it into practice. And if I am taught of You, then I shall keep
   it unto the end."

   34. Give me understanding and I shall keep Your Law: yes, I shall
   observe it with my whole heart A want of understanding is a very great
   lack. There is little wonder that men turn aside from an outward
   religion which has never taken possession of their thoughts and minds.
   If they only subscribe to the creed which they have never studied. If
   they only carry out a life--the mere shell of a life--the inward
   principles of which they do not know, they will soon turn aside. "Give
   me understanding and I shall keep Your Law."

   35. Make me go in the path of Your commandments; for therein do I
   delight "Not only teach me the way, but make me go in it! Take hold of
   me as a mother does her little child, and teach me how to walk and help
   me in the walking." Make me go. It is a feeble word--a most expressive
   prayer. "Make me go, for therein do I delight." When a man delights in
   God's way, he will be sure to be made to go in it.

   36. Incline my heart unto Your testimonies. Bend it that way--incline
   it.

   36. And not to covetousness. For, naturally, my heart would go after
   the world and cleave to its riches, its treasures, and begin to covet!
   But, Lord, bend it the other way. If you do not love God's testimonies,
   the tendency will be to become a lover of the world. "Incline my heart
   unto Your testimonies and not to covetousness."

   37. Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity. Or, "make my eyes to pass
   from beholding vanity." I am a runner in the race. Do not let me stop
   to look at anything, but may my eyes pass by vanity. Let me not be like
   she in the fable who paused to gather the golden apples in the
   race--and so lost it and was deceived. If the world's golden apples are
   thrown in my way, make my eyes to pass from beholding vanity.

   37. And quicken You me in Your way. More life towards You will deaden
   me to the world. The more I follow after God, the less shall I care to
   follow after the world.

   38. Establish Your Word unto Your servant Make it fast, firm, sure.

   38. Who is devoted to Your fear. I am established in You. Establish the
   Word in me. You have bound me fast to Your altar. Oh, give me the fast
   blessings and sure mercies of David!

   39. Turn away my reproach which I fear: for Your judgments are good. I
   fear lest I bring a reproach upon You, and then upon myself. Oh, suffer
   me not to do so! I am not afraid of the reproach of the world. I count
   the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.
   But, oh, let them never have to charge me with sin and let me not fall
   into such pecuniary difficulties or other troubles, that men will be
   able to make a charge against me out of them. Help me to provide things
   honest in the sight of all men. "Take away my reproach, which I fear,
   for Your judgments are good."

   40. Behold, I have longed after Your precepts: quicken me in Your
   righteousness.

Prayer Meetings

   (No. 3421)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORDS-DAY EVENING, AUGUST
   30, 1868.

   "These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication." Acts
   1:14.

   IN all those churches which are not altogether tied and bound by
   liturgies and rituals, it has been common to hold meetings for social
   prayer. We call them Prayer Meetings. Now, it may be profitable, now
   and then, to look over some of our institutions, to see whether they
   are Scriptural--to notice their defects, to see in what respect they
   may be improved, or to observe their merits--that we may be induced
   still further to carry them on. The subject, therefore, this evening,
   suggested to me by the fact that we are going to meet for a day of
   prayer tomorrow, is that of Prayer Meetings-- assemblies of the people
   of God for worship of that peculiar kind which consists in each one
   expressing his desire before the Lord. Let us, then, go through very
   briefly--

   I. THE APOSTOLIC HISTORY OF MEETINGS FOR PRAYER.

   These meetings must have been very common, indeed. They were,
   doubtless, everyday things, but still there are some few records of the
   facts connected with them which may be instructive. The first meeting
   for prayer which we find after our Lord's Ascension to Heaven is the
   one mentioned in the text--and we are led from it to remark that united
   prayer is the comfort of a disconsolate Church Can you judge of the
   sorrow which filled the hearts of the disciples when their Lord was
   gone from them? They were an army without a leader, a flock without a
   shepherd, a family without a head. Exposed to innumerable trials, the
   strong, brazen wall of His Presence, which had been round about them,
   was now withdrawn. In the deep desolation of their spirits they
   resorted to prayer. They were like a flock of sheep that will huddle
   together in a storm, or come closer, each to its fellow, when they hear
   the sound of the wolf. Poor defenseless creatures as they were, they
   yet loved to come together and would die together if necessary. They
   felt that nothing made them so happy, nothing so emboldened them,
   nothing so strengthened them to bear their daily difficulties as to
   draw near to God in common supplication! Beloved, let every Church
   learn the value of its Prayer Meetings in its dark hours! When the
   pastor is dead, and when it has been difficult to find a suitable
   successor. When, it may be, there are problems and divisions. When
   death falls upon honored members, when poverty comes in, when there is
   a spiritual dearth, when the Holy Spirit appears to have withdrawn
   Himself--there is but one remedy for these and a thousand other
   evils--and that one remedy is contained in this short sentence, "Let us
   pray." Those churches which are now writing, "Ichabod," on their walls
   and who sorrowfully confess that the congregation is slowly dwindling,
   might soon restore their numbers if they did but know how to pray!
   Brothers and Sisters, though they are dispirited, now, defeat would
   then soon become success, their spirits being revived by drawing near
   to God! And if any of you are personally afflicted and troubled in your
   estate, you shall find that after coming up to the House of God, your
   own private prayer chamber will be peculiarly comforting to you! And
   after that, come and unite with the saints of God who have, probably,
   all of them, experienced assaults like yours. And as you hear them
   pouring out sighs similar to yours and making requests such as you
   would make, but scarcely know how to word them, you will see the
   footprints of the flock and, by-and-by, you shall see the Shepherd,
   Himself! One of the first uses of the Prayer Meeting, then, is to
   encourage a discouraged people.

   Again, if you look at the Second Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
   you will perceive that the Prayer Meeting is the place for the
   reception of Divine Power. "They were all with one accord in one
   place," making their prayers and, as they waited there, suddenly they
   heard the sound as of a rushing, mighty wind, and the cloven tongues
   descended upon them and they were clothed with the power which Jesus
   had promised them. And what a difference it made in them!
   Commonfishermen became the extraordinary messengers of Heaven!
   Illiterate men spoke with tongues that they had never, themselves,
   heard! They began to reveal mysteries which had not been revealed to
   philosophers or kings! These men were lifted out of the level of
   ordinary humanity and became God-Inspired, filled with the Deity,
   Himself, who came to dwell in their hearts and minds! The result was
   that poor wavering Peter became bold as a lion and the impetuous John,
   who would have called fire from Heaven upon the Samaritans, had another
   fire fall upon him--one not to destroy, but to rescue and bless!

   Now, the great need of the Church in all times is the power of the Holy
   Spirit. "I believe in the Holy Spirit," says the Creed, but how many,
   or rather how few are there who really do believe in Him? There is a
   mysterious, supernatural energy which comes from the Third Person of
   the Blessed Trinity which really, at this day, falls upon men--as
   really as when Peter spoke with unknown tongues or worked miracles. And
   though the power of working miracles is not given now, yet spiritual
   power is given and this spiritual power is as manifest, and just as
   certainly with us, today, if we possess the Spirit, as it was with the
   Apostles! Now, if we want to get this, the most likely place in which
   to find it is the Prayer Meeting. I will guarantee you that the best
   teachers of the school, the men who are of the right spirit, are those
   who will be found here tomorrow evening. I will guarantee you that the
   best ministers are those who do not despise the gathering of the people
   of God! And I am sure that the cream of the Christian Church will be
   found on the whole--of course, other things are to be considered,
   too--among those who most commonly assemble for prayer. Oh, yes, this
   is the place to meet with the Holy Spirit and this is the way to get
   His mighty power! If we would have Him, we must meet in greater
   numbers! We must pray with greater fervency, we must watch with greater
   earnestness and believe with firmer steadfastness! The Prayer Meeting,
   then, has this second use--that it is the appointed place for the
   reception of power!

   The next incident in this Apostolic history you will find in the Fourth
   Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, and there you will see that the
   Prayer Meeting is the resource of a persecuted Church. Turn to the 31st
   verse. Peter and John had been shut up in prison. The Scribes and
   Pharisees had persecuted the disciples of Christ. They resorted to
   prayer and we read that "when they had prayed, the place was shaken
   where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the
   Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness. And the
   multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul."
   Yes, all the persecutions of the separate members should be recorded in
   prayer before God, and if the whole Church, itself, should fall into
   disrepute through misrepresentation, or through the natural hostility
   of all men to the Church of God, then should it resort to its Great
   Friend for its defense!

   Persecuting times are hence often very good for the Church because they
   compel her to pray. When the devil, like the wild boar out of the woods
   would break up the vineyard, the vines seem to flourish the more
   because they are watered with the dews of Heaven in answer to prayer.
   Let the stakes smoke at Smithfield and the saints of God go up to
   Heaven in chariots of fire--and then the Word of God multiplies
   exceedingly and the death of the martyrs brings down the blessing to
   themselves and the nation in which they dwell!

   Anything that would make us pray would be a blessing--and if ever we
   should come to times of persecution again, we must fly to the shadow of
   the Eternal and, keeping close together in simple, intense prayer--we
   shall find a shelter from the blast.

   Still keeping to the Acts of the Apostles, in the 12th Chapter you find
   the Prayer Meeting made a means of individual deliverance. You know the
   story well. Peter was in prison and Herod promised himself the great
   pleasure of putting him to death. He was sleeping one night, chained
   between two soldiers--and the keepers of the door kept the prison. But
   prayer was made without ceasing of the Church unto God for him. The
   walls of the prison were very thick, but prayer was made without
   ceasing. The soldiers were very watchful--there were 16 of them,
   appointed to watch Peter by turns--four at a time--and he was chained
   by both hands to two of them. Yet prayer was made without ceasing of
   the Church for him--and prayer laughs altogether at stone walls,
   handcuffs, iron bars and gates of brass! And so, in the middle of the
   night an angel smote Peter upon the side and raised him up--and his
   chains fell off! He put his garments about him--every door opened as he
   advanced--and Peter found himself in the street, and wondered whether
   he was awake, or whether it was a vision. And when he got to the house
   where they were at prayer, they were all equally surprised and thought
   it must be Peter's spirit--that it could never be Peter, himself! Yet
   there he was, in very flesh and blood, released from his prison in
   answer to their prayers! And so in the Prayer Meeting, the Church of
   God may plead for individuals. It may not be God's will, there may be
   no necessity for it, that every one of God's people should bebrought
   out of prison, or raised up from sickness, or saved from need--but if
   it is the Master's will and is a right thing, He will grant it! And,
   so, when we come together we may unite in particular and personal
   supplications! I do not doubt that many a life has been spared in
   answer to united prayer, that many a soul that has been, as it were,
   spirit-burdened, has obtained gracious liberty through the prayers of
   the Brothers and Sisters. It were well if we often put up our prayers
   for one another, remembering those who are in bonds as being bound with
   them. Observe here, then, another valuable use of the Christian Prayer
   Meeting!

   Further on, in the next Chapter, we find a Prayer Meeting suggesting
   missionary operations. While the servants of God were met together--see
   the second verse of the 13th Chapter--fasting and in prayer, the Holy
   Spirit said, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I
   have called them," and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their
   hands on them, they sent them away.

   We sit down and we begin to figure away the expense of such-and-such a
   form of Christian service--and we think that would be a good plan. And
   the other, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth--all pieces of human
   machinery. But I think if we were more often on our knees about God's
   work, we should more often do right--and the right methods and the
   right men, and the right plans would come to us! Christ is the Head of
   the Church--and who thinks so much about the Church as the Head of the
   Church? And while we wait upon Him, I do not doubt but what fresh plans
   and fresh schemes will be marked out, and that different kinds of men
   will be called to the work as distinctly as if angels had touched their
   lips with a live coal from off the burning altar, and who may be
   "separated" to teach the Word, where, perhaps, it has never reached
   before! England needs many who shall shake her and waken her out of her
   sleep. She needs a new race of Whitfields and of Wesleys--of men who
   are before their age only because they are more suited to its culture!
   She needs some Boanerges who shall thunder out the Word of God, some
   men who shall be like lightning in carrying out their holy mission! She
   needs men who will preach the Truth of God and tell it to her poor men,
   yes, and to her rich men, too! And if ever we are to get these, it must
   be in answer to prayer! Oh, that we would but pray for such men and,
   having got them, pray that God would make them full of Himself, for
   they cannot run over with blessings to others until they are,
   themselves, full of blessing! We would understand what the Prayer
   Meeting is, if we did this. I look forward to tomorrow for a blessing
   of this kind. There may be sitting here, now, some young man to whom
   China may be under obligation, or of whom India shall be glad. I do not
   know who it may be, but there may be one here who shall yet bring up
   diamonds from the very depths, and who shall be inspired to do so in
   answer to our prayers!

   Once more, I will remind you of a Prayer Meeting which, perhaps, you
   have forgotten, but which is recorded in the 16th Chapter of the Acts.
   What was the first Christian service that was held in Europe? Do you
   know? Why, it was a Prayer Meeting! The very first service was not an
   Episcopal ordination, nor even the preaching of a sermon, for Paul went
   to the place where prayer was known to be made by the riverside--and
   there he met with Lydia and preached to her--and her heart was so
   opened that she receive the Truth of God! So, then, a Prayer Meeting
   became in Europe the first foothold of the Gospel! Europeans, you ought
   never to forget, disown, or think lightly of Prayer Meetings. How you
   ought to value them! Very often, I do not doubt, in a Christian
   enterprise, the first foothold that a cause gets is the Prayer Meeting.
   You, Brothers and Sisters, some of you live in some of the dark parts
   of this city, and you would like to see a cause for Christ there. Well,
   begin with a Prayer Meeting just as Paul did! Or you live in a small
   village, perhaps, where there is no church with whom you can worship.
   Well then, hold a Prayer Meeting! This costs you nothing! This will
   enrich you! This will serve for a beginning, and although you may not
   be content with that as the only service on the Sabbath after some
   little time, yet begin with it! This then, is the missionary's
   lever--he begins with the Prayer Meeting.

   Thus have I, as briefly as I could, gone through the early history of
   Prayer Meetings and shown you the extreme value of such to the Church
   of God. And now, secondly, and very briefly, indeed--

   II. WHAT ARE THE USES OF THE PRAYER MEETING?

   The Prayer Meeting is useful to us in itself, and also very useful from
   the answer which its gets, and brings to us from God.

   It is a very useful thing for Christians to pray with each other, even
   apart from the answer God has made our piety to be a thing which shall
   be personal, but yet He looks for family piety. Happy is the household
   where the altar burns day and night with the sweet perfume of family
   worship! He also gives us more extended views and makes us feel that
   all the saints are our Brothers and Sisters and that, therefore, our
   meetings as Christian families, and as Christian Churches inthe Prayer
   Meeting, become the exponents and natural outgrowth of social
   godliness. We sing together and pray together--and thus our Christian
   brotherhood is manifested to the world--and is the more enjoyed by
   ourselves.

   The Prayer Meeting serves this purposes and sometimes it also generates
   devotion. Some of the Brothers and Sisters may be very dull and heavy,
   but others who are at that time in a lively state of mind may stimulate
   and excite them. I must confess very often to deriving much fire from
   some of our Brothers and Sisters who pray here on Monday evenings, when
   God gives them Grace to really pray. When you have been busy all day,
   and are not able to shake off the cares of business, you get warmed up
   by getting near to each other in your prayers. And, more than that, the
   united fires being placed together on the hearth, the coals are made to
   burn with greater power. There is a kind of Divine excitement that
   comes upon us, sometimes, at the Prayer Meeting. I recollect in one of
   our meetings for fasting and prayer, the intense excitement there was,
   not fleshly, but deeply spiritual. How we felt ourselves bowed down at
   one time, and then lifted up again at another! I have sometimes sat
   side by side with a Brother who has said, "Can you bear this much
   longer? I feel it is too much for my physical frame." Oh, the calm
   delight which springs from close communion with the invisible God! Such
   days as I have sometimes had have laid me prostrate all the next day
   from very joy, from very excess of delight! Oh, this is good for us!
   This is good for you! Even though the outward man decays, yet shall not
   the inward man, but be renewed from day to day! Oh, it is a grand thing
   thus to be made fit again, with joints all oiled, and muscles all
   braced, and nerves all strung for the battle of life! United prayer,
   then, serves this purpose, and therefore is it valuable.

   But, again, united prayer is useful inasmuch as God has promised
   extraordinary and peculiar blessings in connection with it, "Wherever
   two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst
   of them." "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that
   they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father who is in
   Heaven." God asks agreement and once the saints agree, He pledges
   Himself that the prayer of His agreeing ones shall be answered! Why,
   see what accumulated force there is in prayer, when one after another
   pours out his vehement desires--when many seem to be tugging at the
   rope, when many seem to be knocking at Mercy's gate--when the mighty
   cries of many burning hearts come up to Heaven! When, my Beloved, you
   go and shake the very gates thereof with the powerful battering-ram of
   a holy vehemence and a sacred importunity, then is it that the Kingdom
   of Heaven suffers violence! When first one, and then another, and yet
   another, throws his whole soul into the prayer, the Kingdom of Heaven
   is conquered and the victory becomes great, indeed!

   As I was sitting a little while and thinking over this text, I thought
   of the accumulated love of God which there is in a Prayer Meeting
   because God loves every one of His children. Very well, then, there is
   so much love for one, and here is another, and there is so much love
   for him, and then, if God's love to one of His people is a reason for
   answering his requests--if here are 10 present, there is 10 times the
   reason--and if there are a thousand such, then surely there must be a
   thousand-fold force of love to move our Heavenly Father to grant the
   accumulated desires of the assembly!

   The Prayer Meeting is an institution which ought to be very precious to
   us and to be cherished very much by us as a Church, for to it we owe
   everything. When our comparatively little Chapel was all but empty, was
   it not a well-known fact that the Prayer Meeting was always full? And
   when the Church increased, and the place was scarcely large enough, it
   was the Prayer Meeting that did it all! When we went to Exeter Hall, we
   were a praying people, indeed. And when we entered on the larger
   speculation, as it seemed, of the Surrey Music-Hall, what cries and
   tears went up to Heaven for our success! And so it has been ever since.
   It is in the spirit of prayer that our strength lies! And if we lose
   this, the locks will be shorn from Samson and the Church of God will
   become weak as water. And though, we, as Samson did, go and try to
   shake ourselves as at other times, we shall hear the cry, "The
   Philistines are upon you," and our eyes will be put out, and our glory
   will depart unless we continue mighty and earnest in prayer. But now,
   once again, let us ask--

   III. WHAT ARE THE HINDRANCES TO THE PRAYER MEETING?

   Now listen, for perhaps some of you will hear something about
   yourselves. What are the hindrances to the Prayer Meeting? There are
   some hindrances before the people come. Unholines hinders prayer. A man
   cannot walk contrary to God and then expect to have his prayers heard.
   "If you abide in My commandments, you shall abide in My love." There is
   a promise made to those keeping the commands. Such shall have power
   with God! But, on the other hand, inconsistent Christians shall not be
   answered.

   Discord always spoils prayer. When Believers do not agree and are
   picking holes in each other's coats, they do not really love one
   another--and then their prayers cannot succeed. Discord spoils prayer,
   and so also does hypocrisy, forhypocrites will creep in--you cannot
   help it--and the more a Church flourishes, the more, I believe, do
   hypocrites get in, just as you see many a noxious creeping thing come
   and get into a garden after a shower of rain. The very things that make
   glad the flowers bring out these noxious things--and so hypocrites get
   in and steal much of the Church's sap away and help spoil the Prayer
   Meeting. Now, which among you does this belong to? I am not reflecting
   upon any person in particular, but God knows why some of you do not
   ever come to the Prayer Meeting. Some of you, I know, have business
   that really prevents your coming, and others have service for Him that
   keeps them away, but surely some of our friends who have no other
   imperative engagement or duty do constantly keep away from the Prayer
   Meeting. I only wish that their conscience were even half-awake, for I
   am sure it would make them smart for neglecting this duty. I would that
   they would feel ashamed that they have missed this very great
   privilege, for had they come with us, they might have drawn near to God
   and been healed of their pretences.

   But there are some things which hinder the Prayer Meeting when we are
   at it. One is long prayers. It is dreadful to hear a Brother pray us
   into a good frame, and then, by his long prayer, pray us out of it
   again! You remember what John Macdonald once said, "When I am in a bad
   frame I always pray short, because my prayer will not be of any use,
   and when I am in a good frame I pray short, because if other people are
   in a good frame, too, I might, if I kept on longer, pray them into a
   bad frame." Long prayers, then, spoil Prayer Meetings, for long prayers
   and true devotion in our public assemblies seem pretty much to be
   divorced from one another! And Prayer Meetings are also hindered when
   those who get up to pray do not pray, but preach a little sermon, and
   tell the Lord all about themselves, though He knows them better than
   they do, instead of asking at once for what they need. Prayer Meetings
   are often hindered by a lack of directness and by beating about the
   bush. I admired a prayer I heard last Monday night in which a Brother
   said, "Lord, the orphanage needs £3,000--be pleased to send it." That
   was a straightforward application. Another Brother would have said,
   "Lord, we have great difficulties in our work. Do You be pleased to
   help us," but this Brother just stated the case and I think he believed
   that God would hear him. Another way to never grow weary in prayer is
   to do as a good Scotsman said he did. He said, "I never go to God
   unless I have business to do with Him, unless there is something I want
   to praise Him for, to confess, or to seek at His hands." We must come
   not merely with well-rounded and polished periods, but really to pray,
   and really to praise, and really to confess and seek cleansing! And if
   we do this, the Prayer Meeting shall not disappoint us.

   Prayer Meetings are sometimes hindered by a want of real earnestness i
   n those who pray, and in those who pray in silence. Ah, Brothers and
   Sisters, one warm, hearty prayer is worth a score of those packed in
   ice! I fear that much of our prayer is lost because we do not
   sufficiently throw our hearts into it. It is possible for us to attend
   the meeting and all the while be thinking of the home, the infant in
   the cradle, or the shop, the field, the farm, the factory, the
   counting-house, and I know not what besides! Is it any wonder, then,
   that prayer stops? The Brother who prays may be burning with earnest
   desire, but his prayer lags because we are not backing it with silent
   fervor and passionate longing for God's blessing. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, we have often spoiled our Prayer Meetings thus! We have each,
   I fear, in our turn done something towards it--let us pray that we may
   never again so transgress.

   But the Prayer Meeting may also be spoiled after we have been to it.
   "How?" you ask. Why, by our asking a blessing and then not expecting to
   receive it! God has promised that He will do to us according to our
   faith, but if our faith is nothing, then the answer will also be
   nothing. Inconsistency, too, in not practically carrying out your
   desires will also spoil the Prayer Meeting. If you ask God to convert
   souls, but you will not do anything for those souls. If you ask God to
   save your children, but you will not talk to them about their
   salvation. If you ask God to save your neighbors, and you do not
   distribute tracts among them, nor do anything else for them, are you
   not altogether a hypocrite? You pray for what you do not put out your
   hand to get! You pray for fruit, but you will not put out your hand to
   pluck it, and all this spoils the Prayer Meeting. Earnest prayer,
   however, is always to be followed up by persevering efforts--and then
   the result will be great, indeed! But for a moment will I occupy your
   time upon the next point, and then we have done. It is this--

   IV. WHAT SHOULD BE THE GREAT OBJECTIVE OF THE PRAYER MEETING--AND THAT
   FOR WHICH

   WE SHOULD SEEK THE ANSWER?

   First, it must be the glory of Godor else the petition is not
   sufficiently put up. How much of the Lord's Prayer consists in prayers
   for God, rather than for ourselves? "Hallowed be Your name: Your
   Kingdom come: Your will be done, asin Heaven, so on earth." And then
   comes, "Give us this day our daily bread." Do we not often begin by
   asking for the bread, and leave the glory of God to be put into a
   corner? Pray that King Jesus may have His own! Pray that the royal
   crown may be set upon that dear head that once was girt with thorns!
   Pray that the thrones of the heathen may totter from their pedestals,
   and that Jesus may be acknowledged King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
   This is to be the grand objective of our prayer! You recollect how
   David put it, "Let the whole earth be filled with His Glory. The
   prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended." For the coming of
   Christ in power, for the extension of His Kingdom, for the downfall of
   error, for the end of the times of darkness, for the ingathering of the
   Jews and the Gentiles--for all these things let us pray in order that
   God may be glorified, and on that account alone!

   And then, in subservience to that, let us pray for a blessing on the
   Church. We ought to exercise a little of our love for one another in
   praying for our fellow members. Pray for the minister, for he needs it
   most. His necessities in that direction are the greatest and,
   therefore, let him always be remembered. Pray for the Church officers.
   Pray for the workers in all organizations. Pray for the sufferers. Pray
   for the strong, for the weak, for the rich, for the poor, for the
   trembling, for the sick, for the backsliding, for the sinful. Yes, for
   every part of the one great body of Jesus let our supplications
   perpetually ascend. Let our prayers be continual, that the holy oil of
   which we read may run down from the head even to the skirts of the
   garment!

   Then we should also pray for the conversion of the ungodly. Oh, this
   ought to be like a burden on our hearts! This ought to be prayed out of
   the lowest depths of a soul that is all aglow with sympathy for them.
   They are dying! They are dying! They are dying without hope! I stood
   yesterday at the grave's brink at the funeral of one of our Brothers,
   an Elder of the Church. The place that knew him once, will know him no
   more, and someone else now occupies the seat where he formerly sat. It
   was a great joy to know that he had rested on the Rock so long and that
   he had now entered into the rest which Jesus had promised him. But oh,
   to stand by those who die without hope is grim work--this is to sorrow
   without alleviation, to mourn without any sweet reflection to wipe away
   the tears! Oh, my Hearers, will you die in your sins? Will you live in
   your sins, for if you live in them, you will die in them! My Hearers,
   will you die without a Savior? Will you live without a Savior? For if
   you live without Him, you will assuredly die without Him! It is of no
   use my preaching to the people, my dear Christian Brothers and Sisters,
   unless you pray for them! It is of no use holding special services for
   the quickening of the spiritually dead unless the Holy Spirit is
   brought into the field by our prayers! It may be that you who pray have
   more to do with the blessed results than we who preach! I think I have
   told you of the old monkish story of the monk who had been very
   successful in his preaching, but a message came from Heaven to him that
   it would not have been so if it had not been for the prayers of an old
   deaf brother monk who sat upon the pulpit stairs and pleaded with God
   for the conversion of the hearers. It may be so. We may appear to the
   eyes of men to have the credit of success, but all the while the real
   honor may belong to someone else! And I do certainly, myself, always
   ascribe the conversions worked in this house to the prayers of God's
   people. Let it always be so ascribed and let God have the whole Glory
   of it! But do pray for conversions. Never give up on your unconverted
   wife, Husband! Never cease to pray for your unconverted children. Never
   let the devil tempt you to be dumb concerning your ungodly neighbors,
   but day and night, in the house and by the way, lift up your hearts to
   God in real prayer, and say to Him, "Oh, that Ishmael might live before
   You!" He has given us His pledge that He will answer--believe it and
   you shall see it, and you shall have the joy of it while His shall be
   the Glory! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS4:8-33.

   Peter and John were summoned before the priests to give an account for
   having healed the lame man, and for having preached in the name of
   Jesus of Nazareth. In the eighth verse we read--

   Verses 8-12. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them,
   You rulers of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day are
   examined for the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he
   is made whole, be it known unto you all, and to all the people of
   Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you
   crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him does this man
   stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at naught
   of you builders, which is become the head of the corner Neither is
   there salvation in any other, for there is none other nameunder Heaven
   given among men whereby we must be saved. Nothing can exceed the
   directness, the comprehensiveness and the boldness of this statement!
   He not only declares the name of Christ to be the wonder-working name,
   but he charges them with His murder, reasserts the Resurrection--no,
   further--he cuts at the root of all their ceremonial righteousness and
   declares that they must be saved by this hated and despised name, or
   else perish forever! Under all circumstances, let the servant of God
   behave himself boldly! Let him remember that this is the hour he ought
   always to speak, and that when the honor of his Master and the welfare
   of souls are concerned, it is not for him to withhold, but to speak out
   the Truth of God!

   13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
   that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. And they took
   notice of them, that they had been with Jesus. Where else could such
   holy courage have been learned? They spoke, in their measure, just as
   the great Master did, of whom it is written, "He spoke as One having
   authority, and not as the Scribes." They did not speak with the timid,
   hesitating manner of a preacher who seems to hold the balance of
   probabilities between the right and the wrong, the false and the true,
   but with the demonstration of a hearty conviction of the truth of the
   principles which they uttered. So Christ spoke, and, having learned of
   Him, so spoke His disciples!

   14. And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they
   could say nothing against it.Converts shut the mouths of adversaries.
   The good done by the Gospel will always be a dumb-foundering argument
   to the ungodly.

   16-20. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
   they conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do to these men?
   For that, indeed, a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest
   to all them that dwellin Jerusalem: and we cannot deny it But that it
   spreads no further among thepeople, let us severely threaten them, that
   they speak, henceforth, to no man in this name. And they called them
   and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
   But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in
   the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge you. For
   we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. Like the
   vessel full of new wine, which must have vent or burst, so is the man
   who is filled with the knowledge of Jesus! He must speak. He must--

   "Tell to others round, What a dear Savior he has found."

   It is no matter of choice with him, for, as Paul says, "Woe is unto me
   if I preach not the Gospel." As the old Prophet has it, "The word of
   the Lord was as fire in my bones," and if it is the true Word of God,
   it will soon burn its way out!

   21-22. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
   finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people: for
   all men glorified God for that which was done. For the man was above
   forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed. Therefore
   it was the more remarkable--forty years lame and yet healed! But how
   great is the Grace displayed in the salvation of an aged sinner--forty
   years dead in trespasses and in sins--fifty, sixty, seventy, or even 80
   years, a faithful servant of the black tyrant and yet made to follow
   the new and better Master! What a triumph of Grace is that which
   snatches the sere brand out of the burning when it is so fitted for the
   fire!

   23. And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all
   that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.You can always
   tell a man by his company. Had these people been ungodly, they would
   have done as the ungodly do when they come out of prison--they would
   have gone off to their old pot-companions. But they are Believers, and
   so they go to their own company.

   24-28. And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
   one accord, and said, Lord, You are God, which have made Heaven and
   earth, and the sea, and all that is in them. Who by the mouth of Your
   servant, David, have said, Why did the heathen rage and the people
   imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers
   were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ For of
   a truth against Your holy Child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both
   Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel,
   were gathered together For to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel
   determined before, to be done. How strangely this Doctrine of
   Predestination comes in just there! They are singing of the wickedness
   of men, and the triumph which God gets over it--and so this is the very
   sum and substance of the song--that when wicked men think that God's
   decrees will be forever put away by the destruction of His Son, they
   themselves are then actually doing what God had "determined before to
   be done." The wildest discord makes harmony in the ear of God! Man may
   be in rebellion against the Most High, but he is still abjectlythe
   slave of God's predestination! And let man sin with his free will, even
   to the most extreme length of folly, yet even then God has a bit in his
   mouth and a bridle upon his jaws, and knows how to rule and govern him
   according to His own good pleasure! The ferocity of kings and priests
   does but fulfill the counsel of God!

   29-33. And now, Lord, behold their threats and grant unto Your servants
   that with all boldness they may speak Your Word, by stretching forth
   Your hand to heal: and that signs and wonders may be done by the name
   of the holy Child Jesus. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken
   where they were assembled together: and they were all filled with the
   Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness. And the
   multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul:
   neither saidany of them that any of the things which hepossessed was
   his own, but they had all things common. And with great power gave the
   Apostles witness of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great Grace
   was upon them all.

A Call to the Depressed

   (No. 3422)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Shakeyourself from the dust, arise and sit down, O Jerusalem: loosen
   yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion."
   Isaiah 52:2.

   I SHALL not attempt at this time to decipher the history of the
   prophecy with which these words are associated. To the Hebrew nation
   they were big with counsel, bright with hope. Apart, however, from the
   connection in which it stands, this verse supplies a pointed practical
   address of sterling value not to be limited by any private
   interpretation. Such a charge was well fitted for Israel of old. Such
   counsel would be suitable to any Church in a low condition. Such advice
   is equally adapted to any Christian who has fallen into a low state,
   who is groveling in the dust or among the ashes of Sodom. He is told to
   rise from the ground and sit down upon a throne, for Christ has made
   him a king and a priest. He is admonished to unbind all the cords that
   are upon him, that he may be free and happy in the Lord. To those of
   you, then, who have sunk into this distressing plight, my text contains
   a vigorous appeal! Let me try to interpret it. First of all, I notice
   the obvious fact--

   I. SOME OF GOD'S TRUE PEOPLE ARE IN A VERY SAD CONDITION.

   This is an important consideration to us just now. If just on the eve
   of battle a commander should discover that an epidemic has broken out
   among his troops, he will be extremely anxious that any available
   remedy shall be tried, for if the soldiers are sick, how can they be
   expected to behave well on the morrow? So it will sometimes happen that
   when we mean to serve our Master most, we are impeded in Church action
   by the prevalence of some spiritual disease among the members of the
   Church. Perhaps I may be the means, tonight, of finding out the sick
   ones, and indicating their symptoms, and--who can tell--perhaps this
   very night, before you come to the Table, the blessed remedy may be
   applied, and at the Table, while you are feasting with Christ, your
   souls may become perfectly restored!

   Sometimes the children of God fall into a grievous state as to their
   faith and their assurance of their own interest in Christ. They doubt
   whether they are Christians at all, whether their experience is
   genuine, whether they ever did really repent with a truly broken heart,
   whether they have received the precious faith--the faith of God's
   elect. At such times they question all their graces and they are not
   able to get a satisfactory answer from anyone. At the same time these
   people of God may be so walking in outward consistency that everybody
   else thinks well of them. No one has any suspicion of them, but they
   grievously suspect themselves and are tormented with the fear that they
   have a name to live, and are dead. I have known at such times that
   there will come at the back of all this some terrible doubts about the
   substantial Truths of our faith. "What?" You say, "doubts about the
   Godhead--doubts about the Savior--doubts about the world to come?" Yes,
   yes, and to the true people of God! They will hate these doubts and, in
   their hearts they will still believe all the great fundamental and
   cardinal Truths--but yet will they be sore put to it and be frequently
   distressed. Thoughtful minds, and men of reading will have
   philosophical doubts buzzing about them like mosquitoes on a summer's
   day. Others who are ignorant of philosophy and, perhaps, it is well
   that they are, will be troubled with doubts of a rougher, coarser
   quality. Although they will not permit them so to dwell in their hearts
   so that they actually become unbelievers--yet they will be sorely
   distressed with questions which they cannot answer, with enigmas which
   they know not how to solve, and with strange intertwistings of
   difficulty which they know not how to untie. Perhaps, too, at such a
   time as this, there will be over all and worse than all, a state of
   dreadful indifference creeping over them. They want to feel, but cannot
   feel. They would gladly wring tears of blood out of their eyes, but not
   even an ordinary tear will drop. They want to be cut to pieces! They
   would welcome the most poignant sorrow, but they can only say--

   "If anything is felt, 'tis only pain, To feel I cannot feel."

   In such cases, true Believers are sure to resort to the extraordinary
   use of the means of Grace. I mean they will add to their ordinary use,
   something more. Have you never been in such a state that the Bible has
   become uninteresting, or the only passages of Scripture that seemed to
   strike you were dreadful threats concerning your Own coming doom, as
   you thought--not a word of comfort, not a syllable that makes glad your
   spirit? You have gone to prayer and the heavens have seemed to be
   brass! And worse still, your own heart seemed to be brass, too, and you
   could not stir it up to anything like an intensity of desire. You did
   not wonder that you got no answer. You would have wondered if such a
   prayer as yours could be heard at all! Ah, and then you have gone up to
   the assembly of God's people where at other times your heart has danced
   within you with holy joy! The minister was not changed. Perhaps at
   first you thought he was, but on more attentive bearing, you noticed
   that there was the same Truths of God and spoken in the same honest
   fashion, but you could not hear it as you once did. Clouds without rain
   and wells without water--all the ordinances seemed to be to you. And
   all the while, though you felt that you could not live like this, and
   said--

   "Dear Lord, and shall I always live, At this poor dying rate?"yet
   somehow or other you could not get out of it. You felt like one
   manacled, as though a nightmare were upon you. You were distressed. You
   could not stir to break the spell! Your spirit cried out as best it
   could, "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death?" But the worst of it was that you did not feel that you
   were wretched enough, and you did not seem to cry enough! You were
   afraid you would sink into a terrible lethargy which would be the
   forerunner to a spiritual death altogether.

   Well, my dear Friends, I should not wonder but you brought this very
   much upon yourselves. If you are in this state tonight, I would exhort
   you to question whether this is not the result of what you have often
   been warned of. Perhaps you slackened prayer. Perhaps in your happier
   days you grieved the Holy Spirit just when you were most joyful and
   happy in His love. It may be that you grew worldly, or, perhaps, a long
   succession of little things, none of which you noticed at the time,
   have contributed to swell the stream of your present distress. At any
   rate, whatever may be the cause of this state, I grieve that you are in
   it--grieve for my own sake, for your sake, for the sake of this
   Church--and for the sake of the world around you, for, my Brothers and
   Sisters, your testimony is, to a great extent, silenced and your
   strength to bear it weakened. That face of yours, once so happy, was a
   living advertisement of the Gospel! Your cheerful temperament under
   trial was an invitation to sinners to come and find a like joy. But now
   you are distressed and you go mourning without the light of the sun.
   What can you do while you abide in such a state as that? You are like
   the bruised reed out of which no music can come, or like the smoking
   flax that yields no light, but only a dolorous and nauseous smoke. I am
   grieved that it should be so, because were you now to attempt a verbal
   testimony for Christ, it would be feeble and could not produce any
   great result. I remember when I began to teach in the Sunday school. I
   was very young in Grace then, having said to the class of boys whom I
   was teaching that Jesus Christ saved all those who believed in Him. One
   of the boys asked me the question, "Teacher, do you believe in Him?" I
   replied, "Yes, I hope I do." And he enquired again, "But are you not
   sure?" I had to look to myself to know what answer I should give. The
   lad was not content with my repeating, "I hope so." He would have it,
   "If you have believed in Christ, you are saved." And I felt at that
   time that I could not teach until I could say, "I know that it is so."
   I must be able to speak of what I had tasted and handled of the good
   Word of Life! So, Brothers, you will find that you only perplex those
   whom you gladly would persuade if, by your doubts, you provoke them to
   say, "How can you expect us to believe at our mouth what you hesitate
   to seal with the witness of your own heart?" Unless the joy of the Lord
   is your strength, your soul will breathe a heavy atmosphere and your
   utterance will be checked, if it is not chokedby your misgivings! It is
   your confidence in Christ and the peace it brings you, that helps you
   to speak to others as a true witness, because you are an experimental
   witness of the power of true religion. Your verbal testimony, I say, is
   weakened--I fear to a very great extent by the fog and vapor of your
   scruples, the scruples of a conscience that droops and flags. It is sad
   to think that while you are looking to your own soul in doubt whether
   you are saved or not, you have but little energy to spare in caring
   about the souls of others! Indeed, it is your first concern to see that
   you, yourself, are saved. Till that all-important matter is resolved,
   your zeal for your neighbor's welfare is ill-timed. Why busy yourselves
   to keep other men's vineyards, while your own is left to be overgrown
   with weeds? And then, my dear Friends, another melancholy aspect of
   this disability is that all this while you are a detrimentto your
   fellow Christians. It is hard enough to fight with Satan, but it is all
   the harder work for the army to have to carry so many sick folk with
   it, for it involves much more toil. You, whose faith is all but gone,
   are like the baggage of an army--you hinder the rapid march of the
   brave soldiers of the Cross! How you depress others that are around
   you! Once your voice was that of a brave hero and you encouraged the
   troops, but now you pine and cry, and make others hang their harps upon
   the willows and learn the same doleful tune as your own! It is a sad
   thing. I do not condemn you, but I greatly pity you, and I also greatly
   pity the Church of God, and the cause of God, that it loses so much by
   you who ought, in gratitude to Christ, do so much for Him. Alas, that
   the people of God should be sunk into so mournful a condition!

   II. THERE IS A SPECIAL EXPECTATION FOR THEM.

   This is pressed in all earnest. Hear, it, oh, ailing Christian! "Shake
   yourself from the dust, arise and sit down, O Jerusalem: loosen
   yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion."

   Now, my Brother, content not yourself any longer with the state into
   which you have fallen. May the Holy Spirit come to you and prompt you
   to strike. Strive to get out of this condition into one of happiness
   and strength. Let me try to encourage you a little, and may God enable
   you to the utmost.

   Remember, my dear Friend--suppose I am now talking to you, alone. I
   almost wish I could grip your hand and look you close in the
   face--remember from where you have fallen. Think of the peaceful hours
   you once enjoyed. Oh, your stony heart was not always so cold! The Word
   of God was not always so dry! The sanctuary was not always so
   unprofitable! You have wrestled and prevailed--you know you have! You
   have pleaded with God and you have had the desire of your heart. You
   have communed with Christ and your soul has been like the chariots of
   Aminadab! And can you bear to think of this and not cry--

   "Return, OHoly Dove, return, Sweet Messenger of rest!"?

   Can you once have known these things and had the flavor of them in your
   mouth, without hungering and thirsting after them again? Think of them
   and, perhaps, while you are musing upon the past, you may be helped by
   strong desires to return unto the place from which you went out.

   Think of the danger you are in at present. Who are they that are most
   likely to fall into open sin? They are those who walk at a distance
   from Christ. If you live in close communion with Jesus, you shall so
   share of your Shepherd's company that you shall hear the wolf's howl,
   but you shall not be likely to feel his fangs. I believe that when any
   professor falls into a filthy sin, it is not the beginning, but the
   culmination of a process and growth in iniquity! The open sin comes at
   the heels of a long succession of neglected prayers, of neglected
   worship of God in the family, a neglect of all communion with Christ
   and negligence of every good thing. It is the fruit, not the seed of
   the evil, which poisons the air and excites the public contempt.
   Beware, then, O professor!--you who have lost the light of God's
   Countenance--beware! Beware, I pray you, of that ill-condition of soul
   which is the prolific parent of all distempers!

   Remember, too, that there is real cause for apprehension that you never
   were safe. It is just possible that those doubts you feel are no
   insinuations of Satan, but the suggestions of an enlightened
   conscience, or even the whispers of the Holy Spirit! Unless you are,
   indeed, a Christian, in all probability, unless you now turn to God,
   you will become the willing servitor of the Devil. Unless you now, with
   full purpose of heart, seek Christ, perhaps the time has come when you
   will turn aside, like Balaam, for reward, or perish in the gainsaying
   of Korah. In some of those shapes in which wicked men have perished,
   you may despondingly or presumptuously rush on to destruction and
   precipitate your final doom! Beware again, I say, O cold professor--in
   God's name, beware of trifling when you have so much reason to tremble!

   My dear Friend, I would put another thought into your mind which may
   help you. Perhaps you may think it is rather hampering than helping you
   and tends more to depress than to deliver you. Remember how justly you
   might now be left to your own devices. You became carnally secure. You
   sinned away the light of God's Countenance. You grieved His Spirit.
   What if He were now to say, "He is given unto idols, let him alone"?
   What if from this day the Spirit should no more strive with you? What
   if, after all, though you have talked and preached to others, you
   yourself should be a castaway? I do but mention this to awaken you, my
   Brother, if you are insensible. You know how sometimes the surgeon
   fears that a man should sleep himself to death, and he will even drive
   pins into him, or make him walk and drag him about thechamber so as to
   awaken him. I would say anything, however sharp, if I might but wake
   you out of your lethargy! I know you would welcome it and, in due time,
   thank me for the severity of the operation.

   But I shall refrain, for I think there is a better way than this. I
   want you to arise and shake yourself from the dust, my poor desponding
   Friend, because if the worst is the worst and you are no Christian, no
   true Believer, yet, "Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord,
   though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as wool. Though they are
   red like crimson, they shall be white as snow." What if it has been all
   a mistake and you never ought to have made a profession? Remember Jesus
   Christ receives sinners--come to Him now! I always find this the short
   way out of a long dreary road, a quick relief for acute maladies, a
   ready antidote for doubts and fears. The Devil has been arguing with
   Christians for so many years that he understands the case against them
   a great deal better than any of us do, and if we begin to controvert
   with him, we shall soon find that that old hater of man will soon get
   the mastery over us! But if we say, "I give in, Satan--I give in. I am
   a sinner--the chief of sinners--have you anything more to say? I give
   in, but I answer you with this--'The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,
   cleanses us from all sin. I believe in Him and my sins are, therefore,
   washed away!'" This is the high road to perfect comfort! I beg you, my
   dear Brother, to take it at once! Hear the Word of the Spirit, which
   says, "Repent, and do your first works." The very first works were
   repentance and faith, and so even begin again! Away to the Fountain
   filled with blood! Away to the Cross, and give that life-look once
   more! Away to the finished Substitutionary Sacrifice and beneath the
   crimson canopy of the Atonement, hide your guilty head! Oh, if you do
   this, your light shall break forth as the morning, and your glory as
   the noonday! The Lord help you to do this, now, and end the strife!

   Let me also remind any Christian here who is full of doubt and with the
   bands of his neck tight upon him, that the blood has not changed its
   power to cleanse. If it cleansed you 20 years ago, it can cleanse you
   still! Remember, Jesus has not lost His power to save, nor has He
   changed His Character for willingness to save to the uttermost--

   "Jesussits onZion'shill, He receives poor sinners still." Come, then,
   to the unchanging Savior! You who have been treacherous--you whose
   hearts have played the harlot to Christ--come back, for His love to you
   has not waned! "Return unto Me, O backsliding daughter, says the Lord;
   for I am married unto you." The prodigal's heart may change towards his
   Father, but his Father's heart never changes towards him. Return, then,
   for mercy waits you, and not judgment! He is God and not man, else you
   had been consumed! Return tonight, for He will put away your sin like a
   cloud, and your transgressions like a thick cloud. Duly acknowledge
   your wandering. Humble yourself because of your treachery and say, "My
   Father, You shall be the guide of my youth," and you shall be restored
   perfectly, and your former joy shall come back to you!

   Do I hear you say, "But I am not fit to come back to Christ, and have
   joy in Him at once"? Oh, Sir, were you fit at first? No! And you are
   not fit now, but come and welcome! Christ wants nothing from you! Come
   and trust Him and perfect salvation is yours. "Oh, but I cannot bear to
   look Him in the face, for I have lived so long without walking in His
   counsel." So much the more reason that you should not live another hour
   without Him! I charge you, my poor distressed Brother--I charge you, my
   troubled Sister--by the love that Christ has to you, come to Him now!
   Behold, He stands at the door and knocks! If you will open to Him,
   though the house is not furnished, nor the table covered with a
   festival for Him as it should be, yet will He come in and sup with you,
   even with you, and you shall sup with Him tonight! I see no reason why
   the most desponding Christian, here, should not rejoice before he comes
   to the Table of the Lord! I do not know why the most barren among us
   should not be made fruitful! This I do know, that we are not straitened
   in Him, we are not straitened in His willingness to bless, nor in His
   ability to comfort! Oh, believe in Him, Christian! Believe Him. If you
   are not a Christian, cast yourself at His feet. He will not let you
   perish! Lay hold, if it is but of the hem of His garment and do not let
   Him go! Even now shake yourself from the dust and put on your beautiful
   garments.

   III. A GLAD OBLIGATION HENCEFORTH RESTS UPON THEM.

   I must close with this remark. I know there are many of God's people in
   the state I have been describing. I have the pain, sometimes, of trying
   to cheer them. I only hope that what I have said tonight may be blessed
   of God to them. I fully anticipate it. Here, then, is the practical
   point. " When you are converted, strengthen your Brothers and Sisters."

   Look out for those who are in the same state as you have been in--and
   be very tender toward them. As you know their case, and have traversed
   that howling desert, you will be able to direct them. I have described
   your case because Ifear that I have sometimes been on the verge of it
   myself. I have found recovery by a fresh resort to the love of Christ
   and a simple renewal of my trust in Him. I can, therefore, enter into
   your feelings and ask you to try the same remedy. After you have found
   the remedy to be a good one, it is but a small return, and certainly it
   is due from you, to tell others how you have been restored!

   Some of you, Beloved, have never been thus carried into captivity. I
   pray God you never may be. There is no necessity for it, but let me
   entreat you to walk very tenderly with your God. We serve a jealous
   God. He will wink at many an act of insubordination done by His
   enemies, the one-tenth of which, if done by His favorite ones, His
   elect, His darlings--He will hide His face from them at once! "You,
   only, have I known of all the people of the earth, therefore I will
   punish you for your iniquities." Says He not, "As many as I love, I
   rebuke and chasten"? A sinner may go on wantonly unrebuked. He may add
   house to house and field to field, and he may think himself secure--God
   will deal with him in the next world. But the heir of Heaven is under a
   discipline of Divine Love and God will deal with him in this world! And
   among the chastisements of departure from Christ will be the loss of
   comfort, the loss of power to do good and I know not what other
   affliction added thereunto in his soul or in his circumstance. Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, walk carefully, then-- while you have the Light
   of God, walk in the Light! Oh, prize the sweet love of Christ! Never,
   never let it go. Say unto your soul, when Christ is in your heart, "I
   charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of
   the field, that you stir not up nor wake my Love until He pleases."
   Introduce no rival's love, and no worldliness! Fall into no
   inconsistencies, but pray for Grace that with holy jealousy you may
   still dwell in the Light of God and find favor in His eyes.

   And being thus kept near to God, and being strong in the power of His
   might, come and give back the strength to Him from whom you derived it.
   Stand up for Christ! I believe we are never happier than when we have
   plenty to do. Idleness is the mother of vexation. A Christian who does
   but little for Christ, unless he is prevented from doing it by
   suffering, will, as a rule, be a miserable man or woman! You active
   Christians, active in body and nimble in spirit--you joyous Christians
   who walk in the Light of God's Countenance--"work while it is day, for
   the night comes when no man can work." Let us pledge each other tonight
   that we will now seek the good of Zion. Members of this Church, none of
   you be unfaithful to the loyalty which you owe to Christ in this, the
   hour when we seek to press forward as one man in the battle of our
   Master! I would stand side by side with you to take my share--but what
   can one do if he works alone? My Brothers in office will not be
   backward, I know, but what can we do? Keep step with us, my Brothers
   and Sisters, in pleading for souls, in proclaiming the Gospel, in
   seeking to win the many to the knowledge of the Savior--and the Lord
   will bless us, even our own God will bless us! Shaking ourselves from
   the dust, and breaking off the bands of our own sloth, God will come
   with His crown of benediction and place it on His Church's head! And
   when we get that coveted prize, let us hold it fast, that no man take
   it from us. Let us go forward as a Church in indissoluble union and in
   unwearied service, until He shall come whose, "Well done!" shall be our
   best reward!

   The Lord bless you! And at His Table may the King's sweet spikenard
   give forth a delightful perfume to every spiritual heart. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 138; ISAIAH 55:1-11; ROMANS8:28-39.

   Verse 1. I will praise You with my whole heart; before the gods will I
   sing praise unto You. We cannot be too much occupied in the praises of
   God. He rightly deserves all the thanksgivings we can bring to Him. It
   is the great engagement of Heaven. Let us begin the music here. If we
   would be heavenly-minded on earth, we must be filled with the praises
   of God! Notice how David resolves that in praising God it shall be done
   heartily. "I will praise You with my whole heart." If there is ever a
   thing that ought to be done enthusiastically, it is the praising of
   God! I cannot bear to hear God's praises chirped out elegantly by
   polite people--as if they were ashamed of what they were doing. Nor can
   I bear to see a mass of pipes and bellows left by itself to blow the
   praises of God by machinery--instead of men and women praising Him with
   their heart! Oh, how acceptable it must be to God to hear the heart
   speak! As for the tongue and voice, however sweet their sound, there is
   little in it. It is the heart! Soul music is the soul of music. "I will
   praise You with my whole heart." See how bold the Psalmist is about
   this. "Before the gods," he says," will I do it. Before the angels,
   before the kings and great ones that think themselves little gods. I
   will speak to the honor of Jehovah's name. Yes, and in the idol
   temples, where their worshippers will be greatly angry about it. I will
   praise You with my whole heart. Before the gods will I present praise
   unto You."

   2. I will worship toward Your holy Temple. That was God's way of
   worship. In the old times there was the shrine of God--there was the
   one altar which world render praise acceptable. David takes care to
   render praise to God in God's way. And that is a great principle in
   worship--to avoid will-worship and to endeavor to present sacrifices
   such as God prescribes. "I will worship toward the holy Temple." What
   blessed reasons are here given for praising. "I will praise You for
   Your loving kindness." Is not that the grandest word in any
   language--loving kindness? It is a compound of perfect sweets to make
   up yet more perfect sweetness--kindness and love mixed together. A
   marvelous blend! Loving kindness gave the promise, but truth takes care
   to see it fulfilled. "So will I praise Your name."

   2. Andpraise Your name for Your loving kindness and for Your truth, for
   You have magnified Your Word. That is, "Your Word of promise--Your
   Gospel which You have applied with power to my soul. You have made it
   to seem lustrous beyond anything else I have ever seen of You, O my
   God! Therefore will I magnify You, because You have magnified Your
   Word."

   2, 3. Above all Your name. In the day when I cried, You answered me,
   and strengthened me with strength in my soul Ah, this is what ties a
   man to praise. Answered prayer is sure to lead us to adoring gratitude.
   Notice that he says that God answered him not by taking away his
   trouble, but by strengthening him! With strength in his soul. You see
   it does not matter whether He takes away the load, or strengthens the
   back to bear it. And that is often the method by which He answers His
   servants' cries. Not strength of body--perhaps he would have liked
   that--but strength of soul. And oh, when the soul in strong, bodily
   weakness is but a very small drawback. No, the weakness of the body may
   sometimes tend to illustrate the more the greatness of the power of
   God. Let us read that verse again, for some of us can set our seal to
   it. "In the day when I cried, You answered me, and strengthened me with
   strength in my soul."

   4, 5. All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O LORD, when they
   hear the words of Your mouth. Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the
   LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. David was a king, and kings
   would learn from him. You and I are not kings, but we may exercise a
   very beneficial influence in our own circle of acquaintances if we make
   bold to praise God when others can hear us. Let us speak well of His
   name. Wherever we go, let us have a good word for our Master. When
   others want to know what sort of God we serve, may they gather it from
   our holy joy and exultant confidence at all times!

   6. Though the LORD is high, yet has He respect unto the lowly; but the
   proud He knows afar off A glance of them is quite enough for Him. He
   has no wish to know any more about them, He so hates them! Nothing can
   separate God from a soul so much as pride. It is that which causes the
   rejection of the Gospel. Men will not have the humbling Gospel--the
   sinners' Gospel. They are too fine, too good, too lofty--and so they do
   not want God, neither does His soul desire them. "For the proud He
   knows afar off."

   7. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me. He was a
   king but he had his trouble. A throne is not a place wherein we can
   shelter ourselves from trial. "Though I walk in the midst of
   trouble"--like a man that is to rush through a fire--"yet I shall be
   safe," he says, "for You will revive me--give me new life. When it
   seems as if my life would be destroyed, You will quicken me again."

   7, 8. You shall stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my
   enemies, and Your right hand shall save me. The LORD will perfect that
   which concerns me: Your mercy, O LORD, endures forever: forsake not the
   works of Your own hands. Note the confident spirit that runs through
   all this. There is a childlike trust in God and there is a gladsome
   praise of God for what has been already received at his hands. Oh for
   more of this spirit--the spirit that makes music to the Lord for the
   past and trusts Him for the present and the future. Some more blessed
   words of comfort from--

   ISAIAH 55:1-11.

   Verse 1. Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that
   has no money; come you, buy, and eat: yes, come buy wine and milk
   without money and without price. Remark the wonderful condescension of
   God, that though the gifts of His Grace are so precious that all the
   world could not buy them, yet He condescends to ask His creature to
   have those gifts. He stands, as it were, like One who has goods to
   sell, and He cries, "Ho! Such-and-such a passerby, turnhere: give ear
   in this way. Ho! Everyone that thirsts." If, then, there is any soul
   that wants God, O Soul, God desires you infinitely more than you desire
   Him! And He invites you to come to Him. Do not delay!

   2. Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? And your labor
   for that which satisfies not?Seeking happiness in a thousand ways with
   much toil and trouble, but with bitter disappointment.

   2. Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat you that which is good, and let
   your soul delight itself in fatness. God invites His creature to listen
   to Him. "Do," He says "but lend Me your ear a little. Do but hearken
   diligently to what I have to tell you." Oh, should not God's message of
   love command the attention of all mankind?

   3. Incline your ear and come unto Me! Hear, and your soul shall
   live.Salvation does not come to men through the eye, but through the
   ear. Not what you see in the finery of the priest or the altar. That
   can do you no good. But listen to the Gospel. It is by ear-gate that
   God's mercy comes triumphant into the soul of man. "Incline your ear
   and come unto Me. Hear and your soul shad live."

   3. And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David. Here God will strike hands with the sinner and enter
   into a compact with him--a Covenant of Mercy and of Grace through Jesus
   Christ, the Savior!

   4. Behold I have given Him for a witness to the people. To bear witness
   to men of what God is.

   4. A leader and commander to the people.For Christ loves the people and
   He leads them rightly. He will lead them to Glory!

   5. Behold, You shall calla nation that You knnownot, andnations that
   knownot You shallrun unto You because of the LORD, Your God, and for
   the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You. The promise is to
   Christ! Today are these words fulfilled in our ears, for in calling
   these British Isles to know Christ, God has given to the Lord Jesus a
   people that knew Him not. What did our forefathers know of Jesus when
   He was here below? And yet in this land He has multitudes of hearts
   that love His name! Oh, that God would give this whole house full of
   souls to Christ tonight! What a box it would make full ofjewels! Oh,
   that the gracious Father would bestow it on His Son!

   6-11. Seek you the LORD while He may be found, call you upon Him while
   He is near Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy upon
   him: and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts are
   not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the LORD. For as
   the heavens are higher than the earth, so the rain comes down, and the
   snow from Heaven, and returns not there, but waters the earth, and
   makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and
   bread to the eater So shall My Word be that goes forth out of My
   mouth--it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that
   which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
   Therefore, we are not at all afraid about the success of the preaching
   of the Gospel. Some will be saved tonight wherever Jesus Christ is
   preached! My dear unsaved Hearer, will it be you? I pray it may be. May
   the Lord grant that this may be the last night of your unregeneracy,
   and be your spiritual birth night! Some willbe saved! Will yoube of the
   number?

   ROMANS8:28-39.

   Verses 28-30. And we know that all things work together for good to
   them that love God, to them who are the called according to His
   purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born
   among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also
   called: and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He
   justified, them He also glorified. No breaks between the links of this
   chain! Foreknowledge is welded to the predestination--the
   predestination is infallibly linked with the calling! The calling with
   the justification and the justification with the glorification. There
   is no hint given that there may be a flaw or break in the series. Get a
   hold of any one and you possess the whole! The called man is the
   predestinated man. Let him be sure of that. And the justified man shall
   be a glorified man. Let him have no doubt whatever about that.

   31. What shall we say, then, to these things? If God is for us, who can
   be against us? A great many, but they are all nothing. If God is for
   us, all they that are against us are not worth mentioning! They are
   ciphers. If He were on their side, then the One would swell the ciphers
   to the fullest, but if He is not there, we may put them all into the
   scale and reckon them as less than nothing!

   32, 33. He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
   all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who
   shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?Who, indeed?

   33, 34. It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns?No one can,
   for--

   34. It is Christ that died. And so put our sins to death. 34. Yes,
   rather, that is risen again. And so has justified us.

   34. Who is even at the right hand of God. And so has carried us into
   Heaven by His representing us there.

   34. Who also makes intercession for us. Whose everlasting pleas,
   therefore, silences all the accusations of the devil!

   35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
   or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
   orsword?They have all been tried. In different ages of the world, the
   saints have undergone all these, and yet has never one of them been
   taken away from the love of Christ! They have not left off loving Him,
   nor has He left off loving them. They have been tried, I say.

   36. As it is written. For Your sake we are killed all the daylong; we
   are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. What is the result of it?

   37-39. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him
   that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
   Halleluiah! Blessed be His name!

Beholding God's Church

   (No. 3423)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   14, 1870.

   "Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof.
   Mark you well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that you may tell it
   to the generation following. For this (God is our God forever and ever:
   He will be our guide even unto death." Psalm 48:12-14.

   THE proper study of the Christian is Christ. Next to that subject is
   the Church. And though I would by no means ever urge you to think of
   the Church as, for a moment, to put her in comparison with her Lord,
   yet think of her in relation to Him. You will not dishonor the sun by
   remembering that there is a moon! You will not lessen the glory of "the
   King in His beauty" by remembering that the Queen, His Spouse, is "all
   glorious within." You will not think any less of Christ for thinking
   much of His Church. So tonight I shall invite you to a consideration of
   the honor, and glory, and dignity of the Church of God as set forth in
   these verses. And our first point will be the survey which should be
   taken of the Church--"Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count
   the towers thereof. Mark you well her bulwarks, consider well her
   palaces." Secondly, here is the objective of this survey--"That you may
   tell it to the generation following." And here is, thirdly, a very
   excellent reason given for our seeking to accomplish this
   objective--"For this God is our God forever and ever: He will be our
   guide even unto death." So, then, let us think awhile of--

   I. THE SURVEY WHICH WE SHOULD TAKE if we would become practically
   useful to coming generations--the survey we ought to take of the Church
   of God.

   And let us begin by saying it should be complete. "Walk about Zion, and
   go round about her"--go completely round the wall. The Church is set
   forth as a walled city. The description calls to my mind the city of
   Chester. There you have the old wall standing, with here and there a
   most picturesque tower or turret. Now Jerusalem stood in that way, and
   the Church of God is likened to Jerusalem. "Go round about her"--make a
   complete circuit of all her walls, try to be acquainted with all of
   Church history, with that which concerns Apostolic times, and that
   which had to do with the ages of the first Christian persecution. With
   the Reformation, with the sufferings of our fathers and covenanting
   sires. And then on to the present day. Let your survey of the Church,
   as far as possible, include all portions of it. Remember that your
   denomination is not the whole of Zion--that although you do well to
   look carefully to the quarter in which your house is situated, yet
   there are other houses of God's servants in other parts of the
   city--and you should take a survey of those regions as well as those in
   which you immediately dwell. See how your Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ fare and take their pledge and report. Let it never be a joy to
   a Baptist if he hears that some Congregational Church does not prosper.
   Let it always be a joy to a Presbyterian when he hears that a Wesleyan
   is doing good. Let it be a great joy to us if any part of the Church of
   God prospers! And if in any place there is decay or decline, let us
   bear in our prayers that particular portion of the Church of God, and
   pray Him to strengthen that part of the city wall against the foe. Let
   your survey of the Church be as complete as you can make it. "Go round
   about her."

   Let it also be frequent. I am afraid that some persons think very
   little, indeed, of the Church of God. I mean that while they know how
   the shop, and the State, and the world generally are getting on, they
   could scarcely tell how many members were added to the one Church to
   which they belong. Certainly they know little about other sections of
   the Church and, perhaps, care as little as they know! It should not be
   so with the citizens of Zion! The time to favor Zion will come when
   God's servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust
   thereof--when the very least thing that concerns the Church of God
   shall be important to the citizens of Zion! Frequently, my dear
   Friends, look not only on your ownthings, but also on the things of
   others. Does not the text say, first, "Walk about Zion"? Then it adds,
   "Go round about her," as if, after having done it once, you were to do
   it again, and yet again, and again--always caring for the Church and
   constantly making an earnest, enthusiastic inspection as to the
   prosperity of the great cause of Christ in the land.

   And let your inspection and survey be deliberate. "Count the towers
   thereof." Look at the detail, count the towers, bring your careful
   pondering into the business. Do not give a mere glance, hurrying round
   and then saying, "I saw the city, but really do not know how many
   towers there were." Study the details of the Church of which you are a
   member. Try to look after the individual interests of your Brothers and
   Sisters. There may be a backslider to recover and rejoice over. There
   may be a mourner to comfort, a seeker to direct, or a faint heart to
   encourage. Mark well the towers! "Set your heart towards them," says
   the Hebrew--do not regard the interests of the Church of God as
   secondary to anything! If the Church prospers and Christ is glorified,
   all things else are little--but if there is defeat to the armies of
   Israel, nothing can console the Christian!

   And let your inspection of the Church of God be always earnest.
   "Consider her palaces"--not a mere superficial look at the
   Church--reading the weekly paper--the weekly religious paper--which
   recounts the little events in your Zion, but consider well. I would to
   God we had many who in secret would so consider as to sigh and groan
   over the lack of love and earnestness that there is just now. The wave
   of revival seems, now, to have passed over us--and we are now like the
   shore when the sea retreats from it with the fullness of its strength.
   There needs to be some men of wisdom to discern the times and, "to know
   what Israel ought to do." Each one of us who loves the Lord, and has a
   stake in the city as citizens, should seek to consider well its
   interests and endeavor to promote them earnestly and
   strenuously--seeking first to know thoroughly what they are--that we
   may render our share towards their serving. Although this exhortation
   may seem to some to be very tame and tritely commonplace, yet how much
   I wish we were all obedient to it--and surely, then, great practical
   results would follow! There are some who manifest a keen interest in
   all that happens in the Church. If there is a missionary going abroad,
   their prayers go with him. If there is a new voice lifted up for
   Christ, they are much more pleased than if they found a bag of gold!
   These same persons are often mourners in Zion when the Gospel is not
   fully preached, when Prayer Meetings are thinly attended, when no
   conversions are made, when worldliness sweeps over the Church. And the
   more we have of such men, the better--they are sure to be the very pick
   and cream of the Church, those who walk round Jerusalem, who go round
   about her--who mark well her bulwarks and consider her palaces!

   But now let us be obedient to one of our own rules, namely, to take a
   matter in detail. So, taking the text in detail, we have, first, to
   walk about Zion, which I take to mean let us inspect the Church
   herself--let it often be a theme with us--a theme of study. What is the
   Church of God? On what is it founded? It is built upon a Rock and "the
   gates of Hell shall not prevail against it." The Church of God stands
   fast in the Immutable Love of God according to His eternal purpose
   which He purposed in Christ Jesus before the world began. The Church of
   God was designed by Infinite Wisdom. It is not a corporation of men
   that come together according to their own agreement and will, and so at
   haphazard. It is not an organization framed by the shrewd wit and
   wisdom of man. God designed the true Church in Eternity! He is the
   Architect and Builder of the Temple in which He is, Himself, to dwell.
   Not only the great outline of that plan did He mark and settle, but
   every line of it! Yes, and every stone of it--and when that stone shall
   be quarried and how it shall be qua-rried--and where it shall be
   placed, and when it shall be placed in the appointed spot! The Divine
   Will of God and the Eternal purpose may be seen running through the
   whole of the Church, and it is well for us to look often to her
   foundations and look to the Designer, the great Artifice, who builds
   all things! This Church of God, as far as it is already built, has been
   built by Divine Power alone. Instruments have been used but all the
   power is of God! There have been builders and wise master-builders, but
   still, these have been the servants employed by the great Builder of
   all! He that built all things is God. That is especially true in the
   Church of God. If there are any other buildings which have been put up
   by human might, they will assuredly crumble from their place. Only that
   which God built will endure. All men's work will pass away and,
   perhaps, the sooner the better, for wood, and hay, and stubble would
   but destroy the beauty and the completeness of that building whose
   foundations are of precious stones, and whose walls shall glisten with
   gems in that day when the top stone shall be brought forth with shouts
   of, "Grace, Grace unto it!" The Church is a wonderful piece of
   architecture and well worth our walking round because, unlike any
   other, her strength is not merely material. The Church is built up of
   living stones. Life flows through the whole. We have seen marvelous
   buildings. As I have looked at the cathedral at Milan, I could hardly
   help thinking that it looked as if it had sprung up from the earth,
   watered by somemiraculous shower! It seemed a thing of such beauty, but
   every stone was, after all, a stone. But the Church of God has grown
   under a Divine, miraculous hand, and every stone, from the foundation
   to the pinnacle glows with life! Wondrous Temple for a living God to
   dwell in! How should He dwell in temples made with hands, and pillars
   of iron, dust and ashes--things that were created but for baser uses?
   But He can live where hearts glow with emotion--where intelligence
   brightens with instruction, where holiness, peace and joy are the
   polished stones--the glory with which they glitter! It is a Temple of
   living stones--you may well go round about it!

   The Temple has a glorious history, too. Strange histories have been
   connected with buildings. What would the stones of Stonehenge tell us
   if they could speak? What secrets might not the Pyramids reveal if for
   once they could break their solitary and solemn silence? Those far away
   temples of Carnac and Baalbec--what have they beheld? What armies have
   marched by them? What nations and generations have perished and passed
   beneath their shade? But this Zion, this habitation of the living
   God--her history how grand! When does it begin? In old Eternity God has
   ordained her. Along the whole page of human history you trace her most
   distinctly. How gloriously does she shine forth at the Red Sea, when
   God works plagues on Zoan and breaks the dragon in the midst of the
   sea! How brightly does the Church shine when you mention such names as
   David and all his victories, or Sennacherib and his hosts slain by the
   avenging angel! The history of the Church of God is an aggregation of
   histories, all of them miraculous, for the Christian Church is a
   miracle so far as its life is concerned--it is life in the midst of
   death--not only life in the sepulcher, but life in the very midst of
   death itself. Spiritual life in these poor bodies is just such, but oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, I am afraid that we are too silent about the
   history of the Church! We hear continually of patriots singing of the
   brave days of old when their fathers fought the foe. We ought to sing
   more often the songs of Moses and the Lamb--that the Lord God has
   gotten to Himself the victory, and given to His people rest and
   conquest. The Church is worth going round, for her history is so
   bright.

   But best of all, the Church should be surveyed by us, because of Him
   who dwells within. It shall be said of no other place, "Here Jehovah
   specially and radiantly resides." I know men think of their ridged
   roofs and of their lofty pillars in their cathedrals, and think these
   ensure the Divine indwelling, but He is no more inside that building
   than outside! God is to be found on the loftiest mountain, as well as
   in the valley--and where the preacher stands upon a log of wood upon
   the village green, the place is just as consecrated as though a
   thousand years it had heard nothing but the song of praise and the
   voice of prayer! There are no holy places now--these are done with!
   They are the beggarly elements of the Law--in the living Church, built
   up of men and women who have been born unto God by His Spirit--there,
   Jehovah peculiarly dwells--in Heaven and in the little Heaven below in
   the midst of His elect people, whom He has ordained according to His
   purpose! There might be whole hours spent in talking about the Church,
   but enough of that first word, "Walk about Zion."

   Brothers and Sisters, I shall invite you next, in your survey of Zion,
   to observe her conspicuous towers. "Count the towers thereof." Shall I
   be counted fanciful if I say that these towers may guard the Doctrines
   of the Gospel which stand prominently round the Church of God, for the
   protection and succor of the citizens? I shall not, certainly. The
   enemy have always looked upon these as towers, for attacks have been
   made one after another upon the different parts of our most holy faith.
   For a long time our Reformers stood like a wall round the tower of
   Justification by Faith, and the whole battle seemed to be waged around
   that particular portion. After a while the conflict shifted--and it
   continues to do so from year to year and day to day. Sometimes we have
   had to contend for the true Deity of our blessed Lord. Sometimes for
   the full and Divine Inspiration of Holy Scripture. There is not a tower
   in the whole compass of the walls that guard the Church, but what has
   had to maintain siege after siege, and bear upon it the brunt of the
   attack! And what is better, the shields of the mighty have been vilely
   cast away when Zion's troops have put the enemy to rout!

   May not these towers also represent the place of observation of the
   Church? "Count the towers thereof." Where do God's watchmen go to
   observe the times, and to see what is coming? Do they not go to the
   chamber of communion, to the place of prayer, to the teaching of Holy
   Scripture and get near to God? Then are they not able to see afar off
   and to mark where the foe will make his next assault? Surely I shall
   not be wrong if I say that in our times the pulpit has to become the
   tower of the watchmen. While that is well and faithfully maintained, no
   assaults of the foe shall prevail! As the Roman Catholic priests once
   said to Krummacher, "Unless you take the pulpit out of the way, we
   shall never be able to put you down." Let the Christian, then, go and
   count the towers of the Church! Let him watch the doctrines! Let him
   learn them! Let him understand them! Let him know how to defend them!
   Let every Christian pray for the minister of the Gospel! Brothers and
   Sisters, pray for him! Count the towers and if you see one that seems
   to be badly manned with watchmen, ask that God's Grace would raise up
   other and mightier men for the defense of Holy Zion! And if there is
   anything else, if there is any place that may not have a tower, think
   of it--think of it prayerfully--and carefully regard it in your prayers
   before God as an object of your solicitude!

   But I must conduct you on, for our time flies. You are invited to an
   inspection of the ramparts of defense. "Mark you well her bulwarks."
   The bulwarks go entirely around the city--they are lines of ridges,
   ditches, trenches and fortifications. Now mark well the fortifications
   of the Church of God. God the eternal Father has thrown up a line of
   ram-parts--the Eternal Purpose--who shall frustrate it? The Everlasting
   Covenant--who shall make it void? The promise and the oath, the two
   Immutable things by which it is impossible for God to lie--who shall
   storm these two? Who shall break upon these two? We are safely defended
   behind them! The Power of God--who shall defeat it? The Wisdom of
   God--who shall outwit it? The Presence of God--who shall deprive us of
   it? The Love of God--who shall separate us from it? All these are the
   entrenchments of our Zion. When our foes have once looked upon them,
   they may well turn back with dismay. God, the Blessed One, has been
   pleased to make lines of fortifications, too. He has offered His
   precious Sacrifice--and between the Church and destruction there is the
   full stream of His atoning blood! Who, by any means, shall make the
   Atonement void, or the Cross of no effect? Between the Church and the
   foe stands the brass wall of the righteousness of Jesus Christ! God is
   not unfaithful, to forget the work of His dear Son. Stronger than iron
   is the intercession of Jesus Christ! For Zion's sake He will never
   cease or hold His peace, but will plead day and night for His people
   when they are tempted, that their faith fail not. And there is the
   mediatorial work of Christ, like a wall of fire about them. "All power
   is given unto Me in Heaven and in earth." Who shall break through, upon
   the Church, through all power? Surely these--

   "Munitions of stupendous rock, Our dwellingplace shall be! "

   And then there is the Kingdom of Christ in the latter day promised to
   come--the promise of God to come with power and take His people to
   Himself. That is a sure guarantee of the security of the Church until
   the day of manifestation and the appearing of the Son of God!

   Around the Church of God, too, the Holy Spirit has thrown up His
   rampart. He was pleased, first of all, to create the Church, and since
   that day He has preserved it safely. It is His to provide spiritual
   teaching. It is His to take of the things of Christ and show them unto
   it. It is His to comfort. It is His to sanctify. It is His to perfect.
   And all His gracious influences and operations are so many protections
   against the attacks off the foe. Aha! Aha, you enemy of Zion! If you
   had to do with poor puny men like us, you might soon put us to the
   rout! Your sophistries and worldly wisdom might soon bring us to the
   non-plus, but the Holy Spirit is with us and is in us--and we shall
   answer you with a wisdom that you shall not be able to counter!

   "The best of all is," said John Wesley, "that God is with us." "God
   with us! God with us" is the shout of our victorious host!
   "Emmanuel"--in this name we conquer--by this name we overcome! So you
   see, Brothers and Sisters, you may mark well her bulwarks--the Father,
   the Son and the Holy Spirit have securely garrisoned and bulwarked the
   Church of the living God! You are called to notice, in the fourth
   place, her palaces. On which, but a word. Of course, the houses of Zion
   were inside the walls, and so the dwelling places, the meeting places
   of Believers are inside the line of defense. What kind of dwelling
   places are these that belong to the citizens of Zion? Are they
   cottages? Is it, "Mark you well her cottages"? No, not so. Is it,
   "Consider her alms houses"? No! It is, "Consider her palaces." Palaces
   are the abodes of those of the greatest wealth, of those having rank
   and dignity in life. Then am I to understand that the people of God are
   rich? They are not in earth's wealth very often--not in perishable gold
   and silver--but in what is infinitely better! They are rich in faith,
   rich in favor, rich in the loving kindness of the Lord. Then am I to
   understand that the people of God are honorable? They are not with
   worldly honor, but God has said, "Since you were precious in My sight,
   you have been honorable." And am I to remember that the people of God
   are royal? They are kings and priests! They are the true blood-royal of
   the universe. The blood-imperial is not in the veins of those who claim
   it, but in the veins of the descendants of the King of Kings! Their
   ancestry is the highest under Heaven! They are God's aristocracy.
   Consider, then, her palaces. Where are the palaces and what are they?
   Consider then, my Brothers and Sisters, the place where the saints
   worship, for where the saints meet together for prayer and praise,
   there are the palaces! Consider them and mark them well,to love them
   and say, "How amiable are Your tabernacles, oh, Lord of Hosts, my King
   and my God." Consider the palaces of Christian fellowship, for if it is
   in a barn--when Christians meet together, they make a palace of it!
   Consider the palace of fellowship with Christ. Wherever we meet with
   Him, we are at once in a palace! Consider the palaces of the
   promises--that it is better than a promise which is spoken of in that
   word, "He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings shall
   you trust." These will be our dwelling places in all ages, and it is
   infinitely better than any earthly palace can possibly be!

   "Consider her palaces." Thus I have gone into detail round the walls of
   Zion. Now, the second thing, very briefly, is--

   II. THE OBJECTIVE TO BE ATTAINED BY OUR MAKING OURSELVES THUS
   ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHURCH OF GOD.

   It is this--"That you may tell it to the generation following." The
   Church of God should take care that what God has done for one
   generation is told to the next. How much have you and I been helped by
   what our fathers told us? Those wonderful deeds that are kept on
   record--what God did in the days of old--have ministered great
   consolation to us in this present age. Let us take care that we hand
   down to our sons and daughters a record of what God has done. The pith
   of the matter is just this--each Christian ought to take a deep
   interest in the work of God in his time, that he may know how to teach
   his children, and especially to teach those who are born unto the
   family of God. Teach the young Christian what God hasdone, isdoing and
   wllyet do for His Church! I am very thankful that I have around me a
   number of Christian people who take a deep interest in the Cross of
   Jesus Christ. I believe that you are the people who will be sure to be
   succeeded by a generation who will take an equal interest in the same
   work. But if you were not, yourselves, interested, I could not suppose
   that it would be any concern to you to hand down the sacred traditions
   of your experience to the next generation. But now I trust that you
   will take care that there shall be kept alive in the world the record,
   the experimental record, of God's mighty acts towards His people in our
   day, even as in olden times! They speak of what the Lord did. Go you,
   each of you, and tell others what God has told you! Never hide the
   precious things that God reveals to you. What He speaks to you in the
   closet, proclaim upon housetops! Of course, it is well to learn
   first--do not try to teach before you have learned--but when you have
   learned, it is well to teach it immediately. Always mark
   well--"consider," says the text--"that you may tell it to others." May
   we train up in all our Churches studious Christians, intelligent
   Christians, well-versed in all that concerns the Church of the living
   God! I believe that in proportion as Christian people are
   well-instructed, the attacks of the adversary will be repelled and
   defeated. But if we only gather together undisciplined bodies of men
   and women who merely come to hear preaching, but receive little or no
   instruction, they will become like flocks of sheep--the prey of the
   wolf whenever he shall come. Mark well, then the bulwarks of Zion, that
   when your turn comes to defend them, you may be at home in the
   battle--not come into the Church like a stranger, knowing nothing of
   what it is to do for Christ, or what Christ is doing for it. And now,
   lastly--

   III. THERE IS A REASON GIVEN WHY WE SHOULD SEEK TO TRANSMIT THE RECORDS
   OF THE

   CHURCH TO OTHER GENERATIONS.

   The story of God's love to His Church is to be told from one generation
   to another, and the reason is this--because "This God is our God
   forever and ever: He will be our guide even unto death." Observe, if
   Israel could change their God, it could as well forget what had
   occurred, but as she will have the same God forever and ever, let her
   remember what God did for her of old! And as that God will be the same
   to us, let each of us treasure up memories of what He has worked for
   us--for these are instructive as to what we may hope for in the future!
   He that helped you in years past will not fail you now. He that proved
   Himself faithful 20 years ago is faithful today. Is God All-Sufficient
   in your childhood? Is God All-Sufficient in your old age? With Him is
   no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Remember, then, the past
   mercies are as forge ashes, from which you may gather the spark that
   may light the fire of today, and that even the future may be indebted
   to the same blaze!

   Besides, we may well recollect what God has done, for if we tell it to
   others, we shall never have to retract, for God will continue to do the
   same as He always did. I am afraid that the Church has grown very
   faint-hearted as to the dealings of the Lord with her. We hardly expect
   to see such things done, as in the first age of the Church. "That was
   the heroic period," it is said, "but now we are in our decline." It is
   not so with this God of the Apostles! This God of the martyrs! This God
   of the Reformers! This God of Wesley and of Whitfield--this God is our
   God not for time only, but forever and ever--and I dare not give you
   any restricted sense of "forever and ever." There are some people who
   expect the Lord will want to turn us out of Heaven at the end of a
   certain time, or they must think, so to carry out their belief, that
   "forever and ever" may mean only for a limited time! That is one of the
   modern heresies of these boasted times. But for my part I believe,
   "forever," means forever and ever! And this God is our God, not for
   ages and ages, but forever and ever, world without end--beyond any
   possibility of coming to a conclusion! And He will be the same God
   right through the ages, onward. "And He will be our guide even unto
   death." Now, the text is not altogether correct in the translation of
   the Hebrew, for, "unto death," might very well be rendered "out
   of--beyond--death." He will be our guide to the River Jordan, and He
   will be our guide through it! He will be our guide into Canaan, where
   we shall rest forever, and never more be driven out! Well, then, may we
   talk of what He has done, because He will always go on to do the same!
   We may keep on talking even to Eternity, about what the Lord has done,
   for no period in Eternity (if periods there can be) can ever witness
   any change in the Most High! He will still be the same just God to the
   ungodly, and the same gracious God to His own people forever and
   forever!

   Oh, talk you, then, of His mighty acts! Study them, and learn them! And
   then speak of them with the tongue, like the pen of a ready writer, or
   if you go stammering, let the tongue of the dumb sing with you! Oh, to
   speak of the everlasting mercy of our God! On such a theme as this,
   they who have been heretofore silent may grow into orators, for the
   history of the Church of God and the story of God's love might well
   unloose our stammering tongues and make us tell of His immense,
   unsearchable love! Would to God that all the Church were orators for
   Him! Would that you who belong to this Church were! Many, I know,
   belong to divers sections of it, but alas, some are, perhaps, members
   of this Church, yet not members of the Church of God! And some of you
   are not even professedly members of God's Church. May you be converted!
   May you listen to the Gospel, whose message you doubt! It is a message
   even to you--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved." This is the Gospel that He has sent us to preach, saying these
   words, "Go you into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every
   creature. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that
   believes not shall be condemned." God bless and save you, for Christ's
   sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 58:1-12, JEREMIAH 30; ISAIAH
   58:1-12.

   Verses 1, 2. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet,
   and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their
   sins. Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways as a nation
   that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God:
   they ask of Me the ordinances of justice: they take delight in
   approaching God. And what a strange thing this is, that there are some
   people who take delight in the ordinances of God and yet they are
   living in the most shameful sin. I must confess this remains a mystery
   to me. But I hear of some who will attend Prayer Meetings and seem to
   enjoy them--who are to be found in the House of God whenever the doors
   are opened, and yet, their characters will not bear the Light of God.
   One would think that they would not wish to be told of their sins, and
   to come under a faithful ministry--and yet they do--and the more
   faithful that ministry is, the more they seem to like it, and yet go on
   in their sins! Oh, what strange blindness is this which loves the Light
   and yet will not see by it--men that take to themselves niter and much
   soap, and yet will not wash--that heap up the bread about them as if
   they built a house with bread, and yet do not eat of it! Oh,
   infatuation most strange, to apparently love the Gospel and yet not to
   receive it into the heart so as to be changed by it. See how God talks
   to this religious people.

   3. Why have we fasted, say they, and You see not? Why have we afflicted
   our soul, and You take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast,
   you find pleasure, and exact all your labors. They fasted and then they
   said, "Why did not God accept our fasting?" Why, because they made
   their poor servants work up to the very last all that they could do!
   They never gave them any rest. They exacted all their labors and they,
   themselves, while they pretended to faint, were taking their pleasure!

   4. Beholdyou fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
   wickedness: you shall not fast as you do this day so make your voice to
   be heard on high. They were fond of getting into religious disputes.
   And when they had a fast day they fell to loggerheads about different
   doctrines, and they got angry with one another, till they began to
   smite with the fist of wickedness! And they thought that a day spent in
   that manner would be acceptable to God? What kind of a God would He be?

   5, 6. Is it such a fast that Ihave chosen? A day for a man to afflict
   his soul?Is it to bow down his headas a bulrush, and to spread
   sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and an
   acceptable day to the LORD? Is not this the fast that Ihave chosen? To
   loosen the bands of wickedness. That is, if by any dishonesty you have
   got a man in your power, set him free--if you have oppressed him, give
   him his rights. This in God's kind of fasting!

   6. To undo the heavy burden. Not to exact from a man what you have no
   right to have, but what, perhaps, the law may allow you to get out of
   him. This is God's fasting--"to undo the heavy burdens."

   6, 7. And to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke.
   Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry?It is God's kind of fasting
   to give what you would have eaten yourselves to the other's feast. "To
   deal your bread to the hungry."

   7, And that you bring the poor that are cast out of your house? When
   you see the naked, that you co ver him: and that you hide not yourself
   from your own fesh? When you know that there are poor persons, perhaps
   of your own kith and kin--and, in one respect, we are all of one
   flesh--when we know that there are such, and yet refuse to help them,
   it is idle to talk about fasting! But if we would see to this, then
   comes this promise.

   8, 9. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health
   shall spring forth speedily: and your righteousness shall go before
   you; the Glory of the LORD shall be your reward. Then shall you call,
   and the LORD shall answer: you shall cry, and He shall say, Here I am.
   If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, theputting forth of
   the finger That is, the scorning the poor man.

   9-11. And speaking vanity. And if you draw out your soul to the hungry
   and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall your light rise in
   obscurity, and your darkness be as the noon day. And the LORD shall
   guide you continually and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat
   your bones. You see, by giving comes getting! According to the
   philosophy of God, it is by watering others that we get watered
   ourselves! God feeds the man that feeds others. He made fat the bones
   of the hungry. Now God says He will make fat his bones. He satisfied
   the souls of those that were in drought as best he could, and now God
   will satisfy his soul in drought and make him--

   11, 12. And you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of
   water, whose waters fail not And they that shall be of you shall build
   the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many
   generations and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The
   restorer of paths to dwell in.God help us to obey His precept that we
   may partake in His promise!

   JEREMHAH30.

   12, For thus says the LORD, Your bruise is incurable and your wound is
   grievous. See here is the bass again. We have got down into the
   sorrowful notes--all to make us sick of self and ready to receive the
   Grace of God.

   13, 14. There is none topleadyour cause, thatyou may be bound up. You
   have no healing medicines. Allyourlov-ers have forgotten you. Out of
   sight, out of mind. They have forgotten you. Oh, when God wounds, it is
   a wound, indeed! When He breaks the heart, who can comfort? If He does
   but speak, the earth trembles. He touches the hills and they smoke--

   "When He shuts up in long despair, Who can remove the iron bar?"

   14, 15. They seekyou not; for Ihave woundedyou with the wound of an
   enemy, with the chastisement ofa cruel one for the multitude of your
   iniquity; because your sins were increased. Why cry you for your
   affliction? Your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your
   iniquity. "These are dark words," says one. If they are incurable, what
   more need be said? Ah, the things incurable with men are curable with
   God! Sin is the malady that none can cure but God alone.

   15, 16. Because your sins were increased, Ihave done these things unto
   you. Therefore--Now I read this, this morning, and I could not help
   dwelling upon this, "therefore." It looks like a non sequitur, but
   there is a real argument in it. Therefore, because you have now come to
   the worst, because you cannot help yourself, because you are ruined and
   undone--

   16, 17. All they that devour you shall be devoured: and all your
   adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that
   spoil you shall be a spoil, andall thatprey upon you will Jgive for a
   prey. For I willrestore health unto you. Oh, the Sovereignty of Divine
   Grace! How it comes in when every hope is gone! Man's extremity is
   God's opportunity! An incurable sinner and, therefore, God comes to
   cure him! If you are brought so low that you cannot go any lower, God
   will put His everlasting arms underneath you. I speak to some, tonight,
   who are about to enter into peace, joy and rest. "I will restore health
   unto you; I will heal you of your wounds, says the Lord."

   17. And I will heal you of your wounds, says the LORD; because they
   called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
   They said, "There is no hope for that man, there is no relief for that
   woman. Therefore God means to give up all relief." Nothing pleases Him
   better than to undertake a desperate case! God is great at a dead lift.
   When all the world is palsied, then is God Omnipotent.

Meat Indeed, and Drink Indeed

   (No. 3424)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed." John 6:55.

   THE crowd had followed Jesus for the loaves and fishes. He gently
   upbraids them for being guided by so carnal an appetite and impelled by
   so coarse a motive to follow Him. Then He tells them that there is a
   spiritual meat which is far better--a spiritual drink far richer than
   those things which nourish the body and gratify the animal tastes.
   After which, speaking of Himself spiritually, He says, "My flesh is
   meat indeed"--real meat, such as supports the soul, and, "My blood is
   drink indeed"--real drink, the best, the truest beverage, such as
   invigorates the spirit for immortality!

   Why, you may ask, on the outset, does our Lord speak of His flesh and
   blood as separated? I tried to explain that some time ago when we
   gathered around this Table. There must be, in the Lord's Supper, bread
   and wine--but bread separated from the wine--as our Lord speaks of His
   flesh as separate from His blood, and this was to indicate that it is
   as a dying Savior that He is most precious to us. The blood separated
   from the flesh indicates death. It is to the death of Jesus that the
   Believer first turns His eyes and it is when considering the living,
   reigning Christ as having once been slain that our richest comfort
   comes to us. So it is not an unnecessary multiplication of words, or a
   vain repetition of the same idea, when our Lord says to us, "My flesh
   is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." He thereby denotes
   Himself as the dyingChrist.

   Taking the words as they stand, our first point will be that--

   I. THE FLESH OF CHRIST IS MEAT INDEED--SPIRITUAL MEAT.

   The likeness is emphatic--it is "meat indeed." I t is like meat because
   meat, or food, sustains the body. The body could not be kept in vigor
   ordinarily or without a miracle, except by the use of food. We pine, we
   languish, we sicken, we die without bread! So the soul without Jesus,
   supposing it to be alive, must soon sicken, pine, be famished and
   decay. You, O Believer, with all your strength would be weak as water
   at this moment if Jesus were not now your present support! All your
   past experience would go for nothing if you had not now a present
   Christ to stay your hopes upon. It would be only a matter of time with
   you--you would before long sink into the corruption of an open
   apostasy. Like a man shut up in a dungeon and deprived of food who
   drags out for a few days, a most painful existence and, at the last,
   expires and becomes carrion, so must it be with you. Unless Jesus
   Christ is your daily meat, you would go back to the carnal elements of
   the world and become corrupt and depraved as others are! Christ is the
   only true sustenance of the quickened soul. But, mark you, let a man
   eat what meat he may, it does not always so sustain him but that he is
   not sometimes weak and stretched upon the bed of languishing. It cannot
   so sustain him but that before long he must be carried to his grave.
   But if your souls learn to feed on Jesus, they shall enjoy the blessed
   immunity promised to the inhabitants of Zion--they shall not say, "I am
   sick"--they shall never die! They shall feed on this immortal bread
   such as angels eat. You shall be carried up to the seats of the
   immortals to dwell forever with the Christ upon whom you have fed,
   coming to Him first to appease your hunger--and believing on Him
   continuously to sustain your life!

   Meat not only provides substance, but it assists growth. The child
   cannot develop into an adult if he is denied his daily food. He must
   certainly die in infancy or in childhood if he is without the nutriment
   which is requisite to the building up of his bodily frame. Now,
   Brothers and Sisters, we are babes in Grace, many of us. We have been
   brought to Jesus' feet, and as such, we are of those who make up His
   Kingdom, but we need to grow into spiritual manhood. We are not content
   with little faith, dim hope and a spark of love. We need to attain unto
   perfection in spiritual things--I mean to be perfectly developed men
   and women strong in the fullness of spiritual energy--and this can only
   be by Christ. Onlycan you grow as you increase in the knowledge of Him
   and in subjection to the influences of His indwelling Spirit. As food
   makes our bodies grow, so Christ is food to our souls--He is "meat
   indeed"--for He makes us grow after a Divine sort. Let a man feed upon
   what meat he may, he shall not come unto absolute perfection. But let
   him feed on Jesus and he shall! Through the Grace of God in Christ
   Jesus we shall yet come to the fullness of the stature of men in
   Christ. Up there they are all men in Christ. Before the Throne of God
   they are all perfect and without fault--and this because they have fed
   upon this sacred meat which makes them grow until they come unto the
   perfect image of Him they feed upon!

   Meat does not only sustain and cause growth, but it makes up for the
   daily waste of the body. Some people forget that every exertion of the
   body wears it away as truly as the machine spends its fuel and wastes
   itself. As even an engine of iron needs repair, so does this body of
   ours, and the meat we feed upon goes to repair the daily waste to which
   bone, and muscle, and nerve are all subjected. Beloved, Jesus Christ,
   in this sense, is meat. "He restores my soul." He makes up for the
   waste of temptation, for the wear and tear of care, for the fret of
   trouble, for the fume and flurry of manifold anxie-ties--for everything
   that would waste a man away. My soul once again renews her strength
   like the eagle when she sips from the brook that flows from the foot of
   the Cross. Oh, Believer, you will soon degenerate--this world of sin
   will soon make you backslide and lose every good thing you have unless
   you go continually to Christ and feed on Him! But feeding on Him, the
   world shall not hurt you, temptations shall not wound you, your trials
   shall not overwhelm you, for you shall find His flesh to be meat
   indeed! The best meat that man's body can receive will not always
   repair the waste. After a certain period of life, the body must decay,
   and the most nutritious diet cannot prevent the hair, the teeth, the
   eyes, the legs, the arms--the entire man--from discovering that the
   hour of prime has passed and that the time of decay has arrived! Bend
   must the man and lean upon his staff, and eat or drink what he will,
   according to the strictest diet and regimen of the physician, yet still
   the time of waste has come. They who look out of the windows shall be
   darkened. The teeth shall fail because they are few, and the pillars of
   the house shall tremble. But, Beloved, His flesh is "meat indeed,"
   because they that feed upon Him shall still bring forth fruit in old
   age! They shall be fat and flourishing, to show that the Lord is
   upright. Their last days shall be their best days and, instead of
   declining, they shall gather strength with the multiplying years till
   the very moment when heart and flesh shall fail, and then shall be the
   instant when the strength of their souls and their portion forever
   shall be most fully revealed to them!

   Moreover, meat is a great remover of pain and disease. Without meat, or
   without food of some kind, a man's inward constitution becomes full of
   gnawing and anguish. Bitter are the grips of hunger. Perhaps no pain
   can be more severe, when a man is long exposed to it, than hunger, with
   the exception of thirst. No doubt, lack is the root of multitudes of
   the diseases of the poor. Generous diet often does more for the sick
   than the best medical prescriptions. It is certainly so with Believers
   in Christ. His flesh is meat indeed in this respect. The pains of
   conviction, the throbs of a guilty conscience--all are stopped when a
   man gets Christ! If a man is spiritually sick with worldliness, with
   doubt, with pride, with envy--with anything that is the common sickness
   of the child of God--let him get but a hearty feast upon the flesh of
   Jesus, and the disease will fly away! Christ puts such vigor into the
   spiritual system of His own people when they feed on Him, that it
   drives out diseases as strong men cast them off by the very force of
   constitution! Blessed and happy is he who eats this flesh, for it is in
   this sense, meat indeed!

   Once more, meat is used constantly by us for the development of
   strength. The man ill-fed cannot lift the weights that another can who
   has a more generous diet upon his table. Lowness of food brings
   littleness of strength. Now Jesus Christ is the only food that can make
   His people strong for service. Feed on Him and you shall run and not be
   weary! You shall walk and not faint. It is meat indeed because it gives
   us strength that is all but boundless. It clothes a mortal man with the
   might of God. It makes the feeblest Christian in the Church, when he
   has fed upon Christ, to be as a giant to suffer or to do!

   I cannot enlarge upon all these points, though there is enough in any
   one of them for a sermon, but, dear child of God, seek after Christ and
   be not satisfied until daily you are fed and nourished upon Him.

   The word, "indeed" gives the sentence an air of strong protest. We must
   take this into consideration. Why does He say that His flesh is meat
   indeed? It is in opposition to mere animal and corporeal food which is
   meat, but not meat indeed. You think that bread is solid. So it is,
   speaking one way--but what does it support? It supports the body, and
   the body, you say, is substantial. So indeed it is to the eye and to
   the touch--but what is the body? All flesh is grass, and all the
   goodliness thereof as the flower of the field; the grass withers and
   the flower thereof fades away; surely the people aregrass. This body is
   so little a while, here, and so soon dissolved, that I may safely call
   it but a shadow! And the food that feeds the shadow is but a shade. And
   what is the soul within us? Why, that, you say, is unreal. Truly so,
   Sirs, to smell, to sight, to touch--but not to real thought! The real
   thing about a man is his inward self, which you cannot see--his secret,
   impalpable, unseen, immortal self that never dies! Time's tooth does
   not touch it, nor does the scythe of Death cut it down. The soul is the
   real thing--not the body--and, Sirs, the food which feeds the soul is
   the real food, after all, and though the men of the world turn on their
   heels and say, "Ah, no, the bread and cheese that we put into our
   mouths-- that is the real thing--give us plenty of that!" Sirs, 'tis
   the shadow, but the Truths of God you give your souls to feed
   upon--that it is which in God's sight, in the sight of wise men and in
   your sight, if you have any spiritual discernment-- is meat indeed!

   It is meat indeed in contrast with the typical meats of the Old
   Testament. There was the Paschal Supper--surely that was a glorious
   feast when, by it, the people went their way out of Egypt rejoicing.
   Yes, but 'twas only a deliverance from a common temporal slavery. They
   that eat the Paschal Lamb are delivered from the bondage of death and
   Hell, for His flesh is meat indeed! In the wilderness they ate the
   manna. Yes, but every day it seemed to tell them its own unsubstantial
   character, from the fact that if they kept it till the next morning it
   bred worms and stank. But our Lord Jesus Christ is food that never
   corrupts! Feed on Him, lay Him up in your hearts and you shall find no
   corruption there, nor shall you die. In the old Tabernacle and the
   Temple there were the loaves of showbread and these were meat for the
   priest. Ah, but the showbread was nothing but a type--and to the
   priest, however devoutly he might receive it, the showbread, in itself,
   was no food for his real self, but only for his corporeal frame. And I
   may say the same of the bread which we have upon the table here,
   tonight! There is nothing in it--it is a mere emblem and a sign. But
   Christ's flesh is meat indeed! When I have sometimes seen this text put
   over the table commonly used for what is called the "Sacrament," I have
   trembled lest people should be led into the grievous and unnatural
   error of Transubstantiation. When our Lord said, "My flesh is meat
   indeed," He could not mean that bread on the table, for the Lord's
   Supper was not then instituted! In this particular text, at any rate,
   there can be no allusion of any kind to what is called, "the Mass," by
   some, or by others called, "the Sacrament," because these things were
   not brought forward by our Lord until within a few hours of His
   death--and He is now speaking months before that time! Beloved, the
   bread is bread, and nothing but bread, and so far as it points you,
   like a signpost, to the real flesh of Christ, so far so good. If you
   stop there, I can only say of it that bread is meat, but the flesh of
   Christ is meat indeed.

   When our Lord says, "My flesh is meat indeed," He clearly distinguishes
   it from every other kind of soul food. There are many sorts of soul
   food. Some men feed their souls on their own works. "Oh," they say, "we
   have prayed. We have fasted! We have given to the poor. We have been
   upright, we have been righteous"--and their soul feeds on that, though
   it is all wind! But if they trusted in Christ, it would be meat indeed.
   Some feed on ceremonies. They have been baptized, christened, confirmed
   and I know not what besides. Fine confectionery this, but it is all
   wind! Christ received into the soul and trusted in for salvation, is
   meat indeed! Some have grown up with false doctrines, or with true ones
   exaggerated, and these bring them to a very fine development of
   self-conceit and bigotry--but they make no solid food for the man's
   mind. But oh, Beloved, when a man can say, "My hope is in the Crucified
   alone--I look to Him every day, my meditations are on Him, my reading
   is much about Him, my prayers are sent to Heaven all through Him, my
   praises are for Him, He is my soul's great joy, comfort, strength, and
   help"--then he has got the meat indeed! He will be a strong man to
   overcome his sin! He will be a holy man, a happy man, a heavenly man
   and, by-and-by, he shall be caught up to dwell where Jesus is, on whom
   he has fed.

   I hope I have made this clear. It is thinking upon Jesus, trusting in
   Jesus that is the eating Jesus, Himself, being the food. Those who
   trust in Him and rest in Him have got the best of soul meat. They have
   got meat indeed!

   II. CHRIST'S BLOOD IS DRINK INDEED.

   Like drink to the body, the blood of Jesus, that is to say, the merits
   of His atoning Sacrifice sustains. The body is not to be built up
   without some liquid--the system needs it. The soul is not to be
   sustained without considering and resting on the substitutionary
   suffering of Jesus. That Jesus died in my place and suffered for my sin
   is to stimulate my hope, my comfort, my joy--in a word, my whole
   soul--just as drink invigorates the physical system.

   Drink refreshes the body. The traveler is faint. It is a hot, burning
   day. That cool brook--how different the man looks when he bathes his
   face in it and drinks a sweet, cooling draught. And so the blood of
   Jesus refreshes the man who trusts in it. If I trust that Jesus was
   punished for me and I am clear that Jesus died for me, how my soul
   seems to have got a new life! How it revives! Though he were dead, yet
   should he live who could believe in this. He who could trust in the
   precious blood, though despair held him in a fainting fit so that he
   could not stir hand or foot, yet if this precious Doctrine of a Savior
   dying for him were believed by him, his heart and his spirit must
   revive at once!

   Drink also cleanses the body I do not mean washing, but that the
   reception of the water into the system flushes all the various
   departments of the frame and, no doubt, the liquid always has upon the
   human body a healthy influence. Unless it is taken, however it may be,
   intemperately. It is, to a great extent, made the life-fluid of the
   system. Now, whenever you get Jesus Christ into the soul, how it seems
   to set the veins right even if the blood is wrong! How it flushes out
   all impurities from the spiritual system--and the more you really come
   to rest upon a bleeding Christ, the more sure you are to get rid of
   your sins--I mean your reigning sins, your besetting sins, for we can
   overcome them only through the blood of the Lamb. Christ's blood is
   thus drink indeed!

   Drink also cheers the man. How many a faint heart has been cheered when
   the cooling draught has been brought! The fainting one has opened her
   eyes and smiled. And, oh, how the thoughts of a dying Christ revives
   the fainting soul and make the spirit sing that once was ready to moan
   and cry, "I am forgotten! I am forsaken. I am lost!"

   Notice the word, "indeed," how it comes in again--"My blood is drink
   indeed," in opposition to all carnal drink, for as I said about the
   food--that it is but a shadow to support a shadow, so it is with the
   drink--it is but a shade to support a shade. Christ's blood supports
   the spirit--therefore, it is drink indeed.

   How superior to all typical drinks! There was the water which flowed
   from the Rock when it was struck. There were the various drinks with
   the meat offerings, but Jesus Christ is the fullness of which these
   were but the shadows!

   Christ says, "My blood is drink indeed," as though utterly ignoring all
   other soul drinks. Some men drink until they are drenched with earthly
   pleasure. Others drink until they are inflated with their own
   self-righteousness. The Devil has his cups and he knows how to fill
   them to the brim and make them sparkle and fascinate the eyes. But let
   men's souls drink of these draughts till they come to the dregs, they
   shall never be satisfied! And in the world to come their misery shall
   be greater if they have had any satisfaction here. But oh, if your soul
   can get to the precious blood of Christ and rest there, and you can
   rejoice that Jesus died for you, you may drink but you shall never be
   inebriated! You may drink, but you shall never know satiety! You may
   drink and you shall have a satisfaction which nothing can destroy,
   which time or habit cannot cause to pall on your palate and of which
   eternity shall be but a blessed prolongation! Drink, thirsty soul,
   drink at the Fountain of the Savior's blood and you shall thirst no
   more, but cry, "I have enough! I have found in Jesus' atoning blood all
   that my soul can want!" Put these two things together. It appears,
   according to the text, that--

   III. OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST IS BOTH MEAT AND DRINK TOGETHER,

   So I would have you notice the suitability of Jesus Christ to man's
   needs. Man needs meat and drink. Jesus is what man needs! You need
   pardon--you have it in Christ. You need life--eternal life--you have it
   in Christ! You need peace, comfort, happiness--you have it all in
   Christ. No key ever fitted a lock as well as Christ fits a sinner. You
   are empty-- Christ is full! You cannot have a need that He cannot
   supply. There never was and there never will be, a soul that was past
   the power of Jesus. Oh, what a suitable Savior He is to me! That I can
   say, for if Jesus Christ had been sent into this world for me, only, He
   could not have suited me better than He does! And if He had been sent
   for you, only, poor trembling Sinner, He could not have fitted you
   better than He will! Why, when I think of Jesus, He seems to be all
   mine, and I am sure I cannot afford to do without a bit of Him. I need
   Him altogether and He just exactly fills my soul up to the brim--and
   you shall find it true, also! He will be your meat and your drink and
   if you get Him, you will say--

   "All my capacious powers could wish,

   In You do richly meet.

   Nor to my eyes is light so dear,

   Nor friendship half so sweet." If Jesus Christ is thus meat and drink
   together, what fullness there is in Him! He is not only one thing, and
   not only the other, but He is both! A man with meat would die, let him
   have as much as he pleased of it, if there were nothing to drink. A man
   with drink would die if there were nothing solid for him to eat. Jesus
   does not give us part salvation, but He gives us all of it! You shall
   find in Jesus Christ everything that will be needed between Hell and
   Heaven. All the way, from the gates of Hell to the pearly gates of
   Paradise, every need of every pilgrim is met in Him. Ten thousand time
   ten thousand as His people are, yet all of them receive all that they
   need from Him, for, "It has pleased the Father that in

   Him should all fullness dwell." "All fullness"--mark the word.
   "Fullness" is a big word but "all fullness" is bigger, and all fullness
   dwells in Him--that is, it is remaining in Him, always fullness and
   always remaining all fullness--that is the greatest word of all. He is
   both meat and drink, He is all that we need!

   Consider, too, that if Christ is both meat and drink, what need we have
   of Him--because there is no need in the world, I suppose, that is
   greater than the need of food--of meat and drink. You hear the cry of,
   "Fire!" in the street and it startles you. But those who have ever
   heard the cry of, "Bread!" in a bread riot, say that the cry of,
   "Fire!" is nothing to it. There is something so sharp, so awful, so
   determined, so ferocious, so like the yell of wild beasts, about men
   and women that scream for bread, that it is the most awful thing that
   is ever heard. And, "Drink!" What a word that must be for a number of
   poor wretches shut up, as they were, in the Black Hole of Calcutta,
   raving through those little windows at the guard outside for drink and
   stretching out their hands and beseeching them to turn their carbines
   upon them and shoot them, rather than let them die there a lingering
   death of suffocation and of thirst! How, when a little water was passed
   in, they fought and struggled for it, if so be a man might but get a
   drop, or suck a handkerchief that had been dipped into it, and linger
   on a little longer. Now, nobody can have a greater need than an actual
   need of bread and water, but that is what you need, my dear Friends.
   You need Christ! Your soul needs this very bread and water. Think not
   that you are rich and increased in goods if you have not got Christ,
   for in truth you are naked, and poor, and miserable! If you do not
   trust Him, love Him, serve Him, your poor soul has not even a drop to
   drink! What can it do but die? And oh, what must be its wretchedness
   when your soul shall ask for a drop of water to cool its tongue,
   tormented in that flame? While others are feasting, you shall have the
   gnashing of your hungry teeth to be your endless portion. God grant you
   may not be so cruel to your souls as to starve them by going without
   Christ.

   Yes, and if Christ is meat and drink, what need there is of a real
   reception of Him. If you get meat and drink, you cannot make any use of
   them unless you eat and drink them. Take meat to a hungry man--hold it
   out on your finger and ask him, "Don't you feel better?" "No," he says.
   "Look at it, Man; look at it!" "No, I feel more hungry." "But cut it!
   Here is the knife." "Oh," he says, "what is the use of that? You mock
   me! I need to get it between my teeth! I need to get it worked into my
   system, or else it is of no use to me." Hearer, of what service is it
   to you that you come and listen, Sunday after Sunday, some of you, but
   never decide to trust Christ and take Him into your soul? Why, you do
   but hear me, as it were, pour out the water, and you do not drink! You
   see it sparkle as I speak of it, but you do not receive it. What is the
   good of it to you? Oh, you will perish, some of you--you will perish
   with the bread within your reach--with the clean brook of Eternal Life
   flowing at your feet! Oh, why this folly? It is not so in other things.
   Men are not satisfied with seeing gold--they want to take it home and
   put it in their pockets! And how is it that they are content with
   hearing about Christ--with talking about Christ--but never asking for
   real faith, and for vital union with the Lord Jesus Christ? See to
   this, I pray you--and see to it soon--or death will see to you!

   Moreover, Beloved, if Jesus Christ be both meat and drink--Beloved in
   the Lord, I speak to you now--what reason there is for giving thanks! I
   said, in the reading, that a man is very unmannerly, very beastlike,
   who sits down to his meat and his drink without thanks. Well, then my
   Soul, whenever you come to feed on Christ--whenever you think on Him--
   and that should be always, always give thanks! The true spirit of a
   Christian is perpetual thankfulness. I like the remark of a dear friend
   who is present now, who, when the November fogs began, said to me on a
   Sunday morning, "I tell all my family to be more cheerful than ever,
   now the dreary weather has come, so as to shake off all these things
   that are around by keeping up cheerfulness within." Now, you are always
   feeding on Christ, and so every time you feed, you ought to give
   thanks! Therefore, as you are always feeding on Christ, "rejoice in the
   Lord always, and again, I say, rejoice." They used to call this Supper
   in the ancient Church, as we sometimes do now, "the Eucharist"--the
   giving of thanks. Well, let the life of the Christian be a constant
   Eucharist, and as he feeds on Jesus always, let it always be with this
   tribute of praise, "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift."

   Yes, and if Jesus Christ is meat and drink, then here is a reason why
   you Christians should be very earnest to tell of Him to others--to hand
   Him out. Oh, if we had this house full of bread, tonight, and there
   were a famine all over Lon-don--in the East End, the West End, and the
   North, and the South--and men were dropping down dead in the streets,
   and they were crowding outside there, out at the Elephant and Castle
   and down Newington Causeway, I know what I would say if the bread
   belonged to me--"Brothers and Sisters, come and help me out of the
   windows with it! Let them come in at every door! Let them crowd at
   every window and let them have something to eat!" And if they were
   thirsty, and we had the mains laid on here, and there was no water to
   be had anywhere else, oh, I am sure there is not a little child here
   that would not be glad to take his little tin can and hand out a
   draught of water to the thirsty people! Well, you then, with little
   abilities, who love Christ--tell about Him to others! He is meat and
   drink to the famished, thirsty ones! If He were merely a dainty, I
   could not press it, but as He is a very necessity to the dying sons of
   men, tell them about Him! And if they despise Him, well, then, you have
   done your part. But if they perish without your telling them of Christ,
   their blood may lie at your door! Oh, think, while you are going home
   tonight, walking down the streets, whether there is any house you pass
   where there is a man living who can charge you with having neglected
   him! Do not let it be so any longer, but seek that, as Christ's flesh
   is meat indeed and His blood is drink indeed, you may hand out Jesus
   Christ to the famishing crowds that they may be satisfied! The Lord
   bless you richly, for His name's sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN6:41-66.

   Verses 41-44. The Jews then murmured at Him because He said, I am the
   bread which came down from Heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus,
   the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that
   He says, I came down from Heaven? Jesus therefore answered and said
   unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. No man can come to Me except He
   who has sent Me, draw him. And I will raise him up at the last day.
   Christ never retracted a Truth of God or diminished its force because
   it was rejected, but He rather seemed to say, "You refused this Truth.
   I knew you would. You need not murmur: you are none of Mine. If you had
   been, the Father would have drawn you. You will not come. So you are
   set against the Truth of God that you cannot see it. So blind are your
   eyes that you do not behold it. No man can come to Me, except the
   Father, who has sent Me, draws him."

   45. It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
   Every man, therefore, who has heard, and has learned of the Father,
   comes unto Me. Beware, dear Friends, of any learning of Christ except
   by Divine teaching, for what we learn merely from the lips of our
   fellow men will never be vitally learned or really understood. We must
   be all taught of God--and so we shall be if, indeed, we are among these
   whom the Father draws towards Christ. All His teachings draw that way,
   and when they are taught into the inner man--not so much to the mind as
   to the soul and heart-- then do we know the Truth, indeed!

   46, 47. Not that any man has seen the Father save he which is of God,
   he has seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
   believes on Me has everlasting life. One of the richest passages surely
   of all holy Scripture! It is all marrow and fatness, but here you seem
   to have the quintessence! We have eternal life if we are Believers--not
   shall have it, but have it now! We have a life which is eternal. It is
   idle to talk of our losing it, because it would not be eternal if we
   did! We have a life within us which can by no possibility ever die, but
   must live on forever. "He that believes on Me, though he has many
   tremblings--though he may be the subject of many infirmities--yet he
   that believes on Me has everlasting life." O my Soul, exult in that
   glorious Truth of God! You have everlasting life as surely as you have
   faith in Christ!

   48. I am that bread of life. The food on which that everlasting life
   lives--living bread for living souls. O Brothers and Sisters, the dead
   letter is of no use to us! All the truth in the world, unless it be
   quickening, cannot feed our quickened natures. It is Incarnate Truth,
   even Christ, that we must feed upon! "I am that bread of life."

   49, 50 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This
   is the bread which comes down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof
   and not die For that manna of theirs was corruptible. We read that it
   bred worms and stank, and though it was an angels' food for a time, yet
   it was but temporary. It only fed a temporary life and, like that life,
   it passed away. But Jesus Christ is incorruptible, and they that live
   on Him live on incorruptible food which nourishes the incorruptible
   seed which lives and abides forever!

   51, 52. I am the living bread which came down from Heaven: if any man
   eats of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will
   give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The
   Jews, therefore, argued among themselves, saying, How can this Man give
   us his flesh to eat?They misunderstood the Master. They tarried in the
   letter, and did not reach to the spirit--the meaning--and that letter
   killed them, for "the letter kills: the spirit gives life." The inward
   meaning is that on which the soul feeds. And so the unhappy Humanist
   believes that he can literally eat the flesh of Christ, which, if it
   were true, were monstrous and could be of no service to him! Of what
   value is one flesh more thananother flesh, if it is to be considered
   carnally? He loses the inner meaning. Blessed are they who are drawn of
   the Father and taught of the Lord--who spy out what is, after all, so
   little concealed beneath the thin veil of the metaphor.

   53. Then Jesus said unto them.What? Do you think He explained it? No,
   He did not explain to these Jews. They were given up to judicial
   blindness. They had so long refused to see, that now they must not see,
   for on them was come the curse that, seeing they should not see, and
   hearing they should not perceive. Oh, how terrible this is when this
   falls on a man! And I think I know some upon whom it must have fallen.
   They have indulged the philosophical vein, always spiritualizing and
   cutting out the soul of Truth, and they are given up to spiritualizing
   as many of the great German philosophers evidently have been, who
   cannot now receive a plain statement, however simple are the words, but
   from their natural habit of continually twisting and tearing to pieces,
   they do so with everything! And a man may be an unbeliever so long that
   it will never be given to him to be a Believer again! God grant we may
   never make scales for our own eyes, and so plug up the soul's mental
   vision with the miry clay of sin, that henceforth, even though the
   eternal Christ flashes the Divine Truth into our eyes, we shall only be
   dazzled by it into a greater darkness! So it was with these men. Jesus
   did not explain to them. He just repeated the Truth more emphatically
   and made it more offensive to them than before. May a preacher
   sometimes be offensive in his preaching? He must be! He must sometimes
   feel that such a truth will only move men's wrath if he preaches it.
   Nevertheless, we are not to put the Truth of God to the verdict of a
   jury--neither is Truth to be submitted to what is called, the "inner
   consciousness" of a set of sinners whose consciousness is all defiled!
   As well make a company of highwaymen a jury about theft as make
   unconverted men to be a jury about what is the Truth of God! It cannot
   be. Christ does not condescend to that. He tells them the Truth more
   fully and more offensively than before.

   53. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son
   of Man, and drink His blood. Which He had not said before, and was more
   startling still!

   53-57. You have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh, and drinks My
   blood, has eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day. For
   My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eats My
   flesh, and drinks My blood, dwells in Me, and I in him. As the living
   Father has sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats Me, even
   he shall live by Me.You see here three living persons--the living
   Father, the living Son and the living Believer--and truly, these three
   live one life which comes from the Father by the Son into us, and we
   are made partakers of the Divine Nature, according to the Apostle's
   wondrous language, "having escaped the corruption which is in the world
   through lust." This is a great mystery which only he understands who
   feels it within himself.

   58-60. This is that bread which came down from Heaven: not as your
   fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall
   live forever These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in
   Capernaum. Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this,
   said, This is an hard saying: who can understand it?It was not merely
   the blinded Jews, but even His disciples who did not understand. Now,
   Brothers and Sisters, the test of a true disciple of Christ is that he
   is willing to believe what he does not understand! If you will only
   follow Christ's Words as far as you can comprehend them, the spirit of
   discipleship is not in you. You are the disciple of your own
   understanding! Christ is not Master, but your judgment is. But he that
   submits himself to the Words of Christ, often finds it profitable not
   to understand. Say you so? How is that? It is profitable to feel that
   we have come to the end of our own understanding. I have no doubt that
   a wise father's talk is good to his children, even though the child
   does not as yet understand him. He will lay it up in his memory. He
   will understand, one of these days, but the child--the true child's
   heart--says, "I believe you, Father, though you do puzzle me. You have
   given me a paradox which I cannot grasp, but I believe you: you are
   true." We say that of Christ and may we have even more of that spirit
   of a little child, without which we cannot receive the Kingdom of God!
   The other spirit is very rife in the world--the spirit that makes man,
   virtually, his own teacher. And, truly, I wonder not at it because
   there was originally so much of submission of the judgment to the
   dictum of the Catholic Church, or the dictum of the Pope, which is
   degrading! But to submit to Jesus and to His teaching--that is
   ennobling! May we have the same sacredly blind faith with regard to
   Christ which some have had to human authority, believing everything He
   speaks! But some of these disciples did not.

   61-62. When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it, He
   said unto them, Does this offend you? What and if you shall see the Son
   of Man ascend up where He was before?What will you say then?

   63. It is the spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing: the
   words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."You
   are not to take them as if they were flesh, and understand them
   carnally. They do but embody My words-- do but embody a living soul of
   meaning, which it will be for you to receive if you are, indeed,
   quickened. And then it will quicken you, and you will understand Me,
   and live in Me."

   64. But there are some of you that believe not. And if they do not
   believe, then they miss the whole soul of the thing! 64, 65. For Jesus
   knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should
   betray Him. And Hesaid, Therefore said I unto you that no man can come
   unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father. No, not even
   though he were an Apostle--though he came so near to Christ as to pray
   to Him and hear His secret and most private communications, and to see
   His singular and special miracles--yet he would not understand, except
   the Father gave it as a special act of Grace.

   66. From that time many of His disciples went back and walked no more
   with Him. Did He need them? I think not. He desired not to have around
   Him a mass of chaff, but the pure winnowed corn. Consequently He used
   His own Word as the winnowing fan. And I believe, Brothers and Sisters,
   that wherever Christ is faithfully preached, preaching is the best form
   of Church discipline. Somehow or other, carnal minds get weary of it,
   and they go away--and those that have not a longing and a love for the
   Truth of God drop off of themselves--so they walk no more with Him.

Days of Heaven Upon the Earth

   (No. 3425)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 23, 1866.

   "As the days of Heaven upon the earth." Deuteronomy 11:21.

   As this text was originally written, it referred only to the length of
   life and the length of endurance which God promised to His obedient
   Israel. If they walked in His statutes, the Kingdom was to abide from
   generation to generation, without end, "as the days of Heaven upon
   earth." But it seems to me that such a phrase as this ought to mean
   something more, if it did not, and might be used to express--and must
   be used to express many of those happy seasons which we have enjoyed
   when the Lord has manifested Himself to us--and which have been to us
   "as the days of Heaven upon the earth." But is not the expression
   exaggeration? Is it not too strong? Brothers and Sisters, I think not.
   There were days of Heaven upon earth once. Every day upon earth was a
   day of Heaven before our first parent stretched out his hand and broke
   his Lord's command. When he walked through the Garden of Eden, by the
   side of the rippling Hiddekel, or the streaming Euphrates, which rolled
   over sands of gold. As he reclined under the shadow of the trees from
   the heat of the sun, and plucked the generous fruit, God was with him
   as his Companion and manifested Himself to His favorite creature. Those
   were, indeed, days of Heaven upon earth! There was no strife, no sin,
   no sorrow--everything was happy! It seemed as if this world was but one
   chamber of God's great house, one of the many mansions in our Father's
   house, the vestibule of Glory, the portal of the skies--the ground
   floor, if I may say so, of the Master's palace which reached high up
   beyond the clouds! There were days of Heaven upon earth--and we know
   from the sweetest prophecies, as sure as they are sweet, that there
   will be days of Heaven upon earth again, and that for a continuance! He
   who went up to Heaven from Olivet will so come, in like manner, as we
   have seen Him go up into Heaven! And when He comes, then will He reign
   in the midst of His people. And we are in the habit of speaking of that
   glorious reign with intense delight. No strife shall vex Messiah's
   reign! There shall be no sorrow, then. They shall hang the useless
   helmet in the hall and study war no more--halcyon days! A millennial
   period! Peace like a river! Righteousness like the waves of the sea,
   for He shall live and to Him shall be given of the gold of Sheba!
   Prayer, also, shall be made for Him continually and daily shall He be
   praised! We are looking for the advent of the Lord, praying for it,
   desiring to be found in a working and waiting posture whenever He may
   come! And when He comes, then, to the letter, there shall be a
   long-continued series of days of Heaven upon the earth! But, dear
   Friends, it is of little service to mourn the past, and though it may
   be of much benefit to expect the future, yet what shall we say about
   the present? I think the present is not without some happy seasons
   which may be likened to the days of the text.

   My first business at this time will be to mention some of the days
   which are fit to be called days of Heaven upon the earth Then,
   secondly, I shall answer the question--why do we not have more of them?
   And then, thirdly, I shall try to show the best ways of getting more of
   them. First, then, though man is born to sorrow, yet--

   I. WE HAVE MOST HAPPY AND BLESSED PERIODS--DAYS OF HEAVEN UPON EARTH.
   And the first I will mention is the day in which we first look to Jesus
   and lose our sins. Our Revival Hymnbook sings--

   "Happy day! Happy day! When Jesus washed my sins away." The long time
   of conviction, the dolorous winter of sorrow made the day of our
   release the happier and the brighter, just as the oasis is all the
   greener in contrast with the dry, sandy region over which the traveler
   has passed. The first day of our conversion, when we know Christ and
   have peace through Him, is a peculiarly green and happy spot in our
   life's pilgrimage. We can never forget it. Some of us had a very
   distinct time and place of conversion. To us the day when we looked to
   Jesus is as fresh as though it were newly coined from the mint of time.
   Other days have lost their peculiar image and superscription. We can
   scarcely recollect any one of our birthdays, perhaps, unless something
   very remarkable has happened on them. But that day, if we were to live
   to be as old as Methuselah, we would still remember and count it to be
   the true day of our birth, the day when we truly began to live--for all
   before it was but dead! Dear Friends, do you remember the excessive joy
   of that day? It must have been so with all of you--but with some of us
   the joy was more than we could bear! We were like Simeon, when he saw
   the Lord and said, "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace." We
   made no stipulations with God. We would have been content to rot in a
   dungeon, or to lie tossing on the sick bed of a hospital, now that we
   had found Christ! We needed nothing beyond! We could have dared the
   very gates of Hell in that day to stop our joy! Satan, himself, could
   not have made us cease from singing, so joyous were we. Probably others
   noticed it and asked why it was--and they learned that the Lord had
   done great things for us, whereof we were glad. Oh, I wish this evening
   some of you could find the Savior! Some of you, perhaps, did not come
   here to find Him, but you want Him. You are feeling your sins, perhaps,
   pressing heavily upon you. Your guilt is like a burden upon your
   back--I do hope you will look to the Cross of Christ, for if you do,
   the strings will crack that bind your burden to your back and you shall
   leap for joy to find that you are free! There is life for a look at the
   Crucified One! And with that life there comes such a flood of joy that
   I would not wonder if you were almost ready, when you get home, to
   begin singing in the house even though there might be some there who
   could not sympathize with your joy! It is one of the days of Heaven
   upon earth when a soul casts its anchor upon Christ and says, "I am at
   rest, at rest forever!"

   It must not be thought, however, that this is the only season, for
   often--very often--days of calm and peace are, to the Christian, like
   days of Heaven upon earth! Have you not often felt a stillness in your
   souls--cares gone, doubts fled, troubles forgotten--all so peaceful
   within that you did not seem to have a wish, nor a need and, happy in
   the Savior's love, you did not care for all the world beside? You have
   got up in the morning and you have felt so happy--there was no
   excitement, no exuberance of feeling--but still, such a peaceful
   happiness that you would not have changed your state with the King upon
   his throne! You had to go to business and there was a good deal to try
   you, but you were not vexed. You seemed to put it all aside and to go
   through the day talking with Christ, your hands busy below, but your
   heart occupied above--your treasure being in Heaven and your heart
   being there, too--and that continued all day! And, perhaps, at night,
   at the family altar, they noticed how sweetly you prayed, and, if they
   did not, you remember what a calm there was upon you when you went
   upstairs and cast yourself upon the bed and slept. And if you awoke
   during the night, you found that you were still with God! With some of
   us there have been many such periods--and they have lasted sometimes by
   the week together! But far oftener they have come and gone very soon.
   And to many they have been like angels' visits--few and far
   between--yet have we had enough of them to make us have a foretaste of
   that happier shore where all is forever peace, where the dove builds
   her nest and is never disturbed, where not a wave of trouble ever rolls
   across a sea of everlasting rest, where the angels continually sing the
   praises of God and there are no groans to mar the melody of their
   seraphic songs! Yes, those days of quiet peacefulness were as days of
   Heaven upon earth!

   And we have got beyond that. Many Christians can remember days of
   praise. Have you not had days in which your souls seemed taken up with
   singing God's praises? I do not mean that you went into the street or
   in public, but your soul kept singing--you had got the prayer
   answered--

   "Oh, may my soul in tune be found, Like David's harp of solemn sound!"
   You wanted to tell everybody about what your God had done for you! And
   when you had an opportunity, you told of the goodness of the Lord and
   bade people to, "Taste and see that the Lord is good." You went to see
   the sick, and if they murmured, you put aside their murmuring, for you,
   yourself, felt so happy that you could scarcely sympathize with a
   murmuring spirit! And when you went up to the assembly of God's House
   and they sang some of their joyous songs, when, like a peal of thunder,
   their notes of praise went up and made the walls ring again, oh, how
   blessed were you! Why, I say it without exaggeration, I have sometimes,
   in this House, when we have been singing some of God's praises, felt as
   though it could not be much better to be in Heaven than it was to be in
   the midst of God's people singing with all their hearts His praises! We
   have sometimes run up the gamut until we reached the top of the scale
   and seemed to have almost got to the top of Jacob's ladder--and almost
   ready to step into Heaven! Blessed days of praise! We can never forget
   you,for you have been "as the days of Heaven upon the earth." Days of
   finding Christ, days of peace, days of praise are "as the days of
   Heaven upon the earth."

   Among the choicest seasons in a Christian's life, however, are those in
   which he finds himself honored of God in the conversion of souls. Those
   are days of Heaven upon earth! I would like to know, but I suppose it
   is impossible to find out--I would like to know how many of us, here,
   who are Christians, are spiritual parents. I am afraid if there was a
   stocktaking, there would not be found many diligent ones among us--and
   that is not to our credit. Every Christian should make it to be one of
   the grand aims of his life, if not the grandest, to bring others to
   reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ! Now, as some of you may
   never have tried this, I would like to encourage you by offering you
   the sweet reward which God gives to those who labor for Him. Ah, my
   dear Friend, the City Missionary, you need not tell me of all your
   toils among the poor, the ragged and the filthy--true every word--but
   there is one thing I would like you to tell me. When you have met with
   a poor sinner who has been plucked by you from the depths of
   degradation and you have seen the tears of gratitude glistening in the
   eyes of a convert, have not you felt that it has made up for it all?
   You are no true missionary if you cannot say that! And do not tell me,
   my dear Brother minister, of all the toils of preaching to a people who
   seem weary of hearing--and of endeavoring to convince those of the
   Truth of God who do not care to listen to it--we know all about that!
   But let me ask you, when you have heard that a penitent has come to
   Christ and it has been said, "Behold he prays!" have not you felt that
   you have been rewarded for ten times more toil and trouble than you
   have ever put forth? If one could be cut in pieces and every piece
   could be hanged or flayed alive, it were worthwhile to suffer all that
   for the bringing of one soul to Christ--because if Jesus Christ thought
   it worth His while to suffer unutterable pains to redeem a soul--it
   would be worth the while of any one of Christ's people to suffer the
   same--if that were the way to bring sinners to Him! Let me tell you
   that there is no joy like it! When you can hear a penitent say,
   "Blessed be God, I was once far from Him by wicked works, but I
   listened to the Truth of God as you proclaimed it. I heard your prayer
   in the class and it touched my heart--it broke me down and afterwards
   it led me out of darkness into Christ's marvelous light--and blessed be
   God, I am saved!" Oh, there is no joy like it, and he that has many
   souls thus given to him for his hire must enjoy many of the days of
   Heaven upon earth!

   Again, I believe there is many a family where this same joy has been
   felt--not by those who were the immediate instruments of conversion,
   but by those who have long prayed for the conversion of such. Your good
   mother, now, John, if you were to go home tonight a saved soul, would
   be made unspeakably happy! The dear old soul has been praying for you
   these many years. She wept over you when you were in your cradle. She
   has often prayed for you when you have been cursing and swearing--and
   has she, sometimes, fears that she will go to her grave and never see
   her child brought in? But if she were to hear that you were saved,
   there would be a day of Heaven upon earth in that family! How many
   households are there where the conversion of the husband has turned a
   little Hell into a little Heaven? You know how children are afraid of
   the father--how they run upstairs to get to bed because the father
   comes home the worse for drink--and how the poor mother suffers. There
   may be a little furniture, but she knows at any moment it may go off to
   the pawnbrokers to be converted into money to get more of the accursed
   liquor! And she lives in perpetual bondage and fear! But one night he
   comes home very thoughtful--where has he been? Oh, he has been to
   such-and-such a place of worship! Do you know the woman cannot sleep
   that night for hope? She is in hopes that there may be a change come
   over him-- and when she sees him washing himself the next morning, and
   she hears that he is going back to the same place--how her heart beats
   with joy and hope and how heartily does she pray that her husband may
   become a changed character! And when he comes home and sits down, and
   the tears begin to flow, and he says, "Wife, we never prayed together.
   You know that I could never bear the thoughts of your praying. But it
   is all changed, now--get the Bible and let us see if we cannot pray
   together tonight." That is one of the days of Heaven upon earth! There
   is joy to the mother who finds her son saved, joy to the wife who sees
   her husband converted--and it is equal joy to the husband when he gets
   his wife converted! There are some husbands who have sore trouble with
   ungodly wives. And they have prayed often and I hope they will not grow
   cast-down and leave off praying. The Lord who blessed them can bless
   their wives! Wait, never give in, never give up praying, as long as
   they have breath in their bodies, as long as they are on praying
   ground, pray for them and they may be converted! Then there will be
   joy, unspeakable joy and full of glory even on earth, when such an one
   is brought to know the Lord! These are, indeed, days of Heaven upon
   earth!

   I think the Church has sometimes had them. Some of you do not know much
   about it--you do not work for Christ, you do not pray for souls--you do
   not feel for souls. But I could pick out in this assembly, if it were
   right, some who know a great deal about it because the Lord has given
   them a yearning heart and a tender soul so that they weep for others'
   sorrows and repent of others' sins. These are the persons that know, in
   deed and in truth, that there are days of Heaven upon earth! They
   travail and, therefore, they know the joy of her who forgets her
   travail because a man-child is born into the world!

   But I must hasten on. There are other days. Dear Friends, a communion
   with loving, Christian Brother and Sisters often brings days of Heaven
   upon earth. I know some churches where there seem to be as many sects
   in the church as there are male members--where there is no love, no
   unity, no affection, no contention for the faith--but much contention
   for power and position! Now they never have days of Heaven upon earth.
   But where Christians love each other, there is the dew of Heaven! Some
   Christians greatly envy you, your privileges, and in belonging to a
   united Church. Scores of times, when I have received members who have
   been united before with churches split up and divided, they have said--

   "Here would I find a settled rest, While others go and come! No more a
   stranger or a guest, But like a child at home."

   And I know there are many of you who have found a settled rest here and
   you have found, in communion with God's people, that you are made to
   lie down in green pastures and go beside the still waters. Lonely
   Christians lose much comfort and I think those Christians who are
   always going abroad for company lose more. But those who have a select
   few whom they love, and with whom they associate, and with whom they
   can enjoy holy communion, will find many such days. I must confess that
   I have often been loath to go to bed when I have had a few beloved
   friends to talk about better things--and I am afraid if we had had our
   way and had not had to go to work the next morning, we would have let
   the clock get into the small hours, for so sweet was the company and
   the talk, we did not like to part! When Jesus Christ is the theme,
   there is no fear of weariness! And when those who know Him speak about
   Him, there is such freshness in their speech that one likes to let them
   go on without stopping them at all. Christian fellowship, how sweet!
   And if you get into a Christian family and live in it, how happy and
   pleasant it is! Some families have a morose father who seems to think
   there is no one in the world to be cared for except himself--and he
   domineers and is a tyrant. Others have a touchy, crotchety,
   quick-tempered mother and very little can go right with them long
   together. Others have a negligent woman, perhaps untidy, who does not
   attend to the house, but is a gossip. Now, to live in such houses as
   those is a misery, but if you get into some houses such as I have
   known, where the father endeavors, while he rules the house, to do it
   with love, where the mother is the very pattern of her sex, where the
   children are obedient and yet happy and free--where the servants feel
   an interest in the master's affairs, because the master feels an
   interest in theirs--it is like a little Heaven upon earth! It is a
   blessed thing to drop into such a house, for you feel there, indeed,
   they have days of Heaven upon earth! When you young people marry, I
   hope you will set up just such houses and that it will be your desire
   to make your homes such that people may like to live in them. I would
   have your houses like that of Sir Thomas Abney, where Dr. Watts went to
   stay a few days--and stayed 26 years! It was too good a house to leave!
   Let your houses be such that when good men come, they will feel, "Here
   is the place where we can find rest." May you have many days of Heaven
   upon earth in such a way!

   Now, to pass on, surely the highest of all will be found in a close
   communion with Christ. There is a nearness of approach to Christ of
   which to speak in the carnal ear would be to cast pearls before swine.
   There is a secret and mysterious conversation carried on between earth
   and Heaven of which Solomon sang in mystic numbers in the
   Canticles--and which saints have enjoyed, but which no tongue can
   adequately express--a peace which is not only like Heaven, but is
   Heaven! It is a piece of Heaven cast down to us here! It is not a grape
   from some wilderness vine, but a cluster from the vine of Eshcol and
   Eshcol was in Canaan, itself. The Lord gives earnests of His love,
   pledges of joys to come, so that even here we have, in communion with
   Christ, days of Heaven upon earth! But I must not prolong the catalog,
   for time fails me. I think I have said enough to make some feel that
   the Christian's life is a happy one--let me add my testimony that it
   is! Let me add, not mine, but the testimony even of many a Negro slave
   in the days of slavery, who could say that, notwithstanding all
   suffering and all penury and every ill, a Christian's life was a happy
   one, after all. Now, the second point was to be an enquiry, if there
   are so many days of Heaven upon earth--

   II. WHY DO WE NOT HAVE MORE OF THEM?

   I think there are many reasons. Some people think it wicked to be
   happy. You smile, but I know some Christians who even seem to think
   that it is a sign of growth in Grace when you grow to be blessedly
   miserable! They imagine that for anything like joy to be in a Christian
   is incompatible with sincerity. We have not so learned Christ! We know
   that through much tribulation we inherit the Kingdom of God, but we
   have learned that as tribulation abounds, so consolation abounds
   through Jesus Christ. Let your face lack no oil and your head no
   ointment--go your way and live happily and joyfully--for if God has
   accepted you, there is no flesh living that has such a right to be
   joyous! Accepted in the Beloved! Cleansed from sin! Clothed with the
   righteousness of Christ! Safe for Heaven! Why should you not be happy?
   Go to the weeping willows, take down your harps and begin to strike
   them to melodious tunes. You ought to be happy, you people of the
   living God! Let the righteous be glad. Yes, let them shout for joy!
   Some Christians, perhaps, do not think it is wrong to be happy, but
   they will not be. Almost as a matter of principle, they will not be
   happy. You cannot please them. They are thorough Englishmen--they
   exercise the blessed prerogative of grumbling. No matter what it is,
   they can always see something or other to find fault with in it. If
   they have much, it might be more. If they have little, they are harshly
   treated. The blessings of the upper springs cannot content them unless
   the nether springs flow in as freely. And the mercies that come from
   Heaven will not please them unless they can have their share of the
   mercies of earth. Oh, dear Friends, pray the Lord to give you a new
   heart and a right spirit! I cannot make out what such a body as you
   will do in Heaven. Ask your Master to take away your grumpy spirit so
   that you may be able to see reasons for joy, for there are many of
   them! Charnock says, "He who observes Providence will never be without
   Providence to observe," and we can say, he who is willing to be made
   happy may never be without something to make him happy, if he chooses
   to look for it.

   There are some of us who do not have as many days of Heaven upon earth
   because we could hardly bear them. Joy has sometimes danger with it.
   There are, among the flowers, poisonous asps. The Christian has need,
   when his cup is full, to carry it with a steady hand. Too much
   spiritual joy might even be too much for the physical frame, like the
   old Scotch Divine who called out, "Hold, Lord! Hold, Lord! It is
   enough! Remember I am but an earthen vessel. Give me no more joy, lest
   I die of excess of it!" Yes, there might be spiritual maladies, if not
   bodily ones--we might grow proud, self-conceited and lifted up. If we
   have much sail, we need much ballast and, perhaps, the furnace is as
   good a place for us as any place on earth until we get to Heaven. If we
   had so many of these days of Heaven upon earth, we might never long to
   go to Heaven at all, we might say, "This is a place happy enough for
   us!" But the Lord will not let us do so. He will make the wilderness to
   be a wilderness, still, that we may be willing to go on to Canaan. He
   would not have the sailor so content with the vessel as not to desire
   the port--and so He sends us rough days and stiff breezes that we may
   be disturbed and long for our desired haven. There is one thing
   more--if we had so many of these days and no troubles, we would not be
   like Christ--we would lack one point of conformity to Him, for He was
   "a Man of Sorrows." We are to have fellowship with Him in His
   sufferings--and if our path were always smooth and our sky always
   bright--we might not know as well as we now know what the sufferings of
   Jesus Christ meant. We might be losers in Heaven if we were not
   sufferers here, for I suppose it will be a part of the joy in Heaven to
   remember the sorrow through which we came, to recollect the
   difficulties which we overcame and if we have not sorrows or
   difficulties, we shall not have so sweet a song. Rest is all the
   sweeter to the laboring man, and so shall the rest of Heaven be all the
   better because of the days of grief and sorrow which we had on earth.
   But now, lastly--

   III. WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET MORE OF THE DAYS OF HEAVEN UPON EARTH?

   Well, we cannot build a city with streets of gold. We cannot find
   chrysolytes and pearls with which to build a Jerusalem the Golden! We
   must take the place as we find it. And this world of ours, though a
   very fair earth, is not all we should like it to be--but we cannot
   alter it. It is very much like a convict settlement, a prison house to
   Christians. This is not our rest and, as we look abroad upon it, we
   feel it is not a proper place for the spirit to dwell in. It needs a
   better land in which to develop itself. But how, then, are we to get
   Heaven upon earth? I think there are three things we can do. The first
   is, we can get it, if we cannot alter the place, by being more like the
   spirits in Heaven. They are happy in Heaven, not only because it is
   Heaven, but because they are heavenly! They could not be otherwise than
   happy. If those blessed spirits were on earth, so perfectly pure as
   they are, they would be perfectly happy. It is not, I say, so much the
   place that makes their Heaven, as their state of mind. They are
   completely conformed to the will of God. They delight themselves
   intensely in the Most High. They have been freed from their earthly
   grossness and they are now like the pure gold that has passed through
   the furnace. Let us pray for holiness and we shall get happiness! Let
   us ask to be heavenly-minded and we shall get Heaven! There is no fear
   about our joy if we can get holiness. Very much in proportion as we
   shall become fit for Heaven shall we have days of Heaven upon earth!

   And then a second thing we can do. If we cannot get the place, we can
   get the objective that makes the place such a place as it is--that is
   to say, if we cannot get Heaven, we can get days of Heaven upon earth
   by getting Christ, for it is Christ who makes Heaven, as the sun makes
   the day! Christ is the flower in that garden that makes all the rest
   sweet! Christ is Heaven's crown and glory, it's brightest jewel and
   diadem--and he that gets his heart set upon Christ gets the better part
   of Heaven! At any rate, he can do without the angels and without the
   harps of gold for a time. When he gets Christ in his heart, the hope of
   glory--when the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy
   Spirit--and he can say, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His," he has got
   the major part of Heaven and may have days of Heaven upon earth!

   There is a third thing that we can do to get Heaven, and that is to
   follow the occupation of those who are in Heaven. A man's joy or sorrow
   comes very much from what he has to do. In Heaven they are always
   serving and praising. If we get the same work to do, if we enter into
   the same happy choir and sing praises to our heavenly King, and try to
   serve Him without weariness, why, then, we shall get, again, the better
   part of Heaven by getting the occupation of it! Holy men with Christ in
   their hearts, and with Christ's work in their hands, spend many days of
   Heaven upon earth! We did not find Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Wesley very
   often troubled with doubts and fears--and I believe the reason was
   because their tenor of life was on high, their communion with Jesus was
   very close and, above all, because they were so hard at work for their
   Master that they had not time to sit down and begin raking in the mire
   of doubts and fears! May we be just such men as they were--and we shall
   have days of Heaven upon earth!

   Now, alas, alas, alas, there are many to whom I am now speaking who
   will have no days of Heaven upon earth, but they will have their poor
   unsatisfactory days to drag their weary length along and then, at last,
   will come the days of death. Ah, then, there are some that have had
   days of Hell upon earth--some who have made the nurse declare that they
   would never nurse such a man, again, for all the world--some who have
   made their very parents start from their bedside to hear their cries as
   they lay there suffering from the rod of Almighty wrath! Take care,
   take care that such is not your end! And if you would escape from it,
   remember the door of Heaven is Christ! The door is wide open! Only come
   to it, trust Christ, and you shall have days of Heaven upon earth, and
   afterwards Heaven, itself, shall be your portion! God grant that it
   shall be so for His name's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: DEUTERONOMY 6:1-23.

   Verses 1, 2. Now these are the commandments, the statues, and the
   judgments which the LORD, your God, commanded to teach you, that you
   might do them in the land where you go to possess it That you might
   fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments
   which I command'you, you and your son, and your son's son, all the days
   of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. Obedience to God
   should arise from the fear of Him, or from a holy awe of God felt in
   the heart--for all true religion must be heart work. It is not the bare
   action, alone, at which God looks, but at the motive--at the spirit
   which dictates it, hence it is always put, "That you might fear the
   Lord, your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments." Neither
   are we to be content with keeping commands ourselves. It is the duty of
   parents to seek the good of their children--to seek that the son and
   the son's son should walk in the ways of God all their lives. May God
   grant us never to be partakers of the spirit of those who think that
   they have no need to look after the religion of their children--who
   seem as if they left it to a blind fate. May we care for them with this
   care that our son and our son's son should walk before the Lord all the
   days of their life!

   3. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well
   with you and thatyou mayincrease mightily, as the LORD God of your
   fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.
   It seems, according to the Old Covenant, that temporal prosperity was
   appended as a blessing to the keeping of God's commandments. It has
   been sometimes said that while prosperity was the blessing of the Old
   Covenant, adversity is the blessing of the New. There is some truth in
   that statement, for whom the Lord loves, He chastens, and yet is it
   true that the best thing for a man is that he should walk in the
   commands of God. There is a sense in which we do make the best of both
   worlds when we seek thelove of God. When we seek first the Kingdom of
   God and His righteousness, other things are added to us so that it is
   not without meaning to us that the Lord here promises temporal
   blessings to His people.

   4. Hear, OIsrael: The LORD our God is one LORD. This is the great
   Doctrine that we learn, both from the Old and the New Testament--there
   is one Lord. And this great Truth of God has been burnt into the Jews
   by their long chastisement and, whatever other mistakes they make, you
   never find them making a mistake about this! The Lord your God is one
   Lord. May we always be kept from all idolatry--from all worship of
   anything except the living God. The sacred Unity of the Divine Trinity
   may we evermore hold fast.

   5. And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with
   all your soul, and with all your might It is not a little love that God
   deserves, nor is it a little love that He will accept. He blesses us
   with all His heart and all His might--and after that fashion are we to
   love Him.

   6. 7. And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in your
   heart And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and shall
   talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
   and when you lie down, and when you rise up.The Word of God is not for
   some particular place called a Church or a Meeting House. It is for all
   places, all times and all occupations. I wish that we had more of this
   talking over of God's Word when we sit by the way, or when we walk.

   8. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be
   as frontlets between your eyes. With you in all your actions--with you
   in all your thoughts--conspicuously with you--not out of ostentation,
   but through your obedience to become apparent unto all men.

   9-12 And you shall write them upon the posts of your house, and on your
   gates. And it shall be, when the LORD your Godshallhave broughtyou into
   the land which He swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
   Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities which you built not And the
   houses full of all good things which you filled not, and wells dug
   which you dug not, vineyards and olive trees which you planted not,
   when you shall have eaten and are full, then beware lest you forget the
   LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house
   of bondage. Pride is the peculiar sin of prosperity--and pride stands
   side by side with forgetfulness of God. Instead of remembering from
   where our mercies came, we begin to thank ourselves for these
   blessings--and God is forgotten. I remember one of whom it was said
   that he was a self-made man and he adored his creator. And I may say
   that there are a great many persons who do just that! They believe that
   they have made themselves and so they worship themselves! Be it ours to
   remember that it is God who gives us strength to get wealth or to get
   position and, therefore, unto Him be all the honor of it, and never let
   Him be forgotten.

   13-15. You shall fear the LORDyour God, andserve Him, and shall swear
   by His name. You shallnot go after other gods or the gods of the people
   which are round about you: (For the LORD your God is a jealous God
   among you). He will have the heart all to Himself. Two gods He cannot
   endure. Of false gods, there may be many--of the true God there can be
   but One--and He is a jealous God.

   15-19. Lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and
   destroy you from off the face of the earth. You shallnot tempt the LORD
   your God as you tempted Him in Massah. You shall diligently keep the
   commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His
   statutes, which He has commanded you. And you shall do that which is
   right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with you
   and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore
   unto your fathers, to cast out all your enemies from before you, as the
   LORD has spoken. Now, this Covenant of Works they break, as we also
   have long ago broken ours. Blessed be God, our salvation now hangs on
   another Covenant which cannot fail nor break down--the Covenant of
   Grace! Yet, still, now that we have become the Lord's children, we are
   put under the discipline of the Lord's house, and these words might not
   set forth what is the discipline of the Lord's house towards His own
   children, namely, that He does bless us when we walk in His ways, and
   that He will walk contrary to us if we walk contrary to Him. He keeps a
   rod in His house, and in very love He uses that upon His best beloved
   ones. "You only have I known of all the nations of the earth;
   therefore, I will punish you for your iniquities." He will not kill His
   children, nor treat them as a judge treats a criminal, for they are not
   under the Law, but under Grace. But He will chasten them and treat them
   as a father chastens his child--out of love. Oh, that we might have
   Grace to walk before Him with a holy, childlike fear, so that we may
   always walk in the light of His Countenance!

   20-23. And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean
   the testimonies, and the statues, and the judgments which the LORD our
   Godhas commanded you? Then you shall say unto your son, We were
   Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a
   mighty hand. And the LORD showed signs and wonders great and sore upon
   Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household before our eyes. And He
   brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the
   land which He swore unto our fathers. And cannot we tell our children
   what God has done for us--how He brought us out of our spiritual
   captivity, and how in His almighty love He has brought us into His
   Church and will surely bring us into the glory above? May God grant us
   Grace to speak about these things without diffidence, but with great
   confidence to tell our children of what He has done.

A Sore Grievance

   (No. 3426)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They have forgotten their resting place." Jeremiah 50:6.

   THE people of Israel had been so hunted about that they forgot the
   place where once they rested. The same remark may be made of some
   congregations. There are Christian people who have the great misfortune
   of an unchristly pastor. The preaching is eloquent--they are constantly
   exhorted to do one thing and another. It may be the preaching is
   intellectual--they are encouraged to speculate upon this and that
   Doctrine, or it may happen that the preaching is rhetorical, the people
   are covered with flowers--the preacher seems to be constantly
   scattering from himself a display of fireworks, an explosion of
   dazzling words! But there is no manifestation of Christ--no opening up
   of the completeness of the atoning Sacrifice--no uplifting of Jesus in
   His love to His people, in His union with them, in the Covenant which
   He has made on their behalf. Oftentimes have we met with good people
   who fretted because the ministry failed to supply for their souls. They
   could have done without the eloquence. They would have been happy
   without the new theories, however intellectual. They could have
   survived if there had been less exhortation--what they wanted was a
   little food to strengthen them, a little repose to invigorate them, a
   little faith to encourage them in resting upon the finished work of
   Jesus Christ! Oh, what an account will they have to give who, instead
   of being shepherds of God's sending to feed His flock with discretion
   and make them lie down in green pastures, come to them as legal
   taskmasters wielding the rod, but never using the pastoral staff to
   guide the flocks by still waters! However, I fear there are some who,
   though no less worried, nevertheless forget their resting place. Let us
   talk familiarly with one another on this theme.

   What is our resting place, Beloved? We have only one answer, I am
   sure--"We who have believed have entered into rest," but our rest is in
   Jesus Christ, Himself. We believed on Him, He took away our burden and
   we found rest. We bowed our neck to His yoke, became His disciples and
   we found yet fuller rest unto our souls. Not a particle of rest do we
   get from ourselves, neither does the world contribute to it, for, "in
   the world you shall have tribulation." All our rest is found in Him,
   for He is our peace, who has said, "It is finished," and in that
   finished work we confidently repose. It is possible for us to forget,
   however, to enjoy the rest which faith has made it our privilege to
   possess. And if we do, it is not only a loss to our comfort, but it is
   a very serious loss to us in all respects. If sheep, under the charge
   of any, should lose their rest, besides the cruelty to the creatures
   and the suffering it would involve them, it would be a serious loss to
   their owner. A sheep does, after it has been fed, lie down--it must
   naturally chew the cud. The food it has gathered, it must digest in
   peace, or else it cannot grow fat. It cannot, in fact, be in health at
   all. Fancy a field of sheep in which some worrying dog constantly
   amused himself by hunting them from end to end! They would become lean
   and valueless. They would ultimately die. We must have rest! It is
   important, therefore, not partly and in measure, but to the uttermost
   degree, that when Christ has become our rest, we should continue to
   enjoy Him and to rest in Him! The sense of such need urges me, at this
   time, to endeavor to lead you, as God shall help me, to Christ Jesus
   our rest, by reminding you of some who forget their resting place. If
   it should happen to come home to your own souls, may you have Grace to
   escape from the calamity which the text describes!

   Three things--here is the first--a sin of which to be convinced.
   Secondly, the cause of it to be sought out. And thirdly, the cure of it
   to be brought about. "They have forgotten their resting place."

   I. THIS IS TO BE ACCOUNTED A SIN FOR MANY REASONS.

   Let us recollect how dearly our resting place was purchased for us. To
   give your soul rest, my Brothers and Sisters, Jesus Christ gave up His
   rest and more--His Heaven, His Throne, His honor, His life. No rest
   could there ever have beenfor you, a wandering sheep, if the Shepherd
   had not given up Himself as a ransom for the flock. Did it cost Him
   Gethse-mane's bloody sweat? Did it cost Him Calvary's wounds and death?
   And did you receive it and yet forget it? Have not you often thought
   that whatever else might have passed away from your mind, never could
   the thought of that dying love depart? Yet it has faded on the tablet
   of your heat, for you have forgotten the priceless gift which that
   dying love has procured for you! Oh, chide yourself, that Immanuel's
   purchase should be lightly esteemed, that He, your rest, should ever
   slip away from your thoughts!

   Remember, too, how graciously that rest was given to you. My own
   remembrances may help yours. I remember well--and did I live to twice
   the age of Methuselah--I could never forget the time of my wearisome
   bondage under the Law and under the slavery of sin! Oh, what I would
   have given, then, to have had rest, to have had my sins pardoned. I
   dare to say, I think a thousand deaths would have been cheaply endured
   by me if I might have escaped the wrath to come! My burdened soul chose
   strangling rather than life because my life had become weariness and
   even like unto wormwood and gall had the cup of life been embittered.
   But as in a moment, rest came to my soul by a glance at that Crucified
   Savior! An act of simple faith exercised upon Christ's Atonement
   brought me perfect rest! And shall I forget my resting place? I am sure
   if some prophetic spirit of the future could have whispered in my ear
   at the time of my conversion, "You will forget your resting place," I
   would quickly have answered, with Hazael, to the Prophet, "Is your
   servant a dog, that he should do this thing?" And I might have said,
   "Is your servant a devil, that he should ever think of doing such a
   thing?" "Love so amazing, so Divine"--shall this be cast behind my
   back? A gift so precious, brought to me when I deserved it not and just
   when I most required it--shall it ever be lightly esteemed or
   carelessly neglected? Oh, memory, let fall what you may, but retain as
   with an iron grasp, the recollection of that blessed day in which my
   soul found her resting place!

   Beloved, there are other reasons to make this forgetfulness of ours
   greatly sinful. Rememberhowsweetly we have enjoyed that rest since
   then! It was not one day a honeymoon and then ever afterwards Christ
   and our souls, strangers-- oh, no, I speak to some of you who have had
   many high days and holidays since the time of your conversion! You have
   feasted upon dying love! That banqueting house of Solomon's Song is a
   place well known to you--the banner of love that waved over the spouse
   of old--its silken folds have also waved over you! 'Twas but the other
   night when some of us were together in prayer and communion with
   Christ, and we could not help singing--

   "My willing soul would stay,

   In such a frame as this,

   And sit and sing herself away,

   To everlasting bliss."

   Could we have such enjoyments and yet forget them? Such rest in the
   resting place and yet make light of it? Such peace of God that passes
   all understanding, and yet be listless about it? Wretch that I am to
   wander thus in search of vain delights, to leave the flowing fountain
   for the broken cisterns, which, if they had been whole, had been but
   stagnant reservoirs, unworthy to be compared to the clear living stream
   that bursts from the fountain of fellowship with Christ! Let every
   sweet season of past spiritual enjoyment gently rebuke you, Beloved, if
   you do at all forget your resting place!

   Further, does it not seem strange and marvelous that any of us should
   forget our resting place when we so greatly need it? Oh, I think I
   speak for the most of you when I say it is a weary world after all the
   mercy that God has made to pass before us--it is a weary, weary world!
   Solomon, with all his wealth, with all the accessories of pleasure,
   with all the tastes to enjoy them, deliberately said, "Vanity of
   vanities; all is vanity." And I am sure it is easy amidst pains and
   toils, blunders and disappointments, for many of us to utter the same
   lament. When afflicted in body, distressed with severe labor, or
   reduced to poverty, we might as well try to find rest on the sea, or on
   a bed of thorns, or on a bed of flames, as find rest in the things of
   this world! What weariness of the flesh, what vexation of spirit we
   endure! Oh, then, why is it we forget our resting place? Men, jaded and
   faint with the drudgery of labor, are glad to throw themselves upon the
   bed and fall asleep, and you that have much toil and travail under the
   sun, will you forget that couch that Christ has brought you, upon which
   your spirits may take delicious repose? With such need for rest, and
   such a rest so sweetly proven to be restful in the past, 'tis strange,
   'tis passing strange, 'tis amazing that we should ever forget our
   resting place!

   Since our resting place is so suitable to us, it becomes the more
   strange that we should forget it. Suitable for a sinner is a finished
   salvation. Suitable for a warrior is the great shield that covers his
   head in the day of battle. Suitable for a fugitive is that castle and
   high tower of our defense which is found in Christ, the Lord's
   Anointed! "The coney goes toher place in the rocks and the stork has
   her nest among the fir trees." Oh, you children of God, you have a
   resting place suitable to your nature--how is it you can forget it?
   Touch upon the things of nature, how they chide you! Bring to your
   remembrance the birds of the air, the beasts of the forest, the dumb
   driven cattle accustomed to the yoke, and let them chide you, for they
   forget not their resting place! Carried away to the city the other day,
   the dove was taken from its cage, and they let it loose, fastening to
   it a message. It mounted aloft, it whirled round a while that it might
   see where it was. It was far, far away from the dovecot--it was found
   hundreds of miles away, but where did it fly? Swift as an arrow from
   the bow, it sought its resting place with infallibility of affection!
   It found its nearest way to the cot where it had been reared and
   brought its message safely there. Will you let the pigeon outstrip you
   in affection for your resting place? Look at the swift-winged dove and
   be ashamed! And even the dog, which you despise, taken away from its
   master, carried many miles away, in darkness, too, so that it might not
   know its way, has been known to swim rivers, cross by-ways it could not
   have known, and there it is found barking for admission at its master's
   door--oh, so happy when it heard its master's voice again! It could not
   rest elsewhere. Oh, my Heart, are you more doggish than a dog? Do you
   forget your Lord when dogs remember well their masters? Let us learn
   even from these creatures, I say, and henceforth let us not forget our
   resting place. As all ingratitude is base, this sin cannot be light or
   venial. Now, let us ask--

   II. WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE FORGETFULNESS which we sometimes have of
   Jesus Christ--our heart's dear rest?

   How frequently it arises from neglect of thought, a culpable
   remissness! So busy, up in the morning and at it--the whirl, the noise
   and clatter of business in the ears--always in the ears, every nerve on
   the strain, right on till one falls asleep through sheer exhaustion!
   Oh, our times are hard for deep piety! They are hard and trying times
   for souls that would walk near to Christ. I know more Grace can match
   the evil of the times, but still, our Puritan forefathers with their
   quiet lives, calm and undistracted, with the time they could have for
   studying the Word of God, and for private prayer--no wonder they
   outstripped us! I am afraid some Christians neglect the reading of the
   Word of God--almost as a rule forget it! You don't get your daily text.
   You don't get your meditation. Ah, Souls, if a thing never comes across
   the mind, it is not remarkable that you should forget it! If any of you
   are going on a journey, you don't forget your wives! No, they come
   often across your thoughts. You may forget some stranger whom you saw
   but once--you may never think of him again. Were the mind more occupied
   with Christ, there would be less likelihood of our forgetting Him! You
   know, when the photographer takes a picture, if he does it rapidly, it
   may be that, by-and-by, it will fade. If they want to take a picture
   that shall be definite, fixed and permanent, they let the sensitive
   plate continue long exposed to the view, that there may be a good,
   thoroughly well-fixed impression. I would that my soul had many
   opportunities of being like a sensitive plate fixed right in front of
   Jesus to take His portrait thoroughly--to have it so upon my soul that
   it could never fade away! Oh, to have much more communion with Christ,
   to contemplate Him with a steady gaze and undi-stracted attention is
   the way to overcome our present forgetfulness! This is a flimsy age--a
   superficial age. It has its waves of religious excitement, but they are
   all on the surface. We have not many of those great ground-swell waves
   where the ocean of manhood seems to heave up from the very bottom.
   These are the waves that work wonders for men and glorify God. May we
   have many such in our own souls!

   Another reason why we forget our Savior is our tendency to
   self-sufficiency. A poor man who has nothing of his own and who lives
   day-by-day a pensioner upon some rich man's bounty, cannot forget the
   man who helps him! But if he should forget him this morning, he will be
   sure to remember him tomorrow morning when he needs bread! And he who
   receives his money weekly, might forget his friend on the Tuesday, but
   he will remember him again on the Saturday, when he must go to him
   again! If we were always sensible as we should be of our absolute
   dependence on Christ for everything, and going to Him for all, there
   would be no fear of our memories failing us! But we very soon set up a
   little independency of our own--poor worms as we are--as a Brother said
   in prayer the other night, "Dust heaps!" That is all we are, the very
   best of us--poor "dust heaps." We imagine we are kingdoms and we talk
   such great things, and think such big things about our experience and
   our wisdom! Oh, away with it all! We might well not see the sun when we
   eclipse him with our self-sufficiency! You poor beggarly worm, naked,
   poor, and miserable, I counsel you to buy of Christ, gold tried in the
   fire, that you may be rich! And white raiment that you may be clothed!
   And go to Him again, leaving your self-sufficiency behind you!

   With others it is worldliness that keeps them from remembering their
   dear Savior. They forget their resting place because they are so
   worldly, grasping after so much. Enough is not enough to them--they
   must have more. The early rising and the sitting up late are right
   enough for industry, but wrong enough for avarice--these are the things
   that keep the soul from Christ--the getting money rightly if you can,
   but, anyway, the getting of money. A man cannot live for money and yet
   abide in Christ! When the heart gets the world into it, it eats as does
   a canker. If you will have the world, you shall have it--but you shall
   not have Christ! Oh, can you make an exchange of Christ for such poor
   stuff, for such heavy clay? Keep all the world outside your heart! If
   you keep all the sea outside the ship, it cannot sink. Is the world
   inside your heart--a little water there will prove a leak that will
   sink your vessel--beware of worldliness! Those of you can be worldly
   that are poor, as well as those that are rich. You may have cares that
   worry and devour--and keep you from your Savior. Strive against these!
   Be not cankered with this canker! Love not the world, or you cannot
   walk with Jesus! Lay your cares on Him who cares for you--and you will
   come back to your resting place!

   I fear that some Christians forget their resting place through
   idolatry. "Idolatry?" you ask, "We are not idolaters! We are not, even
   as the Romanists are, who will worship their crucifixes or their
   relics." No idolatry? Was not that idolatry this afternoon with that
   boy of yours? Ah, what a boy! Your heart all but adores him and if he
   were taken from you, you would feel you could not forgive God! No
   idolatry? The other day, when you looked upon your fair estate and all
   the comforts of life with which God had surrounded you, did not you
   feel your heart go after these things? No idolatry? "Little children,
   keep yourselves from idols," was once an exhortation of John, and it is
   also my exhortation to you this evening. We so soon make idols. I am
   afraid if an idol breaking were to take place tonight, many of you
   would go home broken-hearted! Or if your idols are at home, you would
   go home to see them broken, and yourself be ready to despair. There is
   much idolatry--and if you love son or daughter more than Christ, you
   are not worthy of Him! If you love husband or wife more than Christ,
   you are not worthy of Him. Oh, be it so, that they take low seats and
   Christ sits on the Throne! Go down, Beloved, go down! I love you there
   as I may and should, but come up, my Savior, take the highest place,
   for there You must sit King of Kings and Lord of Lords!

   Once more, I think some genuine Christians forget their resting place
   for a while through despondency of spirit. It is sometimes hard to
   remember our sweet rest in Jesus when we get oppressed. I can speak
   very feelingly here. There are some of us that carry about with us a
   constitution which elevates us, at times, up to the very heavens of
   delight--and sinks us down at other periods very, very low. Those who
   have high tides must expect to have very dry ebbs. If you mount high,
   you sometimes will fall low and then, when the liver won't act, when
   the spirits won't move, when the whole heart hangs its harp upon the
   willows, it is difficult, then, to come and rest in Jesus. And some
   feel grinding trouble, or a perpetual affliction of body, till at last
   they get into a chronic state of sadness. Dear Brother, dear Sister,
   before you get there, make a rally, if you can, to get away from it! It
   is to be escaped from. After all, Christ died for sinners such as you
   are. Hang on Him! Cling to Him! Come and wash again in the fountain
   which is filled with His blood! He loves you! He gives Himself for you!
   He can never forget you, or cast you away! Come and rejoice in Him, yet
   again, and lift up your heart once more by simple, confident faith in
   Him, for, "He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God
   by Him." Don't let Satan triumph! Don't let the world laugh because a
   Christian is in despair! "Return unto your rest, O my soul, for the
   Lord has dealt bountifully with you." Be gone, you fears! Let the winds
   take them away. "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him. His mercy
   is not clean gone forever. He will be mindful of His Covenant. He will
   not cast away His people whom He did foreknow."

   These are the things that will sometimes bring us into the dilemma of
   forgetting our resting place. And now to close--

   III. WHAT IS THE CURE FOR IT ALL?

   I do not know what Charles the First meant when he gave his watch to
   Bishop Judson and said, "Remember." I do not care what he meant. But
   let the same be my word to you tonight, "Remember! Remember!" That is
   the cure for this distemper of the mind, this dereliction of the
   heart."Remember what?" you ask. Remember first the past--

   "His love in time past forbids me to think

   He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink.

   Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review,

   Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through."

   Remember the days of old, the Everlasting Covenant. Remember the
   sealing of the Covenant with blood upon the accursed tree. Remember the
   day of your sin, and the day of salvation--your sore bondage and your
   great deliverance when He brought you out of Egypt with a high hand and
   an outstretched arm--remember this and you will no more forget your
   resting place!

   Remember again the future. You ask, "Can we remember that which has not
   happened yet?" Let your faith substantiate the promise and see it as
   though fulfilled, and remember it tonight. You will, before long, be
   where Jesus is. Your soul, white-robed, shall appear before Him, and
   your poor body--vile body as it is--shall be fashioned like unto His
   glorious body, and you shall shine with the mighty host who day without
   night magnify the name of Him that is, and was, and is to come!
   Remember this, and you shall not forget your resting place. "All this
   comes to you through Him. He has procured it for you and is preparing
   it for you at this hour."

   Remember, also, something about the present What is there that you
   have, tonight, of all your possessions that can afford you rest? Have
   the roots of your spirit begun to twist about the earth? Pray to have
   them unbound, for, otherwise a painful time will come to you. What have
   you that you could rest upon in the time of death? A Roman Catholic
   once said that the Doctrine of Justification by Faith was a blessed
   supper Doctrine--would do to end the day with! But he thought it was a
   bad breakfast Doctrine to begin the day with. At least there is truth
   in the first observation--it is a blessed supper Doctrine and Christ
   makes a blessed supper for us in life's end. There is no supper in
   life's end--no supper that the soul can eat--but Jesus Christ, who
   shall give her satisfaction and contentment as she goes forth on her
   long journey! Well, as you have nothing that can satisfy you in dying,
   why do you try to satisfy yourself with it now? Have you been making an
   idol? Have you? Let it go! Forget not your resting place, I pray you.
   Look at your friend's house and read, "mortal" written there! Look in
   your child's face and know that before long your last act of kindness
   for that child will be to find a narrow home in the silent grave. What?
   Are you immortal and seeking to live upon mortal food? You, eternal as
   God's life, and yet seeking to satisfy yourself with the worm's meat
   that springs out of earth, and goes back again to it! Shame on you!
   When Christ gives you rest, and is All-in-All to you, turn not away
   from the everything to try and fill yourself with the nothing!

   Lastly remember, and this last remembrance will be a blessed
   cure--remember Christ Himself. For this purpose come to His Table.
   Though you have, for a while, forgotten your resting place, He says,
   "This do you in remembrance of Me." Come and remember Him again--

   "Gethsemane can I forget? Or there Your conflict see? Your agony and
   bloody sweat, And not remember Thee? When to the Cross I turn my eyes,
   And rest on Calvary,

   Lamb of God, my Sacrifice,

   1 must, I must remember Thee."

   So may it be with you now!

   There may be, however, in this congregation--no, I know there are some
   who have never yet enjoyed rest. They are going about to find it. Dear
   Hearer, there is only one resting place--don't look for another! Your
   works will never provide you rest. Sacraments can never rest you. Tears
   and groans, and prayers can never rest you. "None but Jesus can do
   helpless sinners good." "Believe in Him and live!" Trust in Him and you
   shall find rest unto your soul forever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JEREMIAH 3:6-25; 4:1-29.

   Let us read part of the 3rd Chapter of Jeremiah where God brings a
   solemn accusation against the two nations of Israel and Judah because
   they forsook the living God and went after idols--neglected His pure
   and holy worship--and followed after the abominable rites of the
   heathen.

   Verse 6, 7. The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,
   Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She is gone up
   upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has
   played the harlot Yet I said, after she had done all these things, Turn
   you unto Me. Depth of mercy that God should bid such a polluted one
   return to Him! "Yet I said, after she had done all these things, Turn
   you unto Me."

   7, 8. But she returnednot. Andher treacherous sister Judah saw it
   AndIsaw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed
   adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce. Yet her
   treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot
   also. Some cannot be kept back from sin by the punishment of others,
   but they run into the fire in which others have been burnt, and so they
   aggravate their sin.

   9. And it came to past through the lightness of her whoredom that she
   defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with wood.That
   is to say, she gave her heart to false gods and worshipped stones and
   wood. And how it must anger the living God to see men turn away from
   Him to worship blocks of wood and stone, instead of Him, and especially
   a people who have been instructed concerning the living God, and so
   commit the grossest act of disloyalty to Him, and are rebellious to the
   last degree.

   10, 11. And for this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto
   Me with her whole heart, but feignedly says the LORD. And the LORD said
   unto me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than
   treacherous Judah. The one sinned openly and persevered in it. The
   other pretended to repent and did not, and that pretended repentance
   was more hateful in the sight of God than even the daring and open sin
   of Israel. What next?

   12. Go and proclaim these words towards the north and say, Return, you
   backsliding Israel, says the LORD. And I willnot cause My anger to fall
   upon you: for I am merciful, says the LORD, andI will not stay angry
   forever The offense was foul. It is such a one as stabs at the heart of
   man's honor. It is an offense which a man will scarcely ever forgive.
   But God bids His wandering Israel come back! And He proclaims
   mercy--free mercy--even to such gross transgressors!

   13. Only acknowledge your iniquity. It is all He asks you to do.
   Confess that you have done wrong. "Only acknowledge your iniquity."

   13. That you have transgressed against the Lord, your God, and have
   scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you
   have not obeyed My voice, says the LORD. It was under the trees that
   they set up their altars to worship there false gods, so that they
   turned the graves, which should be full of beauty and sweet with song,
   into the places of idolatry, whereby God was provoked. But He says,
   "Only confess it. Come and lament it. Acknowledge that you have been
   guilty, and I will put away the sin."

   14-16. Turn, O backsliding children, says the LORD: for I am married
   unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I
   will bring you to Zion. And I will give you pastors according to My
   heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. And it
   shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land,
   in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The Ark of the
   Covenant of the LORD, neither shall it come to mind neither shall they
   remember it Neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done
   anymore. Evangelical repentance, when it brings pardon with it, usually
   puts a slight upon mere legal ceremonies. We need not the symbol when
   we get the substance! We need no Ark of the Covenant nor holy place at
   Jerusalem when once the Lord appears in plenteous Grace to put away our
   sin!

   17, 18. At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
   andall the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD,
   to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk anymore after the imagination of
   their evil heart. In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the
   house of Israel. Nothing unites people like the Grace of God. Two men
   that have been pardoned by the same Savior ought to love one another,
   and they will!

   18, 19. And they shall come together out of the land that I have given
   for an inheritance unto your fathers. But I said After all this mercy,
   He seems to come to a pause, "But I said"--

   19, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant and
   a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? Is it possible? Can it be
   done? These harlot nations that have defiled and polluted themselves
   with unutterable filthi-ness--can they be put among the children--the
   children of God?

   19-22. And I said, You shall call Me, my Father, and shall not turn
   away from Me. Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband,
   so have you dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, says the
   LORD. A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
   of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and
   theyhave forgotten the LORD their God. Return you backsliding children,
   and I will heal your backslidings. Do you hear it? Do you hear God's
   promise? Do you hear His command? "Return, you backsliding children. I
   will heal your backslid-ings." Now for the answer. God grant that it
   may well up in your hearts.

   22, 23. Behold, we come unto You, for You are the LORD our God. Truly
   in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude
   of mountains. We leave all false confidences. We forsake our earthly
   joys.

   23, 24. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel For shame
   has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and
   their herds, their sons and their daughters. They have not profited by
   worshipping idols. They have suffered through it.

   25. We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have
   sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth,
   even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
   There you see the repentance which the Lord commanded at His people's
   hands, and wherever there is such a repentance as that, there are sure
   to be acceptance and salvation! God grant us that repentance and save
   us for His mercy's sake!

   JEREMIAH 4:1-29.

   Verses 1, 2. If you will return, O Israel, says the LORD, return unto
   Me, and if you will put away your abominations out of My sight, then
   shall you not be moved. And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth,
   in judgment and in righteousness. And the nations shall bless
   themselves in Him, and in Him shall they glory. So he sets before them
   life and death. First, He begins with these words of encouragement. He
   begs them to come, for God is willing to receive them, notwithstanding
   all.

   3, 4. For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break
   up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves
   to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of
   Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest My fury come forth like fire,
   and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil ofyour doings.
   They had the outward religion, but the Lord's servant bids them know
   that they must have heartreligion. The heart must be purged--the inward
   must be cleansed. This they had no mind to. They would multiply their
   sacrifices and their outward performances, but as to cleanliness of
   heart, this they cared not for.

   5-7. Declare you in Judah, andpublish in Jerusalem and say, Blow you
   the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble
   yourselves andlet us go into the fortified cities. Set up the standard
   towards Zion, retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north
   and a great destruction. The lion is come up from his thicket, and the
   destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way: he is gone forth from his
   place to make your land desolate; and your cities shall be laid waste,
   without an inhabitant This was a terrible prophecy. The Chaldeans, who
   had broken to pieces so many other kingdoms and powers, were on their
   way! The enraged lion had leaped from his thicket and was about to
   tear, and rend, and do universal havoc! And if they did not turn to
   God, their whole land would be laid waste. One would think that such a
   heavy blow would have awakened them to a sense of their danger and
   their sin, but, alas, it was not so!

   8, 9. For this girdyou with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
   anger of the LORD is not turned back from us. And it shall come to pass
   at that day, says the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish,
   and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and
   the Prophets shall wonder. Universal fear would take hold upon them. If
   they would not rightly fear the Lord and turn to Him, the time would
   come when, without exception, the greatest and the wisest of them
   should be taken with a sudden panic!

   10. Then said I, Ah, Lord God! Surely You have greatly deceived this
   people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword
   reaches unto the soul. God promised them peace, but it was upon a
   condition which they did not fulfill. There was peace while they gave
   up their sin, but, "There is no peace with God unto the wicked." And so
   they missed it.

   11, 12. At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
   A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of
   My people, not to fan, nor to cleanse. Even a full wind from those
   places shall come unto Me: now also will'I give sentence against them.
   What an awful line that is. "Now also will I give sentence against
   them." They had been on their trial. They are found guilty. They will
   not repent. "Now will I proceed to pronounce their doom and give
   sentence against them."

   13. Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a
   whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us!For we are
   spoiled. They began to cry out when they began to smart. And the
   Prophet comes in, again.

   14. O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be
   saved. There is always that silver bell of mercy ringing out the note
   of invitation! "O Jerusalem, your sorrows, your destruction may yet be
   averted if you will turn from your darkness! Wash your heart from
   wickedness, that you may be saved."

   14-18. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you? For a voice
   declares from Dan, and publishes affliction from Mount Ephraim. Make
   you mention to the nations: behold, publish against Jerusalem that
   watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the
   cities of Judah. As keepers of a field, are they against her round
   about because she has been rebellious against Me, says the LORD. Your
   way and your doings have procured these things unto you. This is your
   wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reaches unto your heart.
   When "great judgments are abroad," it is always on account of great
   sin. It was so in the case of Israel. "Your doings have procured these
   things unto you." Oh, when the ungodly man begins to reap the result of
   his life--when, in his own body and in his own home, he begins to see
   what sin will often bring the drunkard, let him hear these words--"This
   is your wickedness. Your way and your doings have procured these things
   unto you."

   Now follows the lament of Jeremiah--one of the most amazing pieces of
   sorrowful writing that will ever be read in your hearing!

   19-21. O my soul, my soul! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes
   a noise in me: I cannot hold my peace because you have heard, O, my
   soul, the sound ofthe trumpet, the alarm of war! Destruction upon
   destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my
   tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. How long shall I see the
   standard and hear the sound ofthe trumpet? The dreadful blast of war,
   the blood-red flag of murder flying through the land while the
   Chaldeans slew right and left, young and old--we need to put ourselves
   into Jeremiah's position to be able to realize the horror of this case.

   22, 23. For My people are foolish, they have not known Me. They are
   silly children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do
   evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. I beheld the earth, and,
   lo, it was without form, and void: and the heavens, and they had no
   light. As if they had gone back to chaos--to the primeval darkness--to
   the first disorder before God began to create.

   24-29. Ibeheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
   moved lightly. Ibeheld, and lo, there was no man, and all the birds
   ofthe heavens were fled. I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place was a
   wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the Presence
   ofthe LORD, and by His fierce anger. For thus has the LORD said, The
   whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. For this
   shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have
   spoken it, I have purposed it and I will not repent, neither will I
   turn back from it. The whole city shall flee from the noise ofthe
   horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up upon the
   rocks. Every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. Now
   all this did happen. It all came to pass. Palestine, the glorious
   Garden of God, was made as dreary as a wilderness! It is not much
   better now. It has scarcely recovered. God will re-gather them to the
   land one day, but oh, what a sight it was when God at last had ended
   His patience--poured out the vials of His wrath upon His once favored
   land!

The Blessed Christ

   (No. 3427)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   21, 1870.

   "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that comes in the name of
   the Lord." Matthew 21:9.

   ONE feels very thankful that we have a few Hebrew words in common use
   in our Christian assemblies--a kind of link between Israel after the
   flesh and Israel after the spirit. "Hallelujah," they sang of old, and
   we sing, "Hallelujah," too. "Abba Father," they said. We also say,
   "Abba Father." And this word, "Hosanna," is another of the few that
   remain to us of which we understand the meaning, though we use them
   still in a translated form--Hosanna--"save Lord," "bless Lord."
   "Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord." I did not mention
   in the reading of the Psalm--(the 118th Psalm)--that both the 25th and
   26th verses of that Psalm begin with the word, Hosanna. One is
   translated, "Save Lord," and the other is, "Blessed is He that comes in
   the name of the Lord." I shall take this common exclamation, then,
   constantly used among the Jews, and we shall see as to its use among
   ourselves. And our first point will be to--

   I. CONSIDER OCCASIONS WHEN THIS EXCLAMATION, "Blessed is He that comes
   in the name of the Lord," HAS BEEN, OR WILL BE, SUITABLE.

   And, first, in the olden times, the Israelites were accustomed to use
   this cry, "Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord," when
   their heroes returned victorious from the battlefield. When they went
   up to the Temple to give thanks publicly to God for victories over
   their enemies, they were met by the people, with this exclamation
   ofjoy, "Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah's name." Very unlike the
   cries of other nations! Some nations only extolled the heroes, but the
   people of God see the hand of God, and they mark that the hero only
   comes in the name of the Lord. And while they give him blessings and
   wish him every good thing for what he has done, yet the praise is
   ascribed to the Master in whose name he comes--even Jehovah. While the
   Philistines would be extolling their god and Moab and Ammon would be
   lifting up the song to the idols they worshipped, Israel took care, in
   the song of triumph with which they saluted the returning victors, to
   extol and magnify the glory of the Lord--the Lord God of
   Israel--"Blessed is he that comes in the name of Jehovah." So, my dear
   Friends, whenever we thank men for kindnesses which they render to
   us--(and it is our duty to be grateful to them)--yet let us thank yet
   more the Lord our God! Thank God and thank the secondary means, but do
   not ascribe the honor to the instrument, alone, lest you set up an idol
   in the Presence of God! Always take care to see that God, whom you
   worship, makes all things work through your friends for your help and
   your deliverance. So to each one who shall bring you good--whether
   spiritual or temporal good--"Blessed is he that comes to me with this
   mercy. I recognize him as coming in Jehovah's name."

   This exclamation might again have been most commonly used of the coming
   of our Lord. The Word became Incarnate and stooped from the Throne of
   Heaven to the manger of Bethlehem's stable. I know not that these words
   precisely were used, but surely in this spirit the angels sang their
   midnight carol when the Savior descended--"Glory to God in the highest.
   On earth peace, goodwill towards men." What is the spirit of all that
   song but this word, "Hosanna"? What is the essence of it all, but this
   sentence, "Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord"? The
   shepherds could not have used a more significant and suitable
   expression--and the Easterners, as they gathered round that little
   cradle and offered their gold, their myrrh, and their incense, together
   with their grateful homage might have looked at Mary and Joseph, and
   the Child, and said of Him, "Blessed is He that comes in the name of
   the Lord." And had but the nations known it, had but Israel known it,
   had but the kings of the earth recognized it, one universal shout might
   have gone up to Heaven--"At last the promised One is come! The Seed of
   the woman is born! The Messiah has appeared! The Prince of

   Peace has come with innumerable blessings! Blessed is He that comes in
   Jehovah's name!" And I think the very sea and land, even the heavens
   and the Heaven of heavens, might have caught up the spirit of that
   hour, and the sea, with its waves, might have roared out, "Blessed is
   He that comes in the name of the Lord." And you forests--every tree
   within you--might have burst forth in the same note till all the
   nations would have become one mouth for song, "Blessed is He that comes
   in the name of the Lord."

   And this expression was used, according to my text, further on in our
   Savior's life. When He rode in triumph upon a colt, the foal of an ass,
   up to the Temple, when He went to take possession of His Father's
   House, and drive out the buyers and sellers, who had made it into a den
   of thieves--then in that day, when He was proclaimed King of the Jews,
   and the crowd of men mounted the trees and broke down the palm
   branches, juvenile voices all along the road shouted, "Hosanna." This
   was the hour of our Savior's gladness, and Jerusalem for once seemed as
   if she would shake off her solid coolness and would acknowledge Him
   whom God had sent! It were well for her if it had been so, but the
   Truth of God was hidden from her eyes and she became desolate, because
   more heartily and truthfully she had not said, "Blessed is He that
   comes in the name of the Lord."

   And shall I be thought to be fanciful if I suppose that this
   exclamation would have been most appropriate among the bands of angels
   and choirs of the blood-washed, when our Savior, having finished His
   lifework, ascended to His Throne? When they brought His chariot from on
   high to bear Him to His last place of rest, when He ascended on high,
   leading captivity captive, and the pearly gates were set open that He
   might enter, did not all those bright celestial spirits throng the
   streets of gold and cry "Hosanna: Blessed is He that comes in the name
   of the Lord"? I can scarcely think they could refrain from the
   expressions of their delight when they saw Him come with His garments
   dyed red, fresh from the slaughter of all His foes, triumphant over all
   that came against Him, the great Conqueror, the Hero who had routed,
   once and for all, all Israel's enemies and put them all beneath His
   feet! Surely they must have said, "Hosanna," yet again and again,
   "Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord"!

   And surely, to close the list of occasions, I may mention when He who
   went up from Olivet shall come a second time, in like manner as He went
   up into Heaven, that is to say, in very Person as He mounted to the
   skies, He will be saluted, will He not--by all His waiting people, with
   this grand exclamation, "Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is He
   that comes in the name of the Lord"? The coming of the Son of God is no
   joy to the ungodly world--the day of the Lord to them will be darkness,
   and not light--the earth will burn as an oven! "The day comes that
   shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and yes, and all that do
   wickedly, shall be stubble." To the righteous the coming of Christ is
   their grandest expectation--it is the day of the manifestation of the
   sons of God, the day for which the whole creation groans and travails,
   for it will be the day of our resurrection, when our souls that may
   have been a long while divorced from our bodies shall be re-married,
   and the body shall be raised again like unto His glorious body! "For we
   know that when He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see
   Him as He is." The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come," and that same
   Spirit and Bride shall say, "Welcome, welcome, King of Kings!" when He
   shall come. Those who have watched most, and longed most, and hungered
   and thirsted most after that glorious Advent shall be they who most
   joyfully shall go forth to meet King Solomon with the crown wherewith
   his mother crowned him in the day of his espousal, and this shall be
   the note of their triumphant greeting, "Hosanna: Blessed is He that
   comes in Jehovah's name." Thus I have very briefly run through the
   occasions when this exclamation would seem to be exceedingly suitable.
   Now let us for a while consider--

   II. THE SUITABILITY OF THIS CRY FOR CONSTANT USE--not now and then, but
   always! And it may be viewed in two lights. First, as an exultation.
   "Blessed is He that comes." He is blessed. It is a blessed thing that
   He has come. It may be viewed, in the next place, as a prayer, let Him
   be blessed, let Him prosper and so on. First, then, as an exultation, a
   note of triumph, He is blessed that He has come in the name of the
   Lord, and ought we not to be always saying this, "Blessed is He that He
   should condescend to tabernacle among men! Blessed is He that it should
   be true that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, that we might
   behold His Glory, the Glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full
   of Grace and Truth"? He is blessed, for He came to earth fully
   qualified for all His work, endowed with all the wisdom, the knowledge,
   the unction, the anointing from on high that He could wish. He was
   blessed in His coming, blessed while He carried on the work. Though His
   the pain and sorrow, yet it was all blessing to us, from the first act
   He did as a Man until He said, "It is finished." When I think of Him
   coming down as a Man, coming down as a Servant, coming to take upon
   Himself to die for our sins, I can indeed say, "Blessed is He that
   comes to all this in the name of the

   Lord"--comes as our Brother, comes as our Priest, comes as our
   Substitute, comes as our Scapegoat, comes as our great Deliverer and
   propitiatory Sacrifice that we might be cleansed from sin! He is
   blessed--all blessings are in Him, all blessings come through Him, all
   blessings belong to Him! God has given all blessings to Him because of
   this. He is blessed. And, Brothers and Sisters, if He is blessed in the
   work and the carrying of it on, is He not, and shall He not be blessed
   in our esteem, now that He has mounted to the skies and taken the
   precious blood within the veil and sprinkled it there-- and stands
   there now pleading as a prevalent High Priest for us? Blessed is He
   that came in Jehovah's name--the great Ambassador of Peace between
   offended Deity and revolted man. He is our Peace and let His name
   forever be blessed! He is our Prince--let us adore Him! He is all our
   salvation, all our desire! We ask nothing more than to be like He and
   be with Him. Blessings in Him! He is blessed! God has blessed Him!
   Forever and forever shall all generations call Him blessed! It is an
   exultation, then. We shout to His triumph, "Blessed is He that comes!"

   But it is a prayer. My dear Friends, we desire to do all we can for the
   Lord Jesus Christ, but how very limited are our capacities! If we were
   to give Him all we have, and give our bodies to be burned, it would be
   very little for us to give to such a Savior. But what a mercy it is
   that there is no limit to what we may wish. We can bless Him with our
   wishes, if we cannot with our acts. I was about to say we may bless Him
   infinitely with our desires. At any rate, there is no limit to our
   capacity to desire. And those desires may take the very acceptable and
   prevalent form of prayer. What I cannot do for Christ, I can pray God
   to be done. What if I cannot preach His Gospel in every land, yet where
   I can, I will preach it and pray God to raise up many to proclaim it.
   And if I cannot crown His head with many crowns, yet would I lay at His
   feet such as I have, and then my desireswould crown Him over, and over,
   and over again, and my prayers would clamber up to His lofty Throne and
   put fresh coronets upon His dear head, blessing Him that He does not
   deny me a share of wishing what I cannot do, and of praying for what I
   cannot give! In this sense, Brothers and Sisters, we can, to a very
   great extent, bless Him who comes in the name of the Lord--bless Him
   with our wishes, our desires, our earnestness and especially with our
   prayers.

   Now, what is the blessing, then, which we would seek for our Lord,
   Jesus Christ? What are the prayers that we would offer for Him? It is
   written, "Prayer also shall be made for Him continually." What shall we
   ask for Him?

   We will ask, first, that He that comes in the name of the Lord may be
   blessed in His Church. Oh, that He would bless the Church just now. I
   am afraid we have fallen upon lean times just now. It may be that God
   is about to chastise His Church, because when we had a revival we had
   not Grace enough to keep it. Almost universally there is a cloud
   hanging over Israel--lethargy coming in place of earnestness. God knows
   we were never very earnest--I mean the Church of God at large was not
   very earnest--but yet that earnestness which did arise seems now to be
   vanishing. I pray God it may not vanish, but, on the contrary, may all
   the zeal which has been in our days be far exceeded--all the agony for
   souls, all the labor to proclaim the Grace of God to them, all the
   earnest desires and prayers of God's people--may all these be renewed
   with tenfold vigor, and in this way may we have to cry, "The Lord has
   visited His Church, and let His name be blessed." We do tonight, I
   trust, put up the prayer, each one of us who belongs to this Church and
   people, "Lord prosper Your Word, be pleased to give power to your
   minister and increased Grace to your servants, holiness of life,
   separation from the world, power in prayer--give them communion with
   Yourself! Grant that there may be peace within the borders of your
   Church, and that the citizens of Zion may be filled with the finest of
   the wheat." In this respect we will bless Christ by desiring a blessing
   on His Church and seeking to promote its prosperity.

   Next to this, I say, "Lord save"--"Lord bless"--Him that comes,
   (putting it as a prayer for the scattering of the Church's enemies and
   His own enemies. Christ still has many enemies in the world. The Pope,
   the Antichrist of Rome, with all his doctors and counselors, assemble
   at this very hour--the incarnate Antichrist--at this present moment!
   And here, in this England of ours, there are priests busy up and down,
   in every court and lane, in every corner of the land, and our clergy of
   the Established Church, many of them double-dyed Papists, doing the
   work of Rome and eating the bread of a Protestant Church at the same
   time! And then there is infidelity, seeking all it can to make its
   converts, with a zeal which were commendable if it were used for a
   right purpose. They compass sea and land to make proselytes, and shame
   the coldness of many professed followers of Christ. The enemies of
   Christ are very many. The Church is very feeble, yes, she is like a
   reed shaken by the wind. Without her Lord, she is less than
   nothing--like chaff in the whirlwind! But, oh, let us pray that He may
   be blessed who comes in the name of the Lord by the scattering of all
   His enemies, by the putting down of spiritual wickedness in high
   places, and giving the victory to the Truth and to the Gospel--that
   which saves - putting to flight that which destroys before that which
   purifies--scattering that which defiles before that which glorifies
   God, annihilating that which blasphemes His holy name! May Christ be
   blessed as a Conqueror over His foes!

   We may, further, very earnestly pray that the Lord may be blessed in
   the conversion of souls. Oh, would to God He were blessed in that
   respect in this congregation more and more! Preaching becomes very dead
   work when there are no converts. Sowing is very well and one likes it
   at the sowing season, but if a man had to sow all the year round and
   never saw the golden sheaves, he might well grow weary. Though, indeed,
   in sowing for God we ought not to be weary, yet the tendency is to be
   so. How few conversions there are anywhere just now! The Church does
   not increase at all in the same rate as the population does. Every year
   I believe that the sin of London is gaining upon the Gospel, and all
   the efforts that are made do not tell upon the masses. We scarcely hold
   our ground! Certainly we make very little if any, advance. Of course,
   we congratulate ourselves that there are so many churches built. Does
   anybody go to them? We sometimes think there are so many Chapels. Yes,
   but how many are there that are half empty, or even less occupied than
   that? And what if they are full, yet in how many places is the Gospel
   preached very uncertainly and no certain sound is given from the
   trumpet? It is Christ that is preached in a measure, but preached in a
   fog--certainly not in the way that is so plain that wayfaring men need
   not err therein, but in a way that is so perplexing and involved in
   hard words and gaudy obscurities of rhetoric, that oftentimes many know
   not their right hand from their left, and look on, marveling at the
   orator who speaks so grandly, but what he says, or whereof he affirmed,
   they utterly know not! How many there are that have the key of
   knowledge, but open not the door! They seem rather to show how
   delightfully they can lock it and how skillfully they can shut out the
   multitude! We need to see conversions! May God send them everywhere
   throughout this land by the tens of thousands! And in other lands,
   would God there were conversions by the millions! The world teems with
   population, but Jesus Christ has as yet few who find Him. Straight is
   the gate and narrow is the way, and few there are that go in at the
   gate or tread that road. O Lord, how long, how long, how long? Arise
   and convert sinners to Yourself!

   The same thought comes to us only a little enlarged. Our desire in
   prayer for Christ is that He may the blessed in the sense of being
   glorious to the ends of the earth. We have no doubts about the issue of
   the struggle in which we are engaged--against the powers of darkness.
   It may be a thousand years before Christianity is prevalent. It may be
   ten thousand years! It may be fifty thousand years, it may be a hundred
   thousand years! We, none of us, know. To God it will be quick, very
   quickly--and in but a short time--behold Christ comes quickly! But
   that, "quickly," may not mean what we think it does, and they who sit
   down and say it will be the next twenty, or fifty, or 100 years know
   not what they say, nor whereof they affirm! We who are working now are
   very like, as I believe, those coral insects that are about to build a
   reef. They begin at the bottom of the sea. They lay, first of all, the
   foundations, broad and strong. It will be a long, long, long, long
   while before that reef will come to the top of the sea, before it will
   be seen, before earth and weeds will be attracted to it. It will be
   still longer before there begins to grow upon it certain tiny plants
   and mosses--still longer before the cocoanut begins to spring, and
   before men and animals shall be found there. Now, those first insects
   that lay the foundation die. They have gone, and the next, and the
   next, and the next and the reef is still unseen. That is very like what
   we are. All we can do is to keep on working, working with all our
   might. Our prayer ought not to be that we should see the whole of our
   success. I like Moses' prayer--"Let Your work appear unto Your
   servants! And Your Glory unto their children." Hence no matter how
   things are--it may have been that we have hardly stood our ground, and
   we can hardly say the Lord's cause has prospered--still, we have only
   seen the beginning! And we may rest assured that when the latter verses
   of this grand poem shall come, though the book may have opened somewhat
   dolorously and gloomily, the end will be, "Sing unto the Lord for He
   has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has He cast into the
   sea." In any great cause that is undertaken in any country, it is not
   one generation that succeeds. Many generations have to take part in it.
   There is a period of contempt for even common political principles--a
   period of neglect--afterwards a period of contempt--then, perhaps, a
   period of absolute persecution, and then, perhaps, when we least expect
   it, there comes the moment of victory. And so it will be with the great
   cause of Christ! Only let this be our prayer, that the Lord would cut
   short His work in righteousness. That He would be pleased to soon come
   forth with His sword girt upon His thigh and take to Himself His great
   power and reign! Before another year comes, if the Lord wills, the
   nations may all give up their idols and turn to Christ! God can do as
   He pleases. Time is nothing to Him. With men, steel and iron must be
   worked gradually, but in the world of spirits, God has but to strike a
   spark and the fire will run along the ground and illumine the earth
   with its sacred conflagration! He can affect all minds at once, and
   turn the heart of the child to the Father, andthe hearts of all men to
   the great Prince of Peace, if so He wills it! And, perhaps, He means to
   do that--to save the whole battle for one grand last charge when the
   King, Himself, shall lead the van, and then the conquering banner shall
   be seen, and the Lord God Omnipotent shall reign! Be it as He wills, we
   will always say under every discouragement, at all times when we see
   not our sign, "Blessed be You, Jesus! You shall get the crown and be
   Conqueror yet! May Your Kingdom come, and Your will be done as in
   Heaven, so on earth!"

   Now, lastly, there are times, dear Friends, when this exclamation may
   be used about ourselves personally. I will only hint at these times.
   The first is at our conversion. When we had been in sorrow and trouble,
   under sin--when the Law had made sin revive and we died, when every
   hope was hurled in despair--you remember how you and I welcomed Christ.
   I remember the very Sabbath morning and the spot of ground. Some of you
   may not so distinctly remember--that does not matter--but some of you
   can. Oh, how blessed was he who came to us in the name of the Lord! Sin
   was forgiven. Doubts fled, despair vanished, joy and peace flowed in
   our souls, leapt within us, and we were so happy--we scarcely knew how
   to express our joy and our love! Oh, dear Savior, on that first day of
   our spiritual birth, and afterwards while we were yet in the love of
   our espousals, we could do no other than say, "Blessed is He, the dear
   precious and exalted Savior, who has come to me in the Lord's name and
   saved my soul!" Since that day we have, every now and then, had
   repetitions of our conversion--renewals of the Presence of God. You had
   got very dull and worldly, and your soul was cleaving to the dust, but,
   perhaps, it was under a sermon or in private prayer. Or it may have
   been in the middle of your business the Lord returned to you--He became
   the health of your countenance and restored your soul! Oh, I know how
   you sang, when your communion with Christ began to be as sweet as it
   was before, "Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord!" The
   Lord send such seasons to any of you who are backsliding! May He come
   to you, now, and knock at the door of your heart! Oh, open to Him and
   bid Him come in, for there is no power on earth that can revive a
   decaying heart like the coming of Christ afresh by renewed communion!
   So too, dear Friends, you and I have said this when we have had some
   very happy seasons in the house of the Lord. Have you not sometimes, in
   this very place, when our voice has gone up in song (the thousands
   praising God)--when we have been all moved by gracious Words of
   Scripture, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind--have you
   not been inclined to burst out with the note, "Hosanna! Blessed is He
   that comes in the name of the Lord"? Why, the very preacher has been
   beloved to you for his Master's sake! But the preacher's Master--oh,
   what love you felt in your heart for Him--what joy at the sound of His
   name! What delight when it has been like ointment poured forth, and the
   love of God has been shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit which
   is given unto you! Do you not remember when you went up with the
   multitude that kept holy day, when you went up to the altar of God with
   exceeding joy, with the voice of thanksgiving? Ah, then it was--

   "Blessings forever on the Lamb, Who bore the Cross for wretched men."

   And once again, to conclude, whenever God visits His Church with a
   revival, then the cry goes up, "Blessed is He that comes in the name of
   the Lord"--a revival of religion, I mean, of this kind--when a deep
   religious concern is upon all, when Christians become more earnest and
   more prayerful, when they become more attentive to the unconverted and
   more anxious to see them saved. And when the unconverted, themselves,
   take a deeper interest in the Word--when they begin to feel their sin,
   when they cry out for mercy, when they ask the way to Zion! We have had
   the Lord with us now these 17 years with no bursts of excitement, but
   with one continual stream of blessing--and I am so anxious that we
   should not lose it. I could wish that we might see some token of even a
   larger measure of His Presence than we have had yet. I would ask some
   of you that have power in prayer to join with me every morning and
   every night in a prayer that He would come to us afresh. We are not
   discouraged--very far from it. We have never been without many
   enquirers and many being added to the Church, but still, there are
   unconverted ones in the congregation. We have found at the Tabernacle
   what we had at Park Street, that we have many more members than seats.
   I remember one man coming one night to have a seat who was very honest
   and wanted to see me, first, before he took a sitting. "Sir," he said,
   "somebody told me that I should be expected to be converted if I took a
   seat, and I cannot guarantee that." I said, "My dear Friend, somebody
   has told you the right thing, but he has not put it exactly right. If
   you take a seat, we expect that you will be converted. It is not that
   you are expected to convert yourself, but we expect that if you hear
   the Word, God will bless you, because," I said, "I hardly know any who
   have sat there but have been converted." I was very glad to find there
   was all current among the seat-holders that God would bless them! I
   believe He will. But still, I wish we had more members. Wehave 4,200, I
   think, but we can hold more than that. I would like to see six
   thousand! What a joy it would be! So many that I would be half inclined
   to say I must go and fish in another pool--they are all caught here!
   Would not it be a mercy if there were no more fish in the sea to be
   caught, but all were converted--everyone that comes into this
   Tabernacle? His power is infinite! There is no limit to that, except
   that our unbelief in the economy of Grace is sometimes allowed to limit
   it. What is said converted to God! If you could go out and do good to
   others, and bring others in, and other churches could be formed, what a
   blessing might come of it! And why not? "He could not do many mighty
   works there, because of their unbelief." Oh, that this might be taken
   away from us! May we believe, and we shall see! May we trust and pray,
   and we shall joyfully behold it! Oh, that some poor sinner would come
   to Jesus Christ tonight! He would, indeed, have to say, "Blessed is he
   that comes in the name of the Lord." One prayer will bring you to Him,
   if it is sincere. Simply to trust Him--that is the thing! To rely upon
   Him--that is all! He died for the guilty. His blood was shed for the
   foul. Come and trust Him and yield to Him! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM118.

   Verse 1. Ogive thanks unto the LORD: for He is good: because His mercy
   endures forever Here is a standing reason for thanksgiving. Although we
   may not always be healthy, nor always prosperous, yet God is always
   good and, therefore, there is always a sufficient argument for giving
   thanks unto Jehovah, That He is a good God essentially--that He cannot
   be otherwise than good--should be a fountain out of which the richest
   praises should perpetually flow.

   2, 3. Let Israel now say that His mercy endures forever Let the house
   of Aaron now say that His mercy endures forever These were especially
   set apart for God's service and, therefore, where much in given, much
   is expected. The house of Aaron, therefore, must have a special note of
   thanksgiving, and though we who preach the Gospel claim no sort of
   priesthood, yet if any ought to lead the strain of thankfulness, it
   should be those who minister continually for God.

   4. Let them now that fear the LORD say that His mercy endures forever
   Let them all say it--let them all say it now--let every one of us say
   it for himself, "His mercy endures forever."

   5. I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me and set me
   in a large place. I think many of us could make just such a record as
   that and not once, but many times in our lives we could say, "I called
   upon the Lord in distress." We have had many trials, but we have a
   Mercy Seat always to fly to and a God always ready to hear the cries of
   His distressed ones.

   6. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do to me?The
   past always gives us assurance for the future, for we are dealing with
   the same unchangeable God and, therefore, we may expect to have the
   same dealings from Him.

   7. 8. The LORD takes my part with them that help me: therefore shall I
   see my desire upon those who hate me. It is better to trust in the LORD
   than to put confidence in man. There is one text which I have never
   seen put up anywhere. You have illuminated texts in your houses and
   schoolrooms, and so on, but I think I have never seen this, "Cursed is
   he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm." Or this other one,
   "Cease you, from man whose breath is in his nostrils, for wherein is he
   to be accounted of?" And I am sure there is no teaching of Scripture
   more necessary than that, whether it refers to great men or to little
   men, whether it refers to men of eminence, or to those of your own
   family circle. "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
   confidence in man."

   9. It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
   It is nobler, it is more agreeable to sound reason, it will lead to
   better results. God better deserves our confidence than the princes of
   the earth do--even the best of them.

   10. All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I
   destroy them. This may apply to David, but it applied better to Christ,
   around whom Jews and Gentiles came, but He won the victory over them.

   11. 12. They compassedme about: yes, they compassedme about: but in the
   name of the LORD I will destroy them. They compassed me about like
   bees, they are quenched as fire of thorns; for in the name of the LORD
   I will destroy them. The thorn makes a good blaze and crackles and
   splutters, but it is soon out. "For in the name of the Lord will I
   destroy them." In this way we may meet our spiritual foes, temptations,
   trials, the world, sin, death, Hell--the name of Jehovahshall be our
   strength. "In hoc signo vincitt" said one of old--"By this sign you
   conquer," and so by this sign we also overcome through the blood of the
   Lamb!

   13. You have thrust sore at me that I might fall; but the Lord helped
   me. This will rebut all the attacks of our fiercest foes--"But the Lord
   helped me."

   14, 15. The LORD is my strength and song, and has become my salvation.
   The voice of rejoicing and salvation in the tabernacles of the
   righteous: the right hand of the LORD does valiantly. Where God's
   people dwell, there is the voice of joy. "Their family prayer
   sanctifies the house with its joyous notes." Even then there is trouble
   and sorrow in the house, yet resignation still makes joy and rejoicing
   there. And if rejoicing for a moment should go, yet salvation never
   does. "This day is salvation come to your house. If you are now a
   converted man, it will never go away. It is an abiding thing--it is in
   the tabernacles of the righteous.

   16, 17. The right hand of the LORD is exalted, the right hand of the
   LORD does valiantly. I shall not die but live, and declare the works of
   the LORD. Some have thought this Psalm was composed by Hezekiah after
   his sickness, and after the destruction of Senacherib's host. It may be
   so. It has been used by many besides Hezekiah, who have not forgotten
   that these are the words of Wickliffe, used when monks came round his
   dying bed with prayers, Paternosters and crucifixes and urged him to
   repent, and he said, "I shall not die, but live and declare the works
   of the Lord." And so, indeed, he did!

   18. The LORD has chastened me sorely: but He has not given me over unto
   death. Many of His best children can say this, for, "whom the Lord
   loves He chastens." "The Lord has chastened me sorely, but He has not
   given me over unto death." You that have recovered from sickness, here
   is a song for you who above all were not given over to your sins and to
   the just punishment of them! Here is music for you, "He has not given
   me over to the second death which He might have done."

   19, 20. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them and
   I will praise the LORD. This gate of the LORD into which the righteous
   shall enter. I suppose he who uttered these words has passed through
   the beautiful gates of the Temple.

   21. I will praise You: for You have heard me, and have become my
   salvation. Future, past, present--all full of blessing!

   22-24. The stone which the builders refusedis become the headstone
   ofthe corner. This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.
   This is the day which the LORD has made: we will rejoice and be glad in
   it. Though this is applicable to the Sabbath, yet it is also applicable
   to any day and to every day which God especially makes glorious by
   delivering many.

   25-27. Save now, I beseech You, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech You, send now
   prosperity. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD: we have
   blessed you out of the house of the LORD. God is the LORD, who has
   showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of
   the altar.It is the king returning from victory and recovered from
   sickness. He brings his sacrifice with thanksgiving, as every child of
   God should, and there it is, ready bound to the altar horns.

   28, 29. You are my God, and I will praise You: You are my God, I will
   exalt You. O give thanks unto the LORD: for He is good; for His mercy
   endures forever.

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will show
   them His Covenant." Psalm 25:14.

   THIS text is a great deep, but at the outset we must say that we have
   neither the time nor the skill at this time to attempt to fathom it.
   Our business just now is not so much to dive into its profound mystery,
   as to skim over its sparkling surface, to touch it with our wing as the
   swallow sometimes does the brook, leaving its soundings still
   unexplored. The current of thought here is too deep and too broad for
   the short meditation of a weekday evening. But where the very surface
   is rich, as it were, with "dust of gold," we cannot fail, if God the
   Holy Spirit blesses us, to be enriched by even the superficial
   reflections we may gather up from it.

   "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him." Mark the word
   used--"THE LORD"--Jehovah in the original--the I AM THAT I AM. The very
   name is associated in the thought of every right-minded person with
   awe. Is it not the name of the one only living and true God, and none
   who take it in vain shall be held guiltless? The gods of the heathen
   are no gods, but our God made the heavens! It is by Him that the
   heavens were stretched out as a curtain and as a tent to dwell in. He
   is the Preserver of all things. In Him "we live, and move, and have our
   being." As we find Him manifested, both in the book of Nature and in
   the Book of Revelation, He is a God "glorious in holiness, fearful in
   praises, doing wonders." The Lord is a good God, and we cannot think of
   Him without awe. If you have ever heard His voice in pealing thunder or
   the rolling avalanche, or if you have seen the flashes of His spear in
   the lightning of the tempest, or if you have marked His going upon the
   mighty waves at the tempestuous sea, you must have felt within
   yourselves that He is high and mighty--in truth, a terrible God! Yet it
   seems from our text that there are some persons in the world in whom
   all emotions of dread in connection with God are suppressed by feelings
   of quite another kind. Though clouds and darkness are round about Him,
   they have evidently passed through the clouds and have come to the
   other side of the darkness, for "the secret of the Lord is with them."
   Before Him goes the pestilence. And hot burning coals are cast forth at
   His feet, but these persons must evidently have been preserved from the
   devouring pestilence by some mysterious power--and have escaped those
   burning coals by some gracious deliverance! They have come into
   familiarity with God! They know His secret and He shows to them what He
   does not make known to other men--His Covenant--the counsel of His
   will! There are such persons in the world, now, to whom the Eternal
   Majesty is so tempered by Infinite Mercy that they can devoutly sing--

   "The God who rules on high,

   And thunders when He pleases,

   Who rides upon the stormy skies,

   And manages the seas.

   This awful God is ours,

   Our Father and our Love.

   He shall send down His heavenly powers,

   To carry us above."

   Think of "the Lord," then, according to this grand revelation of His
   name--Jehovah. Oh, that your thoughts of Him might bow you down with
   the lowly worship of the bright cherubim, and make you veil your faces
   as they do! Oh, that you might be led to feel how great God is and how
   little you are! Oh, that Grace were now given you to draw near to God
   and that the passage on which we have alighted might become a place of
   communion with Him!

   Observe, then, first of all, a glorious privilege which may be
   possessed. Secondly, a favored class of people who do possess it. And
   thirdly, a choice and peculiar manifestation which God makes to them.
   I. THERE IS A GLORIOUS PRIVILEGE WHICH MAY BE POSSESSED.

   The word, "secret," here might, with greater propriety, be translated,
   "friendship." "The friendship of the Lord is with them that fear Him,"
   but it also signifies in its root, that conversation which familiar
   friends hold with each other. Conversation in its most cherished
   exercise, that homely conversation which springs from mutual confidence
   and is, on the part of one man, the unbosoming of himself to another,
   is thus implied. If I may open it up in a phrase, it means, "The amity
   of true friendship." Such is the favor vouchsafed to those who fear
   God. But taking the word as it stands, (for I dare say the translators
   weighed all these variations well before they chose the one before us),
   we will endeavor to give amplitude to the sense, while we keep to the
   word, "secret."

   Beyond a doubt, then, those who fear God have the secret of His
   Presence revealed to them. If a man rambles amidst the wonders of
   Nature with an atheistic heart, he may look up to the snowy peaks and
   down again upon the sweet grassy slopes. He may listen to the music of
   the waterfall. He may stand and admire the eagle as it soars aloft, or
   watch the wild goat as it leaps from crag to crag--and all these things
   may be to him but so much animated Nature--matter in so many various
   shapes and nothing more! I suppose it is possible for men to be
   familiar with all that is beautiful and sublime in the world of Nature,
   that "living visible garment of God," and yet never catch the secret of
   His Presence, the traces of His handiwork, or the whisper of His voice.
   How different it is with the man who fears God, who has bowed before
   God's Justice and seen it satisfied through the atoning Sacrifice of
   Calvary! Such a man, as he looks upon the things that are made, those
   silent witnesses of the eternal power and Godhead, says, "My Father
   made them all!"

   "Not hear God?" he says, "I as distinctly heard God speak in the
   thunderclap as I have heard my own father's voice!" Not see God? Why,
   the veil seems thin that hides His glorious features while the works
   shine transparent that unveil His wondrous attributes! So that to the
   Christian it becomes a moral phenomenon that there should be people in
   the world who can survey the gorgeous plan, the unfailing order and the
   ample furniture, as it were, of this earth, with its wonderful
   adaptation of the means to the end, and then peer upwards to the
   heavens so grandly garnished, and contemplate the celestial bodies,
   ever restless, ever orderly in their motions, yet fail to apprehend the
   greatness, the wisdom, the goodness of the Creator! To us He is
   apparent everywhere--

   "These are Your works, Father of good, Almighty! Yours this universal
   frame!"

   He knows, he feels that fallen as he is, he can, while walking through
   this world, commune with God as Adam did before Paradise was lost to
   him. The secret of God's Presence is with them that fear Him. We have
   heard of some who have said that they have never had any consciousness
   of the existence of spirit. Very likely. Very likely. I do not suppose,
   either, that pigs or asses, or any dumb driven cattle ever had any
   spiritual apprehensions! But some of us have a very clear consciousness
   thereof and, as honest men giving testimony, we claim to be believed.
   No, what is more, we are certain that we have not only a consciousness
   of the existence of spirit, but of a great and all-pervading Spirit we
   have a like clear knowledge! We cannot be mistaken about it! We are as
   sure that there is a God as we are that there is a world. No, sometimes
   more persuaded of the one than of the other! It is a part of our real
   consciousness. We have come to feel it, not merely in our imaginative
   moods, but when all our faculties were in full play--the secret of the
   existence of the pervading Presence of God is with us if we fear Him!
   No, it is not only in the open fields, amidst the enchanting scenery of
   the world, but much more in shady nooks and secluded places that we
   have found that Presence!

   Some months ago, I sat by the side of a woman who had not left her bed
   for several years. It was in a sloping room at the top of a cottage.
   The only walls were just the plastering that roofed it in. The room was
   hung round with texts of Scripture, which she had painted as she had
   been lying there. She was always full of pain--restless nights and
   weary days were her constant lot. When I sat down to talk to her, she
   said, "You cannot tell how the Presence of God has made this room seem
   to me, Sir! It has been such a palace that I have not envied kings upon
   their thrones when I have enjoyed the visits of Christ here. Though I
   have not known a wakeful hour free from pain for years, I assure you
   this chamber has been a very Heaven to me." She was not an excitable,
   hysterical, silly, weak-minded woman. Far from that, she was as simple
   and sincere a creature as you might have found in fifty miles' walk.
   The daughter of an honest, smock-frocked laborer and his quiet, godly
   wife. There was this poor woman declaring that God was ever in her
   room. As I talked withher, I began to feel that her witness was true,
   and to think that I had not felt more conscious of the Presence of the
   Almighty among the baseless, boundless mountains, or upon the watery
   plain of the vast ocean, where mighty waves in ceaseless concert roll,
   or even in the midst of the vast congregation, when on the Sabbath our
   solemn hymns, the outflow of feeling hearts, have swelled to Heaven
   with music such as pleases well the ear of God! Thus I did then
   perceive the mysterious secret of His Presence when I lingered by the
   lowly couch of His suffering saint! Why, had some skeptic called in
   there and merely suggested that "there is no God," we would have
   laughed him to scorn, or else, perhaps, our pity for this ignorance
   might have turned our laughter into tears. Truly the secret of God's
   Presence everywhere is with them who fear Him. They trust Him, they
   love Him, they lean upon Him and they get to feel that He is--and they
   have communion with Him as a man communes with his friend!

   And this secret of God's Presence leads to the discerning of His hand.
   To the man who looks no higher than second causes, things that baffle
   his shallow wits like a continued drought in spring, or heavy rain in
   harvest, seem alike dreadful and bewildering. Though he cannot
   understand, perhaps, the laws of fluidity, he is likely enough to
   murmur at the dispensations that frustrate his conjectures. But the
   Christian says, "I believe that God ordains every drop of rain, or
   withholds every genial shower when He binds up the bottles of Heaven. I
   can find philosophy in faith." And here he is right. It has well been
   said, "There is more wisdom in a whispered prayer than in the ancient
   lore of all the schools." And wonderful it is how this simple, silent
   trust gives the Christian calmness and composure. At sea, when the
   tempest rages and the billows roar, the man who knows of nothing but
   the devouring element beneath and around him, full of alarm, may sigh
   to the winds. But the Christian who firmly believes that God holds the
   sea in the hollow of His hands and, that "all must come, and last, and
   end, as shall please his heavenly Friend," waits the leisure of the
   righteous God, commits his way unto Him, assured that He has control
   over the storm and fulfils His great decrees unmoved by threatening
   clouds or scolding winds. Faith feeds his fortitude! Listening with the
   ears of faith, he constantly hears the footfalls of Jehovah. In the
   loneliness of his sorrow, he catches a sweet whisper, saying to him,
   "It is I, be not afraid." The Divine Presence and the Divine hand,
   mysteriously hidden though they are, from all mortal eyes, are
   discerned by such as live in fellowship with God, for "the secret of
   the Lord is with them that fear Him."

   Hence it is that the child of God carries on a secret conversation with
   Heaven. See him on his knees--he talks with God, he pours out his heart
   before the Lord. And in return--whether the world chooses to believe
   it, or not, it is a matter of fact with us--in return the great
   Invisible Spirit pours into the praying heart a stream of sacred
   comfort, keeps it in its time of trouble and gives it to rejoice in its
   moments of sadness. Oh, some of you are living witnesses that God talks
   with men! Had you never talked with Him, you would not be qualified to
   speak upon this question, but knowing that He hears you, and being
   conscious that He also answers you and speaks to you, you can declare
   and rejoice in the declaration that the secret of the Lord in this
   respect is with you. Why, the Christian makes communications to God of
   such a sort as he would not venture to make to his fellow men. I
   consider the confession of sins to a priest most degrading to that
   priest. To make his ear the common sewer of all the filth of a parish
   is horrible--and for any man to tell his sin at all to another is
   depraving to his own mind. But to tell it to God is a different matter,
   to lay bare his bosom, to let its inmost secrets be exposed to the
   great Searcher of Hearts, to pour out what one cannot say in words, nor
   even perhaps convey with signs before the great eye which still sees,
   the great Searcher who discerns it all--oh, this is blessed! Every
   child of God can say, when he is in a right state, that there is no
   reserve or disguise in the dealings of his soul with God! Is there a
   care which I dare not cast on Him? Is there a sin which I would not
   humbly and tearfully confess before Him? Is there a need for which I
   would not seek relief from Him? Is there a dilemma in which I would not
   consult Him? Is there anything so confidential that I may not divulge
   to man, but which I may not breathe out to my God? Oh, when we are in
   spiritual health, we do verily pour our hearts before the Lord to the
   very dregs! We wear our heart upon our sleeve as we draw near to the
   Most High. I tell Him all my woes and weaknesses, all my sorrows and
   sins, likewise, so my secret is with Him. Then the Lord is pleased in
   return to manifest Himself unto His people. He shows to His trustful
   saints what He never shows to faithless sinners. When the sinner reads
   the Bible, he sees only the letter--that is all he can see--but the
   Christian sees the Spirit of the Word! He perceives that "within this
   awful volume lies the mystery of mysteries"--and he is one of those--

   "Happiest of the human race,

   To whom their God has given Grace,

   To read, to fear, to hope, to pray, To lift the latch to force the
   way."

   Thus he enters into the secret chamber of Revelation, while the
   unconverted, the unregenerated, the unsanctified, stand in the outside
   court and find no entrance within the veil. The heart of God is poured
   out into the Christian's heart, so far as the Infinite can disclose
   itself to the finite. And as we tell the Lord what we are, He is
   pleased to tell us what He is. Surely, dear Friends, as these
   intercommunications go on, it would be hard to say how richly the
   inmost secrets of God may become known to His privileged people. Shall
   I be understood if I say that man may know a great deal more than he
   thinks he knows? He may know more of God than he knows he knows, for it
   is one thing to know, and another thing to know that we know! Do you
   notice how John says, "That we may know that we know Him"?--as if we
   might know Him and yet be hardly able to recognize how much we know
   Him. Now, many a time you have known the secret decrees of God, though
   you have not known that you knew them. "Oh," you say, "how is that?"
   Well, God decreed, purposed and determined to save such-and-such a
   soul. You felt an irresistible impulse to go and pray for that soul as
   you had never prayed before. You mentioned that particular person by
   name before God and then you went out and exercised all the spiritual
   Grace you had in order to bring that soul to the knowledge of the Truth
   of God--and God blessed your endeavor and that soul was saved. Now, how
   was this? Why, the secret purpose of God had been made to act
   mysteriously upon you! You became God's instrument--His conscious
   instrument in the fulfillment of it--and thus you were made privy to
   the decree, though scarcely aware that you were so!

   I think there is such a harmony between the feeling of Christians and
   the purposes of God that you and I can never tell where these two
   unite, or where they separate. It often seems as if the Lord said to
   His people, "Now, I have ordained such-and-such things--in the volume
   of My Book they are written--and you shall desire and purpose just such
   things in your heart! And so the things that are in your heart shall
   carry out the things that are in My Book--I will not let you know it so
   as to go and tell it to others, but I will make you so know it that you
   will go and act upon it! I will let the secret of the Lord be with
   you." We know not how often God gives His people premonitions of what
   He is about to do, nor how frequently! Unknown to ourselves, we take a
   course of action which is precisely the right course, without our
   knowing why we took it--only that we are led and guided by the Holy
   Spirit into such a track. I believe that this is especially the case
   with the ministry of the Word. I have sometimes been very sharply taxed
   about this matter. I was, a few days ago, upbraided by a good soul for
   exposing all her faults from the pulpit! I have been, not merely now
   and then, but very often thought by some people to be so dreadfully
   personal that they did not know how they could bear it--and yet I never
   saw those people, except from the pulpit, and did not know anything at
   all about them! The Word of God is quick and powerful, and "is a
   discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." When, therefore,
   we ask God to direct us in speaking His Word, it is no marvel that the
   effect is searching! Ah, and did we always, with all our hearts, give
   ourselves up to the motions of His Holy Spirit, we would be led and
   guided in a mysterious manner which we, ourselves, would scarcely
   understand--but it would make full proof of the fact that the "secret
   of the Lord is with them that fear Him."

   I will venture to say that the Christian gets to know more of God, of
   the real Essence of God, by Divine Grace than all the philosophies in
   the world could ever have taught him. I read of God that He is a loving
   Father, that He is gracious towards the children of men. Now, if I fear
   Him with a filial reverence, He disposes me, by His Grace, to love the
   souls of men--He makes me tender and compassionate. Thus I get to
   apprehend, by a devout sympathy, something of what His love, and
   tenderness, and compassion must be. To meditate upon the attributes of
   God is one means of seeking knowledge, but to be conformed to His image
   is quite another way of understanding Him. Not till God makes you like
   Himself can you know what He is! In proportion, then, as we grow in
   Grace, and bring forth the fruits of the Spirit more abundantly, we
   shall be more and more admitted into the secret of the Lord. The day is
   coming, Beloved, when we shall know more of God by our hearts--to say
   nothing of our heads, which probably never will be able to find out the
   Almighty to perfection--we shall know more of God by our hearts than we
   ever thought it possible to know, because our hearts shall be filled
   with Him! Everything obnoxious to Him shall be chased out and we shall
   be like His only-begotten Son, dwelling in His Light and basking in His
   Love forever! "The secret of the Lord," as to His very Character, "is
   with them that fear Him." As they thus go from strength to strength,
   their heart pulsates with a love like the Divine Love. Their souls
   yearn towards sinners with a benevolence like the Divine Benevolence.
   They begin to make sacrifices comparable, in kind, though not in
   degree, to the great Sacrifice of God when He spared not His
   only-begotten Son. Their hearts move. Theirspirits yearn. They cry over
   souls, as God is said to cry over them. "How shall I give you up,
   Ephraim? How shall I make you as Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim?
   My heart is turned within Me; My repentings are kindled together."
   Whenever God would picture Himself to us, He uses words suitable to our
   nature. But oh, how passing wonderful shall it be when God shall be
   seen in us, and we shall see God in ourselves--and so shall see God!
   That blessed promise, "The pure in heart shall see God," is but another
   rendering of our text--"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
   Him." I wish it were in my power to explore this testimony of the Lord
   more fully and expound it more clearly, but for the present I must
   leave these few simple thoughts with you and pass on to observe that we
   have--

   II. A REFERENCE TO A FAVORED CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS.

   A peculiar privilege is conferred on a peculiar people, for it seems
   that the secret of the Lord is with some men, but not with others. Who
   are they who possess this sacred gift? A great outcry has been raised
   in this country of late about class and class interests. In our
   manufacturing districts, particularly, the rights of the upper class,
   who find the capital, and the claims of the working class, who bring
   their skill and labor into the market, are paraded before us in hot
   debates which often lead to an angry lock-out on the part of the
   employers, or a sullen strike on the part of the employed. Such feuds
   seldom bring much credit to either party. A great deal may be said
   concerning some of each to their praise, and not a little concerning
   some of both to their censure. So long as the struggle lasts, it must
   cause much heart-burning. I would the day were come when all this class
   talk was over, that we felt and acknowledged the common ties and mutual
   obligations by which all men depend upon all men--each class being
   dependent for its welfare and prosperity upon each other class, even
   as--"God has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell upon the
   face of the earth." Still, there always will be a favored class. God
   has so ordained it. But let me say they will neither be accepted
   because they are rich, nor rejected because they are poor. The favored
   class before the Lord has nothing to do with any position in society!--

   "None are excluded then, but those, Who do themselves exclude. Welcome
   the learned and polite, The ignorant and rude."

   Neither has this secret of the Lord anything to do with education. It
   is not with every Oxford graduate--it is only with a very few of them!
   The secret of the Lord is not with every Cambridge M.A. nor with every
   man who has taken his degree at any university. You may read the
   Scriptures in the original languages. With Hebrew and Greek you may be
   familiar. Excellent and profitable studies they are, but you cannot
   discover the secret of the Lord by mere classical attainments. No
   mathematical researches or astronomical observation can discover it to
   you. In vain does one mount to Heaven and thread the spheres! Alike in
   vain does another walk the earth and beg the old rocks to tell him what
   happened before Adam held the lease of its broad acres, or tilled its
   soil! No, it is beyond the province of human learning, as it is foreign
   to the privilege of creature rank. Some people think that the secret of
   the Lord is lodged in mystic rites and draped in gorgeous ceremonies.
   There is among us a sect of ritualists who professes to have acquired
   it. They pretend to derive it from some man in lawn sleeves who put his
   hand on their heads! And if they cannot exactly communicate it,
   themselves, yet they can communicate a great deal, for they affirm that
   every little child sprinkled by them becomes, without more ado, a
   member of Christ, a child of God and an inheritor of the Kingdom of
   Heaven! With their guild I have no fellowship--of their weird arts I
   know little. Still, they say it is so--and it is all right with the
   little ones, no doubt, if they die in infancy, for are they not buried
   in consecrated clay? Listen to these gentlemen, these "successors of
   the Apostles," these men who have "gifts" which empower them to declare
   and pronounce absolution and remission of sins! Do you hear the Gospel
   from them? Well you may from some of them, but then they tell you that
   they do not believe in the literal construction of the words they are
   paid to repeat, so they deliberately utter a lie! Or listen to others
   of them. Do they give you the Gospel? No, they display themselves in
   petticoats, embroidered vestments and such apparel as it were unlawful
   to appear in, save only when they are acting in their ecclesiastical
   theatres! You get no Gospel truth from them, nothing but priestcraft
   from beginning to end! Were they honest, they would go at once to
   Babylon, to Rome, to the Mother of Abominations, and consort with their
   own kindred! Thus we say the rite of ordination confers no privileges,
   and restrains no abuses! It does not teach a man the secret of the
   Lord, for the best ordained priest in England may still be as ignorant
   of God, our enemies, themselves, being judges, as if he had never been
   ordained at all.

   To whom, then, is it given to know the secret of the Lord, but to those
   who fear Him and hallow His name? To be conscious that I have sinned,
   to be humbled before God on account of it, to behold Jesus Christ as
   the way of Atonement, to accept Christ as my Savior, to come to God,
   blessing Him that I am saved through His dear Son--to feel a love to
   God because of His Grace to me, to yield up myself to His service, by
   His Holy Spirit to be led to live to His Glory--this it is to fear Him
   and thus it is that His secret is with me! "Why," says one, "then the
   secret of the Lord may be with any poor servant girl!" Bless the Lord
   it may! "Oh, then," says another, "the secret of the Lord may be with
   any humble workman, even though he is an illiterate and uneducated
   man!" Yes, certainly it may! "Then," says yet another, "what becomes of
   the priesthood?" Why, I answer, we are all made priests! If we fear the
   Lord, we are admitted and initiated into the secret mysteries of
   religion--we become instructed in the way of the Lord, the Holy Spirit
   having promised that He will teach us all things, and bring all things
   to our remembrance, whatever Christ has told us. Though we cannot claim
   rank, nor wealth, nor diploma, we can yet humbly say, "The secret of
   the Lord is with us, for He has taught us, by His Grace, how to live
   upon Him, how to trust Him, how to serve Him." "The secret of the Lord
   is with them that fear Him."

   Do you answer to this description, my dear Hearers? Do you walk in the
   fear of the Lord? Says one, "I am a member of a Dissenting Church." I
   do not inquire about that, for it has nothing to do with the secret. Do
   you fear God, I ask you? "Well," says another, "I have always done my
   duty ever since I can remember, from my youth up." That is your duty
   toward man, and it is well that you should never neglect it. But do you
   fear the Lord? Is the Lord the subject of your thoughts, the object of
   your love? And do you, therefore, revere and worship Him? If so, the
   promise is yours and the privilege shall not be withheld from you. "I
   want to know," says one, "which is right among all the contending
   sects." Well, go to the Bible--search the Scriptures--yet not as one
   who is proud of his own wits, but rather as one who fears the Lord
   greatly and inquires at His holy oracle prayerfully. Then, although you
   may not find every knotty point solved, or every quibble settled, you
   shall surely find this saying good, "All your children shall be taught
   of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children." Come to
   the Lord for instruction and there is nothing in His Word which He will
   keep back from you any more than from others, for "the secret of the
   Lord is with them that fear Him." And come to the Lord for guidance and
   you shall not be left in doubt what fellowship of Believers to join,
   for, "it shall come to pass that in what tribe the stranger sojourns,
   there shall you give him his inheritance, says the Lord God." The last
   thing we have to notice is--

   III. THE CHOICE AND PECULIAR MANIFESTATIONS WHICH GOD MAKES TO HIS
   PEOPLE.

   He will show them His Covenant. What a soft, sweet, encouraging
   assurance this Covenant gives us! To see God in Covenant is to find
   Grace in His eyes. To serve a Covenant God is perfect freedom and
   exquisite delight. God out of Christ is a consuming fire. Luther was
   known to say, "I will have nothing to do with an absolute God." The
   fear with which we think of God is all terror, dread and fright--in
   which we exceedingly tremble and quake until He unveils Himself in this
   mellow light of the Covenant of peace! For what could the vision do but
   scare me to destruction? But God, in the Covenant of His dear Son, is
   the hope, the desire, the delight of everyone that is godly--and their
   fear is not that of horror, but that of homage! What, then, does God
   teach His people His Covenant? Much every way. He shows them that His
   Covenant is everlasting. It was made in Christ before the world began.
   It abides steadfast and will forever remain unchangeable. So sure is
   it, that every blessing it provides is unconditional and irrevocable,
   being entailed upon all those who have an interest in its gracious
   provisions! He teaches them the fullness of this Covenant, that it
   contains all that is necessary for the life that now is, and for that
   which is to come. He teaches them the freeness of this Covenant--that
   it was made with them in Christ Jesus, not because of their good works,
   but because of the abounding of His Grace towards them. He teaches them
   that this Covenant is not the result of their tears or vows, their
   penitence or prayer, but that it is the causeof all these--ordered in
   all things and sure, it comprises all that their needs could lack, and
   all that their hearts could crave--it is all their salvation and all
   their desire! The Lord then shows His people that this Covenant was
   made on their behalf. Ah, there is the beauty of it!

   Each one of the blood-bought trophies of mercy is led to see that the
   Covenant was made with David's Lord for him. So each heir of Heaven
   sets to his seal that God is true and makes David's saying his
   own--"Though my house is not so with God, yet He has made with me an
   Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure." He also shows
   His people that this Covenant is made with them by Sacrifice through
   the precious blood of Jesus, wherein God smells a sweet savor of rest.
   No Covenant could be of use to them, except it were a Covenant made
   with blood and based on propitiation.

   They understand that the old Covenant of Works failed because the first
   Adam was not able to carry out his part of it. God spoke to Adam after
   this manner, "If you will be obedient, you and your children shall be
   happy." That, "if," proved fatal. Adam could not observe the condition.
   The Second Covenant is on another footing. It was made with Christ. "If
   You will be obedient, You and those in You shall be blessed." Christ
   was obedient, He kept the Law. He suffered to the death His Father's
   will--and we come, without an, "if," or a, "but," to inherit the
   blessing which Christ has merited for us! Now it is no more, "If you do
   this, I will do that." It is, "You shall do this and I willdo that." "A
   new heart willl give you; and a right spirit willl put within you; you
   shall repent of sin, you shall follow in My ways; you shall love Me;
   you shall serve Me; you shall persevere in holiness; and I will bless
   you." There is not an, "if," nor a, "but," nor a, "perhaps" to foul the
   stream of God's loving kindness! The Covenant was made with every elect
   soul in Christ beyond the hazard of a doubt, and beyond the chance of a
   forfeiture!

   Oh, Soul, has God ever shown you this Covenant? Do I hear anyone murmur
   that it is a horrible Doctrine? Then I am quite certain he has never
   been shown it. Or do I hear another affirm that were he to believe it,
   he would live in sin? I think very likely he would. I do not doubt it.
   To sin is your propensity, whatever you believe! But mind this, I do
   not exhort you to believe in that which has never been revealed to you,
   and has nothing to do with you. But yet another voice greets my ear--it
   is that of a penitent who says--"I come to Christ just as I am. I
   welcome the promise! I thank God there is now nothing left for me to do
   in order to make the promise sure, or to make the Covenant fast! I am a
   poor, lost, undone soul and throw myself at the foot of the bloody
   Cross. I look up to the Savior and say, "Jesus, I trust You to save me.
   I altogether trust You. I believe You have saved me--saved me in such a
   way that I can never be lost, for the Covenant that was made with me
   never can be broken and I shall never be cast away."

   Surely, then, dear Friend, you have no wish to tamper with the lusts of
   the flesh, or to wallow in uncleanness! The Doctrine does not instigate
   you to live in sin! You would be a monster, indeed, if it did! No, you
   will say, "If God has made a Covenant with me, saved me from the curse,
   and endowed me with blessing--out of gratitude to Him, what is there I
   can render to Him for all His benefits? Nothing shall be too hard,
   nothing too heavy--

   "'Lovedd of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn! Chosen of
   Him ere time began, I choose Him in return.'"

   Let slaves go and work under the rod of the taskmaster if they will!
   Let the sons of the bondwoman pour contempt on the inheritance of the
   seed of promise if they like, but a seed shall serve Him, and it shall
   be accounted to the Lord for a generation! The child of God has been
   shown the Covenant--therefore he knows he shall never be cast out of
   the family, for the love of the Father towards him will never change.
   He cannot love us more--He will not love us less. Such love in Him
   begets more love in us. What manner of men ought we to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness! "The secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear Him, and He will show them His Covenant."

   I can only pray that some hearts may be led to look to Jesus, that they
   may discover the choice secret. Christ is not only a party to the
   Covenant and the Representative of the Covenant, but He is the very
   impersonation of the Covenant itself! "I will give Him," says the Lord,
   "To be a Covenant for the people." Oh, if you have looked to Christ,
   you need not despair! He is holy! He is true! He has the key of David
   which can unlock the secret treasury in which are stored all Covenant
   blessings. Fear Him! It is the beginning of wisdom. Trust Him! It is
   the first breath of faith! Desire Him as newborn babies crave milk. Oh,
   that the fear of the Lord may haunt you through the watches of the
   night, and abide with you all the day long. So may the Lord bless you
   now and forever. Amen.

"Accepted in the Beloved"

   (No. 3429)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 19, 1868.

   "Accepted in the Beloved." Ephesians 1:6.

   I SHALL not attempt to do more than simply bring out the Truth of God
   and leave it with you. Fine words and gaudy sentences, with such a text
   as this, would be a vain attempt to "paint the lily and gild refined
   gold." Let this bell ring and there is a depth of silver sweetness in
   it which will make the sanctified ear and heart glad with the fullness
   ofjoy. "Accepted in the Beloved."

   "The Beloved." We all know to whom this refers. Our Lord is the Beloved
   of God. God is Love, and Christ is God. He is One with the Eternal
   Father and we can never tell--it were impossible for us to guess--what
   love there is between the Father and the Son, in their essential Deity.
   Jesus is the Beloved of angels. It is their joy to sing praise unto
   "Him who was, and is, and is to come." He is the Beloved of all the
   white-robed band who have washed those robes in His blood and who sing,
   "Unto Him that has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His blood,
   to Him be glory." He is the Beloved of His saints, who are still
   wayfaring and warfaring here below. To Him their highest affections
   gather. He is dearer to them than all besides, "the chief among ten
   thousand, and the altogether lovely." "The Beloved." Not only Beloved,
   but, "the Beloved." This is a name for all the saints--"beloved"--for
   as John the Divine often writes in his Epistles, "Beloved, now are we
   the sons of God." All the family are beloved, but Christ, the Elder
   Brother, is "the Beloved." He is especially beloved, the choicest, the
   Chief, who in this has the preeminence. How many times did God testify
   concerning Him that He was "the Beloved," when He said, "This is my
   Beloved Son." These waters of Baptism remind us of the scene on
   Jordan's banks, when the Holy Spirit bore witness that He was the
   Beloved Son of God. In later life, even in the depths of His
   humiliation, the Father testified that this was the Beloved Son. To us,
   the saints, He is our Beloved Spouse. We sing of Him, as the song has
   it, even "the Song of Songs which is Solomon's," "My Beloved is mine,
   and I am His." We delight to think of Him under that title, under which
   the Church of God of old addressed Him. He is Beloved in all His
   offices to us, Beloved in all His Characters, Beloved in the manger,
   Beloved in the shame and spitting, Beloved on the Cross, Beloved on the
   Throne! We cannot think of Him without our heart beginning to beat high
   and fast--

   "He has engrossed my warmest love, No earthly charms my soul can move,
   I have a mansion in His heart, Nor death nor Hell can make us part."

   Of all the titles that are given to Christ, there may be some that
   excel in splendor, and others in sublimity, but surely this is among
   the chief for sweetness and expressiveness! It has the finger which
   touches our heart strings. "The Beloved."

   But now to the text. And the first thing I think I see in the text is
   that "the Beloved" is accepted of God. The second thing I see is that
   the saints are "in the Beloved." And the third thing, that the saints
   are "acceptedin the Beloved." It is clear in the text that "the
   Beloved" is--

   I. ACCEPTED OF GOD.

   It will delight you if you try in meditation to get a hold of this
   thought, of how infinitely acceptable Christ must be to God the Father.
   All other forms of acceptance must have their limit and boundary--but
   the acceptability of the Son of God to the First Person of the Blessed
   Trinity must be altogether beyond either bottom or shore!

   "The Beloved" must be acceptable to God in His own Person. Is He not
   God, Himself, and how should it be that one Person in the Indivisible
   Unity should be otherwise than acceptable to the other? He is also Man,
   but He is Man born after a wondrous birth. "The Son of the Highest."
   The Holy Spirit overshadowed the Virgin Mother. In His Godhead and in
   His Manhood, united as Mediator, He stands supreme in His Person. As
   Saul was head and shoulders above all the rest of the men of Israel, so
   has the Lord "anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His fellows."
   Who can be likened to Him in Person? Beauty, where can you draw, if
   your fancy shall take all its range, anything that shall be comparable
   to Him? Designer of all things, the Most High God, "Wonderful, The
   Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of
   Peace." What acceptance must there be in such an One as He is to the
   Most High God! You know that sometimes, in the sending of ambassadors,
   it is well to calculate whether the person chosen to be an ambassador
   will be adoptable to the foreign court. Now if he is a man of mean
   origin, a man ill-esteemed at home, it will be an insult to send him as
   an ambassador to another country. But if he is a man eminent and
   distinguished, admirable and admired, a man of high standing with his
   own Court, then he is the very person to represent the sovereignty of
   his country at another Court. See, then, what kind of Representative we
   have to send up to the Father's Courts in Heaven--One who, while He is
   "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh," is, nevertheless, "God over
   all, blessed forever." My Soul, what better Ambassador could you have?
   To whom could you entrust your concerns one half as well as to One so
   inconceivably excellent, so superlatively blessed? He is, then,
   acceptable in His Person!

   And then, secondly, to God He is equally acceptable in His Character.
   God is perfectly pure. He cannot bear the slightest trace of sin--and
   Jesus is "holy, harmless, and undefiled, and separate from sinners."
   God cannot look upon sin, as it is abhorrent to His Nature, but He can
   look upon Christ, for "in Him was no sin." "The prince of this world
   comes," says He, "but has nothing on Me." "God is Love," and to be
   acceptable with God in Character, one must be full of love. Now Jesus
   is such! Was there ever One who had such pity on the ignorant and such
   "compassion on those that are out of the way"? Was there ever such a
   tender heart elsewhere as that which glowed in the Master's bosom and
   gleamed from His loving eyes? He was a mass of love! He was Love
   performing and Love suffering. Love made Him live as He did and love
   made Him die as He did! And love still pervades His Nature--now that He
   lives on high, still loving the sons of men. Since God is Love, then,
   and Christ is full of love, His Character is suitable to God. You shall
   not find anything in Christ Jesus that does not conform with the
   God-like and the Divine. See Him where you will, He is humble, meek and
   lowly--but He is still august and sublime. Even when He puts on the
   garb of the peasant, "woven from the top throughout," that garment
   shrouds the Deity and befits Him better than the purple robe befits
   Caesar on the throne! If He distributes alms, or says, "I thirst." If
   He is tempest-tossed on the Sea of Galilee, if He rebukes the waves, if
   He feels Himself willing to die where man's suffering and weakness is
   most apparent, yet there is it most consistent with the Character of
   God, for the Centurion, who stood beholding, said, "Certainly this was
   the Son of God." There is something congruous in the Nature of Christ
   to the Character of God and, therefore, His Character is always
   acceptable to the Most High.

   Then, my Brothers and Sisters, God loves that which is incorruptible.
   Now our Savior was often tried, but He was never corrupted! He was
   tempted and bribed with the offer of a kingdom and, again, threatened
   with all the wrath of men--but He never started aside for a single
   moment from the straight line of integrity! His whole life was so pure,
   that although God "charges His angels with folly, and the heavens are
   not pure in His sight," yet in Jesus He sees no folly and no
   imperfection! He, even suffering as Savior, is pure, infinitely pure
   and incorruptible in the sight of God! So, Beloved, the Character of
   Christ is altogether acceptable to God, as well as His Person.

   We may go a step further and say that the motive of Christ, as well as
   His outward Character, must have been infinitely acceptable to God. The
   motive of Jesus Christ, in coming here below, was altogether unselfish.
   "Though He was rich," and had nothing to gain, "yet for our sakes He
   became poor, that we" (not Himself) "through His poverty might be made
   rich." It can truly be said of Him, "He saved others. Himself He could
   not save." "Being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself and
   became obedient unto death." He emptied Himself out for us, and all out
   of pure love to those who had no love to Him--out of disinterested
   affection to those whose best return is but a feeble thanks, for what
   can such poor worms as we ever render at our very best for "love so
   amazing, so Divine"? Well does Dr. Watts say in one of our best hymns--

   "Words are but air, and tongues but clay, But Your compassion is
   Divine."

   Savior! You could have no motive to move You but that which is pure,
   and high, and lofty! Cleansed from everything like self, Jesus came
   that He might honor the Justice of God. He would have man saved, but in
   such a way as not to derogate from the Justice of the Most High. He
   would have no spots upon God's Law, no slur upon the Divine Character
   and, there, as He kneels amidst the olives of Gethsemane, or there, as
   He staggers beneath the Cross, or there, as He gives His hands to the
   nails and His feet to the cruel iron, He is vindicating the Eternal
   Justice and severity of God by His labors, by His griefs and by His
   Sacrifice of Himself to death! He must, then, moved by a motive so high
   as this, have been infinitely acceptable to Heaven!

   He was, then, acceptable in His Person, acceptable in His Character and
   acceptable in His inner motive from which that outward Character
   sprang! And He was also acceptable in all His work which He did on
   Earth. Cast your eyes along that work for a minute. In the first part
   of His life that work was active. In the second part and also in the
   first, there was a passive work being carried on. There was an active
   work of obedience to the Father's will. And what obedience it was!
   Never for a moment asking to be excused from a command, or to have a
   release from the sacred Sacrifice--it was always work with all His
   heart, till He could say, "The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up."--

   "Such was Your truth and such Your zeal, Such deference for Your
   Father's will. Such love andmeetness so Divine, I would transcribe and
   make them mine." The whole life of is the paragon of perfection, the
   mirror in which every virtue is reflected! He could not be otherwise
   than acceptable to God in the active righteousness of His life. And
   when we come to His passive righteousness, what shall

   1 say of that? Track Him, my Brothers and Sisters, to the Garden and
   hear Him say, "Not as I will, but as You will." Watch Him before
   Pilate, when He obeys God by keeping silent, and "like a sheep before
   her shearers, He opened not His mouth." Follow Him then, and behold Him
   on the Cross and note how careful He is that the Scriptures may be
   ful-filled--how still, with whole-hearted consecration, He never starts
   back for a moment from the paying of the great ransom price which was
   to deliver His people from eternal bondage! There cannot be any doubt
   in your minds, but that the blessed Advocate and Surety of our souls
   must be accepted before the Lord--in the height, and depth, and length,
   and breadth of an acceptance that we can scarcely understand when we
   see Him giving up all the floods of His life, pouring them out like
   water before the Lord! In Person, in Character, in motive, in work,
   Jesus Christ is infinitely accepted!

   Now that He was so accepted is not only clearly to be seen by these
   reflections, but the fact is proved by this, that the Father raised Him
   from the dead! He saw no corruption, but He must have remained in the
   tomb, or the work had not been finished. He was "justified in the
   Spirit by the Resurrection from the dead." His acceptance of God was
   proved when God brought Him from the dead! So, too, His ascending. His
   ascending up on high and leading captivity captive proves that He was
   accepted! His admission into Heaven proves that He was accepted! His
   sitting at the right hand of the Father proves that He has finished the
   work! And His present reigning over all the world in His mediatorial
   government is the reward of His sufferings--and His Second Advent, for
   which we look with devout anticipation--is to be a yet fuller
   declaration that He is "the Beloved" of God, and infinitely acceptable
   in the Father's sight!

   Thus much, a few stirrings, as it were, of the surface of this great
   sea touching, as a swallow does, the waves. I have given you but these
   few hints. Think them over. And now, and very briefly-- II. ALL
   BELIEVERS ARE IN CHRIST "ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED."

   They are "in the Beloved," then, or in Christ. How are Believers in
   Christ? They are in Christ as their Representative. Just as the whole
   human race was in the loins of Adam, so the whole elect people were in
   the loins of Christ. It is said by the Apostle, "Levi was in the loins
   of Abraham when Melchisedec met him." So were all of us in the loins of
   Jesus Chr-ist--always there in Him, for is it not written, "He shall
   see His seed"? And we are His seed! We spring in our new life from Him.
   He is the corn of wheat which was cast into the ground to die, that it
   might not abide alone, and now it brings forth much fruit. We are in
   Christ as the branch is in the vine, as the stone is in the building.
   We are in Christ as the members are in the head. He represents us. When
   we talk of counting heads, we mean counting the whole body, so Christ,
   the Head, represents all the members and He stands for us. We were in
   Christ, Beloved, according to the words of the Holy Spirit--we were in
   Christ in our election, "according as He has chosen us in Him." There
   is a personal election of every child of God, but that personal
   election is connected with Christ--

   "Christ is My first elect, He said,

   Then chose our souls in Christ our Head."

   We were in Christ in the suretyship engagements of the eternal
   Covenant. What Christ spoke before the world was, He spoke as for us.
   His prescient eye foresaw our existence, foreknew our ruin. He espoused
   us unto Himself, then, and stood in the Council Chambers of Eternity,
   the Surety and Sponsor of His people's souls!

   We are in Christ, according to Scripture, by judicial dealing.That is
   to say, God deals with Christ as if He were dealing with us. "Awake, O
   sword"--against whom? Against the sinning sheep? No, "against the
   Shepherd, against the Man who is My Fellow, says the Lord." "For the
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are
   healed." "All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned,
   everyone, to his own way, and the Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity
   of us all." In Him in the choice, in Him in the Covenant, and then in
   Him in God's dealings with Christ as a Judge!

   So now, further, blessed be His name, we are in Him by a vital union.
   There is a living unity between Christ and His people, as between the
   husband and the wife, as between the branch and the stem. We are one
   with Him by vital union. Have you realized this, Believer? Do you seek
   to live as one that is one with Jesus? Do you try to act as one that
   has learned his unity to the heavenly One, to the Second Adam? It is
   so. If you have believed, you are one with Him!

   And we are one with Him by a fixed decree of God that never shall be
   broken. "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
   Jesus our Lord?" Who shall tear one limb from the sacred body of Jesus?
   Who shall cut away one truly quickened branch from that celestial vine?
   He preserves those who are in Him! He covers us with His feathers and
   under His wings do we trust--His truth is our shield and buckler! You
   may divide and you must divide the dearest bonds of earth, but you
   shall never cut the knot that was tied in old eternity, which bound
   Christ to His people. "I in them, and they in Me, that they may be
   perfect in one." There shall never come a time when He will be ashamed
   to call them brethren, and never to one of them whom the Father has
   given Him shall there come a time when they shall refuse to call Him
   Master and Lord. We are "in" Him, then!

   Now this is a great mystery. The Apostle always speaks of it as such.
   But it is one of the most blessed mysteries in the whole compass of
   Revelation. Dear Friend, never forget that God does not deal with you
   as an individual--He deals with you as in Christ. If you stood as an
   individual, you would perish, for you will be sure to fall. You are so
   weak and frail and apt to sin, that with the best resolutions and
   intentions, you would be sure to turn aside and, therefore, the blessed
   Father has put you in a safer place--He has put you in Christ! And now
   your interests are Christ's interests. As I have often told you, you
   cannot drown a man's foot unless you can drown his head--and if our
   Head is in Heaven, we are safe. And He, our Head, is there! When your
   vessel tosses in the storm, you may hear a voice that says, "Fear not,
   the boat is safe; you carry Jesus and all His fortune." Christ is one
   with His people--they must sink or swim together. Has He not, Himself,
   said it, "Because I live, you shall live also"? The saint, then, is
   "in" Him. Now we come to the full text, and that is, that--

   III. THE SAINTS ARE "ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED."

   Their persons are accepted. You know there are some persons that are
   not acceptable to you. You would sooner live in Heaven with them,
   forever, than you would like to live a quarter of an hour with them on
   earth! There are some people of that kind to whom we take a very
   natural objection. And I suppose it is not possible, although we would
   treat them always with kindness and so on, that we would ever desire
   them as companions. They are not acceptable to us. And now it does seem
   amazing that we, who have not any personal recommendation, but very
   much in us that might render us obnoxious to God, are nevertheless
   acceptable in our persons, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Yes, you with
   no talents, you with no wealth, no position, no great friends--you who
   can do so little when you do your best--you, though the garment you
   wear is not of the finest, but of the very lowliest material, are
   acceptable to God! God looks not according to the outward appearance,
   but He looks to the heart. And whenever He sees a simple trust in
   Jesus, which is a token of our being in Jesus, our person is acceptable
   to Him because, you see, He does not look at us as we are, but He looks
   at us through Christ! He looks through the wounds of Jesus upon us poor
   sinners, as a verse of one of our hymns runs--

   "He in them the sinner sees, Looks through Jesus' wounds on me."

   If one of you were away now in India, and after you had been living
   there for years, you saw a person very poor and ragged, who
   nevertheless said, "I used to be a servant to your mother," why, it
   would bring such recollections of thatcountry homestead and of the dear
   old times when you were one of the happy family, that I am sure your
   heart would be touched and though there might be no reason whatever in
   the person why you should relieve him, yet because of his connection
   with that dear name of mother, perhaps in Heaven, you would put your
   hand into your purse at once! Now God sees such a connection between us
   and Christ that He esteems us for Christ's sake! "My Son loved that
   man," He says. "My Son died for that woman. My Son on the tree laid
   down His life for that poor, humble, penitent one. I love him for My
   Son's sake." Now will you try and get a hold, if you can, by faith,
   that sweet thought, that your person--you, you yourself, are accepted
   before God in the Beloved this night--and although you cannot accept
   yourself, but find much to complain of, yet, still, if you are in
   Jesus, you are--

   "So near, so very near to God,

   You cannot nearer be!

   For in the Person of His Son,

   You are as near as He.

   So dear, so very dear to God,

   You cannot dearer be--

   The love wherewith He loves His Son,

   Such is His love to thee!" "Such is His love to me," you may say.

   Now, because the person is accepted, the next thing is our prayers and
   praises are "accepted in the Beloved." We sometimes kneel down to pray,
   but we cannot pray. Those that use a book and bring God dead prayers
   can always be alike, but that which comes from the heart varies--and
   there are times with living prayers when the most you can do is to
   groan. A sigh, a sob, is the most you can get out. But a mother would
   sooner hear her own child sob than another child sing. There is music
   about that dear child's voice that moves her heart and touches her
   spirit. And so the inward meanings of a broken heart are music in the
   ears of the Infinite Jehovah, and He accepts the sincere prayers of His
   people, let them be as broken as they may! And as for our praise, well,
   we do not always sing our praises--we feel them, we talk them, and when
   we do sing them, our voices are not, perhaps, as sweet as we would
   desire. Never mind. Our Lord does not judge our hymns by the same tests
   as gentlemen of musical tastes would do! He hears the ring of the heart
   and if that is right, there may be a false note or two, perhaps, in the
   voice, but if the right note is in the heart, the praises are accepted,
   and the prayers are, "accepted in the Beloved," for our prayers do not
   come up before God as they are. It is with us, as it is with some poor
   men. They want to get up a petition. They come, perhaps, to us. They
   want us to petition to some great man for some help. "Well, write our
   your petition." They bring it. "Oh," we say, "it will never do to send
   that--here is this word spelt wrong, that sentence is ungrammatical.
   You have not addressed him at all in the right style. Come, I will take
   it, and I will make a fair copy of it for you, and send that with my
   name appended. It may have some weight." So does Christ do with us. He
   takes our poor blotted and blurred prayers and He just re-writes them,
   and then He presents them to His Father's Throne. He takes the incense
   we bring and puts it into His own golden censor. He puts in the coals
   of fire and then, as He swings that censer to and fro in His own
   Priesthood before the Throne of God, your prayers and mine, your
   praises and mine, smoke like sweet perfume before the Presence of the
   Most High, "accepted inthe Beloved."

   And, Brothers and Sisters, just so is it with all the work we do for
   Christ and all the gifts we bring. It happens on Sunday, perhaps,
   sometimes when the bread is bought and the supply got in for the
   family, that you have very little to give. "Well, here is a penny for
   the Orphanage." You must give God something, you think. You would give
   Him more if you could. You only wish you had tens of thousands of
   pounds you could give. Well, it is very little, and nobody knows who
   gives it, still, it is "accepted in the Beloved." If it is given for
   His sake, I tell you that every penny is "accepted in the Beloved."
   Does not the Lord say so? The two mites that make a farthing, which
   were the widow's living, were so accepted that He could not help
   speaking about them--and publishing to all the world in this Book, the
   Bible, to be handed down throughout all time--as long as there shall be
   a Bible in the Christian Church! The other night you talked with a
   little child, or you gave away a tract. You tried to do something--to
   lead someone to Christ. Well, that was all "accepted in the Beloved."
   You did it with a single eye to God's Glory. You thought you did it
   very badly and that therewas much imperfection mingled with it--but
   Christ washed it all--and when it was all fair and clean, He presented
   it and it was accepted!

   And here is a mercy (I will add only one other word to this line of
   thought)--the whole life of the Christian, so far as it is the
   outgrowth of the life within, is "acceptedin the Beloved." That morning
   you awoke, when the heart rose up in prayer for keeping during the day.
   That bended knee at the bedside, when the soul commits itself to the
   Father of Spirits. That family gathering, when the prayer is offered
   that the household may be kept during the day. That blessing at the
   eating of bread. That thankful heart to God, when the morning's meal is
   finished. Those brief sudden prayers during the business of the day.
   That word put in for Christ when the conversation ran the other way.
   That thankful return home at night. That evening prayer. That lifting
   up of the soul to God in thankfulness to carry you through another
   day--all that, the humblest part of it, was all "accepted in the
   Beloved." Brothers and Sisters, it is very, very delightful to think
   that if I preach a sermon for Christ it is accepted, but I want you to
   think that if you housewives are about the house, doing your business
   there for your husband and children, you are as much accepted there as
   I am when I am preaching! That Prayer Meeting was very acceptable. Yes,
   and I know how acceptable it was when you sat up that night with a sick
   man. It was done for Jesus' sake. The man who addresses thousands is
   accepted, but he that sits down and talks, even to a little child, is
   just as much accepted, and accepted in the same way, too, for it is
   only "in the Beloved" that either the big or the little can be at all!
   The bullock was offered and God accepted it. The kid was offered and
   God accepted that. And the reason was because they were both put upon
   the same altar, and both burnt with the same fire. Christ is the Altar,
   and Christ the Fire--and so our sacrifices are "accepted in the
   Beloved."

   I think these words were the favorite words of that dear man of God,
   Mr. Harrington Evans, "Accepted in the Beloved." He used to often
   repeat them in his sermons and, if I remember rightly, when he was
   dying and his deacons needed a message to be given to the Church, to
   let them know what was the state of mind of their pastor at the time of
   death, he said, "Go and tell them I am accepted in the Beloved." Oh,
   dear Hearer can you say this? There is more eloquence in these words
   than in all the eloquence of Demosthenes, or in all the glowing periods
   of Caesar! To say, "I am accepted in the Beloved," is better than to be
   able to say, "I am the owner of the Indies, or the possessor of the
   world." "Accepted in the Beloved." Remember, there is many a religious
   person who is not "accepted in the Beloved," for the moralists, the
   religionists that like not Christ, are not accepted! They pray, and
   they read the Scriptures, and they attend their place of worship. They
   are baptized--they come to the altar--but it is all nothing if they do
   not come to Christ! All these things are nothing to any of them if they
   are not in Christ. We hold that we should baptize none but those who
   profess their belief in Christ. And it seems to us that apart from a
   saving faith in Christ, it is a mere mockery--and if given to children,
   or even to an unconverted person--it is more likely to make them think
   there is efficacy in the sacrament than to do them any kind of good.
   Thus we would have you touch nothing at the Lord's Table until you have
   first come to Jesus. Then the Baptism--and then the Lord's Table will
   be profitable helps to you in remembering Christ, and you will be
   accepted in them, "in the Beloved." But you must get "in" Him first,
   for Baptism is nothing, and the Lord's Supper nothing, without Christ!
   First, you must get the Substance, and then the shadow will follow. And
   these things are only shadows--they only set forth the Substance! And
   if any come to the shadow, tonight, who have not got the Substance,
   they have no business to come and on their heads will be the guilt. We
   must first be in Him. Whether you are an open sinner or outwardly
   moral, remember you are not accepted, otherwise, for it is not your
   conduct, not your outward life that will do apart from Christ. It is
   union to Christ--and faith brings us that! A simple trust in Jesus, and
   we are "in" Jesus and "accepted in" Jesus! But without that, we are
   "without Christ, without hope, and alien from the commonwealth of
   Israel."

   The Lord bless this simple meditation to His people, and His shall be
   the praise forever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EPHESIANS1; 2:1.

   Verses 1, 2. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to
   the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
   Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
   Christ. He wishes them Divine Grace, first, and peace afterwards, which
   is the right and natural order. There is no lasting peace without
   Grace.

   There is no peace worth having which does not spring from a work of
   Grace in the soul. "Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and
   from the Lord Jesus Christ."

   3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ How dear the
   Father is when we view Him in association with the Redeemer. Never do
   the saints seem to delight so much in God as when they behold Him in
   the Person of Jesus Christ. Then is He inexpressibly lovely to us and
   we preach Him with joy and delight. "Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ."

   3. Who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places
   in Christ "Blessed," says he, "be God, who has blessed us." Well may we
   bless Him with our feeble thanks who has blest us with His mighty
   mercies! Nothing makes a man bless God like God's blessing him! "He has
   blessed us," says the Apostle, "with all spiritual blessings." The
   children of God have not only some blessings, but all they need! They
   are all theirs-- for all time and for all eternity--but they are all in
   Christ. There is no blessing out of Christ. All the fullness of
   blessing dwells in Jesus and in Him only! And if you would be blessed,
   you must come to Christ for a blessing. He has "blest us with all
   spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."

   4. According as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love. The
   first great blessing of the Covenant of Grace is our election. We were
   chosen, but chosen in Christ--chosen not because we were holy, but
   chosen that we should be holy! The great objective of the Divine choice
   is our holiness. And let no man say that He is chosen of God unless God
   is working in Him to this Divine end, namely, holiness of character!

   5. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.After
   election comes adoption. Men are not by nature the children of
   God--they are heirs of wrath. And this is very clear because a man
   never adopts his own children. But adoption in itself proves that by
   nature we are not the children of God--He adopts us. "Then are you
   begotten again unto a lively hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead." Happy they who know the adoption--who feel in
   themselves the spirit of children and can cry, "Abba, Father," as they
   look up to God tonight! This is in Christ Jesus, for nothing comes to
   us except by Him.

   6. To the praise of the glory of His Grace, wherein He has made us
   accepted in the beloved. Christ is so acceptable to God that that
   acceptance is sufficient to spread over all those who are in Him. And
   tonight every Believer here is accepted before God, but it is through
   Jesus Christ. Do notice that! Nothing comes but by that silver pipe.
   "He has made us accepted in the Beloved."

   7. In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
   sins, according to the riches of His Grace. Redemption by Christ,
   forgiveness by Christ, still everything through the Crucified! Those
   dear wounds of His are the five sacred founts from which a world of
   blessing flows to bless poor needy sinners. Well may we say, "None but
   Christ," for, indeed, there is none but Christ who can bless us!

   8-10. Wherein He has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence.
   Having made known unto us the mystery of His will, according to His
   good pleasure which He has purposed in Himself: That in the
   dispensation of the fullness of times He might gather together in one,
   all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth:
   even in Him. All the things that are in Christ are to be gathered
   together--believing Jews no longer to be divided from believing
   Gentiles. Today the Church of God is separated--disfigured and weakened
   by divers sects and parties, but it shall not be always so. There is a
   gathering under the Christ and He will, in the fullness of time,
   perfectly accomplish it.

   11, 12. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
   predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works all things
   after the counsel of His own will: That we should be to the praise of
   His glory, who first trusted in Christ Some people are dreadfully
   frightened at that word, "predestination." I am always astonished when
   members of the Church of England are so, for if they will turn to their
   own Articles, they will find that the high and comfortable Doctrine of
   Predestination is taught there. It is to be wisely handled, but it is
   not to be gagged and sent into a corner, as it is by some. Are there
   Truths in Scripture that are not to be taught? If any say so, then I
   charge them with being like the Jesuit who hides a part of what he
   believes! No, the whole of God's Truth is to be declared, and whatever
   we find in this Book, that are we to state! The keeping back of
   precious Truths of God will be required of such as are guilty of it at
   the Last Great Day.

   13-23; Chapter 2:1. In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the
   word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
   you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, Which
   is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
   possession, unto the praise of His glory. Therefore I also, after I
   heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints,
   cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:
   That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give
   unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him:
   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know
   what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of
   His inheritance in the saints, And what is the exceeding greatness of
   His power to us who believe, according to the working of His mighty
   power Which He worked in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and
   set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places. Far above all
   principality, and power and might and dominion, and every name that is
   named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. And
   has put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all
   things to the Church, Which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills
   all in all And you has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
   sins. So that what He did for Christ, He has done for you! He raised
   Him and He has raised you. And having begun thus to quicken you, He
   will go on to lift you up and to exalt you till you sit with Him upon
   His Throne!

   The only question, dear Friends, is this--Do we belong to those of whom
   Paul here speaks? We look to the first verse to see who they are and we
   find he is addressing the faithful in Christ Jesus. That is, those who
   are believing in Christ Jesus. If we are believing in Him, then all the
   privileges which are mentioned in this Chapter belong to us and we are
   quickened--and we shall be exalted even as Christ is, at the Father's
   right hand! So be it, gracious Lord!

Chiding and Cheering

   (No. 3430)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Have I been with you so long, and yet have you not known Me, Philip?"
   John 14:9.

   THIS Chapter gives us a very delightful picture of the companionship
   and kindly conversation which were kept up between our Savior and His
   12 disciples when He dwelt with them in this world. Though they looked
   up to Him as if they felt there was none upon earth beside Him, yet
   they were as simple and free in speaking to Him as if they merely
   talked to one another. And did not He behave to them like a true
   friend, always mindful of their childishness, but gentle, tender, and
   patient? Warning without wounding, correcting without much censure, and
   comforting them without concealing the dangers to which they were
   exposed? Thus we notice how they speak to Him with a natural, easy
   familiarity. And He talks to them in full sympathy with their weakness,
   teaching them little by little as they are able to learn. They ask just
   such questions as a boy might ask of his father. Often they show their
   ignorance, but never do they seem timid in His Presence, or ashamed to
   let Him see how shallow and hard of understanding they are. Yet He is
   never petulant with them. Even though He would chide them for their
   dullness, His rebukes are not harsh. Thus, when Philip says to Him,
   "Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us," Jesus answers him with a
   question which quietly rebukes his simplicity-- "Have I been with you
   so long, and yet have you not known Me, Philip?" What lenience, what
   compassion! "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him." Oh, how should the children of such a Father cling
   to His knees, sit at His feet, hang on His lips and pour out their
   hearts before Him! Such, Beloved, was the demeanor that Jesus loved to
   exhibit towards His disciples! And such was the behavior that He liked
   to encourage on their part towards Himself. As there were no chills in
   that friendliness of His, so there could hardly be much shyness or
   backwardness in those conversations of theirs. I linger on the picture.
   He, on whose brow majestic sweetness reigns, is all generous,
   condescending and, I might almost say, He is affable, while they, poor
   in spirit, weak in faith, grow open and ingenuous, confidential and
   confiding in His society. Language fails me to describe to you what I
   see in the text and its surroundings. Here is the Man, Christ Jesus,
   Divine in His Person, in His Character and in His conduct, unveiling
   the Father to babes in Grace who do not and cannot understand the charm
   that first drew them and then bound them to Him! But He who once
   sojourned here below, now sits exalted high at the right hand of God.
   In bodily Presence He is not among us. He is not to be seen by mortal
   eyes, yet in spirit He abides with us and His Presence is known and
   felt by gracious hearts. Believe me, then, He is the same Jesus! He is
   by no means changed. The terms on which He would have us live with Him
   and walk with Him are far above mere service. He calls us "friends."
   Why, do you think He does that? Is it because we have done so much for
   Him? No, it is because He has done so much for us, and told us so much,
   and kept nothing back from us! In truth, He is our Friend and
   Counselor, and He would have us come to Him and ask His advice in the
   most frank and simple manner. When we feel that we lack wisdom, He
   never upbraids us, but He always gives liberally to those who ask Him.
   We may play the child with Him--He deigns to be pleased with our
   childish prattle. Our prayers may be full of inquiries. Our
   supplications may be laden with difficulties that we cannot unravel.
   Yet He will condescend to explain them all, and by His Spirit He will
   continue to teach and lead us further into the Truth of God. Oh, how I
   wish we always cultivated this childlike spirit towards Jesus, for He
   always has a compassionate spirit towards us!

   What dull scholars we all are! "Have I been with you so long, and yet
   have you not known Me?" These words suggest two redactions, on each of
   which I shall have a few remarks to offer. First, notwithstanding the
   highest privileges that can be enjoyed in obtaining instruction, we may
   yet remain ignorant of Jesus Christ And secondly, when we do know Him,
   the most favored disciples have still much to learn. So far as our
   religious training is concerned--

   I. THE BEST OF MEN CANNOT IMPART TO US A KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST.

   Here were Apostles who had been with Jesus, Himself, for three years in
   His public labors and in His private retirement. They had been, as it
   were, students in His college--He Himself had been their Tutor. They
   could not have been placed in more advantageous circumstances! No
   better tutor could have been found. He taught them both by His works
   and by His words. He was constantly doing miracles and performing
   wondrous actions, by which He showed His Glory and revealed His Nature.
   But there were some of them that, after all this teaching, did not
   know--did not know what? Why, they did not know Hm! They did not know
   the main point of all His teaching. They did not know the Teacher,
   Himself! He had been so long with them, and yet they did not know Him!
   I am not now, in this first part of our discourse, alluding so much to
   Philip, whose knowledge was imperfect, his light but a glimmer and his
   thoughts, therefore, often perplexed, as I am to Judas Iscariot. The
   career of that unhappy man--his calling, his course, his character, his
   conduct, his crime and the consequences of his crime--all conspire to
   produce a picture on which we gaze with wild amazement! And as we
   ponder it, we feel a sinking at the inmost heart. It shows us how near
   a man may be to Christ in the daily walks of life. How much he may see
   of Christ in His works of mercy toward the children of men, and how
   often he may hear of Christ the words of counsel and comfort, of wisdom
   and warning-- and yet be totally ignorant of Christ, deriving no virtue
   from Him, entering into no sympathy with Him--till at length he falls
   away to perish with an awful, terrible destruction! Or, to make the
   peril more thoroughly our own, it would appear that we might associate
   with the followers of Christ in our homes, have constantly before our
   eyes the charities which are dispensed in the name of Christ, and be
   privileged to listen to the most enlightened and eloquent preachers of
   Christ--and yet never discern Him as the Son of God, sent of the
   Father, the very essence and quintessence of the Covenant of Grace! His
   name may be most familiar to our ears, while, alas, our hearts are
   alien to Him! Had Judas known his Master more truly, could he have
   dealt Him so treacherously? Had He known Christ to be One with the
   Father, would he have sold Him for 30 pieces of silver? Had he known
   Him to be "God over all, blessed forever," would he have betrayed Him
   to the chief priests? Oh, no! Though he had seen Him tread the sea and
   heard the voice that called back Lazarus from the tomb, yet Judas saw
   only the man, the Nazarene, whom he could sell and give over
   traitorously to His foes! Certainly he did not so know Jesus as to
   trust Him--he had never yielded up his soul to rely upon the Messiah,
   the Christ, the Appointed, the Anointed Savior. Judas was pre-eminently
   one who, though he had been a long time with Christ, yet knew Him not
   in the matter of saving faith. And I am sure he did not know Him so as
   to love Him. If he had loved Him, he would not have deceived Him, or
   given Him the traitorous kiss. Learn, then, from Judas' example, rather
   than from Philip's, just now, that you and I may have been hearers of
   the Word for years and yet may not know Jesus!

   Oh, but if we do know Him, let us be very grateful that the Holy Spirit
   has taught us something of His sacred mission! How much more, if you
   have been made acquainted with the dignity and excellence of His
   Person, and confessed Him to be the Son of God! What thanks will you
   then render unto the Father? Remember what Christ said to Simon Peter
   when he proved that he knew Him beyond all the rumors that were
   floating about, beyond all the opinions that were entertained, beyond
   all the prejudices that were nursed among the rulers or the people of
   those days. He said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and
   blood have not revealed this unto you, but My Father who is in Heaven."
   No minister can make us know Christ! No book, no, not even the Bible,
   itself, apart from this celestial teaching! So Paul prays "that the God
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the
   Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of
   your understanding being enlightened." This will make Jesus Christ in
   the Deity of His Person, in the excellence of His work, in the love of
   His heart, in the faithfulness of His Character, to be truly known by
   us, so that we shall trust Him implicitly and love Him undividedly! I
   do beg to press this very earnestly upon many of you here present. The
   question of our text has a strong admonition, when set in this light,
   for some of you. Has not Jesus been, as it were, a long time with you,
   you who are regular attendants at this place of worship? Ah, you have
   discerned His Presence by the words spoken and the signs worked in your
   midst. When we have preached the Gospel earnestly and faithfully, with
   the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven, as at least we sometimes have
   preached it, then Jesus has come very near to you--often and often has
   He pleaded with you--you have felt a Presence greater than that of man
   while His Truth has been declared. "Has He been with you so long, and
   yet have you not known Him?" That He has been with you is certain, for
   His saints bear witness of Him. While you have been sitting on these
   seats, there have been all around you gracious hearts that have
   rejoiced because they have seen the Savior! Sorrowing hearts have been
   relieved of many cares, and weeping eyes whose tears have been wiped
   away. The presence of Jesus has made the heartstrings of many here to
   sound like harps of joy! Has He been with you so long, near unto you,
   seen by your neighbors and yet have you notknown Him? Oh, poor souls!
   Poor Philip! Poor John! Poor Mary who could sit in such an assembly
   where others saw the Savior, and yet not to have known Him! Moreover,
   Jesus has been here, for many like you haveseen Him. Perhaps your own
   wife has been converted. Your brother has seen the Lord. Your sister
   has come to know Christ as her Savior. And so long has He been with you
   that now you could count some dozen or more of your companions that
   have come to know Jesus, yet you have not known Him! Oh, it is hard to
   live where Divine Grace is freely distributed, and yet have none of it
   yourself! Where there is a general famine, as there lately was in the
   city of Paris, each man bears the stress with some patience, the more
   so because others are in a same plight. But oh, to starve in this city,
   when you see others feasting on plenty! Oh, this is sad, sad work! And
   some of you are being lost, while others are being saved--the very
   Sabbaths when others find Jesus, you go away without a thought of Him!
   The sermon which pierces others' hearts glides past you! The
   exhortation which points others to Calvary, you hear, but never heed!
   You are still a stranger to Him, though He has come so very rear you!
   And has it been so long that He has been with you, and yet, and yet,
   have you not known Him? Oh, this is grievous!

   "So long," the Savior says, have I been with you so long--so long? I
   must linger just one minute on that word. To be an unbeliever a day or
   even an hour after you have heard the Gospel is a very long time. A
   day! What does it mean? "Only a day," you will sometimes say. At
   another time you say, "a whole day," with a prolonged emphasis. You
   know time must often be measured by the condition in which a man is
   placed. To be beneath a lion's claw, or with one's arm in a lion's
   mouth five minutes is a great deal too long! It is a dreadful condition
   to have life in jeopardy and to be so long in fear. I have heard of one
   who fell down a deep crevice upon a glacier--between the deep blue ice.
   If you look down and throw a stone, it is long before you hear the
   sound, showing that the stone has reached the bottom. A traveler once
   slid down one by accident, and there he lay, wedged in by the ice. I
   think it was fully an hour before the ropes were brought. Why, that
   must have seemed a dreadful while to wait! An hour, you know, in good
   society, cheerfully spent, seems short, but an hour between the jaws of
   death, how dreadful! Now, an unbeliever is in as great a danger as
   that, and even in greater danger! He is under God's anger every minute
   that he is an unbeliever! It is a long time to be in jeopardy of your
   soul. A long time to be under the sentence of death. A very long time
   to be without hope. Ah, but did I speak of hours? Did I speak of
   months? Years, rather must I come to, for it has been many years with
   some of you! You remember your mother's pleadings, the Sunday school
   teacher's entreaties and now the gray hairs begin to appear here and
   there upon you, and you are still unsaved! "Have I been with you so
   long?" Perhaps you don't think it long, but it is long to God! You know
   if you have a child that has been very, very disobedient, and you say
   to him, "Now do as I tell you," he waits in stubborn silence. Some
   minutes afterwards you say, "My child, I must be obeyed. Do it." Still
   he looks angry and sullen, and bites his lips. It is a long time for
   you to wait--you feel you must soon chastise him. Oh, what a long time
   it has been for God to be waiting! There are some men whom you cannot
   provoke for a minute without rousing their temper and exciting their
   resentment. Who among us could stand such provocation, say, for an
   hour? I am afraid the best tempered man here, if incessantly provoked
   from morning to night for a week, would find that it needed much more
   Grace than he had in stock to keep him from anger. But for 40 years to
   provoke the Lord to anger? Marvel not that He was grieved, yes, and
   aggrieved with that generation. "Have I been so long time with you?"
   Has Christ been so long in your midst? Have His words sounded in your
   ears? Have you seen His deeds of mercy in blessing others? And yet all
   this while, with you so long and you do not know Him? You have not
   desired to trust Him, but you have bid Him go His way to wait your
   convenience--you intend to send for Him. Take care lest that convenient
   season comes not until the harvest is past and the summer is ended, and
   the day of Grace is over with you! Oh, may the question ring an alarm
   in your conscience! I commend it to your earnest attention, all of you
   who are unsaved!

   And now I propose to address a few thoughts to the people of God.
   Beloved Friends, by the teaching of God's Spirit, we do know the
   Savior! Of a truth we know the Son of Man to be One with the Father. We
   have been taught to discern in the face of Jesus of Nazareth the
   express image of God. We love Him. We reverence Him, we adore Him as
   our God, the Redeemer of our souls. We have much joy and much peace in
   believing and worshipping. Now, with all this knowledge, it is very
   possible--no, I think it is quite certain--that--

   II. ALL OF US HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE TO LEARN.

   Here and there, at many a turn, our vision is so clouded, our faith so
   weak, our memory so treacherous, Jesus might say to each of us, as He
   said to Philip, "Have I been with you so long, and yet have you not
   known Me?" We are slow to acquaint ourselves with our Lord and Master,
   though He is with us. This is all the more strange, because, if a man
   liveswith you, you pretty soon think you know him. You who have long
   held communion and kept company, as it were, with Jesus, ought to have
   known Him better than you do. Some men you cannot know because they are
   so changeable. You think you know them today, yet they are very
   different tomorrow. But "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
   forever." I remember some 12 or 15 years ago I was asked--very
   earnestly asked by a painter to sit for my portrait. I did sit some 10
   or 12 times, and at the end of each sitting, when I looked at what he
   had done, I thought the picture less like me than it had been before!
   He seemed to be much of the same opinion, though he was an eminent and
   skilled artist. At last he dashed his brush across the canvas and gave
   up his task in despair. When I asked him why, he said, "I never see
   your face twice alike--it is quite impossible for me to paint you." No
   such complaint can be made of our Lord's Character! Or, at least,
   though a thousand fresh beauties rise to our view as we gaze on His
   lovely face, and though the majesty and the meekness that blend in Him
   surpass all power of delineation, yet He is evermore Jesus--the same,
   ever lovely, ever kind and true, ever gracious--therefore, by resorting
   to Him and communing with Him, we ought more and more to know Him! Some
   people, it is true, you cannot know--they are so retiring and reserved.
   However long you live with them, you cannot make their acquaintance.
   They practice so much restraint curbing their feelings, hiding their
   thoughts, and sparing their words that you see not themselves. They
   show you not what they are, but what they would appear. Whether it is
   because they are proud, or because they are timid, from self-esteem or
   from diffidence, they veil the features of their mind, and it is only
   on some remarkable occasion, through a sudden grief or an unexpected
   joy, that they look, and act, and speak with perfect freedom and
   natural simplicity! Not so our Savior--He reveals Himself with open
   face. He wears His heart upon His sleeve. He is frank and ingenuous
   with His people. "If it were not so, I would have told you," He said to
   His disciples, as if He could appeal to them, and their conscience
   could witness that He had kept back no secrets from them--that between
   Him and them there was no reticence--that all He had they should have
   and all He left they should be privy to. How ought we, then, to know
   Christ, since He is neither changeable nor reserved? And yet, Brothers
   and Sisters, to how limited an extent do we really know Him!

   In various particulars our ignorance, or rather our lack of perception,
   is palpable. Some of the true servants of our Lord--perhaps there are
   such here present--do not know the very alphabet of His teaching! They
   discern not the great Doctrines of the Gospel so as to rejoice in them.
   Does Jesus say, "As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you"? And
   again, "I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and
   bring forth fruit"? They start back frightened at the Doctrine of
   Election, and shudder at the very sound of a predestinating purpose! Or
   does He say, "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall never
   perish"? They are shocked at the Doctrine of Final Perseverance and
   bleat out their cries of distress as though they thought that nothing
   could be more unsafe than security--timorous creatures! I do not think
   this lack of wisdom is as much their fault as their misfortune. They
   were taught, when they were young, to be afraid of these
   Doctrines--they then turned a deaf ear to them--and now they have
   gotten old, they are rather perplexed than comforted by them!

   Understand me, my dear Brothers and Sisters, Jesus Christ loved you,
   and He tells you the Father Himself loved you before the foundation of
   the world! He did not begin to love you after you loved Him. Is that a
   new Truth of God to you? That is the Doctrine of Election! You have
   been denying it! You thought it was a horrible and dangerous
   presumption. Have you known Christ so long and not found that out yet?
   Now, here is another Doctrine. Jesus Christ will always love you. Whom
   once He loves, He never leaves, but loves them to the end. That is the
   Doctrine of Final Perseverance. You have been afraid of that, have you
   not? Well, but have you known Christ and not found that out? Do you
   think He can change? Do you believe that He will make you a member of
   His body and cut you off? Do you imagine that He will die for you and
   then let you perish? "If, when you were an enemy, you were reconciled
   to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, you shall
   be saved through His life." My dear Brothers and Sisters, I will not
   argue that point with you, but I do believe that if you knew Jesus
   Christ better, you would think differently, for any man who supposes
   that Christ did not love His people before the world began, or that He
   will not love them when the world has ceased to be, may well hear Jesus
   say, "Have I been so long with you, and yet have you not known Me, My
   friend Arminius? Have you not found Me out yet, so as to know that I am
   God, that I change not and, therefore, the sons of Jacob are not
   consumed?"

   But some of His saints do not know their Lord in the tenderness of His
   heart, and the richness of His forgiving mercy! Perhaps there is a
   Believer here who has fallen into some great sin. My Brother, my
   Sister, I am grieved enough to hear it, and I trust your grief is more
   than you can express. If like David, you have gone astray and done evil
   in the sightof Heaven, then I hope, like David, you will feel broken
   bones and have David's penitence to go to God again for fresh
   forgiveness. After making a profession by faith, you have fallen into
   sin and sunk into despondency. Jesus Christ appears to you and He says,
   "Soul, have you sinned after coming to Me? Have you sinned and brought
   My name into dishonor? I am still ready to forgive you. Come and put
   your trust again in Me, and your transgression shall be blotted out."
   Doubt whispers, "Lord, I cannot see how You can forgive this." "Why,"
   He would say, "have I been so long with you, and yet you do not know
   Me? When did I ever refuse to forgive one of My servants? Did not Peter
   deny Me? Yes, with oaths and cursing? And what did I do to Peter? Did I
   say, Peter shall never be My servant again? No. I did but look at him
   and that broke his heart. And afterwards I said to him, Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me? That is all I said that looked like
   chastisement, and I forgave him, and made him My disciple." Oh, child
   of God, stained with sin, if you say, "Christ cannot wash me again,"
   then you have been a long time with Him and you have not known Him! Or,
   again, into what a morbid state our minds will sometimes sink. The
   other day I was in this plight, and perhaps you may be in the same,
   full of wandering thoughts. I could not read a Chapter with any sort of
   understanding. After going through two or three verses, I felt that I
   might as well have been reading Virgil. I tried to pray. Oh, such
   prayers!--a few words and then it was as if I was not praying at all!
   So I thought within myself, "Can the Lord accept me, a poor, weak,
   worthless soul as I am? I cannot control my thoughts." Then came
   headache and pain, till I was worse, still, and I began to question how
   I could be accepted of God in my devotion when it was all dull and
   languid, without fire or fervor. But afterwards I thought to myself
   thus--If my dear child had been told to do a thing, and he was sick and
   ill, and did his best, I know I would not blame him--I would say, "Poor
   soul, I see he would do it better if he could." And can I imagine that
   my Lord, when He has known me so long, will judge me by the distraction
   of my mind or the weakness of my body? Ah, but sometimes I have feared
   He would! If any of you are harboring such a thought, you may see Him
   standing by you and hear Him addressing you in these tender accents,
   "Have I been with you so long, and yet have you not known Me? Do not
   you know Me well enough to understand that I can interpret your
   feeblest prayer? Do you think Me a harsh tyrant, or a hard taskmaster?
   Why, I love you! I pity you from my very soul! Do not misjudge Me--I do
   not misjudge you, I take the will for the deed. I read your groans and
   I bottle up your tears."

   The question may sometimes be driven home to us in another kind of
   experience, When called to suffer in mind, in body, or in estate, it is
   easy for those who would comfort us to quote that sweet assuring
   passage of Scripture, "We know that all things work together for good
   to them that love God." But it is not half as easy for those who smart
   under adversity to encourage themselves in the Lord. When racked with
   many pains from which you seek in vain for relief, or when you are very
   poor and straitened in your circumstances--when your cupboard is bare
   and you have no work to do-- when the children are crying for bread and
   you have no wages to receive, then have you not felt, amidst your
   weighty griefs, how black thoughts will haunt your mind, dark surmises
   will hover about your imagination and, oh, it might happen in some
   unguarded moment, that rebellious murmurings would come upon your sins?
   "Can this be right? Can God be kind? Has He forgotten to be gracious?
   Where now is that all-bountiful Providence we were known to look to? Is
   this in any way consistent with love?" But hush, my Soul, nor dare
   repine! It is the voice of Jesus which says to you, "Have I been with
   you so long, and yet you have not known Me? The last time I afflicted
   you, did not it turn out for your good? You have had sore trials by the
   way--were they not means of great blessing to you? Don't you know Me
   yet? Cannot you trust Me?" Here is the bitter medicine--you have taken
   some before, and your health has been restored. You took a draught the
   other day when the fever was upon you, and it drove it away. Don't you
   know enough of the skill of your physician to put yourself in his hands
   and take whatever he prescribes, cheerfully and without objections?
   Surely, Brothers and Sisters, we would not wince so much at our
   afflictions if we did but know the Master better! From the hand of the
   Lord we would accept them, and we would bow to the will of the Lord in
   bearing them.

   The same may be said to us when we are called to some new labor.
   Preacher, teacher, visitor--may any of them find their labor of love
   and irksome toil, when beset with difficulties and consumed with
   sorrows? The young minister encountering tastes and tempers that vex
   his soul. The superintendent of a class striving to instruct children
   who will not listen, much less learn. The visitor who is repulsed by
   those she courts and upbraided by those she strives to befriend--all of
   these are apt to complain, "Lord, why have You called me to this
   particular work? In other departments I might have succeeded--this I
   cannot do. I have neither the ability nor the strength." Then, again,
   might Jesus lay His dear pierced hand on your shoulder and say, "Have I
   been with you so long, and yet have you not known Me? Did I ever send
   you to a warfare at your own charges? Did I ever give you work to
   perform and leave you unsupported? Have I not always provedthat, as
   your day, so shall your strength be"? Go in this, your might, for I
   will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not doubt Me, for if you do,
   you have not known Me."

   The scruple that sometimes comes over God's children about praying for
   little things is another instance of their not knowing Christ. "Oh,"
   says one, "if my child were dying, I could pray about that, but when he
   is only fretful and hard to manage, though it does worry me a good
   deal, and sorely grieves my spirit, yet I cannot go and lay such a
   trivial matter before my great Lord!" Then you don't know Him. "Have I
   been so long with you, and have you not known Me, Philip?" Has not the
   Lord said that He counts the hairs of our head, and that not a sparrow
   falls to the ground without His decree? Your Savior is as great in His
   attention to tiny needs as in His administration of grand affairs! Take
   the thorn in your finger to Christ! Take the stone in your shoe to
   Christ! I mean, Pilgrim, if you get a little care that may fester and
   breed great pain, take that to Christ! I mean, Pilgrim, if you have a
   little trial on your way to Heaven, take that to Christ, or else you
   shall do amiss! You know Him not if you cannot trust Him with anything
   and everything, whatever it may be that relates to your welfare!

   Now I shall give you two more instances which show how we may be with
   Christ and yet may not have known Him as we should. One shall be this.
   Every now and then I hear Christians saying--(I am glad to hear it)--"I
   offered prayer on such-and-such an account, and God has graciously
   heard me." I am pleased to hear them make the confession of answered
   prayerfor it tends to cheer and encourage others. But when they go on
   to exclaim, "Is it not surprising? Does not it seem almost incredible?
   Is it not marvelous?" I think they betray a weakness! Have I not heard
   many speak of Mr. Muller's orphan houses at Bristol, and the honor put
   on him as extraordinary? It seems as though they thought it
   unbelievable that God would hear that dear man's prayers! "More than
   two thousand children supported by prayer and faith," they said--"How
   amazing!" as if our Lord, in this, had exceeded His own promise! Well,
   but has Christ been so long with us that we think these things strange?
   Were I to hear it reported that such a man, after having been married
   20 years, had taken a present home to his wife, which he had handed to
   her very kindly and very generously, but which she had accepted with a
   look of surprise and an exclamation of, "Who would have thought it?" I
   would say, "Ah, then, they have lived a rather sorry life together, or
   else, though she might have been delighted, she certainly would not
   have been astounded at her husband's generosity to her! Or, again, if I
   heard that a certain individual had paid his debts, and if it was
   talked of down Cheapside and all over London, I should naturally infer
   that it was a great wonder he did so, that on his part it was a thing
   uncommon and on the part of his creditors a thing unexpected! So, too,
   when I hear it spoken of as passing strange, a prodigy, that God should
   be gracious to His people, I blush for those who are amazed at what
   they might have expected! Am I to understand it to be really surprising
   that the Faithful Promiser keeps His promise? That our heavenly Father
   bestows good things on His children? That He who encouraged us to ask
   and engaged Himself to give, should answer our petitions? I dare not
   think thus! It seems to me that your sudden surprises tell of evil
   surmises! I would rather say, with that good old Christian lady who,
   when she was told of God's hearing prayer, and asked if it was not
   surprising, replied, "No, it is just like Him! It is His way. He is
   always doing it!" Ah, truly, when we express surprise at His answering
   prayer and delivering His servants according to His promise, He might
   well say, "What? Have I been with you so long, and have you not known
   Me?"

   With one more instance I conclude. Full many a time I have heard the
   Master's voice in the inner chambers of my heart, expostulating with me
   thus--Have I been with you so long, and have you not known Me? And then
   I have said, Alas, Lord, I have not known You as I should and I feel
   that I cannot know You as I would. Come, Beloved, let us talk it over
   together. Sometimes, in deep quietude of spirit, our heart has been
   giving itself to devotion--it may have been a time of suffering. The
   world was all shut out, and sweetly did our soul begin to perceive the
   love and the loveliness of Christ, till the vision of the Savior grew
   clearer and brighter and more brilliant. We saw His Godhead, admired
   His condescension that He should stoop to redeem. We saw His Manhood,
   grateful that He would come so near to us as to be bone of our bone,
   and flesh of our flesh. We saw Him at Gethsemane--seemed to count the
   bloody drops as they fell in a sweat from His brow. We saw Him on the
   Cross, marked His hands and feet. Our soul could follow Him up to
   Heaven, there view Him on the right hand of the Throne of God,
   pleading. We drew near unto Him. He wrapped us in His crimson vest and
   told us all His name.

   Then we felt we knew more in that hour than we had ever known before,
   so that all we had known seemed nothing! We said to our soul, "Have we
   been so long time with Him, and yet have we not known Him till this
   hour, as we know Him now?" Now, between here and Heaven, unless we go
   Home very shortly, there will come a good many of these openings of the
   golden gates--times in which the King will bring us to His banqueting
   house. Doubtless, each time will He reveal Himself more intimately when
   we look more fully at Him and discover more of His blessed features and
   His sacred mind--each time we shall rise up from the sacred festival
   and say, "Long time as I have been with Him, I have not known Him until
   now." On every fresh occasion we shall be ready to exclaim, like the
   Queen of Sheba when she saw the glory of Solomon, "The half has not
   been told me." And when you get face to face with Him, your admiration
   will become so intense that though you will have a grateful remembrance
   of all you did know of Him on earth, you will say, "I was a long time
   with Him--twenty, 30, forty years, but I did not then know Him as I
   know Him now! I had a little fellowship with Him in the valley of tears
   below, but oh, I did but paint a bleary-eyed picture of the lovely
   King. Mine was but a poor dreamy, smoky imagination of this bright Sun,
   this Sun of Righteousness in His Glory, my King, the Chief among ten
   thousand, the altogether lovely." I pray, Brothers and Sisters, that,
   gathering round His Table, you may have just such a season as shall
   make you ashamed of what you have known before in comparison with what
   you see now of His beauty! And then may you go on further and further
   learning of Christ, making discoveries of His Glory till you shall be
   with Him where He is, to behold that Glory, and to be participators in
   it!

   God bless you at this feast of His love. May He be present with us to
   make glad our hearts! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 19:11-16.

   11-13. And I saw Heaven opened, and beholda white horse; andHe who sat
   upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He does
   judge and make war His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head
   were many crowns; and He had a name written, that no man knew, but He,
   Himself And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name
   is called The Word of God.That same Logos of whom John wrote in the
   Gospel now stands before him and he beholds Him in His Glory. What a
   delight it must have been to the seer of Patmos to see his Lord and
   Master once again in different array from that in which he had beheld
   Him when, in humiliation, He tabernacled here among the sons of men!
   His name is still the same--The Logos--The Word of God.

   14-16. And the armies which were in Heaven followed Him upon white
   horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of His mouth
   goes a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations: and He
   shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treads the winepress of the
   fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His vesture and on
   His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. And this is
   the Man of Nazareth. This is the crucified, despised, and rejected One.
   Servus servorum once.--Servant of servants but now King of kings and
   Lord of lords! And what will the end be of the battle that He wages?
   Will any of His adversaries escape? Will they hold their own? No, they
   shall utterly be destroyed before Him! All the powers of evil, of false
   doctrine--everything contrary to His mind-- shall be destroyed. And
   this is set forth in symbolic imagery by the dreadful battle feast
   which usually succeeds a battle, when the vultures smell the carrion
   from afar and come to rend the spoil. It shall not be thus with the
   bodies of men, but thus with evil--thus with the powers of darkness.

The King Passing Over Kidron

   (No. 3431)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   18 1869.

   "The king, himself, also passed over the Brook Kidron." 2 Samuel 15:23.

   THE Brook Kidron was an insignificant, but usually a most foul and
   filthy ditch outside the walls of Jerusalem. If it were not, as some
   have called it, the open town sewer, yet there are reasons for
   believing that at least the filth of the Temple ran into it. The
   scourings of the sacrificial places went by an under-channel into this
   brook and we have one or two instances in Holy Writ where, when houses
   were purged and cleansed, the filth was thrown into the Brook Kidron.
   The passing, therefore, over that foul and black brook becomes the
   symbol of a time of deep sorrow and acute distress. The king, himself,
   then, passed over the Brook Kidron. The royal road lies over the place
   of sorrow. The way, even for kings, is by the brook of grief and shame.
   Let us think over that thought for a while.

   I. THIS WAS TRUE OF KING DAVID.

   David was one of the best of kings--certainly in the long list of his
   successors we meet with none who did such service to his country as did
   David, the once shepherd boy. It was through him, in his youth, that
   the country was saved from being enslaved by Philistia, and oftentimes
   in later years that stout heart and brave arm led in the van against
   the enemies of the Israel of God. He was the patriot king. If his
   country became a happy one, it was through his valor that it became so.
   And yet, good as he was, his subjects disowned and turned against him!
   And, in fear of them, "the king, himself, also passed over the Brook
   Kidron." It is an ungrateful world we live in. Those who serve it best
   will find that at times it gives no rewards, or only gives them
   grudgingly--and afterwards forgets the good the man has done, because
   for some moment the tide of popular feeling may set against him.
   "Cursed is he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm." If you live
   to your fellow men, even with the largest desires within you, yet if
   you forget to live also to your God, your cup will be full of wormwood,
   and your teeth will be broken with the gravel of disappointment.

   David was also one of the most tender of fathers. He was never exacting
   with his children. I do not say he was one of the best of fathers, for
   correction was much neglected in his house. But he was a tender father
   and he had denied to Absalom nothing. And yet this renegade, this
   ungrateful, this unnatural son, was the very one from whom the sting
   must come. Marvel not if they who owe their lives to you should seek
   your life! Marvel not if those who once nestled in your bosoms should
   wound you to the quick with their unkindness. You must not build upon
   the love of even the dearest you know. Your God is faithful and the
   Well-Beloved never changes, but all others can, and may, and sometimes
   do! 'Twas a dark Brook Kidron which David passed over when his favorite
   son, Absalom, was in hot pursuit of him--the great king, the good
   monarch, the tender father--was not exempt from this!

   Despite the one great stain upon his character in the matter of
   Bathsheba, David was one of the best and most devout of men. I am sure
   the older one grows, the more one loves his Psalms, and what a history
   of the man you have there! It is a mercy for us that he was not a
   better man than he was, or else he could not have written Psalms
   suitable to such poor creatures as we are. I think I saw the other day
   in a window, concerning a certain statesman whom I love to honor, that
   he would be a better statesman if he were a worse man. I think not so,
   but still David, if he had been a better man, would have been a worse
   Psalmist, for even the faults of his character, inasmuch as they bring
   him down to our poor level, qualify him to write according to the
   feelings of our hearts and the emotions of our spirits. But he was a
   grand man, that David. He had the soldier's fault and he fell into the
   soldier's sin, but he also had the soldier's generous spirit and the
   soldier's self-sacrificing nobility of heart. He was through and
   through, a man. In him there was no guile. He hated deception, and he
   loved his God with all his heart! And yet, for all that, he must pass
   over the Brook Kidron. Hated by his subjects, despised by his darling
   child, with all the robes of royalty put aside, barefooted and with
   sackcloth on his head, Jerusalem's best and greatest king makes his way
   into the wilderness!

   I gather from this that there is no extent of sorrow which is not
   possible to an heir of Heaven, and more yet, that there is no degree of
   shame, of calumny and of reproach, which may not gather around the best
   of men. The king, himself, also passed over Kidron and you know what
   happened when he passed over. The faithful soldiers wept as they saw
   that royal head dishonored, and those bright eyes that had flashed
   death upon his foes in the day of battle, now red with weeping. But
   what did Shimei do? He cursed him and threw dust upon him, and said,
   "Go up, you bloody man!" And what did Ahithophel do? He forsook
   him--seceded to the winning side and plotted the death of his former
   friend, even King David, himself, with whom he had so often eaten bread
   and walked to the House of God in company! And what said they all over
   the nation concerning David, but that God had forsaken him and,
   therefore, theymight forsake and attack him, for the David of former
   days was not the same David now. His God had left him and the crown was
   given to his son. Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, we know not what we may
   come to! We do not know what depths of grief we may yet have to fathom,
   nor into what deep mire we may yet sink. There is no saying. The best
   of men may have the worst of characters! The brightest stars may be
   swallowed up in a night! The moon, in her brightness, may be hidden by
   the clouds. And the sun, itself, beneath the wings of tempest, may be
   concealed. Shall we, when we see our Christian Brothers and Sisters
   assailed, forsake them? Shall we join in the common clamor against
   them? We shall if we are not good men and true, but if we are such as
   God would have us be, we shall stand up for God's David as Ittai and
   his bodyguard did in the day of battle. We shall say, "These are the
   servants of the Most High God! Persecute them as you may. Cast the dust
   of slander upon them. Call them fanatics, enthusiasts, disturbers of
   the peace, and turners of the world upside down--we cast in our lot
   with them--for better or for worse, we take their Master and
   themselves, and across their Kidron will we go with them, believing
   that the day shall come when it shall be thought worth men's while to
   come back with them after another sort."

   For, Brothers and Sisters, David came again up to Jerusalem. The Lord
   smote his enemies in their hinder parts, and put them to the rout. He
   came back, again, with sound of song and rejoicing. And so shall the
   righteous! So shall the best of men, in the day when God lights their
   candle and puts every tongue that rises against them in judgment to
   eternal condemnation! Stand you to the right, stand to the true! Stand
   faithful! Be willing to suffer. Be willing to be rebuked. Be willing to
   be slandered. King David went this way before you, and the day shall
   come when you, like he, shall come up from the slander and the scorn,
   the better for it all, rejoicing in God, who is the God of your
   salvation!

   Thus much on David. I think there is much of interesting Truths of God
   to be gathered from David's history in passing over Kidron, if we had
   time to bring it out. But I rather suggest a vein of thought than
   attempt to enlarge upon it. But now, secondly--

   II. A GREATER KING THAN DAVID PASSED OVER THE BROOK KIDRON and if, as
   David passed, all thepeople wept, let the people weep tonight as they
   remember how Zion's greater King passed over that black brook!

   There never was such a King as He--so glorious and fair to look upon.
   His eyes were the suns of Heaven, and His Presence was the Glory
   thereof. But He came down among His creatures, who were fallen, seeking
   nothing but their good. He raised their dead. He healed their sick.
   When they were hungry, He fed them, and when they were fainting, He
   refreshed them. His words were those of love and His teachings full of
   wisdom and of Grace. But now they seek His blood! Yes, they seek His
   blood and in the night they are pursuing Him. They will come upon Him.
   They will haul Him off to the judgment seat--they will put Him to
   death. Oh, cruel world, not to know its best Benefactor! One of our
   poets has called Christ, "the Great Philanthropist," and so He was,
   only the word falls far short of what He really was, for He loved His
   people with all His heart! He came unto His own, and His own received
   Him not. Yes, His own, the Jews, were the most fierce in His
   destruction!

   As the King passed over Kidron on that gloomy night, He had with Him a
   band of friends, but what was their friendship worth? They were true in
   heart, but they were weak and feeble. And when the conflict came, they
   all forsook Him and fled! Peter, where are you? I know you, I hear you
   say, "I know not the Man," as with oaths and cursing you do deny Him!
   And John, where are you? Was not that John, the young man upon whom
   they laid hands, and he fled and left his garments behind him? Where
   are any of them? "Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled." In that
   bitter hour when

   He passed over Kidron, to make His cup as bitter as it could be, the
   kiss that betrayed Him came from the lips of Judas, the treasurer of
   His little band. "Friend!" he said, and betrayed Him with a friendly
   word upon his traitorous tongue!

   To enter into the griefs of our Lord in Gethsemane is not our business,
   tonight, though we feel as if we must linger among those beds of bitter
   herbs, and stand and look into Kidron's gloomy stream. But you remember
   how He suffered even unto death for us, and what were the agonies by
   which He purchased our redemption! There is this concerning our Lord,
   which is not matched by David--He did actually die. He was absolutely
   slain. The foes who pursued Him overtook Him--they pierced His hands
   and His feet, they lifted Him up a spectacle of scorn--and there He
   died. But His Cross was His triumph! Calvary was a battlefield on which
   He won the victory and, like David, He came back again into Jerusalem,
   rising from the grave, no more to suffer or to die! And He returned
   again to Heaven, from where He came, with sound of clarion and with
   noise of them that make music and melody for joy of heart--"Lift up
   your heads, O you gates! And be you lift up, you everlasting doors,
   that the King of Glory may come in!"

   See then, dear Brothers and Sisters, in the Person of our Lord, that
   this is a prophecy and an assurance that the cause of right and of
   truth--that those who espouse that cause and are pure and perfect,
   themselves, may, nevertheless, be brought very low--even to the dust!
   They may be slandered, despised and rejected and yes, for all that,
   their triumph is not in jeopardy and neither their cause nor themselves
   imperiled! Oh, it makes one strong to feel this! There cannot be
   anything happen to us so severe as has already happened to our King!
   There cannot be any slander more fierce than the slander poured on Him.
   They have called the Master of the house, Beelzebub! What can they now
   call the men of His household? They must find some lighter name for us!
   Be encouraged, then, you feeble bands of trembling Christians,
   encouraged in all your sufferings and griefs for Christ's sake, for as
   He yet rose from the dead and led captivity captive, even so shall the
   feeblest of His followers! And so I shall close by just speaking--

   III. A WORD OR TWO TO OURSELVES CONCERNING OUR PASSING THE BROOK
   KIDRON.

   Ah, we do not like going over Kidron. When it comes to the pinch, how
   we struggle against suffering, and especially against dishonor and
   slander! How many there were who would have gone on pilgrimage, but
   that Mr. Shame proved too much for them--they could not bear to go over
   the black Brook Kidron, could not endure to be made nothing of for the
   sake of the Lord of Glory--they even turned back!

   Now I have these two words to say. First, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   with regard to the great cause of God throughout the world, we must
   expect, in following the Truth of God, to meet with many attacks, many
   hardships and many defeats. I do not think that the Lord's cause was
   ever meant to be consecutively triumphant, without intervals of defeat.
   The sea advances to the flood tide, wave by wave--first one wave
   advances, and then it recedes. Then another comes up and recedes again,
   and sometimes when the tide is coming to the very highest, there will
   be one of those waves which seems to go back and leave a wider space
   bare of seawater than before. And so it is with the cause of
   Christianity. A great wave rolled up at Pentecost, but it seemed to
   pause while under Herod's persecution. Then came other waves, until the
   world beheld, in some degree, the Light of Christ in all its corners.
   But again, there was a pausing for a while in those ages, which we call
   the Dark Ages. Then came a mighty wave again, which we couple with the
   name of Luther and of Calvin. Again there seemed to be a drawback, and
   then again, in the days of Whitfield, Wesley, Jonathan Edwards and
   others, there was another revival! And so it will be, I suppose, right
   on to the end of the Chapter--progress, and then a staying of the
   work--great success, then temporary defeat. Now are any of you living
   in districts where, notwithstanding much earnest work, the name of
   Christ does not seem to win the day? Do not be downcast! Do not be
   dispirited! Rather go to the Throne of Grace more earnestly and ask for
   Grace to gird yourselves afresh for the battle. The King passed over
   Kidron, and so shall His cause in your village, in your street, and the
   whole cause of God to which you are attached! But the King came back
   again, and so will He come back to you if you keep up heart and
   courage, and be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of
   the Lord!

   I know how it is in some of your hearts. You seemed to be growing in
   Grace so fast. You thought, "I shall soon reach a high standard of
   Grace!" But now you are discovering your corruption. You are perplexed
   and cast down because you do not grow as you once did. You are not so
   happy as you once were. Well, it may be you are passing over your
   Kidron, but do not be afraid! The King who has come to dwell in your
   hearts, though He is driven for a little into the wilderness and is
   hidden in the dark corners of your spirit, will come up again and take
   the throne, and reign, and drive out His enemy! Hold on, hold on to
   Christ's Cross and crown, for the victory will attend them still! Only
   be patient, for God is in no hurry. Wait and let Him have His time, and
   the good work around you, and the work within you will prove to be
   successful after all! Just at this juncture we, who fight for Christ's
   crown and seek to set His Truth free from the unholy alliance which she
   has so basely formed, may find, perhaps, that for a while
   disappointment awaits our banners. But if it does, we shall not for a
   moment quail in our courage nor stay in pressing the good cause on to
   the ultimate and the universal victory! Perhaps 'tis well that we do
   wait a while, for we might achieve but one purpose now--but a little
   pausing will set us on greater designs and on nobler aims. One Church
   set free in Ireland, if it is not done quickly, another shall be set
   free and England's church be made to know that she has no right to ride
   rough-shod over this nation--and liberty and religious equality will be
   proclaimed here as well as there--and all the sooner because of the
   delay! Let the King's cause go over Kidron for a while, and the great
   ones of the earth set themselves in array against Christ and His
   crown-- but the victory will come, and we can afford to wait and tarry
   till the predestined hour--for perhaps by waiting the vessel shall come
   back laden the more richly with treasure, to the water's edge pressed
   down with costly freight. But back she will come, come certainly and
   surely, to her Master's honor, and to the comfort of the Church of God
   in this our realm! Never let us despair for the Truth. Do the just
   thing and never be afraid! Let the earth be removed and the mountains
   be cast into the midst of the sea--if you do the right and stand up for
   Christ, you need never fear! What if nations crack like potter's
   vessels and are driven like chaff before the wind by revolution after
   revolution? The saints of God rejoice that the battle is the Lord's and
   He will deliver every foe into our hands before long! And if He tarries
   for awhile, we will wait until He comes, for He will surely bring the
   victory with Him!

   Lastly, just this gentle word to any of you who may at this time be
   greatly suffering. "The King, Himself, also passed over the Brook
   Kidron." Dear Brothers and Sisters, we, too, must all pass over Kidron,
   but the Prince's footsteps, the Prince's footsteps, are all along the
   road--

   "He leads us through no darker rooms, Than He went through before." Let
   us have courage, then, and go through, too. You have had a sad
   bereavement. Yes, I wonder not that your tears fell on that coffin
   lid--'twas a precious life to lose, but, "Jesus wept," and that
   handkerchief of yours is perfumed with His sympathy. You had a heavy
   loss and you dread poverty. Well, it is an evil to be much dreaded, but
   the foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, but the Son of
   Man had nowhere to lay His head. Your poverty is gilded with His
   companionship! He was poorer than you! Oh, but you have lately been
   slandered. 'Tis the lot of all the righteous--birds always peck the
   ripest and the richest fruit the most. But they slandered your
   Lord--they said He was a drunk and a wine-bibber. They are only
   crowning you with the crown of thorns which once was put on His
   head--and the thorns are not so sharp for you as for Him--they were
   blunted by being put on His head. Ah, but you tell me that with all
   this a dear friend that you loved has turned against you. Remember
   Judas and do not marvel any more. "Ah," you say, "but even the Church
   of God thinks evil of me, though I have stood steadfast in the Truth."
   Remember your Lord was an alien to His mother's children, and the
   Church of His day was His direct enemy. Courage, dear Brothers and
   Sisters and fellow pilgrims to the skies! We must drink this cup--our
   heavenly Father has decreed it, but then He has mixed it, too, and He
   promises us, if we drink it, that we shall, by-and-by, drink of another
   cup of the new wine in the Kingdom of Glory! Submit--no,
   more--acquiesce! No, more, rejoice that you are counted worthy to
   suffer with your Lord! Cleave to your King when the many turn aside!
   Witness that He has the Living Word, and no one upon the earth beside,
   and in the day when the trumpet rings out the victory and the King
   comes back to His own, you shall come back with Him to the ivory
   palaces and to the abodes of the blessed, where you shall be crowned
   and shall dwell forever!

   Dear Hearers, are you for Christ or for His enemies? Will you go with a
   despised Christ tonight? Will you take sides with Christ under the
   cloud? Will you go with Him barefoot through the mire, or do you like a
   silver-slipper religion? I pray you trust my Lord and Master! Take up
   His Cross. It will be the best thing you ever did, for it will bring
   you a glory in which the shame shall be forgotten!

   The Lord bless each one of you, and may these few words comfort those
   who are tremblings for Christ's sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 SAMUEL 15:13-23; ISAIAH 61; MARK
   14:22-41.

   This was one of the greatest trials of David's life.

   Verses 13, 14. And there came a messenger to David, saying, the hearts
   ofthe men ofIsraelare after Absalom. And David said unto all his
   servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for
   we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart lest he
   overtake us suddenly, and brings evil upon us, and smites the city with
   the edge of the sword.There is much to admire in David's conduct when
   he fled from Absalom, but yet his courage would seem to have well near
   forsaken him. In his brighter days before his great sin had weakened
   him, he would have been master of the situation, but now he trembles in
   the presence of the great calamity.

   15. And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, your servants
   are ready to do whatever my lord, the king, shall appoint.They were
   attached to him--ready to take his counsel at once. Can we say the same
   to King Jesus? Will every Christian here now say to his Master,
   "Behold, Your servants are ready to do whatever my Lord, the King,
   shall appoint"? There are many that pick and choose of Christ's
   commands. They do not obey all His will. There are known duties which
   are neglected--plain precepts which are willfully forgotten. I would to
   God we could all say from our heart to King Jesus, "Behold, Your
   servants are ready to do whatever my Lord, the King, shall appoint."

   16-18. And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
   the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. And
   the king went forth, and all the people after him and tarried in a
   place that was far off And all his servants passed on beside him. And
   all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
   hundred men, who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
   These were his old guard, soldiers who he kept always around his
   person, deeply attached to him, upon whose loyalty he could rely. But
   what a come-down from the King of Israel to have an army of only 600
   men--to be fleeing before his own rebellious people, led on by his more
   rebellious son!

   19-23. Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why do you, also, go
   with us? Return to your place and abide with the king: for you are a
   stranger, and also an exile. Whereas you came but yesterday, should I
   this day make you go up and down with us? Seeing I go where I may, you
   return and take back your brethren: mercy and truth be with you. And
   Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord,
   the king, lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether
   in death, or life, even there also will your servant be. And David said
   to Ittai, Go and pass over And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all
   his men, and all the little ones that were with him and all the country
   wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed over The king,
   himself also passed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people passed
   over, toward the way of the wilderness.A fit type of that future
   passage of the Kidron by the great Son of David when, on that dark and
   doleful night, when all the powers of darkness met the Prince--the
   King, Himself--passed over that black and bitter brook into the Garden
   of Gethsemane. There were faithful ones that went with David--there
   were some faithful ones with Christ. Happy are they who shall be found
   to be with their Lord and Master in the day of His sorrow, for they
   shall be with Him in the day of His joy!

   ISAIAH61.

   Verses 1, 2. The Spirit ofthe Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has
   anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He has sent Me to
   bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim the acceptable year ofthe LORD,
   and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn. How
   condescending and how kind are the objectives of our Savior's
   mission--to put an end to sorrow! He searches for the mourners--they
   are the special objects of His care--and all that He does has this for
   one of its grand objectives--to comfort all that mourn! Surely if there
   is any troubled heart here, it may claim an interest in such a Divine
   work as this! Jesus has come to comfort all that mourn. Shall He not
   comfort you?

   3. To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion. To make an appointment--an
   ordinance--a decree concerning them. And it will be to this effect--

   3. To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
   garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness: that they might be
   called trees of righteousness, the planting ofthe LORD, that He might
   be glorified. So it seems that God finds glory in the helping of His
   sad, sick, sorrowful creatures! He gets a glory out of making them. He
   gets higher glory out of making them new! Creation yields the moonlight
   glory--the new creation is a glory as of the sun shining in its
   strength! O you mourners, may God grant you Grace now to give glory to
   God by cheerfully accepting those wondrous blessings of Grace which
   Christ has come to bestow!

   4. And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former
   desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of
   many generations.When mourning souls find comfort, and captive souls
   get liberty, they are full of life and full of energy--and they begin
   to restore what had become wasted and desolate. I guarantee you that
   there is nothing for a Church by way of medicine at all equal to
   pouring new blood into her by new-saved souls! They come among us with
   their new songs, like the sweet birds in summer, and seem to wake the
   morning with their gladsome music. They come among us like the dewdrops
   from the womb of the morning, sparkling in beauty, bearing the dew of
   their youth. May God send to many old churches that have got to be like
   old wastes, and some communities that have come to be like
   desolations--may He send to them these builders--these earnest, loving
   hearts to build them up!

   5. 6. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
   ofthe alien shall be your plowmen and your vine dressers. But you shall
   be named the priests ofthe LORD. God's true Israel, His chosen, His
   elect--they may look upon all other men as their plowmen and their vine
   dressers. Kings and queens rule the world for you. For you the
   merchant, with his weights, divides the sea. For you, the plowman plows
   the soil. As for you, though you have a hand in these things, they are
   not your main employment. Your occupation is a higher one than
   theirs--the service of your God! You shall be named the priests of the
   Lord.

   6. Men shall call you ministers of our God: you shall eat the riches
   ofthe Gentiles, andin their glory shall you boast yourselves. For all
   things are of God, and all things are yours through Jesus Christ. In
   that same day in which the Lord comforts mourners and binds up their
   broken hearts, He gives them to enter into a sacred priesthood in which
   they walk among the sons men as God's peculiar people--honored above
   all the rest of mankind. Oh, the distinctions which distinguishing
   Grace makes! How it lifts the poor from the dunghill and sits him among
   princes, even the princes of His people! Christ has done great things,
   indeed, for us, for though we were as beggars, behold He has made us
   kings and priests unto God--and we shall reign forever and ever!

   7. For your shame you shall have double: and for confusion they shall
   rejoice in their portion. You may be persecuted. Your name may be cast
   out as evil, but when the Lord in mercy blesses and visits you, you
   shall have a wonderful recompense--more than you could have expected.
   "For your shame you shall have double."

   7, 8. Therefore in their land they shall possess the double.
   Everlasting joy shall be unto them. For I the LORD love judgment, I
   hate robbery for burnt offering and I will direct their work in truth,
   and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with them. There are churches
   in the world that are not churches of God, and they supply their needs
   by forged demands from the people. But God hates robbery for a burnt
   offering. He accepts the willing gifts of His people and, with those
   who present them, He makes an Everlasting Covenant.

   9. And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
   offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them,
   that they are the seed which the LORD has blessed. Oh, to have such
   distinguishing marks of character about us that all who see us may see
   that the blessing of God is upon us! And this will be quite consistent
   with poverty, with sickness, for in the poverty there will be content,
   and in the sickness and depression of spirit there will yet be such
   Divine upholding that men shall be astonished that their fellow men
   shall be capable of such joy under such circumstances! They "shall
   acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord has blessed."

   10. I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. Brothers and Sisters, I wish we
   could all catch hold of the spirit of this verse that each one of us
   would now say, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord."

   10. My soul shall be joyful in my God. What a precious sentence--"My
   soul shall be joyful in my God."

   10. For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation. He has
   covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks
   himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
   On those festive occasions the Orientals are known to use all the
   wealth they have in decoration. The bridegroom decks himself with a
   crown--puts on a tiara. He is a king for once. And the bride herself
   brings out all the many jewels with which Eastern women deck
   themselves. Now all this, in a high spiritual sense, we find in Christ.
   He is not merely a covering to us, but ornament and beauty, adornment,
   exaltation, glory, honor! How beautiful a child of God looks in Christ,
   I cannot tell you, but I believe that next to His dear Son, the most
   engaging sight to the Divine Father is any one of His dear children
   whom He sees in Christ. You know we all think our children lovely--but
   God knows His children to be so when He has covered them with the robe
   of righteousness--and clothed them with the garments of salvation!

   11. For as the earth brings forth her buds and as the garden causes the
   things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord GOD will cause
   righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

   MARK 14:22-41.

   Verse 22. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke
   it, and gave it to them and said, Take, eat. This is My body. It was
   part of a meal. It was no celebration. It was no sacrifice, bloody or
   unbloody! It was simply a commemorative ceremony of which He would now
   give them a specimen even before it became commemorative. "As they did
   eat, Jesus took bread." No seeking for consecrated wafers or some
   special food, but such bread as they had been eating.
   "Blessed"--thanking God for it. "And broke it and gave it to them, and
   said, Take, eat. This is My body."

   23, 24. And He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it
   to them, and they all drank of it. And He said unto them, This is My
   blood, ofthe new testament, which is shed for many. There was no fear
   of their making the mistake, which has been made by Humanists, of
   taking these words literally, because Jesus Christ was sitting there!
   They could not imagine that as He took bread, He would say, literally,
   "This bread is My body." Why, there was His body sitting there before
   them! Had He two bodies? When He gave them the cup and said, "This is
   My blood of the new Covenant," they never dreamt of such a thing as the
   wine in the cup was really and literally His blood! His blood was in
   His veins. They saw Him living there, not bleeding! No, it is an
   extraordinary thing that men who have the life of God in them, and have
   some spiritual discernment, have, nevertheless, in some instances, been
   found driving their faith into the belief of the absurd fable of
   transubstantiation! Jesus Christ means, "This represents My body. This
   represents My blood"--the usual way of uttering such a sense both in
   the Old and New Testament, even as Christ said, "I am the door." Yet
   nobody thought that he was a door! "I am the way." Nobody thought He
   was a roadway! "I am the shepherd," and yet nobody supposed that he
   carried a crook and that He literally kept sheep! So He says, "This is
   My body, this is My blood" and they who sat there were in their
   senses--they were not superstitious. They knew what He meant.

   25, 26. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more ofthe fruit ofthe
   vine until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God. And when
   they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the Mount of Olives. I cannot
   resist repeating the remark I have often made about that singing of a
   hymn. It seems to me such a grand, brave thing for the Savior to sing a
   hymn after the last meal that he would eat with His disciples before
   His death--when He knew that He was going forth to all the torture of
   Pilate's Hall and to death at Calvary! Yet He says, "Let us sing a
   hymn." He chose a Psalm of David and, I dare say, He, Himself pitched a
   tune. "And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the Mount of
   Olives."

   27. And Jesus said unto them--As they walked along.

   27, 28. All you shall be offended because of Me this night: for it is
   written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
   But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. What sweet
   comfort was there--as much as to say, "Though you are scattered, I will
   gather you. Though you forsake Me, I will not forsake you. I will go
   before you into our old haunts, into that Galilee of the Gentiles where
   I was known to preach aforetime. I will go before you into Galilee."

   29-30. But Peter said unto Him, Although allshall be offended, yet
   willnot I. And Jesus said unto him, Verily Isay unto you, that this
   day, even in this night--The day begins at sunset.

   30, 31. Before the cock crows twice, you shall deny Me thrice. But he
   spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with You, I will not deny
   You in any wise. Likewise also said they all. So Peter was not alone in
   his intense, though rash expression of attachment. They did mean, all
   of them, to stand to their Master and to die with Him, as you and I
   mean to. But do you think that we shall carry it out better than they?
   Not if our resolve, like theirs, is made in our own strength!

   32. And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane--The garden on
   the side of the hill of Olivet.

   32. And He said to His disciples, Sit here while Ipray. Eight of you
   keep watching at the garden gate to let me know when My betrayer comes.

   33. And He took with Him, Peter and James and John, and began to be
   sorely amazed, and to be very heavy. They had not seen Him in that
   state before. He seemed like one distracted, amazed--like one
   astonished out of all composure--unable to collect Himself or to
   contain Himself. And to be very heavy, as if an awful weight pressed on
   His soul.

   34. And said unto them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death:
   tarry you here and watch. These three were to make His closest
   bodyguard, to intimate to Him if any came.

   35. And He went forward a little. A stone's cast, so as to be retired
   from them.

   35, 36. And fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible,
   the hour might pass from Him. And He said, Abba, Father, all things are
   possible unto You: take away this cup from Me; nevertheless not what I
   will, but what You will That was the point of the prayer--the very pith
   and marrow of it--not what I will, but what You will.

   37. And He came and found them sleeping. Three choice guards--His bosom
   companions.

   37. And said unto Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one
   hour? Matthew and Luke tell us that He said, "Could you not watch with
   Me one hour?" And Mark tells us here that He especially said that to
   Peter. Now remember that Mark is the Gospel of Peter. No doubt Mark was
   the great friend of Peter, and writes his Gospel from Peter's point of
   view, so Peter, in the Gospel of Mark records the worst things about
   himself. And only he puts it here that the Master said, "Simon, do you
   sleep?" Bad enough for the others to be asleep, but, "Simon, do you
   sleep? Could not you watch one hour?"

   38. Watch andpray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit truly is
   ready, but the flesh is weak. Oh, that was a kind excuse to make for
   them--to say something good about them, even though they slept when
   they ought to have comforted Him! He did see that their spirit was
   ready, but the flesh was weak.

   39. 40. And again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.
   And when He returned, He found them asleep again, (for their eyes were
   heavy), neither knew they what to answer Him. How could they excuse
   their conduct? A second time asleep! They were in a muddled state.

   41. And He came the third time, and said unto them, Sleep on now, and
   take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come. Behold, the Son of Man
   is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

"The Zeal of the Lord"

   (No. 3432)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this." Isaiah 9:7.

   BEYOND all controversy, this is a most remarkable text. Zeal is an
   attribute which is attributable to man--we do not often think or speak
   of the zeal of the Lord of Hosts! At first sight, it might seem to be a
   misplaced word--God's zeal, the Divine arm, the fervency of the
   Infinite. Yet, if we think a little as we commune together tonight, I
   do not doubt but that much of comfort will cluster round the word, "The
   zeal of the Lord of Hosts." When I turn to Holy Writ, I do not find
   that, in connection with the Creation, the word, zeal, was ever
   used--and yet it was a glorious work, to make ten thousand, thousand
   worlds, to fill space with ponderous orbs, before whose dimensions
   human imagination, itself, is staggered! It was no small work to make
   this world, with all its varieties of skill and art, adaptation and
   beauty. The morning stars might well sing together at the sight of it,
   and burst forth into a new hymn, as the light first shone upon this,
   our planet. But the Lord seems to have done it much at His ease. In six
   days He finished it and rested from all His work. No element of
   hardness, no token of zeal! Indeed, what is there in the mere creative
   act to awaken those marvelous attributes which dwell in the bosom of
   the Infinite Jehovah? Wisdom? Why, it is but the play of wisdom! Power?
   It was but a mere freak of power. There is such boundless power in God,
   that all that He has created is but a drop in the bucket, and as a very
   little thing, compared with Him! Nor, if I remember rightly, does the
   idea ever come up in connection with the sustaining of worlds and the
   guiding of the events of Providence. It is true, He calls them all by
   their names, and by the greatness of His power, not one fails. Arcturus
   with his sons, Mazzaroth in his season, the Pleiades in their
   delightful influences--all these are swayed and governed by Him! But we
   find not that He was awakened up to zeal at all concerning them. And in
   the wonders of Providence which have been worked upon earth, it is
   remarkable how gently, how easily Jehovah seems to take them! Look at
   that splendid work at the Red Sea--a work which God, Himself, seems to
   have selected as a masterpiece of His skill and of His power, for even
   in Heaven they sing the Song of Moses, the servant of God, and of the
   Lamb--that song, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously;
   the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." But how did He
   accomplish that stupendous work? "You did blow with Your wind, the sea
   covered them; they sank like lead in her mighty waters." No enthusiasm,
   no stirring up of strength--just the tender breath of His mouth and it
   is all done--and the chivalry of Egypt sinks into the middle of the
   sea! Nor when I hear of angels being formed of the Lord, whenever that
   event may have taken place, do I hear of anything like the zeal of the
   Lord in connection therewith. Nor even the creation of Adam, when He
   took the man and placed him in the garden to till it. I pray I may use
   no expression which will dishonor the Most High, yet when we speak of
   Him, we are obliged to use language according to the analogies of human
   kind. It seems to me that when God created mere materialism, there was
   nothing to excite the Divine mind beyond a mere complacency when He
   looked upon it and said, "It was very good." And when He created pure
   spirits that were incapable of singing such as angels, He rejoiced to
   see their happiness, but inasmuch as they could not have communion with
   Him, being so good as not to know good or evil, His soul does not seem
   to have been stirred. But He desired, if I may use such language
   concerning Him, to have a race of beings surrounding Him who should
   know both good and evil, who should know evil by having practically
   fallen into it, having so smarted under it as to know it to be evil in
   a practical and experimental sense--a race of creatures who should,
   from henceforth, never choose evil, who should voluntarily choose that
   which is good forever and forever because they should be so bound to
   Him, the source of all goodness, by an overwhelming obligation of love,
   that while they know evil, they shall bewail it--while they understand
   what it is to sin, they shall never, throughout eternity, either in
   thought or imagination, defile themselves with sin, but shall remain
   immaculately perfect through the constraint of a love which He shall
   reveal toward them, which shall be sufficient to wash their robes and
   make them white, world without end! It seems to me that He desired to
   have a race of creatures that should not be like angels or a race of
   creatures apart from Himself--but a race that should be His sons, that
   should be mysterious and wonderful--and His plan was this, that Jesus,
   His only Son, should come into this world and take upon Himself the
   flesh and nature of fallen creatures, that in that flesh He should die
   and put away the guilt of all their sin, and that by His flesh, when
   risen, He should establish a link between them and God, so that there
   should be nothing between God and man. God blessed first forever, and
   then Jesus, the Man, positively and really a Man, clinging by His
   Manhood through His Godhead to those chosen creatures whom He should
   have purified and made clean, who should forever exist, the children of
   God, partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the corruption
   which is in the world through lust. It is not for me--it is not for
   anyoneto strike out the Divine idea and say this is what God meant and
   intended, but we have enough of Scripture to let us say that this was a
   part of His aim, at any rate, that in Jesus Christ there should be a
   race of creatures distinct from all others, because actually alive with
   the Deity--creatures who, to use the expression of the serpent, should
   "be as gods, knowing good and evil," and be as gods always and forever,
   preferring the good, though they have tasted the evil, and might have
   chosen it, but were constrained by Divine Grace to bewail it and,
   henceforth, to keep close to God, world without end!

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, it was such a plan as this that awoke the
   zeal of God! This was what could not have been done by mere power, but
   must bring forth all the attributes of God--the work that had to be
   achieved here was worthy of a great Creator--it was a work which would
   reveal the Deity as no other work had ever done and, therefore, if I
   may use the expression (I have often to excuse myself, not to you, but
   to Him), He seems to brace Himself up to a display of all the Divine
   Energy and Almighty Omnipotence, to accomplish His purpose, to carry
   out His plan and make Jesus the King of a chosen company! "The zeal of
   the Lord of Hosts shall perform this."

   I. GOD ENTERS INTO THE PLAN OF GLORIFYING CHRIST AND MAKING TO HIMSELF
   A PEOPLE

   WITH GREAT ZEAL.

   This can be proved in the following way--we judge of a man's zeal when
   the purpose has been long in His heart, and He has most industriously
   followed it through a long period. Now, the plan of Grace through Jesus
   Christ was in the eternal heart before the worlds were made. He had it
   all in His mind. Hence He speaks of Christ as "the Lamb slain from
   before the foundation of the world," and never once has the Divine mind
   turned aside from this purpose. Think, then, what zeal God must have
   towards the achievement of this design, when through these long ages,
   as we call them, He has still resolved to push on the work which He
   determined to do. Think, again, that all the agents of Providence that
   have ever occurred on this globe have had an eye to that purpose--from
   the little up to the great. When He set the bounds of the people, He
   set them according to the children of Israel. He had an eye to the
   people of His love and to the Son of His choice, even when He was
   mapping out the territories which the different races should inhabit
   and not a king has fallen from His throne, not an army has devastated a
   province, no changes of government, no challenges of race have ever
   taken place apart from the Divine intent--that He would set His Son
   upon His holy hill of Zion, and make Him to be a King over all the
   nations of the earth. To that purpose God has steadily adhered all this
   while and, therefore, I honor "the zeal of the Lord of Hosts."

   Just think a moment, and I will show you God must be zealous in this
   matter. Behold, His Son stoops to become a Man. You see Him lying as a
   Baby in Bethlehem's manger. You behold Him as a Youth obedient to His
   parents, as a full-grown Man, a Servant of servants in His toil. Now,
   when the Lord looks down upon His Son, how He must resolve to glorify
   Him! Oh, what must be the thought in that fraternal bosom! Does My Son
   thus stoop? Does He take such a Nature into union with Himself? Oh, I
   will crown His head with many crowns! For all His stoopings He shall
   have a glory. Does He sit there at a harlot's side at the well of
   Samaria? Does He sit there at the table with publicans and sinners?
   Does He go down to bear the sorrows of the sins of men? God seems to
   declare by Himself that He will give Him a name that is above every
   name--for all His stooping He shall have an exaltation--the name at
   which every knee shall bow, even the name of Jesus, and every tongue
   shall confess that He is Lord to the Glory of God the Father!

   Or, look further through your tears, behold the wondrous Sacrifice of
   Calvary. Can you behold Jesus, smarting, suffering, bleeding,
   dying--and can you imagine God looking on, a regular spectator? Oh, no!
   If we may suppose Him to be capable of passions like ourselves, we
   shall have to say, as He looked upon His dying Son, He vowed that He
   would lift

   His head above the sons of men, and make Him see a numerous seed to
   recompense His pain. If anything could make a man zealous in his cause,
   it would be to see it stained with the best blood on earth, to see it
   stained with his own son's blood! Surely a man would say, I consecrate
   myself over the blood of my child to live and die, to honor the name
   that was thus put to shame for my purpose, my design. And God says the
   same! The zeal of God burned at Calvary!

   Think again. Jesus Christ at this moment is everywhere dishonored.
   Millions use Christ's name in superstition, worshipping a crucifix,
   making a God out of the very images. Multitudes of people practice
   idolatry, enshrine and adore false deities, and what does God say? Do
   you think that He looks on like Jove, fabled among the heathen an
   impassive spectator? Oh, it is not so! He hears the blasphemies of men!
   He sees their sins and though He keeps His right hand in His bosom and
   we sometimes say, "Now, where is Your zeal and the soundings of Your
   heart," it is only because He is Divine and can put a Divine restraint
   upon His zeal that He does not rise at once and sweep away the idols
   and devastate the nations! His long-suffering makes Him wait. His pity
   bids Him tarry. But the day shall come--and it draws near--when with
   the hammer, He shall break in pieces, and with the iron rod He shall
   dash, like a potter's vessel, the usurpers who dare to stand in
   Christ's way and to take away the Kingdom from the rightful heir! Yet
   the very sins of men are stirring up the Lord and their iniquities,
   transgressions and blasphemies are almost exciting His holy soul,
   making a zeal to burn within Him which, one of these days, in the set
   time, will perform its work!

   Only one more proof on this point, and it is this--Brothers and
   Sisters, we become zealous when we hear the cries and tears of the
   oppressed. I think I see a senator standing on the floor of the House
   of Commons, pleading, in years gone by, the cause of Africa's
   down-trodden sons. I do not wonder at the zeal of Wilberforce, or the
   marvelous eloquence of Fox. What a cause they had! They could hear the
   clanging of the fetters of the slaves, the sighs of prisoners, the
   shrieks of women--and this made them speak, for they burned with an
   indignation which carried them away! Pity pulled up the sluices of
   their speech and their souls ran out in mighty torrents of overwhelming
   eloquence! Now, think. The Lord this day hears the sighs of the
   oppressed all over the world. He hears the sighs of the sorrowful and,
   beyond that there comes up the daily cries of His elect, who day and
   night beseech His Throne. Oh, that we were more clamorous! Oh, that we
   were more intensely importunate! Oh, that we gave Him no rest until He
   would establish and make Jerusalem a praise on the earth, for, remember
   the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, "And shall not God avenge His
   own elect? Though they cry night and day unto Him, I tell you He will
   avenge them speedily."

   You see, then, proofs of God's zeal and the source of it, if we may use
   such a term. It is His purpose, a purpose to which He has kept so long.
   His zeal is, moreover, excited by Christ's humiliation, by the
   blasphemies and sins of men and by the tears of His people. God is not
   as we are--cold, insensible. He is full of zeal! And in the great good
   old cause, which shall, at last, win the day, there may be zealous
   partisans, but none is so zealous as the Lord of Hosts! A Master in the
   midst of Israel! We will now change the strain, and notice the second
   point. The text says His zeal will perform it. That is to say--

   II. HIS ZEAL WILL PERFORM THE SETTING OF CHRIST UPON HIS KINGDOM AND
   THE ESTABLISHING OF IT FOREVER.

   But it will perform everything that has to do with that Kingdom. God's
   zeal will not leave a single jot or tittle of the Covenant of His Grace
   unfulfilled. He has lifted His hand. He has sworn by Himself that
   Christ shall see of the travail of His soul--and the zeal of God will
   carry this out!

   Notice, then, Brother and Sisters, tonight, first, that the Lord will
   secure the salvation of all His chosen. Nothing else could secure it
   but God's own zeal. The zeal of all the Church could not secure it. Men
   might perish, notwithstanding every act, but God knows them who are
   His, and He will find them! If there are some of them, tonight, plunged
   into the depths of sin, or others far gone in Atheism or unbelief, the
   zeal of God will find every blood-bought one, and Christ shall have
   every single soul that the Father gave Him--and that He redeemed with
   blood from among men. Oh, there is joy in this! But we cannot stay to
   think of it.

   This secures, in the next place, the spread of the Truth of God.
   Sometimes we sit down and say, "Truth, though mighty in itself, does
   not prevail among a godless generation set upon their idols." And
   oftentimes we mourn and lament because the battle has turned against
   the Lord. But, Brothers and Sisters, God's Truth is wide enough and
   safe enough-- we need not weep over a few defeats! God has ordained
   that the laurels of the King are all safe! He has trodden the winepress
   alone, but the victory is sure to Him! We have but to keep on in the
   patience and tribulation of the saints till the set time shall come,
   and every Truth that God has declared shall be crowned and honored.
   Wisdom is justified of all her children, and the Infinite Wisdom of
   Jesus shall be justified in all His teaching. But the grand meaning is
   this--that the day is sure to come when all the nations shall be
   converted unto God! I am not going into any pre-millennial or
   post-millennial theories. I am neither a Prophet nor the son of a
   Prophet, but if there is anything plain in Scripture, it seems to be
   this--that there is a Kingdom of Christ, that there will be a reign of
   Christ over the people, that the Son of David shall rule the Kingdom,
   from the rivers even to the ends of the earth--they that dwell in the
   wilderness shall bow before Him, the heathen shall come and lick the
   dust at His feet and He shall be King of kings and Lord of lords! "The
   zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this," says the text. I thank
   the Master for that word. All the missionary societies in the world
   will never know how to perform it! If they were strengthened to the
   uttermost, they would never be able to achieve this work. Not all the
   ministry will ever be able to perform this. Nor do I see any means
   adapted to achieve so sublime an end. Why, the population is increasing
   upon Christianity. We do not hold our own. Relatively, to the
   population, I suppose, there are not so many believers in Christ,
   today, as there were a hundred years ago. We are going backward instead
   of forward. See, you sons of men, your zeal and your earnestness--no,
   your lackof zeal and your lackof earnestness-- see what it will come
   to! Poor, vain instruments, what can we perform? But in the rear there
   is One who will do it! As in the days of battle, when the front ranks
   are beaten, and one rank after another is driven back, up comes the old
   guards-- and they never quail and know not how to say retreat--and so
   they win the day! Now, behold a greater than all the hosts of men, the
   Eternal Ages, the Ancient of Days, the Infinite, Himself, shall bring
   up His servants in the day of battle! And He shall thunder gloriously!
   The Gospel shall be proclaimed! The Kingdom shall be won! Christ shall
   reign and the "Hallelujah" shall come up unto the Lord Omnipotent, who
   not only gets the Kingdom, but gets it by His own power, wins by His
   own zeal! "The Lord of Hosts, the Lord of Hosts shall perform this."
   Now, our last word is practical--

   III. THE PRACTICAL TEACHING WHICH ARISES OUT OF THIS TRUTH.

   The expression of the text is only used four times in Scripture. One of
   these is a repetition of another. Virtually it is only used three
   times--in Isaiah 63:15, "the zeal of the lord of Hosts" is used, as I
   have already used it, as an argument for prayer. God is thus addressed,
   "Where is Your zeal, and the sounding of your heart, and of Your
   mercies towards me? Are they restrained?" What a plea in prayer for us
   tomorrow night! O God convert the sons of men! Put an end to blasphemy
   and sin. If You do not, we have heard of Your zeal, but where is Your
   zeal? You can do it--why don't You do it? You can save. The hardest
   heart will yield to You. The rod of iron and steel shall be broken by
   the iron of the Cross. Oh God, where, where, where is Your zeal? Have
   You forgotten the great Fall and the Kingdom, and the Covenant, and
   Your oath? Have You forgotten Your Son--His griefs, His merits--Your
   promised recompense to Him? Where is Your zeal? Oh, but this is a
   battering ram with which to shake the very gates of Heaven! Men of
   prayer and faith, learn how to use this! The next time you are
   wrestling with the Angel, if you would overcome Him, here is the master
   plea, "Where is Your zeal, and the sounding of your heart?" Let us thus
   flee to God!

   But the text may be used, in the second place, as a ground of hope. If
   you turn to Isaiah 37:32, you will see that there it is used in
   relation to the salvation of a remnant--the remnant of Judah. When you
   and I feel ourselves to be like a remnant, cut off, and put away--when
   we feel ourselves to be unworthy of the Divine notice, let us recollect
   that God is zealous to save His remnant and let us ask Him to save
   us--and appeal to the very zeal of God to give salvation to us who need
   it so much!

   But not to dwell longer on this part of the subject, I am sure you will
   perceive that our text, practically, is a good reason for confidence.
   You begin to be dispirited in God's work--it ought not to be so. If any
   of you are ready to give up your Sunday school work, or whatever it is
   you are engaged in, oh, say not so! God is so zealous that He will not
   let the good cause fail. There may be, as there will be in every great
   battle, a certain sort of temporary defeat which may be but a retiring
   of the troops, that they may the more sternly and successfully advance
   again to the front. So is it with the Cross of Christ. There are slight
   repulses, but everything is working to ultimate victory. Look at the
   sea as it comes up towards flood and then the waves retire. A child
   might sit down and weep, and say, "I thought the sea was coming up to
   here, but look, it has gone back again, and it has not washed my feet."
   In the long run the sea is still coming up, and it is thus a type of
   the good cause of Christ! Our lives are but like seconds in the tide of
   this great time of ours, which is itself but a second in the great
   duration of eternity! Because the good old cause does not seem to
   prosper for a single day and the Kingdom does not come to Christ in my
   short life, shall I sit down and weep? No, I am but one among millions
   who shallachieve the Divine Purpose--one little coral insect, helping
   to pile up the rock on which, by-and-by, shall grow the cedar and the
   palm tree and the lovely flowers! And the winds shall waft across it
   insects in every gale--I will do my work, though it is beneath the
   waves! I will do my work and die--and others shall do the same, but the
   rock is rising and God's Purpose is being accomplished! In the words of
   the Prayer of Moses, "Let Your work appear unto Your servants, and Your
   Glory unto their children." Lord, let us take the work and give our
   children the glory! Let us work on--they shall live to see the Glory!
   Some future generation shall see the triumph. And the best of it all
   is, we shall see it, too, for it will be but a sleep between now and
   then--a little leaning upon the Savior's bosom in our disembodied
   state--and then the trumpet shall ring so shrill and clear through
   Heaven and earth and we shall come to dwell again in these bodies of
   ours, restored and rendered fit for purified spirit to dwell in! And
   our eyes shall see in that day, the God that died for us, and oh, how
   we will adore Him and magnify Him! And we will say together, the cause
   for which we struggled, the Kingdom for which we fought, has come at
   last! It was a long day and a weary one, and we feared the Master would
   not come. Some of us fell asleep before His appearing, but we awaken at
   the knocks at the door--we awaken even with the blessed sleepers, and
   we come to see the triumph as we once of old saw the praise! Glory be
   to God, the victory is secure! Let us work on till then.

   But last of all, if God is thus zealous for the crown rights, the
   Kingdom of Christ, let us be zealous, too. This is not the day of
   zeal--this is the day of cleverness and achievement. It is not the day
   of solid earnestness--it is the day of mere sensationalism and nothing
   more. Oh, what a sight it would have been to have seen old John Knox,
   when old and worn, go up into his pulpit, and though before he began to
   preach, he seemed so weak that he could scarcely stand, yet he did not
   proceed far in preaching up the Master's name, before, as an old
   historian says, "He did seem to use such force that one would think he
   would dash the pulpit into fragments"--dash it into shivers, I suppose,
   before the Popish priests and hypocrites of the age! How his eyes
   flashed fire as he spoke out his Master's truth, as he denounced Popery
   and held up the Truths of God and the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus! We
   need more men of this sort! Oh, that God would but send us one, such,
   and then to back him, a race of Covenanters who would, with their very
   blood dedicate themselves to the Truth and the Kingdom of Christ
   against the insidious advances of Popery and the infidelity of Rome and
   Hell, which are twin brothers! Oh, that once again the Church were
   earnest to have no head or king of the Church but Christ, no creed but
   the Bible, no Baptism but the Baptism which He has taught, no sacrament
   but what He reveals, no Doctrine but what that book dictates--the
   Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible! May we come back to
   this in purity, to this with earnestness, and then it will not be long
   before we shall hear Him coming in the chariot, paved with love for the
   daughters of Jerusalem and we shall go forth to meet Him, even to meet
   King Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the
   day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart! Oh,
   God of Zeal, drop Your zeal upon us, now, and make us zealous, too,
   even we, redeemed by blood, by Your Holy Spirit, inhabit and consecrate
   us afresh, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 40:1-17; 25-31; JOHN1:29-42.

   Verses 1, 2. Comfort you, comfort you My people, says your God. Speak
   you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is
   accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of
   the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.God would have His people
   happy. He knows that we are not in strong, vigorous state, neither do
   we honor His name while we are lacking in holy joy. Let the sinners be
   uncomfortable. Let them be "like the troubled sea that cannot rest."
   But as for God's people, it is His great joy that they should be happy.
   He bids His servants again and again to comfort them! Sometimes we are
   in a condition of warfare and we are under the chastising rod, but now
   the Lord appears graciously to His servants, and He says, "Your warfare
   is over: your chastisement is ended." Now the Lord returns in mercy and
   He grants a sense of forgiven sin.

   3. The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way
   of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.You know
   this was John the Baptist coming to proclaim the Savior. That was the
   best comfort God's people could have--the coming of the Lord. So it is
   now. The joy of the Church is the coming of the Lord! And toeach one of
   us the greatest source of joy is the drawing near to us of our Lord. If
   He appears to us, our winter is over, our summer's sun has come! If
   Christ is with us, the time of the singing of birds has come and our
   heart is glad.

   4, 5. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
   be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
   places, plain: And the Glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all
   flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it
   Wherever Christ comes, it is so. All things are right at His appearing
   and if the Lord but manifests Himself to us tonight, each one, we shall
   find the crooked things made straight. We shall see the mountains of
   difficulty, leveled, and the deep depressions will all be filled up and
   there will be a causeway along which the Lord triumphantly shall ride
   to display the greatness of His power! There is nothing that shall
   hinder the coming of the Lord to us, and when He comes, there is
   nothing that shall stand against Him!

   6-8. The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is
   grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the fields.
   The grass withers, the flower fades because the breath of the LORD
   blows upon it: surely the people are grass. The grass withers, the
   flower fades: but the Word of our God shall stand forever Now that is a
   cry that we all need to hear--the death cry of all creature
   confidence--for man at his very best is only like grass and the flower.
   They will be mown down in due time, but if the scythe comes not near
   them, yet will they fade in their season, for they are transient things
   and every hope and confidence which is based upon that which is seen,
   must be temporal and must pass away. All the joy that you have
   tonight--all the hope and all the confidence you have which is based
   upon an earthly thing-- must, by degrees, all disappear. Nothing is
   eternal but that which springs out of the Eternal. Unless our hope is
   in the Lord, alone, that hope will at some time or other fail us! This
   is a cry we need to hear because, until we are sick of the creature, we
   shall not turn to the Creator! Till we have done with false
   confidences, we shall not make God our trust!

   9. O Zion, that brings good tidings, get you up into the high mountain!
   O Jerusalem, that brings good tidings, lift up your voice with
   strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah,
   Behold your God! Look away from these fading things and behold your
   God. Look away from the brightest joy you have, though it is like the
   meadow, all alive with many colored flowers, and look to your God, and
   to your God, alone! "Behold your God"--your God in Christ! Your God who
   has come through the wilderness, making a highway for Himself, that He
   may come to you. Rejoice in Christ, your Savior, and you shall have a
   joy that never shall be taken from you!

   10. 11. Behold, the Lord God will come with a strong hand, and His arm
   shall rule for Him: behold, His rewards are with Him, and His work
   before Him. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd. Do you belong to
   the flock tonight? Then let this comfort you. Never mind about the
   fading flowers. "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd." He has
   brought you into the pasture tonight. Depend upon it, He has not led
   you by a wrong way. And now, though your soul is hungry and thirsty,
   you shall not lack, for, "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd."

   11. He shall gather the lambs with His arm. The feeblest, first. The
   most care for those that need most care. "He shall gather the lambs
   with His arm."

   11. And carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those that are
   with young. Your sorrow is to come. It is known to yourself alone. None
   can sympathize with you. He will gently lead you. There is no
   overdriving with Christ. Sometimes His ministers, in order to get God's
   people right, one way, overdrive them another, and it is possible while
   rebuking the hypocrite, to cause grief to the sincere Believer, but our
   Lord is a better Shepherd than the under shepherds are at their very
   best. "He shall gather the lambs with His arm, carry them in His bosom,
   and shall gently lead those that are with young." Oh, what a blessed
   Helper we have! Let us rest in Him.

   12-17. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted
   out Heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
   measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
   balance? Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being His
   counselor, has taught Him? With whom took He counsel, and who
   instructed Him and taught Him in the path of judgment, and taught Him
   knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding? Behold, the
   nations are as a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of
   the balance. Behold, He takes up the isles as a very little thing. And
   Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient
   for a burnt offering. All nations before Him are as nothing: and they
   are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity. Who would not trust
   such a God as this--this only God? How well may we be content to turn
   away from the fading creatures to this eternal Lord and put our trust
   in Him! Indeed, the wonder is that we trust the creature and do not
   trust the mighty Creator! Faith, which seems so difficult, after all,
   is nothing better than sanctified commonsense! It is the most
   commonsensething in all the world to trust in Omnipotence--in infinite,
   unchanging love--in Infallible Truth. To trust anywhere else needs a
   great deal of justification, but to trust in God needs no apology. He
   well deserves it. O My soul, trust you in

   Him!

   25, 26. To whom, then, willyou liken Me, or shall Ibe equal? says the
   Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and behold who has created these
   things that bring out their host by number: He calls them all by names
   by the greatness of His might for that He is strong in power; not one
   is missing. There is no other power that hangs yon lamps of Heaven in
   their places and keeps them always burning, except the power of His
   Word! This whole round earth of ours hangs on nothing but the bidding
   of the Most High. I remember how Luther used to console himself in
   troublous times by saying, "Look at yonder arch of blue. There is not a
   pillar to hold it up, and yet, whoever saw the skies fall?" Nothing but
   the power of God keeps them up. My Soul, if all the worlds were made by
   His Word, cannot you hang on that Word? If all things exist but by the
   will and Word of your Father, can He not support you, and can you not
   trust Him? Oh, this confidence in the invisible and eternal ought to be
   natural to us as God's children! But, alas, here is our great sin--that
   we frequently trust in an arm of flesh and forget our God!

   27. Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from
   the LORD, and my judgment ispassed over from my God?He forgets no star
   among the myriads, no creature among the multitudes. He has marked in
   His book the track of every single atom of air and every particle of
   dust, and every drop of spray--how can you be forgotten?

   28, 29. Have you not known?Have you not heard that the everlasting God,
   the LORD, the Creator ofthe ends of the earth faints not, neither is
   weary? There is no searching of His understanding. He gives power to
   the faint. He loves to pour out into empty vessels. He does not give
   His power to the strong, but, "He gives power to the faint," and the
   more faint you are, the more room for His strength. Trust in Him! If
   you are so burdened that you cannot stand, lean on Him! The more you
   lean, the better will He love you. He delights to help His people. "He
   gives power to the faint."

   29- 30. And to them that have no might He increases strength. Even the
   youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly
   fall.We sometimes wish that we were as young as some, and that we had
   all their overflowing spirit--all the effervescence of their juvenile
   ardor. Ah, well, we need not wish for it, for mere mortal power shall
   droop and die--and earthly vigor cease--while such as trust the Lord
   shall find their strength increased. "Even the youths shall faint and
   be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall."

   31. But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength: they
   shall mount up with wings as eagles--That is very much when they begin.
   They are all for flying and God gives them a glorious flight, and they
   are so happy and so delighted. But they will do better than that!

   31. They shall run, and not be weary. Is that better than flying? Yes
   it is--a better pace to keep up, but God enables His servants at length
   to stay along the road of duty and to run in it. But there is even a
   better pace than that!

   31. And they shall walk and not faint. It is a good steady pace. It is
   the pace that Enoch kept when he walked with God. Sometimes it is
   easier to take a running spurt than it is to keep on, day by day--walk,
   walk, walk in the sobriety of Christian conversation. Many under
   excitement can run a race, but it is the best of all to be able to
   steadily to walk on, walking with God the Lord. The Lord bring us to
   that pace! "They shall walk and not faint."

   JOHN129-42.

   Verse 29. The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said, Behold
   the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.John lost no
   time. He had no sooner discovered the Savior than he bore witness of
   Him. "The next day." As soon as ever his eyes lighted upon Jesus, he
   had his testimony ready for Him. "Behold!" he said, "the Lamb of God."

   30- 33. This is He of whom Isaid, After me comes a Man which
   ispreferred before me: for He was before me. AndI knew Him not: but
   that He should manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with
   water. And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
   Heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not. At
   first.

   33, 34. But He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto
   me, Upon whom you shallsee the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him,
   the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I saw and bare
   record, that this is the Son of God.Notice how very clear John is.
   There is no mistaking him. He repeated himself lest there should be any
   possibility of an error. And he gives the detail of the mode by which
   he recognized the Savior, in order that all might be persuaded to
   accept Jesus as in very truth the Messiah and the Son of God! And so we
   are to preach very plainly--not with enticing words of men's
   wisdom--but with demonstration of the Spirit and with power. What have
   we to conceal? No, we have everything to reveal and our business is
   that men should be convinced that Jesus is the Christ--and should come
   and put their trust in Him.

   35, 36. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples,
   and looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of
   God!There is no objection to preaching the same sermon twice if it is
   on such a matter as this! "Behold the Lamb of God," he said one day.
   And the next day he did not vary the phraseology. He had no new
   metaphor-- no new figure with which to set forth Christ, but, as
   striking a nail upon the head and the same nail will help to fasten it,
   and may do more service than bringing out a new nail, so he gets to the
   same word and the same subject--"Behold the

   Lamb of God."

   37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
   They went beyond their teacher. And oh, what a mercy it is if our
   hearers can go Christward far beyond us! John was well content to be
   left behind if they followed Jesus, and so may any minister of Christ
   rejoice if his people will follow Jesus, even if they go far beyond his
   attainments.

   38. Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and said unto them, What
   do you seek?Christ wants intelligent followers, so He asks the
   question, "What do you seek?"

   38, 39. They said unto Him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted,
   Master), where do You dwell?He said unto them, Come and see.Which is
   often His answer to enquirers--"Come and see." "Oh, taste and see that
   the Lord is good." Learn by experience. Do not merely hear what I say,
   but come and see.

   39-42. They came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day,
   for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak
   and followed Him, was Andre w, Simon Peter's brother. He first found
   his own brother, Simon, and said unto him, We have found the Messiah,
   which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus.
   This is how the Kingdom began to grow--by individual effort. "Andrew
   found Simon"--one convert must bring another--"and He brought Him to
   Jesus."

   42. And when Jesus beheld him, He said, You are Simon, the son of
   Jonah. You shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A
   Stone.There was a meaning in the change of names, for there was about
   to be a change of character-- the timid son of a dove soon to become a
   very rock for the Church!

Love's Reward

   (No. 3433)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him. I
   will set him on high because he has known My name." Psalm 91:14.

   THAT this Psalm was written by David we see no reason to doubt. In the
   previous verses we have the words of the Psalmist himself. Here,
   however, there is a change of speaker. The promise is spoken by God,
   Himself, in these three closing sentences. Doubtless the words of
   Inspired men are very precious as a Divine testimony, but when God,
   Himself, directly speaks to us in His own name, what an extraordinary
   weight attaches to every syllable He utters! Dear child of God, you who
   are a believer in Jesus, can you not think that you hear your God
   saying, concerning you, with His own, gracious assuring voice, "Because
   he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him"? And notice
   that He repeats these words, "I will," four times, as if to give them
   the most striking emphasis! Surely this is intended to minister some
   comfort and refreshing to the Lord's people. I pray the Holy Spirit,
   the Comforter, to give the Word and to apply it.

   "Because," says the Most High, "he has set his love upon Me." We must
   look at this carefully, for it contains a description of character. If
   we can find ourselves classified here, it will be well for us,
   otherwise we shall have reason for deep anxiety. Is our love set upon
   God? Search your hearts, for the question is very pungent. The original
   Hebrew has more force in it than our translation expresses, although I
   do not know exactly how to improve upon our version. The idea, however,
   is something like this--"To have fallen in love"--as though with all
   the tenderness of passion and all the transport of devotion, the
   creature yearned for his Creator, and mortal man cherished an intense
   affection for the eternal God.

   I. THE HEART'S SUPREME LOVE.

   "He has set his love upon Me." His love! Such love as draws the
   sympathies with its irresistible attraction, as brightens the thoughts
   with its fervent glow, as knits the heart with its indissoluble bonds!
   Yes, such love as melts the soul with its potent charms. I would have
   you think of it, now, as a fact, not as a fiction, or a fancy. That
   word, love, is translatable into the many tongues of earth, and so it
   passes current among the millions in every age and every clime. But
   only hearts attuned can feel it--it finds echo only in the purest
   minds. But, to explain it, why, one had need combine a poet's genius
   with the emotions of a child, a husband or wife, a parent, a friend,
   all earthly relations in one to paint genuine love in living language!
   And even then it were all felt, and little, very little, told! Oh, but
   this is a high matter, for a man to set his love upon God! His
   love--not a cold sentiment, not a languid approbation, not a mild
   complacency, not any mere formal respect, but love, burning love,
   which, like coals ofjuniper, give forth a vehement flame--"his love set
   upon God," like a river that is set upon its course to the sea, its
   volume always swelling, its tide becoming more and more rapid.

   Answer now, dear Hearer, can you say that you have set your love upon
   God? If so, you have been the subject of a great change--a mysterious
   transformation--for your heart was naturally at enmity to God, and the
   instincts of your mind and the desires of the flesh were alien to Him.
   Look back. Compare your present self with your former self and consider
   the difference. If you were not, in your unregenerate state, in active
   hostility to God, yet you were indifferent towards Him. God was not in
   all your thoughts. You could rise at morn and lay down to rest at night
   without enquiring after God. You could go forth to your work and labor,
   and return to seek your recreation without seeking or acknowledging God
   in all your ways. Gladly would you try even to suffer, to die upon the
   bed of sickness when called to it, struggling with weakness, confiding
   in the physician's skill--without appealing to God your Creator and
   your Preserver! This was your natural state, the bent and bias of your
   perverse will! And in such waywardness you would have continued to this
   hour if the free, rich, undeserved Sovereign efficacious Grace of God
   had not interposed! Is your love now set upon God? Then a great change
   has passed over you as though a dead man had been quickened into life!
   As though the darkness of midnight had been suddenly turned to the
   brightness of midday! A great wonder of Grace, a miracle of saving
   mercy has been worked in you!

   Though you must know to whom it is to be ascribed, let me refresh your
   memory, awhile, that I may awaken your gratitude. Comes not this of the
   Lord, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working? Depend upon
   it, only He who made you, could make you new! Only that Voice which
   brought light out of darkness, and order out of chaos, could have
   dispelled your vain infatuations or inflamed your soul with love, and
   made your known apathy and aversion give place to a sacred ardor and a
   devout affection! Surely the Kingdom of God has come near unto you!
   Salvation has come to your house! The Lord has looked upon you and
   spoken to you! The Eternal Spirit has brooded over your dull faculties
   and, as it were, by the breath of God's mouth you have been
   regenerated! You are born-again, not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible--by the Word of God which lives and abides forever.
   Therefore you are in Christ, a new creature! Revolve these things in
   your soul, this array of lively blessings, that your gratitude may
   bloom with joy in God and your praise to the Lord may burst into
   melodious song! Do I not speak of a matter which should compel the
   tongue of every redeemed man to cry, "Hosanna in the highest"? Were it
   marvelous if a thousand voices should utter a loud hallelujah?

   Your love to God is no self-sown plant. If you have set your love on
   Him, it is because He first set His love on you. What? Did your love go
   spontaneously towards God, without any constraint to violate your will?
   When He lifted upon you the light of His Countenance, and when you
   found favor in His eyes, there were charms, attractions, drawings
   conformable to the nature of your mind! There were sweet constraints of
   Divine enchantment which enamored you of the beauties of Christ--a
   potent spell of Divine persuasion which led you to listen to the voice
   of Christ and believe! And now that you have seen and known Him, you
   cannot do otherwise than love Him! God has been revealed to you in the
   Person and work of His Son, and your heart has been warmed--your
   affections have been kindled--your whole soul has been drawn towards
   Him! So the Lord observes you, and says, "He has set his love upon Me."
   Are you the man of whom God speaks? Then I ask you to avow yourself to
   yourself and to your God, now, in the presence of all His people.
   "Yes," you can say, "I do love my God. I cannot now live without
   thoughts of Him, nor do I wish to do so. And when, for a while, through
   pressure of care I do not turn my soul towards God, yet, when the
   pressure is removed, my mind comes back to Him, as the dove flies back
   to the dovecot, and as the needle trembles back to the pole. Never am I
   happier than when my thoughts are with my God, nor is there any thought
   so uppermost in my soul as the thought that He loves me and that,
   consequently, I desire to live in obedience to His commands, seeking
   His honor and endeavoring to promote His Glory." I, hope, Beloved, if
   the Lord Jesus were to appeal to you, as He did to His servant, Peter,
   you could stand the threefold interrogation "Do you love Me?" And you
   would answer with Peter at the last, "You know all things. You know
   that I love You." Let this love of yours, then, which you possess, be
   in your soul more and more a consuming flame! Let nothing come in to
   quench it or to dim its ardor.

   Let nothing in your conduct obscure its truthfulness. Suffer no idol to
   divide the Throne which God has claimed in your affections. Cry against
   the admission of any intruder. Beseech the Lord to stay near to you and
   to drive far away every attraction and allurement that would stir up
   rivalry in your breast. Be it your own strong resolve, in the power of
   His Spirit, that, as you do love Him, you will seek to love Him more
   and more and, till your last dying day, it shall be your soul's passion
   and master thought that God should be All-in-All enshrined within the
   heart as the bosom's Lord. "He has set his love upon Me." I think I
   hear some of you say, "Oh, that I couldlove Him! I am half afraid to
   say that I do love Him." Yet, perhaps, you are the very persons that,
   if brought to the test, would prove to be the truest lovers of your
   Savior. But I hear your inward whisper, "Though I do much that might
   make me fear and question the sincerity of my love to Him, yet, at
   times my soul's emotions get the better of these qualms, for a while,
   and speak out their fervor. Yes, my Jesus! I do love You! I do know and
   feel that You are my portion. Oh, my God, I do desire to love You more.
   I do give myself up to You." You know, Beloved, that it is not always
   easy to move the affection of love. It may be in the soul and lie there
   quietly. Though I know that I love the Savior, I remember a time when I
   was in great doubt whether I had any love to Him, till, as I listened
   to a sermon from a good Brother, the Truth he uttered so stirred my
   soul that it set the love that had been slumbering in my spirit all in
   motion and I perceived that, after all, I did love my Lord and Master,
   and had His truth near to my heart! Now, it may be that God will raise
   up something in Providence, or something in connection with some fellow
   Christian, that will cause your love to flame up and you will say
   within yourself, "There it is, afterall! I was afraid it had died." Do
   you remember when you first set your love on God? Do you remember the
   place where Jesus met with you, where the weight of sin was taken from
   you and your transgression, like a thick cloud, was blown away? Ah,
   then the Savior was very, very dear to you. You fixed your love on Him.
   Do you not remember, since then, many high times and choice occasions
   when you have renewed your vow, when your soul has stretched out her
   wings towards Jesus, and He has looked towards you, and you towards
   Him, and the love of your espousals has been restored? Oh, that it
   might be so now! But whether or not there are any flames of affection,
   let the coals burn on, and say within your spirit, "Yes, my Savior,
   beyond a doubt, I do love You and I cling to You! Better it were that
   my heart should cease to pray than cease to love You!"

   I am afraid there are some here that neither set their hearts on God
   nor care to do so. To them I can only say, God forbid that your present
   indifference should be your permanent choice! Your resolve not to love
   the God who made you, not to love the Redeemer of men, the Savior of
   sinners, the Spirit of Grace--such an obstinate resolution as that will
   involve the loss of all the privileges which belong to the lovers of
   Christ! And in that day "when the nearer waters roll, when the tempest
   rages high," you may regret, when it is too late, that you rejected
   that Jesus who, as Lover of our souls, can alone find us a haven from
   the storm and protect us from the wrath to come. You know, after all,
   that they are happiest who love God the best. I can only pray for you
   that His Spirit may teach you wisdom and lead you to renounce your
   culpable indifference and your wicked aversion--and draw you into the
   fellowship of those who have set their love upon God. Now we must pass
   on. Is our love set? Then the next thing we have to notice is--

   II. GOD'S LOVE PROVED TO THE LOVING HEART.

   "Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him."
   Rightly understood, this savors not of human merit, but of Divine
   Mercy. The possession of this love reflects no credit on the creature,
   but the production of it redounds to the praise of the Creator. He that
   gives Grace for Grace adds here another golden link to the chain of His
   own loving kindnesses when He says, "I will deliver him." By what
   gentle ways does a mother fondle her baby till the wee child clings to
   her? And to no stranger's arms will it go without a scream! The mother
   is pleased. She presses the infant to her breast and she says, "You
   sweet, affectionate little thing, I will take care of you. Nobody shall
   hurt you." Even so, Beloved, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will
   I comfort you," says the Lord. There is more than a mother's tenderness
   in our heavenly Father's heart! Come, you children of God, take this
   gracious Word from your Father's lips, and let your souls be satisfied
   with fatness as you feed on it, "I will deliver him." Does it not mean
   that He will defend you from all your foes and all your fears? Are you
   exposed to ridicule, slander, persecution, tyranny? Or are you teased
   and tormented with the fawning looks, the treacherous words, the
   cunning devices, the gaudy allurements of those who would beguile you?
   Fear not their faces, whether they frown or smile! Cling to your own
   Protector, for thus says the Lord, "I will deliver you." Your worst
   enemies are evil spirits, able to tempt you in many ways, and to suit
   their devices to your weaknesses--fear them not, for even the Prince of
   the power of the air, though he comes against you with all his fiery
   darts at once, shall not prevail to destroy you, since it is written,
   "Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him." As
   you love God, He will certainly deliver you from all the powers of
   earth and Hell. It may be that your temporal trials harass you. Are you
   poor and friendless, without supplies and without prospects? None know
   the stings of poverty but those who endure them. It were foolish to
   fret yourselves for the morrow while you have enough for today. Take
   heart, you that love the Lord, and cling closer to Him when the peril
   seems nearer, for this promise goes before you, "I will deliver him."
   Yes, doubtless the dinner is ordered when the cupboard is bare, for is
   it not written, "They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the
   days of famine they shall be fed"?

   Or, perhaps, sickness, has stealthily crept over your mortal frame.
   Gradually you have been weakened in body. Why should you tremble
   because of the infirmities of your constitution, or the natural decay
   that comes with growing years, for you shall be rescued from all the
   ill-consequences of depression of spirit and of weakness of the
   flesh--"I will deliver him." It may be that bereavement has deprived
   your life of its joys. You have been losing friends, one by one.
   Already you have borne to the grave some of the nearest and dearest of
   your kindred--and others are going. Fear haunts your breast that you
   will soon be left alone. What will you do when all help has failed and
   all light faded from your dwelling? Why, will you not then have this
   promise to fall back upon?--"Because he has set his love upon Me,
   therefore will I deliver Him"? There are no straits or struggles, no
   cares or crosses, no weary loads or dreary hardships, no privation at
   present, or famine in prospect, no pains or perils of any kind out of
   which the All-Bounteous God cannot, and will not, deliver His people!
   Only believe the promise and you shall find it true! "I will deliver
   him." Do you tell me that you are hauntedby strong temptation, that you
   have been sorely beset with them of late--that your condition and
   position are full of danger and jeopardy--that, being tempted by those
   who have great influence over you, your steps have well near slipped?
   Go to your knees! Cry to your God for strength to endure and might to
   overcome, but be not dismayed with cowardly fear, for if you have set
   your love on God, there stands this record, engraved as in eternal
   brass, "I will deliver him." You shall have Grace equal to your time of
   trial! You shall break the snares of the foe! Though you are shut in
   like Samson in Gaza, and compassed about on all sides with temptations,
   you shall wake up as a giant, refreshed and, by your strength in God,
   pluck up the gates of the fortress and carry them away--post and bar
   and all--and your soul shall be free!

   Perhaps, however, you are the victim of another fear, you are afraid of
   dying. Dying is at no time child's play, and he that treats the matter
   lightly knows not what he does. But you, perhaps, are subject to
   bondage through fear of death. Its dread accompaniments, pain of body,
   gasping for breath. Its strange outlook, a vast eternity. Its near
   approach, the rolling up of the curtain that hides from mortal view the
   scenes that lie beyond--all these appall you! Oh, be not troubled in
   mind! Have you set your love on Jesus, and does your heart cling to the
   Father, God? Then on the bed of languishing you shall find gracious
   succor and grateful relief. When your heart grows faint and your flesh
   wastes away, your soul shall be strengthened and your spirit endowed
   with fresh vigor! The noisome graveyard shall be fragrant with flowers
   of Paradise and the dark sepulcher shall be lighted up with a blessed
   hope! You shall be gently led, not roughly driven, through the dark
   shades. And as with the tender notes of a requiem, sweet though solemn,
   you shall hear this glad word, "I will deliver him: I will deliver
   him." Delivered you shall be! The trial shall issue in triumph! Victim
   of death, you shall be victor over it! As in a chariot of fire, you
   shall be borne from the land of gloom to the land of joy! To your
   Father and your God you shall rise, leading your captivity captive. But
   ah, this is not a subject to stand and preach about--it is rather one
   upon which to sit and think! So sit down, you who love the Savior, and
   again, and again, and again delight yourself with this sure word of
   Covenant promise which is given to you for your portion, "Because he
   has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver Him"!

   III. GOD'S PROMISE TO HIGH KNOWLEDGE.

   It is set forth in the latter part of our text, "Because He has known
   My name, I will set him on high." This expresses a sacred mystery, "He
   has known My name." The Hebrews of old were not accustomed to use the
   name of Jehovah, either in ordinary speech or in their writing. In
   their sacred books they were commonly in the habit of putting in the
   word, "Adonai," or, "Lord," instead of the word, "Jehovah," the name of
   their God. To many of the heathen nations the distinctive name of the
   one God was not even known! They only heard it alluded to by the
   peculiar people who delighted to keep the name to themselves. Now there
   is always a secret about that vital religion which comes to the
   Believer not in word, only, but also in power, and in the Holy
   Spirit--a secret which the natural man cannot discern. "The secret of
   the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will show them His
   Covenant." The particular form of expression used in the text arises
   from the fact that there were some in Israel who did not know the name
   of God, while others did not know Him as the "I AM"--by that
   superlative name which is His memorial unto all generations. See Exodus
   3:13-15. And just so, there are today people taught of God, who know
   the Lord, while the rest of mankind know Him not.

   Let us try to give this matter a practical bearing.

   "He has known My name." This means information. Have you, O my Soul, a
   part in that high privilege of which our Great Intercessor spoke when
   He said to His Father, "This is life eternal, that they might know You,
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent"? Ask yourself,
   my Hearer, the question. Are you initiated into the mystery of that
   fellowship with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, which they enjoy
   who walk in the Light of God? Do you know the living God? Do you know
   that He is, and there is none beside Him? Do you know that He is
   almighty and, therefore, do you bow down before Him? Have you seen that
   He is merciful and, therefore, put your trust in Him? Have you
   understood that He is just and, therefore, do you fear Him? Have your
   eyes ever perceived the blended attributes that make up the crown of
   Deity and compel you to worship Him in the beauty of holiness? Can you
   discern how impartial He is in punishing sin and yet how gracious in
   providing a Ransom for sinners? As for the ungodly world, it concerns
   them not whether there is a God or not! And as to the excellence of His
   Character, they do not regard it. But those whom He loves and whom He
   will set on high, delight to know the name of God and to spell out its
   mystic letters as they are painted on His works, unfolded in His ways
   and revealed in His Word! They make it their study to know what can be
   known of Him. God is the one Object of their life's pursuit. Oh, that I
   knew where I might find Him, is their instinctive cry! And the Holy
   Spirit is pleased to help them in their searches. Opinions,
   conjectures, guesses at the Truths of God count for nothing. Do you
   know for sure the name of the Lord, so that without hesitation you can
   say, "I know whom I have believed"? "He has known My name." That means
   trust He has relied upon it. He has come and depended upon the name of
   God as his dwelling place, the home of his soul. Wherein is your
   reliance, O Man, O Woman? On what do you depend for time or eternity?
   Is it on your own strength, your works, or your merits? Is it on your
   wit, your wealth, your rank? Ah, then these poor props will fail you
   before long. But happy is that man who knows the name of God as his
   confidence, his refuge, his high tower, his place of defense and
   security!

   To know God's name, likewise implies experience. I think many of you
   could rise and say, "Glory be to God, I do know Him by the distresses
   in which I have called upon Him, and the deliverances He has sent me!
   In my hours of darkness I have found Him to be a never-failing light. I
   have gone to His Mercy Seat in times of need, and then He has appeared
   to me. I have enquired at His holy oracle, and He has answered me with
   the Words of His mouth." Little can anyone know of God who has but
   heard of Him with the hearing of the ears. Nothing is known of God till
   we know Him by experience--nothing that is of value. All that the ear
   learns of God from another's teaching is shallow and superficial. Your
   heart must know God by its own deep communing. Let me ask you, dear
   Hearer, how far you have gone in this school of instruction and
   discipline? We shall ascertain who you are and where you are by the
   answer you are able to give to this question. Tens of thousands of men
   walk through this world and never meet with God--they do not seek Him
   in their troubles. They may invoke His name, and cry out, "God help
   me!" in a stress of grief or a surge of pain, but they forget Him when
   their trials are over.

   Oh, how different the children of God! "They that know Your name will
   put their trust in You." Theirs is not occasional, but habitual drawing
   near unto God! A good minister, sitting one day in the house of one of
   his people, overheard a dialog with a beggar woman who knocked at the
   door. The good housewife opened it and said to the poor creature, "Do
   not trouble me, now. I do not intend to give you anything today." The
   reply was, "Please don't say so, Ma'am. I am no upstart. You know me
   very well. I am an old beggar at your door. I think I have begged of
   you every week for the last seven years. Do not turn me away, kind
   lady, I pray you." She was about to be sent off without any relief,
   when the minister said, "Give her something for my sake. She is the
   exact picture of me. Her plea with you is just what I am obliged to
   plead with my God whenever I go to Him. 'Lord, give me Your mercy. I am
   no new comer--I am an old beggar. I have been dependent upon Your
   bounty, a pensioner upon Your charity these many, many years. Oh, cast
   me not away!" The Christian's life is a life of dependence upon God. He
   always has to go to Him. There is never an hour in which he could do
   without his God. Now this is the man off whom the text speaks, "He has
   known My name"-- by long experience--he has come to rely upon My
   goodness and My love."

   Then, Beloved, you will observe the promise that is given to such, "I
   will set him on high because he has known My name." "If He knows My
   name, I taught it to him--My Grace made him know it. And now, having
   given him so much Grace, I will give him more, and I will give him
   glory at the last--I will set him on high." What does it mean, to be
   set on high by God? It certainly implies rank The Christian is a man of
   rank. How so? Because every man whom God sets on high, He acknowledges
   as His child, makes him to be, "an heir of God, and a joint-heir with
   Jesus Christ." There is much respect shown in the world to the young
   man or the young woman whose good fortune it is to be heir of a noble
   title and large estates. But what must it be to be "an heir of God," to
   be "a joint-heir with Christ Jesus"? To be the son of a prince or the
   son of a king is no small thing in the esteem of most men. To have the
   blue blood in one's veins is thought to be honorable. To trace your
   pedigree up to an emperor is a matter for pride. But the child of God,
   mean as he may be reckoned on this base earth, though he should have
   lived and died in an attic or a cellar, near the wind or near the damp
   soil, is a prince of the blood imperial! He is of the royal family of
   Heaven! He shall be a peer! He shall be, before long, in the court of
   the Most High! The blood royal runs within his veins, only it is not
   the royalty of a day, nor does it belong to the crown that is so
   readily taken from the wearer's brow. The "crown that fades not away"
   belongs to every man who has set his love upon God and who knows God's
   name! He is set on high, for God has made him of a princely rank.

   The promise to "set him on high" will further mean a place of security.
   The Christian, when his faith is as it should be, is set so high above
   his enemies that they cannot reach him. We have sometimes been on the
   top of the Alps and seen a storm below in the valley. All has been calm
   over our heads in the sunlight, while below there has been all the
   tumult of the storm. God sets His servants on high, and often so high
   that when others think they will surely disturb their peace and break
   their comfort, they have been smiling and rejoicing in the clear
   atmosphere of Heaven, undismayed by the tumult that has raged beneath
   them! "The Lord is my Shepherd" they say, "I shall not want. He
   prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies." It must have
   been a glorious thing for those Frenchmen who went up in one of those
   balloons that ascended from the besieged city of Paris, to look down on
   the Prussian soldiers, vainly trying to reach them with their bullets,
   but they were up too high! It must give one a sense of security to
   think of the bullets coning half-way up, and then falling short. But
   such is the position of the Christian by faith. He is on a rock so high
   that all the gunshots of his enemies cannot reach him! He is perfectly
   safe while he is near his God. "I will set him on high"--out of harm's
   reach--"because he knows My name." It is rank and it is safety.

   To be set on high, again, means happiness. He is the highest man, in
   some respects, that is the happiest man, for he wears contentment
   within his bosom. To bear within the soul a pure satisfaction with the
   Divine will has more to make him wealthy than all the coffers of
   Croesus! And such is the Christian. Commend me to the man whose sin is
   forgiven, to whom a perfect righteousness is imputed, who is adopted
   into the Divine family, from whose past all the blackness is blotted
   out, whose present is full of contentment and whose future is radiant
   with glory--commend me, I say, to such a man whom nothing can separate
   from the love of Christ--a man to whom all things belong, whether
   things present or things to come, a man to whom Christ, Himself,
   belongs, and all the treasures of God--and say if such a man is not
   blessed to all the intents of bliss, where are the blessed ones to be
   found? If he is not ranked among the happy, and set aloft above all
   others, where can happiness even be dreamed of? Verily the true
   Christian has a portion of happiness allotted to him here below which
   far excels all the voluptuous pleasures and intoxicating joys of sense!
   He has a right to be cheerful, a duty to rejoice evermore! The
   worldling boasts that he is happier than you are--it is a vain boast,
   an empty vaunt. His mirth--what does it consists of but quips, cranks,
   and wanton wiles? His joys but flash and crack and sparkle--like thorns
   that burn for a few minutes, and then turn to ashes. Their fun will
   never compare with your happiness! They may have more laughter, but you
   have more liveliness. They dissipate their spirits, while you renovate
   your strength! Gloom follows their glee, but your calm eventides
   forestall bright tomorrows, and your present serenity is the sure
   presage of a welcome eternity! Then "hold that fast which you have,
   that no man take your crown."

   "Because he has known My name, I will set him on high." Yes, Beloved,
   He has raised us up and made us sit together in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus. Before long, so short the time with some of us, that it
   may seem like tomorrow, we shall have our place among the angels. Among
   the angels, did I say? Nearer the Throne of God than they! Where even
   Gabriel cannot sit--at God's right hand, by His side who wears our
   manhood on the Throne of God! There will He set us on high, where sits
   the Crucified, His hands still bearing the scars, and His feet the nail
   prints--He will set us there! Do not our hearts leap at the very
   thought? Worthy to be cast into the lowest pit of Hell, and yet
   Infinite Mercy promised us a seat of honor in Heaven! During the last
   week two, three venerable Brothers and Sisters, ornaments of our
   denomination, have passed away--some with whom it has been my habit to
   take sweet counsel. There was one dear Brother, who, last week, was
   hale and strong--a man who, though his hands were busy and his mind
   occupied with the cares of this life, delighted to preach the Gospel
   and was the pastor of a Church. When I heard of his departure, I seemed
   to realize more vividly how close we are to the world to come. Very
   soon, my Brothers and Sisters, you will hear of some in this
   congregation that have passed the flood. We have dear names in our
   recollection, the names of those dear to this congregation, whose
   spirits I could imagine are with us whenever we gather at the Communion
   Table. I can, without any immoderate stretch of fancy, picture them
   often within these aisles. So much did they seem to be part and parcel
   of ourselves, that when I miss them from their known place, I marvel
   that they shall occupy it no longer. And before long some of you also
   will be missing--the pastor, perhaps? Or the deacons, or the Elders, or
   some of you whose old familiar faces greet us constantly. At length you
   are gone! But oh, what a blessing if gone to swell the number of the
   glorified, to complete the orchestra of Heaven, to add some fresh notes
   to the everlasting music! The army there has gaps in its ranks-- they,
   without us, cannot be perfect. We shall soon go over to the majority.
   We shall soon go from the militant to the triumphant, from those that
   sit down here and weep over their imperfections, to those who sit up
   there, see their Lord and rejoice that they are like He! Let us
   anticipate the reunion, there, and celebrate the communion, here, full
   of the joys of hope and the visions of that better land towards which
   we journey as pilgrims! "Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore
   will I deliver him"--there is your promise for this life! "I will set
   him on high because he has known My name"--there is your promise of the
   life to come!

   I wish, oh, how I wish, this promise belonged to all of you! Alas, that
   some of you do not know His name! Neither do you set your love upon
   Him. You must go away without this blessing! Do seek it. Do ask
   forgiveness at the Savior's feet.

   God is willing to hear prayer, and when He compels you to pray, He will
   surely give the answer. "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you
   shall be saved."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 42:1-6.

   Verse 1. BeholddMy Servant, whom I uphold; My Elect, in whom My soul
   delights: Ihaveput My Spirit upon Him: He shall bring forth judgment to
   the Gentiles. Verily this prophecy is concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Observe the title which He takes. He is called the Servant of God. The
   Father calls Him, His Servant. Above all others is Christ the Servant
   of the Highest deigning to become the Servant of servants, though He is
   the King of kings. "Whom I uphold"-- which may be read two ways.
   According to some renderings, it should be, "Whom I lean upon"--as if
   God leaned the full weight of His Glory upon Christ and gave over the
   work of Grace into His hands--that is, if the passage is read
   passively. If actively, it runs as in our text, "Whom I uphold." And
   both are true. God leans upon Christ. Christ draws His strength from
   God. They co-work, and mutual is the Glory."My Elect." That is first.
   "My choice One," for there is none so choice as Christ. "My elected
   One," for Christ is the Head of election. We are chosen in Him from
   before the foundation of the world so that God specially calls Him, "My
   Elect." "In whom My soul delights." The delight of the Father in the
   Son is Infinite. He delighted in His Person. Now He delights in the
   work which He has accomplished. The delight of the Father is in Christ,
   and He delights in us because we are in Him. If, indeed, we are members
   of Christ, He is well pleased with us for Christ's sake. "In whom My
   soul delights." "I have put My Spirit upon Him." That was publicly done
   when He was baptized in the Jordan. The Spirit without measure rests
   and abides on Him, our Covenant Head. "He shall bring forth judgment to
   the Gentiles." Rejoice, then, you Gentiles! You are no longer excluded.
   At first the Word of God came to the Jews, only, but He has given the
   Man, Christ Jesus, who has brought forth judgment to the Gentiles.

   2-3. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in
   the street A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax
   shall He not quench: He shall bring forth judgment unto truth. Jesus
   was gentle, retiring, meek, quiet. His testimony was a very powerful
   one, but not a noisy one. He sought no honor among men. He frequently
   forbade the healed ones to tell of His miracles. He rather retire than
   came into public notice. He was not contentious. He did not seek to put
   out the Pharisees, who were like smoking flax. He was never hard
   towards the tender ones, but always gentle as a nurse among her
   children. Now it is very often found that where there is quietness and
   meekness, there is, nevertheless, great firmness of purpose. Noise and
   weakness go together, but quietness and strength are frequently
   combined. So read the next verse.

   4. He shall not fail.He shall not faint. So it may be.

   4. Nor be discouraged till He has set judgment in the earth: and the
   isles shall wait for His Law. This quiet, gentle Christ goes on pushing
   on His empire and extending His dominion till these far-off islands of
   the sea already know His power! And the day comes when the whole round
   earth shall be obedient to His sway! O blessed Christ, how glad we are
   to think that when we are discouraged, You are not, and when we fail
   and faint, You do not. You hold on forever, like the sun who comes
   forth from his chamber in the morning and stops not till he has run his
   race.

   5, 6. Thus says God the LORD, He that created the heavens and stretched
   them out; He that spread forth the earth, and that which comes out of
   it, He that gives breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them
   that walk therein: I the LORD have called You in righteousness, and
   will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You for a Covenant of
   the people, for a Light of the Gentiles. Thus the great God commissions
   Christ! Thus He declares that the eternal power and Godhead will back
   Him up till the Gentiles shall perceive His Light, and the people shall
   be brought into Covenant with God.

Fruitless Faith

   (No. 3434)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 21, 1861.

   "Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone." James 2:17.

   WHATEVER the statement of James may be, it could never have been his
   intention to contradict the Gospel! It could never be possible that the
   Holy Spirit would say one thing, in one place, and another in another.
   Statements of Paul and of James must be reconciled, and if they were
   not, I would sooner be prepared to throw overboard the statement of
   James than that of Paul. Luther did so, I think, most unjustifiably. If
   you ask me, then, how I dare to say I would sooner do so, my reply is,
   I said I would sooner throw overboard James than Paul for this reason,
   because, at any rate, we must keep to the Master, Himself, the Lord
   Jesus Christ. We ought never to raise any questions about differences
   of Inspiration, since they are all equally Inspired, but if such
   questions could be raised and were allowable, it were wisdom to stick
   fastest to those who cling closest to Christ. Now the last words of the
   Lord Jesus, before He was taken up, were these, "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature," and what was this
   Gospel? "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." To that,
   then, we must always cling, and Jesus Christ has given a promise of
   salvation to the baptized Believer, for He has said, "As Moses lifted
   up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
   up, and whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting
   life."

   Here it is clear He promises everlasting life to all who believe in
   Him, to all who trust in Him. Now from the Master's words we will not
   stir, but close to His own declaration we will stand. Be assured that
   the Gospel of your salvation as a Believer, with a simple confidence in
   Jesus Christ, whom God raised from the dead, will save your soul--a
   simple and undiluted reliance upon the life, death, resurrection, merit
   and Person of Jesus Christ, will ensure to you everlasting life. Let
   nothing move you from this confidence--it has great recompense of
   reward! Heaven and earth may pass away, but from this grand fundamental
   Truth of God not one jot or tittle shall ever be moved! "He that
   believes in Him is not condemned, but he that believes not is condemned
   already, because he has not believed on the Son of God."

   The fact is, James and Paul are perfectly reconcilable--they are just
   viewing a Truth of God from different standpoints. Whatever James may
   mean, I am quite confident about what Paul means, and confident about
   the truth of the two.

   A second remark. James never intended, for a moment, nor do any of his
   words lead us into such a belief, that there can be any merit whatever
   in any good works of ours. After we have done all, if we could do all,
   we would only have done what we were bound to do! Surely there is no
   merit in a man's paying what he owes--no great merit in a servant who
   has his wages for doing what he is paid to do. The question of merit
   between the creature and his Creator is not to be raised--He has a
   right to us. He has the right of creation, the right of preservation,
   the right of Infinite Sovereignty and, whatever He should exact of us,
   we should require nothing from Him in return! And, having sinned as we
   all have, for us to talk of salvation by merit--by our own works--is
   worse than vanity! It is an impertinence which God will never endure--

   "Talk they of morals, O You bleeding Lamb! The best morality is love of
   You."

   Talk of salvation by works and Cowper's reply seems apt--

   "Perish the virtue, as it ought, abhorred, And the fool with it, who
   insults his Lord."

   What James does mean, however, is this, no doubt, in brief and
   short--that while faith saves, it is faith of a certain kind. No man is
   saved by persuading himself that he is saved! Nobody is saved by
   believing Jesus Christ died for him. That may be, or may not be true in
   the sense in which he understands it. In a certain sense Christ died
   for all men, but since it is evident that many men are lost, Christ's
   dying for all men is not at all a ground upon which any man may hope to
   be saved. Christ died for somemen, in another sense, in a peculiar and
   special sense. No man has a right to believe that Christ peculiarly and
   specially died for him until he has an evidence of it in casting
   himself upon Christ, trusting in Jesus and bringing forth suitable
   works to evince the reality of his faith. The faith that saves is not a
   historical faith, not a faith that simply believes a creed and certain
   facts--I have no doubt devils are very orthodox--I do not know which
   church they belong to, though there are some in all churches! There was
   one in Christ's Church when He was on earth, for He said one was filled
   with devils--and there are some in all churches. Devils believe all the
   facts of Revelation. I do not believe they have a doubt--they have
   suffered too much from the hand of God to doubt His existence! They
   have felt too much the terror of His wrath to doubt the righteousness
   of His government! They are stern believers, but they are not saved--
   and such a faith, if it is in us, will not, cannot save us--but will
   remain to all intents and purposes, a dead, inoperative faith! It is a
   faith which produces works which saves us. The works do not save us.
   And a faith which does notproduce works is a faith that will only
   deceive--and cannot lead us into Heaven. Now this evening we shall
   first speak a few words upon--

   I. WHAT KIND OF WORKS ARE NECESSARY TO PROVE OUR FAITH IF IT IS A
   SAVING FAITH.

   The works which are absolutely necessary are, in brief, these--First,
   there must be fruits meet for repentance, works of repentance. It is
   wrong to tell a man he must repent before he may trust Christ, but it
   is right to tell him that, having trusted Christ, it is not possible
   for him to remain impenitent. There never was in this world such a
   thing as an impenitent Believer in Jesus Christ, and there never can
   be! Faith and repentance are born in a spiritual life togetherand they
   grow up together! The moment a man believes, he repents, and while he
   believes, he both believes and repents, and until he shall have done
   with faith, he will not have done with repenting. If you have believed,
   but have never repented of your sins, then beware of your believing! If
   you pretend, now, to be a child of God, and if you have never clothed
   yourself in dust and ashes. If you have never hated the sins which once
   you loved--if you do not now hate them and endeavor to be rid of them,
   if you do not humble yourself before God on account of them--as the
   Lord lives, you know nothing about saving faith! For faith puts a
   distance between us and sin! In a moment it leads us away from the
   distance between us and Christ--nearer to Christ, we are now far off
   from sin! But he who loves his sin, thinks little of his sin, goes into
   it with levity, speaks of sin as though it were a trifle, has the faith
   of devils--but the faith of God's elect he never knew! True faith
   purges the soul, since the man now hunts after sin that he might find
   out the traitor that lurks within his nature. And though a Believer is
   not perfect, yet the drift of faith is to make him perfect--and if it
   is faith to be perfected, the Believer shall be perfected--and then he
   shall be caught up to dwell before the Throne of God! Judge yourselves,
   my Hearers! Have you brought forth the fruits of repentance? If not,
   your faith without them is dead!

   Works of secret piety are also essential to true faith. Does a man say,
   I believe that Jesus died for me, and I hope to be saved, and does he
   live in a constant neglect of private prayer? Is the Word of God never
   read? Does he never lift up his eyes in secret with, "My Father, be You
   the guide of my youth"? Has he no secret regard in his heart to the
   Lord his God and does he hold no communion with Christ, his Savior, and
   is there no fellowship with the Holy Spirit? Then how can faith dwell
   in such a man? As well say that a man is alive when he does not
   breathe, and in whom the blood does not circulate, as to say that a man
   is a Believer with living faith who does not draw near to God in
   prayer, that does not live, indeed, under the awe and fear of the Most
   High God as ever present and seeing Him in all places! Judge
   yourselves, you professors--are you neglecting prayer? Have you no
   secret spiritual life? If so, away with your notion about saving faith!
   You are not justified by such a faith as that! There is no life in it!
   It is not a faith that leads to the Lamb and brings salvation! If it
   were, it would show itself by driving you to your knees and making you
   lift up your heart to the Most High!

   Another set of works are those which I may call works of obedience.
   When a man trusts in Jesus, he accepts Jesus as his Master. He says,
   "Show me what You would have me to do." The Father shows Christ what He
   would have Him to do. He does not set up His own will and judgment, but
   He is obedient to His Father's will. I will not tonight speak of those
   who know not their Lord's will, who shall be beaten with few stripes,
   but I do fear there are some professors who are living in willful
   neglect of known Christian duties, and yet suppose themselves to be the
   partakers of saving faith.

   Now a duty may be neglected, and yet a man may be saved, but a duty
   persistently and willfully neglected may be the leak that will sink the
   ship! Or the neglect of any one of such duties for the surrender of a
   true heart to Christ does not go such-and-such a length and then stop!
   Christ will save no heart upon terms and conditions--it must be an
   unconditional surrender to His government if you would be saved by Him.
   Now, some will draw a line here, and some will draw a line there, up to
   this and say, "I will be Christ's servant." That is to say, Sir, you
   will be your own master, for that is the English of it! But the true
   heart that has really believed says, "I will make haste and delay not
   to keep Your commandments. Make straight the path before my feet, for
   Your commandments are not grievous." "I have delighted in Your
   commandments more than in fine gold." Now, sons and daughters of sin,
   professedly, what do you say about this? Have you an eye to the Master,
   as servants keep their eyes to their mistress? Do you ever ask
   yourselves what would Christ have you to do? Or do you live habitually
   in the neglect of Christ's Law and wills? Do you go to places where
   Christ would not meet you, and where you would not like to meet with
   Him? Are some of you in the habit of professing maxims and customs upon
   which you know your Lord would never set His seal? You say you believe,
   you have faith in Him? Ah, Sirs, if it is a living faith, it will be an
   obedientfaith!

   Living faith produces what I shall call separating works. When a man
   believes in Jesus, he is not what he was, nor will he consort with
   those who were once his familiars. Our Lord has said, "You are not of
   the world, even as I am not of the world." Now Christ was not an
   ascetic--He ate and drank as other men do so that they even said of Him
   that He was a gluttonous Man and a winebibber because He mingled with
   the rest of mankind. But was there ever a more unearthly life than the
   life of Christ? He seems to go through all the world a complete Man in
   all that is necessary to manliness, but His Presence is like the
   presence of a seraph among sinners! You can discover at once that He is
   not of their mold, nor of their spirit, but harmless, undefiled and
   separate from sinners. Now such will the Believer be if his faith is
   genuine. This is a sharp cut to some professors, but not a whit more
   sharp than the Scripture warrants! If we are of the world, what can we
   expect but the world's doom in the day of the appearing of our Lord
   Jesus Christ? If you find your pleasure with the world, you shall meet
   your condemnation with the world! If with the world you live, with the
   world you shall die--and with the world you shall live again
   forever--lost! Where there is no separation, there is no Grace! If we
   are conformed to this world, how dare we talk about Grace being in our
   souls! And if there is no distinguishing difference between us and
   worldlings, what vanity it is, what trifling, what hypocrisy, what a
   delusion for us to come to the Lord's Table talking about being the
   Lord's sons when we are none of His! Faith without the works which
   denote the difference between a Believer and a worldling is a dead,
   unsaving faith!

   Now I have not said that any Believer is perfect. I have never thought
   so, but I have said that if a Believer could be a Believer altogether,
   and faith could have her perfect work, he would be perfect, and that in
   proportion as he is truly a Believer, in that proportion he will bring
   forth fruit that shall magnify God and prove the sincerity of his
   faith.

   One other set of works will be necessary to prove the vitality of his
   faith, namely, works of love. He that loves Christ feels that the love
   of Christ compels him--he endeavors to spread abroad the knowledge of
   Christ! He longs to win jewels for Christ's crown. He endeavors to
   extend the boundaries of Christ's and Messiah's Kingdom--and I will not
   give a farthing for the loftiest profession coupled with the most
   flowing words that never shows itself in direct deeds of Christian
   service. If you love Christ, you cannot help serving Him! If you
   believe in Him, there is such potency in what you believe, such power
   in the Grace which comes with believing, that you must serve Christ!
   And if you serve Him not, you are not His!

   This proof, before we leave it, might be illustrated in various ways.
   We will just give one. A tree has been planted Now the source of life
   to that tree is at the root, whether it has apples on it or not. The
   apples would not give it life, but the whole of the life of the tree
   will come from its root. But if that tree stands in the orchard, and
   when the springtime comes there are no buds, and when the summer comes
   there are no leaves and no fruit. And the next year, and the next, it
   stands there without bud or blossom, or leaf or fruit, you would say it
   is dead--and you are correct--it is dead. It is not that the leaves
   could have made it live, but that the absence of the leaves is a proof
   that it is dead! So, too, is it with the professor. If he has life,
   that life must give fruits. If not fruits, works. If his faith has a
   root, but if there are no works, then depend upon it, the inference
   that he is spiritually dead is certainly a correct one! When the
   telegraph cable flashed no message across to America. When they tried
   to telegraph again and again, but the only result following was "dead
   earth"--they felt persuaded that there was a fracture, and well they
   might! And when there is nothing produced in the life by the supposed
   Divine Grace which we have, and nothing is telegraphed to the world
   but, "dead earth," we may rest assured that the link of connection
   between the soul and Christ does not exist!

   I need not enlarge. We should just put it into that one
   sentence--"Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Bring forth,
   therefore, works meet for repentance! And now we turn to the second
   point with more brevity--

   II. SOME FACTS THAT BACK UP THE DOCTRINE THAT "FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS
   DEAD."

   These facts show that it is evident to all observers that many
   professors of faith without works are not saved. It would be very
   ludicrous, if it were not very miserable, to think of some who wrap
   themselves in the conceit that they are saved about whose salvation
   nobody but themselves can have any question. I remember a professor who
   used to talk of being justified by faith who was most assured about it
   when he had consumed much beer. Such professors are not at all
   uncommon, sad to say! They seem at the moment, when their condemnation
   seems written on their very brow to all who know them, to be most
   confident that they, themselves, are saved! Now, Brothers and Sisters,
   if such cases are convincing and you entertain no doubt but decide in
   their case, apply the same rule to yourselves, for although you may not
   plunge into the grosser vices, yet if you make your homes wretched by
   your selfishness, if you fall into constant habits of vicious temper,
   if you never strive against these sins, and the Grace of God never
   leads you out of them--if you can live in private sin and yet pacify
   your conscience and remain just as you were before your pretended
   conversion--when you sit in judgment and pronounce the verdict on
   others, feel that you pronounce it upon yourself, for surely for one
   sin that is openly indulged in, which is manifested to you in the
   dissipation of your fellow creatures, it is not hard for you to believe
   that any other sin, if it is constantly indulged and is loved, will do
   the same to you as it does to him! You know men who have not faith, but
   have a sort of faith, are not saved. It must be true, or else where
   were the Savior's words, "Straight is the gate and narrow the way, and
   few there are that find it"? For this is no straight gate and no narrow
   way, merely to be orthodox and hold a creed and say, "I believe Jesus
   died for me." No, it is a very narrow gate so to believe as to become
   practically Christ's servants, so to trust as to give up that which
   Christ hates! Truths which Jesus bids us believe are all Truths which
   if believed, must have an effect upon the daily life.

   A man cannot really believe that Jesus Christ has taken away his sin by
   such sufferings as those of the Cross, and yet trifle with sin! A man
   is a liar who says, "I believe that yonder bleeding Savior suffered on
   account of my sins," and yet holds good fellowship with the very sins
   that put Christ to death! Oh, Sirs, a faith in the bleeding Savior is a
   faith that craves for vengeance upon every form of sin! The Christian
   religion makes us believe that we are the sons of God when we trust in
   Christ. Will a man believe that he is really the son of God, and then
   daily and willfully go and live like a child of the devil? Do you
   expect to see members of the royal court playing with beggars in the
   street? When a man believes himself to possess a certain station of
   life, that belief leads him to a certain carriage and conversation--and
   when I am led to believe I am elected of God, that I am redeemed by
   blood, that Heaven is secured to me by the Covenant of Grace, that I am
   God's priest, made a king in Christ Jesus, I cannot, if I believe,
   unless I am more monstrous than human nature, itself, seems capable of
   being--go back to live after just the same fashion, to run in the same
   course as others and live as the sons of Belial live! We constantly see
   in Scripture, and all the saints affirm it, that faith is linked with
   Divine Grace--and that where faith is, the Grace of God is--but how can
   there be the gift of God reigning in the soul and yet a love of sin and
   a neglect of holiness? I cannot understand Grace reigning and vice
   ruling over the living and incorruptible Seed which abides forever in
   the inner man--and for this man to give himself up to be a slave of
   Satan is a thing impossible!

   Faith, again, is always in connection with regeneration. Now
   regeneration is making of the old thing new. It is infusing a new
   nature into a man. The new birth is not a mere reformation, but an
   entire renovation and revolution! It is making the man a new creation
   in Christ Jesus. But a new creature, if he has no repentance, if he has
   no good works, no private prayer, no charity, no holiness of any
   kind--regeneration will be a football for scorn! The new birth would be
   a thing to be ridiculed if it did not really produce a hatred of sin
   and a love of holiness. That kind of new birth which is dispensed by
   the Church of Rome, and also by some in the Church of England, is a
   kind of new birth which ought to excite the derision of all mankind,
   for children are said to be born-again--certified to be born-again,
   made members of Christ and children of God--and afterwards they grow
   up, in many cases--in most cases--let me say, to forget their baptismal
   vows and live in sin as others do! Evidently it has had no effect upon
   them! But regeneration such as we read of in the Bible changes the
   nature of man, makes him hate the things he loved, and love the things
   he hated! This is regeneration! This is regeneration which is worth the
   seeking! It always comes with faith, and consequently good works must
   come with faith, too. But we pass on to the last matter, which is
   this--

   III. WHAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE FAITH, BUT WHO HAVE NO GOOD WORKS?

   Then what about them? Why, this about them--that their supposed faith
   generally makes them very careless and indifferent, and ultimately
   hardened and depraved men! I dread beyond measure that any one of us
   should have a name to live when we are dead, for an ordinary sinner who
   makes no profession may be converted, but it is extremely rare that a
   sinner who makes a profession of being what he is not is ever
   converted! It is a miserable thing to find a person discovering that
   his profession has been a lie. A man sits down and he says, "Why, I
   believe," and as he walks he is careful, because he is afraid of what
   others might say. By-and-by, he begins to indulge a little. He says,
   "This is not of works. I may do this and yet get forgiveness." Then he
   goes a little further away. I do not say that, perhaps, at first he
   goes to the theater, but he goes next door to it. He does not get
   drunk, but he likes jovial company. A little further and he gets
   confirmed in the belief that he is a saved one, and he gets so much
   confirmed in that idea that he thinks he can do just as he likes!
   Having sported on the brink without falling over, he thinks he will try
   again--and he goes a little further and further until I may venture to
   say, if Satan needs raw material of which to make the worst of men, he
   generally takes those who profess to be the best! And I have questioned
   whether such a valuable servant of Satan as Judas was, could ever have
   been made of any other material than an apostate Apostle. If he had not
   lived near to Christ, he never could have become such a traitor as he
   was! You must have a good knowledge of religion to be a thorough-faced
   hypocrite! And you must become high in Christ's Church before you can
   become fit tools for Satan's worst works. Oh, but why do men do this?
   Oh, what is the use of maintaining such a faith? I think if we do not
   care to get the vitality of religion, I would never burden myself with
   the husks of it, for such people get the chainsof godliness without
   getting the comfortsof godliness. They dare not do this, they dare not
   do that--if they do, they feel hampered. Why don't they give up
   professing--they would at least be free! They would have the sin
   without the millstone about their neck! Surely there can be no excuse
   for men who mean to perish coming to cover themselves with a mask of
   godliness! Why cannot they perish as they are? Why add sin to sin by
   insulting the Church through the Cross of Christ?

   When men make a profession of religion, and yet their works do not
   follow their faith, what about them? Why, this about them. They have
   dishonored the Church and, of all others, these are the people who make
   the world point to the Church and say, "Where is your religion? That is
   your religion, is it?" So it is when they find a man who professes to
   be in Christ and yet walks not as Christ walked. These give the Church
   her wounds! She receives them in the house of her friends! These make
   the true ministers of God go to their closets with broken hearts,
   crying out, "Oh, Lord, why have You sent us to this people to speak and
   minister among them, that they should play the hypocrite before You?"
   These are they who prevent the coming in of others, for others take
   knowledge of them, as they think religion is hypocrisy, and they are
   hindered. And, if not seriously, they get, at any rate, comfort in
   their sin from the iniquity of these professors! What their judgment
   will be when Christ appears, it is not for my tongue to say. In that
   day when, with tongue of fire, Christ shall search every heart and call
   on all men to receive their judgment, what must be the lot of the
   base-born professor who prostituted his profession to his own honor and
   gain? He sought not the glory of God. What shall be the thunder bolt
   that shall pursue his guilty soul in its timorous flight to Hell? And
   what the chains that are reserved in blackness and darkness forever for
   those who are wells without water and clouds without rain? I cannot
   tell, and may God grant that you may never know! Oh, may we all tonight
   go to Christ Jesus humbly and freely, confessing our sins and take
   Christ to be our complete Savior in very deed and truth! Then shall we
   be saved! And then, being saved, we shall seek to serve Christ with
   heart, and soul, and strength!

   Lest I have missed my mark, this one illustration shall suffice and I
   have done. There is a vessel drifting. She will soon be on the shore,
   but a pilot has come on board. He is standing on the deck and he says
   to the captain and crew, "I promise and undertake that if you will
   solely and alone trust me, I will save your vessel. Do you promise it?
   Do you believe in me?" They believe in him. They say they believe the
   pilot can save the vessel and they trust the vessel implicitly to his
   care. Now listen to him. "Now," he says, "you at that helm there!" He
   does not stir. "At the helm there! Can't you hear?" He does not stir!
   He does not stir! "Well but, Jack, haven't you confidence in the
   pilot?" "Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I have faith in him," he says, "he will save
   the vessel if I have faith in him." "Don't you hear the pilot, as he
   says, "have faith in me and you won't touch the helm?" "Now, you aloft
   there! Reef that sail." He does not stir, but lets the wind still blow
   into the sail and drift the vessel on to the coast "Now then, some of
   you, look alive and reef that sail!" But they do not stir! "Why,
   Captain, what shall I do? These fellows won't stir or move a peg."
   "Oh," says the captain; "I have every confidence in you, Pilot. I
   believe you will save the vessel." "Then why don't you attend to the
   tiller, and all that?" "Oh, no," says he, "I have great confidence in
   you. I don't mean to do anything." Now when that ship goes down amid
   the boiling surges, and each man sinks to his doom, I will ask you--had
   they faith in the pilot? Hadn't they a mimicking, mocking sort of
   faith, and only that? For if they had been really anxious to have the
   vessel rescued and have trusted in the pilot, it would be the pilot who
   had saved them, and they could never have been saved without him. They
   would have proved their faith by their works! Their faith would have
   been made perfect, and the vessel would have been secured.

   I call upon every man here to do what Christ bids him! I call upon you,
   first of all, to prove that you believe in Christ by being baptized!
   "He that believes in Christ and is baptized shall be saved." The first
   proof that you believe in Christ is to be given by yielding to the much
   despised ordinance of Believers' Baptism and then, having done that,
   going on to the other means of which I have spoken. Oh, I charge you by
   your soul's salvation, neglect nothing Christ commands, however trivial
   it may seem to your reason! Whatever He says to you, do it, for only by
   a childlike obedience to every bidding of Christ can you expect to have
   the promise fulfilled, "They that trust in Him shall be saved." The
   Lord bless these words, for His name's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JAMES 1:1-26.

   Verse 1. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
   twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greet-ing.James, a servant of
   God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was an Apostle and he was the
   Lord's brother, yet he mentions not these greater things, but he takes
   the lowly title, in which, no doubt, he felt the highest honor--and
   calls himself, "a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ." Happy
   is that man who serves the Lord, whose whole life is not that of an
   independent master of himself, but of one who is fully submissive to
   the Divine command! Where is the fiction of the ten lost tribes? He
   writes to the twelve tribes that were scattered abroad, and gives them
   greeting, so that this Epistle is first directed to the seed of Israel,
   and then, as in all things, to all the Church of God, seeing all the
   saints of God are the true seed of believing Abraham, the father of
   Believers.

   2. My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers trials. Do
   not sorrow over your trials, do not look upon them as misfortunes and
   calamities--they are black vessels, but they are loaded with gold! Your
   choicest mercies come to you disguised as your sharpest trials. Welcome
   them! Do not sorrow over them, but rejoice in them!

   3, 4. Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience. But
   let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire,
   wanting nothing. Endure everything. Suffer everything that God sends
   you. Bathe yourself in this rough sea till, by God's blessing, it has
   strengthened you and cleansed you, for to that end He sends it, that it
   may perfect you by discipline, educating all your spiritual faculties
   and bringing out all your powers for His Glory. Shrink not, then, seek
   not to escape by any wrong means from trial, but go through with it,
   have perfect endurance of it, that you may be perfect and whole,
   wanting nothing. "If any of you lack wisdom," and that is the point
   where you are most likely not to be perfect and entire--

   5. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all
   men, liberally and unbraids not; and it shall be given him.We are so
   apt, when we give anything, to diminish the value of it by some unkind
   remarks. But God does not so--He gives, as He bids us give, with
   simplicity. There is the gift and He will not detract from it by
   upbraiding us. Why, some will upbraid the poor while they help
   them--"How did you come to be in such a condition?" But God says not so
   to us--the gift is given in pure liberality without any upbraiding.
   Wisdom is a gift! The best wisdom is not that which we acquire by
   study, but that which is the distinct gift of God in answer to prayer!

   6. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is
   like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. Now on the
   shore, now sinking back, now driving fearlessly ahead, then sinking
   down. This is not the kind of man that prevails with God in prayer! It
   is not the kind of faith we ought to have in God--a faith that is very
   brilliant on Sunday, but very dull on the Monday--a faith that is
   triumphant after a sermon, but which seems to be defeated when we get
   into actual trouble.

   7, 8. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the
   Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. Unstable in
   everything! Till you get a single heart, till your whole soul is bound
   up in confidence in God, you cannot expect to be stable in your ways.
   "Unite my heart to fear Your name," and then I shall not be a
   double-minded man.

   9. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted. The
   lowness of his estate is an exaltation! He shall find in his troubles a
   double blessing--he shall be made greater by being so little. "But let
   the rich rejoice in that he is made low," so that what would have been
   foolish pomp and pride is taken away from him and, by the Grace of God,
   he is kept low."Because as the flower of the grass, he shall pass
   away."

   10, 11. But the rich, in that he is made low, because as the flower of
   the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a
   burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower thereof falls,
   and the grace of the fashion of it perishes, so also shall the rich man
   fade away in his ways. Oh, to be delivered from all glorying in such
   uncertain riches! Whatever God gives you, He may soon take away from
   you. If He takes it not away, He may take away your power to enjoy it!
   It is poor, slippery stuff at the very best. Rejoice that you have
   something better, something lasting!

   12. Blessed is the man who endures temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them
   that love Him. It is promised to love, but it is given to endurance! It
   is the love of God which spies out our love and rewards it, but rewards
   it partly by trying it and then ultimately by bringing forth the
   stephanos, the crown. Men ran for a crown in the Greek games, and could
   not win the crown without the running. So does God give to them that
   run, a crown, but not without the running. He gives to them, first, the
   privilege of suffering for His name's sake--and then of being rewarded
   for it.

   13. Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God
   cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts He any man. God tries men,
   but the motiveof a trial is that which differentiates it from a
   temptation. In a temptation we try a man with a view of inducing him to
   do wrong, but God tries men to better them, that they may, by finding
   out their weakness, be saved from doing wrong. He never inclines a
   heart to evil. While He does all things, and is in all things, yet not
   so that He, Himself, does evil, or can be charged therewith.

   14. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust, and
   enticed. This is the wanton harlot that deceives the heart of man--his
   own desire, grown strong and hot till it comes to be a lusting--this
   draws a man away. It baits the hook and man swallows it and is thus
   entrapped and enticed.

   15. Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it
   is finished, brings forth death. There is the history and pedigree of
   sin! God save us from having any connection with the desire to sin,
   lest from that we be led into sin and then, from sin, descend into
   death!

   16. 17. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every
   perfect gift is from above. All good from God, all evil from ourselves!

   17. And comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning. There is variableness and
   there is the shadow of turning in the sun, but in that greater Father
   of Lights there is neither parallax nor tropic--He is always the same
   and we may go to Him with unwavering confidence because He is the same.
   Oh, what a blessing to such changing creatures as we are to have an
   unchanging God! "Of His own will." If you want to know the power of
   God's will, it never goes towards evil.

   18. Of His own will He brought us forth with the word of truth, that we
   should be a kind of first fruits of His creatures. The best and noblest
   part of His Creation, the twice-begotten, the immortals that shall be
   the bodyguard of His Son, that shall stand about His bed, which is
   Solomon's, each man with his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in
   the night. What a privilege it is to be begotten of God, to be the
   "first fruits" of His creatures!

   19. Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear.
   Because it is by the Word that we are begotten-- let us be swift to
   hear it. "Slow to speak," because there is so much sin in us that the
   less we speak, the better. In the multitude of words there lacks not
   sin. Great talkativeness is seldom dissociated from great sinfulness.
   "Slow to wrath."

   20. Slow to speak, slow to wrath. For the wrath of man works not the
   righteousness of God.There is a tendency to grow angry with those who
   do not see the Truth of God, but is it not a foolish thing to be angry
   with blind men because they do not see? What if you see yourself? Who
   opened your eyes? Give God the praise for what you see, and never
   thinkthat your anger, your indignation, your hot temper can ever work
   the righteousness of God! It is contrary thereto and cannot work
   towards it.

   21-23. Therefore lay apart all flthiness and superfluity of naughtiness
   and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your
   souls. But be you doers of the word, and not hearers, only, deceiving
   your own selves. For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he
   is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass. It is a good
   thing for him to do that, to see himself as others see him. "Beholding
   his natural face," even as men in looking into the Word of God behold
   the face of their nature--they see what they are like as they look into
   the mirror.

   24-26. For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway
   forgets what manner of man he was. But who so looks into the perfect
   law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer,
   but a doer of the work, this man shall blessed in his deed. If any man
   among you seems to be religious and bridles not his tongue, but
   deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

Sanctified Sorrow

   (No. 3435)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Oyou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold, I will
   Jay your stones with fair colors, and lay your foundations with
   sapphires. And I will make your windows of agates, and your gates of
   carbuncles, and all your borders of pleasant stones." Isaiah 54:11,12.

   Who can doubt that this promise belongs to the Gentile Church, since it
   has been so richly fulfilled in her history? For many an age the light
   did not shine upon heathen lands. One spot, alone, upon all the earth
   received the genial beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Vast continents,
   thickly populated, full of life, bustle and enterprise, lay spread out
   as a moral waste, barren and neglected. But little Revelation of God
   had found its way among the teeming multitudes of the population. To
   them the dispensation of the Grace of God had not been proclaimed. The
   mystery of Christ was not as yet made known unto the sons of men. The
   Israelites had a monopoly of Covenant privileges. But now in these
   latter days, how wondrously are the tables turned! The branches of the
   wild olive have been grafted in "that the Gentiles should be fellow
   heirs and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by
   the Gospel." Thus the Lord has taken unto Himself a numerous seed once
   ignored by Israel, "which in time past were not a people, but are now
   the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
   mercy." Not after the lineage of the flesh, but according to the nobler
   lineage of faith, the same are the children of Abraham--and with
   faithful Abraham do they inherit the Covenant mercy of God. This day
   the barren woman keeps house and is the joyful mother of many children.
   The Gentile Church has her stones of sapphire--God is in the midst of
   her to make her glad!

   Not less fully persuaded am I that this promise belongs to the Jewish
   Church. Among the natural descendants of the old Hebrew Patriarch, the
   Lord has preserved to Himself a spiritual people. Glory be to His name,
   He has not cast off His people whom He did foreknow! Even at this
   present time there is a remnant according to the election of Grace. Of
   the Jewish race there is a certain number of disciples who are
   witnesses of the Truth of God, rejoicing in Christ Jesus and
   worshipping Him as their Messiah! But the day as yet is dark for
   Israel. Thick clouds encompass her. The veil is still upon the hearts
   of her children. The converts gathered from her tribes are few in
   number compared with those from different branches of the Gentiles.
   Seems it not as though her cup of sorrow were not yet drained? God has
   put the sons of Jacob for a while out of their place as a punishment
   for their great sin in rejecting Him, whom their own Inspired Prophets
   had foretold. But doubt not, Beloved, that their future is radiant with
   hope!

   The day will come, and that day may come speedily, when the glory shall
   return to Zion and the excellence unto Ju-dah. The fullness of the
   Gentiles, then, shall acknowledge the Lord when Jewish eyes shall
   behold and recognize Him, Messiah, Prince of Peace. Well may we look
   and long with eagerness for that happy era! If I rightly read the
   Scriptures, the lost tribes are to be converted, first, and gathered
   afterwards, while the people distinguished among us as Jews are to be
   restored to their own land, and then convinced by seeing the Man whom
   they pierced, enthroned with honor and majesty. Here the world's
   history reaches a majestic climax! Once with their day of fearful
   recompense came our day of grateful visitation. Yes, the Day-Spring
   from on high has visited us! What next is unrolled in the scroll of
   dispensations? If the casting away of them became the reconciling of
   the world, what shall the receiving of them again be but life from the
   dead? So let the people to whom this great promise was originally
   spoken have all the good that was stored up for them in it!

   May not, however, this rich consolation be applied to any Church that
   is passing through a time of depression? All the promises of God are
   like minted gold, of sterling value and intended for circulation. The
   general principles of thepromises of God may be appropriated by those
   to whom they are appropriate. Let any faithful Church of Jesus Christ
   be passing through severe trial of persecution and declension, if there
   is a true likeness to Christ in it, the tempest and storm will
   eventually exhaust their fury and accomplish their end and afterwards a
   time of establishing and building up shall follow. It is said of some
   persons that they cannot fight losing battles. No such fatality need
   haunt us. We ought always to stand our ground, for when we have been
   worsted in the conflict, we have always before us the prospect that we
   shall at length be conquerors because our defeats are permitted for our
   discipline without peril to our destiny! "A troop shall overcome Gad,
   but he shall overcome at the last." Where would be the honor of a
   victory which was gained without a struggle? Is not the prize more
   welcome when it has been competed for with toil and strain? Do we not
   account any kind of success the sweeter for the toil expended and the
   difficulties mastered in reaching it? Are we to expect honor without
   labor? Take heart, then, you afflicted Church, and faint not in the day
   of adversity, for God has set over against it the day of prosperity
   when you shall be built up with all the riches and treasures of His
   Grace and when your mouth shall be filled with laughter, and your
   tongue with singing! And then shall you say, "The Lord has done great
   things for us, whereof we are glad."

   If, now, my text thus stands good to the Gentile Church, and to the
   remnant of Israel, and if it may serve to cheer and encourage the
   little Christian Churches, not only in our own land, but in all the
   regions of the earth where Christ is preached, may it not in like
   manner be applied to the experience of individual Believers? And may we
   not find in it a rich draught of consolation for ourselves? Depend upon
   it, Brothers and Sisters, our period of trial and suffering will come
   to a close and it will be overruled in the gracious Providence of God
   to the promotion of our best prosperity and our highest interests! We
   may be afflicted and tossed with tempest, but for this very cause we
   shall ultimately have our foundations laid in sapphire and our stones
   with fair colors! I will endeavor to work out this one thought in
   respect to three kinds of distress which are known to raise a tempest
   in the Believer's soul.

   The first is the great life storm in which we are turned from darkness
   to light, and from the power of Satan to God. The second, the common
   life storms in which divers afflictions befall us, and manifold
   temptations try our faith. And the third is the last storm, which
   brings with it the wreck of our frail boat after all its tossing on the
   troubled sea of life, the death of the body--then no more fatigue, no
   more distress--for we shall enter the haven of rest and enjoy an
   endless peace! Now, with regard to--

   I. THE DAWN OF OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. Is it not true that well near every
   Christian is born of a storm? We are driven to Christ through stress of
   weather. We look to Him because we have nowhere else to look for
   shelter. We drift to Christ, all of us, as mariners that are hard on
   rocks with all our righteousness wrecked, and all our other hopes gone
   to the fore. That first storm with some of you may have lasted long.
   For months or years it may have threatened your destruction. You
   remember it, and you think of it, now that the tempest has spent
   itself, that the sky is clear and you have come to rest calmly in Jesus
   Christ. Do you think that you lost anything by that storm? Do you not
   know that you gained much? You lost what it was good for you to lose!
   You gained the very blessings which you were most in need of. Do I
   speak to one who is at this hour in the very midst of such a trial? He
   that sits in the heavens looks down upon you through this storm and
   says to you, "O you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted!
   Behold, I will lay your stones with fair colors." You are afflicted
   with a sense of sin, the direst and sharpest of all afflictions. The
   arrows of adversity are blunt in comparison with those of guilt!
   Afflictions, without sin to aggravate them, are as a knife without an
   edge--they do not cut deep. But when there is sin to whet the blade,
   then the knife cuts to the very bone. What are those sins which now
   wring your hearts with anguish, but the very same sins that once
   fascinated your hearts with delight? Feeling that God is angry with
   you, every incident or act of Providence seems to you a token
   ofjudgment. Terrors haunt you in every gust of wind that blows and you
   seek in vain to extricate yourself from your present forlorn condition!
   Hold on, Man, Woman, do not despair! Better to be stricken with pain
   and suffer the smart pangs of a wounded conscience, than go on with
   giddy step, frothy song and frivolous talk to enjoy the pleasures of
   sin for a season, and then find out your mistake when it is too late
   because you are swept away like the chaff from the threshing floor!
   Your afflictions, if they lead you to God, will prove the healthiest
   discipline and the happiest circumstances that ever happened to you! "O
   you afflicted one," says God, "I will lay your stones with fair
   colors," as if, in the bitterness of repentance, you did meet with the
   blessedness of remission and the brightest sunbeams shone upon you just
   when the darkest shadows crossed your path and the heaviest clouds
   loomed over your head! Fly to your God, O Sinner! Hasten to Jesus! Look
   to His atoning

   Sacrifice! For such an afflicted conscience as yours, Jesus bled, He
   came to bind up the broken in heart, and to proclaim liberty to
   captives such as you are!

   Note the next word--"O you afflicted, tossed with tempest." Does this
   describe the heaving and flurry of your agitated breast? Are you tossed
   to and fro? Once you were at ease, becalmed aground, and you thought
   yourself as safe as you were quiet. You had a hope of your own and you
   said in your heart, "I shall never be moved." But that hope of yours
   was no sure anchorage. It served you not in any place when the clouds
   began to gather and the fierce winds began to blow. Then were you
   tossed here and there. You have tried to find some stay, some anchor,
   but alas, you have sought it in vain! You are like a ship which has
   become the sport of the winds and waves and now your spirit sinks
   within you. You reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man, and you
   are at your wits' end. All your wisdom is swallowed up. You cannot lay
   hold of a promise! You cannot take comfort from any Providence! You see
   not your signs, and yet all this tossing and all this tumult, with the
   peril in which it places you, are meant for your good! So, indeed, it
   shall prove when you cry unto the Lord in your trouble and He brings
   you out of your distresses, for notice the prophecy which is spoken by
   the mouth of the Lord, and say if it should not inspire you with
   confidence, "I will lay your foundations in sapphires." When you shall
   have a foundation of God's laying, it will be, verily, a safe
   foundation and, being of sapphire, this foundation is very precious!
   There will be no more sorrow and sadness for you, then, but a sacred
   satisfaction which it were beyond the power of any circumstance to mar!
   No more shall the buffeting of rough billows and rude breakers toss you
   to and fro, but throbs of deep joy, like waves of the mighty sea, shall
   swell their ceaseless anthem in your ears! Oh, how you will bless the
   Lord, then, that He ever drove you from your refuge of lies and drew
   you to a sure foundation upon which you might build, and be built up
   for eternity! You may be just now the sport of the tempest--high winds
   may rage within your breast--stormy passions may convulse your soul!
   Well do I remember when that same tempest howled through my spirit,
   sweeping away every fond hope and every fine conceit I had cherished.
   Before that I would gladly have contented myself with the world and the
   little ambitions it held out to my view. Ah, I would, but I could not!
   God's tempest howled through my soul and as for me, I was as a tiny
   leaf in a strong breeze, or as a ball before the whirlwind! Are you
   passing through such an ordeal? Yield not to the misery and madness of
   despair--

   "Though plunged in ills, and harassed, too, with care, ' Twere treason
   to your soul did you despair! When pressed by dangers and beset by
   foes, God will His timely succor interpose!"

   When your present emergencies shall be gathered up into past
   experience, you will look back upon them as a meet preparation for your
   better destiny. Every vestige of your own righteousness must be taken
   away in order that He may "lay your stones with fair colors, and build
   up your windows with agate, and your gates with carbuncles." Are not
   both in the promise--both the agitation and the salvation? The Lord has
   promised both. Mark that word promised, how it is used by Paul. "Now He
   has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but
   also Heaven." Then observe the consequence. The removing of those
   things that are shaken makes way for another thing, namely, that those
   things which cannotbe shaken may remain! Therefore it is that we who
   feel that everything earthly is drifting from under our feet are
   favored to receive a Kingdom which cannot be moved! Ought not this to
   reconcile our hearts to trial? Will it not make us rejoice in it, if we
   have only faith to believe that it will certainly turn out for our
   good?

   The other part of the description--after being tossed with tempest--is
   this, "not comforted." Is there nothing you can do to get out of this
   strait? Is there no solace to relieve the stress of your trial? Ah,
   poor Soul! No doubt you have been looking for light and, behold, there
   was darkness! While you have been seeking after relief, your sorrows
   have been aggravated. Did you go to the world and ask sympathy of your
   neighbors or kinsfolk, the best comfort they could offer you would but
   wound your feelings! Have you tried the merriments and gaieties of sin,
   as though you would forget the arrows of the Almighty? Lo, then, how
   visions ofjudgment to come should scare you!

   Perhaps you feel you cannot be comforted on earth. Then you are in a
   fair way to get deliverance, for you shall be comforted by the God of
   Heaven! If your sore is such that no plaster of man could ever cure it,
   glory be to God, for, blessed be His name, He delights to find those
   cases which baffle all human skill! There shall be seen the power of
   His Grace, and then will He send His Word and heal you! Your extremity
   of anguish is a token for good--a token that God means to bless you! If
   your soul refuses to be comforted by man--if you are brought to a
   stand, in which you wait onlyfor God--then of you is it spoken, "I will
   lay your stones with fair colors and your foundations with sapphires."
   He will perform all things for you, and do on your behalf what you
   cannot do for yourself!

   Every Christian will, I think, join with me in confessing that the
   dealings of the Lord with us have always baffled our own understanding,
   until we have been brought to see the end of the Lord, as Job saw
   it--that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy. Our heaviest
   losses have thus enriched us with our choicest gains. The things which,
   as they happened, caused us the most terror, have fallen out to the
   furtherance of our best interests! And, in the same manner, I believe
   the more you feel the burden of sin, the majesty of the Law of God and
   the inflexible claims of Divine Justice, the sweeter, afterwards, will
   be your apprehension of guilt removed by the blood of Christ, of the
   Law fulfilled by His obedience and of Justice satisfied by His
   Suretyship. Did you sink as low as Jonah sank, when he was in the
   fish's belly, and cried by reason of his affliction unto the Lord,
   when, as he testifies, "Out of the belly of Hell cried I, and You heard
   my voice"? Then you might purge yourselves of all false confidence, as
   Jonah did, saying, "They that observe lying vanities forsake their own
   mercy." Then, too, with the voice of thanksgiving, you would pay your
   vow as Jonah did, when he said, "Salvation is of the Lord." Take heart
   now, O you afflicted ones, tossed with tempest and not comforted! Pour
   no fresh bitters into your cup by murmuring against God and repining at
   His dispensations! Rather cry mightily and pray earnestly that the God
   who has made your experience tally with the first verse of the text may
   give you to realize the fullness of that recompense which is promised
   in the next verse! And so shall your sighs be turned into songs. So
   shall you sing with David, "You who has showed me great and sore
   troubles shall quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths
   of the earth. You shall increase my greatness and comfort me on every
   side." Happy day, dear Soul, when you are delivered from this first
   storm! Yet there are--

   II. OTHER STORMS OF LIFE WHICH THE CHILDREN OF GOD HAVE TO ENCOUNTER.

   After we find Christ, we meet with many afflictions. We are "tossed
   with tempest, and not comforted." It seems to me that the Prophet has
   used a very remarkable metaphor. Suppose you have a home--a house
   rendered dear to you by a great many pleasant associations. Into this
   cheerful abode, one night, there comes a fire. You stand with tears in
   your eyes and see it all ablaze, and you watch it as it goes, story by
   story, room by room, till all your precious treasures are consumed. You
   go away and sit down, and wring your hands in agony, for all is burnt
   up--nothing remains. But with the first dawn of the morning an angel
   appears to you and says, "Come with me to the place where your home
   once was." You go and find that all the stones that made up your house
   have been turned into jewels--and all the lime and cement have been
   transmuted into bright lustrous colors, and the pavement and flagstones
   have become sapphire! You go to the door, there are jewels--carbuncles!
   You look out of the windows and instead of their being, as before,
   common sashes and sills, you find agates all sparkling! You are looking
   almost as if you had Aladdin's wonderful lamp, which transformed
   everything. Well, now, I think that is just the thought of this verse.
   Let us read it over again. "I will lay your stones with fair colors,
   and lay your foundations with sapphires. And I will make your windows
   of agate, and your gates of carbuncle, and all your borders of pleasant
   stones." "Well," you say, "that is the fact, and no fancy or dream to
   me, I have realized it. A fire kindled on me which raged in my soul
   till it reduced to ashes all the goods I prided myself in. My hopes
   were laid waste, and I was left desolate. My nights were sleepless and
   every bone in my body was full of pain--this have I proved. Then, all
   of a sudden, there has been worked in me a marvelous change! My soul
   has had such joy--such blessing--such nearness to Christ--such delight
   in His Word--such uplifting of a spiritual temple, far richer than all
   the palaces of Oriental imagination, springing up from a furnace of
   affliction as no common language would describe." Let us just turn over
   these things, one by one, as they are painted to us by the tongue of
   Inspiration.

   You are tossed and not comforted. Bear it patiently, knowing that good
   will come to you in a far better and richer shape. Observe how it
   begins with edification. "I will lay your stones in fair colors." In
   the time of trial we not only get the proof, but we get the profit of
   experience--and these results are laid in fair colors. Do you think it
   possible for me to relate to you all the salutary lessons that I have
   acquired in affliction? The truth is learnt, thus, after quite a
   different manner from anything taught in the Sunday school! You may
   afterwards renounce all the credit you ever professed in the teaching,
   which stands merely on the authority of the teacher, but when God's
   affliction brands the Truth of God into your inmost soul, then you are
   bulletproof against all heterodoxy and it is not possible that the
   Doctrine in which you have been rooted and grounded can ever forsake
   its hold upon you! It has found an entrance into your very soul--is not
   that a grand means of steadfastness? Such strong-holding cement binds
   the stones of which your spiritual temple is built,and by such personal
   experience your character becomes shaped and fashioned according to the
   Truths of the Gospel. Thus, as affliction is not sent without design,
   one benefit you are to expect from it is that a fundamental, solid
   groundwork shall be worked in you.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, you will not fail to notice that while the
   Word of the Lord is addressed to the afflicted, the hand of the Lord is
   engaged very particularly on their behalf. "I will lay your foundations
   with sapphire." Times of public calamity try our foundation and so do
   all times of private affliction. When the natural emotions are
   violently excited, all the beliefs and sentiments, all the hopes and
   aspirations to which men have clung in calmer days are put to the test.
   And if they are not well and truly based, they can easily be shifted.
   This, therefore, is one of the salutary effects of sanctified
   affliction--in the process of such discipline we get to have the
   foundation of our faith laid by a Divine hand. "I will lay your
   foundations." The Lord draws near to us and works in us after His own
   Sovereign good will, imparting to us the true faith and the ardent love
   which are consonant with the Truth of God. Then we have foundations
   hard as sapphire and as precious, as unbreakable, as Divine! We feel
   that now we have received the Truth, not in the mere abstract, but in
   its vital power, its moral influence and its spiritual beauty, as the
   foundation of our souls and as a foundation of our hope which can never
   be removed.

   What a lovely change, too, is made in our outlook! "Your windows of
   agate!" Before I was afflicted I looked through the lattices of carnal
   sense. I was well contented, though the things of this life and the
   objects near at hand bounded my view. But now I have been taught to
   look upwards and to long for the life to come and the land that is far
   off. Now my soul says, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove, that I might
   fly away and be at rest." And as I open the window towards the new
   Jerusalem, I sing--

   "Brief life is here our portion,

   Sorrow and short-lived care.

   The life that knows no ending,

   The tearless life is there."

   It is wonderful how affliction cleans the windows of the soul! I find
   the word, "windows," here might be much better translated "bulwarks,"
   or, "defenses," as if to show the manner in which we are fortified
   against temptation and enabled to resist the destructive force of those
   strange changes and perilous waves that are common to this stormy life.
   Have you learned, Beloved, to fly to the Rock for shelter? Have you
   come to hide behind the dying Savior? Do you know the tune of David's
   Psalm, "Blessed be the Lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war
   and my fingers to fight, my goodness and my fortress; my high tower and
   my deliverer, my shield, and He in whom I trust" Then your godly sorrow
   has produced some happy results! Not in vain has your spirit been
   overwhelmed within you! This is a lesson to be acquired in the school
   of adversity whereby we are brought to rest in the Lord more abidingly
   than we ever did before--and thus we prove that He has made our
   fortifications of agate.

   Still further it is said, "I will make your gates of carbuncle," as if
   to intimate more close and intimate communion with God. We come nearer
   to Christ, think more of Him, spend more time in meditation, get to
   understand more of His work and His Person, set our hearts more fully
   towards Him and the good things of His Grace after the tempest has
   spent its fury and the clear shining has followed. Surely, if
   affliction did nothing more for us, it would be a great gift! It takes
   away the doors of iron and wood, and it gives us gates of carbuncle!
   And we say--

   "Come, then, oh, you sweet affliction, Thus to bring our Savior near."
   Right sure I am that many of our tossing and buffeting have produced a
   permanent benefit which has given tone to our character and shed a
   hallowed light over our whole career! Find me a Christian whose
   conversation is full of rich savor, whose judgment is tempered with
   charity, one whose fervent zeal is blended with the meekness of wisdom,
   and I will guarantee you, as a rule, he has seen much affliction! "They
   that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters,
   these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep."
   Physicians often recommend a sea voyage to their patients. Do you think
   it is merely for the fresh air they breathe? No, I can tell you there
   is more than that in the prescription. It breaks the links that bind
   one to everyday life. There is a solitude on that broad expanse of
   waters which does not admit of the newspaper or the post office
   breaking in upon the stillness of your reflections! Your country, your
   office, your friends, your home are all at a distance. The
   communications you are known to hold with them are broken.

   And is it not so with Christ's disciples, when He compels them to get
   into a ship and leaves them a while to be tossed with waves in the
   midst of the sea? Do not they then feel a profound solitude which
   changes the hue of all their thoughts? Mind you not what he said who
   was the saddest of all the old Hebrew Prophets--Jeremiah in his
   lamentations bears this witness--"It is good for a man that he bears
   the yoke in his youth. He sits alone and keeps silence because He has
   borne it upon him." There is no room to doubt it, Friends--sorrow is
   favorable! God's brightest gems have had the most polishing on the
   lapidary's wheels. The purest, cleanest wheat is that which has had the
   most winnowing. We grow in Grace, doubtless, in our times of joy, but I
   think it is slow work. There are precious fruits put forth by the moon
   as well as precious fruits brought forth by the sun. Bright days would
   wither us if there were no shady nights to temper our gaiety. We are
   like the sycamore tree--unless we had trials, we would never come to
   spiritual perfection. Well, we have cause to be thankful if, speaking
   experimentally, we can say, "All the storms we have encountered up to
   now have been blessed to us--all our tossing and tempests have
   furthered our good speed, and all the convulsions that have shaken our
   house have thus far contributed to its being built up with stones laid
   in fair colors upon a foundation of sapphire. And now, lastly--

   III. THE SAME HAPPY ISSUE OUT OF ALL OUR AFFLICTIONS WILL HAPPEN, IN A
   GRANDER SENSE, WHEN THE LAST HURRICANE SHALL BLOW.

   Then shall this frail tabernacle totter and fall! Then eyes, and ears,
   and hands and feet shall fail us. Then back to mother Earth shall this
   feeble flesh return. I know the earthly house of my tabernacle shall be
   dissolved. I expect it. I look for it. The affliction may take the form
   of grievous disease--the tossing to and fro on my couch may be
   distracting--it may be that no medicine can relieve my pain or comfort
   me. But oh, the glory that is to follow! This very body of ours-- who
   shall tell what it shall be like? We know that it shall be transformed
   and made like unto the glorious body of Christ Jesus, our Lord! We may
   patiently endure the cross, since we shall so soon receive the crown!
   We may placidly go down to the grave, since we shall so triumphantly
   come up from it! We may cheerfully take leave of our lodgings, here,
   since we have a home in prospect where our kindred shall all be
   gathered, and our Lord never absent! Brothers and Sisters, we are, as
   it were, in a ship at sea today, tossed with tempest, but we are to be
   in a palace before long! You observe how the figure changes, never
   tossed again, never again put forth on a tempestuous sea. Like
   buildings and mansions, we shall be fixed and permanent. In that land
   of our inheritance is a mansion with its foundation of sapphire, with
   its windows of agate, with its gates of carbuncle! What a sweet
   surprise for the sons of poverty on earth! Those jewels, since jewels
   are always connected with rank or royalty, are meant to betoken the
   honors in the next world to those who are humble and faithful in their
   sacred calling here. You shall have such palaces as Oriental
   extravagance could never emulate! Does it belong to kings to dwell in
   palaces? You shall be kings and priests unto God! A few more days of
   languishing with your faint hopes and fretting fears, your throbbing
   temples and feverish pulse before Christ bids you come! The Master
   calls for you! You must obey the summons! And what next? Forever with
   the Lord!

   I think I hear you say, "Amen, so let it be." Do notice how three
   times, here, it is repeated, "I will," "I will," "I will." God has said
   it and He will do it! Believe and rejoice therein, therefore, for it is
   no fiction, but a fact! Yet a little while and you shall leave your
   cottage for a mansion, your toil shall be exchanged for rest, your
   dishonor for glory, your pain for infinite pleasure! You shall find new
   company and better in yonder world of the Light of God! Though you
   close your eyes on fair prospects, below, fairer scenes await you
   above. Be comforted! Notwithstanding any distress, the last tempest may
   occasion you, depend upon it--"to die is gain." You shall lose nothing
   that it were worth your while to keep. You shall gain all your
   "capacious powers can wish, more than your imagination can paint."
   Press forward, Beloved, and may the confidence of a joyous future make
   you bold to brave the tempest and the storm! Peace be with you!

   Alas, then, if you are not in Christ, if you are not a child of God,
   this promise melts away before your eyes! You have no part or lot in
   it. May God change your heart, renew your nature, lead you to receive
   Christ and believe in Him--then will He give you to be His sons and
   daughters and so shall your heritage be secure forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 54:1-16.

   Try and suck all the sweetness that you can out of this Chapter while
   we read it. The personal application of a promise to the heart by the
   Holy Spirit is that which is needed. The honey in Jonathan's woods
   never enlightened his eyes untilhe dipped the point of his rod into it
   and tasted it. Try and do the same. This Chapter is the woods wherein
   every branch drips with virgin honey. Sip and taste. Be satisfied.

   Verses 1-3. Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into
   singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child; for more
   are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,
   says the LORD. Enlarge the place ofyour tent, andlet them stretch forth
   the curtains ofyour habitations: spare not, lengthen your cords,
   andstreng-then your stakes; For you shall break forth on the right hand
   and on the left; and your seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the
   desolate cities to be inhabited. You see they are called upon to praise
   God before the mercy comes. "Sing, O Barren," while yet barren! Sing, O
   desolate one, while yet desolate! And you who are narrowed and confined
   for space, thank God that He is about to enlarge you! Begin, already,
   to stretch your cords and strengthen your stakes. We ought to act upon
   faith and sing upon faith. The songs which are made at the sight of
   mercy are very sweet, but the songs that are sung before the mercy
   comesare those which are most acceptable to God! We may say of the
   sonnets of faith, "Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have
   believed."

   4. Fear not; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be you confounded,
   for you shall not be put to shame: for you shall forget the shame
   ofyour youth and shall not remember the reproach ofyour widowhood any
   more. The dark past, the dreary past shall be so obliterated with
   abounding mercy that they shall forget it. Your memory of it shall not
   be painful. It shall only be as a foil behind the bright diamond of
   mighty mercy, if you remember it at all.

   5. For your Maker is your Husband---Bound to you by the dearest,
   closest and most enduring ties 5-7. The LORD ofHosts is His name;
   andyour Redeemer, the Holy One ofIsrael; The God ofthe whole earth
   shallbe called. "For the LORD has called you as a woman forsaken and
   grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth when you were refused, says your
   God. For a small moment Not, "a moment," but "for a small moment."

   7, 8. Have I forsaken you: but with great mercies will I gather you. In
   a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment: but with
   everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you; says the LORD your
   Redeemer This belongs to the whole Church of God. I know we might refer
   it all to the Church in general, but I invite you tonight to remember
   that what belongs to the Church as a body belongs to every member of
   that mystical body. Therefore, feast here. Be not afraid. Take these
   words as spoken to you--even to you--by God the Holy Spirit!

   9-10. For this is as the waters ofNoah unto Me: for as Ihave sworn that
   the waters ofNoah shouldno more go over the earth; so have Isworn that
   I wouldnot be angry with you, nor rebuke you. For the mountains shall
   depart, and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from
   you, neither shall the Covenant of My peace be removed, says the LORD
   that has mercy on you. What more can He say than to you He has said?
   What surer pledges can He give? Oh, rest, rest, rest, sweetly rest on
   this sure Word of Covenant love! Then let the mountains move. He told
   you they would. Then let the hills of your comfort sink. He told you
   they would. But even then, when the earth, itself, does reel, and the
   very pillars of the universe are snapped, He stands, still the same! "I
   have sworn that I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you."

   11. O you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I
   will lay your stones with fair colors, and lay your foundations with
   sapphires. Built with jewels.

   12. And I will make your windows of agates, and your gates of
   carbuncles and all your borders of pleasant stones. They must be rare
   sights if the windows are so rare. If the windows are of agate, what
   are the sights that are seen through them? And if the very gates and
   doors are carbuncles what must there be in the house of love within? If
   the very borders and the outside fringes of the royal domains of Heaven
   are of precious stones, what must it be to be there? Remember that the
   best thing in this world is trodden under feet in the world to come,
   for we are told that the streets are paved with gold. Men hunt after it
   here and tread on it there, for they have nothing better, there, than
   this world can possibly afford them.

   13. And all your children shall be taught ofthe LORD. It must be a
   greater privilege than windows of agates and gates of carbuncle, to see
   our children--to see all the children of God--taught by His own Spirit!

   13. And great shall be the peace ofyour children. That is the most
   precious pearl of all, with its soft radiance, precious to the soul.

   14, 15. In righteousness shall you be established: you shall be far
   from oppression; for you shall not fear: and from terror, for it shall
   not come near you. Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not
   by Me. Enemies will come, but God will not be with them.

   15, 16. Whoever shall gather together against you shall fall for your
   sake. Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the
   fire. For he cannot blow any more than God lets him. He is God's
   creature. The Maker of the weapons of war is still in the hands of God.

   16, And that brings forth an instrument for his work: and I have
   created the spoiler to destroy. When he does his worst, he is only
   doing what I meant he should do. The Divine decree of God still, with
   its mighty circle, does encompass the worst deed of man, and overrules
   it all for the good of His Church.

Christ Glorified

   (No. 3436)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 4, 1869.

   "He has glorified You." Isaiah 55:5.

   GOD has glorified His Son. How deeply we ought to regret that we
   glorify Christ so little, bought with His precious blood, owing all we
   have to Him. We make but a very poor return and even when we are helped
   by the Spirit of God to glorify Christ, yet I am sure we should always
   feel an insatiable desire to do it yet more. To glorify Christ is so
   sweet a thing that when a man has once tasted of it, he pants and pants
   within his spirit for a greater capacity to glorify Christ-- and this
   is one of his griefs, that he cannot praise his Savior as he
   would--hence it is that oftentimes the Prophet and the Psalmist, when
   they were most full of praise, would bid the earth, the sea, the
   heavens, and the Heaven of heavens, help to praise the King in whom
   they saw such ravishing beauties and delights! Hence it is that godly
   men, whenever they are stirred up and feel that they could magnify and
   bless the Lord, always want their fellow creatures to join them--and
   their sorrow is that Jesus does not reign in every heart and that He
   has not a throne in every soul!

   Now it must be a great comfort to lovers of Christ, who mourn that He
   is not honored as He should be, that God has taken care of His Son's
   honor. "He has glorified You," and you know when God glorifies, He does
   the work perfectly! He does it after His own Spirit and that an
   Infinite One, so that the Glory of Christ, after all, is safe. And
   though He is blasphemed by rebels, dishonored by apostates and grieved
   by ourselves, yet God, after all, shall not suffer Christ's fame to be
   tarnished for a single moment by all this, for He has said, "He has
   glorified You." I don't know that I can preach from the text, but I do
   know what I can do. I can feel thrice happy at the thoughts which it
   raises in my mind! It is so delightful to think that the crown is safe
   upon His head, though the nations rebel and the kings take counsel
   against Him, that his shield is forever glorified and untarnished, let
   men do what they may! Him has God the Father exalted and given Him a
   name which is above every name, which is first and chief and shall
   never be second, but shall forever reign and must reign till He has put
   all His enemies under His feet.

   Now glancing across the subject, as some skiff flies over the sea, we
   will talk about what God has done by way of glorifying His Son, Jesus--

   I. GOD HAS GLORIFIED HIM IN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF SALVATION.

   From first to last, Christ glorifies His Father, and the Father
   glorifies Him. Begin with that which has no beginning, namely,
   everlasting love, and we find that we are chosen in Christ Jesus from
   before the foundation of the world. The love of God which comes to us
   through Jesus Christ always is the channel--and it is connected with
   Jesus Christ before the heavens were stretched abroad! He was glorified
   in our election! Now with Christ Jesus in the mind of the Eternal
   Father, there is no election to eternal love except through Jesus
   Christ! And if you and I are chosen, it is--

   "Because Christ is My first elect, He said, He chose our souls in
   Christ our Head." We dare not look into that council chamber unless we
   knew that Christ was there. We dare not think of the Infinite Wisdom of
   God in the arrangement of all things from the beginning, if we did not
   remember that Christ was the center of these arrangements and that as
   many as have believed on Him were represented in Him in those days
   before the daystar knew its place, or planets ran their round. God has
   been pleased to glorify Christ afterwards in all the promises which,
   one by one, revealed the glorious Grace of God, from that first promise
   at the gates of Eden concerning the Seed of the woman, right on until
   He appeared--the hand that drew back the black curtain that hid the
   face of God was always thehand of the Crucified--and whenever men come
   to see anything of the marvelous love and goodness of God, they always
   behold it in connection with the Messiah, the Anointed One yet to come.

   God has glorified His Son in the matter of redemption. There is no
   redemption out of Christ, and there is none to help Christ in the
   matter of redemption. Albeit that Calvary seems to have a black cloud
   of shame hanging over it, yet is there no spot on earth or Heaven more
   glorious, for there it was that God permitted His Son to bear, without
   assistance, the Divine Wrath which was due to our sins, allowed Him to
   tread the winepress alone and would not permit that of the people there
   should be one with Him, lest the glory should in any way be divided.
   Christ, and Christ, alone, must pay the price of our souls with His own
   soul!

   So onward, if you come to the matter of our justification or our
   acceptance which sprang out of redemption, God glorified His Son. We
   are, if pardoned, only forgiven through His blood! If justified,
   entirely by virtue of His righteousness! If accepted, it is always in
   the Beloved! If perfected, we are completed in Him, perfect in Christ
   Jesus! There is not a single Covenant blessing--as I begin at the
   beginning so may I continue to the close--there is not a single
   blessing in the economy of Christ which comes to us apart from Christ!
   And as we receive these gifts, one by one, the Holy Spirit takes care
   to make us know this--He empties us of self that we may see the
   fullness of Christ. He kills our pride that we may see the excellence
   of Christ. He takes away our strength that we may behold the power of
   Christ. In the operations of the Holy Spirit within our soul, while
   they aim at destroying sin and at many other blessed results, yet they
   have for their first and chief purpose, the making Christ glorified in
   the heart of all His people, in every gift that comes from the hand of
   the Most High! Brothers and Sisters, our preservation, our final
   perseverance and every other blessing which is secured to us, and about
   which we have no doubt--all this comes to us in Him! We are preserved
   in Christ Jesus. Because He lives, we live, also, and only because He
   lives and by virtue of our union with Him--we who are the branches
   continue to bring forth fruit--but if we were separated from Him, we
   should be only fit to be cast into the fire to be burned! Right away
   from the gates of Hell, up to the pearly gates of Heaven, it is Christ
   Jesus who is glorified! In every step the Believer takes, right out of
   the slough of despondency, up to the Beulah hilltop of full assurance
   and still onward beyond the clouds, and beyond the stars in the palace
   of eternal glory, it will be Christ, and Christ Jesus, alone, who shall
   have all the praise! God has taken care in the planning of the whole
   economy of Christ, that Jesus Christ should have the pre-eminence.
   There is much to talk of here, but think of it--that will be better
   than my speaking. Turn it over as Abraham Booth wrote a book showing
   the Grace of God in all the ways of salvation, so somebody else might
   write a book showing the glory of Christ in every single part of the
   way. And if we cannot write such a book, yet at least we must feel
   precious emotions as we contemplate the whole. In the next place, God
   has glorified His Son--

   II. IN THE MIDST OF THE CHURCH.

   The Church is to Christ what Eve was to Adam. She was taken out of
   Christ--she is bone of His bone and flesh of His flesh. As the Apostle
   says, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
   shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh." This is a
   great mystery, but I speak concerning what? Concerning matrimony? Yes,
   in one sense, but not in another sense. Concerning Christ and His
   Church, for your cause did Christ leave His Father and He came into
   your world that He might be one flesh with His Church--she owes all to
   Him--her very existence is owing to Christ. As Eve springs from Adam,
   the Church springs out of the loins of Jesus Chris!.

   Now, Beloved, it is meet that seeing this is the case, Christ should
   have no secondplace in His Church, and certainly no such place has been
   allotted to Him by the eternal Father. As I can now but speak of the
   Church of God, at large, I think I am guided for a moment by an evil
   spirit standing at my left hand, who points with black fingers over to
   the city of the Seven Hills, and he says to me, "There is one great
   supreme ruler, the Vicar of God on earth--behold his splendors! See how
   they bear him through the streets of Rome upon the shoulders of men,
   with canopies of silk, smothered with jewels and with peacock and
   ostrich feathers! Mark how they swing their censers and how the
   multitudes fall down before him, for him has God exalted, for him has
   God glorified." Ah, but this is a vain and idle boast, for we read not
   in any page of this Book of any such exaltation to any being! And where
   will be found the being that shall dare to take it, unless he shall
   first become the victim of Satan? Satan said to Christ, "All this will
   I give You if You will fall down and worship me." And he that has it,
   must have first fallen down and worshipped Satan, or he has no such
   power among the sons of men!

   Now, Beloved, Christ did not redeem His Church with His blood that the
   Pope might come in and steal away the glory! He never came from Heaven
   to earth and poured out His very heart that He might purchase His
   people so that a poor sinner, a mere man, should be set upon high to be
   admired by all the nations and to call himself God's representative on
   earth! Christ has always been the Head of His Church. Why, we have read
   in history that kings at different times have wished to play the Head
   of the Church, and that we owe our Protestantism, as we call it over
   here--that we owe much of that to the desire of a certain crowned head
   to become a little Pope over certain dominions! This is very true, but
   not Henry the Eighth, nor his successor, nor any of those who now live,
   are more the Head of the Church than he is God, Himself! It is not
   possible for any to be Head in the Church of Christ, but Jesus! Has God
   exalted Him and made Him to be the Head over all things--and it is
   usurping the prerogative of Christ for any to suppose they can be Head
   of the Church of Christ, for Jesus Christ is the Head and He, alone,
   holds power over ecclesiastical organizations! Over the sacred
   mystical, blood-bought, redeemed, regenerated Church of Christ there
   never can, by any possibility, be any other Head but Jesus Christ, the
   Lord Himself! Now mark, God has exalted the Lord Jesus Christ in the
   government of His Church All authority, all authoritative rules in Zion
   come through Jesus Christ. All true teaching in Zion comes from His
   lips. We call no man, master, upon earth, for One is our Master, and
   that One is Christ. No man is Rabbi in the Church, but He is our
   Rabboni, our Teacher, and all other teachers are thieves and robbers if
   they teach on their own authority. They only are accepted as the Lord's
   shepherds, who speak Christ's Truth in Christ's name--and in the power
   of His own Spirit. God has made Christ to rule supremely throughout the
   Church, and in this He has glorified Him!

   He has made Him the Head of the Church in another respect--He is the
   head of all light in the Church. There is no true light in the
   Christian Church, not a single spark of it, but what comes from Christ.
   All life comes to us from Him. There may be energy in the Church of a
   carnal and fleshly sort--she may have force and power which she derives
   from men--but this will die and perish, like the grass and the flower
   of the fields. Vital godliness always proceeds from Jesus Christ, as
   the branch's life comes from the vine. "Without Me, you can do nothing,
   but because I live, you shall live, also." He is the life of men! He
   quickens whom He will and it is not possible that there should exist
   even a grain of spiritual life in any human heart, but that which comes
   to that heart through Jesus Christ! He is also the Head over all things
   in the Church--all spiritual things. The Spirit of God resides in
   Christ without measure--and He sends forth the Spirit-- He gives a
   Comforter to us. "It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness
   dwell," and the continuance of the Church, and the growth of the
   Church, and the edification of the Church--all sorts of beneficial
   influences which come to the Church--proceed to us through Jesus
   Christ, the Church's covenanted Head!

   Now I wish that we should form parts of the true Church of Christ to
   whatever denominations we may belong. Let us cling closer and closer to
   our blessed Master, for the secret of union in the Church is union with
   Christ. It is utterly hopeless, Brothers and Sisters, for us to expect,
   as the world now is, and as men now are, that we shall ever, all of us,
   agree in our opinions about all things. God never made us such
   creatures that we could agree in all things. He has so constituted us,
   and wisely so, that we, some of us, catch one angle of the Truth of
   God, and others another. To me one Doctrine, perhaps, will always stand
   out much more clearly than certain others. I wish it were not so. I
   should like to have a mind comprehensive enough to grasp all Truth--to
   attain the completed picture of the Truth of God without ever
   caricaturing a single feature. But I am deeply conscious I am far from
   being able to do that! And I think, without being censorious, I may say
   I do not know any of my fellow creatures who do! But there is in them a
   warp somewhere or other in the judgment of good men. Some mistake of
   some man which is not an offensive mistake at all. This is rather an
   infirmity than a sin, for he follows what he thinks is the Truth of
   God. His eyes are not right. He has got a little squint and he thinks
   Truth is a thing that it is not. He shoots well, mark you, if the mark
   were where he thinks it is, but it is not just there and, therefore,
   his arrow does not quite hit the center of the target. The true place
   of union will be, mark you, never in the Creed but in Him who is the
   Truth! If we believe in Him, love Him, cling to Him, follow Him,
   imitate Him, glorify Him, we shall get nearer each other than ever we
   were, closer to the common center! We must be closer to one another. "I
   would preach up nothing but Christ and preach nothing down but sin,"
   said a good old Divine, and the good man was right! Some old lady who
   heard of certain high Calvinistic preachers coming to a certain place
   did not know who they were, or what they were, but she said she thought
   she liked them because of their names. She misunderstood the words--she
   thought they were high Calvarypreachers--and anybody who preached high
   Calvary would suit her if they lifted up the Cross of Jesus, preached
   up the Master and glorified His name! If in doubt, this should be the
   test of the Doctrine--does it glorify Christ? This should be the test
   of all our opinions--do they glorify Christ? For nothing is fit to be
   within the walls of Zion but that which bows down before Zion's King!

   To change the tone, again, ringing the same peal of bells, in the third
   place-- III. GOD HAS HIGHLY EXALTED HIS DEAR SON IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
   THE CROSS.

   Oh, for a poet's mind and seraph's tongue to speak of the wonders of
   the Cross where Christ, the Savior, hung and died! He died in
   shame--this never dimmed His Glory--it reveals it to the admiring eyes
   of all the aged saints who delight to look thereon. What did Jesus, by
   His dying a painful death, do for us? Why, first, as you all know, He
   put away all His people's sins. There are some that think that Christ
   died to make all men salvable. They may keep their doctrine--it has no
   charms for me! That Christ died, some think, for all men, and it is a
   death for every man, I know the Word of God declares, but there is a
   Redemption, there is a Redemption far other than that which is
   universal. He laid down His life for His sheep. He loved His Church and
   gave Himself for it--and there is a people spoken of who are redeemed
   from among men in quite another sense in which any redemption was ever
   made for all men. Now, Beloved, as many as Christ stood for as a
   Substitute, for so many did He take their sins. And although it is
   written, "The Lord has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all," for, "He
   was made sin for us," says the Apostle, and the sin of His people was
   actually laid upon Him--imputed to Him, though it was not His--yet He
   took it for His people and here is the Glory, that all that mass of sin
   no longer exists! It is gone! He has vanquished the tyrant and "made an
   end of sin." What a wonderful word--made an end of it, and brought in
   everlasting righteousness! He has cast our iniquities into the depths
   of the sea. The blood of Christ exterminated our sins when He stood in
   the place of His people! He suffered an equivalent for all that was due
   by them and from them to God, and the debts have ceased to be, for they
   are all paid and disposed of, no charge being brought against Christ's
   elect, for, says the Apostle, "It is Christ that died; yes, rather that
   has risen again." In the morning when the Father raised His Son from
   the dead, and Jesus stood once more upon earth, no more to die--in that
   day the sentence went forth--"None shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect." Oh, what a blessed work was this to do, to take sin away
   where it never can be found again! To make it to cease to be! To cover
   it over forever! To blot it out! But this was not all--our Lord, by His
   death, destroyed death and he that has the power over it--the devil!

   But let us think--He disposed of death first of all. He slept in the
   tomb. When the morning came, the prison door was opened and He rose,
   the First-Born from the dead, the First Fruits of them that sleep and
   the harvest sheaf of all who shall come henceforth from the sepulcher!
   And so now the tomb is no more a prison, a place of ruin! The big
   imprisoning stone is rolled away. "He that lives and believes in Christ
   shall never die, and he that believes in Him, though he were dead, yet
   shall he live." Over yonder cemetery with its holy memories and long
   lamented departed, I hear a voice ringing, "Blessed are the dead that
   die in the Lord; yes, says the Spirit, for they rest from their labors,
   and their works do follow them." And in another case, Beloved, "I am
   the resurrection and the life; death is dead." Jesus Christ has
   accomplished this and the Father has glorified Him!

   And now He has also vanquished, once and for all, for His people, all
   the hosts of Hell. Satan is a cruel enemy to the Lord's people. He
   molests them, he worries whom he cannot devour. But here is our
   consolation, that he has an invincible enemy. Christ gave Satan every
   advantage. He met him, as an old Divine says, "on his own dunghill." He
   bearded the lion in his den--no, He bearded him on his own hill. "This
   is your own hour," He said--Satan's own hour, and the hour of
   darkness--but Jesus triumphed, triumphed when the whole artillery of
   Hell was discharged against Him--when all the floods out of the mouth
   of the dragon were vented forth upon Him! He vanquished all the hosts,
   and bears the banner of a glorious triumph this day, "having led
   captivity captive, and ascended up on high."

   To tell of all the wonders of the Cross of Calvary would take far
   longer than the time we can allot to it now, but we may sum it all up
   in the words of the text, "He has glorified You." The Father has put
   many crowns upon the head of Him that wore the crown of thorns!

   I wish to ask a minute's attention to the next, namely, that the Father
   has glorified Christ in His present power.The Father sustains Him in
   the highest heavens among the saints. It is no small glory that Christ
   should sit at the right hand of the Father, as He does. He was made a
   little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but now is
   crowned with Glory, honor and the loftiest created beings delight to do
   His commands! He reigns in Heaven with scepter undisputed. He says to
   this one, "Go, and he goes! To another, come, and he comes!" His
   intercession in Heaven is part of the Glory He has received. As He
   pleads there like a high priest, He pleads with authority, with a power
   that is always felt. The blood of Jesus Christ speaks to the heart of
   God, and no desire of Christ's is ungranted when heard. A case put into
   Christ's hands always speeds--if we ask the Father in Christ's name, He
   will do it for us. I am sure very few of us know this, that if we ask
   in Christ's name, we ask for Christ's sake, and that is right and good,
   and that is as far as we get. But do you know the difference? If you go
   to a man and say, "Give me such-and-such for the sake of such a friend,
   he deserves it of you," that is a good plea. But suppose that friend
   arms you with this power, and he says, "Now you may go and askfor it in
   my name--say I sent you--use my name," why, that is more powerful by
   far! And when each Christian becomes clothed, as it were, with that
   power from Christ, so that he asks God in Christ's name as though
   Christ asked, what power is there! And it is part of the Glory of
   Christ that His intercession should thus be so powerful for His people
   this day.

   And, Brothers and Sisters, think how the Father has exalted Christ in
   that at this time He is receiving every hour some of the purchase of
   His blood. I have sometimes tried to picture in my eyes the delight of
   Christ, the gleaming of His eyes of love, as His blood-bought ones come
   Home one by one. You know it is His prayer, "Father, I will that they,
   also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am." Here they come,
   one after another! Some from this Church--one yesterday--usually two or
   three a week they go up into the bosom of Christ! You know how the
   farmer rejoices as he sees the loaded wagons coming, one by one, to the
   barn--but he has sowed, not with blood, though he may have sowed with
   tears. You know how you and I rejoice as we think we have been the
   means of the conversion of someone--but what is the joy of Christ as He
   sees the perfection of His goodness? Christ is exalted, fresh crowns
   are laid at His feet--the Eternal Spirit, as He brings and conducts the
   chosen spirit up to Christ, glorifies Him! And here, below, Brothers
   and Sisters, let us add, as we leave this point, Jesus Christ is
   glorified in the power which He possesses in the conversion of souls.
   Wherever His name is preached, it becomes like ointment poured forth. I
   have no belief in the preaching of Christ unsuccessfully. I think a
   dear Brother may preach the Gospel for years and see no conversions
   and, perhaps, there may be none just then, but they will come! I won't
   say this to myself to comfort myself. I would be afraid I was on the
   wrong tack if I did not see them, and I would say to those who preach
   the Master's Word faithfully, "It shall not return unto Him void."
   Christ is greatly glorified when His Gospel becomes a heart-breaker,
   like a hammer when it dashes the rock in pieces and becomes like a
   fire. Christ is glorified when a harlot gives up her evil trade, when
   the thief casts down the tools of his infamy, when the drunk lifts his
   last dram to his lips, when the blasphemer washes out his mouth and
   resolves to drink no more of the wine of cursing! God grant us that we
   may always pray that God will glorify Christ in marvelous and manifest
   conversions of extraordinary sinners being snatched from between the
   teeth of the old lion and made to dedicate the rest of their days to
   King Jesus! Now to close--

   IV. GOD HAS GLORIFIED CHRIST IN HIS KINGDOM.

   We have already said that Christ is glorified in His spiritual Kingdom
   in the midst of Zion. One is tempted to enlarge on that. The King is
   always glorious when he rules his people by good laws, when he has a
   happy and prosperous people. And our Lord Jesus Christ rules us with
   the best of laws, and happy are the citizens of the new Jerusalem--

   "The King is glorious, When in war He is victorious." And when He is
   beloved of His subjects, He certainly is victorious in war. The spoils
   belong to Him. All the virgins love Him and the saintly sons consecrate
   their purest affections to Him. Jesus Christ is exalted in His Church,
   then, as a King upon His Throne--and there God gives Him Glory for the
   present among the nations. Christ's Glory is not revealed as we desire
   it, though He rules by moral influence and the government is upon His
   shoulders. Perhaps if our eyes were opened, we would see in the
   progress of civilization and the various changes which have taken place
   in this world, much more of the influences of Christianity and
   certainly more of the power of Christ than we have been able to
   perceive at all times. Perhaps God is now writing and has been, during
   this last 6,000 years, a wonderful drama at the clearing up of which it
   will be seen from the first stroke of His pen to the last, God has
   glorified Christ! It may be so that the shaking of the nations, the
   revolutions and even the bloody wars shall all be compassed, and the
   one great whole of which it might be said at the commencement, as
   Virgil does in song--

   "Arms and the man I sing."

   It may be that He has written a great epic concerning the warfare of
   the righteous against evil, and the conquest of the mighty men. He has
   yet to restore this world and make it brighter than it was before and,
   Beloved, that God will exalt Christ in the latter days, let us never
   doubt that for a moment! And though men prophesy, making a profit by
   their prophecies and are always muddling and unsettling weak minds by
   their silly predictions, let us still hold to it that this world
   belongs to Christ, who bought it with His precious blood! And He will
   have it, every inch, and there is not a corner where the dark places of
   cruelty shall remain, not a spot where an idol shall hold its throne,
   not a hill or valley where superstition shall be permitted to linger!
   We have but to wait. Maybe we shall be gathered to our Father to wait
   in seren-er places than this, for it is ordained and none shall stay
   its coming, when Christ shall reign upon earth with His ancient Glory,
   and the whole earth, once an Augean stable, shall be cleansed by its
   Hercules, who shall make the stream of Hisblood to run through it, and
   make it pure, glorified and consecrated! And in that day the scepters
   shall be gathered with them who remain and crowns of kings shall be
   joyfully laid at His feet--and we shall understand the full meaning of
   the title, "King of Kings and Lord of Lords." Oh, how we will salute
   Him in that day when we shall rise to participate in the splendors with
   those who are alive and remain! Dear Friends, those who are asleep
   shall rise to participate in all the splendor of that blessed land of
   King Jesus! My Father has exalted You! To You, Your Master's children
   bow! The sun and the moon bow down before You! You shall reign and we
   shall reign with You--our reign being to behold Your reign--our glory
   being to participate in Your Glory! We shall be like You, for we shall
   see You as You are! May God grant us Grace to have our share in that
   blessed Advent and He shall be blessed!

   But now just one more word. God will glorify Christ, mark you, as He
   has done. Are we prepared to do the same, my dear Brothers and Sisters?
   Let us aim to glorify Christ--and shall I tell you how you may do it,
   for there are many small ways of doing it, not small in themselves, but
   only small comparatively? You can glorify Christ by your holy living,
   by your labors for His Kingdom, by your generosity, or, if you want to
   do the greatest work to glorify Christ, you know what it is! Why, it is
   to trust Him altogether with all your concerns! Nothing glorifies
   Christ more than that. Now just lean your whole weight on Him and, with
   a faith that does not stagger, rely on the efficacy of His blood, the
   power of His arm, the love of His heart, the immutability of His
   affections and the divinity of His Presence! Lean on Him! Rest on Him!
   A poor dependent creature cannot glorify God any better than by
   trusting Him! This is the work of God, you know--this is a Hebraism,
   for the greatest work of all, this is the work of God, the God-like
   work, the work! But what a mercy it is that there is such a way for
   poor creatures like we are, of glorifying Christ by trusting Him--

   "The best return for one like me,

   So wretched and so poor,

   Is from His gifts to draw a plea,

   And ask Him still for more."

   One other remark, and that is, if you don't glorify Jesus Christ
   willingly and cheerfully by such a trust, He will be glorified even in
   your condemnation! In the day of His appearing, you that have heard the
   Gospel--for I speak to you, only, if you reject Him, you will have yet
   to minister to His honor. "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you
   perish from the way if His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are
   all they that put their trust in Him." But if you trust Him not, here
   is the alternative--"He shall break the nations with a rod of iron, He
   shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." How stands it with
   you? Will you be able to endure that iron rod? Will you be able to
   endure the breaking, when first the body shall be broken, and then the
   soul to shivers, like a potter's vessel? Be wise, therefore, oh you
   kings and you men, sons of the earth! Be wise, bow before Him, accept
   Him as your King! God will thus be glorified by the work of Christ, and
   if it is not so, He will be glorified by the aid of justice, which may
   the Lord forbid in the case of any one of us! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH53.

   Verse 1. Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the
   LORD revealed?The Prophet seems to speak in the name of all the
   Prophets, lamenting the general unbelief concerning Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God. The report concerning Him is very clear. It comes from
   God--it is for our salvation--and yet how many disbelieve it! In fact,
   all do until the arm of the Lord is revealed--until He works upon the
   hearts of men and they are led to believe in Jesus. And here is the
   difficulty of belief.

   2. For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out
   of a dry ground: He has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see
   Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him. There was nothing
   about Jesus Christ to attract the attention of those who look for pomp
   and splendor. His religion is all simplicity. It is the plain Truth of
   God--there is nothing about it that is gorgeous to attract those who
   look after ritualistic vanities. To the most of men there is no beauty
   in Him that they should desire Him.

   3. He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
   with grief and we hid, as it were, our faces from Him. He was despised,
   and we esteemed Him not.It was so with Jesus when He was here. He was
   the greatest of all sufferers--there were few that followed Him--some
   of those who did, betrayed Him. There were few who would stand up for
   Him. He met everywhere with a repulse, and yet He came on an errand of
   love. He needed not to have come at all.

   Heaven surely was large enough for Him, but such was His pity for the
   dying sons of men that He must strip off His royal robes and put on the
   robes of our mortal flesh!

   4, 5. Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we
   did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was
   wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are
   healed. He had not a pang to suffer on His own account, nothing to
   cause Him grief in anything He had done--

   "For sins not His own, He died to atone--

   Was love or was sorrow like this ever known?" Scarcely for a righteous
   man will one die. Yet, perhaps, for a good man some would even dare to
   die. But God commends His love toward us, in that while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us.

   6. All we, like sheep, have gone astray, we have turned, everyone, to
   his own way and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all Taken
   the full load of sin, the whole mass of human guilt, and placed it upon
   Him! He was perfectly innocent, and yet was the sin of man heaped upon
   Him. He was our Substitute, standing in our place--a wondrous Truth of
   God is this!

   7. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth.
   He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb, so He opens not His mouth. And you know right well
   that our Master would not speak when He was charged before Pilate and
   Herod. He was eloquent--more eloquent in His silence than if He had
   used His ordinary language, which was amazing, for, "never man spoke
   like this Man," and yet never man was silent as He for our sake.

   8-10. He was taken fromprison and from judgment: and who shall declare
   His generation? For He was cut offout of the land of the living: for
   the transgression of My people was He stricken. And He made His grave
   with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; because He had done no
   violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD
   to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief: when You shall make His soul an
   offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and
   thepleasure ofthe Lord shall prosper in His hand. Our blessed Lord and
   Master is to have a full reward for all His griefs--and an earnest of
   that reward is here tonight! He will receive, this very night, some
   born unto Him by the new birth, who shall henceforth be His children
   and who shall gladly say, "Here, Lord, I come myself to You, for You
   have bought me with Your precious blood." It is the joy of some of us
   that we belong altogether to Christ. We would not have another
   honor--we wish to live to Him, loving Him and serving Him as long as we
   have any being! And there are some here tonight who have not felt this,
   whom God, nevertheless, will make to feel it, for so runs the promise--

   11. He shall see ofthe travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied. By
   His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many; for He shall
   bear their iniquities. That is the way He justifies them--takes their
   iniquities upon Himself--and since a thing cannot be in two places at
   one time, when Christ takes our iniquities, they are gone and we are
   just in the sight of God! He takes the burden, and we are unloaded,
   blessed be His name! "He shall bear their iniquities."

   12. Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall
   divide the spoil with the strong. The dying Christ has risen again, and
   He is now a great conqueror and divides the spoil. Those spoils are
   human hearts, and the true love and deep devotion of those He has
   redeemed. He shall have this--

   12. Because He has poured out His soul unto death: and He was numbered
   with the transgressors: and He bore the sin of many, and made
   intercession for the transgressors. And He is doing it now--pleading
   this very night that old prayer of His, "Father, forgive them, for they
   know not what they do." Oh, let you and I be pardoned with that plea!

Friendship's Guide

   (No. 3437)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 11, 1870.

   "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." John 15:14.

   IT is very easy to understand how Jesus Christ is our Friend. Did ever
   anyone deserve the name so well? Who can prove his friendship as Jesus
   proved it by laying down His life for those He calls His friends? But
   it is a mark of wonderful condescension on His part that He should call
   us His friends and it confers upon us the highest conceivable honor
   that such a Lord as He is, so infinitely superior to us, should
   condescend to enter into terms of friendship with us. My Friend, O
   Jesus, You are, for You have redeemed my soul from death and Hell--but
   that I should be Your friend--nothing but Your loving, condescending
   tenderness could ever have conceived of this! If you do put such a
   title as this upon me, teach me how I may act in conformity with it.
   Beloved, there is a mutual friendship between Christ and the Believer.
   There cannot be friendship if it is all on one side. There is bounty,
   there is kindness and there may be some gratitude in return, but
   friendship is a reciprocal thing. In its fullest sense, it is between
   two, and the one heart must be as the other heart, or else there is no
   friendship. Now every Believer is a friend to Jesus, and Jesus is a
   Friend to him. They are friends because they have a mutual love for
   each other. The Believer does not love His Lord as much as Jesus loves
   him, for his heart is little compared with Jesus' heart. But when the
   Believer is in a right state, he loves Jesus with all his heart, soul
   and strength. He feels that there is none in the world that can have a
   place in his affections at all comparable with his Lord and Master. He
   can say--

   "My Jesus I love You: I know You are mine, For You, all the follies of
   sin I resign."

   And if Jesus loves us, we also love Him. Friendship has in it a mutual
   delight. Two friends value each other. Now the delight of Jesus is with
   the sons of men. In those whom He has redeemed with His blood, He sees
   the satisfaction for the travail of His soul. He says of His Church
   that her name is Hephzibah--"My delight is in her"--and on the other
   hand, the Believer's delight is in Christ. "He is all my salvation and
   all my desire," says the Believer. "He is the chief among ten thousand,
   and the altogether lovely." None can be compared with Him. It is sweet
   to think of the saint looking on the Savior and the Savior looking on
   the saint--and the two, together, blending their love in mutual delight
   in each other. This love and this delight lead to mutual converse.
   Persons can hardly maintain friendship if they only see each other now
   and then. If there is no communion by letter or in any other way, I
   should think friendship could scarcely be maintained. But oh, Jesus
   reveals Himself to His people and His people tell out their hearts to
   Jesus! Do not suppose that because He is not here, for He is risen,
   that therefore we have no conversation with Him. Our prayers speak into
   His ears, our tears fall into His heart. When we are wounded, His
   wounds bleed afresh. He is the Head, and we the members and, however
   great the body, if you wound the body, the head feels it at once, so
   close is the communion. Yes, and we do converse with Him in meditation,
   in adoration, alone in our chambers. Though we have not seen Him with
   these eyes, which are, after all, poor things, we have seen Him with
   our soul's eyes, which are brighter eyes by far! And as we have beheld
   Him, our soul has melted for joy in the glance of His beauty.

   Now to make friendship, there will be not only mutual love, delight,
   and conversation, but friends must have harmony of thought. I will not
   say identity, for man and man must always be two, and Christ and His
   people, though one in some respects, are two existences. But though two
   notes, though different, may be in perfect harmony, so is it with the
   heart of Christ and the heart of His renewed child. What Jesus loves,
   we love. what Jesus hates, we hate. What Jesus seeks,we seek--what
   Jesus shuns, we shun. This is true friendship when there is but one
   heart in two bodies, and when one heart in the two produces with
   undivided strength one objective. Now Christ's objective is His
   Father's Glory. If you are Christ's friends, that objective is yours,
   too. His objective is to seek and save the lost--if you love Him, you
   also seek to save the lost in your way. He loves truth, holiness,
   righteousness. He delights in that which puts an end to misery, to
   evil, to cruelty, to wrong-doing. Do you delight in the same? If so,
   unity of design, harmony of thought will very greatly make up the
   friendship between you and Jesus. Oh, and we are going to the same
   great end! Where He is, there our hearts are drawn. We are living here
   for the same purpose that brought Him here--and when our work is done,
   the same reward that gladdened Him, shall also gladden us--we also
   shall enter into the joy of our Lord! Some of you do not know much
   about this--I am talking strange things to some of you. Jesus--yes, you
   read of Him. Jesus--you hear of Him. It is proper to receive His name,
   but oh, you have never spoken with Him! You have never known Him to be
   real nor conceived of Him as such! I pray that you may be made
   spiritual, may be born-again. Until you are, you cannot be a friend of
   Christ. But when you are, and may it come now, this very hour, may you
   discover that He is a great Friend, and then, out of love to Him, may
   you become a friend of His!

   Now we are not left in the dark as friends of Jesus as to the best way
   of showing our friendship. Two persons may be great friends and one may
   wish to serve the other, and say, "I hardly know what I can do to
   please my friend. I wish I knew his needs. I wish I knew his desires--I
   would strive to gratify them." Now you have, tonight, given to you as
   lovers of Jesus--you have the guide as to how you can prove yourselves
   His friends. "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." We
   have, then, in the text, the guide for friendship, and I will say this
   about it--it contains seven things. The first is--

   I. TRUE FRIENDS OF CHRIST, HIMSELF, DISTINCTLY ACKNOWLEDGE HIS TRUE
   POSITION TOWARDS THEMSELVES.

   That position is contained in these words, "I command you." We are
   friends of Jesus, but Jesus must still be first--"I command you." The
   genuine friend of Christ does not command himself--he has taken
   Christ's yoke upon him and is now Christ's servant. He does not, now,
   follow his own whims in religion, nor does he think he is to be
   dictator to himself. In becoming Christ's friend, he agrees to
   subordinate his mind and will to the supremacy of Christ Jesus the
   Lord. Now then, friend of Jesus, note this! You are not your own--from
   now on not your own master, neither are you your own guide. I am often
   afraid when I hear persons talk of the glorious excellence of liberty
   of conscience, that they make a mistake as to what liberty of
   conscience is. What is liberty of conscience? Is it liberty to believe
   anything I like--liberty to hold any Doctrine I please? No! It is such
   liberty with regard to the civil magistrate and with regard to my
   fellow man. Before my fellow man I have a right to believe what I will,
   and he may not call me to account--I am free there. But does such
   freedom exist before God? I think not! The friend of Jesus asks to have
   his conscience taught. He lays his judgment at the feet of the great
   Teacher and all the liberty that he wants for his conscience is to have
   it purified and cleansed, that it may be a fit guide for him to
   follow--otherwise a distorted, perverted, dark, polluted conscience may
   as readily lead a man to Hell as if he never had a conscience at all!
   It is not because I am conscientious that I am right. As I have often
   told you, a man may conscientiously drink arsenic or prussic acid and
   believe that it will do him good--but he would die for all that. Ah,
   and a man might conscientiously believe a lie, and he will reap the
   fruit of that lie! You are a friend of Jesus, to take your command from
   His lips and lay down at His feet, for He says, "I command you."

   But mark, though Christ has to command His friends, we are not to let
   anyone else command us. Oh, shun the slavery of all who take their
   religion from men, be they who they may, whether called priests or
   presbyters, or from human creeds or books! Read them, gather what you
   can from them all, but, "One is your Master, even Christ," and all you
   are brethren. No Church may lord it over your minds, for the Church may
   err, but not so Christ. "Whatever I command you," says He. He is
   Infallible--He will bid you do no ill! But a Church of fallible men is
   still fallible, and may slide aside, first a little, then more, then
   much, then monstrously--then utterly apostatize from the faith of God's
   elect! Therefore your Guide, your Leader, is no one but Jesus! "Do
   whatever I command you." There is too much among us of doing whatever
   our particular religion may command us. I charge you, Brothers and
   Sisters, do nothing of the sort! What are your councils? What are your
   assemblies? Nothing--less than nothing, I think! If they decree
   anything contrary to God's will, they are mischief makers. Christ is
   the Head of the Church, and He has not vacated His high position in the
   midst of His Israel. Yield to Him! Go to the fountainhead, the statute
   book that shows His will, and get it there.

   You have enough there, though all contradict you. You have enough
   there, and all the councils of the fathers, and all the Church will be
   less than the small dust in the balance if you find not the law to be
   Christ's! Whatever He says, the true friend of Jesus does--neither less
   nor more--for he knows that none can legislate in his realm but the
   King, Himself, and all that pretend to legislate do but err when they
   get away from the, "It is written," of the grand old Word of God!

   Remember, too, all friends of Christ's, that this Doctrine of Christ's
   supremacy stands good always. He is your Lord and He is to command you
   everywhere, not only in your religious thought, but at home, in the
   chamber, in the parlor, in the drawing room, outside, in the street, on
   the mart, on the Exchange, in your shop. His rule contained in His own
   life--His Golden Rule, "Do you to others as you would have them do to
   you"--His new commandment that you love one another--these are always
   binding! A soldier may have a furlough, but a Christian never does. You
   might plead that concerning such-and-such a law you were exempt before
   men--but to Christ you are never exempt, nor would you wish to be, for
   His service is freedom, and His Law, O friend of Christ, has now become
   your delight! Grasp, then, that first thought, "You are My friends if I
   command you"--if you recognize Him as being the Leader and the
   Commander unto you, His people. You must recognize Christ in that
   capacity--and Him only--or you are not His friends!

   But note, again, the text has in it a word which I may paraphrase in
   this way--

   II. WE ARE TO RECOGNIZES OUR OWN PERSONAL OBLIGATIONS.

   You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. The mass of
   mankind who pretend to be religious, suppose this Bible to be written
   to all sorts of good people, but not particularly to themselves. And
   there are they who think that the commands of Christ are very proper to
   be read, and to be heard, and to be proclaimed--but they do not look
   upon them as being binding on themselves. Friend of Jesus, Jesus has a
   right to your service and to your obedience! What He bids, He bids
   you--if to no other, yet to you. Then the zeal of some good men does
   not exempt me. If my minister is very useful, that is not myself. I am
   Christ's friend if I do whatever He commands me. Then the intense
   fervor of the Church does not permit me to recoil and say, "There is
   nothing for me to do." No, I am His friend if I do what He commands me.
   If, on the other hand, I dwell among a slumbering Church, if I see all
   around me the signs of sloth, yet I am not to judge the Church and
   excuse myself, and say, "I do as much as others--perhaps a little more.
   I am not so hardhearted as So-and-So." Oh, Sirs, what have you to do
   with your brethren, with your fellow servants? To your own Master you
   must stand or fall, as they must--and you are Christ's friend if you do
   whatever He commands you! It does seem to be very difficult to get men
   to individualize themselves in the things of God. They do not count
   themselves rich because England is rich--they do not consider
   themselves to be getting rich because the bank interest rate is lower!
   They want to get the solid coins in their own grasp and to their own
   banking account! But when I come to religion, men talk of this
   denomination and that Church, and that other--anything but about
   themselves! But you, O friend of Christ, you must live before the Lord
   as though there were no other! "You are My friends if you do whatever I
   command you." Now we will lay the force of our thought on another word.
   Observe here that--

   III. THE TRUE FRIEND OF CHRIST OBSERVES CAREFULLY ALL THAT CHRIST SAYS.

   It is not "You are My friends if you do some things that I command
   you." But, "You are My friends if you do whatever I command
   you"--whatever. Are there public duties? Do they require courage? I
   must perform them. Are there private duties? Are they unseen of men?
   They are as much incumbent upon me--I must discharge them. Are there
   commands of precept by way of ordinance? I must keep them. Are there
   commands by way of morals? I must obey them, however hard or stern they
   may seem. Whatever Christ commands is the Law to His people. O England,
   England, when will the day come back when this Book which is said to be
   the only religion of Protestants shall be truly so? The Bible, and the
   Bible, only, is the religion of Protestants--so they say, but it is not
   so! There are many things practiced by so-called Protestants that are
   not here! Where are your holy baptisms? Where are your confirmations?
   Where are half the ceremonies, if not all, of the Church of England and
   many other bodies? They are inventions of man, and man only, having not
   so much as a shred or trace of foundation in God's own Book! You have
   made another book--your bishops have made another book--and laid it on
   the top of God's own book, and these are your Bible--not the Bible, and
   the Bible only, but the Book of Common Prayer! And with other
   denominations--dissenting denominations--there is too much of the same
   sort of thing. "What said John Calvin?" What care I what he said, or
   did not say? "What said John Wesley?" What care I what John Wesley
   said, or did not say? The Master--the MASTER--let us do whatever HE
   commands us! These were His good servants, as I believe, both of them,
   John Wesley and John Calvin--and if they did better than I, which I
   know they did, therein will I rejoice and bless God, and wherein they
   followed the Master, I, with unequal footsteps, would seek to follow,
   too--but to say that I will do this because John this or John that
   taught it--shame on the Christian that dares to bow his head to such a
   yoke as that! Let every Christian contend for this--that he is to do
   whatever Christ commands! Does it kick over the conventionalities of
   the Church? Let them go over! Does it burn the tag rags you thought so
   much of--your venerable things that you laid up as holy relics? Burn
   every one of them! What right have they to stand in contradiction to
   the Law of Christ? No, whatever He commands--not more, not less--this
   is to be our religion and our Law, and to it let every Christian stand!
   Happy day shall it be for the Church and for the world when this is
   true! Once more, it is clear from one word, that--

   IV. THE TEXT IS VERY PRACTICAL.

   "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you"--not "if you do
   some things." Not, "if you talk about it," for lip service is
   hypocrisy! Not, "if you tell others to do it"--there is a great deal of
   religion that is very much like charity, and you know what charity is!
   A sees B is very badly off and he writes a letter at once to C to help
   B. So is it with re-ligion--A sees it a duty that such a thing should
   be done and tells B that he is very wrong not to do it. That is what is
   called religion. But as I understand religion, it is this--A sees B
   needing help and gives it to him! A sees a duty and does it, himself,
   and after he has done it, himself, then he may talk to B about it--but
   not till then! "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you."
   Well, some of you have been thinking about it a long while--it is time
   for you to do it! He commands you to love your brother--you have been
   talking about that--well, do it! Don't grumble and complain, and
   criticize any longer. You know He commands you to forgive any who
   offend you. Do not know it any longer, but go and doit! Some of you
   believe that you ought to be baptized and make a profession of your
   faith. What is the good of thinking of it? Go and do it! Go and do it!
   It is in the keeping of His commandments that there is great reward! He
   does not do the will of God who says, "Well, I am turning it over, and
   one of these days I suppose I shall be moved to do it." What do you
   need to move you but this--that you owe everything to Christ--and that
   Christ commands you? A soldier in the day of battle only needs the
   command, and on he marches--and a true friend of Jesus pays to Him as
   perfect an obedience as a soldier to his captain, or at least he
   desires to do it. A lift of Jesus' finger and away he goes! One look
   from Jesus' eyes shall cause him to stop, or make a rapid advance, just
   as the word may be!

   V. THIS COMMAND IS VERY SIMPLE.

   I shall close by commending this text to you because it is so. You are
   My friends if you acknowledge Me your Master in everything--your own
   personal Master--and then do what I tell you. Now how plain is this?
   There is no mistake about it. It is obedience Christ asks for! "To obey
   is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams." And what
   a blessing it is that this text gives us such a very simple thing to
   do! Suppose Jesus Christ were to say, "That man is My friend who will
   support a minister, who will build a place of worship, who will go out
   abroad for a missionary." Oh, there are some of you who would weep and
   say, "I can do none of those things! I wish I could! It would be my
   greatest pleasure if I could." My dear Friends, the poorest man, the
   poorest woman here who is a true friend of Christ can do this--you can
   do whatever He commands you! By the power of His blessed Spirit who has
   made you love Him, you can watch earnestly to be holy, to be loving as
   Jesus was. The notion with a great many is, "I need to show that I am
   Christ's friend--now I must shut myself up and get away from
   everybody." That is not what Christ says! He says, "Do whatever I
   command you"--not run away from the battle, but fight through and win
   it. "No, but," says another, "what can I do to praise my Savior? I must
   speak about Him." Yet, perhaps, that dear friend could not put three
   words together consecutively. Dear Brother, if God has not given you
   that gift, you need not cry that you have not got it! Go and do
   whatever He commands you--that will be better than sacrifice. I know
   some persons who are very attentive to sermons. I am glad they are.
   They wish to get out on weeknights, and I am glad they are. I wish all
   were able to. But many a mother will be serving God much better by
   keeping the house clean, and the garments mended, than by coming to
   hear a sermon! You must do whatever He commands you, and what He
   commands you as a wife, is to discharge a wife's duty.

   When I sometimes see a religious serving man, a great talker, who does
   not groom his employer's horses well, and who, if he can get an excuse
   for leaving work, will, I think, "That man might do more good in
   minding his employer's business than in running here and there to make
   a show of religion." I believe plain, holy, godly living is more
   needed-- a great deal more--than fine preaching! And if my preaching
   does not, by God's Grace, produce in you a finer character than that,
   then I am preaching for nothing! I heard of a man the other day who
   could preach with his feet, and I know agreat many who do. That is,
   preaching with living and daily walk and conversation. It is, after
   all, to be upright in business, to be affectionate in the family, to
   make those around you happy, to liveChrist--that is, after all, true
   friendship with Christ! No big words of ready talkers, no polished
   periods, no gift of prayer will ever be so acceptable to the Lord Jesus
   Christ as the simple piety that graces the fireside, that adorns the
   private and the public life of the Believer. "You are My friends if you
   do whatever I command you." Practically to prove that Jesus Christ is
   your Lord is the highest service that you can, any of you, render to
   Him! May God help you to render it from this time forth with
   undeviating correctness! And with the help of His Spirit may you yet do
   it more and more. Let me conclude by observing that though this seems a
   very simple thing, yet after all--

   VI. IT IS A MOST USEFUL AND NECESSARY THING.

   It is not possible that a rebel should be a friend to Christ. If a man
   says of any Law of Christ, "I do not mean to keep that," then, Sir, you
   have virtually said, "I do not mean to have Christ for my Lord," and
   that means that you cannot have Him as your Savior. If you do not know
   a thing to be Christ's, well, I believe you are still sinful, for you
   ought to know it. The laws of our country never excuse a person for
   breaking the law because he says he did not know the law. It is
   presumed that everybody ought to know it. And the Bible is not such a
   Book as they cannot understand if they try. Any person can find out
   Christ's will if he likes. But suppose you know it is Christ's will,
   and do not choose to do it--if you put your foot down and say, "I shall
   not do it," then there is an end of all friendship! Obedience, then, is
   an essential of true friendship to Christ, for those who make a
   profession of friendship and don't do what He commands are the worst
   enemies He has! No city that is besieged need fear so much the enemy
   outside, as treachery inside. If there is known to be treachery inside,
   then the stress of war becomes severe. So if inside the Church there
   are persons who deliberately say, "We are disciples of Christ, but we
   will not be obedient to His will," there is sedition and treason inside
   the camp! And these are they of whom Paul said, "I have told you even
   weeping--that they are the enemies, the special enemies, of the Cross
   of Christ." And let me say this keeping of the Law of Christ is, after
   all--

   VII. THE BEST WAY OF SERVING HIM AS A MATTER OF USEFULNESS.

   Sermons preached at home are the best sermons. Sermons at sick beds by
   holy women, sermons to drunk husbands by the patient godliness of the
   much-suffering wife, sermons by holy fathers and mothers in their
   loving anxiety for wayward sons and daughters, sermons by servants in
   the rectitude of their conduct to their employers, sermons by Christian
   tradesmen preached in their bills and in their trade by strict
   attention to everything upright--these are sermons that the world must
   hear! These are things that will glorify Christ! These are the most
   friendly actions that you can do for Jesus. You raise His name in the
   market, you make men think the better of His religion by the holiness
   and consistency of your conduct. You are His friend!

   I dismiss you with this upon your minds. If you are His friends, obey
   His command, imitate His example and seek to have this not in theory,
   but as a matter of fact of daily life. The day will come, my Hearers,
   when to be a friend of Christ will be the grandest thing beneath the
   heavens. He is an exiled Prince in regard to this world, now, and men
   despise Him, but He is coming to His crown before long! And when He
   shall appear in the clouds of Heaven, as He shortly shall, all those
   who were His friends on earth, who stood in the pillory with Him and
   suffered for Him--these shall shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of
   His Father! Oh, it will then be a grand day, a brave day, for those who
   died for Him, for those who were made poor for conscience sake, for
   those who left kindred and friends for His name. I think I hear the
   King say, "Make way, angels! Make way, cherubim and seraphim! These
   poor men and women were friends of Mine! When I was in exile, they
   suffered with Me. They were willing to bear reproach for Me--let them
   come! They shall be courtiers round My Throne. They were friends of
   Mine in My humiliation--they shall be friends with Me in My Glory.
   "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
   from before the foundation of the world." And oh, how will all men who
   were notHis friends--how they will hide their heads and wish they had
   never been born to continue at enmity with Him! They did not know who
   it was they were despising when they laughed at His people. They did
   not know what it was they trampled on when they put their profane feet
   upon the Cross of Christ. They did not know who they insulted when they
   broke the Sabbath and lived godless, Christless lives--but they will
   know it then, when they see the King on His throne, for their cry will
   be--their bitter lament shall be--"Fall on us, you mountains! Cover us,
   you rocks, and hide us--hide us from the face of Him that sits on the
   Throne." What? Can you not face Him? You used to jeer at His people!
   You used to say, "It is all nonsense, this religion." Cannot you face
   Him? Cannot you face Him? He has not spoken yet! No thunderbolts are in
   His hand. Can you not face Him? No, they are ashamed--they dare not
   look, they dare not gaze on such heavenly beauty! They seek
   shelter--they hold their hands before their eyes. They ask the
   mountains to afford them a hiding place, for could they be such fools
   as to despise Him who died for His enemies, to despise the Christ of
   God, to despise the Everlasting Creator who out of mighty love, gave up
   His life for men? Before He speaks a word, before He pronounces a
   sentence, this shame shall begin their Hell, "Hide us from the face of
   Him that sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb."

   God bless you, dear Friends, save you by His great mercy, richly bless
   every one of you and make you Christ's friends. Amen and amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN12:37-50; ISAIAH 6.

   Verse 37. But though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they
   believed not on Him. They had an opportunity of seeing with their eyes
   what the Christ could do. He had even raised the dead in the midst of
   them--and yet this is the sorrowful statement.

   38-40. That the saying of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, which
   he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of
   the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe, because that
   Isaiah said again, He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts
   that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
   hearts and be converted, and I should heal them.This passage is very
   frequently quoted in the Old Testament--it was so exceedingly
   appropriate to the condition of the unbelieving Jews. They were
   willfully blinded. They could see it. They were forced to hear it.
   There was much that even touched their hearts, but they hardened their
   hearts against it, and to this day they remain the same!

   41-43. These things said Isaiah, when he saw His glory and spoke of
   Him. Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on Him;
   but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should
   be put out of the synagogue. For they loved the praise of men more than
   the praise of God. And this is a common disease to this day. There are
   many who know the Truths of God who, nevertheless, keep very quiet
   about it. They do not like to be despised. They cannot endure to seem
   to be separate from their fellow men--it is not respectable to be
   decided for Christ and to come out from among them--so they love the
   praise of men more than the praise of God!

   44. Jesus cried and said, He that believes on Me, believes not on Me,
   but on Him that sent Me. Faith in Christ is faith in God--he that
   trusts the Son has accepted the witness of the Father!

   45. And He that sees Me sees Him that sent Me.Wonderful expression!
   Perhaps we never fully realize it. Christ is seeable. God is not--but
   when we see the Christ, we do virtually see all of God that we may
   desire to see! The Invisible has made Himself visible in Christ--in Him
   dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

   46. I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on Me
   should not abide in darkness. True faith in Christ sheds light on
   everything concerning which light is desirable. You shall understand
   things when you have come unto the right standpoint, when you have
   gotten to believe in Christ. I wonder not that those who doubt
   concerning Him, doubt about everything--if they will not have this
   light, how shall they see?

   47. And if any man hears My words and believes not, I judge him not:
   for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. Under this
   present dispensation, it is not the time of judgment. The Lord leaves
   you that are unbelievers to yourselves. He does not come as yet, to
   judge you--there is a Second Coming when He will be both Judge and
   Witness-- and Condemner of those who have rejected Him! But at present
   it is a dispensation of pure mercy. "He that rejects Me, and receives
   not My words, has One that judges Him." There is a great God above who
   reckons this to be among the greatest of all human crimes--that they
   reject His Son. We speak of unbelief very lightly, and there are some
   who trifle with it as if it had no moral quality at all--but God does
   not!

   48. He that rejects Me, and receives not My words, has One that judges
   him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last
   day. Look, you, to that--the Gospel which you refuse will judge you at
   the last day! We know that the Lord Jesus Christ shall judge the world,
   says Paul, "according to my Gospel," and he that sins against the
   Gospel of love will certainly involve himself in the most solemn
   condemnation! He perishes that sins against the law--he dieswithout
   mercy at the mouth of one or two witnesses. Of how much sorer
   punishment shall he be thought worthy, who sins against love and
   rejects the Savior?

   49. For I have not spoken of Myself; but the Father which sent Me, He
   gave Me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.God
   at the back of Christ. Omnipotence supporting Love. The expostulations
   of Christ, not left to our will to do as we like with them, but
   solemnly sanctioned by the royalties of God, so that to refute them is
   treason against the Majesty of Heaven!

   50. And I know that His commandment is life everlasting: whatever I
   speak, therefore, even as the Father said unto Me, so I speak.The
   eternal authority of God is at the back of the testimony of Christ. Oh,
   that men would not be so unwise as to reject it! Now in our reading at
   the 41st verse we met with these words-- "These things said Isaiah,
   when he saw His Glory and spoke of Him." Now let us read the passage
   which gives us an account of Isaiah's seeing the Glory of Christ.

   ISAIAH 6.

   Verse 1. In the year King Uzziah died. You remember him, that leprous
   king, that king who had thrust himself into the priests' office and was
   struck with leprosy, and shut up in a separate house during the rest of
   his life. In the year that he died, Isaiah saw a greater King, whom no
   defilement can ever touch, a King that reigns and lives forever, though
   Uz-ziah dies.

   1. I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and
   His train filled the Temple. Whenever you read in the Old Testament
   that any man saw the Lord--understand it is the Second Person of the
   Divine Trinity--the Lord Jesus Christ! He makes Himself, as we have
   said, visible to men, and God in Him.

   2. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with two he
   covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did
   fly.There are the spirits that dwell in the Presence of God, nearest to
   Him, and as He is a consuming fire, they come to be like He, for the
   seraphims are burning ones, consumers, burning and shining lights who
   wait upon God who is Light of Life. Notice how humble they are in that
   Presence--they cover themselves before that Infinite Majesty!

   3. 4. And one cried upon another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
   LORD ofHosts: the whole earth is full ofHis Glory. And the posts of the
   door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled
   with smoke. And if even the voice of a seraph moved the very
   foundations of the Temple, what will the voice of God do when He shall
   speak once more? According to that word, He shall shake not only earth,
   but also Heaven! What awe and trembling should be upon us when we wait
   upon God, if even the posts of the doors move! "Then said I, woe is
   me!" All God's saints do this when they get a view of Him. There was
   never a boastful thought in any man's mind in the Presence of God. They
   that talk of their own purity have not known God, neither seen Him. How
   could they? This is the cry of all the purified when they come into the
   Presence of God--"Woe is me, for I am undone; because I am a man of
   unclean lips." What made him think of lips, but the voice of the
   seraphim as responsively they cried to one another, "Holy, holy, holy"?
   ThenIsaiah thought of his own lips! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, what
   impurity comes out of our lips! Perhaps more, there, than anywhere else
   is the impurity of the heart discovered in our idle words, our evil
   words.

   5-7. Then said I, Woe is me! For I am undone because I am a man of
   unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for
   my eyes have seen the King, the LORD ofHosts. Then flew one of the
   seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken
   with the tongs from off the altar And he laid it upon my mouth and
   said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away,
   and your sin purged. Just where Isaiah felt the impurity, there he felt
   the expiation! His lips were unclean, but now a touch of the altar
   coal, a communication from the great Sacrifice, has taken all his
   iniquity away and his sin is buried!

   8. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and
   who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I: send me.Observe the unity
   and the plurality, "Whom shall Isend, and who will go for Us?" Upon
   what theory, but that of the Doctrine of the Trinity, can we explain so
   singular a change from the singular to the plural? "Whom shall I send,
   and who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I: send me." This man, now
   so lowly, so purified with the vision of God, just seen by Him, how
   cheerfully does he spring forward at the word of invitation! "Here am
   I: send me." Now see what asorrowful mission, God, in these next
   verses, assured Isaiah that his ministry so far as the conversion of
   the Jews were concerned, would be altogether fruitless! They would not
   receive his testimony.

   9, 10. And He said Go, and tell this people, Hear you, indeed, but
   understand not; and see you, indeed, but perceive not Make the heart of
   this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes lest
   they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with
   their heart, and convert, and be healed. What a ministry--dark with
   insufferable light! So bright, so clear, that men should have willfully
   to harden their hearts and shut their eyes if they did not understand
   and receive it!

   11, 12. Then said I, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities
   are wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land
   is utterly desolate. And the LORD has removed men far away and there is
   a great forsaking in the midst of the land So it happened, as you
   know--the people were carried away captive. They still refused-- they
   would not believe even when Christ came! And then the destruction of
   Jerusalem and the sweeping clear of their country was the final stroke
   of God. "But yet in it shall be a tenth." There is always gleam of
   light from God's Grace in the thickest darkness of His Justice. God has
   His tithe.

   13. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be
   eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when
   they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof
   And, therefore, the Jewish nation is not destroyed, but still
   exists--and the Church of God is not destroyed, despite all that
   happens to it. There is a substance in it, according to the election of
   Grace, for which may God be praised!

The Compassion of Jesus

   (No. 3438)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He was moved with compassion." Matthew 9:36.

   THIS is said of Christ Jesus several times in the New Testament. The
   original word is a very remarkable one. It is not found in classic
   Greek. It is not found in the Septuagint. The fact is, it was a word
   coined by the Evangelists, themselves. They did not find one in the
   whole Greek language that suited their purpose and, therefore, they had
   to make one. It is expressive of the deepest emotion--a striving of the
   heart--a yearning of the innermost nature with pity. As the
   dictionaries tell us--Ex intimis visceribus misericordia commoveor. I
   suppose that when our Savior looked upon certain sights, those who
   watched Him closely perceived that His internal agitation was very
   great, His emotions were very deep and then His face betrayed it--His
   eyes gushed like fountains with tears and you saw that His big heart
   was ready to burst with pity for the sorrow upon which His eyes were
   gazing. He was moved with compassion. His whole Nature was agitated
   with commiseration for the sufferers before Him.

   Now, although this word is not used many times even by the Evangelists,
   yet it may be taken as a clue to the Savior's whole life--and I intend
   thus to apply it to Him. If you would sum up the whole Character of
   Christ in reference to ourselves, it might be gathered into this one
   sentence, "He was moved with compassion." Upon this one point we shall
   try to insist, now, and may God grant that good practical results may
   come of it. First, I shall lead your meditations to the great
   transactions of our Savior's life. Secondly, to the special instances
   in which this expression is used by the Evangelists. Thirdly, to the
   forethought which He took on our behalf and, fourthly, to the personal
   testimony which one's own recollections can furnish. Let us take a
   rapid survey of--

   I. THE GREAT LIFE OF CHRIST, just touching, as with a swallow's wing,
   the evidence it bears from the beginning. Before ever the earth was
   framed. Before the foundations of the everlasting hills were laid. When
   as yet the stars had not begun their shining, it was known to God that
   His creature, man, would sin--that the whole race would fall from its
   pure original state in the first Adam, the Covenant Head as well as the
   common parent of the entire human family, and that in consequence of
   that one man's disobedience every soul born of his lineage would become
   a sinner. Then, as the Creator knew that His creatures would rebel
   against Him, He saw that it would become necessary, eventually, to
   avenge His injured Law. Therefore, it was purposed, in the eternal
   plan, before the stream of time had commenced its course, or ages had
   began to accumulate their voluminous records, that there should be an
   Interposer--One ordained to come and re-head the race, to be the Second
   Adam, a federal Chief to restore the breach, and repair the mischief of
   the first Adam--to be a Surety to answer for the sons of men on whom
   God's love did light, that their sins should be laid upon Him--and that
   He should save them with an everlasting salvation. No angel could
   venture to intrude into those Divine counsels and decrees, or to offer
   himself as the surety and sponsor for that New Covenant. Yet there was
   One-- and He none other than Jehovah's Self--of whom He said, Let all
   the angels of God worship Him, the Son, the Well-Beloved of the Father,
   of whom it is written in the Word, "When He prepared the heavens I was
   there. When He set a compass upon the face of the depth, when He
   established the clouds above, when He strengthened the fountains of the
   deep" then, "I was by Him as One brought up with Him, and I was daily
   His delight, rejoicing always before Him, rejoicing in the habitable
   parts of the earth; and My delights were with the sons of men." He it
   is of whom the Apostle John speaks as the Lord who was God, and was in
   the beginning with God. Was He not moved with compassion when He
   entered into a Covenant with His Father on our behalf, even on the
   behalf of all His chosen--a Covenant in which He wasto be the Sufferer
   and they the gainers--in which He was to bear the shame that He might
   bring them into His own Glory?

   Yes, verily, He was even then moved with compassion for His delights,
   even then, were with the sons of men! Nor did His compassion peer forth
   in the prospect of an emergency presently to diminish and disappear as
   the rebellion took a more active form, and the ruin assumed more
   palpable proportions. It was no transient feeling. He still continued
   to pity men. He saw the fall of man. He marked the subtle serpent's
   mortal sting. He watched the trail as the slime of the serpent passed
   over the fair glades of Eden. He observed man in his evil progress,
   adding sin to sin through generation after generation, fouling every
   page of history until God's patience had been tried to the uttermost!
   And then, according as it was written in the volume of the Book that He
   must appear--Jesus Christ came, Himself, into this stricken world! Came
   how? O, be astonished, you angels, that you were witnesses of it, and
   you men that you beheld it! The Infinite came down to earth in the form
   of an Infant! He who spans the heavens and holds the ocean in the
   hollow of His hand, condescended to hang upon a woman's breast--the
   Eternal King became a little Child! Let Bethlehem tell that He had
   compassion! There was no way of saving us but by stooping to us! To
   bring earth up to Heaven, He must bring Heaven down to earth!
   Therefore, in the Incarnation, He had compassion, for He took upon
   Himself our infirmities and was made like unto ourselves. Matchless
   pity, indeed, was this!

   Then, while He tarried in the world, a Man among men, and we beheld His
   Glory, the Glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of Grace
   and Truth, He was constantly moved with compassion, for He felt all the
   griefs of mankind in Himself. He took our sicknesses and carried our
   sorrows. He proved Himself a true Brother, with quick, human
   sensibilities. A tear brought a tear into His eyes, a cry made Him
   pause to ask what help He could render. So generous was His soul that
   He gave all He had for the help of those who had not. The fox had its
   hole, and the bird its nest, but He had no dwelling place. Stripped
   even of His garments, He hung upon the Cross to die. Never one so
   indigent in death as He, without a friend, without even a tomb, except
   such as a loan could find Him. He gave up all the comforts of life--He
   gave His life, itself--He gave His very Self to prove that He was moved
   with compassion! Most of all do we see how He was moved with compassion
   in His terrible death. Oft and oft again have I told this story, yet
   these lips shall be dumb before they cease to reiterate the old, old
   tidings. God must punish sin, or else He would relinquish the
   government of the universe. He could not let iniquity go unchastened
   without compromising the purity of His administration. Therefore, the
   Law must be honored, Justice must be vindicated, righteousness must be
   upheld, crime must be expiated by suffering! Who, then, shall endure
   the penance or make the reparation? Shall the dread sentence fall upon
   all mankind? How far shall vengeance proceed before equity is
   satisfied? After what manner shall the sword do homage to the scepter?
   Must the elect of God be condemned for their sins? No! Jesus is moved
   with compassion. He steps in, He takes upon Himself the uplifted lash
   and His shoulders run with gore! He bares His bosom to the furbished
   sword and it smites the Shepherd that the sheep may escape! "He looked,
   and there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor;
   therefore, His arm brought salvation." He trod the winepress alone, and
   "bore, that we might never bear, His Father's righteous ire."

   Are you asked what does the Crucifixion of a perfect Man upon a felon's
   Cross, mean? You may reply, "He was moved with compassion." "He saved
   others. Himself He could not save." He was so moved with compassion,
   that compassion, as it were, did eat Him up! He could save nothing from
   the general conflagration--He was utterly consumed with love and died
   in the flame of ardent love towards the sons of men! And after He had
   died and slept a little while in the grave, He rose again! He has gone
   into His glory! He is living at the right hand of the Father! But this
   is just as true of Him--"He is moved with compassion." Is proof needed?
   Let faith pass within the veil and let your spirits, for a moment,
   stand upon that sea of glass mingled with fire where the harpers stand
   tuning their never ceasing melodies! What? Do you see there,
   conspicuous in the very midst of Heaven, One who looks like a lamb that
   has been slain, and still wears His priesthood? What is His occupation
   there in Heaven? He has no bloody Sacrifice to offer, for He has
   perfected forever those that were set apart! That work is done, but
   what is He doing now? He is pleading for His people! He is their
   perpetual Advocate, their continual Intercessor! He never rests until
   they come to their rest! He never holds His peace for them, but pleads
   the merit of His blood, and will do so till all whom the Father gave
   Him shall be with Him where He is! Well, indeed, does our hymn express
   it--

   "Now, though He reigns exalted high,

   His love is still as great! Well He remembers Calvary, Nor will His
   saints forget."

   His tender heart pities all the griefs of His dear people. There is not
   a pang they have but the Head feels it, feels it for all the members!
   Still does He look upon their imperfections and their infirmities, yet
   not with anger, not with loss of patience, but with gentleness and
   sympathy, "He is moved with compassion." Having thus briefly sketched
   the life of Christ, I want you to turn to--

   II. THOSE PASSAGES OF THE EVANGELISTS IN WHICH THEY TESTIFY THAT HE WAS
   MOVED WITH COMPASSION.

   You will find one case in Matthew 20:31--"Two blind men sat by the
   wayside begging, and when they heard that Jesus passed by, they said,
   "O Lord, You Son of David, have mercy on us." Jesus stood still, called
   them, questioned them and they seem to have had full conviction that He
   could and would restore their sight, so Jesus had compassion on them,
   touched their eyes and immediately they received sight!

   Yes, and what a lesson this is for any here present who have a like
   conviction! Do you believe that Christ can heal you? Do you believe
   that He is willing to heal you? Then let me assure you that a channel
   of communication is opened between Him and you, for He is moved with
   compassion towards you, and already I hear Him command you to come to
   Him. He is ready to heal you now! The sad condition of a blind man
   should always move pity in the breast of the humane, but a glance at
   these two poor men--I do not know that there was anything strange or
   uncommon about their appearance--touched the Savior's sensibility. And
   when He heard them say that they believed He could heal them, He seemed
   to perceive that they had inward sight--and to account it a pity that
   they should not have outward sight too! So at once He put His fingers
   on their eyes, and they received the power of seeing. O Soul, if you
   believe "Christ can save you, and if you will now trust in Him to save
   you, be of good cheer, you are saved! That faith of yours has saved
   you. The very fact that you believe that Jesus is the Christ, and rely
   upon Him, may stand as evidence to you that you are forgiven, that you
   are saved! There is no let or bar to your full redemption! Go your way
   and rejoice in your Lord! He has compassion on you.

   The next case I shall cite is that of the leper, Mark 1:41. This poor
   man was covered with a sad and foul disease when he said to Jesus,
   "Lord, if You will, You can make me clean." He had full faith in
   Christ's ability, but he had some doubts as to Christ's willingness.
   Our Savior looked at him, and though He might very well have rebuked
   him that he should doubt His willingness, He merely said, "I will, be
   you clean," and straightway he was made whole of that loathsome plague!
   If there is in this assembly one grievously defiled or openly disgraced
   by sin, see the leprosy upon yourself and do you say, "I believe He
   could save me if He would"? Have you some lingering doubt about the
   Savior's willingness? Yet I beseech you breathe this prayer, "Lord, I
   believe, I believe Your power. Help You my unbelief which lingers round
   Your willingness." Then little as your faith is, it shall save you!
   Jesus, full of compassion, will pity even your unbelief and accept what
   is faith and forgive what is unbelief. That is a second instance.

   The third I will give you is from Mark 5:19. It was the demoniac. There
   met Christ a man so possessed with a devil as to be mad! And instead of
   belief in Christ or asking for healing, this spirit within the man
   compelled him to say, "Will You torment us before the time?"--and
   rather to stand against Christ healing him than to ask for it. But
   Christ was moved with compassion and He bade the evil spirit come out
   of the evil man. Oh, I am so glad of this instance of His being moved
   with compassion! I do not so much wonder that He has pity on those that
   believe in Him, neither do I so much marvel that He has pity, even, on
   weak faith--but here was a case in which there was no faith, no desire,
   nor anything that could commend him to our Lord's sympathy! Is there no
   such case among the crowds gathered together here? You do not know why
   you have come into this assembly. You scarcely feel at home in this
   place. Though you have led a very sad life, you do not want to be
   converted--not you! You almost shun the thought! Yet it is written, "He
   will have compassion on whom He will have compassion." Well, we have
   known it in this house, and I hope we shall know it again and again
   that the Lord has laid violent hands of love upon unprepared souls!
   They have been struck down with repentance, renewed in heart and saved
   from their sins! Saul of Tarsus had no thought that he would ever be an
   Apostle of Christ, but the Lord stopped the persecutor and changed him
   into a preacher--so that ever afterwards he propagated the faith which
   once he destroyed! May the Lord have compassion on you tonight! Well
   may we offer that prayer, for what will beyour fate if you die as you
   are? What will be your eternal doom if you pass out of this world as
   soon you must, without being sprinkled with the blood of Christ and
   forgiven your iniquities? Jesus knows the terrors of the world to come!
   He describes the torments of Hell. He sees your danger. He warns you.
   He pities you--He sends His messengers to counsel you. He bids me say
   to the very chief of sinners, "Come unto Me, and I will give you rest."
   "Only return unto Me and confess your iniquity, and I will have mercy
   upon you," says the Lord. May God grant that the compassion of Christ
   may be seen in your case!

   As I turned over the Greek Concordance to find out where this word is
   repeated again and again, I found one instance in Luke 7:13. It refers
   to the widow at the gates of Nain. Her son was being carried out--her
   only son. He was dead and she was desolate. The widow's only son was to
   her, her sole stay--the succor as well as the solace of her old age. He
   was dead and laid upon the bier, and when Jesus saw the disconsolate
   mother, He was moved with compassion and He restored her son. Oh, is
   there not refreshment here for you mothers that are weeping for your
   boys? You that have ungodly sons, unconverted daughters, the Lord Jesus
   sees your tears! You weep alone, sometimes, and when you are sitting
   and enjoying the Word, you think, "Oh, that my Absalom were renewed!
   Oh, that Ishmael might live before You." Jesus knows about it. He was
   always tender to His own mother, and He will be so to you. And you that
   are mourning over those that have been lately taken from you, Jesus
   pities you. Jesus wept, He sympathizes with your tears. He will dry
   them and give you consolation. "He was moved with compassion."

   Still the occasions on which we find this expression most frequently
   used in the Evangelists are when crowds of people were assembled. At
   the sight of the great congregations that gathered to hear Him, our
   Lord was often moved with compassion. Sometimes it was because they
   were hungry and faint, and in the fullness of His sympathy, He
   multiplied the loaves and fishes to feed them. At the same time He
   showed His disciples that it is a good work to feed the poor. Jesus
   would not have them so spiritually-minded as to forget that the poor
   have flesh and blood that require susten-ance--and they need to eat and
   to drink, to be housed and clothed--the Christian's charity must not
   lie in words only, but in deeds! Our Lord was moved with compassion, it
   is said, when He saw the number of sick people in the throng, for they
   made a hospital of His preaching place. Wherever He paused or even
   passed by, they laid the sick in the streets! He could not stand or
   walk without the spectacle of their pallets to harrow His feelings. And
   He healed their impotent folk, as if to show that the Christian does
   well to minister to the sick--that the patient watcher by the bedside
   may be serving the Lord and following His example, as well as the most
   diligent teacher or the most earnest preacher of the glorious Gospel!
   All means that can be used to mitigate human suffering are Christ-like,
   and they ought to be carried out in His name, and carried to the utmost
   perfection possible. Christ is the patron of the hospital--He is the
   President of all places where men's bodies are cared for. But we are
   also told that the multitude excited His compassion because they were
   like sheep without a shepherd. So He taught them as a Guide that showed
   the path by leading the way--and He looked after their welfare as a
   Shepherd who regarded the health of their bodies as well as the good
   estate of their souls! Surely, Brothers and Sisters, if you love Him,
   and wish to be like He, you cannot look on this congregation without
   pity. You cannot go out into the streets of London and stand in the
   high roads among the surging masses for half an hour without saying,
   "Where are these souls going? Which road are they travelling? Will they
   all meet in Heaven?" What? You live in London, you move about in this
   great metropolis and do you never have the heartache, never feel your
   soul ready to burst with pity? Then shame on you! Ask yourself whether
   you have the spirit of Christ at all! In this congregation, were we all
   moved with pity as we should be, I should not have to complain, as I
   sometimes must, that persons come in and out of here in need of someone
   to speak with them, to condole, to console, or to commune with them in
   their loneliness, and they find no helper! Time was when such a thing
   never occurred, but, in conversing with enquirers lately, I have met
   with several cases in which persons in a distressed state of mind have
   said that they would have given anything for half an hour's
   conversation with any Christian to whom they might have opened their
   hearts. They came from the country, attended the Tabernacle, and no one
   spoke to them! I am sorry it should be so. You used to watch for souls,
   most of you. Very careful were you to speak to those whom you saw again
   and again. I do pray you mend that matter. If you have a heart of
   mercy, you should be looking out for opportunities to do good! Oh,
   never let a poor wounded soul faint for want of the balm! You know the
   balm. It has healed yourselves. Use it wherever the arrows of God have
   smitten a soul.

   Enough. I must leave this point. I have given you, I think, every case
   in which it is said that Jesus was moved with compassion. Very briefly
   let me notice--

   III. SOME OF THE FORESIGHTS OF HIS COMPASSION.

   The Lord has gone from us, but as He knew what would happen while He
   was away, He has, with blessed forethought, provided for our needs.
   Well, He knew that we should never be able to preserve the Truth of God
   pure by tradition. That is a stream that always muddies and defiles
   everything. So, in tender forethought, He has given us the consolidated
   testimony, the unchangeable Truths of God in His own Book, for He was
   moved with compassion. He knew the priests would not preach the Gospel.
   He knew that no order of men could be trusted to hold fast sound
   Doctrine from generation to generation, He knew there would be
   hirelings that dare not be faithful to their conscience lest they
   should lose their pay--while there would be others who love to tickle
   men's ears and flatter their vanity rather than to tell plainly and
   distinctly the whole counsel of God. Therefore, He has put it here, so
   that if you live where there is no preacher of the Gospel, you have the
   old Book to go to. He is moved with compassion for you. For where a man
   cannot go, the Book can go, and where in silence no voice is heard, the
   still clear voice of this blessed Book can reach the heart. Because He
   knew the people would require this sacred teaching and could not have
   it, otherwise, He was moved with compassion towards us all and gave us
   the blessed Book of Inspired God-breathed Scripture!

   But then, since He knew that some would not read the Bible, and others
   might read and not understand it, He has sent His ministers forth to do
   the work of Evangelists. He raises up men, themselves saved from great
   sin, trophies of redeeming Grace, who feel a sympathy with their fellow
   men who are reveling in sin, reckless of their danger. These servants
   of His, the Lord enables to preach His Truth, some with more, some with
   less ability than others. Still, there are, thank God, throughout this
   happy realm and in other favored lands, men everywhere, who, because
   sinners will not come to Christ of themselves, go after them and
   persuade them, plead with them and entreat them to believe and turn to
   the Lord. This comes of Christ's tender gentleness. He was moved with
   compassion and, therefore, He sent His servants to call sinners to
   repentance.

   But since the minister, though He may call as he may, will not bring
   souls to Christ of himself, the Lord Jesus, moved with compassion, has
   sent His Spirit The Holy Spirit is here. We have not to say--

   "Come Holy Spirit, heavenly dove." He is here! He dwells in His Church
   and He moves over the congregation and He touches men's hearts, and He
   subtly inclines them to believe in Christ. Oh, this is great mercy when
   a Prince spreads a feast and gives an invitation! That is all you can
   expect him to do. But if he keeps a host of footmen and says, "Go and
   fetch them, one by one, till they do come," that is more gracious,
   still! But if He goes Himself and with sacred violence compels them to
   come in--oh, this is more than we could have thought He would have
   done--but He is moved with compassion and He does that! Furthermore,
   Brothers and Sisters, the Lord Jesus knew that after we were saved from
   the damning power of sin, we would always be full of needs and,
   therefore, He was moved with compassion, and He sets up the Throne of
   Grace, the Mercy Seat, to which we may always come, and from which we
   may always obtain Divine Grace to help in time of need. Helped by His
   Spirit, we can bring what petitions we will, and they shall be heard!
   And then, since He knew we could not pray as we ought, He was moved
   with compassion when He sent the Holy Spirit to help our infirmities,
   to teach us how to pray! Now I do not know a single infirmity that I
   have or that you have, my Christian Brothers and Sisters, but what
   Christ Jesus has been moved with compassion about it and has provided
   for it! He has not left one single weak point of which we have to say,
   "There I shall fail, because He will not help there." But He has looked
   us over and over from head to foot, and said, "You will have an
   infirmity there--I will provide for it. You will have a weakness
   there--I will provide for it." And oh, how His promises meet every case
   Did you ever get into a corner where there was not a promise in the
   corner, too? Had you ever to pass through a river but there was a
   promise about His being in the river with you? Were you ever on the
   sick bed without a promise like this, "I will make your bed in your
   sickness"? In the midst of pestilence have you not found a promise
   that, "He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings shall
   you trust"? The Lord's great compassion has met the needs of all His
   servants to the end! If our children should ever need as much patience
   to be exercised towards them as Christ needs to exercise towards us, I
   am sure there would be none of us able to bear the house. They have
   their infirmities and they full often vex and grieve us, it may be, but
   oh, we ought to have much compassion for the infirmities of our
   children--yes, and of our Brothers and Sisters, and neighbors--for what
   compassion has the Lord had with us? I do believe none but God could
   bear with such unruly children as we ourselves are. He sees our faults,
   you know, when we do not see them, and He knows what those faults are
   more thoroughly than we do. Yet, still, He never smites in anger. He
   cuts us not off, but He still continues to show us abounding mercies!
   Oh, what a Guardian Savior is the Lord Jesus Christ to us, and how we
   ought to bless His name at all times, and how His praise should be
   continually in our mouth. One thought strikes me that I must put in
   here--He knew that we should be very forgetful--and He was moved with
   compassion with our forgetfulness when He instituted the blessed
   Supper, and we can sit around the Table and break bread, and pour forth
   the wine in remembrance of Him. Surely this is another instance of how
   He is moved with compassion--not with indignation towards our
   weaknesses! And now let me close with--

   IV. PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF THE COMPASSION OF CHRIST.

   I shall only recall my own experience in order to stir up your pure
   minds, by way of remembrance, my Brothers and Sisters. I do well
   remember when I was under conviction of sinand smarted bitterly under
   the rod of God--that when I was most heavy and depressed, there would
   sometimes come something like hope across my spirit. I knew what it was
   to say, "My soul chooses strangling rather than life," yet when I was
   at the lowest ebb and most ready to despair, though I could not quite
   lay hold of Christ, I used to get a touch of the promise, now and then,
   till I half hoped that, after all, I might prove to be God's prisoner
   and He might yet set me free! I do remember well, when my sins
   compassed me about like bees, and I thought it was all over with me,
   and I must be destroyed by them, it was at that moment when Jesus
   revealed Himself to me. Had He waited a little longer, I had died of
   despair, but that was no desire of His! On swift wings of love He came
   and manifested His dear wounded Self to my heart. I looked to Him and
   was lightened, and my peace flowed like a river! I rejoiced in Him!
   Yes, He was moved with compassion. He would not let the pangs of
   conviction be too severe--neither would He allow them to be protracted
   so long for the spirit of man to fail before Him. It is not His
   practice to break a leaf that is driven by the tempest. "He will not
   quench the smoking flax." Yes, and I remember since I first saw Him and
   began to love Him, many sharp and severe troubles, dark and heavy
   trials, yet have I noted this, that they have never reached that pitch
   of severity which I was unable to bear. When all gates seemed closed,
   there has still been with the trial, a way of escape, and I have noted
   again that in deeper depressions of spirits through which I have
   passed, and horrible despondencies that have crushed me down, I have
   had some gleams of love, and hope, and faith at that last moment, for
   He was moved with compassion! If He withdrew His face, it was only till
   my heart broke for Him, and then He showed me the light of His
   Countenance again. If He laid the rod upon me, yet when my soul cried
   under His chastening, He could not bear it, but He put back the rod and
   He said, "My child, I will comfort you." Oh, the comforts that He gives
   on a sick bed! Oh, the consolations of Christ when you are very low! If
   there is anything dainty to the taste in the Word of God, you get it
   then! If there are any hearts of mercy, you hear them sounding for you
   then. When you are in the saddest plight, Christ comes to your aid with
   the sweetest manifestations, for He is moved with compassion!

   How frequently have I noticed, and I tell it to His praise, for though
   it shows my weakness, it proves His compassion, that sometimes, after
   preaching the Gospel, I have been so filled with self-reproach that I
   could hardly sleep through the night because I had not preached as I
   desired. I have sat down and cried over some sermons, as though I knew
   that I had missed the mark and lost the opportunity. Not once nor
   twice, but many a time has it happened, that within a few days someone
   has come to tell me that he or she found the Lord through that very
   sermon, the shortcoming of which I had deplored! Glory be to Jesus--it
   was His gentleness that did it! He did not want His servant to be too
   much bowed down with a sense of infirmity, and so He had compassion on
   him and comforted him! Have not you noticed, some of you, that after
   doing your best to serve the Lord, when somebody has sneered at you, or
   you have met with such a rebuff as made you half-inclined to give up
   the work, an unexpected success has been given you, so that you have
   not played the Jonah and ran away to Tarshish, but kept to your work?
   Ah, how many times in your life, if you could read it all, you would
   have to stop and write between the lines, "He was moved with
   compassion." Many and many a time, when no other compassion could help,
   when all the sympathy of friends would be unavailing, He has been moved
   with compassion towards us, has said to us, "Be of good cheer,"
   banished our fears with the magic of His voice and filled our souls to
   overflowing with gratitude! When we have been misrepresented, maligned
   and slandered, we have found in the sympathy of Christ our richest
   support, till we could sing with rapture the verse I cannot help
   quoting, now, though I have often quoted it before--

   "If on my face for Your dear name, Shame and reproach shall be, I'll
   hail reproach and welcome shame, Since You remember me."

   The compassion of the Master making up for all the abuses of His
   enemies! And, believe me, there is nothing sweeter to a forlorn and
   broken spirit than the fact that Jesus has compassion. Are any of you
   sad and lonely? Have any of you been cruelly wronged? Have you lost the
   goodwill of some you esteemed? Do you seem as if you had the cold
   shoulder even from good people? Do not say, in the anguish of your
   spirit, "I am lost," and give up. He has compassion on you! No, poor
   fallen woman, seek not the dark river and the cold stream--He has
   compassion! He who looks down with the bright eyes of yonder stars and
   watches you is your Friend! He yet can help you! Though you have gone
   so far from the path of virtue, throw not yourself away in blank
   despair, for He has compassion! And you, broken down in health and
   broken down in fortune, scarcely with shoes for your feet, you are
   welcome in the House of God, welcome as the most honored guest in the
   assembly of the saints! Let not the weighty grief that hangs over your
   soul tempt you to think that hopelessness and darkness have settled
   your fate and foreclosed your doom! Though your sin may have beggared
   you, Christ can enrich you with better riches. He has compassion! "Ah,"
   you say, "they will pass me on the stairs. They will give me a broad
   pathway and if they see me in the street they will not speak to
   me--even His disciples will not." Be it so, but better than His
   disciples, more tender by far, is Jesus! Is there a man here whom to
   associate with were a scandal from which the pure and pious would
   shrink? The holy, harmless, undefiled One will not disdain even
   him--for this man receives sinners--He is a friend of publicans and
   sinners! He is never happier than when He is relieving and retrieving
   the forlorn, the abject and the outcast! He despises not any that
   confess their sins and seek His mercy. No pride nestles in His dear
   heart, no sarcastic word rolls off His gracious tongue, no bitter
   expression falls from His blessed lips. He still receives the guilty.
   Pray to Him now! Now let the silent prayer go up, "My Savior, have pity
   upon me! Be moved with compassion towards me, for if misery is any
   qualification for mercy, I am a fit object for Your compassion. Oh,
   save me for Your mercy's sake!" Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW9:27-38.

   Verses 27, 28. And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men
   followed Him, crying and saying, Son of David,have mercy on us. And
   when He was come into the house.I suppose the house at Capernaum, where
   he was known to stay.

   28. The blind men came to Him.Forced their way in. They must be
   attended to. Hunger breaks through stone walls, they say, and an
   earnest heart will follow after what it seeks.

   28, 29. And Jesus said unto them, Believe you that I am able to do
   this? They said unto Him, Yes, Lord. Then He touched their eyes,
   saying, According to your faith, be it unto you. That is, "If you do
   not believe, you shall not see, but if there is faith in you, behold,
   you shall have sight."

   30-32. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus at once charged them,
   saying, See that no man knows it But they, when they were departed,
   spread abroad His fame in all that country. As they went out, behold,
   they brought to Him a dumb man posessed with a devil.Here we have had
   the dead, those that were bleeding to death, the blind and the dumb,
   and the possessed of a devil.

   33. And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spoke. And the multitudes
   marveled, saying, it was never so seen in Israel No, but Jesus does
   wonders! Something off the common, and altogether out of the ordinary
   way, His work of Grace must be!

   34. But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the Prince of
   the devils. There is always somebody or other who has got an ugly word
   to put in. It matters not how much God may bless the Gospel, there is
   no stopping the sneers and objections--but the mercy is that it does
   not matter much. Our Lord was not hurt and the work went on,
   notwithstanding all the quibbling of the Pharisees.

   35. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
   synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every
   sickness and every disease among the people. That was the answer to the
   Pharisees. Christian activity and fervent devotion to the cause of God
   is the best answer that can be given to quibblers of any sort or every
   sort! In your work hold on, my Brother, and those who quibble at you,
   now, may come to honor you one of these days.

   36-37. But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for
   them because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having
   no shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is
   plenteous, but the laborers are few.We are all loiterers, but where are
   the laborers? Where are they with the sharp sickle that can cut down
   the wheat and, with a ready hand, can bind it and, with a strong
   shoulder, carry it? Alas, in this great city the harvest is truly
   plenteous, but the laborers are few!

   38. Pray you, therefore, the Lord of the Harvest, that He will send
   forth laborers into His harvest.

Man Transient--god's Word Eternal

   (No. 3439)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1914.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 26, 1868.

   "The grass withers, the flower fades; but the Word of our God stands
   forever." Isaiah 40:8.

   A FEW thoughts, first, upon the things that wither. Then a word or two
   upon that word which endures. And then the lessons which the contrast
   will suggest. I. THE THINGS WHICH WITHER.

   The things which wither--grass and its flower; man and all that comes
   of man; the creature and all that springs from the creature. We are apt
   to think man a long-lived creature, and as we look upon races and
   nations, we regard the history of mankind as though it were of
   considerable length. If we could form any idea of eternity, we should
   ridicule ourselves for thinking a thousand years or six thousand years
   to be anything at all. They are but as a watch in the night in
   comparison with the endless ages of the life of God! They are no sooner
   come than they have gone! We look upon the grass as a short-lived
   thing, and talk about the frailty as well as the loveliness of the
   flowers--but is there so great a difference? They have their
   seasons--we have ours--and the seasons differ not so much after all.
   What if they last a month, and we last 70 years? Yet when both are
   withered, what does it signify? He that died but yesterday is as much
   dead as he that died a thousand years ago! And when the season is over,
   it comes to pretty much the same thing, whether we count that season by
   years or count it by hours. After all, the short-lived thing and we are
   cousins--and, looked at in the light of eternity, we and the insects
   are things which are and are not, floating for a while in the sunbeam,
   and then are gone from the land of the living. The voice that cried in
   the wilderness warned all mankind of that familiar truth, that all men,
   being but flesh, will as surely pass away as all the grass! Grass,
   being but grass, will surely, in its season, come to the scythe, or
   wither where it stands!

   But the meaning of the text, as opened by the context, is not only that
   man is frail and must die, but that everything connected with man is
   so--everything that man can do, all his surroundings, especially
   everything in which man glories, as the grass may glory in its
   flower--everything of which man boasts about, which he measures and
   esteems himself, shall also pass away. And I shall remind you of this,
   dear Friends, that if you are rejoicing in anything which belongs to
   time and sense, you may decrease what the poet calls, "this brainless
   ardor," and may set your affections upon something more worthy of an
   immortal spirit! Remember that all the hopes of man that have to do
   with man are but as the flower of grass.

   You are setting your hopes, perhaps, upon that dear boy when he shall
   have grown up and come to maturity. What a comfort and a stay he will
   be! Or your hope is resting upon that speculation which you trust will
   turn out successfully, or more solidly, perhaps, upon the gains of
   perseverance which, if slow, are sure. Set not your hopes on any of
   these things, for if you do, they may end in disappointment as you
   grasp them, like the apples of Sodom, which are fair to look upon, but
   which turn to ashes in the mouth! These hopes may be eggs that never
   shall be hatched, phantoms that have no reality in them. If your hopes
   are fixed on God's Word--the Word that endures--be as optimistic as you
   will, for you shall never be deceived! But if your hopes are
   earth-born, hear the cry of the Prophet--"All flesh is grass, and all
   the goodliness thereof as the flower of the field"--your hope will
   wither as flowers do.

   Equally so will it be with the joys you have already attained. It may
   not be altogether hoping with you. You have passed the early morning of
   life and you have realized something. You are content and that is to be
   rich. You are thankful that God has smiled upon you in Providence and
   that He has blessed you in many respects. Yes, but still even
   contentment may be a sin if it is an earthly contentment which checks
   your aspirations for the skies. If you are content enough to say with
   the rich man, "Soul, take your ease, you have much goods laid up for
   many years," then remember that of all the attainments of this world,
   by way of pleasure, satisfaction and wealth, it may be said, "The
   goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field." You will die and
   leave these things--and then what pleasure will you have in your
   garden, in your home, your well-stored chambers and your money? What
   can all yield you when your eyes shall be glazed in death? Or, before
   you depart from them, these things may depart from you, for riches have
   wings and oftentimes but one clap of the hand of Providence and all
   these birds have flown to nests somewhere else!

   But if this is true of common hopes and ordinary attainments, you must
   not think it is not true of higher matters, for in these it is equally
   the case. Suppose we have been seeking after mental acquisitions, have
   been great students, have read many books, have tried to be learned?
   Now, there is something in this far more elevating than in seeking to
   gather together so many coins of the realm, but still, all the learning
   that comes of man and that comes in man, is but as the flower of the
   field that withers! You shall find, Friends, that, "much study is a
   weariness of the flesh, and he that increases knowledge increases
   sorrow unto himself." The more you know, the more you shall discover of
   your own ignorance-- and as you attain unto what you think to be the
   light, you shall find the very excess of light causes you a greater
   sense of the surrounding darkness! And when you come to die, if you
   have neglected the knowledge of God, how will it avail you to have
   measured the stars, to have counted those mighty orbs, to have fathomed
   the depths of oceans, or have soared the heights of the hills? Where
   are all the philosophies of the man in Hell? Where is all the wisdom of
   yon corpse that slumbers in the sepulcher, while the spirit is driven
   from the Presence of God? All such comeliness is but as a withered
   flower.

   Perhaps, however, you are accumulating around you love, which is the
   richest of treasures, and the best of wisdom. You are living in the
   affections of your household, and you are grateful to do so--and I
   honor you for having thought it better to win the love of others than
   to selfishly amass anything to yourself. But yet, dear Friend, remember
   that even this must go! There is not a child in the household that is
   immortal. The fondest object of your affections must certainly, before
   long, succumb beneath the arrows of death. Insatiable Archer! You carry
   many arrows and you spare no human hearts! All of woman born must be
   targets for your shafts! Set not, then, your heart's choice, to be
   chief affections on those dear ones here, but upon another Husband,
   another Father, another Brother, another Friend! Let these aspirations
   of your heart become Immortal, lest in the bitterness of your spirit,
   you find of all these that "the flower thereof fades away."

   Going a step higher, there is a kind of spiritual life, so called,
   which is not of God, and even this, coming entirely of man, is just as
   fading as everything else that is human. Beloved, if you and I should
   seek to obtain a righteousness by exact obedience to the Law of God, by
   patience under suffering, by zeal in the service of our Master--if we
   were to be successful in this righteousness and, year after year, by
   consistency of character and excellence of conduct, should win the
   esteem of our fellow men and deserve it, yet, mark you--even that
   righteousness, if not worked in us by the Holy Spirit, but only the
   fruit of our own resolution, would be only as the flower of grass, and
   in due time it would wither away! Do you remember when your
   righteousness did wither? Some of us will never forget when ours did.
   We prided ourselves much. We supposed--and we were probably not wrong
   in the supposition--that we were about as good as our neighbors, and we
   were satisfied with this belief. Indeed, we had some degree of
   generosity, good feeling and good desire towards God, of a sort, and in
   all this we wrapped ourselves up and we said, "Surely this will
   suffice! I may safely venture into eternity with such a preparation as
   this!" But oh, when the Sun of Righteousness began to shine into our
   souls, though He brought healing under His wings to everything that was
   good within us, He brought death to all this proud righteousness of
   ours! And how it began to droop, decay and wither--just like a lily
   that is snapped when the heat of the sun begins to pour on it. Surely,
   Brothers and Sisters, the best that man can do for himself, with all
   his diligence and all his care, is but as a fading flower! And when he
   sits himself down at ease in his contentment and says, "I shall see no
   sorrow. I have served my Maker. I thank God that I am not as other
   men," even then is he naked, and poor and blind and miserable--a
   blighted, blasted, withered flower, though he thinks "himself to be as
   a rose of Sharon, or a lily of the valley."

   So, Brothers and Sisters, it is equally true of everything in the child
   of God that does not come from God. Not only is our own righteousness a
   conceit of righteousness, but all our attainments in the Divine life
   which are made in our own strength will all wither. Oh, what holy
   frames of mind we sometimes think we have, and how we are getting on in
   spirituality! We half believe in attaining to perfection--we mean to
   get to within an inch or two of it, at any rate. We think the old Adam
   is dead, and if the devil is not dead, yet we think, at any rate, he is
   busy somewhere else and he is going to leave us alone. If we are not
   quite past temptation, yet we think we are such experienced Christians
   that if temptation shall come, we shall be aware of Satan's devices and
   be able to escape. But in a moment all this melts away. Some new
   temptation comes, we are smitten in a place for which we are not
   provided with any armor--we are wounded and fall down. Oh, the quantity
   of confectionery sanctification that some of us have made--such gilt
   gingerbread confectionery, all molded into the most delicate shapes,
   but somehow or other the stand on which we place these things slips
   aside and there is such a breaking! There is discovered such foulness
   and abomination lurking within our hearts that we could not have
   believed that we could have been such as we turn out to be! We would
   have said, if we had been told, "Is your servant a dog that he should
   do this thing?"--but such dogs we, after all, turn out to be! Brothers
   and Sisters, I am afraid of my good frames! I am afraid of my graces! I
   am afraid of anything that I begin to think is good in myself, for
   although sins are dangerous and to be abhorred, yet we generally know
   what they are, and we watch against them, but under the cover of that
   which is supposed to be good and excellent, pride creeps in, as does
   self-sufficiency and carnal security, and so we get many a deadly stab!
   Believer, remember when you work yourself up into devotedness, when you
   think you have got a Divine Grace and have not got it, but have only
   got that which you gave yourself--this is but the flower of the grass
   and it will wither--it cannot stand.

   So do I believe it is in all religious exercises. Everything which is
   got up and worked for by man always comes to an end. Those excitements
   which some delight in, I do not think come of the Spirit of God. At
   least they may come of His work as much as the dust in the road has to
   do with the progress of a carriage. It is a nuisance that somehow or
   other is tied to a good thing, but the excitement some people seem to
   think is the progress, is just as the fly, as he sat on the carriage,
   thought that he made it roll along the road. But it is not so! It is
   not so at all! How many churches have been revived into perpetual
   barrenness! The bladder has been blown till it burst. There has been a
   pumping and a heaving, and a trusting in the artificial, instead of
   waiting quietly upon God. People have been driven pretty nearly mad,
   and this has been thought to be spirituality and the work of the Grace
   of God! Brother and Sisters, it is only the flower of grass--a very
   pretty flower--oftentimes a most tempting and fascinating flower--but
   it will all fail, for nothing will stand but the work of the Holy
   Spirit! Nothing will endure even the test of time, but the Spirit's own
   work upon the heart and conscience! Anything that comes of man, and not
   of God, will as surely disappear as the smoke of the chimney when the
   wind blows it away, or as the hoar frost of the morning when the sun
   has fully risen with his fervent heat. Take this, then, as the first
   Truth of God, that everything in us, or which we glory in, or trust to,
   or rejoice in, will as certainly pass away as does the grass from the
   field and the flower which springs of it. But now, in the second place,
   we have a much more comfortable subject of reflection in the next
   sentence--

   II. THE WORD THAT ENDURES.

   "But the Word of our God stands forever." What "Word" is this? I think
   the term applies to the Word of God in five different ways. First, it
   is the Word of His purpose. The Word of our God. Has He said it and
   shall He not do it? Has He purposed and shall it not come to pass? God
   has, from all eternity, a wondrous plan by which He will manifest all
   His attributes in the salvation of His people. Now from His plan He
   will never vary, and in the details of it He will never change.
   Whatever He has decreed shall most certainly come to pass! And as for
   the salvation of His elect, all the powers of evil, both of earth and
   Hell, shall never be able to thwart the Eternal Mind as to the
   salvation of any of those whom He has predestinated unto eternal life.
   We do not find ministers often preaching about this Eternal Purpose,
   but we do find the Apostle Paul often writing about it. And the saints
   of old were accustomed to dwell upon it with very much delight. Oh,
   beloved Friends, there is a purpose concerning His people, even their
   eternal salvation--and that purpose will as surely be fulfilled as God
   is God--yes, though before conversion they plunge into sin! Yes, and
   though during their conversion they resist the Spirit of God! Yes, and
   though after conversion they go astray like lost sheep, yet shall the
   ous power of Sovereign Grace is more than a match for the waywardness
   of nature--and the will of God shall sweetly lead in Divine captivity
   the will of man, and though the man resolves on his own
   destruction--God, who ordains salvation, shall accomplish His own
   purpose, earth and Hell notwithstanding! Oh, precious Truth of God, on
   which the child of God may fall back in his darkest moments! The grass
   withers, but the Word of the Divine Purpose stands forever!

   This "Word" also refers to His Word of promise. Every Word which God
   has spoken to His people by way of promise is as true today as when it
   was first uttered by the Prophet who was originally sent with it. And
   if this world should exist through tens of thousands of years, every
   promise will still have the raven locks of its youth about it. No
   promise will grow stale! No Word of God will cease to be of effect. It
   may have been fulfilled ten thousand times ten thousand times, but it
   will still be fulfilled. The promise shall be forever a well flowing
   for thirsty souls to drink of. It shall be a granary forever stored for
   the hunger of the Lord's people to be supplied from. What a mercy it is
   for us that the promise cannot be made to fail! Though we believe not,
   yet He abides faithful. Heaven and earth may pass away, but not a jot
   or tittle of the promise shall fail--

   "His every Word of Grace is strong, As that which built the skies-- The
   voice that rolls the stars along, Spoke all the promises."

   The Words spoken to Nature by God when He bade seedtime and harvest,
   summer and winter, never cease, have all been kept! The promise that
   the rainbow should be seen in the cloud in the day of rain has not been
   forgotten--nor shall any one of the promises of the Covenant ordered in
   all things and sure be forgotten by the God of Grace! Oh, Christian,
   how you may go, tonight, to your Bible and read out the promise and
   find it as new to you and as true to you as if an angel came from
   Heaven to bring it in fresh language from the Divine Throne! You have
   lost your child. Your husband is gone. Your property has melted. Your
   health declines. You draw near to death, but the promise, the promise
   is still yours, "No good thing will He withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." "I will never leave you nor forsake you." "As your days so
   shall your strength be." "I am God, I change not; therefore, you sons
   of Jacob are not consumed." The Words of purpose and the Words of
   promise stand forever!

   So, Brothers and Sisters, especially is it with the Incarnate Word. We
   are in the habit of calling the Bible, "the Word of God." I suppose
   that is accurate enough, but the Word of God is not the Bible--it is
   Jesus Christ. His name shall be called, "The Word of God." "In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God." Well now, of this Incarnate Word, this Everlasting Logos, we may
   say that He stands forever. "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today
   and forever." When I, a trembling sinner, went to the great High Priest
   and looked up to Him who wore the miter and the many-jeweled
   breastplate, looked up to His wounds, saw the blood marks, trusted Him,
   fell at His feet and heard Him say, "I have blotted out your sins like
   a cloud, and like a thick cloud your iniquities," how dear He was to my
   soul that day, how fairer than the sons of men! And this day, though
   years have passed since then, He is the same, and to Him I may come
   again, tonight, as I did then, and find that He has still the fountain
   filled with blood and that its efficacy has in no degree been
   diminished! And so, should I live till gray old age, I shall find that
   He abides still the same. That precious blood of His--

   "Shall never lose its power,

   Till all the ransomed Church of God,

   Is saved to sin no more."

   Oh, to have a faithful, an unchanging Friend, one that never
   departs--this is comfort, indeed, regardless of what trouble may come.
   The Word of our God, Christ Jesus, stands forever!

   The fourth signification of the term must be surely the Word of the
   Gospel--the Word of Gospel Truth which we preach, for so says the
   Apostle as he quotes this passage, "This is the Word which by the
   Gospel is preached unto you." That Word stands forever! Brothers and
   Sisters, the old Gospel of the Apostles is the Gospel of today! There
   has been a notion abroad about discoveries in theology, but recollect
   that everything that is new in preaching is not true--and everything
   that is true is not new! We may say, concerning the preaching of the
   Gospel, "The old is better." Let us keep to the good old ways. You will
   never advance upon Peter and Paul! If you do, you will have to go back
   again. All the advances there are, are but running on a fool's errand,
   running before the clouds, running beyond the Wisdom of God-- and he
   who is wise beyond what is written will only find himself landed in
   folly. The Gospel was to have been disproved years ago, according to
   the notion of some. Modern discoveries were to have proved this, that,
   and the other to have been all a mistake, and we were to have given up
   this dogma as being a delusion and that other teaching as being a
   superstition! But it is not so. The Gospel has gone through the furnace
   and come out like silver, well refined! The Gospel of Jesus Christ has
   not lost one iota of its glory and perfection. There is not a Doctrine
   that has been disproved--not one of her

   Truths has been broken, nor so much as one single pillar of the house
   been shaken, nor shall it be! There may be atheists and deists,
   philosophers and skeptics, but when they have done their best, or done
   their worst, the Gospel shall bestir itself, like Samson, when he had
   been bound with green withes, and shall snap all their cords and send
   the Philistines in confusion, flying here and there! Believe in the
   power of the Gospel, dear Christian Friends, and never be afraid. Do
   not believe in the wisdom of those who are wiser than God, and do not
   tremble at all their boasts. Many men open their mouths widest when
   they have nothing to say, and so may it be with these. They would not
   brag and boast so much if they felt secure, but feeling that they have
   not touched the vitality of our religion, they do but rage and rave.

   And fifthly, this term, "The Word of our God" refers to the inner
   spiritual life of the Christian, for remember, you are quickened by the
   incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever--and that
   incorruptible Seed is said to be the Word of God. Now, all other seed
   throughout the world, and that which comes from a mortal source, dies,
   but the Seed of the Divine Truth, dropped by the Holy Spirit in the
   heart, is incorruptible and, therefore, it lives and abides forever!
   What a blessing it is to get the Word of God into the heart, because if
   God puts it in, none but God can take it out again. If you get a word
   into your heart from the lip of one man, the lip of another man may
   drive it out, but if you get living Truth burned into your soul by God,
   the Holy Spirit, Himself, then you may defy the devil himself to remove
   the glorious work! Oh, Beloved, remember the Words of Jesus, "The water
   that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto
   everlasting life." "He that lives and believes in Me," says Christ,
   "though he were dead, yet shall he live." We do not find our Master
   speaking of this new life decaying, or of the fountain which He puts
   into the soul drying up, but He says, "Out of him shall flow rivers of
   living water." And, "I give unto My sheep, eternal life, and they shall
   never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." Men may
   die, but Christians shall not--I mean the natural life expires but the
   celestial life never dies! Death does not affect the principle which
   God implants at Regeneration. No, it sets free that principle. It
   delivers it from the bondage of flesh and blood, from the slavery of
   corruption and introduces it into liberty, into a region where it can
   expand and develop, and come to all its glorious perfection! The grass
   withers, the flower thereof fades away, but the enduring Word of our
   God neither withers nor fades, but stands fast forever! And now, to
   close--

   III. WHAT ARE THE LESSONS WHICH THIS STRONG CONTRAST OUGHT TO TEACH US?

   Everything of the creature dying, everything of the Creator living,
   everything of man withering, everything of God blooming in eternal
   youth--what should this say to us? Why, it should say to us, first--
   Weave not a chaplet of flowers that shall surely fade for your brow! Do
   you seek fame? Let it be the fame that comes from God! Do you seek
   wealth? Let it be a wealth that will be current in the skies. Do you
   seek love? Let it be a love which will exist where they marry not,
   neither are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God. Flowers?
   Yes, if you will, but gather them in Paradise. Garlands? Yes, if you
   please, but let them be woven in the King's own gardens, in that land
   where--

   "Everlasting spring abides, And never withering flowers." You are an
   immortal, trade for immortality! You shall never die, Christian--there
   is a new life within you--you shall exist forever! Equal with the life
   of God shall be your life. Oh, then, be not gathering trifles--things
   that melt. Let not your life be as a miser's dream, who dreams he
   gathers gold and wakes and it is gone. Be not like that foolish Roman
   Emperor who took his troops to Britain, landed them in full State, bade
   every man gather a handful of shells and then go back to Rome with
   great triumph! He had taken Britain, he said--here were the shells from
   the shore. Oh, never say, "I have conquered life--here is the money! I
   can say I have lived grandly--here is honor!" Oh, these things are but
   the broken shells upon the shore. Seek jewels and pearls that shall be
   jewels and pearls before God, that shall be looked upon by Him as being
   precious because they last and continue in eternity. Dear Hearer, seek
   your soul'swealth. Seek to have your sins forgiven. Seek to wrap your
   soul in the righteousness of Christ--that garment which the moth cannot
   fret! Seek to be one with Jesus! There is nothing beneath the stars
   worth having if you have not these things! Trust in Him. All else shall
   be like a bubble on a wave and melt and fly before you, if you have not
   confidence in Jesus! There stands the first lesson. Since all of earth
   shall melt and fade away, build not your house with these shadows, but
   with substantial timbers and hewn stones that shall stand through the
   lapse of ages and last into eternity.

   Another lesson. If you are on God's side, never be afraid of the
   mightiest opponent. What are they? What are they? Grass! Where is the
   mower? Then he comes, there is an end of them. And what are their
   boasts, and what are their railings? The flower of grass! Here comes a
   breeze--the sharp breath of winter, and they are gone! Some people are
   always afraid of the Pope, and some are dreadfully alarmed at Puseyism,
   some are shocked at the Broad Church movement. I do not know where we
   are not going to, Brother and Sisters, according to the accounts we are
   daily receiving from those who ought to know! We are in a dreadfully
   bad way and it seems that the Church of God is going to be broken up,
   sold for old timber, and put an end to! And there will be burnings in
   Smithfield again, and I do not know what besides! Ah, the Lord knows
   how to take care of His Church without the help of some of those
   gentlemen who are so very earnest in taking care of it just lately, and
   I am pretty sure that if He could not take care of it without them, He
   won't do much at it with them! But his Truth of God will never shake
   nor be moved, come what may! You never need be alarmed. If all the
   kings, and emperors, and cardinals, and popes, and priests, and great
   men and mighty men, and merchants, and mobs, and crowds should rise
   against the Lord's Truth and against the Lord's Anointed, what would it
   matter? Who are you that you should be afraid of a man that shall die,
   and the son of man that is but a worm? The grass in the field--why, let
   it boast! What cares the King with His army about the grass? "Why," He
   says, "the steeds of My cavalry shall eat the grass! It shall soon be
   gone." So God shall overthrow all their show of strength! In an hour,
   if so God willed it, He could convert the world! In a single hour, if
   so it pleased Him, dominant superstitions would be relinquished, and
   the old systems of idolatry would totter to their fall. Never think of
   the Church of God as if she were in danger. If you do, you will be like
   Uzza--you will put forth your hand to steady the Ark and provoke the
   Lord to anger against you! If it were in danger, I tell you, you could
   not deliver it! If Christ cannot take care of His Church without you,
   you cannot do it. Be still, and know that He is God.

   Who am I that I should begin to agitate myself about the safety of the
   Empire of France and should go to Napoleon and should tell him that I
   was afraid the empire was insecure, and I was come to help him manage
   the Government? I think I should be sent back about my business. And
   so, surely, when you begin to say, "The Church is in danger! The Church
   is in danger!" what is that to you? It stood before you were born--it
   will stand when you have become worm's meat! Do your duty. Keep in the
   path of obedience, and fear not. He who made the Church knew through
   what trials she would have to pass, and He made her so that she can
   endure the trials and become the richer for it. The enemy is but grass,
   the Word of the Lord endures forever!

   And so, Beloved, take heed, let each of us take heed that we keep to
   the enduring Truth of God. Never let us be tempted by the flash of
   novelty, or by the attractions of supposed intelligence, to turn aside
   from the Word of God. "To the Law and the Testimony: if they speak not
   according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them." If
   our creed is partly made up of the Word of God, partly of the
   traditions of the Fathers, partly of the speculations of thinkers, it
   will be like Nebuchadnezzar's image--part of gold, part of iron and
   part of clay--and the clay will fly and the iron will be melted. But if
   we can get a creed that is made up, as far as our poor fallible
   judgments can enable us, altogether of the Word of God, then we have a
   creed that we can take with us into eternity! The Word of the Lord
   endures forever. How I like to get my own thoughts and beliefs put
   through the fire every now and then. I do not think there is a single
   Doctrine that I have not doubted. I am happy to have to say that now,
   painful as the process was. It has been such a blessed thing to have to
   go to the bottom of it, to get arguments for it, to dig up and see
   whether the roots were sound and healthy, and oh, what a deal of what
   we think we know goes to the dogs in the hour of trial! But that which
   comes to us through the Word, and concerning which we can give a, "Thus
   says the Lord," that, and only that, will stand with an honest man who
   subjects himself to a daily examination--and asks the Holy Spirit, like
   a refiner's fire, to go through and through his soul! I fear there are
   many who could not abide the day of the coming of this work into their
   hearts. It acts like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap. It burns
   up a thousand fancies! It washes away I do not know what of
   predilection and of prejudice. It might induce some here to give up
   some of their most cherished things! It might involve a solemn
   sacrifice for the future, but I beseech them to do it. Side not with
   the grass that must wither, for you must wither with it if you take it
   for your defense. But keep to this grand old Book! Keep the Word of
   God, for this shall neither wither, nor shall you, if you abide in the
   living Spirit of God hard and fast by what this Word teaches you.

   God grant us this, and His be the praise forever. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM119:153-174.

   Verse 153. Consider my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget
   Your Law. As much as if he said, "Lord, I do not forget You--do not
   forget me." Your Grace has kept my memory--let your Grace keep me
   altogether.

   154-56. Plead my cause and deliver me: quicken me according to Your
   word. Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not Your
   statutes. Great are Your tender mercies, O LORD, quicken me according
   to Your judgments. Oh, how the saints need quickening. They know they
   do! They feel that they get dull, and they cannot endure it--they are
   not happy unless they possess vivid Grace and true light!

   157-58 Many are my persecutors and my enemies: yet do I not decline
   from Your testimonies. Ibeheld the transgressors, and was grieved;
   because they kept not Your Word. The very sight of them gave me sorrow.
   Even though they tried to be mirthful, I was not amused by them, and
   beheld them and was grieved, "Because they kept not Your Word."

   159. Consider how I love Your precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according
   to Your loving kindness. My heart is right, I do love You, but I feel
   dull and heavy. Lord, come and quicken me, not according to my love to
   You, but according to Your loving kindness, come and quicken me. "Your
   Word is true from the beginning"--from the first page of the Book of
   Genesis to the very last--true about everything, true from the first
   moment it began with me! Every promise has been kept. There has not
   been a falsehood all the way through.

   160. Your Word is true from the beginning: and everyone of your
   righteous judgments endures forever. "Princes have persecuted me
   without a cause." David was a prince--and a man expects to be fairly
   dealt with by his peers--but it was not so in his case.

   161. Princes have persecutedme without a cause: but my heart stands in
   awe ofYour Word. When we are in awe of God's Word, we shall not be in
   awe of princes. The fear of God is the best cure for the fear of men.

   162. I rejoice at Your Word, as one that finds great spoil He had more
   joy in reading the Scriptures than in winning a great battle, or in
   being surprised at the finding of a great treasure!

   163. I hate and abhor lying: but Your Law do I love. Now the Orientals
   did not hate lying--they generally tried to be proficient at it. The
   only fault about lying with them is to be discovered--then they think
   they must have been very unskillful. David, therefore, was far ahead of
   his time--far ahead of his fellow countrymen.

   164. Seven times a day do I praise You because of Your righteous
   judgments. He could not have enough of praise! He did it often, he did
   it perfectly--seven times a day--and if he praised God seven times a
   day because of His righteous judgments, how much more ought we to do it
   because of His abounding Grace! Ah, there is a special cause for
   thanks.

   165-66. Great peace have they which love Your Law: and nothing shall
   offend them. LORD, I have hoped for Your salvation, and done Your
   commandments.Two good things to put together--hope in God's mercy and
   obedience to God's will.

   168-174. My soul has kept Your testimonies; and I love them
   exceedingly. I have kept Your precepts and Your testimonies: for all my
   ways are before You. Let my cry come near before You, O LORD: give me
   understanding according to Your Word. Let my supplication come before
   You: deliver me according to Your Word. My lips shall utter praise when
   You have taught me Your statutes. My tongue shall speak of Your word:
   for all Your commandments are righteousness. Let Your hand help me, for
   I have chosen Your precepts. I have longed for Your salvation, O LORD,
   and Your Law is my delight. Cannot we say that, dear Friends, this
   evening? I hope we can--with all our failings and wandering, yet the
   Law of God is our delight--and if we could have our wish, we would
   never again go beyond its restraints, nor fall short of its demands!
