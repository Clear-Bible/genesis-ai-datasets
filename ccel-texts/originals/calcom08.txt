   INTRODUCTORY NOTICE

   The Book Of Psalms, viewed merely as a poetical composition, has very
   high claims on our attention. Men of the most refined and cultivated
   taste have often been attracted to the study of it from the poetical
   beauties with which it abounds, and have admitted, in this respect, the
   superiority of its claims. The greatest of our English poets [1] thus
   speaks of these sacred songs: "Not in their divine argument alone, but
   in the very critical art of composition, they may be easily made appear
   over all the kinds of lyric poesy to be incomparable." Another elegant
   scholar [2] speaking on the same subject, says, "In lyric flow and
   fire, in crushing force and majesty, that seems still to echo the awful
   sounds once heard beneath the thunder clouds of Sinai, the poetry of
   the ancient Scriptures is the most superb that ever burned within the
   breast of man."

   But the intrinsic excellence of this Book gives it still higher claims
   on our attention. written under the influence of the Spirit of
   inspiration, its subject-matter is worthy of its celestial origin. In
   general, it contains details of the national history of the Jewish
   people, records of particular portions of the life and experience of
   individuals, and predictions of future events. Each of these heads
   embraces a wide field, and they include illustrations of every
   religions truth which it is necessary for us to know, exemplifications
   of every devout feeling which it is our duty to cherish, and examples
   of every spiritual conflict which it is possible for us to experience.
   We meet with many disclosures of the greatness, majesty, and
   perfections of the only true God; his government of the world; and his
   special care over his chosen people. We meet with the varied exercises
   of the regenerated soul, and behold it at one time offering up fervent
   supplications to the Hearer of prayer, at another celebrating his
   perfections and works; at one time giving utterance to the ardent
   breathings of love to God, and trust in him, at another struggling with
   unbelief and corruption; at one time mourning under the divine
   chastisement on account of sin, at another rejoicing in a sense of
   forgiving mercy, and enjoying the peace which passeth all
   understanding. We have presented to us many wonderful predictions
   concerning the Messiah, his humiliation, sufferings, death,
   resurrection, and ascension to his Fatherright hand; his work in heaven
   as the intercessor of his people, and his authority as universal King;
   the effusion of the influences of the Holy Spirit, and the conversion
   of all nations to the faith of the Gospel. In short, we have unfolded
   to our view the final judgment, the gathering of all the righteous to
   God, and the eternal exclusion of the wicked from happiness and from
   hope.

   These and similar topics which are set forth in the noblest strains of
   poetry, and in a diction whose magnificence and sublimity correspond to
   the importance and grandeur of the sentiments, constitute the materials
   of this Book; and while they afford an incontestable proof that it Is
   inspired, that it does not consist of the creations of mere human
   genius, but is an emanation from heaven, they show that its character
   and tendency are altogether different from the character and tendency
   of the most admired poetry, which the genius of heathen nations has
   ever produced. It ministers to no depraved passion; it fosters no
   fictitious virtue; it disdains to offer its delicious incense at the
   shrine of degrading superstition. It teaches the most exalted piety,
   and the purest morality. It tends only to refine and exalt the nature
   of man, to elevate the soul to God, and inspire it with the admiration
   and love of his character, to curb the passions, purify the affections,
   and excite to the cultivation of whatsoever things are true, honest,
   just, pure, lovely, and of good report. It has guided the saint in
   doubt and difficulty; it has nerved him for self-denial and suffering;
   it has imparted support and comfort to him in the hour of death. This
   Book has accordingly been highly appreciated by the best of men in
   every age, and they have labored to find expressions in which to set
   forth its excellence. Athanasius styles it, "An epitome of the whole
   Scriptures;" Basil, "A compendium of all theology;" Luther, "A little
   Bible, and the summary of the Old Testament;" Melancthon, "The most
   elegant work extant in the world;" and for Calvin's estimate of its
   value we refer to the excellent preface with which he introduces this
   department of his labors to the attention of the reader.

   Calvin's Commentary On The Psalms, a new Translation of which is now in
   course of being presented to the English reader, is distinguished by
   many of the excellencies which have acquired for his Commentaries on
   other parts of Scripture so great reputation. In this, as in his other
   Commentaries, his first and great object is to ascertain the mind of
   the Holy Spirit. To ascertain this, he proceeds on the principle laid
   down by Melancthon, "that Scripture cannot be understood theologically,
   unless it be first understood grammatically." Before his time the
   mystical and allegorical method of explaining the Scriptures was very
   prevalent; according to which, the interpreter, dwelling very little or
   not at all upon the literal sense, sought for hidden and allegorical
   meanings. But rejecting this mode of interpretation, which contributed
   little to the right understanding of the word of God, and according to
   which the meaning was made to depend entirely upon the fancy of the
   interpreter, Calvin set himself to the investigation of the grammatical
   and literal sense, by a careful examination of the Hebrew test, and by
   a diligent attention to the drift and intention of the writer's
   discourse.

   This principle of interpretation cannot be too highly commended. It
   should first engage the attention of the commentator; and when it is
   neglected, the fundamental principle of sacred criticism is violated.
   Calvin was deeply alive to its importance. His only defect lies in his
   acting upon it too exclusively. Many of the Psalms, in addition to the
   literal meaning, have a prophetical, evangelical, and spiritual sense.
   While referring primarily to David and the nation of Israel, they have,
   at the same time, a reference to Christ and the New Testament Church,
   founded on the fact that the former were typical of the latter. Calvin,
   indeed, explains some of the Psalms on this principle. But he applies
   the principle less frequently than he might have done, without
   contravening the canons of sound hermeneutics. His great aversion to
   the mystical method of interpretation, and to the absurd and
   extravagant lengths to which it was carried by the Fathers, perhaps
   made him err on the other extreme of confining his attention too much
   to the literal meanings and directing his attention too little to the
   prophetical and spiritual character of the Book, and to the reference
   which it has to Christ and the Church. In consequence of this, his
   expositions have less unction, and contain less of rich evangelical
   sentiment, than would otherwise have distinguished them. There are,
   however, two principles of evangelical truth which he is at pains to
   inculcates whenever a fit opportunity presents itself --the doctrine of
   justification by faith in Christ without the works of the Law; and the
   necessity of personal holiness in order to salvation.

   Another excellence of this commentary is its practical character. The
   author does not confine himself to the dry and lifeless detail of mere
   grammatical praxis, as if he had been commenting on a Greek or Roman
   classic. He turns all his explanations to practical account, and thus
   his work exhibits a happy combination of critical and philological
   remark with practical exposition.

   Here, again, we find displayed the sound and penetrating judgment for
   which Calvin has been universally admired. This is manifest in the
   judicious selection which he makes from amongst a variety of
   interpretations of that which is evidently the true one, or which
   appears to be the most probable. Sometimes he pronounces a certain
   interpretation to be meagre and unsatisfactory. At other times, he
   simply states hit preference of one interpretation to another, when,
   after careful examinations it appeared to him to have the balance of
   arguments in its favor; without, however, expressing any decided
   opposition to the other, when the view which he preferred to it was
   supported only bit a slight preponderance of evidence. At other times,
   he does not decide between different interpretations, showing that with
   respect to certain words and expressions he had not come to a fixed
   opinion. In all these instances, [3] he generally shows much
   penetration and judgment. He is, no doubt, sometimes mistaken in his
   interpretation of particular passages. But when it is considered that
   the Scriptures had long been a sealed book, and that his helps were few
   and imperfect compared with those which we now possess, the wonder is,
   that he should have succeeded so well in bringing out their true
   meaning. This was chiefly owing to vigor and acuteness of intellects
   combined with a sound and discriminating judgment. These, indeed, were
   the mental qualities by which he was peculiarly distinguished. We meet
   with no flashes of poetry, no brilliant coruscation of fancy, giving
   evidence of a powerful imagination. The eloquent passages which occur
   are the eloquence of reason, not the bursts of imagination. But his
   strength of thought, the vigor and perspicacity of his intellect, the
   extraordinary power of his judgment, command our willing admiration.

   Since this commentary was first published, a great number of
   Translations of The Psalms, as well as numerous critical and
   explanatory works upon them, have made their appearance, while much new
   light has been thrown upon many passages from more extensive
   philological research, from an attention to the parallelism of Hebrew
   poetry, [4] and from the fuller information which we now possess, by
   the discoveries of modern travelers, of the natural history, customs,
   and mannered of the East, to which frequent allusion is made in The
   Psalms. But such id the acuteness of judgment, and success in
   discovering the mind of the Spirit which distinguish these prelections,
   that they are not superseded by any modern Commentary on the same
   subject: and though it is nearly three centuries since they were
   written, there are few separate works on The Psalms from which the
   student of the present day, who wishes critically to examine them, will
   derive more important assistance.

   Nor is Calvin's impartiality and integrity as an interpreter less
   apparent in this Work than his judgment. It being his first and leading
   object to ascertain the mind of the Holy Spirit, he came to the Word of
   God not for the purpose of finding arguments to establish some
   preconceived opinion or theory, but in the humble character of a
   learner, and we never find him perverting or twisting a passage to
   support even those doctrines which he most deeply cherished. So far
   from doing this, he not infrequently gives up a text which has been
   explained by other commentators as a proof of some important doctrine,
   and which he would have viewed in the same light had it not been for
   his aversion to put on Scripture a forced construction, and his
   determination rigidly to adhere to the principles of fair and logical
   interpretation. For example, these words in Psalm 2:7,

   "Jehovah hath said unto me,
   Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee,"

   have been quoted by Augustine and many other eminent divines, in proof
   of the eternal generation of the Son of God. But as Paul, in Acts
   13:33, explains them as receiving their fulfillment in the resurrection
   of Christ, Calvin sets them aside from the class of proofs which
   support the doctrine of an eternal generation, although he held that
   doctrine, [5] and considers them as referring merely to the
   manifestation afforded of Christ's Sonship by his resurrection from the
   dead. [6] Again, Psalm 8:5, etc.,

   "Thou hast made him a little lower than God, and hast crowned him with
   glory and honor," etc.,

   has been often explained as prophetic of the temporary humiliation and
   subsequent exaltation of Christ, an opinion which is supported by
   reasons far from contemptible; but Calvin, judging from the scope of
   the passage, considers it as exclusively referring to man, and that
   when Paul quotes it in Hebrews 2:7, and applies it to Christ, he
   applies it to him only by way of accommodation. [7] Again, these words
   in Psalm 33:6,

   "By the word of Jehovah were the heavens established, and all the host
   of them by the spirit of his mouth,"

   have been viewed by many judicious divines as a proof of the Trinity,
   "Jehovah," denoting the Father, "the word of Jehovah," the Son, and
   "the spirit of Jehovah's mouth," the Holy Spirit; but while Calvin
   admits that the "word of Jehovah" means the Eternal Word, the only
   begotten Son of God, yet reasoning from the sense which the phrase,
   "the spirit of Jehovah's mouth," ordinarily bears in Scripture, he
   argues that it does not there mean the third person of the adorable
   Trinity, but simply sermo, speech, although there were no truths which
   he held more firmly, and regarded as more essential to the Christian
   system, than the doctrines of the Trinity and of the Divinity of the
   Holy Spirit. [8] "It is very possible," says Tholuck, "that in
   following this direction of mind, he may have unnecessarily sacrificed
   this and the other proof text; still the principle upon which he
   proceeded is in all cases to be approved." This commentary, again,
   bears evident marks of the learning of its author. His intimate
   acquaintance with the Hebrew language, the knowledge of which is of so
   much importance to the interpretation of the Old Testament Scriptures,
   is everywhere apparent. Father Simon, whom the acrimony of controversy
   led to indulge too much in depreciating and abusing those who differed
   from him, asserts, indeed, that Calvin was so ignorant of the Hebrew
   language, that he knew nothing more than the letters. But we have only
   to examine his Commentary on The Psalms, not to speak of his
   Commentaries on other parts of the Old Testament, to be convinced that
   his knowledge of the Hebrew language was accurate and minute,
   considering the age in which he lived He frequently enters into a
   critical examination of the original text, and manifests by his
   philological remarks, brief though they be, an intimate acquaintance
   with that language; arriving, in his interpretations, at the same
   results to which a more profound exegesis and a more minute attention
   to philology have conducted modern critics. Often, when he does not
   professedly criticise the Hebrew text, or make his statements in the
   form of criticisms the Hebrew scholar will perceive that his remarks
   are founded upon a close attention to the strict meaning of the Hebrew
   words, and that he frequently states their precise import with much
   force, felicity, and delicacy of expression. Nor is proof wanting, from
   this Commentary, that Calvin had traveled over the whole field of
   knowledge, in so far as it had been explored in his day. From ancient
   and modern systems of philosophy, from civil and ecclesiastical
   history, as well as from the Greek and Roman classical he draws
   materials, and shows how he could employ with ease and power, and yet
   without the least ostentation or pedantry, his varied acquisitions for
   the illustration of sacred truth.

   In short this Work is pervaded by earnest piety and much Christian
   experience. Its whole tone evinces it to be the fruit of a soul which
   felt the deep workings of piety; of a Soul in which the love of God was
   extreme, which sought its rest and happiness in him alone, which
   recognised his hand and providence in every event, which confided in
   him in all circumstances, which looked to him as a Father and a friend
   for every blessing, and which, in all its powers, was consecrated with
   entire devotedness to Christ and the Gospel. It everywhere, too,
   bespeaks the man of large religious experience. Whether the author
   comments on the plaintive songs in which grief pours forth its
   bitterness, or on the triumphant and joyful songs in which the
   perfections and providence of God, individual and national deliverances
   are celebrated; whether he speaks of David's religious exercises, or of
   the trials of his life, or of his inward conflicts, we perceive a mind
   which had itself experienced much of what it illustrates. This
   experience eminently qualified Calvin to be an interpreter of The
   Psalms. Placed often in circumstances similar to those of David, as he
   graphically describes in his Preface, he was thus enabled accurately to
   conceive of David's train of thinking, to see things as it were with
   his eyes, to trace the complexion and character of his feelings, and
   thus to portray them in so just and natural a manner, that we are
   almost ready to think, in perusing the description of them, that they
   are described by David himself.

   This Work has been translated from the original Latin, and collated
   with the French version, which was written by the author himself. The
   French edition which has been used, and which was doubtless the last
   corrected under the author's eye, was printed in 1563, and is described
   on the title-page as "So carefully revised, and so faithfully compared
   with the Latin version, that it may be considered a new translation."
   While the Translator has made the Latin version his text book, he has
   throughout carefully collated it with the French version, by which he
   has been greatly aided in giving a clearer and fuller representation of
   his author's meaning. The French version having made its appearance
   after the Latin, and being written in Calvin's native tongue, in which
   he might be expected to write with greater ease than in a dead
   language, admired though his Latin works are for the purity of their
   classic diction, it contains numerous expansions of thought and
   expression, by which he removes the occasional obscurities of the Latin
   version, which is written in a style more compressed and concise.
   Sometimes, though not often, we meet with a complete sentence in the
   French version which is not to be found in the Latin; but the cases are
   of frequent occurrence, in which, by inserting into the French version
   a clause at the beginning, the middle, or the end of a sentence, which
   does not occur in the Latin, he explains what is obscure in the latter
   version, or introduces a new thought or expresses his meaning with
   greater clearness and with greater copiousness of language. These
   additional clauses the Translator has introduced into the text in their
   Proper place, and indicated them by adding the original French in the
   form of notes at the foot of the page. He, however, sometimes
   translates from the French version where it seems fuller and more
   perspicuous than the Latin, without indicating this by foot-notes. In a
   few instances, where the expression in the two versions is different,
   he has given the expression of both, retaining that of the Latin
   version in the texts and transferring that of the French to the foot of
   the page.

   With respect to the principle on which he has proceeded in the task of
   translating, it is sufficient simply to state, that he has endeavored
   to express the meaning of his author in language as true to the
   original as possible, avoiding being too literal on the one hand, and
   too loose on the other; as this, in his apprehension, is the method by
   which a translator can best succeed in faithfully representing to the
   reader the sense as well as the style and manner of his author.

   Calvin's version of the Sacred Text has been given in preference to
   that of our English Bible, as this was necessary to the clear
   understanding of his illustrations. The two versions, however, nearly
   resemble each other: often our English version is an accurate
   translation of Calvin's, at other times the marginal readings which are
   in some of our English Bibles. He, however, not infrequently differs
   from both; and in some instances, though not in all, where he does
   differ, his translation appears to be superior in accuracy, and places
   the sentiment of the original in a clearer light, and with greater
   effect than is done in our English version. The Scriptural quotations
   which he makes have been given in the words of our English Bible,
   except in those cases in which his argument required his own
   translation of the passage to be retained.

   This Work was translated into English some years after its first
   appearance by Arthur Golding, whose translation was published at London
   in 1571. Arthur Golding, who was of a gentleman's family and a native
   of London, was one of the most distinguished translators of the Roman
   classics in the age of Queen Elizabeth, when the translation of these
   valuable works of antiquity into the English language employed every
   pen. He translated Justin's History, Caesar's Commentaries, Ovid's
   Metamorphoses, Seneca's Benefits, and other classic authors; as well as
   various modern French and Latin works, among which are a number of
   Calvin's writings, besides The Psalms. His only original work appears
   to have been, "A Discourse upon the Earthquake that happened through
   the Realme of Englande, and other places of Christendom, the sixt of
   Aprill 1580," published in 16mo. "It is to be regretted," says Warton,
   "that he gave so much of his time to translation." [9] Golding was no
   doubt a good classical scholar, and well acquainted with the style of
   Calvin; but as his translation was executed nearly three hundred years
   ago, it every where abounds with words and phrases which are become
   antiquated and obsolete, from the great change which the English
   language has undergone since that period. Being on this account
   frequently very obscure, often unintelligible, it fails in giving a
   just representation to an English reader of the present day of Calvin's
   work, and leads him to form a less favorable estimate of its value than
   is due to its high merits. Besides, Golding does not appear to have
   seen the French version, which affords to a translator so much
   assistance in the faithful representation of Calvin's meaning.

   With respect to the Notes with which this Translation is accompanied,
   they are intended to enable the reader clearly to understand the
   meaning of such of Calvin's philological remarks and criticisms as are
   obscure, from the brevity with which they are stated; or to exhibit
   Calvin's merits as a commentator, by showing how frequently his
   interpretations are adopted and supported by the most eminent Biblical
   critics, or to illustrate the Sacred Text, by showing the precise
   meaning of the Hebrew words, or by explaining some portion of natural
   history, or some eastern custom or manner to which there is an
   allusion. The ancient versions afford important assistance in the
   explanation of difficult passages, and their rendering of particular
   texts has been occasionally given when this contributes to elucidate
   them, or to throw light on Calvin's observations. Of these versions the
   Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Jerome's, are the only ones which he
   appears to have consulted, and to the first he frequently refers.

   As the Translations of The Calvin Society are intended for the whole
   Christian community, it has been deemed out of place to enter upon
   theological questions on which difference of opinion exists among the
   various denominations of the Christian community. In making these
   Notes, the Editor has often compared Calvin's translation of the Sacred
   Text with the original Hebrew, and with the Septuagint, Vulgate, and
   Jerome's versions. He has also consulted a considerable number of
   critical works on The Psalms by some of the most eminent Biblical
   scholars who have written on this book, either as a separate
   undertaking, or in common with the other books of Scripture. Of the
   rich stores of erudition thus supplied he has freely made use; as in
   the course of the work he has carefully marked his authorities, as this
   will give greater weight to his statements. Many of the authors who are
   quoted were men of distinguished learning, judgment, and piety,
   possessed a profound acquaintance with the Hebrew language, and had
   devoted years of laborious study to the investigation of the meaning of
   this sacred book; and it is wonderful to find how closely the results
   of Calvin's investigations, even on the most difficult passages
   harmonise with the results to which modern critics guided by the
   principles of accurate hermeneutics, have arrived. This has often
   forced itself upon the attention of the Editor, and the more he has
   compared Calvin's criticisms and interpretations with the labors of
   these learned men, the higher has been raised his admiration of the
   ingenuity, penetration, learning, and critical acumen of this great
   commentator. Not a few, indeed, of the most beautiful interpretations
   which are to be found in Commentaries and critical works were first
   given forth by Calvin, although the source in which they originated has
   been forgotten. It may here be stated that the examination of the
   philology of the Sacred Text, and of critical works on the subject, has
   led the Editor to observe how closely Calvin often adheres in his
   interpretations to the import of the original Hebrew, and enabled him
   in many cases in the course of the translation to represent the meaning
   of his author more correctly than he could otherwise have done as well
   as to avoid mistakes into which Golding has sometimes fallen, evidently
   from his not being acquainted with the philology of the passage, or the
   criticism which Calvin briefly states or refers took and which it is
   difficult for the reader clearly to understand, unless he find it more
   fully stated in some other critical work.

   The Editor has to express his obligations to two of his friends who
   materially aided in the preparation of the latter part of this
   volume,--the late Revelation Alexander Duncan, A.M., formerly of
   Dundee, and the Revelation James M'lean, whose able translation of
   several of the Psalms left him little more to do than the labor of
   revision and annotation. The Editor and the Society have also been much
   indebted to the Revelation Thomas M'crie, Professor of Divinity,
   Edinburgh, not only in general for the benefit of his experience, but
   also for the trouble he has taken in examining the sheets of this
   Volume while passing through the press, and for many important
   suggestions. The Editor has great satisfaction in thus publicly
   acknowledging his obligations.

   A facsimile of the Title-Page of the French version which we have used,
   and of the title-page of Arthur Golding's translation, together with
   his Dedication, are prefixed to this Volume.

   It remains only to be added, that the last Volume will contain copious
   Indices of the principal matters contained in the Commentary and Notes,
   of the passages of Scripture more or less illustrated, and of the
   Hebrew words referred to or explained.

   Edinburgh, June 1845.

   [IT has been thought proper to preserve The Dedication which is
   prefixed to the English Translation by Arthur Golding in the original
   orthography. Besides affording a vivid idea of the style and
   phraseology of this Translator, the slightest inspection of this
   singular composition will demonstrate how very unsuitable the
   publication of such a version would have been for general use in these
   times.

   The only liberty which has been taken in reprinting this Dedication, is
   in reference to the supplying of modern punctuation, and the division
   of it into paragraphs; but in other respects it is given verbatim et
   literatim. There is only one paragraph in the whole of Golding's
   Dedication. It is dated 20th October 1571.

   Golding's version of Calvin's Commentary On The Psalms is throughout
   equally obscure and quaint; and it may justly be characterised as being
   wholly unfit for the perusal of all classes of readers of the present
   day, who do not happen to be minutely acquainted with the language and
   idiom of the sixteenth century its most uncouth and repulsive form.]

   [2] Sir David K. Sandford

   [3] From the variety of interpretations of the same passages which we
   meet with in Calvin's Commentary, and of which we have still more
   numerous specimens in Poole's Synopsis Criticorum, it is by no means to
   be supposed that the meaning of the language of Scripture is vague,
   uncertain, and unsettled. Had the professed interpreters of Scripture
   always performed their task with judgment, as well as learning and
   talent, and been guided by the rules of sound hermeneutics, the reader
   would not have been bewildered with so many different and contradictory
   interpretations. Still, however, there are words and sentences, the
   exact import of which is more or less doubtful and uncertain, so that
   it is difficult to determine between different senses which have been
   put upon them. The reasons of this are so well stated by Cresswell, in
   his preface to The Book of Psalms with Notes, (pp. 14, 15, 16,) and the
   passage has so direct a bearing on a number of the various
   interpretations, which Calvin deals with in this Commentary, that we
   shall quote it entire though it is long. "The Hebrew is not only a dead
   language, but the oldest of all dead languages; it is, moreover, the
   language of a people that lived under institutions and in a climate
   very different from those of our own country, so that the idioms with
   which it abounds cannot but be strange to our habits of thinking and
   our modes of speech; nor have we any book but the Bible itself to
   consult for an illustration of these phraseological peculiarities. The
   paucity of the words also contained in that ancient tongue is such,
   that the same Hebrew term very often bears a great variety of
   significations, the connection of which with each other cannot always
   be satisfactorily ascertained: and, again, there are words, each of
   which is found but once in the whole volume of Scripture, so that their
   meanings can only be conjectured, either from their affinity to other
   words, or from the purport of the passage wherein they occur." "The
   following are amongst the many grammatical Hebraisms which we meet with
   in The Book of Psalms. The future and past tenses are put almost
   indiscriminately, the one for the other, and the former of them is used
   occasionally to designate not that which will happen, but that which is
   accustomed to happen. The infinitive is put for every other mood, and
   also for nouns even in the accusative case. The future tense is
   sometimes expressed by a verb in the imperative mood. Two substantives
   are put instead of a substantive and an adjective; a substantive is
   frequently used adverbially; and the same substantive repeated denotes
   multitude When the negative particle occurs in the first member of a
   sentence, it is sometimes to be understood, and must be supplied, in
   the following members. Hebrew sentences are also in other respects very
   often elliptical, broken, and imperfect; and in the same sentence there
   is in many instances a change of person in the speaker, without any
   express intimation of it." "From the peculiarities above mentioned, and
   especially from the different ways in which an ellipse may be supplied,
   it is plain that the text of Scripture must needs admit of a
   considerable latitude of interpretation; so that although none of its
   important doctrines whether they relate to faith or morals, are thereby
   left doubtful, yet does it contain passages the exact meanings of which
   are more or less uncertain. The candid and pious reader, however, will
   with Augustine gladly acknowledge that all which he fully comprehends
   in the sacred volume is most excellent; whilst he looks with feelings
   of veneration upon that smaller portion of it which he less perfectly
   understands, but which the diligence and erudition of future times may,
   through divine aid, be enabled to elucidate."

   [4] Parallelism is the distinguishing characteristic of Hebrew poetry,
   and an attention to it, it must be admitted, affords much assistance in
   elucidating obscure, and explaining difficult passages. Some modern
   translations of The Psalms, as French and Skinner's, have the lines so
   arranged as to make the parallelisms apparent to the eye; which enables
   the reader to discover at a glance niceties both of structure and of
   meaning, which, in the ordinary mode of printing, might pass unnoticed
   after frequent and even close perusal. For a full investigation of this
   subject, the reader is referred to Dr Lowth's elegant Lectures on
   Sacred Poetry, and his Preliminary Dissertation prefixed to his
   translation of the prophet Isaiah, works which created a new era in
   sacred literature, by the light which they cast on the character of
   Hebrew poetry, with respect to which the learned world were previously
   unsettled and perplexed, from the obscurity which rested on the
   subject. Bishop Jebb, in his "Sacred Literature," has also investigated
   the parallelism of Hebrew poetry with much ability, and successfully
   controverted some of Bishop Lowth's positions.

   [5] That Calvin held this doctrine is evident from his [2]Commentary on
   Acts 13:33, where, after stating that the words of the second Psalm,
   above quoted, refer to the unequivocal evidence by which the Father
   proved that Christ was his Son in raising him from the dead, he
   observes "This, however, is no objection to the doctrine that Christ,
   the personal Word, was begotten by the eternal Father before time; but
   that generation is an inscrutable mystery." With respect to those who
   argue from this passage in support of that doctrine, he says, "I know
   that Augustine, and the greatest number of commentators, are better
   pleased with the subtile speculation that to-day denotes a continued or
   an eternal act. But when the Spirit of God himself is his own
   interpreter, and explains by the mouth of Paul what was spoken by
   David, we are not warranted to invent and put upon the words any other
   meaning."

   EDWARD DE VERE, ERLE OF OXINFORD,

   ARTHUR GOLDING

   Wisheth Increace Of Godly Knowldge,
   With Health, Honour, And Prosperitie.

   IT may, peraduenture, be thought in respect of the matter wherof this
   woork treateth, that it ought rather to haue bin dedicated to som of my
   very good Lords, the Lords Spirituall, or to some of the Clergie, all
   to whom such things seeme to perteine more peculiarly, by reason of
   theyr charge and calling. Which opinions as I purpose not to encounter,
   but rather most willingly submit my selfe and my doings to the
   iudgement and reformation of such reuerend Fathers and learned men, as
   God hath put ill trust with the care of his flock, and the charge of
   his Church within this Realms euen so forasmuch as the things which the
   Holy Ghost vttereth in the Sacred Scriptures belong indifferently unto
   all men, of what estate, degrees sex, age, or calling, so euer they be,
   without exception: I haue at this time set all other respects and
   considerations aside, and only had an eye to my dutie towards your
   Lordship.

   And bicause my continuall troubles and sutes in the Lawe (as yit
   vnended after more than three yeeres trauel) haue bereft mee of the
   greatest part of my timer, so as I could not dispatch things with such
   expedition as otherwise I might haue done; my care and indeuer hath bin
   too recompence mine ouerlong silence with goodnes of matter, that might
   redound to the furtherance of our Christen common weale, and also be
   meete for your Lordship too looke vpon. But you, perchaunce, according
   too the noble courage and disposition of your yeeres, doo looke I
   should presente vntoo you some Historie of the Conquestes and affaires
   of mightie Princes, some treatise of the government of common weales,
   some description of the platte of the whole Earth, or some discourse of
   chiualrie and feates of Armes. These things are, in deede, meete
   studies for a noble manne, and in their season right necessary for the
   common welth; but as nowe I present vntoo your honor muche greater
   things that is, to wit, true Religyon, true Godlynesse, true Vertue,
   wythout the whych, neyther force, policie, nor freend ship, are of any
   value, neyther can any common weale any Cities any householde, or any
   company, bee wel gouerned, or haue any stable and long continuance.
   These be the things wherin your Lordship may do God, your Prince, and
   your Cuntrie, best seruice, and which do giue true nobilitie, or rather
   are the very nobilitie it self.

   The greater that you are of birth and calling, the more doo these
   things belong vnto you. The greater gifts of Nature, the mo graces of
   mind, the mo worldly benefites that God hath bestowed vppon you, the
   more are you bound to be thankful vnto him. But thankful you cannot bee
   without the true knoweledge of him, neyther can you know him rightly
   but by his woord. For his sword is the lanterne of your feete, and the
   light of your steppes. Whosoeuer walked without it, walketh but in
   darkenesse, though he were otherwise as sharpe sighted as Linceus or
   Argus, and had all the sciences artes, conning, eloquence, and wisedome
   of the worlde. No sound and substantiall truthe is too bee founde any
   where els saue onely there. And, therfore, the Holy Ghost, by the mouth
   of Moyses, willeth you that the lawe of God (that is to say, his word
   and doctrine) shoulde not departe from your mouth, but that you should
   bynde it about your wrists, imbroyder it vpon your garments ingraue it
   vpon the postes of your house, and write it in the tables of your hart.
   And Dauid, speaking by the same spirite, exhorteth you by his owne
   example to set your whole delight in it, too occupy your selfe in it
   day and night, too lay it vp in your hart, too set more store by it
   than by riches, to be mindeful of it, to make it your counsayler, to
   stick too it, too talke of it afore Kings and greate men, to loue it,
   too make your songs of it, to remember it night and day, too count it
   sweeter than Hony, too take it as an heritage, and too make it the ioy
   of your hart. Neyther is it without cause that GOD calleth so ofte
   vppon Magistrates and noble men by name, that they should be diligent
   in his worde. For looke how muche the greater burthen and charge lyeth
   vpon their shoulders and the greater accounte they haue to make afore
   him; so muche the greater wisedome and knoweledge haue they need of,
   which are not to be atteyned elsewhere than in his lawe. I beseeche
   your Lordship consider how God hath placed you vpon a high stage in the
   eyes of all men, as a guide, patterne, insample, and leader vnto others
   if your vertues be vncounterfayted, if your religion be sound and pure,
   if your doings be according to true godliness you shalbe a stay to your
   cuntrie, a comforte too good men, a bridle too euil men, a ioy too your
   freends, a corzie too your enemies, and an increace of honor to your
   owne house. But if you should become eyther a counterfayt Protestant,
   or a peruerse Papist, or a colde and carelesse newter, (which God
   forbid,) the harme could not be expressed which you should do to your
   natiue Cuntrie. For (as Cicero, no lesse truely than wisely affirmeth,
   and as the sorrowfull dooings of our Present dayes do too certeinly
   auouch) greate men hurt not the common weale so much by beeing euil in
   respect of themselues, as by drawing others vnto euil by their euil
   example. I assure your Lordshippe I write not these things as though I
   suspected you to be digressed from that soundnes and sinceritie wherein
   you were continually trayned and traded vnder that vigilant Vlisses of
   our common welth, sometyme your Lordship's carefull Chyron or Phoenix,
   and nowe your faithful Patroclus, or as though I mistrusted your
   Lordship to be degenerated from the excellent towardnes, which by
   foreward proof hath giuen glad foretokens, and (I trust also) luckye
   hansels of an honorable age too ensue; but bycause the loue that I owe
   to God and his religion, the care that I haue of the church and my
   natiue cuntrie, the dutie wherin Nature hath bound mee to your
   Lordship, and (which is an occasion too make all good and honest men
   look about them) the perilousnes of this present time, wherin all
   meanes possible are practiced to ouerthrowe Christe's kingdom and to
   abolishe all faithfullnes from among men, make mee to feare and
   forecast, not so much what is true, as what may bee noysome and
   hurtful; and, therfore, I seek rather too profite by wholesome
   admonition, than to delight by pleasant speeches. These be no dayes of
   daliance; for Sathan, the workmaster of all mischeef, being greued that
   his own king dome draweth to an end, not onely goeth about like a
   roring Lyon too deuoure folke by open force, but also like a slie
   Serpent setteth snares and pitfalles innumerable, to intrap men and
   bring them to destruction by policie laying wayt for all men, but
   specially for such as are of high estate, as who alwayes carye greatest
   nombers with them which waye so euer they incline. Hee turneth himselfe
   intoo mo shapes than euer did Proteus: and suche as himselfe is, suche
   are his ministers. First and foremost the obstinate and stubborneharted
   Papistes, the sworne enemies of God, the pestilent poyson of mankinde,
   and the very welsprings of all error, hipocrisie, and vngraciousnes,
   (who, while they beare sway, bee more cruel than Beares, Wolues, and
   Tigres; and when they bee kept vnder, more deceitfull than Cerastes and
   Crocodyles; and at all times more mischeuous than the Diuel himselfe,)
   labor with tooth and nayle too winde their owne trash into credit with
   all men, and to bring the heauenly doctrine of the Gospel in hatred.

   Ageine, the Atheistes, which say in their hartes there is no God; and
   the Epicures, which depriue God of his prouidence in gouerning the
   world, as though hee eyther vnderstoode not what is doone vppon Earth,
   or els cared not for mennes affaires: seeke they not by all meanes
   possible too weede all Religion, all feare of God, all remorse of
   conscience out of mennes harts? Out of these rootes spring other impes,
   no lesse perniciouse than the stockes of whiche they come, men of all
   Religions, Shippemen that canne sayle with all wethers, Carpenters that
   can hewe with bothe handes, Laddes that canne holde with the Hare and
   hunt with the Hounde, and (as the Scripture termeth them) time-seruers
   and menpleasers. Of which torte be the picthank Preests of Hammon, who,
   with the venemouse blaste of their filthie flattery, corrupt the wel
   instructed mindes of our Alexranders, (that is to say, of our noble
   men,) by bearing them in hand, that they bee the sonnes of Iupiter, add
   making them beleeue themselues too bee Gods, yea, sometimes before they
   be scarce men. These, after the maner of Panthers and Mermaides,
   astonne the senses with a deadly sweetnes, and work destruction by
   delighting. Moreouer, to the further withdrawing of men's minds from
   the estimation of the sound Religion, it falleth out that euen in the
   outward face of the Church there be many Hipocrites, many looce liuers,
   many Sectaries, and many wranglers, whiche pretending the countenance
   of Chryste's flock, but beeing in deede the Deuil's hirelings,
   confessing GOD with their mouth, but denying him in their works, cause
   his holy, pure, and reuerend doctrine to bee slaundered and ill-spoken
   of among the Gentiles, (that is, too wit, among the Papist and
   worldlings,) and so alienate men from Christ.

   The ignorant sort also deeming things vntowardly by the outward shew,
   charge the Gospell with the faultes of men, which it reprooueth and
   bringeth too lyght, as who would Say, that hee whiche bewrayeth a
   Murtherer, or rebuketh an Adulterer, were too bee counted an offender
   in the same caces, bicause hee discouereth their wickednesse, too the
   intent too haue it punished or redressed. And these are
   stumbling-blocks common to all sortes of men; but more peculiar to
   great menne are those that I spake of in the third place, and also
   these ensuing, namely, noblenesse of birth, renowne of Aunceters, fauor
   of their Prince, freendship of their peeres, awe of their inferiours,
   great alyances, greate retinewes depending vpon them, libertie aboue
   the common rate, welth, honor, riches, ease, sumptuouse fare, costly
   apparel, gorgeouse buildings, attendaunce of seruants, and suche other
   like, whiche as they bee the singuler good giftes and benefites of God
   bestowed vpon them for their comfort, to the end they should the more
   loue him and imbrace his truthe: so Sathan abusing the infirmitie and
   corruption of man's nature, dooth in many menne wrest them all too a
   contrary ende, namely, too the proude contempt and impugning, or at
   leastwise to the carelesse neglecting of God's true Religion and
   seruice.

   As for the fraylnesse of youth it self, the open manaces and priuie
   practizes of Antichrist, the common hatred and disdeine of the Worlde
   ageinst the sincere worshippers of God, the hardnesse and aduersities
   which they endure in this life, and infinite other by matters whiche
   are no small hinderances too the proceeding of the Gospel, I wil not
   stand too intreat of them. For doubtlesse, although Antichrist were
   abolished although Sathan were a sleepe, although the world were at one
   with vs. although wicked counsel were vtterly put too silence, although
   no euil example were giuen vs. although no outwarde stumbling-blocke
   were cast in our waye; yit haue wee one thing in our selues and of our
   selues, (euen originall sinne, concupiscence, or lust,) which neuer
   ceaseth too egge vs and allure vs from God, and too staine vs with all
   kinde of vnclennes, according as Sainct Iames sayth: Every man is
   tempted of his owne lust. This is the breth of the venemouse Cockatrice
   which hath infected the whole offspring of Adam. This is the sting of
   that olde Serpent whose wounds neither Chyron, Aesculupius, nor Apollo,
   can heale, no, nor any wight in Heauen or Earth, saue onely God. This
   is the bitter fountaine Exampeus, which with his brackishnesse marreth
   the sweete Riuer Hipanis, that is to say, the flowing streame of all
   God's graces, benefited and gifts in vs.

   Good cause haue we therfore to bee forewarned and continually
   admonished to beware of the mischeef that is armed with so many weapons
   and policies to anoy: specially considering how the operation therof is
   to slea both bodie and soule, and to drown them togither in to endles
   damnation. For this I dare be bolde to say vpon the warrant of assured
   truthe, that whosoeuer is but lightly blasted with the poyson of
   Papistrie, is the vnapter to all the duties of true vertue and
   godlines, like as a Cripple or lame man is the vnmeeter and vnabler for
   the affaires of this life. But as for him that is throughly saped in
   it, and hathe digested it into his bowels, and hath setled the roots of
   it in the bottome of his hart; depending vpon the Antichrist of Rome as
   vpon the mouth of God, He can neyther be the faithful seruant of God,
   nor a hartie Subiect too his Prince, nor a good and sound member of the
   common welth, vntill hee haue done as the Snake dooth when he commeth
   to engender with the Lamprey.

   For the better manifestation of all the which things I besech your good
   Lordship to peruse this present books, which doubtlesse, for the
   exceellency therof, not onely deserueth more singular commendation than
   man's wit is able to yeeld, but also is worthy too be had continually
   in all mennes hands, or rather too bee printed in their hartes. For if
   you haue an eye too the Authors, it was written by Prophets, Preestes,
   and Kinges, inspired with the Holye Ghost, the fountaine of an
   vnderstanding, wysedom, and truth, and auouched onto vs by Christie the
   Sonne of the euellasting God. Or if you haue an eye to the matter, it
   conteineth a treatise of the Doctrine of lyfe and euerlasting
   Saluation, the particulars wherof are as many as are the points of true
   Religion and holinesse to Godward, or the points of faithfull meening
   and honest dealing too manward. And these things are common to it with
   the residue of holy Scripture.

   The thing that is peculiar to it, is the maner of the handling of the
   matters wherof it treateth. For whereas other partes of holy writ
   (whither they be historicall, morall, iudiciall, ceremoniall, or
   propheticall) do commonly set down their treatises in open and plaine
   declarations; this parte consisting of them all, wrappeth vp things in
   types and figures, describing them finder borowed personages, and
   oftentimes winding in matters by preuention, speaking of thinges too
   come as if they were past or present, and of things past as if they
   were in dooing, and euery man is made a bewrayer of the secretes of his
   owne hart. And forasmuche as it consisteth cheefly of prayer and
   thanksgiving, or (which comprehendeth them bothe) of inuocation, whiche
   is a communication with God, and requireth rather an earnest and deuout
   lifting vp of the minde, than a loud or curious vtterance of the voice:
   there be many vnperfect sentences, many broken speeches, and many
   displaced words, according as the voice of the partie that prayed was
   eyther preuented with the swiftnesse of his thoughtes, or interrupted
   with vehemency of ioy or greef, or forced to surcease through
   infirmities that hee might recouer newe strength and cheerfulnesse, by
   interminding God's former promises and benefites. Notwithstanding, the
   obscuritie of those places is not so great but that it may be easely
   ouercome, by such as, when they pray, doo vtterly sequester their
   mindes from all earthly imaginations and fleshly conceits, and after a
   sort forsaking their bodies for the time, do mount vppe aboue the world
   by faith, and present themselues before the heauenly throne of grace,
   to seek the vnspeakable and inestimable comfort of their soules.

   Suche are the conteints, and suche is the maner or disposition of the
   ground-worke of this booke, that is to say, of the Psalmes themselues.
   Whervnto (for the better vnderstanding of them) heere is added an
   exposition or Commentarie written in Latin by that learned Clerk and
   faithful minister of Chryst in the church of Geneua, Master Iohn
   Caluin, whose worthy praise and commendation, his owne manifolde woorks
   moste peinfully, sincerely, and soundly set foorth too the greate
   furtherance and profite of the whole Christen common weale, doo better
   declare than my pen can vtter or my wit deuice. And among the reste of
   them, it is thoughte of most learned men, that next vntoo his
   Institutions, this presente volume beareth the Bel, bothe for varietie
   of matter, substantialnes of doctrine, depth of iudgement, and
   perfectnesse of penning. For it is not puffed vp with vaine sound of
   emptie woords, nor with Rhetorical inlarging of painted sentences, but
   it is stuffed with piththy and grounded matter, such as plainly sheweth
   him too haue bin a man indued with the Spirite of God, and also well
   practized and tryed in the affaires and troubles of this world.

   What is to bee thought of the translation of it, that I remitte to your
   Lordship's fauourable acceptation, vnder whose Antesigne it is my
   desire that it may fight in the defense and maintenance of the true
   religion ageinst Antichrist and his wicked members. Onely thus muche I
   may safely say of it, that in all pointes (to the vttermoste of my
   power, and according to the abilitie which God hath giuen me to edifie
   withall) I haue sincerely performed the dutie of a faithfull
   Interpreter, rather indeuering too lay foorth things plainlye (yea, and
   sometimes also homely and grossely) too the vnderstanding of many, than
   too indyte things curyously too the pleasing of a fewe. For in this and
   suche other workes, the rude and ignorant haue more interest than the
   learned and skillful. If any thing be amisse, (as I dare not presume
   too vpholde that nothing hath escaped mee in so great a woorke,) my
   hartie desire is, that the same may be amended by such as are of sound
   iudgement and knowledge in God's woorde, so as no inconuenience may
   ensue of it too the churche of Christ. And look what I request in the
   behalfe of this present booke, the same do I request for all other
   books whiche I haue or (by God's grace and permission) shall heerafter
   put foorth for the edifying of Chrystes flock: for I knowe how suche
   things are the woork of God and not of man.

   What remayneth then, but that your Lordship, framing your selfe
   according to the rule of God's most holy word, should hie you apace to
   the atteinment of the true honor and immortall glory, by subduing
   sinne, the world, and the Deuil, the Hectors that cannot bee vanquished
   but by a christen Achilles; and by your good guyding bring many vnto
   Christ, that in the end you may receiue the rewarde of true and perfect
   blissednesse, euen the everlasting salvation of the soule, whiche is
   the faire Helen for whose safetie it behooueth all good men too endure,
   not tenne yeeres warre, but continuall warre all their life long. To
   the furtherance wherof, God hath by householde alyance lincked vnto
   your Lordship a long experienced Nestor, whose counsaile and footsteps
   if you folowe, no doubte but you shalbee bothe happie in your selfe,
   and singularly profitable to your common welth; and moreouer, God shall
   blisse you with plentiful and godly issue by your vertuous and
   deerbeloued Spouse, to continew the honor and renoavne of your noble
   house after the happy knitting vp of bothe your yeeres, which I pray
   God may bee many in vnseperable loue, like the loue of Ceix and
   Alcyonee, to the glory of God, and the contentation of bothe your
   desires.

   his wit, valor, and Patriotism. In two several tournaments he was
   honored by receiving the prize from the hand of his mistress, Queen
   Elizabeth, baring been led armed, by two ladies, into the Royal
   Presence Chamber. Walpole notes that he was an admired poet, and
   reckoned the best waiter of comedy in his time. He died at a very
   advanced age, June 24, 1604. It is extremely probable that Arthur
   Golding, the old Translator, was related, perhaps not distantly, to
   this nobleman. It appeals from Dugdale, and other authorities, that
   John, 16th Earl of Oxford, his father, married Margaret, daughter of
   John Golding, and sister of Sir Edward Golding, for his second wife, by
   whom he had Earl Edward, after whom it is likely he was named, and a

   THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE

   JOHN CALVIN

   TO THE GODLY AND INGENUOUS READERS, GREETING.

   IF the reading of these my Commentaries confer as much benefit on the
   Church of God as I myself have reaped advantage from the composition of
   them, I shall have no reason to regret that I have undertaken this
   work. Having expounded here, in our small school, the Book of Psalms,
   about three years ago, I thought that I had by this means sufficiently
   discharged my duty, and had resolved not to publish to the world what I
   had familiarly taught those of my own household. And, in fact, before I
   had undertaken to expound this book in my lectures, at the request of
   my brethren, I said what was true, that I had kept away from this
   subject, because that most faithful teacher of the Church of God,
   Martin Bucer, had labored in this field with such singular learning,
   diligence, fidelity, and success, that at least there was not so great
   need that I should put my hand to the work. And had the Commentaries of
   Wolphangus Musculus at that time been published, I would not have
   omitted to do them justice, by mentioning them in the same way, since
   he too, in the judgment of good men, has earned no small praise by his
   diligence and industry in this walk. I had not yet come to the end of
   the book, when, lo! I am urged by renewed solicitations not to suffer
   my lectures, which certain persons had carefully, faithfully, and not
   without great labor, taken down, to be lost to the world. My purpose
   still remained unaltered; only I promised what for a long time I had
   been thinking of, to write something on the subject in the French
   language, that my countrymen might not be without the means of being
   enabled to understand so useful a book when perusing it. Whilst I am
   thinking of making this attempt, suddenly, and contrary to my first
   design, it occurred to me, by what impulse I know not, to compose in
   Latin, only as it were in the way of trial, an exposition of one Psalm.
   When I found that my success corresponded to my desire far beyond what
   I had ventured to anticipate, I was encouraged, and accordingly began
   to make the same attempt in a few other Psalms. On perceiving this, my
   intimate friends, as if in this way they held me bound, urged me with
   the greater confidence not to desist from my course. One reason which
   made me comply with their solicitations, and which also had from the
   commencement induced me to make this first attempt, was an apprehension
   that at some future period what had been taken down from my lectures,
   might be published to the world contrary to my wishes or at least
   without my knowledge. I can truly say, that I was drawn to execute this
   work rather from such an apprehension, than led to it from my own free
   will. At the same time, as I continued to prosecute the work, I began
   to perceive more distinctly that this was by no means a superfluous
   undertaking, and I have also felt from my own individual experience,
   that to readers who are not so exercised, I would furnish important
   assistance in understanding The Psalms. The varied and resplendid
   riches which are contained it this treasury it is no easy matter to
   express in words; so much so, that I well know that whatever I shall be
   able to say will be far from approaching the excellence of the subject.
   But as it is better to give to my readers some taste, however small, of
   the wonderful advantages they will derive from the study of this book,
   than to be entirely silent on the point, I may be permitted briefly to
   advert to a matter, the greatness of which does not admit of being
   fully unfolded. I have been accustomed to call this book, I think not
   inappropriately, "An Anatomy of all the Parts of the Soul;" for there
   is not an emotion of which any one can be conscious that is not here
   represented as in a mirror. Or rather, the Holy Spirit has here drawn
   to the life all the griefs, sorrows, fears, doubts, hopes, cares,
   perplexities, in short, all the distracting emotions with which the
   minds of men are wont to be agitated. The other parts of Scripture
   contain the commandments which God enjoined his servants to announce to
   us. But here the prophets themselves, seeing they are exhibited to us
   as speaking to God, and laying open all their inmost thoughts and
   affections, call, or rather draw, each of us to the examination of
   himself in particulars in order that none of the many infirmities to
   which we are subject, and of the many vices with which we abound, may
   remain concealed. It is certainly a rare and singular advantage, when
   all lurking places are discovered, and the heart is brought into the
   light, purged from that most baneful infection, hypocrisy. In short, as
   calling upon God is one of the principal means of securing our safety,
   and as a better and more unerring rule for guiding us in this exercise
   cannot be found elsewhere than in The Psalms, it follows, that in
   proportion to the proficiency which a man shall have attained in
   understanding them, will be his knowledge of the most important part of
   celestial doctrine. Genuine and earnest prayer proceeds first from a
   sense of our need, and next, from faith in the promises of God. It is
   by perusing these inspired compositions, that men will be most
   effectually awakened to a sense of their maladies, and, at the same
   time, instructed in seeking remedies for their cure. In a word,
   whatever may serve to encourage us when we are about to pray to God, is
   taught us in this book. And not only are the promises of God presented
   to us in it, but oftentimes there is exhibited to us one standing, as
   it were, amidst the invitations of God on the one hand, and the
   impediments of the flesh on the other, girding and preparing himself
   for prayer: thus teaching us, if at any time we are agitated with a
   variety of doubts, to resist and fight against them, until the soul,
   freed and disentangled from all these impediments, rise up to God; and
   not only so, but even when in the midst of doubts, fears, and
   apprehensions, let us put forth our efforts in prayer, until we
   experience some consolation which may calm and bring contentment to our
   minds. [11] Although distrust may shut the gate against our prayers,
   yet we must not allow ourselves to give way, whenever our hearts waver
   or are agitated with inquietude, but must persevere until faith finally
   come forth victorious from these conflicts. In many places we may
   perceive the exercise of the servants of God in prayer so fluctuating,
   that they are almost overwhelmed by the alternate hope of success and
   apprehension of failure, and gain the prize only by strenuous
   exertions. We see on the one hand, the flesh manifesting its infirmity;
   and on the other, faith putting forth its power; and if it is not so
   valiant and courageous as might be desired, it is at least prepared to
   fight until by degrees it acquire perfect strength. But as those things
   which serve to teach us the true method of praying aright will be found
   scattered through the whole of this Commentary, I will not now stop to
   treat of topics which it will be necessary afterwards to repeat, nor
   detain my readers from proceeding to the work itself. Only it appeared
   to me to be requisite to show in passing, that this book makes known to
   us this privilege, which is desirable above all others -- that not only
   is there opened up to us familiar access to God, but also that we have
   permission and freedom granted us to lay open before him our
   infirmities which we would be ashamed to confess before men. Besides
   there is also here prescribed to us an infallible rule for directing us
   with respect to the right manner of offering to God the sacrifice of
   praise, which he declares to be most precious in his sight, and of the
   sweetest odour. There is no other book in which there is to be found
   more express and magnificent commendations, both of the unparalleled
   liberality of God towards his Church, and of all his works; there is no
   other book in which there is recorded so many deliverances nor one in
   which the evidences and experiences of the fatherly providence and
   solicitude which God exercises towards us are celebrated with such
   splendor of diction, and yet with the strictest adherence to truth, in
   short, there is no other book in which we are more perfectly taught the
   right manner of praising God, or in which we are more powerfully
   stirred up to the performance of this religious exercise. Moreover
   although The Psalms are replete with all the precepts which serve to
   frame our life to every part of holiness, piety, and righteousness, yet
   they will principally teach and train us to bear the cross; and the
   bearing of the cross is a genuine proof of our obedience, since by
   doing this, we renounce the guidance of our own affections and submit
   ourselves entirely to God, leaving him to govern us, and to dispose of
   our life according to his will, so that the afflictions which are the
   bitterest and most severe to our nature, become sweet to us, because
   they proceed from him. In one word, not only will we here find general
   commendations of the goodness of God, which may teach men to repose
   themselves in him alone, and to seek all their happiness solely in him;
   and which are intended to teach true believers with their whole hearts
   confidently to look to him for help in all their necessities; but we
   will also find that the free remission of sins, which alone reconciles
   God towards us and procures for us settled peace with him, [12] is so
   set forth and magnified, as that here there is nothing wanting which
   relates to the knowledge of eternal salvation.

   Now, if my readers derive any fruit and advantage from the labor which
   I have bestowed in writing these Commentaries, I would have them to
   understand that the small measure of experience which I have had by the
   conflicts with which the Lord has exercised me, has in no ordinary
   degree assisted me, not only in applying to present use whatever
   instruction could be gathered from these divine compositions, but also
   in more easily comprehending the design of each of the writers. And as
   David holds the principal place among them, it has greatly aided me in
   understanding more fully the complaints made by him of the internal
   afflictions which the Church had to sustain through those who gave
   themselves out to be her members, that I had suffered the same or
   similar things from the domestic enemies of the Church. For although I
   follow David at a great distance, and come far short of equaling him;
   or rather, although in aspiring slowly and with great difficulty to
   attain to the many virtues in which he excelled, I still feel myself
   tarnished with the contrary vices; yet if I have any things in common
   with him, I have no hesitation in comparing myself with him. In reading
   the instances of his faith, patience, fervor, zeal, and integrity, it
   has, as it ought, drawn from me unnumbered groans and sighs, that I am
   so far from approaching them; but it has, notwithstanding, been of very
   great advantage to me to behold in him as in a mirror, both the
   commencement of my calling, and the continued course of my function; so
   that I know the more assuredly, that whatever that most illustrious
   king and prophet suffered, was exhibited to me by God as an example for
   imitation. My condition, no doubt, is much inferior to his, and it is
   unnecessary for me to stay to show this. But as he was taken from the
   sheepfold, and elevated to the rank of supreme authority; so God having
   taken me from my originally obscure and humble condition, has reckoned
   me worthy of being invested with the honorable office of a preacher and
   minister of the gospel. When I was as yet a very little boy, my father
   had destined me for the study of theology. But afterwards when he
   considered that the legal profession commonly raised those who followed
   it to wealth this prospect induced him suddenly to change his purpose.
   Thus it came to pass, that I was withdrawn from the study of
   philosophy, and was put to the study of law. To this pursuit I
   endeavored faithfully to apply myself in obedience to the will of my
   father; but God, by the secret guidance of his providence, at length
   gave a different direction to my course. And first, since I was too
   obstinately devoted to the superstitions of Popery to be easily
   extricated from so profound an abyss of mire, God by a sudden
   conversion subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was
   more hardened in such matters than might have been expected from one at
   my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge
   of true godliness I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire
   to make progress therein, that although I did not altogether leave off
   other studies, I yet pursued them with less ardor. I was quite
   surprised to find that before a year had elapsed, all who had any
   desire after purer doctrine were continually coming to me to learn,
   although I myself was as yet but a mere novice and tyro. Being of a
   disposition somewhat unpolished and bashful, which led me always to
   love the shade and retirement, I then began to seek some secluded
   corner where I might be withdrawn from the public view; but so far from
   being able to accomplish the object of my be desire, all my retreats
   were like public schools. In short, whilst my one great object was to
   live in seclusion without being known, God so led me about through
   different turnings and changes, that he never permitted me to rest in
   any place, until, in spite of my natural disposition, he brought me
   forth to public notice. Leaving my native country, France, I in fact
   retired into Germany, expressly for the purpose of being able there to
   enjoy in some obscure corner the repose which I had always desired, and
   which had been so long denied me. But lo! whilst I lay hidden at Basle,
   and known only to a few people, many faithful and holy persons were
   burnt alive in France; and the report of these burnings having reached
   foreign nations, they excited the strongest disapprobation among a
   great part of the Germans, whose indignation was kindled against the
   authors of such tyranny. In order to allay this indignation, certain
   wicked and lying pamphlets were circulated, stating that none were
   treated with such cruelty but Anabaptists and seditious persons, who by
   their perverse ravings and false opinions, were overthrowing not only
   religion but also all civil order. Observing that the object which
   these instruments of the court aimed at by their disguises, was not
   only that the disgrace of shedding so much innocent blood might remain
   buried under the false charges and calumnies which they brought against
   the holy martyrs after their death, but also, that afterwards they
   might be able to proceed to the utmost extremity in murdering the poor
   saints without exciting compassion towards them in the breasts of any,
   it appeared to me, that unless I opposed them to the utmost of my
   ability, my silence could not be vindicated from the charge of
   cowardice and treachery. This was the consideration which induced me to
   publish my Institute of the Christian Religion. My objects were, first,
   to prove that these reports were false and calumnious, and thus to
   vindicate my brethren, whose death was precious in the sight of the
   Lord; and next, that as the same cruelties might very soon after be
   exercised against many unhappy individuals, foreign nations might be
   touched with at least some compassion towards them and solicitude about
   them. When it was then published, it was not that copious and labored
   work which it now is, but only a small treatise containing a summary of
   the principal truths of the Christian religion, and it was published
   with no other design than that men might know what was the faith held
   by those whom I saw basely and wickedly defamed by those flagitious and
   perfidious flatterers. That my object was not to acquire fame, appeared
   from this, that immediately after I left Basle, and particularly from
   the fact that nobody there knew that I was the author. Wherever else I
   have gone, I have taken care to conceal that I was the author of that
   performance; and I had resolved to continue in the same privacy and
   obscurity, until at length William Farel detained me at Geneva, not so
   much by counsel and exhortation, as by a dreadful imprecation, which I
   felt to be as if God had from heaven laid his mighty hand upon me to
   arrest me. As the most direct road to Strasburg, to which I then
   intended to retire, was shut up by the wars, I had resolved to pass
   quickly by Geneva, without staying longer than a single night in that
   city. A little before this, Popery had been driven from it by the
   exertions of the excellent person whom I have named, and Peter Viret;
   but matters were not yet brought to a settled state, and the city was
   divided into unholy and dangerous factions. Then an individual who now
   basely apostatised and returned to the Papists, discovered me and made
   me known to others. Upon this, Farel, who burned with an extraordinary
   zeal to advance the gospel, immediately strained every nerve to detain
   me. And after having learned that my heart was set upon devoting myself
   to private studies for which I wished to keep myself free from other
   pursuits, and finding that he gained nothing by entreaties, he
   proceeded to utter an imprecation that God would curse my retirement,
   and the tranquillity of the studies which I sought, if I should
   withdraw and refuse to give assistance, when the necessity was so
   urgent. By this imprecation I was so stricken with terror, that I
   desisted from the journey which I had undertaken; but sensible of my
   natural bashfulness and timidity, I would not bring myself under
   obligation to discharge any particular office. After that, four months
   had scarcely elapsed, when, on the one hand, the Anabaptists began to
   assail us, and, on the other, a certain wicked apostate, who being
   secretly supported by the influence of some of the magistrates of the
   city, was thus enabled to give us a great deal of trouble. At the same
   time, a succession of dissensions fell out in the city [13] which
   strangely afflicted us. Being, as I acknowledge, naturally of a timid,
   softer and pusillanimous disposition, I was compelled to encounter
   these violent tempests as part of my early training; and although I did
   not sink under them, yet I was not sustained by such greatness of mind,
   as not to rejoice more than it became me, when, in consequence of
   certain commotions, I was banished from Geneva. By this means set at
   liberty and loosed from the tie of my vocation, I resolved to live in a
   private station, free from the burden and cares of any public charge,
   when that most excellent servant of Christ, Martin Bucer, employing a
   similar kind of remonstrance and protestation as that to which Farel
   had recourse before, drew me back to a new station. Alarmed by the
   example of Jonas which he set before me, I still continued in the work
   of teaching. And although I always continued like myself, studiously
   avoiding celebrity; [14] yet I was carried, I know not how, as it were
   by force to the Imperial assemblies, where, willing or unwilling, I was
   under the necessity of appearing before the eyes of many. Afterwards,
   when the Lord having compassion on this city, had allayed the hurtful
   agitations and broils which prevailed in it, and by his wonderful power
   had defeated both the wicked counsels and the sanguinary attempts of
   the disturbers of the Republic, necessity was imposed upon me of
   returning to my former charge, contrary to my desire and inclination.
   The welfare of this church, it is true, lay so near my heart, that for
   its sake I would not have hesitated to lay down my life; but my
   timidity nevertheless suggested to me many reasons for excusing myself
   from again willingly taking upon my shoulders so heavy a burden. At
   length, however, a solemn and conscientious regard to my duty,
   prevailed with me to consent to return to the flock from which I had
   been torn; but with what grief, tears, great anxiety and distress I did
   this, the Lord is my best witness, and many godly persons who would
   have wished to see me delivered from this painful state, had it not
   been that that which I feared, and which made me give my consent,
   prevented them and shut their mouths. Were I to narrate the various
   conflicts by which the Lord has exercised me since that time, and by
   what trials he has proved me, it would make a long history. But that I
   may not become tedious to my readers by a waste of words, I shall
   content myself with repeating briefly what I have touched upon a little
   before, that in considering the whole course of the life of David, [15]
   it seemed to me that by his own footsteps he showed me the way, and
   from this I have experienced no small consolation. As that holy king
   was harassed by the Philistines and other foreign enemies with
   continual wars, while he was much more grievously afflicted by the
   malice and wickedness of some perfidious men amongst his own people, so
   I can say as to myself, that I have been assailed on all sides, and
   have scarcely been able to enjoy repose for a single moment, but have
   always had to sustain some conflict either from enemies without or
   within the Church. Satan has made many attempts to overthrow the fabric
   of this Church; and once it came to this, that I, altogether feeble and
   timorous as I am, was compelled to break and put a stop to his deadly
   assaults by putting my life in danger, and opposing my person to his
   blows. Afterwards, for the space of five years, when some wicked
   libertines were furnished with undue influence, and also some of the
   common people, corrupted by the allurements and perverse discourse of
   such persons, desired to obtain the liberty of doing whatever they
   pleased, without controls I was under the necessity of fighting without
   ceasing to defend and maintain the discipline of the Church. To these
   irreligious characters. and despisers of the heavenly doctrine, it was
   a matter of entire indifference, although the Church should sink into
   ruin, provided they obtained what they sought, -- the power of acting
   just as they pleased. Many, too, harassed by poverty and hunger, and
   others impelled by insatiable ambition or avarice and a desire of
   dishonest gain, were become so frantic, that they chose rather, by
   throwing all things into confusion, to involve themselves and us in one
   common ruin, than to remain quiet by living peaceably and honestly.
   [16] During the whole of this lengthened period, I think that there is
   scarcely any of the weapons which are forged in the workshop of Satan,
   which has not been employed by them in order to obtain their object.
   And at length matters had come to such a state, that an end could be
   put to their machinations in no other way than cutting them off by an
   ignominious death; which was indeed a painful and pitiable spectacle to
   me. They no doubt deserved the severest punishment, but I always rather
   desired that they might live in prosperity, and continue safe and
   untouched; which would have been the case had they not been altogether
   incorrigible, and obstinately refused to listen to wholesome
   admonition. The trial of these five years was grievous and hard to
   bear; but I experienced not less excruciating pain from the malignity
   of those who ceased not to assail myself and my ministry with their
   envenomed calumnies. A great proportion of them, it is true, are so
   blinded by a passion for slander and detraction, that to their great
   disgracers they betray at once their impudence, while others, however
   crafty and cunning, cannot so cover or disguise themselves as to escape
   being shamefully convicted and disgraced; yet when a man has been a
   hundred times found innocent of a charge brought against him, and when
   the charge is again repeated without any cause or occasion, it is an
   indignity hard to bear. Because I affirm and maintain that the world is
   managed and governed by the secret providence of God, a multitude of
   presumptuous men rise lip against me, and allege that I represent God
   as the author of sin. This is so foolish a calumny, that it would of
   itself quickly come to nothing, did it not meet with persons who have
   tickled ears, and who take pleasure in feeding upon such discourse. But
   there are many whose minds are so filled with envy and spleen, or
   ingratitude, or malignity, that there is no falsehood, however
   preposterous, yea, even monstrous, which they do not receive, if it is
   spoken to them. Others endeavor to overthrow God's eternal purpose of
   predestination, by which he distinguishes between the reprobate and the
   elect; others take upon them to defend free will; and forthwith many
   throw themselves into their ranks, not so much through ignorance as by
   a perversity of zeal which I know not how to characterise. If they were
   open and avowed enemies who brought these troubles upon me, the thing
   might in some way be borne. But that those who shroud themselves under
   the name of brethren, and not only eat Christ's sacred bread, but also
   administer it to others, that those, in short, who loudly boast of
   being preachers of the gospel, should wage such nefarious war against
   me, how detestable is it? In this matter I may very justly complain
   with David,

   "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my
   bread,
   hath lifted up his heel against me," (Psalm 41:9.)

   "For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
   but it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
   We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in
   company,"
   (Psalm 55:12, 13, 14.)

   Others circulated ridiculous reports concerning my treasures; others,
   of the extravagant authority and enormous influence which they say I
   possess; others speak of my delicacies and magnificence. But when a man
   is content with scanty food and common clothing and does not require
   from the humblest more frugality than he shows and practices himself,
   shall it be said that such an one is too sumptuous, and lives in too
   high a style? As to the power and influence of which they envy me, I
   wish I could discharge this burden upon them; for they estimate my
   power by the multitude of affairs, and the vast weight of labors with
   which I am overwhelmed. And if there are some whom I cannot persuade
   whilst I am alive that I am not rich, my death at length will prove it.
   I confess, indeed, that I am not poor; for I desire nothing more than
   what I have. All these are invented stories, and there is no color
   whatever for any one of them; but many nevertheless are very easily
   persuaded of their truth, and applaud them; and the reason is, because
   the greatest part judge that the only means of cloaking their
   enormities is to throw all things into disorder, and to confound black
   and white; and they think that the best and shortest way by which they
   can obtain full liberty to live with impunity just as they please, is
   to destroy the authority of Christ's servants. In addition to these,
   there are "the hypocritical mockers in feasts," of whom David
   complains, (Psalm 35:16;) and I mean by these not only lick-dish
   characters who seek a meal to fill their belly, [17] but all those who
   by false reports seek to obtain the favor of the great. Having been
   long accustomed to swallow such wrongs as these, I have become almost
   hardened; yet when the insolence of such characters increased I cannot
   but sometimes feel my heart wounded with bitter pangs. Nor was it
   enough that I should be so inhumanly treated by my neighbors. In
   addition to this, in a distant country towards the frozen ocean, there
   was raised I know not how, by the frenzy of a few, a storm which
   afterwards stirred up against me a vast number of persons, who are too
   much at leisure, and have nothing to do but by their bickering to
   hinder those who are laboring for the edification of the Church. [18] I
   am still speaking of the internal enemies of the Church--of those who,
   boasting mightily of the gospel of Christ, nevertheless rush against me
   with greater impetuosity than against the open adversaries of the
   Church, because I do not embrace their gross and fictitious notion
   concerning a carnal way of eating Christ in the sacrament; and of whom
   I may protest, after the example of David, "I am for peace; but when I
   speak, they are for war," (Psalm 120:7.) Moreover, the cruel
   ingratitude of all of them is manifest in this, that they scruple not
   to assail both in flank and rear a man who strenuously exerts himself
   to maintain a cause which they have in common with him and whom
   therefore they ought to aid and succor. Certainly, if such persons were
   possessed of even a small portion of humanity, the fury of the Papists
   which is directed against me with such unbridled violence, would
   appease the most implacable animosity which they may bear towards me.
   But since the condition of David was such, that though he had deserved
   well of his own people, he was nevertheless bitterly hated by many
   without a cause, as he complains in Psalm 69:4, "I restored that which
   I took not away," it afforded me no small consolation when I was
   groundlessly assailed by the hatred of those who ought to have assisted
   and solaced me, to conform myself to the example of so great and so
   excellent a person. This knowledge and experience have been of much
   service in enabling me to understand The Psalms, so that in my
   meditations upon them, I did not wander, as it were, in an unknown
   region. My readers, too, if I mistake not, will observe, that in
   unfolding the internal affections both of David and of others I
   discourse upon them as matters of which I have familiar experience.
   Moreover, since I have labored faithfully to open up this treasure for
   the use of all the people of God, although what I have done has not
   been equal to my wishes, yet the attempt which I have made deserves to
   be received with some measure of favor. Still I only ask that each may
   judge of my labors with justice and candour, according to the advantage
   and fruit which he shall derive from them. Certainly, as I have said
   before, in reading these Commentaries, it will be clearly seen that I
   have not sought to please, unless in so far as I might at the same time
   be profitable to others. And, therefore, I have not only observed
   throughout a simple style of teaching, but in order to be removed the
   farther from all ostentation, I have also generally abstained from
   refuting the opinions of others, although this presented a more
   favorable opportunity for plausible display, and of acquiring the
   applause of those who shall favor my book with a perusal. I have never
   touched upon opposite opinions, unless where there was reason to fear,
   that by being silent respecting them, I might leave my readers in doubt
   and perplexity. At the same time, I am sensible that it would have been
   much more agreeable to the taste of many, had I heaped together a great
   mass of materials which has great show, and acquires fame for the
   writer; but I have felt nothing to be of more importance than to have a
   regard to the edification of the Church. May God, who has implanted
   this desire in my heart, grant by his grace that the success may
   correspond thereto!

   Commentary

   upon the book of Psalms

   PSALM 1.

   He who collected the Psalms into one volume, whether Ezra or some other
   person, appears to have placed this Psalm at the beginning, by way of
   preface, in which he inculcates upon all the godly the duty of
   meditating upon the law of God. The sum and substance of the whole is,
   that they are blessed who apply their hearts to the pursuit of heavenly
   wisdom; whereas the profane despisers of God, although for a time they
   may reckon themselves happy, shall at length have a most miserable end.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 1:1-2

   1. Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
   nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
   scorner. 2. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; and in his law
   doth he meditate day and night.


   1. Blessed is the man. [19] The meaning of the Psalmist, as I have
   stated above, is, that it shall be always well with God's devout
   servants, whose constant endeavor it is to make progress in the study
   of his law. The greater part of mankind being accustomed to deride the
   conduct of the saints as mere simplicity, and to regard their labor as
   entirely thrown away, it was of importance that the righteous should be
   confirmed in the way of holiness, by the consideration of the miserable
   condition of all men without the blessing of God, and the conviction
   that God is favorable to none but those who zealously devote themselves
   to the study of divine truth. Moreover, as corruption has always
   prevailed in the world, to such a degree, that the general character of
   men's lives is nothing else but a continual departure from the law of
   God, the Psalmist, before asserting the blessedness of the students of
   the divine law, admonishes them to beware of being carried away by the
   ungodliness of the multitude around them. Commencing with a declaration
   of his abhorrence of the wicked, he teaches us how impossible it is for
   any one to apply his mind to meditation upon God's laws who has not
   first withdrawn and separated himself from the society of the ungodly.
   A needful admonition surely; for we see how thoughtlessly men will
   throw themselves into the snares of Satan; at least, how few
   comparatively there are who guard against the enticements of sin. That
   we may be fully apprised of our danger, it is necessary to remember
   that the world is fraught with deadly corruption, and that the first
   step to living well is to renounce the company of the ungodly,
   otherwise it is sure to infect us with its own pollution.

   As the prophet, in the first place, enjoins the godly to beware of
   temptations to evil, we shall follow the same order. His affirmation,
   that they are blessed who have no fellowship with the ungodly, is what
   the common feeling and opinion of mankind will scarcely admit; for
   while all men naturally desire and seek after happiness, we see how
   securely they can indulge themselves in their sins, yea, that those of
   them who have departed farthest from righteousness, in the
   gratification of their lusts, are accounted happy, because they obtain
   the desires of their heart. The prophet, on the contrary, here teaches
   that no man can be duly animated to the fear and service of God, and to
   the study of his law, until he is firmly persuaded that all the ungodly
   are miserable, and that they who do not withdraw from their company
   shall he involved in the same destruction with them. But as it is no
   easy matter to shun the ungodly with whom we are mingled in the world,
   so as to be wholly estranged from them, the Psalmist, in order to give
   the greater emphasis to his exhortation, employs a multiplicity of
   expressions.

   In the first place, he forbids us to walk in their counsel; in the
   second place, to stand in their way; and, lastly, to sit in their seat.

   The sum of the whole is, that the servants of God must endeavor utterly
   to abhor the life of ungodly men. But as it is the policy of Satan to
   insinuate his deceits, in a very crafty way, the prophet, in order that
   none may be insensibly deceived, shows how by little and little men are
   ordinarily induced to turn aside from the right path. They do not, at
   the first step, advance so far as a proud contempt of God but having
   once begun to give ear to evil counsel, Satan leads them, step by step,
   farther astray, till they rush headlong into open transgression. The
   prophet, therefore, begins with counsel, by which term I understand the
   wickedness which does not as yet show itself openly. Then he speaks of
   the way, which is to be understood of the customary mode or manner of
   living. And he places at the top of the climax the seat, by which
   metaphorical expression he designates the obduracy produced by the
   habit of a sinful life. In the same way, also, ought the three phrases,
   to walk, to stand, and to sit, to be understood. When a person
   willingly walks after the gratification of his corrupt lusts, the
   practice of sinning so infatuates him, that, forgetful of himself, he
   grows hardened in wickedness; and this the prophet terms standing in
   the way of sinners. Then at length follows a desperate obstinacy, which
   he expresses by the figure of sitting. Whether there is the same
   gradation in the Hebrew words rsym, reshaim, cht'ym, chataim, and
   ltsym, letsim, that is to say, a gradual increase of evil, I leave to
   the judgment of others. [20] To me it does not appear that there is,
   unless perhaps in the last word. For those are called scorners who,
   having thrown off all fear of God, commit sin without restraint, in the
   hope of escaping unpunished, and without compunction or fear sport at
   the judgment of God, as if they would never be called to render up an
   account to him. The Hebrew word cht'ym, chataim, as it signifies the
   openly wicked, is very properly joined with the term way, which
   signifies a professed and habitual manner of living. [21] And if, in
   the time of the Psalmist, it was necessary for the devout worshippers
   of God to withdraw themselves from the company of the ungodly, in order
   to frame their life aright, how much more in the present day, when the
   world has become so much more corrupt, ought we carefully to avoid all
   dangerous society that we may be kept unstained by its impurities. The
   prophet, however, not only commands the faithful to keep at a distance
   from the ungodly, from the dread of being infected by them, but his
   admonition farther implies, that every one should be careful not to
   corrupt himself, nor abandon himself to impiety. [22] A man may not
   have contracted defilement from evil examples, and yet come to resemble
   the wicked by spontaneously imitating their corrupt manners.

   In the second verse, the Psalmist does not simply pronounce those happy
   who fear God, as in other places, but designates godliness by the study
   of the law, teaching us that God is only rightly served when his law is
   obeyed. It is not left to every man to frame a system of religion
   according to his own judgment, but the standard of godliness is to be
   taken from the Word of God. When David here speaks of the law, it ought
   not to be understood as if the other parts of Scripture should be
   excluded, but rather, since the whole of Scripture is nothing else than
   an exposition of the law, under it as the head is comprehended the
   whole body. The prophet, therefore, in commending the law, includes all
   the rest of the inspired writings. He must, therefore, be understood as
   meaning to exhort the faithful to the reading of the Psalms also. From
   his characterising the godly as delighting in the law of the Lord, we
   may learn that forced or servile obedience is not at all acceptable to
   God, and that those only are worthy students of the law who come to it
   with a cheerful mind, and are so delighted with its instructions, as to
   account nothing more desirable or delicious than to make progress
   therein. From this love of the law proceeds constant meditation upon
   it, which the prophet mentions on the last clause of the verse; for all
   who are truly actuated by love to the law must feel pleasure in the
   diligent study of it.

   Psalm 1:3

   3. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that
   bringeth his fruit in his season; whose leaf shall not wither; and
   whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.


   The Psalmist here illustrates, and, at the same time, confirms by a
   metaphor the statement made in the preceding verse; for he shows in
   what respect those who fear God are to be accounted happy, namely, not
   because they enjoy an evanescent and empty gladness, but because they
   are in a desirable condition. There is in the words an implied contrast
   between the vigor of a tree planted in a situation well watered, and
   the decayed appearance of one which, although it may flourish
   beautifully for a time, yet soon withers on account of the barrenness
   of the soil in which it is placed. With respect to the ungodly, as we
   shall afterwards see, (Psalm 37:35) they are sometimes like "the cedars
   of Lebanon." They have such an overflowing abundance of wealth and
   honors, that nothing seems wanting to their present happiness. But
   however high they may be raised, and however far and wide they may
   spread their branches, yet having no root in the ground, nor even a
   sufficiency of moisture from which they may derive nourishment, the
   whole of their beauty by and by disappears, and withers away. It is,
   therefore, the blessing of God alone which preserves any in a
   prosperous condition. Those who explain the figure of the faithful
   bringing forth their fruit in season, as meaning that they wisely
   discern when a thing ought to be done so as to be done well, in my
   opinion, show more acuteness than judgment, by putting a meaning upon
   the words of the prophet which he never intended. He obviously meant
   nothing more than that the children of God constantly flourish, and are
   always watered with the secret influences of divine grace, so that
   whatever may befall them is conducive to their salvation; while, on the
   other hand, the ungodly are carried away by the sudden tempest, or
   consumed by the scorching heat. And when he says, he bringeth forth his
   fruit in season, [23] he expresses the full maturity of the fruit
   produced, whereas, although the ungodly may present the appearance of
   precocious fruitfulness, yet they produce nothing that comes to
   perfection.

   Psalm 1:4

   4. The ungodly are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind
   driveth away.


   The Psalmist might, with propriety, have compared the ungodly to a tree
   that speedily withers, as Jeremiah likens them to the heath which grows
   in the wilderness, (Jeremiah 17:6) But not reckoning this figure
   sufficiently strong, he debases them by employing another, which
   represents them in a light still more contemptible: and the reason is,
   that he does not keep his eye on the prosperous condition of which they
   boast for a short time, but his mind is seriously pondering on the
   destruction which awaits them, and will at length overtake them. The
   meaning, therefore, is, although the ungodly now live prosperously, yet
   by and by they shall be like chaff; for when the Lord has brought them
   low, he shall drive them hither and thither with the blast of his
   wrath. Besides, by this form of speech, the Holy Spirit teaches us to
   contemplate with the eye of faith, what might otherwise seem
   incredible; for although the ungodly man rise high, and appear to great
   advantage, like a stately tree, we may rest assured that he will be
   even as chaff or refuse, whenever God chooses to cast him down from his
   high estate, with the breath of his mouth.

   Psalm 1:5-6

   5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
   in the congregation of the righteous. 6. For Jehovah knoweth the way of
   the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.


   In the fifth verse, the prophet teaches that a happy life depends on a
   good conscience, and that, therefore, it is not wonderful, if the
   ungodly suddenly fall from the happiness of which they fancied
   themselves in possession. And there is implied in the words a kind of
   concession; the prophet tacitly acknowledges that the ungodly please
   and enjoy themselves, and triumph during the reign of moral disorder in
   the world; just as robbers revel in the woods and caves, when beyond
   the reach of justice. But he assures us, that things will not always
   remain in their present state of confusion, and that when they shall
   have been reduced to proper order, these ungodly persons shall be
   entirely deprived of their pleasures, and feel that they were
   infatuated when they thought themselves happy. We now see how the
   Psalmist pronounces the ungodly to be miserable, because happiness is
   the inward blessing of a good conscience. He does not deny, that before
   they are driven to judgment, all things succeed well with them; but he
   denies that they are happy unless they have substantial and steadfast
   integrity of character to sustain them: for the true integrity of the
   righteous manifests itself when it comes at length to be tried. It is
   indeed true, that the Lord daily executes judgment, by making a
   distinction between the righteous and the wicked, but because this is
   done only partially in this life, we must look higher if we desire to
   behold the assembly of the righteous, of which mention is here made.

   Even in this world the prosperity of the ungodly begins to pass away as
   often as God manifests the tokens of his judgment; (for then, being
   awakened out of sleep, they are constrained to acknowledge, whether
   they will or no, that they have no part with the assembly of the
   righteous;) but because this is not accomplished always, nor with
   respect to all men, in the present state, we must patiently wait for
   the day of final revelation, in which Christ will separate the sheep
   from the goats. At the same time, we must maintain it as a general
   truth, that the ungodly are devoted to misery; for their own
   consciences condemn them for their wickedness; and, as often as they
   are summoned to give an account of their life, their sleep is broken,
   and they perceive that they were merely dreaming when they imagined
   themselves to be happy, without looking inward to the true state of
   their hearts.

   Moreover, as things appear to be here driven about at the mercy of
   chance, and as it is not easy for us, in the midst of the prevailing
   confusion, to acknowledge the truth of what the Psalmist had said, he
   therefore presents to our consideration the grand principle, that God
   is the Judge of the world. Granting this, it follows that it cannot but
   be well with the upright and the just, while, on the other hand, the
   most terrible destruction must impend over the ungodly. According to
   all outward appearance, the servants of God may derive no advantage
   from their uprightness; but as it is the peculiar office of God to
   defend them and take care of their safety, they must be happy under his
   protection. And from this we may also conclude that, as he is the
   certain avenger of wickedness, although, for a time, he may seem to
   take no notice of the ungodly, yet at length he will visit them with
   destruction. Instead, therefore, of allowing ourselves to be deceived
   with their imaginary felicity, let us, in circumstances of distress,
   have ever before our eyes the providence of God, to whom it belongs to
   settle the affairs of the world, and to bring order out of confusion.

   PSALM 2

   David boasts that his kingdom, though assailed by a vast multitude of
   powerful enemies, would, notwithstanding, be perpetual, because it was
   upheld by the hand and power of God. He adds, that in spite of his
   enemies, it would be extended even to the uttermost ends of the earth.
   And, therefore, he exhorts kings and other rulers to lay aside their
   pride, and receive, with submissive minds, the yoke laid upon them by
   God; as it would be vain for them to attempt to shake it off. All this
   was typical and contains a prophecy concerning the future kingdom of
   Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 2:1-3

   1. Why do the nations rise tumultuously, and the peoples murmur in
   vain? 2. The kings of the earth have confederated, and the princes have
   assembled together, against Jehovah and against his Christ. 3. Let us
   break of their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us.


   WE know how many conspired against David, and endeavored to prevent his
   coming to the throne, and from their hostile attempts, had he judged
   according to the eye of sense and reason, he might have been so full of
   apprehension, as forthwith to have given up all hope of ever becoming
   king. And, doubtless, he had often to struggle sorrowfully with very
   grievous temptations. But, as he had the testimony of an approving
   conscience, that he had attempted nothing rashly nor acted as ambition
   and depraved desire impel many to seek changes in the government of
   kingdoms; as he was, on the contrary, thoroughly persuaded that he had
   been made king by divine appointment, when he coveted no such thing,
   nor even thought of it; [24] he encouraged himself by strong confidence
   in God against the whole world, just as in these words, he nobly pours
   contempt both on kings and their armies. He confesses, indeed, that he
   had a sore battle to fight, inasmuch as it was no small party, but
   whole nations with their kings, who had conspired against him; but he
   courageously boasts that their attempts were vain, because they waged
   war, not against mortal man, but against God himself. It is not certain
   from the words, whether he speaks only of enemies in his own kingdom,
   or extends his complaints to foreign invaders. But, since the fact was,
   that enemies rose up against him in all quarters, and that as soon as
   he had settled the disturbances among his own people, the neighboring
   states, in their turn, became hostile to him, I am disposed to think
   that both classes of enemies are meant, Gentiles as well as Jews. It
   would be a strange mode of expression to speak of many nations and
   people when only one nation was meant, and to speak of many kings when
   he had in eye Saul only. Besides, it agrees better with the
   completeness of the type to suppose that different kinds of enemies
   were joined together; for we know that Christ had not only to do with
   enemies in his own country, but likewise with enemies in other nations;
   the whole world having entered into a common conspiracy to accomplish
   his destruction. The Jews, indeed, first began to rage against Christ
   as they had formerly done against David; but afterwards the same
   species of madness seized upon other nations. The sum is, that although
   those who endeavored to overthrow him might be strengthened by powerful
   armies, yet their tumults and counsels would prove vain and
   ineffectual.

   By attributing to the people commotion and uproar, and to kings and
   rulers the holding of assemblies, to take counsel, he has used very
   appropriate language. Yet he intimates that, when kings have long and
   much consulted together, and the people have poured forth their utmost
   fury, all of them united would make nothing of it. But we ought
   carefully to mark the ground of such confidence, which was, that he had
   not thrust himself forward to be king rashly, or of his own accord, but
   only followed the call of God. From this he concludes, that in his
   person God was assailed; and God could not but show himself the
   defender of the kingdom of which he was the founder. By honoring
   himself with the title of Messias, or the Anointed, he declares that he
   reigned only by the authority and command of God, inasmuch as the oil
   brought by the hand of Samuel made him king who before was only a
   private person. David's enemies did not, indeed, think they were making
   a violent attack against God, yea, they would resolutely deny their
   having any such intention; yet it is not without reason that David
   places God in opposition to them, and speaks as if they directly
   levelled their attacks against him, for by seeking to undermine the
   kingdom which he had erected, they blindly and ferociously waged war
   against Him. If all those are rebels against God who resist the powers
   ordained by him, much more does this apply to that sacred kingdom which
   was established by special privilege.

   But it is now high time to come to the substance of the type. That
   David prophesied concerning Christ, is clearly manifest from this, that
   he knew his own kingdom to be merely a shadow. And in order to learn to
   apply to Christ whatever David, in times past, sang concerning himself,
   we must hold this principle, which we meet with everywhere in all the
   prophets, that he, with his posterity, was made king, not so much for
   his own sake as to be a type of the Redeemer. We shall often have
   occasion to return to this afterwards, but at present I would briefly
   inform my readers that as David's temporal kingdom was a kind of
   earnest to God's ancient people of the eternal kingdom, which at length
   was truly established in the person of Christ, those things which David
   declares concerning himself are not violently, or even allegorically,
   applied to Christ, but were truly predicted concerning him. If we
   attentively consider the nature of the kingdom, we will perceive that
   it would be absurd to overlook the end or scope, and to rest in the
   mere shadow. That the kingdom of Christ is here described by the spirit
   of prophecy, is sufficiently attested to us by the apostles, who,
   seeing the ungodly conspiring against Christ, arm themselves in prayer
   with this doctrine, (Acts 4:24.) But to place our faith beyond the
   reach of all cavils, it is plainly made manifest from all the prophets,
   that those things which David testified concerning his own kingdom are
   properly applicable to Christ. Let this, therefore, be held as a
   settled point, that all who do not submit themselves to the authority
   of Christ make war against God. Since it seems good to God to rule us
   by the hand of his own Son, those who refuse to obey Christ himself
   deny the authority of God, and it is in vain for them to profess
   otherwise. For it is a true saying,

   "He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the
   Father which hath sent him," (John 5:22.)

   And it is of great importance to hold fast this inseparable connection,
   that as the majesty of God hath shone forth in his only begotten Son,
   so the Father will not be feared and worshipped but in his person.

   A twofold consolation may be drawn from this passage:-- First, as often
   as the world rages, in order to disturb and put an end to the
   prosperity of Christ's kingdom, we have only to remember that, in all
   this there is just a fulfillment of what was long ago predicted, and no
   changes that can happen will greatly disquiet us. Yea, rather it will
   be highly profitable to us to compare those things which the apostles
   experienced with what we witness at the present time. Of itself the
   kingdom of Christ would be peaceable, and from it true peace issues
   forth to the world; but through the wickedness and malice of men, never
   does it rise from obscurity into open view without disturbances being
   excited. Nor is it at all wonderful, or unusual, if the world begin to
   rage as soon as a throne is erected for Christ. The other consolation
   which follows is, that when the ungodly have mustered their forces, and
   when, depending on their vast numbers, their riches, and their means of
   defense, they not only pour forth their proud blasphemies, but
   furiously assault heaven itself, we may safely laugh them to scorn,
   relying on this one consideration, that he whom they are assailing is
   the God who is in heaven. When we see Christ well nigh overwhelmed with
   the number and strength of his enemies, let us remember that they are
   making war against God over whom they shall not prevail, and therefore
   their attempts, whatever they may be, and however increasing, will come
   to naught, and be utterly ineffectual. Let us learn, farther, that this
   doctrine runs through the whole gospel; for the prayer of the apostles
   which I have just quoted, manifestly testifies that it ought not to be
   restricted to the person of Christ.

   3. Let us break, etc. This is a prosopopoeia, [25] in which the prophet
   introduces his-enemies as speaking; and he employs this figure the
   better to express their ungodly and traitorous design. Not that they
   openly avowed themselves rebels against God, (for they rather covered
   their rebellion under every possible pretext, and presumptuously
   boasted of having God on their side;) but since they were fully
   determined, by all means, fair or foul, to drive David from the throne,
   whatever they professed with the mouth, the whole of their consultation
   amounted to this, how they might overthrow the kingdom which God
   himself had set up. When he describes his government under the
   metaphorical expressions of bonds, and a yoke, on the persons of his
   adversaries, he indirectly condemns their pride. For he represents them
   speaking scornfully of his government, as if to submit to it were a
   slavish and shameful subjection, just as we see it is with all the
   enemies of Christ who, when compelled to be subject to his authority
   reckon it not less degrading than if the utmost disgrace were put upon
   them.

   Psalm 2:4-6

   4. He who dwelleth in heaven will laugh at them; the Lord [26] will
   have them in derision. 5. Then will he speak to them in his wrath, and
   vex them in his sore displeasure. 6. I have anointed my King upon my
   holy hill of Sion.


   After David has told us of the tumult and commotions, the counsels and
   pride, the preparation and resources the strength and efforts of his
   enemies, in opposition to all these he places the power of God alone,
   which he concludes would be brought to bear against them, from their
   attempting to frustrate his decree. And, as a little before, by terming
   them kings of the earth, he expressed their feeble and perishable
   condition; so now, by the lofty title of He that dwelleth in heaven, he
   extols the power of God, as if he had said, that power remains intact
   and unimpaired, whatever men may attempt against it. Let them exalt
   themselves as they may, they shall never be able to reach to heaven;
   yea, while they think to confound heaven and earth together, they
   resemble so many grasshoppers, and the Lord, meanwhile, undisturbed
   beholds from on high their infatuated evolutions. And David ascribes
   laughter to God on two accounts; first, to teach us that he does not
   stand in need of great armies to repress the rebellion of wicked men,
   as if this were an arduous and difficult matter, but, on the contrary,
   could do this as often as he pleases with the most perfect ease. In the
   second place, he would have us to understand that when God permits the
   reign of his Son to be troubled, he does not cease from interfering
   because he is employed elsewhere, or unable to afford assistance, or
   because he is neglectful of the honor of his Son; but he purposely
   delays the inflictions of his wrath to the proper time, namely, until
   he has exposed their infatuated rage to general derision. Let us,
   therefore, assure ourselves that if God does not immediately stretch
   forth his hand against the ungodly, it is now his time of laughter; and
   although, in the meantime, we ought to weep, yet let us assuage the
   bitterness of our grief, yea, and wipe away our tears, with this
   reflection, that God does not connive at the wickedness of his enemies,
   as if from indolence or feebleness, but because for the time he would
   confront their insolence with quiet contempt. By the adverb then, he
   points to the fit time for exercising judgment, as if he had said,
   after the Lord shall have for a time apparently taken no notice of the
   malpractices of those who oppose the rule of his Son, he will suddenly
   change his course, and show that he retards nothing with greater
   abhorrence than such presumption.

   Moreover, he ascribes speech to God, not for the purpose of instructing
   his enemies, but only to convict them of their madness; indeed, by the
   term speak, he means nothing else than a manifestation of God's wrath,
   which the ungodly do not perceive until they feel it. The enemies of
   David thought it would be the easiest thing in the world for them to
   destroy one who, coming from a mean shepherd's cot, had, in their view,
   [27] presumptuously assumed the sovereign power. The prophecy and
   anointing of Samuel were, in their estimation, mere ridiculous
   pretences. But when God had at length overthrown them, and settled
   David on the throne, he, by this act, spoke not so much with his tongue
   as with his hand, to manifest himself the founder of David's kingdom.
   The Psalmist hereon then, refers to speaking by actions, by which the
   Lord, without uttering a single word, makes manifest his purpose. In
   like manner, whenever he defends the kingdom of his Son against the
   ungodly, by the tokens and inflictions of his wrath, although he does
   not speak a single word, yet in effect he speaks enough to make himself
   understood. [28] David afterwards, speaking in the name of God, shows
   more clearly how his enemies were guilty of wickedly fighting against
   God himself in the hatred which they bore towards him whom God had made
   king. The sum is this: Wicked men may now conduct themselves as
   wickedly as they please, but they shall at length feel what it is to
   make war against heaven. The pronoun I is also emphatical, by which God
   signifies that he is so far exalted above the men of this world, that
   the whole mass of them could not possibly obscure his glory in the
   least degree. As often, then, as the power of man appears formidable to
   us, let us remember how much it is transcended by the power of God. In
   these words there is set before us the unchangeable and eternal purpose
   of God effectually to defend, even to the end, the kingdom of his Son,
   of which he is the founder; and this may well support our faith amidst
   the troublous storms of the world. Whatever plots, therefore, men may
   form against it, let this one consideration be sufficient to satisfy
   us, that they cannot render ineffectual the anointing of God. Mention
   is here made of mount Sion in express terms, not because David was
   first anointed thereon but because at length, in God's own time, the
   truth of the prophecy was manifested and actually established by the
   solemn rite of his consecration. And although David in these words had
   a regard to the promise of God, and recalled the attention of himself
   and others to it, yet, at the same time, he meant to signify that his
   own reign is holy and inseparably connected with the temple of God. But
   this applies more appropriately to the kingdom of Christ, which we know
   to be both spiritual and joined to the priesthood, and this is the
   principal part of the worship of God.

   Psalm 2:7-8

   7. I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my
   Son; this day have I begotten thee. 8. Ask of me, and I will give thee
   the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
   for thy possession.


   7. I will declare, etc. David, to take away all pretense of ignorance
   from his enemies, assumes the office of a preacher in order to publish
   the decree of God; or at least he protests that he did not come to the
   throne without a sure and clear proof of his calling; as if he had
   said, I did not, without consideration, publicly go forward to usurp
   the kingdom, but I brought with me the command of God, without which, I
   would have acted presumptuously, in advancing myself to such an
   honorable station. But this was more truly fulfilled in Christ, and
   doubtless, David, under the influence of the spirit of prophecy, had a
   special reference to him. For in this way all the ungodly are rendered
   inexcusable, because Christ proved himself to have been endued with
   lawful power from God, not only by his miracles, but by the preaching
   of the gospel. In fact, the very same testimony resounds through the
   whole world. The apostles first, and after them pastors and teachers,
   bore testimony that Christ was made King by God the Father; but since
   they acted as ambassadors in Christ's stead, He rightly and properly
   claims to himself alone whatever was done by them. Accordingly, Paul
   (Ephesians 2:17) ascribes to Christ what the ministers of the gospel
   did in his name. "He came," says he, "and preached peace to them that
   were afar off, and to them that were nigh." Hereby, also, the authority
   of the gospel is better established because, although it is published
   by others, it does not cease to be the gospel of Christ. As often
   therefore, as we hear the gospel preached by men, we ought to consider
   that it is not so much they who speak, as Christ who speaks by them.
   And this is a singular advantage, that Christ lovingly allures us to
   himself by his own voice, that we may not by any means doubt of the
   majesty of his kingdom.

   On this account, we ought the more carefully to beware of wickedly
   refusing the edict which he publishes, Thou art my Son. David, indeed
   could with propriety be called the son of God on account of his royal
   dignity, just as we know that princes, because they are elevated above
   others, are called both gods and the sons of God. But here God, by the
   singularly high title with which he honors David, exalts him not only
   above all mortal men, but even above the angels. This the apostle
   (Hebrews 1:5) wisely and diligently considers when he tells us this
   language was never used with respect to any of the angels. David,
   individually considered, was inferior to the angels, but in so far as
   he represented the person of Christ, he is with very good reason
   preferred far above them. By the Son of God in this place we are
   therefore not to understand one son among many, but his only begotten
   Son, that he alone should have the pre-eminence both in heaven and on
   earth. When God says, I have begotten thee, it ought to be understood
   as referring to men's understanding or knowledge of it; for David was
   begotten by God when the choice of him to be king was clearly
   manifested. The words this day, therefore, denote the time of this
   manifestation; for as soon as it became known that he was made king by
   divine appointment, he came forth as one who had been lately begotten
   of God, since so great an honor could not belong to a private person.
   The same explanation is to be given of the words as applied to Christ.
   He is not said to be begotten in any other sense than as the Father
   bore testimony to him as being his own Son. This passage, I am aware,
   has been explained by many as referring to the eternal generation of
   Christ; and from the words this day, they have reasoned ingeniously as
   if they denoted an eternal act without any relation to time. But Paul,
   who is a more faithful and a better qualified interpreter of this
   prophecy, in Acts 13:33, calls our attention to the manifestation of
   the heavenly glory of Christ of which I have spoken. This expression,
   to be begotten, does not therefore imply that he then began to be the
   Son of God, but that his being so was then made manifest to the world.
   Finally, this begetting ought not to be understood of the mutual love
   which exists between the Father and the Son; it only signifies that He
   who had been hidden from the beginning in the sacred bosom of the
   Father, and who afterwards had been obscurely shadowed forth under the
   law, was known to be the Son of God from the time when he came forth
   with authentic and evident marks of Sonship, according to what is said
   in John 1:14, "we have seen his glory, as of the only begotten of the
   Father." We must, at the same time, however, bear in mind what Paul
   teaches, (Romans 1:4) that he was declared to be the Son of God with
   power when he rose again from the dead, and therefore what is here said
   has a principal allusion to the day of his resurrection. But to
   whatever particular time the allusion may be, the Holy Spirit here
   points out the solemn and proper time of his manifestation, just as he
   does afterwards in these words

   "This is the day which the Lord hath made;
   we will rejoice and be glad in it." (Psalm 118:24)

   8. Ask of me. Christ, it is true, besought his Father (John 17:5) to
   "glorify him with the glory which he had with him before the world
   was;" yet the more obvious meaning is, that the Father will deny
   nothing to his Son which relates to the extension of his kingdom to the
   uttermost ends of the earth. But, in this wonderful matter, Christ is
   introduced as presenting himself before the Father with prayers, in
   order to illustrate the free liberality of God in conferring upon men
   the honor of constituting his own Son governor over the whole world. As
   the eternal Word of God, Christ, it is true, has always had in his
   hands by right sovereign authority and majesty, and as such can receive
   no accessions thereto; but still he is exalted in human nature, in
   which he took upon him the form of a servant. This title, therefore, is
   not applied to him only as God, but is extended to the whole person of
   the Mediator; for after Christ had emptied himself there was given to
   him a name which is above every name, that before him every knee should
   bow, (Philippians 2:9) David, as we know, after having obtained signal
   victories reigned over a large extent of territory, so that many
   nations became tributaries to him; but what is here said was not
   fulfilled in him. If we compare his kingdom with other monarchies it
   was confined within very narrow boundaries. Unless, therefore, we
   suppose this prophecy concerning the vast extent of kingdom to have
   been uttered in vain and falsely, we must apply it to Christ, who alone
   has subdued the whole world to himself and embraced all lands and
   nations under his dominion. Accordingly, here, as in many other places,
   the calling of the Gentiles is foretold, to prevent all from imagining
   that the Redeemer who was to be sent of God was king of one nation
   only. And if we now see his kingdom divided, diminished, and broken
   down, this proceeds from the wickedness of men, which renders them
   unworthy of being under a reign so happy and so desirable. But although
   the ingratitude of men hinders the kingdom of Christ from prospering it
   does not render this prediction of none effect, inasmuch as Christ
   collects the dispersed remnants of his people from all quarters, and in
   the midst of this wretched desolation, keeps them joined together by
   the sacred bond of faiths so that not one corner only, but the whole
   world is subjected to his authority. Besides, however insolently the
   ungodly may act, and however they may reject his sovereignty, they
   cannot, by their rebellion, destroy his authority and power. To this
   subject also belongs what immediately follows:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 2:9

   9. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces
   like a potter's vessel.


   This is expressly stated to teach us that Christ is furnished with
   power by which to reign even over those who are averse to his
   authority, and refuse to obey him. The language of David implies that
   all will not voluntarily receive his yoke, but that many will be
   stiff-necked and rebellious, whom notwithstanding he shall subdue by
   force, and compel to submit to him. It is true, the beauty and glory of
   the kingdom of which David speaks are more illustriously displayed when
   a willing people run to Christ in the day of his power, to show
   themselves his obedient subjects; but as the greater part of men rise
   up against him with a violence which spurns all restraint, it was
   necessary to add the truth, that this king would prove himself superior
   to all such opposition. Of this unconquerable power in war God
   exhibited a specimen, primarily in the person of David, who, as we
   know, vanquished and overthrew many enemies by force of arms. But the
   prediction is more fully verified in Christ, who, neither by sword nor
   spear, but by the breath of his mouth, smites the ungodly even to their
   utter destruction.

   It may, however, seem wonderful that, while the prophets in other parts
   of Scripture celebrate the meekness, the mercy, and the gentleness of
   our Lord, he is here described as so rigorous, austere, and full of
   terror. But this severe and dreadful sovereignty is set before us for
   no other purpose than to strike alarm into his enemies; and it is not
   at all inconsistent with the kindness with which Christ tenderly and
   sweetly cherishes his own people. He who shows himself a loving
   shepherd to his gentle sheep, must treat the wild beasts with a degree
   of severity either to convert them from their cruelty, or effectually
   to restrain it. Accordingly in Psalm 110:5, after a commendation is
   pronounced upon the obedience of the godly, Christ is immediately armed
   with power to destroy, in the day of his wrath, kings and their armies
   who are hostile to him. And certainly both these characters are with
   propriety ascribed to him: for he was sent by the Father to cheer the
   poor and the wretched with the tidings of salvation, to set the
   prisoners free, to heal the sick, to bring the sorrowful and afflicted
   out of the darkness of death into the light of life, (Isaiah 61:1) and
   as, on the other hand, many by their ingratitude, provoke his wrath
   against them, he assumes, as it were, a new character, to beat down
   their obduracy. It may be asked, what is that iron scepter which the
   Father hath put into the hand of Christ, wherewith to break in pieces
   his enemies? I answer, The breath of his mouth supplies to him the
   place of all other weapons, as I have just now shown from Isaiah.
   Although, therefore, Christ move not a finger, yet by his speaking he
   thunders awfully enough against his enemies, and destroys them by the
   rod of his mouth alone. They may fret and kick, and with the rage of a
   madman resist him never so much, but they shall at length be compelled
   to feel that he whom they refuse to honor as their king is their judge.
   In short, they are broken in pieces by various methods, till they
   become his footstool. In what respect the doctrine of the gospel is an
   iron rod, may be gathered from Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, (2
   Corinthians 10:4) where he teaches that the ministers of Christ are
   furnished with spiritual weapons to cast down every high thing which
   exalteth itself against Christ, etc. I allow that even the faithful
   themselves may be offered in sacrifice to God, that he may quicken them
   by his grace, for it is meet we should be humbled in the dust, before
   Christ stretch forth his hand to save us. But Christ trains his
   disciples to repentance in such a way as not to appear terrible to
   them; on the contrary, by showing them his shepherd's rod, he quickly
   turns their sorrow into joy; and so far is he from using his iron rod
   to break them in pieces, that he rather protects them under the healing
   shadow of his hand, and upholds them by his power. When David speaks,
   therefore, of breaking and bruising, this applies only to the
   rebellious and unbelieving who submit to Christ, not because they have
   been subdued by repentance, but because they are overwhelmed with
   despair. Christ does not, indeed, literally speak to all men; but as he
   denounces in his word whatever judgments he executes upon them, he may
   be truly said to slay the ungodly man with the breath of his mouth, (2
   Thessalonians 2:8.) The Psalmist exposes to shame their foolish pride
   by a beautiful similitude; teaching us, that although their obstinacy
   is harder than the stones, they are yet more fragile than earthen
   vessels. Since, however, we do not see the enemies of the Redeemer
   immediately broken in pieces, but, on the contrary, the Church herself
   appears rather to be like the frail earthen vessel under their iron
   hammered the godly need to be admonished to regard the judgments which
   Christ daily executes as presages of the terrible ruin which remains
   for all the ungodly, and to wait patiently for the last day, when he
   will utterly consume them by the flaming fire in which he will come. In
   the meantime, let us rest satisfied that he "rules in the midst of his
   enemies.â

   Psalm 2:10-11

   10. And now, O ye kings, be wise; and ye judges of the earth be
   instructed. 11. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.


   David having, as a preacher of the judgments of God, set forth the
   vengeance which God would take upon his enemies proceeds now, in the
   character of a prophet and teacher, to exhort the unbelieving to
   repentance, that they may not, when it is too late, be compelled to
   acknowledge, from dire experience, that the divine threatenings are
   neither idle nor ineffectual. And he addresses by name kings and
   rulers, who are not very easily brought to a submissive state of mind,
   and who are, besides, prevented from learning what is right by the
   foolish conceit of their own wisdom with which they are puffed up. And
   if David spare not even kings themselves, who seem unrestrained by
   laws, and exempted from ordinary rules, much more does his exhortation
   apply to the common class of men, in order that all, from the highest
   to the lowest, may humble themselves before God. By the adverb now, he
   signifies the necessity of their speedy repentance, since they will not
   always be favored with the like opportunity. Meanwhile, he tacitly
   gives them to understand, that it was for their advantage that he
   warned them, as there was yet room for repentance provided they made
   haste. When he enjoins them to be wise, he indirectly condemns their
   false confidence in their own wisdom as if he had said, The beginning
   of true wisdom is when a man lays aside his pride, and submits himself
   to the authority of Christ. Accordingly, however good an opinion the
   princes of the world may have of their own shrewdness, we may be sure
   they are arrant fools till they become humble scholars at the feet of
   Christ. Moreover, he declares the manner in which they were to be wise,
   by commanding them to serve the Lord with fear. By trusting to their
   elevated station, they flatter themselves that they are loosed from the
   laws which bind the rest of mankind; and the pride of this so greatly
   blinds them as to make them think it beneath them to submit even to
   God. The Psalmist therefore, tells them, that until they have learned
   to fear him, they are destitute of all right understanding. And
   certainly, since they are so much hardened by security as to withdraw
   their obedience from God, strong measures must at the first be employed
   to bring them to fear him, and thus to recover them from their
   rebelliousness. To prevent them from supposing that the service to
   which he calls them is grievous, he teaches them by the word rejoice
   how pleasant and desirable it is, since it furnishes matter of true
   gladness. But lest they should, according to their usual way, wax
   wanton, and, intoxicated with vain pleasures, imagine themselves happy
   while they are enemies to God, he exhorts them farther by the words
   with fear to an humble and dutiful submission. There is a great
   difference between the pleasant and cheerful state of a peaceful
   conscience, which the faithful enjoy in having the favor of God, whom
   they fear, and the unbridled insolence to which the wicked are carried,
   by contempt and forgetfulness of God. The language of the prophet,
   therefore, implies, that so long as the proud profligately rejoice in
   the gratification of the lusts of the flesh, they sport with their own
   destruction, while, on the contrary, the only true and salutary joy is
   that which arises from resting in the fear and reverence of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 2:12

   12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when
   [29] his wrath is kindled in a moment. O blessed are all who put their
   trust in him.


   David expresses yet more distinctly what kind of fear and service God
   requires. Since it is the will of God to reign by the hand of his Son,
   and since he has engraved on his person the marks and insignia of his
   own glory, the proper proof of our obedience and piety towards him is
   reverently to embrace his Son, whom he has appointed king over us,
   according to the declaration,

   "He that honoureth not the Son,
   honoureth not the Father who hath sent him," (John 5:23)

   The term kiss refers to the solemn token or sign of honor which
   subjects were wont to yield to their sovereigns. The sum is, that God
   is defrauded of his honor if he is not served in Christ. The Hebrew
   word vr Bar, signifies both a son and an elect person; but in whatever
   way you take it, the meaning will remain the same. Christ was truly
   chosen of the Father, who has given him all power, that he alone should
   stand pre-eminent above both men and angels. On which account also he
   is said to be "sealed" by God, (John 6:27) because a peculiar dignity
   was conferred upon him, which removes him to a distance from all
   creatures. Some interpreters expound it, kiss or embrace what is pure,
   [30] which is a strange and rather forced interpretation. For my part,
   I willingly retain the name of son, which answers well to a former
   sentence, where it was said, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
   thee."

   What follows immediately after is a warning to those who despise
   Christ, that their pride shall not go unpunished, as if he had said, As
   Christ is not despised without indignity being done to the Father, who
   hath adorned him with his own glory, so the Father himself will not
   allow such an invasion of his sacred rights to pass unpunished. And to
   teach them to beware of vainly deceiving themselves with the hope of a
   lengthened delay, and from their present ease indulging themselves in
   vain pleasures, they are plainly told that his wrath will be kindled in
   a moment. For we see, when God for a time connives at the wicked, and
   bears with them, how they abuse this forbearance, by growing more
   presumptuous, because they do not think of his judgments otherwise,
   than according to sight and feeling. Some interpreters, I know, explain
   the Hebrew word kmt, Camoat, which we have rendered, in a moment, in a
   different way, namely, that as soon as God's wrath is kindled in even a
   small degree, it will be all over with the reprobate. But it is more
   suitable to apply it to time, and to view it as a warning to the proud
   not to harden themselves in their stupidity and indifference, nor
   flatter themselves from the patience of God, with the hope of escaping
   unpunished. Moreover, although this word appears to be put for the
   purpose of giving a reason of what goes before, [31] namely, why those
   who refuse to kiss the Son shall perish, and although the Hebrew word
   ky, ki, signifies more frequently for than when, yet I am unwilling to
   depart from the commonly received translation, and have thought it
   proper to render the original word by the adverb when, which denotes
   both the reason and time of what is predicated. Some explain the
   phrases, to perish from the way, as meaning, a perverse way, or wicked
   manner of listing. Others resolve it thus, lest your way perish,
   according to that saying of the first psalm, the way of the ungodly
   shall perish. But I am rather inclined to attach to the words a
   different meaning, and to view them as a denunciation against the
   ungodly, by which they are warned that the wrath of God will cut them
   off when they think themselves to be only in the middle of their race.
   We know how the despisers of God are accustomed to flatter themselves
   in prosperity, and run to great excess in riot. The prophet, therefore,
   with great propriety, threatens that when they shall say, Peace and
   safety, reckoning themselves at a great distance from their end, they
   shall be cut off by a sudden destruction, (1 Thessalonians 5:3)

   The concluding sentence of the psalm qualifies what was formerly said
   concerning the severity of Christ; for his iron rod and the fiery wrath
   of God would strike terror into all men without distinction, unless
   this comfort had been added. Having, therefore discoursed concerning
   the terrible judgment which hangs over the unbelieving, he now
   encourages God's faithful and devout servants to entertain good hope,
   by setting forth the sweetness of his grace. Paul likewise observes the
   same order, (2 Corinthians 10:6) for having declared that vengeance was
   in readiness against the disobedient, he immediately adds addressing
   himself to believers "When your obedience is fulfilled." Now, we
   understand the meaning of the Psalmist. As believers might have applied
   to themselves the severity of which he makes mention, he opens to them
   a sanctuary of hope, whither they may flee, in order not to be
   overwhelmed by the terror of God's wrath; [32] just as Joel (Joel 2:32)
   also after having summoned the ungodly to the awful judgment-seat of
   God, which of itself is terrible to men, [33] immediately subjoins the
   comfort, Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
   For it appears to me that this exclamation, Blessed are all they that
   put their trust in him, [34] should be read as a distinct sentence by
   itself. The pronoun him may be referred as well to God as to Christ,
   but, in my judgment, it agrees better with the whole scope of the psalm
   to understand it of Christ, whom the Psalmist before enjoined kings and
   judges of the earth to kiss.

   [29] Ou, car son; or, for his. -- Fr. Marg.

   [30] The word vr, Bar, which here signifies son, is also sometimes used
   to denote pure, as it is in Job 11:4, Psalm 24:4 and 73:1. In this
   former sense it is a Chaldee word, in the latter it is a Hebrew one.
   This rendering, of which Calvin disapproves, is substantially that of
   the Septuagint, which reads, draxasthe paideias, literally, lay hold
   upon instruction. But as the Arabic version of the Psalms, which
   generally follows the Septuagint, has used here (and in many other
   places, where the Septuangint has paideias) a word which signifies not
   only instruction, but good morals, virtue, Street thinks that the
   authors of the Septuangint, by paideias, meant good morals, or virtue
   in general, and that they understand vr, Bar, as a general expression
   for the same thing. The Chaldee, Vulgate, and Ethiopic version, also
   render vr, Bar, by a word meaning doctrine or discipline. "This is a
   remarkable case," says Dr. Adam Clark, "and especially that in so pure
   a piece of Hebrew as this poem is, a Chaldee word should have been
   found, vr, Bar, instead of vn, Ben, which adds nothing to the strength
   of the expression, or the elegance of the poetry. I know that vr, Bar,
   is also pure Hebrew as well as Chaldee; but it is taken in the former
   language in the sense of purifying, the versions probably understood it
   so here. Embrace that which is pure, namely, the doctrine of God.

   PSALM 3.

   David, although driven from his kingdom, and pressed down with utter
   despair of relief from every earthly quarter, ceases not to call upon
   God, and supports himself from his promise against the greatest
   terrors, against the mockery and cruel assaults of his enemies; and,
   finally, against death itself, which then forced itself upon his
   consideration. In the end of the psalm, he congratulates himself and
   the whole Church on the happy issue of all.

   A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his Son [35]

   How bitter David's sorrow was under the conspiracy of his own household
   against him, which arose from the treachery of his own son, it is easy
   for every one of us to conjecture from the feelings of nature. And
   when, in addition to this, he knew that this disaster was brought upon
   him by God for his own fault in having defiled another man's wife, and
   for shedding innocent blood, he might have sunk into despair, and been
   overwhelmed with anguish, if he had not been encouraged by the promise
   of God, and thus hoped for life even in death. From his making no
   allusion here to his sins, we are led to infer, that only one part of
   his prayers is comprised in this psalm; for as God punished him
   expressly on account of his adultery, and his wicked treachery towards
   Uriah, there can be no doubt that he was at first distressed with
   grievous and dreadful torments of mind. But after he had humbled
   himself before God, he took courage; and being well assured of having
   obtained forgiveness, he was fully persuaded that God was on his side,
   and knew that he would always preside over his kingdom, and show
   himself its protector. [36] But he, nevertheless, complained of his
   son, and of the whole faction involved in the conspiracy, because he
   knew that they wickedly rose up for the purpose of frustrating the
   decree of God. In like manner, if at any time God makes use of wicked
   and mischievous men, as scourges to chastise us, it becomes us first
   diligently to consider the cause, namely, that we suffer nothing which
   we have not deserved, in order that this reflection may lead us to
   repentance. But if our enemies, In persecuting us, rather [37] fight
   against God than against us, let the consideration of their doing so be
   immediately followed by the confident persuasion of our safety under
   the protection of him, whose grace, which he hath promised to us, they
   despise and trample under foot.

   Psalm 3:1-2

   1. O Lord, how are my oppressors multiplied! many rise up against me.
   2. Many say to my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.


   Sacred history teaches that David was not only dethroned, but forsaken
   by almost all men; so that he had well nigh as many enemies as he had
   subjects. It is true there accompanied him in his flight a few faithful
   friends; but he escaped in safety, not so much by their aid and
   protection as by the hiding-places of the wilderness. It is therefore
   not wonderful though he was affrighted by the great numbers who were
   opposed to him, for nothing could have taken place more unlooked for,
   on his part, than so sudden a rebellion. It was a mark of uncommon
   faith, when smitten with so great consternation, to venture freely to
   make his complaint to God, and, as it were, to pour out his soul into
   his bosom. [38] And certainly the only remedy for allaying our fears is
   this, to cast upon him all the cares which trouble us; as, on the other
   hand, those who have the conviction that they are not the objects of
   his regard, must be prostrated and overwhelmed by the calamities which
   befall them.

   In the third verse he expresses more distinctly, and more emphatically,
   the pride of his enemies in deriding him as a castaway, and as a person
   whose circumstances were past hope. And he means, that their boldness
   increased hereupon, because they were confident he had been rejected by
   God. Perhaps, in these words also, their ungodliness is indirectly
   referred to, inasmuch as they made no account of the help of God in
   preserving the king whom he had chosen. And this second view is the
   more probable, for Absalom did not flatter himself with the hope of the
   favor of God, but, entirely disregarding him, hoped for victory from
   his own power. David, therefore, expressly introduces both him and the
   rest as speaking after this manner, to show that it was by a monstrous
   and outrageous contempt of God that they were driven to such fury
   against him, as if they made no account whatever of the fact of his
   having been often wonderfully delivered from the greatest dangers. The
   ungodly, when they rise up to destroy us, may not openly break forth
   into such daring presumption as to maintain it to be impossible for us
   to derive any advantage from the favor of God; yet, as they either
   ascribe every thing to fortune, or hold the opinion that a man's
   success will be in proportion to his strength, and therefore fearlessly
   rush forward to gain their object, by all means, whether right or
   wrong, as if it would be equally the same, whether God is angry with or
   favorable towards them, it is evident that they set no value whatever
   upon the favor of God, and mock at the faithful as if it would avail
   them nothing to be under the care and protection of God.

   The translation of some, Many say OF my soul, does not give the true
   meaning of this passage. The letter l lamed is indeed sometimes used as
   meaning of in Hebrew, but David here intended to express something
   more, namely, that his heart was in a manner pierced with the mockery
   of his enemies. The word soul, therefore, in my opinion, here signifies
   the seat of the affections. And it has a corresponding meaning in a
   passage which we shall meet with in another Psalm, (Psalm 35:3,) "Say
   to my soul, I am thy salvation." David thus teaches us by his own
   example, that although the whole world, with one voice, should attempt
   to drive us to despair, instead of listening to it, we ought rather to
   give ear to God alone, and always cherish within us the hope of the
   salvation which he hath promised; and as the ungodly use their
   endeavors to destroy our souls, we ought to defend them by our prayers.
   With respect to the word Selah, interpreters are not agreed. Some
   maintain it is a mark of affirmations and has the same signification as
   truly or amen. Others understand it as meaning for ever. But as sll
   Selal, from which it is derived, signifies to lift up, we incline to
   the opinion of those who think it denotes the lifting up of the voice
   in harmony in the exercise of singing. At the same time, it must be
   observed, that the music was adapted to the sentiment, and so the
   harmony was in unison with the character or subject-matter of the song;
   just as David here, after having complained of his enemies for
   shamefully laughing to scorn his hope, as if the protection of God
   would be of no avail to him, fixes the attention on this blasphemy,
   which severely wounded his heart, by the use of the word Selah; and as
   a little after, when he has added a new ground of confidence with
   regard to the safety of his person, he repeats the same word.

   Psalm 3:3-4

   3. And thou, Jehovah, art a shield for me, my glory, and he that
   exalteth my head. 4. I have cried to the lord with my voice, and he
   heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.


   The copulative and should be resolved into the disjunctive particle
   but, because David employs language full of confidence, in opposition
   to the hardihood and profane scoffings of his enemies, [39] and
   testifies that whatever they may say, he would nevertheless rely upon
   the word of God. It besides appears that he had previously entertained
   an assured hope of deliverance, from the circumstance of his here
   making no mention of his present calamity as a chastisement inflicted
   upon him by the hand of God; but rather depending upon the divine aid,
   he courageously encounters his enemies, who were carrying on an ungodly
   and wicked war against him, seeing they intended to depose a true and
   lawful king from his throne. In short, having acknowledged his sin
   before, he now takes into consideration only the merits of the present
   cause. And thus it becomes the servants of God to act when molested by
   the wicked. Having mourned over their own sins, and humbly betaken
   themselves to the mercy of God, they ought to keep their eyes fixed on
   the obvious and immediate cause of their afflictions, that they may
   entertain no doubt of the help of God when undeservedly subjected to
   evil treatment. Especially when, by their being evil entreated, the
   truth of God is opposed, they ought to be greatly encouraged, and glory
   in the assurance that God without doubt will maintain the truth of his
   own promises against such perfidious and abandoned characters. Had it
   been otherwise with David, he might seem to have claimed these things
   to himself groundlessly, seeing he had deprived himself of the
   approbation and help of God by offending him. [40] But being persuaded
   that he was not utterly cut off from the favor of God, and that God's
   choice of him to be king remained unchanged, he encourages himself to
   hope for a favorable issue to his present trials. And, in the first
   place, by comparing God to a shield, he means that he was defended by
   his power. Hence also he concludes, that God was his glory, because he
   would be the maintainer and defender of the royal dignity which he had
   been pleased to confer upon him. And, on this account, he became so
   bold that he declares he would walk with unabashed brow. [41]

   4. With my voice have I cried unto the Lord. He here informs us that he
   had never been so broken by adversity, or cast down by impious
   scornings, [42] as to be prevented from addressing his prayers to God
   And it was an infallible proof of his faith to exercise it by praying
   even in the midst of his distresses. Nothing is more unbecoming than
   sullenly to gnaw the bit with which we are bridled, and to withhold our
   groaning from God, [43] if, indeed we have any faith in his promise.
   Nor is there a redundancy of expression in these words, I have cried
   with my voice David distinctly mentions his voice, the better to
   express that how much soever the ungodly might rage against him, he was
   by no means struck dumb, but pronounced, in a loud and distinct voice,
   the name of his God; and to do this was a difficult matter under so
   grievous and severe a temptation. He also particularly mentions his
   voice, in order to show that he opposes the voice of prayer to the
   tumultuous outcries of those who either blame fortune or curse God, or
   give way to excessive complainings; those in short, who with passionate
   confusion pour forth their immoderate sorrow. But David's meaning
   appears to me to be principally this, that amidst the blasphemies of
   his enemies by which they endeavored to overwhelm his faith, he was not
   put to silence, but rather lifted up his voice to God, whom the ungodly
   imagined to have become his enemy. He adds that he cried not in vain,
   to encourage all the godly to the like constancy. As to the expression,
   from the hill of his holiness or, which signifies the same things from
   his holy hill, it is improperly explained of heaven, as has been done
   by some. Heaven, I indeed confess, is often called, in other places,
   God's holy palace; but here David has doubtless a reference to the ark
   of the covenant, which at that time stood on Mount Sion. And he
   expressly affirms that he was heard from thence, though he had been
   compelled to flee into the wilderness. The Sacred History relates, (2
   Samuel 15:24,) that when Abiathar the priest commanded the ark to be
   carried by the Levites, David would not suffer it. And in this the
   wonderful faith of the holy man appears conspicuous. He knew that the
   Lord had chosen Sion to be the dwelling place of the ark, but he was,
   notwithstanding, willing rather to be torn from that sacred symbol of
   the divine presence, (which was painful to him as if his own bowels had
   been torn from him,) than make any innovation not sanctioned by the
   will of heaven. Now, he boasts, that although he was deprived of the
   sight of the ark, and notwithstanding the distance to which he was
   removed from it, God was near him to listen to his prayers. By these
   words he intimates that he kept a due medium, inasmuch as he neither
   despised the visible sign, which the Lord had appointed on account of
   the rudeness of the times, nor by attaching a superstitious importance
   to a particular place, entertained carnal conceptions of the glory of
   God. Thus, he did not idly scatter words which would vanish into air,
   as unbelievers are wont to do, who pray also but are in doubt to what
   place they ought to direct their speech. David turned himself directly
   towards the tabernacle, whence God had promised to be merciful to his
   servants. Hence the confidence with which he prayed; and this
   confidence was not without success. In our day, since there is
   fulfilled in Christ what was formerly shadowed forth by the figures of
   the law, a much easier way of approach to God is opened up for us,
   provided we do not knowingly and willingly wander from the way.

   Psalm 3:5-6

   5. I laid me down and slept, I awaked; for the lord sustained me. 6. I
   will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who have set their camps
   against me on all sides.


   According to the usage of the Hebrews, these words, which are in the
   past tense, I laid me down and slept, are taken sometimes for the
   future, I will lie down and sleep. [44] If we retain the reading of the
   verb in the past tense, David expresses a wonderful and almost
   incredible steadfastness of mind in that he slept so soundly in the
   midst of many deaths, as if he had been beyond the reach of all danger.
   He had doubtless been tossed amidst the merciless waves of anxiety, but
   it is certain their violence had been allayed by means of faith, so
   that however much he was disquieted, he reposed in God. Thus the godly
   never fail in ultimately proving victorious over all their fears,
   whereas the ungodly, who do not rely upon God, are overwhelmed with
   despair, even when they meet with the smallest perils. Some think there
   is here a change of tenses; and, therefore, translate the verbs into
   the fixture tense, I will lay me down and will sleep, and will awake,
   because immediately after a verb of the future is subjoined, The Lord
   shall uphold me But as he expresses, by these last words, a continuous
   act, I thought it unnecessary to change the tenses in the three first
   verbs. Still we ought to know, that this confidence of safety is not to
   be referred peculiarly to the time of his affliction, or, at least, is
   not to be limited to it: for, in my judgment, David rather declares how
   much good he had obtained by means of faith and prayer; namely the
   peaceful and undisturbed state of a well regulated mind. This he
   expresses metaphorically when he says, that he did the ordinary actions
   of life without being disturbed by fear. "I have not lain," says he,
   "waking and restless on my bed; but I have slept soundly, whereas such
   manner of sleeping does not generally happen to those who are full of
   thought and fear." But let us particularly notice that David came to
   have this confidence of safety from the protection of God, and not from
   stupidity of mind. Even the wicked are kept fast asleep through an
   intoxication of mind, while they dream of having made a covenant with
   death. It was otherwise with David, who found rest on no other ground
   but because he was upheld by the power of God, and defended by his
   help. In the next verse, he enlarges upon the incalculable efficacy of
   this confidence, of which all the godly have some understanding, from
   their experience of the divine protection. As the power of God is
   infinite, so they conclude that it shall be invincible against all the
   assaults, outrages, preparations, and forces of the whole world. And,
   indeed, unless we ascribe this honor to God, our courage shall be
   always failing us. Let us, therefore, learn, when in dangers, not to
   measure the assistance of God after the manner of man, but to despise
   whatever terrors may stand in our way, inasmuch as all the attempts
   which men may make against God, are of little or no account.

   Psalm 3:7-8

   7. Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God; for thou hast smitten all mine
   enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
   8. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; thy blessing is upon thy people.
   Selah.


   7 Arise, O Lord. As in the former verses David boasted of his quiet
   state, it would now appear he desires of the Lord to be preserved in
   safety during the whole of his life; as if he had said, Lord, since
   thou hast overthrown my enemies, grant that this thy goodness may
   follow me, and be continued even to the end of my course. But because
   it is no uncommon thing for David, in the Psalms, to mingle together
   various affections, it seems more probable, that, after having made
   mention of his confidence in God, he returns again to make the same
   prayers as at the beginning. [45] He therefore asks to be preserved,
   because he was in eminent peril. What follows concerning the smiting of
   his enemies, may be explained in two ways: either that in praying he
   calls to his remembrance his former victories, or that having
   experienced the assistance of God, and obtained the answer of his
   prayers, he now follows it up by thanksgiving: and this last meanings I
   am much inclined to adopt. In the first place, then, he declares that
   he fled to God for help in dangers, and humbly prayed for deliverance,
   and after salvation had been granted him, he gives thanks, by which he
   testifies, that he acknowledged God to be the author of the deliverance
   which he had obtained. [46]

   8. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord. Because l is sometimes used by
   the Hebrews for mk Min, some not improperly translate this clause,
   Salvation is of the Lord. I, however consider the natural and obvious
   meaning to be simply this, that salvation or deliverance is only in the
   hands of God. By these words, David not only claims the office and
   praise of saving for God alone, tacitly opposing his power to all human
   succor; but also declares, that although a thousand deaths hang over
   his people, yet this cannot render God unable to save them, or prevent
   him from speedily sending forth without any effort, the deliverance
   which he is always able to impart. In the end of the psalm, David
   affirms that this was vouchsafed, not so much to him as an individual,
   as to the whole people, that the universal Church, whose welfare
   depended on the safety and prosperity of his kingdom, might be
   preserved from destruction. David, therefore, acknowledges the
   dispersion of this wicked conspiracy to have been owing to the care
   which God had about the safety of his Church. From this passage we
   learn, that the Church shall always be delivered from the calamities
   which befall her, because God who is able to save her, will never
   withdraw his grace and blessing from her.

   PSALM 4.

   After David in the beginning of the psalm has prayed to God to help
   him, he immediately turns his discourse to his enemies, and depending
   on the promise of God, triumphs over them as a conqueror. He,
   therefore, teaches us by his example, that as often as we are weighed
   down by adversity, or involved in very great distress, we ought to
   meditate upon the promises of God, in which the hope of salvation is
   held forth to us, so that defending ourselves by this shield, we may
   break through all the temptations which assail us.

   To the chief musician on Neginoth. A psalm of David.

   It is uncertain at what time this psalm was composed. But from the
   tenor of it, it is conjectured, with probability, that David was then a
   fugitive and an exile. I therefore refer it to the time when he was
   persecuted by Saul. If, however, any person is disposed rather to
   understand it as referring to the time when he was compelled by the
   conspiracy of Absalom to secure his safety by flight, I will not
   greatly contend about the matter. But as, a little after, he uses an
   expression, namely, "How long?" (verse 3) [47] which indicates that he
   had a lengthened struggle, the opinion which I have already brought
   forward is the more probable. For we know with what varied trials he
   was harassed, before he obtained complete deliverance, from the time
   when Saul began to be his enemy. Concerning the words which are
   contained in this verse, I shall only make one or two brief
   observations. Some translate the word mnth, Lamnetsah, for ever; and
   they say that it was the commencement of a common song, to the tune of
   which this psalm was composed: [48] but this I reject as a forced
   translation. Others, with more truth, are of opinion, that mntsh,
   Menetsah, signifies one who excels and surpasses all others. But
   because expositors are not agreed as to the particular kind of
   excellence and dignity here spoken of, let it suffice, that by this
   word is denoted the chief master or president of the band. [49] I do
   not approve of rendering the word, conqueror; for although it answers
   to the subject-matter of the present psalm, yet it does not at all suit
   other places where we shall find the same Hebrew word used. With
   respect to the second word, Neginoth, I think it comes from the verb
   ngk, Nagan, which signifies to strike or sound; and, therefore, I doubt
   not, but it was an instrument of music. Whence it follows, that this
   psalm was designed to be sung, not only with the voice, but also with
   musical instruments, which were presided over, and regulated by the
   chief musician of whom we have just now spoken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 4:1

   1. Answer me when I cry, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged
   me in distress; have pity upon me, and hear my prayer.


   In these words there is shown the faith of David, who, although brought
   to the uttermost distress, and indeed almost consumed by a long series
   of calamities, did not sink under his sorrow; nor was he so broken in
   heart as to be prevented from betaking himself to God his deliverer. By
   his praying, he testified, that when utterly deprived of all earthly
   succor, there yet remained for him hope in God. Moreover, he calls him
   the God of his righteousness, which is the same thing as if he had
   called him the vindicator of his right; [50] and he appeals to God,
   because all men everywhere condemned him, and his innocence was borne
   down by the slanderous reports of his enemies and the perverse
   judgments of the common people. And this cruel and unjust treatment
   which David met with, ought to be carefully marked. For while nothing
   is more painful to us than to be falsely condemned, and to endure, at
   one and the same time, wrongful violence and slander; yet to be ill
   spoken of for doing well, is an affliction which daily befalls the
   saints. And it becomes them to be so exercised under it as to turn away
   from all the enticements of the world, and to depend wholly upon God
   alone. Righteousness, therefore, is here to be understood of a good
   cause, of which David makes God the witness, while he complains of the
   malicious and wrongful conduct of men towards him; and, by his example,
   he teaches us, that if at any time our uprightness is not seen and
   acknowledged by the world, we ought not on that account to despond,
   inasmuch as we have one in heaven to vindicate our cause. Even the
   heathen have said there is no better stage for virtue than a man's own
   conscience. But it is a consolation far surpassing this, to know when
   men vaunt themselves over us wrongfully, that we are standing in the
   view of God and of the angels. Paul, we know, was endued with courage
   arising from this source, (1 Corinthians 4:5) for when many evil
   reports were spread abroad concerning him among the Corinthians, he
   appeals to the judgment-seat of God. Isaiah also, fortified by the same
   confidence, (Isaiah 50:6 and following verse) despises all the slanders
   by which his enemies calumniated him. If, therefore, we cannot find
   justice anywhere in the world the only support of our patience is to
   look to God, and to rest contented with the equity of his judgment. It
   may, however, be asked by way of objection, Since all the purity of men
   is mere pollution in the sight of God, how can the godly dare to bring
   forward their own righteousness before him? With respect to David, it
   is easy to answer this question. He did not boast of his own
   righteousness except in reference to his enemies, from whose calumnies
   he vindicated himself. He had the testimony of a good conscience that
   he had attempted nothing without the call and commandment of God, and
   therefore he does not speak rashly when he calls God the protector and
   defender of his right. Hence we learn that David honored God with this
   title of praise, in order the more readily to set him in contrast with
   the whole world. And as he asks twice to be heard, in this there is
   expressed to us both the vehemence of his grief and the earnestness of
   his prayers. In the last clause of the verse, he also shows whence he
   expected to obtain what he needed, namely, from the mercy of God. And
   certainly, as often as we ask anything from God, it becomes us to begin
   with this, and to beseech him, according to his free goodness, to
   relieve our miseries.

   Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress. Some think that David
   here promises himself what he had not yet experienced; and in the
   exercise of hope anticipates the manifestations of God's grace with
   which he should afterwards be favored. But, in my opinion, he rather
   mentions the benefits which he formerly received from God, and by these
   strengthens himself against the time to come. Thus the faithful are
   accustomed to call to their remembrance those things which tend to
   strengthen their faith. We shall, hereafter meet with many passages
   similar to this, where David, in order to give energy to his faith
   against terrors and dangers, [51] brings together the many experiences
   from which he had learned that God is always present with his own
   people and will never disappoint their desires. The mode of expression
   which he here employs is metaphorical, and by it he intimates that a
   way of escape was opened up to him even when he was besieged and
   enclosed on every side. The distress of which he speaks, in my opinion,
   refers not less to the state of his mind than to circumstances of
   outward affliction; for David's heart was not of such an iron mould as
   to prevent him from being cast into deeper mental anguish by adversity.

   Psalm 4:2-3

   2. O ye sons of men, how long will ye try to turn my glory into shame?
   how long will ye love vanity, and seeking after lying? Selah 3. But
   know that Jehovah hath chosen for himself one who is merciful: Jehovah
   will hear when I call upon him.


   2. O ye sons of men. The happy result of the prayer of David was, that
   resuming courage, he was able not only to repel the fury of his
   enemies, but also to challenge them on his part, and fearlessly to
   despise all their machinations. That our confidence, therefore, may
   remain unshaken, we ought not, when assailed by the wicked, to enter
   into conflict without being furnished like David with the same armor.
   The sum is, that since God was determined to defend David by his own
   power, it was in vain for all the men in the world to endeavor to
   destroy him; however great the power which they otherwise might have of
   doing him injury. By calling those whom he addresses the sons, not of
   Adam, or of some common persons but of men, he seems by the way to
   reprove their pride. [52] I do not agree with certain Jewish expositors
   who think that nobles or men of rank are meant. It is rather an
   ironical concession of what they claimed to themselves, by which he
   ridicules their presumption, in esteeming themselves to be noble and
   wise, whereas it was only blind rage which impelled them to wicked
   enterprises. In the words how long, he condemns their perverse
   obstinacy; for what he means, is not that they were stirred up against
   him merely by some sudden impulses, but that the stubborn purpose of
   injuring him was deeply fixed in their hearts. Had not their
   maliciousness deprived them of their understanding, the many instances
   in which God had proved himself to be David's defender would have
   compelled them to desist from their attempts against him. But as they
   were fully determined to disgrace him whom God had exalted to the royal
   throne he asks them, How long they will persevere in their endeavors to
   turn his glory into shame And it is to be observed that although loaded
   with every kind of reproach, both among the high and the low he yet
   courageously keeps fast hold of the glory or the honor of royalty which
   God had graciously promised him, or had conferred upon him, and is
   fully persuaded that God will at length vindicate his right to it,
   however much his enemies might wickedly endeavor to blot and obscure it
   by treating his pretensions with derision and scorn.

   How long will ye love vanity? In these words, he partly reproaches his
   enemies for the wicked and perverse passions with which he saw them to
   be impelled, although they falsely pretended to be actuated by a godly
   zeal; and he partly derides their folly in flattering themselves with
   the hope of success while fighting against God. And it is a most
   pointed rebuke. Even when the ungodly rush headlong into all manner of
   wickedness with the grossest [53] malice, they soothe themselves with
   deceitful flatteries in order not to be disturbed with the feelings of
   remorse. David, therefore, cries out, that wilfully to shut their eyes
   and varnish their unrighteousness with deceitful colors, would avail
   them nothing. The ungodly may indeed flatter and delude themselves, but
   when they are brought in good earnest to the trial, it will be always
   manifest that the reason why they are deceived is, because from the
   beginning they were determined to deal deceitfully. Now, from this
   place, we ought to take a shield of invincible steadfastness as often
   as we see ourselves overmatched in prudence and subtlety by the wicked.
   For with whatever engines they assault us, yet if we have the testimony
   of a good conscience, God will remain on our side, and against him they
   shall not prevail. They may greatly excel in ingenuity, and possess
   much power of hurting us, and have their plans and subsidiary aid in
   the greatest readiness, and be very shrewd in discernment, yet whatever
   they may invent, it will be but lying and vanity.

   3. Know that Jehovah hath set apart, etc This is a confirmation of the
   preceding verse, for it shows that the cause of David's boldness
   consisted in this, that he depended upon God, the founder of his
   kingdom. And surely we may then safely triumph over our enemies when we
   are assured of having the call of God to the office which we hold, or
   the work in which we are engaged. Accordingly, David does not here
   boast of his own strength, or riches, or armies by which he obtained
   the kingdom. But as he was chosen by God, he intimates that the many
   attempts of his enemies against him would be without success, because
   they would find from experience, that God, whose power they could not
   successfully resist, was against them. In the first place, he says that
   he was set apart by God, by which he means that he was advanced to the
   throne, not by the will of man, or by his own ambition, but by the
   appointment of God. The Hebrew word phlh, Phalah, signifies to
   separate, and it here refers to separation to honor and dignity; as if
   he had said you admit no one as king but he who is chosen by your own
   suffrages, or who pleases you; but it is the peculiar prerogative of
   God to make choice of whom he will. By the word merciful or bountiful,
   he doubtless vindicates his right to be king, from the fact that this
   was a quality which belonged to himself; it is as if he had produced
   the mark or badge of his calling. For it was truly said in the old
   proverb, Mercy is the virtue most suitable for kings. Now, God usually
   furnishes those whom he reckons worthy of having this honor conferred
   upon them, with the endowments requisite for the exercise of their
   office, that they may not be as dead idols. Some understand the word
   chsyd, chasid, in a passive sense, not as denoting a beneficent person,
   but one who is placed on the throne by the favor of God. As, however, I
   meet with no examples of this signification of the word in Scripture, I
   think it safer to follow the common interpretation, which is this: God
   has chosen a king, who answers to the character which should be
   possessed by all who are called to fill such an exalted station, in as
   much as he is merciful and beneficent. Hence, he infers that he would
   be heard by God as often as he called upon him; for God principally
   proves his faithfulness in this, that he does not forsake the work of
   his own hands, but continually defends those whom he has once received
   into his favor. Hence, we are taught fearlessly to proceed in our path;
   because whatever we may have undertaken according to his will, shall
   never be ineffectual. Let this truth then, obtain a fixed place in our
   minds, that God will never withhold his assistance from those who go on
   sincerely in their course. Without this comfort, the faithful must
   inevitably sink into despondency every moment.

   Psalm 4:4-5

   4. Tremble then, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
   bed, and be still. Selah. 5. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness,
   and put your trust in the Lord.


   4. Tremble then. Now he exhorts his enemies to repentance, if
   peradventure, their madness was not wholly incorrigible. In the first
   place, he bids them tremble, or be troubled; a word by which he rebukes
   their stupidity in running headlong in their wicked course, without any
   fear of God, or any sense of danger. And certainly the great
   presumption of all the ungodly in not hesitating to engage in war
   against God, proceeds from their being hardened through an infatuated
   security; and by their thoughtlessness, they render themselves stupid,
   and become more obdurate by forgetting both God and themselves, and
   following whithersoever lust leads them. He tells them that the best
   remedy to cure their rage, and prevent them from sinning any longer,
   would be to awaken from their lethargy and begin to be afraid and
   tremble; as if he had said, As soon as you shall have shaken off your
   drowsiness and insensibility, your desire of sinning will abate; for
   the reason why the ungodly are troublesome to the good and the simple,
   and cause so much confusion, is because they are too much at peace with
   themselves.

   He afterwards admonishes them to commune with their own heart upon
   their bed, that is, to take an account of themselves at leisure, and as
   it were, in some place of deep retirement; [54] an exercise which is
   opposed to their indulgence of their unruly passions. In the end of the
   verse he enjoins them to be still. Now, it is to be observed, that the
   cause of this stillness is the agitation and trembling, of which he
   before made mention. For if any have been hurried into sin by their
   infatuated recklessness, the first step of their return to a sound mind
   is to awaken themselves from their deep sleep to fearfulness and
   trembling. After this follows calm and deliberate reflection; then they
   consider and reconsider to what dangers they have been exposing
   themselves; and thus at length they, whose audacious spirits shrink at
   nothing, learn to be orderly and peaceable, or, at least, they restrain
   their frantic violence.

   To commune upon one's bed, is a form of expression taken from the
   common practice and experience of men. We know that, during our
   intercourse with men in the day time, our thoughts are distracted, and
   we often judge rashly, being deceived by the external appearance;
   whereas in solitude, we can give to any subject a closer attention;
   and, farther, the sense of shame does not then hinder a man from
   thinking without disguise of his own faults. David, therefore, exhorts
   his enemies to withdraw from those who witnessed and judged of their
   actions on the public stage of life, and to be alone, that they may
   examine themselves more truthfully and honestly. And this exhortation
   has a respect to us all; for there is nothing to which men are more
   prone than to deceive one another with empty applause, until each man
   enter into himself, and commune alone with his own heart. Paul, when
   quoting this passage in Ephesians 4:26, or, at least when alluding to
   the sentiment of David, follows the Septuagint, "Be ye angry and sin
   not." And yet he has skilfully and beautifully applied it to his
   purpose. He there teaches us that men, instead of wickedly pouring
   forth their anger against their neighbors, have rather just cause to be
   angry with themselves, in order that, by this means, they may abstain
   from sin. And, therefore, he commands them rather to fret inwardly, and
   be angry with themselves; and then to be angry, not so much at the
   persons, as at the vices of others.

   5. Sacrifice ye. Many are of opinion that David exhorts his enemies to
   give some evidence of their repentance; and I certainly admit, that
   sacrifices were partly enjoined for the purpose of inducing men to walk
   in newness of life. But when I consider the character of the men who
   opposed David, I am satisfied that he here censures their hypocrisy,
   and beats down their groundless boasting. David, when he wandered as a
   fugitive in deserts, or in caves, or on mountains, or in the regions
   beyond his own country, might seem to have been separated from the
   Church of God; and certainly he was commonly accounted as a corrupt
   member cut off from the body and the communion of the saints. Meanwhile
   the ark of the covenant was in the hands of his enemies, they kept
   possession of the temple, and they were the first in offering
   sacrifices. They, therefore, vaunted themselves against David with the
   same boldness and presumption with which we know hypocrites to have
   been always puffed up. Nor is it to be doubted, but they proudly abused
   the name of God as if they only had been his true worshippers. [55] But
   as Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:4) rebukes the ungodly, because of the false
   confidence which they placed in the temple of the Lord; so David also
   denies that God is pacified by mere outward ceremonies, since he
   requires pure sacrifices. There is in the words an implied contrast
   between the sacrifices of righteousness, and all those vain and
   spurious rites [56] with which the counterfeit worshippers of God
   satisfy themselves. The sum, therefore, is, "You boast of having God on
   your side, because you have free access to his altar to offer your
   sacrifices there with great pomp; and because I am banished from the
   Holy Land, and not suffered to come to the temple, you think that I am
   not an object of the divine care. But you must worship God in a far
   different manner, if you would expect any good at his hand; for your
   unclean sacrifices with which you pollute his altar, so far from
   rendering him favorable to you, will do nothing else but provoke his
   wrath." Let us learn from this passage, that, in contending with the
   corrupters of true religion, who may have the name of God continually
   in their mouth, and vaunt themselves on account of their observance of
   his outward worship, we may safely rebuke their boasting, because they
   do not offer the right sacrifices. But, at the same time, we must
   beware lest a vain pretense of godliness foster in us a perverse and
   ill founded confidence, in place of true hope.

   Psalm 4:6-7

   6. Many say, Who will show us good? [57] Lift thou up upon us the light
   of thy countenance, O Jehovah. 7. Thou hast given more joy to my heart
   than they have in the time when their corn and their wine are
   increased.


   6. Many say. Some are of opinion that David here complains of the cruel
   malice of his enemies, because they greedily sought for his life. But
   David, I have no doubt, compares the sole wish with which his own heart
   was burning, to the many desires with which almost all mankind are
   distracted. As it is not a principle held and acted upon by ungodly
   men, that those only can be truly and perfectly happy who are
   interested in the favor of God, and that they ought to live as
   strangers and pilgrims in the world, in order through hope and patience
   to obtain, in due time, a better life, they remain contented with
   perishing good things; and, therefore, if they enjoy outward
   prosperity, they are not influenced by any great concern about God.
   Accordingly, while, after the manner of the lower animals, they grasp
   at various objects, some at one thing, and some at another, thinking to
   find in them supreme happiness, David, with very good reason, separates
   himself from them, and proposes to himself an end of an entirely
   opposite description. I do not quarrel with the interpretation which
   supposes that David is here complaining of his own followers, who,
   finding their strength insufficient for bearing the hardships which
   befell them, and exhausted by weariness and grief, indulged in
   complaints, and anxiously desired repose. But I am rather inclined to
   extend the words farther, and to view them as meaning that David,
   contented with the favor of God alone, protests that he disregards, and
   sets no value on objects which others ardently desire. This comparison
   of the desire of David with the desires of the world, well illustrates
   this important doctrine, [58] that the faithful, forming a low estimate
   of present good things, rest in God alone, and account nothing of more
   value than to know from experience that they are interested in his
   favor. David, therefore, intimates in the first place, that all those
   are fools, who, wishing to enjoy prosperity, do not begin with seeking
   the favor of God; for, by neglecting to do this, they are carried about
   by the various false opinions which are abroad. In the second place, he
   rebukes another vice, namely, that of gross and earthly men in giving
   themselves wholly to the ease and comforts of the flesh, and in
   settling down in, or contenting themselves with, the enjoyment of these
   alone, without thinking of any thing higher. [59] Whence also it comes
   to pass, that as long as they are supplied with other things according
   to their desire, they are altogether indifferent about God, just as if
   they had no need of him. David, on the contrary, testifies, that
   although he may be destitute of all other good things, the fatherly
   love of God is sufficient to compensate for the loss of them all. This,
   therefore, is the purport of the whole: "The greater number of men
   greedily seek after present pleasures and advantages; but I maintain
   that perfect felicity is only to be found in the favor of God."

   David uses the expression, The light of God's countenance, to denote
   his serene and pleasant countenance -- the manifestations of his favor
   and love; just as, on the other hand, the face of God seems to us dark
   and clouded when he shows the tokens of his anger. This light, by a
   beautiful metaphor, is said to be lifted up, when, shining in our
   hearts, it produces trust and hope. It would not be enough for us to be
   beloved by God, unless the sense of this love came home to our hearts;
   but, shining upon them by the Holy Spirit, he cheers us with true and
   solid joy. This passage teaches us that those are miserable who do not,
   with full resolution, repose themselves wholly in God, and take
   satisfaction therein, [60] even although they may have an overflowing
   abundance of all earthly things; while, on the other hand, the
   faithful, although they are tossed amidst many troubles, are truly
   happy, were there no other ground for it but this, that God's fatherly
   countenance shines upon them, which turns darkness into light, and, as
   I may say, quickens even death itself.

   7. Thou hast given more joy to my heart. By another comparison he
   better expresses and illustrates the strength of his affection, showing
   that, having obtained the good which he had longed for, he does not in
   the least degree envy the wealth and enjoyments of others, but is
   altogether contented with his own lot. The sum is, that he had more
   satisfaction in seeing the reconciled countenance of God beaming upon
   him, than if he had possessed garners full of corn, and cellars full of
   wine. [61] Interpreters are not agreed as to the word mt, me-eth, which
   we have translated, in the time. Some give this rendering, Thou hast
   put gladness into my heart, Since The Time that their corn and wine
   increased; as if David had said, I rejoice when I see mine enemies
   prospering in the world. [62] But the former translation appears to me
   much more suitable; according to which David declares, that he rejoices
   more in the favor of God alone, than earthly men rejoice when they
   enjoy all earthly good things, with the desire of which they are
   generally inflamed. He had represented them as so bent upon, and
   addicted to, the pursuit of worldly prosperity, as to have no great
   care about God; and now he adds, that their joy in the abundance and
   increase of their wine and corn is not so great as is his joy in a
   sense of the divine goodness alone. This verse contains very profitable
   instruction. We see how earthly men, after they have despised the grace
   of God, and plunged themselves over head and ears in transitory
   pleasures, are so far from being satisfied with them, that the very
   abundance of them inflames their desires the more; and thus, in the
   midst of their fullness, a secret uneasiness renders their minds
   uncomfortable. Never, therefore, shall we obtain undisturbed peace and
   solid joy until the favor of God shine upon us. And although the
   faithful also desire and seek after their worldly comforts, yet they do
   not pursue them with immoderate and irregular ardor; but can patiently
   bear to be deprived of them, provided they know themselves to be the
   objects of the divine care.

   Psalm 4:8

   8. I will lay me down, and will sleep together in peace; for thou,
   Lord, hast placed me alone [63] in safety.


   He concludes, by stating, that as he is protected by the power of God,
   he enjoys as much security and quiet as if he had been defended by all
   the garrisons on earth. Now, we know, that to be free from all fear,
   and from the torment and vexation of care, is a blessing to be desired
   above all other things. This verse, therefore, is a confirmation of the
   former sentence, intimating that David justly prefers the joy produced
   by the light of God's fatherly love before all other objects for inward
   peace of mind certainly surpasses all the blessings of which we can
   form any conception. Many commentators explain this place as expressing
   David's hope, that his enemies will be reconciled to him, so that he
   may sleep with them in peace, God having granted him the peculiar
   privilege of being able to rest without being disturbed or disquieted
   by any man. But in my judgment the proper meaning is this, that he will
   live as quietly and securely alone, as in the midst of a great host of
   men, because God defends him for in the words, I will sleep together, I
   consider the particle as to be understood, as if the reading were as
   together, that is to say, as with a multitude. Some refer lvdd,
   lebadad, alone, to God, translating the words thus, Thou alone, O Lord,
   hast set me in safety; but this I do not at all approve, because, by
   taking away the contrast between these two words, together and alone,
   much of the beauty of the sentence is lost. In short, David boasts that
   the protection of God alone was sufficient, and that under it he sleeps
   as securely, although destitute of all human guardianship, as if he had
   had many to keep watch and ward continually over him, or as if he had
   been defended on all sides by a great company. Let us therefore, learn
   from his example, to yield this honor to God -- to believe, that
   although there may appear no help for us from men, yet under his hand
   alone we are kept in peace and safety, as if we were surrounded by a
   great host.

   PSALM 5.

   David being grievously oppressed by the cruelty of his enemies, and
   apprehending still more mischief, earnestly beseeches God for help. And
   the more easily to obtain what he asks, after having, by the
   earnestness of his prayers, manifested the greatness of his grief, he
   first brings forward the intolerable malice of his enemies, showing how
   inconsistent it would be with the character of God, were they to be
   left unpunished. He next speaks of his own faith and patience, and even
   comfort; having no doubt whatever of a happy issue. Finally, he
   concludes, that when he shall be delivered, the benefits resulting from
   his deliverance would not be limited to himself, but would extend to
   all the godly.

   To the chief musician upon Nehiloth. A psalm of David.

   Some translate the Hebrew word Nehiloth, heritages, and others, armies.
   The former assign this reason for their opinion, that David prayed for
   the welfare of the twelve tribes, whom he calls heritages. [64] The
   latter assert in support of their view, that being besieged by a vast
   multitude of men, he betook himself to God for succor; and, according
   to this sense, the word upon will signify against. But not approving of
   the conjectures of many who speak upon these inscriptions of The Psalms
   as if they were riddles, [65] I adopt the opinion of those who hold
   that it was either a musical instrument or a tune; but of what
   particular kind I consider it of little importance to ascertain.

   Psalm 5:1-2

   1. Give ear unto my words, O Jehovah; attend to my speech. 2. Hearken
   to the voice of my cry, my King and my God: for unto thee will I pray.


   I presume not positively to determine whether David, in this psalm,
   bewails the wrongs which he suffered from his enemies at some
   particular time, or whether he complains generally of the various
   persecutions with which, for a long time, he was harassed under Saul.
   Some of the Jewish commentators apply the psalm even to Absalom;
   because, by the bloody and deceitful man, they think Doeg and
   Ahithophel are pointed out. To me, however, it appears more probable,
   that when David, after the death of Saul, had got peaceable possession
   of the kingdoms he committed to writing the prayers which he had
   meditated in his afflictions and dangers. But to come to the words:--
   First, he expresses one thing in three different ways; and this
   repetition denotes the strength of his affection, and his long
   perseverance in prayer. For he was not so fond of many words as to
   employ different forms of expression, which had no meaning; but being
   deeply engaged in prayer, he represented, by these various expressions,
   the variety of his complaints. [66] It therefore signifies, that he
   prayed neither coldly nor only in few words; but that, according as the
   vehemence of his grief urged him, he was earnest in bewailing his
   calamities before God; and that since it did not immediately appear
   what would be their issue, he persevered in repeating the same
   complaints. Again, he does not expressly state what he desires to ask
   from God: [67] but there is a greater force in this kind of
   suppression, than if he had spoken distinctly. By not uttering the
   desires of his heart, he shows more emphatically that his inward
   feelings, which he brought with him before God, were such that language
   was insufficient to express them. Again, the word cry, which signifies
   a loud and sonorous utterance of the voice, serves to mark the
   earnestness of his desire. David did not cry out as it were into the
   ears of one who was deaf; but the vehemence of his grief and his inward
   anguish, burst forth into this cry. The verb hghhagah, from which the
   noun hgyg, hagig, speech, which the prophet here uses, is derived,
   means both to speak distinctly, and to whisper or to mutter. But the
   second sense seems better suited to this passage. [68] After David has
   said in general, that God hears his words, he seems, immediately after,
   for the purpose of being more specific, to divide them into two kinds,
   calling the one obscure or indistinct moanings, and the other loud
   crying. [69] By the first he means a confused muttering, such as is
   described in the Song of Hezekiah, when sorrow hindered him from
   speaking distinctly, and making his voice to be heard. "Like a crane,
   or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourn as a dove," (Isaiah 38:14.)
   [70] If, then, at any time we are either backward to pray, or our
   devout affections begin to lose their fervor, we must here seek for
   arguments to quicken and urge us forward. And as by calling God his
   King and his God, he intended to stir up himself to entertain more
   lively and favorable hopes with respect to the issue of his
   afflictions, let us learn to apply these titles to a similar use,
   namely, for the purpose of making ourselves more familiar with God. At
   the close, he testifies that he does not sullenly gnaw the bit, as
   unbelievers are accustomed to do; but directs his groaning to God: for
   they who, disregarding God, either fret inwardly or utter their
   complaints to men, are not worthy of being regarded by him. Some
   translate the last clause thus, When I pray to thee; but to me it seems
   rather to be the reason which David assigns for what he had said
   immediately before, and that his purpose is, to encourage himself to
   trust in God, by assuming this as a general principle that whoever call
   upon God in their calamities never meet with a repulse from him.

   Psalm 5:3

   3. O that thou wouldst hear my voice in the morning; O Jehovah, in the
   morning will I direct unto thee, and I will keep watch.


   The first sentence may also be read in the future tense of the
   indicative mood, Thou shalt hear my prayer. But, in my opinion, the
   verb is rather in the optative mood, as I have translated it. Having
   besought God to grant his requests, he now entreats him to make haste.
   Some think he alludes to the morning prayers which were wont to be
   joined with the daily sacrifices in the temple, according to the
   appointment of the law. Although I do not disapprove of this opinion,
   yet I have no doubt but that, constrained by the weariness of a
   somewhat lengthened delay, he wishes his deliverance to be hastened; as
   if he had said, "As soon as I awaken this will be the first subject of
   my thoughts. Therefore, O Lord, delay no longer the help of which I
   stand in need, but grant immediately my desires." The expression, To
   direct unto God, I take to signify the same thing as directly to
   approach to God. Many, as if the language were elliptical, supply the
   words, my prayer. But in my judgment, David rather intends to declare
   that he was not turned hither and thither, nor drawn different ways by
   the temptations to which he was exposed, but that to betake himself to
   God was the settled order of his life. There is, in the words, an
   implied contrast between the rambling and uncertain movements of those
   who look around them for worldly helps, or depend on their own counsels
   and the direct leading of faith, by which all the godly are withdrawn
   from the vain allurements of the world, and have recourse to God alone.
   The Hebrew word rk, arac, signifies to set in order or dispose, and
   sometimes to dress or make fit. This sense is very suitable to the
   passage, in which David plainly declares it to be his determination not
   to be drawn away in any degree from his orderly course into the
   indirect and circuitous paths of error and sin, but to come directly to
   God. By the word, watch, he conveys the idea of hope and patience as
   well as of anxiety. As tsphh, tsapah, in Hebrew means, to wait for, as
   well as to look for, David, I have no doubt, intended to say, that
   after he had disburdened his cares into the bosom of God, he would,
   with an anxious mind, look out, as it were, like a sentinel, until it
   should appear, that in very deed God had heard him. No doubt, in the
   exercise of longing, there is always implied some degree of uneasiness;
   but he who is looking out for the grace of God with anxious desire,
   will patiently wait for it. This passages therefore, teaches us the
   uselessness of those prayers to which there is not added that hope
   which may be said to elevate the minds of the petitioners into a
   watch-tower.

   Psalm 5:4-6

   4. For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; [71] evil
   shall not dwell Smith thee. 5. The foolish shall not stand in thy
   sight; thou hatest all that commit iniquity. 6. Thou shalt destroy them
   that speak falsehood; Jehovah will abhor the blood-thirsty [72] and
   deceitful man.


   Here David makes the malice and wickedness of his enemies an argument
   to enforce his prayer for the divine favor towards him. The language is
   indeed abrupt, as the saints in prayer will often stammer; but this
   stammering is more acceptable to God than all the figures of rhetoric,
   be they ever so fine and glittering. Besides, the great object which
   David has in view, is to show, that since the cruelty and treachery of
   his enemies had reached their utmost height, it was impossible but that
   God would soon arrest them in their course. His reasoning is grounded
   upon the nature of God. Since righteousness and upright dealing are
   pleasing to him, David, from this, concludes that he will take
   vengeance on all the unjust and wicked. And how is it possible for them
   to escape from his hand unpunished, seeing he is the judge of the
   world? The passage is worthy of our most special attention. For we know
   how greatly we are discouraged by the unbounded insolence of the
   wicked. If God does not immediately restrain it, we are either
   stupified and dismayed, or cast down into despair. But David, from
   this, rather finds matter of encouragement and confi-dence. The greater
   the lawlessness with which his enemies proceeded against him, the more
   earnestly did he supplicate preservation from God, whose office it is
   to destroy all the wicked, because he hates all wickedness. Let all the
   godly, therefore, learn, as often as they have to contend against
   violence, deceit, and injustice, to raise their thoughts to God in
   order to encourage themselves in the certain hope of deliverance,
   according as Paul also exhorts them in 2 Thessalonians 1:5, "Which is,"
   says he, "a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye
   may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
   seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
   them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us." And
   assuredly he would not be the judge of the world if there were not laid
   up in store with him a recompense for all the ungodly. One use, then,
   which may be made of this doctrine is this, -- when we see the wicked
   indulging themselves in their lusts, and when, in consequence, doubts
   steal into our minds as to whether God takes any care of us, we should
   learn to satisfy ourselves with the consideration that God, who hates
   and abhors all iniquity, will not permit them to pass unpunished, and
   although he bear with them for a time, he will at length ascend into
   the judgment-seat, and show himself an avenger, as he is the protector
   and defender of his people. [73] Again, we may infer from this passage
   the common doctrine, that God, although he works by Satan and by the
   ungodly, and makes use of their malice for executing his judgments, is
   not, on this account, the author of sin, nor is pleased with it because
   the end which he purposes is always righteous; and he justly condemns
   and punishes those who, by his mysterious providence, are driven
   whithersoever he pleases.

   In the 4th verse some take r, ra, in the masculine gender, for a wicked
   man; but I understand it rather of wickedness itself David declares
   simply, that there is no agreement between God and unrighteousness. He
   immediately after proceeds to speak of the men themselves, saying, the
   foolish shall not stand in thy sight; and it is a very just inference
   from this, that iniquity its hateful to God, and that, therefore, he
   will execute just punishment upon all the wicked. He calls those fools,
   according to a frequent use of the term in Scripture, who, impelled by
   blind passion, rush headlong into sin. Nothing is more foolish, than
   for the ungodly to cast away the fear of God, and suffer the desire of
   doing mischief to be their ruling principle; yea, there is no madness
   worse than the contempt of God, under the influence of which men
   pervert all right. David sets this truth before himself for his own
   comfort; but we also may draw from it doctrine very useful in training
   us to the fear of God; for the Holy Spirit, by declaring God to be the
   avenger of wickedness, puts a bridle upon us, to restrain us from
   committing sin, in the vain hope of escaping with impunity.

   Psalm 5:7

   7. And I, in the multitude [or abundance] of thy mercy, will enter into
   thy house; I will worship in thy holy temple in thy fear.


   Some think that the word and, by which this sentence is joined to the
   preceding, is put for but; as if David, comparing himself with the
   ungodly, declared and assured himself that God would be merciful to
   him, while he abhorred and would destroy the wicked. But I leave it to
   my readers to judge whether it does not suit the passage better to
   consider this verse as an inference from what goes before, which might
   be put in this form: "O Lord, thou canst not bear with the wicked;
   when, therefore, I am saved out of their hands by thy power, I will
   come to present myself before thee in thy temple, to give thee thanks
   for the deliverance which thou hast vouchsafed to me." If the former
   interpretation be preferred, then the prophet, by simply commending his
   own piety towards God, separates himself from the class of whom he
   spoke. The scope of the passage leads us to understand him as promising
   to give thanks to God. He had before spoken of his enemies as hated of
   God; and now, being persuaded that God will keep him in safety, he
   calls himself to the exercise of gratitude. I will come into thy
   temples says he, in the multitude of thy mercy; as if he had said, I
   may now seem to be in a condition almost desperate, but by the favor of
   God, I shall be kept in perfect safety. This passage, therefore,
   teaches us, that when we are afflicted by the most distressing
   temptations, we ought to set the grace of God before our eyes, in order
   thereby to be supported with the hope of the divine interposition
   amidst the greatest dangers. Farther, as our carnal minds either
   wickedly undervalue the grace of God, or put the low estimate upon it
   which is commonly put by the world, let us learn to extol its wonderful
   greatness, which is sufficient to enable us to overcome all fears. The
   primary object of David was to encourage himself in the assured hope of
   preservation from the mercy of God; but at the same time he shows, that
   upon obtaining deliverance, he will be grateful to God for it, and keep
   it in remembrance. And as hypocrites, in giving thanks to God, do
   nothing else but profane his name, inasmuch as they themselves are
   unholy and polluted, he therefore resolves to come in the fear of God,
   in order to worship him with a sincere and upright heard. Again, we may
   hence draw the general truth, that it is only through the goodness of
   God that we have access to him; and that no man prays aright but he
   who, having experienced his grace, believes and is fully persuaded that
   he will be merciful to him. The fear of God is at the same time added,
   in order to distinguish genuine and godly trust from the vain
   confidence of the flesh.

   Psalm 5:8-10

   8. O Jehovah, lead me forth in thy righteousness, because of mine
   adversaries: make thy way straight before my face. 9. For there is no
   faithfulness in their mouth; their inward parts are very wickedness;
   their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they deal
   deceitfully 10. Cause them to err, O God; let them fall from their
   counsels; destroy them in the multitude [74] of their transgressions;
   for they have rebelled against thee.


   8. O Jehovah, lead me forth, etc. Some explain these words thus: Show
   me what is right, and make me wholly devoted to the practice of that
   righteousness which adorns thy character; and do this because of my
   adversaries; for the saints, impelled by the wicked practice and
   deceitful arts of the ungodly, are in danger of turning aside from the
   right way. This meaning is unquestionably a pious and a useful one. But
   the other interpretation is more suitable, which views the words as a
   prayer that God would lead his servant in safety through the midst of
   the snares of his enemies, and open up to him a way of escape, even
   when, to all appearance, he was caught and surrounded on every side.
   The righteousness of God, therefore, in this passage, as in many
   others, is to be understood of his faithfulness and mercy which he
   shows in defending and preserving his people. Consequently, in thy
   righteousness means the same thing as for or according to thy
   righteousness. David, desiring to have God as the guide of his path,
   encourages himself in the hope of obtaining his request, because God is
   righteous; as if he had said, Lord, as thou art righteous, defend me
   with thine aid, that I may escape from the wicked plots of my enemies.
   Of the same import is the last clause of the verse, where he prays that
   the way of God may be made straight before his face, in other words,
   that he might be delivered by the power of God from the distresses with
   which he was so completely surrounded, that, according to the judgment
   of the flesh, he never expected to find a way of escape. And thus he
   acknowledges how impossible it was for him to avoid being entangled in
   the snares of his enemies, [75] unless God both gave him wisdom, and
   opened up for him a way where no way is. It becomes us, after his
   example, to do the same thing; so that distrusting ourselves when
   counsel fails us, and the malice and wickedness of our enemies prevail,
   we may betake ourselves speedily to God, in whose hands are the issues
   of death, as we shall see afterwards, (Psalm 69:1.)

   9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. He still repeats the
   same complaints which he made before, in order thereby to render his
   enemies the more odious in the sight of God, and to call forth in his
   own behalf the mercy of God, who has promised to succor those who are
   unjustly oppressed. And this is to be particularly attended to, that
   the more our enemies manifest their cruelty against us, or the more
   wickedly they vex us, we ought, with so much the greater confidence, to
   send up our groanings to heaven, because God will not suffer their rage
   to proceed to the uttermost, but will bring forth their malice and
   wicked devices to the light. In the first place, he accuses them of
   treachery, because they speak nothing uprightly, or in sincerity; and
   the cause which he assigns for this is, that inwardly they are full of
   iniquity. He next compares them to sepulchres, their throat is an open
   sepulcher; as if he had said, they are devouring gulfs; [76] meaning by
   this, their insatiable desire of shedding blood. In the close of the
   verse, he again speaks of their deceitfulness. From all this we
   conclude, that the wrongs with which he was tried were of no ordinary
   kind, but that he had to contend with enemies the most wickedly who had
   neither humanity nor moderation. Being so miserably oppressed, he not
   only perseveres in prayer, but finds ground of hope even from the
   confusion and apparent hopelessness of his outward condition.

   When Paul, (Romans 3:13,) in quoting this passage, extends it to all
   mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, he does not give to it a meaning of
   greater latitude than the Holy Spirit intended to give. Since he takes
   it as an undeniable point, that under the person of David, there is
   here described to us the church, both in the person of Christ, who is
   the head, and in his members, it follows that all those ought to be
   reckoned among the number of his enemies, who have not been regenerated
   by the Spirit of God, whether they are without the pale of the visible
   church, or within it. For David, in this passage, does not summons
   either the Assyrians or the Egyptians to the judgment-seat of God, but
   the degenerate Jews, who, being circumcised in the flesh, gloried in
   their descent from the holy lineage of Abraham. Paul, therefore, does
   not wrest these words from their genuine meaning when he applies them
   to all mankind, but asserts, with truth, that David showed in them what
   is the character of the whole human family by nature.

   10. Cause them to err. As the Hebrew word 'sm asam, signifies to cut up
   or to destroy, as well as to sin, and is taken metaphorically for to
   err, or be deceived, either of these senses is suitable in this
   passage; but, as David immediately after subjoins, Let them fall from
   their counsels, I have no doubt but this first prayer is allied and
   similar to the second. I therefore join these two clauses together, as
   the cause and the effect. In the first, he prays that God would deprive
   them of their understanding, and drive them into error; and in the
   second, he prays that, as the effect of this, their counsels might come
   to nought, in other words, that their undertakings might prove
   unsuccessful. [77] For how is it that the ungodly take counsel in vain,
   and are carried hither and thither without consideration or judgment,
   and become so basely obstinate, if it is not because the Lord takes
   them unawares in their own craftiness, breaks their artful schemes,
   intoxicates them with the spirit of phrenzy and giddiness, so that they
   act foolishly even in the smallest matters? If, therefore, we are
   afraid of the snares and deceits of men, and if we find those who
   desire to do us mischief to be clear-headed and sharp-witted persons,
   let us remember, that it is the continual office of God to strike with
   stupidity and madness those who are wise to commit iniquity. Thus it
   will come to pass, that although we may be asleep the Lord will
   dissipate with the breath of his mouth their devices, be they never so
   subtle, and, in the end, expose them to the mockery of the whole world.
   In short, David wishes God to lay his hand upon his enemies, and to put
   a stop to their wicked deliberations. And in fact it is necessary that
   God bring to nothing the schemes which the wicked cunningly devise,
   since it is Satan, the contriver of all deceits, who suggests to them
   all their methods of doing mischief. By praying Let them fall from
   their counsels he means that they may not obtain or accomplish what
   they had determined. Again, he prays to God to punish them as they
   deserved, because, in wrongfully and wickedly making war against an
   innocent person, they rebelled against God. The proud, indeed, never
   think of this, that the poor, whom they afflict and despise, are of
   such estimation in the sight of God, that he feels himself insulted and
   injured in their persons: for they do not imagine that the blows aimed
   at them are struck against heaven, any more than if they trampled a
   little dust or clay under their feet. But God bestows upon his servants
   the inestimable reward of taking their cause into his own hand.
   Whoever, therefore, has an approving conscience, and does not turn
   aside from his uprightness, although troubled wrongfully, has no reason
   to doubt of his warrant to improve God as a buckler against his
   enemies.

   Psalm 5:11-12

   11. And let all rejoice who put their trust in thee, yea, let them
   rejoice for ever; and cover thou them, and let those that love thy name
   delight in thee. [78] 12. For thou, O Jehovah, shalt bless the
   righteous, thou shalt encompass them with thy loving kindness as with a
   shield.


   11. And let all rejoice, etc It makes little difference as to the
   sense, whether we read these words in the future tense, All shall
   rejoice, etc., or in the optative mood, Let all rejoice, etc.; for in
   both ways the meaning of the prophet will be the same; namely, that if
   God deliver him, the fruit of this deliverance will be common to all
   the godly; as if he had said Lord, if thou succourest me, the goodness
   which thou conferrest upon me will not rest on me alone, but will
   extend to all thy servants: for this will serve the more to confirm
   their faith, and make them praise thy name the more. In order,
   therefore, to induce God to grant him deliverance, he employs as an
   argument the end or effect which it would produce, inasmuch as it would
   stir up all the godly to exercise greater trust in God, and encourage
   them to give praise and thanks to him. This passage teaches us, that we
   are ungrateful to God if we do not take encouragement and comfort from
   whatever blessings he confers upon our neighbours, since by these he
   testifies that he will always be ready to bestow his goodness upon all
   the godly in common. Accordingly the reason of this joy is added,
   because the Lord will cover or protect them. As often as God bestows
   any blessings upon any of the faithful, the rest, as I have said
   before, ought to conclude that he will show himself beneficent towards
   them. Again, this passage teaches us, that true joy proceeds from no
   other source than from the protection of God. We may be exposed to a
   thousand deaths, but this one consideration ought abundantly to suffice
   us, that we are covered and defended by the hand of God. And this will
   be the case, if the vain shadows of this world do not so beguile us as
   to excite us to take shelter under them. We ought also particularly to
   notice the statement, that those who trust in the Lord love his name.
   The remembrance of God must be sweet to us, and fill our hearts with
   joy, or rather ravish us with love to him, after he has caused us to
   taste of his goodness; as, on the other hand, all unbelievers wish the
   name of God to be buried, and shun the remembrance of him with horror.

   12. For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous. The Psalmist here
   confirms the concluding sentence of the preceding verse, namely, that
   all the servants of God in common will take support to their faith from
   what he had experienced, for he would have us from one example to form
   our judgment of the immutability and perpetuity of God's grace towards
   all the godly. Again, by this he teaches us that there is no true and
   right joy but that which is derived from the sense of God's fatherly
   love. The word, to bless, in Hebrew, (when we speak of this as the act
   of men,) signifies to wish happiness and prosperity to any one, and to
   pray for him; [79] but when it is spoken of as the act of God, it
   signifies the same thing as to prosper a man, or to enrich him
   abundantly with all good things; for since the favor of God is
   efficacious, his blessing of itself produces an abundance of every good
   thing. The name righteous is not restricted to any one man, but
   signifies in general all the servants of God. Those, however, who are
   called righteous in Scripture, are not so called on account of the
   merit of their works, but because they aspire after righteousness; for
   after God has received them into his favor, by not imputing their sins
   to them, he accepts their upright endeavors for perfect righteousness.
   What follows is of the same import as the preceding clause, Thou wilt
   crown them with thy free favor, or good will, as with a shield The
   Psalmist's meaning is, that the faithful shall be completely defended
   on all sides, since he will, in no case, withhold from them his grace,
   which is to them an invincible fortress, and brings along with it
   certain safety. The word, to crown, which the Psalmist employs, often
   denotes in Hebrew, ornament or glory; but as there is added the
   similitude of a shield, I have no doubt but he uses it metaphorically
   for, to fortify or to compass about. [80] The meaning, therefore, is,
   that however great and various may be the dangers which besiege the
   righteous, they shall, notwithstanding, escape, and be saved, because
   God is favorable to them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [78] In the older Latin editions, and in the French edition, the verbs
   for rejoice and delight are rendered, on the margin, in the future
   tense, thus:-- "And all who trust in thee shall rejoice; yea, they
   shall rejoice for ever; and cover thou them, and those that love thy
   name shall delight in thee."

   [79] "Signifie, souhaitter bien et prosperite a quelquun et prier pour
   luy." -- Fr.

   [80] Bishop Horsley thinks ktsnh, katsinah, as with a shield, should be
   construed with rtsvn ratson, favor or good will, and translates the
   words thus: "Like a shield of good will, thou wilt stand guard around
   him." The reading of the Septuagint is the same: Os hoplo eudokias, as
   with a shield of good will. The word tsnh tsinah, means that kind of
   shield, from the middle of which there arose a large boss, surmounted
   by a dagger and which was highly useful both as a defensive and an
   offensive weapon in ancient warfare.

   PSALM 6.

   David, being afflicted by the hand of God, acknowledges that he had
   provoked the Divine wrath by his sins, and, therefore, in order to
   obtain relief, he prays for forgiveness. At the same time, he regrets,
   that by being taken out of the world, he would be deprived of an
   opportunity of praising God. Then, having obtained confidence, he
   celebrates the grace of God, and directs his discourse to his enemies,
   who triumphed over his calamities.

   To the chief musician on Neginoth, upon the eighth. A song of David.

   The name of Song shows that David composed this psalm, in which he
   describes the passionate workings of his grief in the time of his
   troubles after he had obtained deliverance from the evils which he
   deplores. What the kind of chastisement was of which he speaks is
   uncertain. Those who restrict it to bodily disease do not adduce in
   support of their opinion any argument of sufficient weight. They insist
   on the word 'ml, amal, which occurs in verse third, where he says, "I
   am weak," which indeed signifies to be sick; but it is more probable
   that it is here used metaphorically. They allege that Hezekiah, after
   his recovery from sickness, sung in the same strains as are here
   recorded, concerning death. But in ^&lt;19B601&gt;Psalm 116, where no
   mention is made of bodily disease, the same complaint is uttered by the
   Psalmist in the name of the whole Church. We can, indeed, gather from
   these words that the life of David was in the utmost danger, but it may
   have been some other kind of affliction than bodily sickness under
   which he labored. We may, therefore, adopt this as the more certain
   interpretation, that he had been stricken by some severe calamity, or
   that some punishment had been inflicted upon him, which presented to
   his view on every side only the shadow of death. It ought also to be
   considered, that this psalm was not composed at the very time when he
   presented to God the prayers recorded in it; but that the prayers which
   he had meditated and uttered in the midst of his dangers and sadness
   were, after he had obtained respite, committed to writing. This
   explains why he joins the sorrow with which he certainly had struggled
   for a time with the joy which he afterwards experienced. With respect
   to the word eighth, as we have before said that ngynvt, Neginoth,
   signifies a musical instrument, I do not know whether it would be
   correct to say, that it was a harp of eight strings. I am rather
   inclined to the opinion that it refers to the tune, and points out the
   particular kind of music to which the psalm was to be sung. [81]
   However, in a matter so obscure and of so little importance I leave
   every one at liberty to form his own conjecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 6:1

   1. Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, and chastise me not in thine
   indignation.


   The calamity which David now experienced had, perhaps, been inflicted
   by men, but he wisely considers that he has to deal with God. Those
   persons are very unsuitably exercised under their afflictions who do
   not immediately take a near and a steady view of their sins, in order
   thereby to produce the conviction that they have deserved the wrath of
   God. And yet we see how thoughtless and insensible almost all men are
   on this subject; for while they cry out that they are afflicted and
   miserable, scarcely one among a hundred looks to the hand which
   strikes. From whatever quarter, therefore, our afflictions come, let us
   learn to turn our thoughts instantly to God, and to acknowledge him as
   the Judge who summons us as guilty before his tribunal, since we, of
   our own accord, do not anticipate his judgment. But as men, when they
   are compelled to feel that God is angry with them, often indulge in
   complaints full of impiety, rather than find fault with themselves and
   their own sins, it is to be particularly noticed that David does not
   simply ascribe to God the afflictions under which he is now suffering,
   but acknowledges them to be the just recompense of his sins. He does
   not take God to task as if he had been an enemy, treating him with
   cruelty without any just cause; but yielding to him the right of
   rebuking and chastening, he desires and prays only that bounds may be
   set to the punishment inflicted on him. By this he declares God to be a
   just Judge in taking vengeance on the sins of men. [82] But as soon as
   he has confessed that he is justly chastised, he earnestly beseeches
   God not to deal with him in strict justice, or according to the utmost
   rigour of the law. He does not altogether refuse punishment, for that
   would be unreasonable; and to be without it, he judged would be more
   hurtful than beneficial to him: but what he is afraid of is the wrath
   of God, which threatens sinners with ruin and perdition. To anger and
   indignation David tacitly opposes fatherly and gentle chastisement, and
   this last he was willing to bear. We have a similar contrast in the
   words of Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 10:24,) "O Lord," says he, "correct me,
   but with judgment; not in thine anger." God is, indeed, said to be
   angry with sinners whenever he inflicts punishment upon them, but not
   in the proper and strict sense, inasmuch as he not only mingles with it
   some of the sweetness of his grace to mitigate their sorrow, but also
   shows himself favorable to them, in moderating their punishment, and in
   mercifully drawing back his hand. But, as we must necessarily be
   stricken with terror whenever he shows himself the avenger of
   wickedness, it is not without cause that David, according to the sense
   of the flesh, is afraid of his anger and indignation. The meaning
   therefore is this: I indeed confess, O Lord, that I deserve to be
   destroyed and brought to nought; but as I would be unable to endure the
   severity of thy wrath, deal not with me according to my deserts, but
   rather pardon my sins, by which I have provoked thine anger against me.
   As often, then, as we are pressed down by adversity, let us learn, from
   the example of David, to have recourse to this remedy, that we may be
   brought into a state of peace with God; for it is not to be expected
   that it can be well or prosperous with us if we are not interested in
   his favor. Whence it follows, that we shall never be without a load of
   evils, until he forgive us our sins.

   Psalm 6:2-3

   2. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am weak; heal me, O Jehovah,
   for my bones are afraid. 3. And my soul is exceedingly troubled; [83]
   and thou, O Jehovah, how long? [84]


   2. Have mercy upon me. As he earnestly calls upon God to be merciful to
   him, it is from this the more clearly manifest, that by the terms anger
   and indignation he did not mean cruelty or undue severity, but only
   such judgment as God executes upon the reprobate, whom he does not
   spare in mercy as he does his own children. If he had complained of
   being unjustly and too severely punished, he would now have only added
   something to this effect: Restrain thyself, that in punishing me thou
   mayest not exceed the measure of my offense. In betaking himself,
   therefore, to the mercy of God alone, he shows that he desires nothing
   else than not to be dealt with according to strict justice, or as he
   deserved. In order to induce God to exercise his forgiving mercy
   towards him, he declares that he is ready to fail: Have mercy upon me,
   O Jehovah, for I am weak As I have said before, he calls himself weak,
   not because he was sick, but because he was cast down and broken by
   what had now befallen him. And as we know that the design of God in
   inflicting punishment upon us, is to humble us; so, whenever we are
   subdued under his rod, the gate is opened for his mercy to come to us.
   Besides, since it is his peculiar office to heal the diseased to raise
   up the fallen, to support the weak, and, finally, to give life to the
   dead; this, of itself, is a sufficient reason why we should seek his
   favor, that we are sinking under our afflictions.

   After David has protested that he placed his hope of salvation in the
   mercy of God alone, and has sorrowfully set forth how much he is
   abased, he subjoins the effect which this had in impairing his bodily
   health, and prays for the restoration of this blessing: Heal me, O
   Jehovah And this is the order which we must observe, that we may know
   that all the blessings which we ask from God flow from the fountain of
   his free goodness, and that we are then, and then only, delivered from
   calamities and chastisements, [85] when he has had mercy upon us. --
   For my bones are afraid This confirms what I have just now observed,
   namely, that, from the very grievousness of his afflictions, he
   entertained the hope of some relief; for God, the more he sees the
   wretched oppressed and almost overwhelmed, is just so much the more
   ready to succor them. He attributes fear to his bones, not because they
   are endued with feeling, but because the vehemence of his grief was
   such that it affected his whole body. He does not speak of his flesh,
   which is the more tender and susceptible part of the corporeal system,
   but he mentions his bones, thereby intimating that the strongest parts
   of his frame were made to tremble for fear. He next assigns the cause
   of this by saying, And my soul is greatly afraid. The connective
   particle and, in my judgment, has here the meaning of the causal
   particle for, as if he had said, so severe and violent is the inward
   anguish of my heart, that it affects and impairs the strength of every
   part of my body. I do not approve of the opinion which here takes soul
   for life, nor does it suit the scope of the passage.

   3. And thou, O Jehovah, how long? This elliptical form of expression
   serves to express more strongly the vehemence of grief, which not only
   holds the minds of men bound up, but likewise their tongues, breaking
   and cutting short their speech in the middle of the sentence. The
   meaning, however, in this abrupt expression is doubtful. Some, to
   complete the sentence, supply the words, Wilt thou afflict me, or
   continue to chasten me? Others read, How long wilt thou delay thy
   mercy? But what is stated in the next verse shows that this second
   sense is the more probable, for he there prays to the Lord to look upon
   him with an eye of favor and compassion. He, therefore, complains that
   God has now forsaken him, or has no regard to him, just as God seems to
   be far of from us whenever his assistance or grace does not actually
   manifest itself in our behalf. God, in his compassion towards us,
   permits us to pray to him to make haste to succor us; but when we have
   freely complained of his long delay, that our prayers or sorrow, on
   this account, may not pass beyond bounds we must submit our case
   entirely to his will, and not wish him to make greater haste than shall
   seem good to him.

   Psalm 6:4-5

   4. Return, O Lord, deliver my soul; save me for thy mercy's sake. 5.
   For in death there is no remembrance of thee; and in the grave who
   shall acknowledge thee? [86]


   4. Return, O Lord. In the preceding verses the Psalmist bewailed the
   absence of God, and now he earnestly requests the tokens of his
   presence, for our happiness consists in this, that we are the objects
   of the Divine regard, but we think he is alienated from us, if he does
   not give us some substantial evidence of his care for us. That David
   was at this time in the utmost peril, we gather from these words, in
   which he prays both for the deliverance of his soul, as it were, from
   the jaws of death, and for his restoration to a state of safety. Yet no
   mention is made of any bodily disease, and, therefore, I give no
   judgment with respect to the kind of his affliction. David, again,
   confirms what he had touched upon in the second verse concerning the
   mercy of God, namely, that this is the only quarter from which he hopes
   for deliverance: Save me for thy mercy's sake Men will never find a
   remedy for their miseries until, forgetting their own merits, by
   trusting to which they only deceive themselves, they have learned to
   betake themselves to the free mercy of God.

   5. For in death there is no remembrance of thee. After God has bestowed
   all things freely upon us, he requires nothing in return but a grateful
   remembrance of his benefits. To this gratitude reference is made when
   David says, that there will be no remembrance of God in death, nor any
   celebration of his praise in the grave His meaning is, that if, by the
   grace of God, he shall be delivered from death, he will be grateful for
   it, and keep it in remembrance. And he laments, that if he should be
   removed out of the world, he would be deprived of the power and
   opportunity of manifesting his gratitude, since in that case he would
   no longer mingle in the society of men, there to commend or celebrate
   the name of God. From this passage some conclude, that the dead have no
   feeling, and that it is wholly extinct in them; but this is a rash and
   unwarranted inference, for nothing is here treated of but the mutual
   celebration of the grace of God, in which men engage while they
   continue in the land of the living. We know that we are placed on the
   earth to praise God with one mind and one mouth, and that this is the
   end of our life. Death, it is true, puts an end to such praises; but it
   does not follow from this, that the souls of the faithful, when
   divested of their bodies, are deprived of understanding, or touched
   with no affection towards God. It is also to be considered, that, on
   the present occasion, David dreaded the judgment of God if death should
   befall him, and this made him dumb as to singing the praises of God. It
   is only the goodness of God sensibly experienced by us which opens our
   mouth to celebrate his praise; and whenever, therefore, joy and
   gladness are taken away, praises also must cease. It is not then
   wonderful if the wrath of God, which overwhelms us with the fear of
   eternal destruction, is said to extinguish in us the praises of God.

   From this passage, we are furnished with the solution of another
   question, why David so greatly dreaded death, as if there had been
   nothing to hope for beyond this world. Learned men reckon up three
   causes why the fathers under the law were so much kept in bondage by
   the fear of death. The first is, because the grace of God, not being
   then made manifest by the coming of Christ, the promises, which were
   obscure, gave them only a slight acquaintance with the life to come.
   The second is, because the present life, in which God deals with us as
   a Father, is of itself desirable. And the third, because they were
   afraid lest, after their decease, some change to the worse might take
   place in religion. But to me these reasons do not appear to be
   sufficiently solid. David's mind was not always occupied by the fear he
   now felt; and when he came to die, being full of days and weary of this
   life, he calmly yielded up his soul into the bosom of God. The second
   reason is equally applicable to us at the present day, as it was to the
   ancient fathers, inasmuch as God's fatherly love shines forth towards
   us also even in this life, and with much more illustrious proofs than
   under the former dispensation. But, as I have just observed, I consider
   this complaint of David as including something different, namely, that
   feeling the hand of God to be against him, and knowing his hatred of
   sin, [87] he is overwhelmed with fear and involved in the deepest
   distress. The same may also be said of Hezekiah, inasmuch as he did not
   simply pray for deliverance from death, but from the wrath of God,
   which he felt to be very awful, (Isaiah 38:3.)

   Psalm 6:6-7

   6. I have become wearied in my groaning; I make my bed to swim [88]
   every night; I water my couch with my tears. 7. Mine eye hath waxed dim
   for vexation; it hath waxed old among my persecutors.


   These forms of expression are hyperbolical, but it must not be imagined
   that David, after the manner of poets, exaggerates his sorrow; [89] but
   he declares truly and simply how severe and bitter it had been. It
   should always be kept in mind, that his affliction did not proceed so
   much from his having been severely wounded with bodily distress; but
   regarding God as greatly displeased with him, he saw, as it were, hell
   open to receive him; and the mental distress which this produces
   exceeds all other sorrows. Indeed, the more sincerely a man is devoted
   to God, he is just so much the more severely disquieted by the sense of
   his wrath; and hence it is that holy persons, who were otherwise endued
   with uncommon fortitude, have showed in this respect the greatest
   softness and want of resolution. And nothing prevents us at this day
   from experiencing in ourselves what David describes concerning himself
   but the stupidity of our flesh. Those who have experienced, even in a
   moderate degree, what it is to contend with the fear of eternal death,
   will be satisfied that there is nothing extravagant in these words. Let
   us, therefore, know that here David is represented to us as being
   afflicted with the terrors of his conscience, [90] and feeling within
   him torment of no ordinary kind, but such as made him almost faint
   away, and lie as if dead. With respect to the words, he says, Mine eye
   hath waxed dim; for grief of mind easily makes its way to the eyes, and
   from them very distinctly shows itself. As the word tq athak, which I
   have translated it hath waxed old, sometimes signifies to depart from
   one's place, some expound it, that the goodness of his eyesight was
   lost, and his sight, as it were, had vanished. Others understand by it
   that his eyes were hidden by the swelling which proceeds from weeping.
   The first opinion, however, according to which David complains of his
   eyes failing him, as it were, through old age, appears to me the more
   simple. As to what he adds, every night, we learn from it that he was
   almost wholly wasted away with protracted sorrow, and yet all the while
   never ceased from praying to God.

   Psalm 6:8-10

   8. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard
   the voice of my weeping. 9. The Lord hath heard my supplication; the
   Lord will receive [91] my prayer. 10. Let all mine enemies be put to
   shame and greatly confounded; let them turn back, and be ashamed
   suddenly. [92]


   After David has disburdened his griefs and troubles into the bosom of
   God, he now, as it were, assumes a new character. And, without doubt,
   he had been afflicted with long-continued despondency of spirit before
   he could recover himself, and attain to such a degree of assurance as
   he here displays; [93] for we have already seen that he had spent many
   nights in continual weeping. Now, the more he had been distressed and
   wearied by the long delay of his deliverance, with so much the more
   alacrity does he stir up himself to sing of victory. Directing his
   discourse against his adversaries, he represents it as not the least
   part of his temptations that ungodly men triumphed over him, and
   derided him as lost, and in a hopeless condition; for we know with what
   insolence their pride and cruelty magnify themselves against the
   children of God, when they see them oppressed under the cross. And to
   this Satan moves them, in order to drive the faithful to despair, when
   they see their hope made the subject of mockery. This passage teaches
   us, that the grace of God is the only light of life to the godly; and
   that, as soon as He has manifested some token of his anger, they are
   not only greatly afraid, but also, as it were, plunged into the
   darkness of death; while, on the other hand, as soon as they discover
   anew that God is merciful to them, they are immediately restored to
   life. David, it is to be noticed, repeats three times that his prayers
   were heard, by which he testifies that he ascribes his deliverance to
   God, and confirms himself in this confidence, that he had not betaken
   himself to God in vain. And if we would receive any fruit from our
   prayers, we must believe that God's ears have not been shut against
   them. By the word weeping, [94] he not only indicates vehemence and
   earnestness, but also intimates that he had been wholly occupied in
   mourning and sorrowful lamentations. The confidence and security which
   David takes to himself from the favor of God ought also to be noticed.
   From this, we are taught that there is nothing in the whole world,
   whatever it may be, and whatever opposition it may make to us, [95]
   which we may not despise, if we are fully persuaded of our being
   beloved by God; and by this also we understand what his fatherly love
   can do for us. By the adverb suddenly, he signifies, that when there is
   apparently no means of delivering the faithful from affliction, and
   when all seems desperate or hopeless, then they are delivered by the
   power of God contrary to all expectation. When God suddenly changes
   men's afflicted condition into one of joy and happiness, he thereby
   manifests more illustriously his power, and makes it appear the more
   wonderful.

   PSALM 7

   David, loaded with unjust calumny, calls upon God to be his advocate
   and defender, and commits his innocence to the Divine protection. In
   the first place, he protests that his conscience did notaccuse him of
   the wickedness laid to his charge. Secondly, he shows how greatly it
   concerns the glory of God that he should execute judgment against the
   ungodly. Thirdly, to inspire his mind with confidence, he seriously
   reflects upon the goodness and righteousness of God, and sets before
   him the divine promises. Lastly, as if he had obtained the desire of
   his heart, he derides the folly and the vain attempts of his enemies;
   or rather, depending upon the aid of God, he assures himself that all
   their endeavours against him shall turn to their own destruction.

   Shiggaion of David, which he sung unto Jehovah,
   upon the words of Cush the Benjamite.

   With respect to the word Shiggaion, the Jewish interpreters are not
   agreed. Some understand it to mean a musical instrument. To others it
   seems to be a tune to which a song is set. Others suppose it to have
   been the beginning of a common song, to the tune of which David wished
   this psalm to be sung. Others translate the Hebrew word, delight, or
   rejoicing. [96] The second opinion appears to me the most probable,
   namely, that it was some kind of melody or song, as if one should term
   it Sapphic or Phaleucian verse. [97] But I do not contend about a
   matter of so small importance. Again, the psalm is said to have been
   composed upon the words of Cush. I cannot subscribe to the
   interpretation, (although it is the commonly received one,) that words
   here mean affairs, or business. To put word for a matter, or an affair,
   is, I allow, a common form of speech among the Jews; but as David a
   little after declares that he was falsely accused of some crime, I
   doubt not but he here speaks of the accusation or calumny itself, of
   which, as I judge, Cush, some one of Saul's kindred, was the author,
   or, at least, the instrument who preferred and circulated it. The
   opinion of some who say that Saul is here spoken of under a fictitious
   name, is not supported by any argument of sufficient weight. According
   to them, David avoided calling him by his own name, in order to spare
   the royal dignity. David, I admit, had great reverence for the holy
   anointing; but as he expressly names Saul in other places where he
   reprehends him not less severely, and paints him in colours no less
   black than he does in this psalm, why should he suppress his name here,
   and not in these passages? In my opinion, therefore, he here expresses
   by his proper name, and without figure, a wicked accuser, who had
   excited hatred against him by falsely charging him with some crime, and
   who had either been bribed by the king to do this, or, currying the
   royal favour, had calumniated David of his own accord; for David, we
   know, was very much slandered, as if he had been ungrateful and
   treacherous towards the king, his father-in-law. Saul, indeed, belonged
   to the tribe of Benjamin. We do not, however, think that he is the
   person here mentioned, but that it was one of Saul's relations, one who
   belonged to the same tribe with him, who falsely accused David.

   Psalm 7:1-2

   1. O Jehovah, my God, in thee do I trust: save me from all them that
   persecute me, and deliver me. 2. Lest he seize upon my soul as a lion,
   and tear it in pieces, while there is none to deliver it.


   At the commencement of the psalm, David speaks of having many enemies,
   and in the second verse he specifies some one in the singular number.
   And certainly, since the minds of all men were inflamed against him, he
   had very good reason for praying to be delivered from all his
   persecutors. But as the wicked cruelty of the king, like a firebrand,
   had kindled against him, though an innocent person, the hatred of the
   whole people, he had good reason also for turning his pen particularly
   against him. Thus, in the first verse, he describes the true character
   of his own circumstances--he was a persecuted man; and, in the second
   verse, the fountain or cause of the calamity he was enduring. There is
   great emphasis in these words which he uses in the beginning of the
   Psalms O Jehovah my Godly in thee do I trust. The verb, it is true, is
   in the past tense in the Hebrew; and, therefore, if literally
   translated, the reading would be, In thee have I trusted; but as the
   Hebrews often take one tense for another, [98] I prefer to translate it
   in the present, In thee I do trust, especially since it is abundantly
   evident that a continued act, as it is termed, is denoted. David does
   not boast of a confidence in God, from which he had now fallen, but of
   a confidence which he constantly entertained in his afflictions. And
   this is a genuine and an undoubted proof of our faith, when, being
   visited with adversity, we, notwithstanding, persevere in cherishing
   and exercising hope in God. From this passage, we also learn that the
   gate of mercy is shut against our prayers if the key of faith do not
   open it for us. Nor does he use superfluous language when he calls
   Jehovah his own God; for by setting up this as a bulwark before him, he
   beats back the waves of temptations, that they may not overwhelm his
   faith. In the second verses by the figure of a lion, he represents in a
   stronger light the cruelty of Saul, as an argument to induce God to
   grant him assistance, even as he ascribes it to Him as his peculiar
   province to rescue his poor sheep from the jaws of wolves.

   Psalm 7:3-5

   3. O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity
   in my hands: 4 If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with
   me, and have not delivered him that persecuted me without cause: 5. Let
   the enemy pursue my soul and take it; and let him throw down my life to
   the ground, [99] and hold down [100] my glory in the dust. Selah.


   3 O Jehovah my God Here David, to induce God to show him favour,
   protests that he is molested unjustly, and without being guilty of any
   crime. To give his protestation the greater weight, he uses an
   imprecation. If he has done any wrong, he declares his readiness to
   bear the blame; yea, he offers to endure the severest punishment, if he
   is not altogether innocent of the crime of which all men thought him
   almost convicted. And by entreating God to succour him upon no other
   condition than this, that his integrity should upon trial be found to
   be untarnished, he teaches us, by his example, that as often as we have
   recourse to God, we must make it our first care to be well assured in
   our own consciences with respect to the righteousness of our cause; for
   we do him great wrong if we wish to engage him as the advocate and
   defender of a bad cause. The pronoun this shows that he speaks of a
   thing which was generally known; whence we may conclude, that the
   slander which had been raised by Cush was spread far and wide. And as
   David was condemned, by the false reports and unrighteous judgments
   which men advanced against him, and saw no remedy on earth, he betakes
   himself to the judgment-seat of God, and contents himself with
   maintaining his innocence before the heavenly Judge; an example which
   all the godly should imitate, in order that, in opposition to the
   slanderous reports which are spread against them, they may rest
   satisfied with the judgment of God alone. He next declares more
   distinctly, that he had committed no crime. And in the fourth verse, he
   mentions two particulars in self-vindication; first, That he had done
   no wrong to any one; and, secondly, That he had rather endeavoured to
   do good to his enemies, by whom notwithstanding he had been injured
   without any just cause. I, therefore, explain the fourth verse thus: If
   I have wronged any man that was at peace with me, and have not rather
   succoured the unworthy, who persecuted me without a cause, etc. Since
   David was hated of almost all men, as if ambition to reign had impelled
   him perfidiously to rise up in rebellion against Saul, and to lay
   snares for the monarch to whom he was bound by the oath of allegiances
   [101] in the first part of the verse, he clears himself of such a foul
   slander. The reason, perhaps, why he calls Saul him that was at peace
   with him is, that on account of his royal dignity his person ought to
   be sacred, and secure from danger, [102] so that it should be unlawful
   to make any hostile attempt against him. This phrase, however, may be
   understood generally, as if he had said, No one who has meekly
   restrained himself from injuring me, and has conducted himself kindly
   towards me, can with truth complain that I have ever injured him in a
   single instance. And yet it was the general persuasion, that David, in
   the midst of peace, had stirred up great confusion, and caused war.
   From this it is just so much the more manifest, that David, provided he
   enjoyed the approbation of God, was contented with the consolation
   arising from this, though he should have comfort from no other source.

   In the second clause of the fourth verse, he proceeds farther, and
   states, that he had been a friend, not only to the good, but also to
   the bad, and had not only restrained himself from all revenge, but had
   even succoured his enemies, by whom he had been deeply and cruelly
   injured. It would certainly not be very illustrious virtue to love the
   good and peaceable, unless there were joined to this self-government
   and gentleness in patiently bearing with the bad. But when a man not
   only keeps himself from revenging the injuries which he has received,
   but endeavours to overcome evil by doing good, he manifests one of the
   graces of a renewed and sanctified nature, and in this way proves
   himself to be one of the children of God; for such meekness proceeds
   only from the Spirit of adoption. With respect to the words: as the
   Hebrew word chlts chalats, which I have translated to delivers
   signifies to divide and to separate, some, to prevent the necessity of
   supplying any word to make out the sense, [103] thus explain the
   passage, If I have withdrawn myself from my persecutors, in order not
   to succour them. The other interpretation, however, according to which
   the verb is rendered to deliver or rescue from danger, is more
   generally received; because the phrase, to separate or set aside, is
   applied to those things which we wish to place in safety. And thus the
   negative word not must be supplied, an omission which we will find not
   unfrequently occurring in The Psalms.

   5 Let mine enemy pursue It is a striking proof of the great confidence
   which David had in his own integrity, when he is willing to endure any
   kind of punishment, however dreadful, provided he should be found
   guilty of any crime. If we could bring a good conscience like this
   before God, his hand would be more quickly stretched forth to afford us
   immediate assistance. But as it often happens that those who molest us
   have been provoked by us, or that we burn with the desire of revenge
   when offended, we are unworthy of receiving succour from God; yea, our
   own impatience shuts the gate against our prayers. In the first place,
   David is prepared to be given over to the will of his enemies, that
   they may seize his life, and throw it down to the ground; and then to
   be publicly exhibited as an object of their mockery, so that, even
   after he is dead, he may lie under eternal disgrace. Some think that
   the kvvd kebod, which we have translated glory, is here to be taken for
   life, and thus there will be three words, soul, life, glory, signifying
   the same thing. But it appears to me, that the meaning of the passage
   will be fuller if we refer the word glory to his memory, or his good
   name, as if he had said, Let my enemy not only destroy me, but, after
   having put me to death, let him speak of me in the most reproachful
   terms, so that my name may be buried in mire or filth.

   Psalm 7:6-8

   6. Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger, lift up thyself against the rage
   of mine enemies; and awake thou for me to the judgment which thou hast
   ordained. [104] 7. And then the assembly of peoples [or nations] shall
   compass thee about: and on account of this, return thou on high. 8.
   Jehovah shall judge the peoples, [or nations:] judge me, O Jehovah,
   according to my righteousness, and according to the integrity that is
   in me.


   6 Arise, O Jehovah David here sets the anger of God in opposition to
   the rage of his enemies; and when we are in similar circumstances we
   should act in the same manner. When the ungodly are inflamed against
   us, and cast forth their rage and fury to destroy us, we ought humbly
   to beseech God to be inflamed also on his side; in other words, to show
   in truth that he has, no less zeal and power to preserve us, than they
   have inclination to destroy us. The word, Arise, is taken in a
   figurative sense, for to ascend into a judgment-seat, or rather to
   prepare one's self to make resistance; and it is here applied to God,
   because, while he delays to succour us, we are very apt to think him
   asleep. Accordingly, David also, a little after, beseeches him to
   awake; for it seemed on the part of God something like the
   forgetfulness of sleep to give no assistance to an individual who was
   so much afflicted and oppressed on all hands.

   In the end of the verse he shows that he asks nothing but what is
   according to the appointment of God. And this is the rule which ought
   to be observed by us in our prayers; we should in every thing conform
   our requests to the divine will, as John also instructs us, (1 John
   5:14.) And, indeed, we can never pray in faith unless we attend, in the
   first place, to what God commands, that our minds may not rashly and at
   random start aside in desiring more than we are permitted to desire and
   pray for. David, therefore, in order to pray aright, reposes himself on
   the word and prose mise of God; and the import of his exercise is this:
   Lord, I am not led by ambition, or foolish headstrong passion, or
   depraved desire, inconsiderately to ask from thee whatever is pleasing
   to my flesh; but it is the clear light of thy word which directs me,
   and upon it I securely depend. Since God, of his own good pleasure, had
   called him to be one day king, it belonged to him to defend and
   maintain the rights of the man whom he had chosen for his servant.
   David's language, therefore, is the same as if he had said, "When I was
   well contented with my humble condition in private life, it was thy
   pleasure to set me apart to the honourable station of being a king;
   now, therefore, it belongs to thee to maintain this cause against Saul
   and his associates who are using their efforts to defeat thy decree in
   making war upon me." The Hebrew word vrh, urah, which we have rendered
   awake thou, [105] might also be taken transitively for to build up, or
   to establish the right of David. The sum of the whole, however, comes
   to this, that David, trusting to the call of God, beseeches him to
   stretch forth his hand for his relief. The faithful must, therefore,
   take care not to exceed these bounds, if they desire to have God
   present with them to maintain and preserve them.

   7 And a congregation of peoples Some limit this sentence exclusively to
   the people of Israel, as if David promised that, as soon as he should
   ascend the throne, he would endeavour to reunite together, in the pure
   worship of God, the people who before had been as it were in a state of
   dispersion. Under the reign of Saul, religion had been neglected, or
   such an unrestrained license in wickedness had prevailed, that few paid
   any regard to God. The meaning, therefore, according to these
   expositors, is this: Lord, when thou shalt have constituted me king,
   the whole people, who have so basely gone astray from thee, [106] shall
   return from their wanderings and disorderly courses to thee and to thy
   service, so that all shall know that thou rulest in the midst of them,
   and shall worship thee as their only King. But I am rather inclined to
   view this as language which has a respect in common to many nations.
   David here speaks in high terms of the effects resulting from his
   deliverance, the report of which would be spread far and wide, and his
   words are, as if he had said, "Lord, when thou shalt have put me in
   peaceable possession of the kingdom, this will not only be a benefit
   conferred on me personally, but it will be a common lesson to many
   nations, teaching them to acknowledge thy just judgment, so that they
   shall turn their eyes to thy judgment-seat." [107] David here alludes
   to the practice of a people who surround their king, as in a circle,
   when he holds a solemn assembly. In the same sense, he adds immediately
   after, that God, who, for a time, lay still and kept silence, would
   raise himself on high that not only one or two, but whole nations,
   might behold his glory: And on account of this return thou on high
   [108] There is in these words, a tacit comparison, that although it
   might not be necessary to have a regard to one man alone, it is
   requisite that God should keep the world in the fear and reverence of
   his judgment.

   8 Jehovah shall judge the nations This sentence is closely connected
   with the preceding verse. David had prayed God to show himself as judge
   to the nations; and now he takes it for a certain and admitted truth,
   that it is the peculiar office of God to judge the nations: for the
   word put in the future tense, and rendered shall judge, denotes here a
   continued act; and this is the signification of the future tense in
   general sentences. Besides, he does not here speak of one nation only,
   but comprehends all nations. As he acknowledges God to be the judge of
   the whole world, he concludes a little after from this, that he will
   maintain his cause and right. And as often as we seem to be forsaken
   and oppressed, we should recall this truth to our remembrance, that as
   God is the governor of the world, it is as utterly impossible for him
   to abdicate his office as to deny himself. From this source there will
   flow a continual stream of comfort, although a long succession of
   calamities may press upon us: for from this truth we may assuredly
   conclude, that he will take care to defend our innocence. It would be
   contrary to every principle of just reasoning to supposes that he who
   governs many nations neglects even one man. What happens with respect
   to the judges of this world can never take place with respect to him;
   he cannot, as may be the case with them, be so occupied about great and
   public affairs as to neglect, because unable to attend to them, the
   concerns of individuals. He again brings into new his integrity that he
   may not seem, after the example of hypocrites to make the name of God a
   mere pretext for the better furthering of his own purposes. Since God
   is no respecter of persons, we cannot expect him to be on our side, and
   to favour us, if our cause is not good. But it is asked, how can David
   here boast of his own integrity before God, when in other places he
   deprecates God entering into judgment with him? The answer is easy, and
   it is this: The subject here treated of is not how he could answer if
   God should demand from him an account of his whole life; but, comparing
   himself with his enemies, he maintains and not without cause, that, in
   respect of them, he was righteous. But when each saint passes under the
   review of God's judgment, and his own character is tried upon its own
   merits, the matter is very different, for then the only sanctuary to
   which he can betake himself for safety, is the mercy of God.

   Psalm 7:9-11

   9. Let the malice of the wicked come to an end I beseech thee and
   direct thou the righteous: for God who is righteous, proves [or
   searches] the hearts and the reins. 10. My defense [or shield] is in
   God, who saves the upright in heart. 11. God judgeth the righteous, and
   him who despiseth God, daily.


   9 Let the malice of the wicked come to an endow I beseech thee. David,
   in the first place, prays that God would restrain the malice of his
   enemies, and bring it to an end; from which it follows, that his
   affliction had been of long duration. Others suppose that this is
   rather a dreadful imprecation, and they explain the Hebrew word gmr,
   gamar, somewhat differently. Instead of rendering it to cease, and to
   come to an end, as I have done, they understand it to make to cease,
   which is equivalent to destroy or to consume. [109] Thus, according to
   them, David wishes that God would cause the mischief which the wicked
   devise to fall upon their own heads: Let the wickedness of the wicked
   consume them But, in my opinion, the former interpretation is the more
   simple, namely, that David beseeches God to bring his troubles to a
   termination. Accordingly there follows immediately after the
   corresponding prayer Direct thou the righteous, or establish him; for
   it is of little importance which of these two readings we adopt. The
   meaning is, that God would re-establish and uphold the righteous, who
   are wrongfully oppressed, and thus make it evident that they are
   continued in their estate by the power of God, notwithstanding the
   persecution to which they are subjected.--For God searcheth the hearts
   The Hebrew copulative is here very properly translated by the causal
   particle for, since David, without doubt, adds this clause as an
   argument to enforce his prayer. He now declares, for the third time,
   that, trusting to the testimony of a good conscience, he comes before
   God with confidence; but here he expresses something more than he had
   done before, namely, that he not only showed his innocence, by his
   external conduct, but had also cultivated purity in the secret
   affection of his heart. He seems to set this confidence in opposition
   to the insolence and boasting of his enemies, by whom, it is probable,
   such calumnies had been circulated among the people concerning him, as
   constrained him in his deep affliction to present his heart and reins
   to be tried by God. Perhaps, also, he speaks in this manner, in order
   to divest them of all those plausible but false and deceitful
   pretenses, which they made use of for the purpose of deceiving men, and
   if they succeeded in doing this they were satisfied. [110] He shows
   that, although they might triumph before the world, and receive the
   applause of the multitude, they, nevertheless, gained nothing, inasmuch
   as they would, by and by, have to make their appearance before the
   judgment-seat of God, where the question would not be, What were their
   titles? or, What was the splendour of their actions? but how it stood
   as to the purity of their hearts.

   10. My shield It is not wonderful that David often mingles meditations
   with his prayers, thereby to inspire himself with true confidence. We
   may go to God in prayer with great alacrity; but our fervour, if it
   does not gather new strength, either immediately fails or begins to
   languish. David, therefore, in order to continue in prayer with the
   same ardour of devotion and affection with which he commenced, brings
   to his recollection some of the most common truths of religion, and by
   this means fosters and invigorates his faith. He declares, that as God
   saves the upright in heart, he is perfectly safe under his protection.
   Whence it follows, that he had the testimony of an approving
   conscience. And, as he does not simply say the righteous, but the
   upright in heart, he appears to have an eye to that inward searching of
   the heart and reins mentioned in the preceding verse.

   11 God judgeth the righteous etc. Others read, God is a righteous
   Judge, and God is angry every day. The words will certainly admit of
   this sense; but as the doctrine is fuller according to the first
   reading, I have preferred following it, as I see it is more approved of
   by the most learned divines, and, besides, it is more suitable to the
   subject which David is now considering. As Saul and his accomplices
   had, by their calumnious reports, so far succeeded in their wicked
   design as to have produced a general prejudice against David, so that
   he was condemned by almost the whole people, the holy man supports
   himself from this one consideration, that whatever may be the confusion
   of things in the world, God, notwithstanding, can easily discern
   between the righteous and the wicked. He, therefore, appeals from the
   false judgments of men to Him who can never be deceived. It may,
   however, be asked, How does the Psalmist represent God as judging every
   day, when we see him delaying punishment frequently for a long time?
   The sacred writings certainly most justly celebrate his long-suffering;
   but, although he exercises patience long, and does not immediately
   execute his judgments, yet, as no time passes, yea, not even a day, in
   which he does not furnish the clearest evidence that he discerns
   between the righteous and the wicked, notwithstanding the confusion of
   things in the world, it is certain that he never ceases to execute the
   office of a judge. All who will be at the trouble to open their eyes to
   behold the government of the world, will distinctly see that the
   patience of God is very different from approbation or connivance.
   Surely, then, his own people will confidently betake themselves to him
   every day.

   Psalm 7:12-14

   12. If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow and
   made it ready. [111] 13. And he hath prepared for [112] the instruments
   of death; he shall make fit his arrows for them that persecute. [113]
   14. Behold, he shall travail to bring forth iniquity; he hath conceived
   wickedness, and he shall bring forth falsehood. [114]


   12 If he turn not These verses are usually explained in two ways. The
   meaning is, that if David's enemies should persevere in their malicious
   designs against him, there is denounced against them the vengeance
   which their obstinate wickedness deserves. Accordingly, in the second
   clause, they supply the name of God,--If he turn not, GOD will whet his
   sword; [115] as if it had been said, If my enemy do not repent, [116]
   he shall, at length, feel that God is completely armed for the purpose
   of maintaining and defending the righteous. If it is understood in this
   sense, the third verse is to be considered as a statement of the cause
   why God will thus equip himself with armour, namely, because the
   ungodly, in conceiving all kinds of mischief, in travailing to bring
   forth wickedness, and in at length bringing forth deceit and falsehood,
   directly assail God, and openly make war upon him. But, in my judgment,
   those who read these two verses in one continued sentence, give a more
   accurate interpretation. I am not, however, satisfied that even they
   fully bring out the meaning of the Psalmist. David, I have no doubt, by
   relating the dreadful attempts of his enemies against him, intended
   thereby to illustrate more highly the grace of God; for when these
   malicious men, strengthened by powerful military forces, and abundantly
   provided with armour, furiously rushed upon him in the full expectation
   of destroying him, who would not have said that it was all over with
   him? Moreover, there is implied in the words a kind of irony, when he
   pretends to be afraid of their putting him to death. They mean the same
   thing as if he had said, "If my enemy do not alter his purpose, or turn
   his fury and his strength in another direction, who can preserve me
   from perishing by his hands? He has an abundant supply of arms, and he
   is endeavouring, by all methods, to accomplish my death." But Saul is
   the person of whom he particularly speaks, and therefore he says, he
   hath made fit his arrows for the persecutors This implies that Saul had
   many agents in readiness who would willingly put forth their utmost
   efforts in seeking to destroy David. The design of the prophet,
   therefore, was to magnify the greatness of the grace of God, by showing
   the greatness of the danger from which he had been delivered by him.
   [117] Moreover, when it is here said, if he do not return, returning
   does not signify repentance and amendment in David's enemy, but only a
   change of will and purpose, as if he had said, "It is in the power of
   my enemy to do whatever his fancy may suggest." [118] Whence it appears
   the more clearly, how wonderful the change was which suddenly followed
   contrary all expectation. When he says that Saul had prepared the
   instruments of death for his bow, he intimates that he was driving
   after no ordinary thing, but was fully determined to wound to death the
   man whom he shot at. Some, referring the Hebrew word dvlqym doulekim,
   which we have rendered persecutors, to arrows, have rendered it
   burning, [119] because it has also this signification; [120] but the
   translation which I have given is the more appropriate. David complains
   that he had reason to be afraid, not only of one man, but of a great
   multitude, inasmuch as Saul had armed a powerful body of men to pursue
   and persecute a poor fugitive.

   14 Behold, he shall travail David has hitherto shown how great and
   formidable the danger was which was near him. In this verse, laughing
   to scorn the presumptuous and foolish attempts of Saul, and his
   magnificent preparations, he declares that they had failed of
   accomplishing their object. [121] By the demonstrative adverb Behold,
   he enhances the wonder, inasmuch as such a result fell out, on his part
   altogether unlooked for. Behold, says he, after he has travailed to
   bring forth wickedness, like as he had conceived mischief, at length
   there comes forth only empty wind and vanity, because God frustrated
   his expectations, and destroyed all these wicked attempts. [122]
   Iniquity and mischief are here put for every kind of violence and
   outrage [123] which Saul intended to inflict upon David. Some
   interpreters think that the order of the words is inverted, because
   travailing to bring forth is put before conceiving; but I think that
   the words have their proper place if you explain them thus: Behold, he
   shall travail to bring forth wickedness, for he hath conceived
   mischief; that is to say, as he long ago devised with himself my
   destruction, so he will do his utmost to put his design into execution.
   David afterwards adds, he hath brought forth falsehood This implies
   that Saul had been disappointed in his expectation; as Isaiah, (Isaiah
   26:18,) in like manner, speaks of unbelievers "bringing forth wind,"
   when their success does not correspond to their wicked and presumptuous
   attempts. As often, therefore, as we see the ungodly secretly plotting
   our ruin, let us remember that they speak falsehood to themselves; in
   other words deceive themselves, and shall fail in accomplishing what
   they devise in their hearts. [124] If, however, we do not perceive that
   they are disappointed in their designs until they are about to be
   brought forth, let us not be cast down, but bear it with a spirit of
   patient submission to the will and providence of God.

   [111] "Il a ja tendu son arc, et l'a dresse ascavoir pour tirer."--Fr.
   "He hath already bent his bow and made it ready, namely, to shoot." The
   words in italics are supplementary, there being nothing for them in the
   Hebrew text. Calvin, in his French version, has uniformly distinguished
   supplementary words by printing them in smaller characters.

   [112] According to Calvin, the pronoun refers to bow. Fry renders it
   differently. "It is," says he, "literally for himself--for his use. We
   must keep in view the metaphor of the warrior preparing for action."

   [113] "Pour les bailler aux persecuteurs."--Fr. "To give them to the
   persecutors."

   [114] "Car il a conceu meschancete, ou moleste, mais il enfantera
   mensonge." -- Fr. "For he hath conceived wickedness, or mischief, but
   he shall bring forth falsehoods."

   [115] This is the view adopted by Hengstenberg in his excellent
   Commentary on The Psalms. "The apparently coarse manner of expression
   in our text," says he, "representing God as a warrior equipped with
   sword and bow, has besides for its foundation the coarseness of
   sinners, and the weakness of faith on the part of believers, which does
   not direct itself against the visible danger with pure thoughts of
   God's controllable agency, but seeks to clothe those thoughts with
   flesh and blood, and regards the judge as standing over against the
   sinner, man against man, sword against sword."

   [116] "Ne cesse de me poursuyvre." -- Fr. "Do not cease from pursuing
   me."

   [117] "Duquel il avoit este delivre par luy." -- Fr.

   [118] "Au reste, quand il est yci parle de se retourner, ce n'est pas
   pour signifier ce que nous appelons repentance et amendement en son
   ennemi, mais tant seulement une volonte et deliberation diverse; comme
   si'il dit qu'il estoit en la puissance de l'ennemi de parfaire tout ce
   qui luy venoit en la fantasie." -- Fr.

   [119] Those who adopt this rendering, support it from the reading of
   the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac versions, although the Chaldee
   version reads persecuting; and they generally view the 12th and 13th
   verses as a representation of God under the image of a warrior ready to
   shoot his flaming, burning, fiery arrows, against the object to which
   he is opposed." I read vtslqym urentes, inflammatos; the arrows of the
   Almighty, (Deuteronomy 32:24.) Languishments of famine, the burnings of
   the carbuncle, and the bitter pestilence. Schultens, (Proverbs 26:23.)
   Lightnings are also called God's arrows, (Psalm 18:15,) and represented
   as the artillery of heaven."--Dr Kennicott's note on this place in his
   Select Passages of the Old Testament. Hengstenberg takes the same view.
   His rendering is, He [that is, God] makes his arrows burning. "rlq, to
   burn. In sieges it is customary to wrap round the arrows burning
   matter, and to shoot them after being kindled."

   Psalm 7:15-16

   15. He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it out; [125] and he hath fallen
   into the ditch which he hath made. 16. His wickedness shall return upon
   his own head, and his violence shall descend upon his own crown.


   Here David says not only that their wicked devices were without
   success, but that, by the wonderful providence of God, the result was
   the very opposite of what had been contemplated. He sets this forth in
   the first place metaphorically, by employing the figure of a pit and a
   ditch; and then he expresses the same thing in simple terms without
   figure, declaring, that the mischief intended for others returned upon
   the head of him who had devised it There is no doubt that it was a
   common proverb among the Jews, He who hath digged a pit falleth into
   it; which they quoted when they meant to say, that wicked and crafty
   men are caught in the snares and traps which they have set for others,
   or that the contrivers of the ruin of others perish by their own
   devices. [126] There is a twofold use of this doctrine: the first
   place, however skilled in craft our enemies may be, and whatever means
   of doing mischief they may have, we must nevertheless look for the
   issue which God here promises, that they shall fall by their own sword.
   And this is not a thing which happens by chance; but God, by the secret
   direction of his own hand, causes the evil which they intend to bring
   upon the innocent to return upon their own heads. In the second place,
   If at any time we are instigated by passion to inflict any injury upon
   our neighbours, or to commit any wickedness, let us remember this
   principle of retributive justice, which is often acted upon by the
   divine government, that those who prepare a pit for others are cast
   into it themselves; and the effect will be, that every one, in
   proportion as he would consult his own happiness and welfare, will be
   careful to restrain himself from doing any injury, even the smallest,
   to another.

   17 I will praise Jehovah according to his righteousness; and I will
   sing to the name of Jehovah, Most High As the design of God in the
   deliverances which he vouchsafes to his servants is, that they may
   render to him in return the sacrifices of praise, David here promises
   that he will gratefully acknowledge the deliverance which he had
   received, and at the same time affirms that his preservation from death
   was the undoubted and manifest work of God. He could not, with truth,
   and from the heart, have ascribed to God the praise of his deliverance,
   if he had not been fully persuaded that he had been preserved otherwise
   than by the power of man. He, therefore, not only promises to exercise
   the gratitude which was due to his deliverer, but he confirms in one
   word what he has rehearsed throughout the psalm, that he is indebted
   for his life to the grace of God, who had not suffered Saul to take it
   from him. The righteousness of God is here to be understood of his
   faithfulness which he makes good to his servants in defending and
   preserving their lives. God does not shut up or conceal his
   righteousness from our view in the secret recesses of his own mind, but
   manifests it for our advantage when he defends us against all wrongful
   violence, delivers us from oppression, and preserves us in safety
   although wicked men make war upon us and persecute us.

   [125] Fry, from a comparison of the Hebrew word which Calvin renders
   hollowed it out, with the cognate Arabic words supposes that it means
   "dug it over, so as to cover and hide it." The imagery is taken from
   the common method of catching lions and other wild beasts in the east,
   by digging pits on the spots which they were observed to frequent, and
   covering them slightly over with reeds or small branches of trees.
   Luther's translation of this clause is precisely the same with that of
   Calvin; and, in his Commentary on the place, he well explains the force
   of the expressions of the Psalmist. "See," says he, "how admirably he
   expresses the hot burning fury of the ungodly, not simply declaring, he
   has dug a pit, but adding to this, and hollowed it out. So active and
   diligent are they to have the pit dug and the hole prepared. They try
   every thing, they explore every thing, and not satisfied that they have
   dug a pit, they clear it out and make it deep, as deep as they possibly
   can, that they may destroy and subvert the innocent."

   PSALM 8.

   David, reflecting upon God's fatherly beneficence towards mankind, is
   not content with simply giving thanks for it, but is enraptured by the
   contemplation of it.

   To the chief musician upon Hagittith. A song of David.

   Psalm 8:1

   1. O Jehovah, our Lord! [127] How wonderful is thy name in all the
   earth, to set [128] thy glory above the heavens!


   Whether gtyt, Gittith, signifies a musical instrument or some
   particular tune, or the beginning of some famous and well-known song, I
   do not take upon me to determine. Those who think that the psalm is so
   called because it was composed in the city of Gath, give a strained and
   far-fetched explanation of the matter. Of the other three opinions, of
   which I have spoken, it is not of much importance which is adopted. The
   principal thing to be attended to is what the psalm itself contains,
   and what is the design of it. David, it is true, sets before his eyes
   the wonderful power and glory of God in the creation and government of
   the material universe; but he only slightly glances at this subject, as
   it were, in passing, and insists principally on the theme of God's
   infinite goodness towards us. There is presented to us in the whole
   order of nature, the most abundant matter for showing forth the glory
   of God, but, as we are unquestionably more powerfully affected with
   what we ourselves experience, David here, with great propriety,
   expressly celebrates the special favor which God manifests towards
   mankind; for this, of all the subjects which come under our
   contemplation, is the brightest mirror in which we can behold his
   glory. It is, however, strange why he begins the psalm with an
   exclamation, when the usual way is first to give an account of a thing,
   and then to magnify its greatness and excellence. But if we remember
   what is said in other passages of Scripture, respecting the
   impossibility of expressing in words the works of God, we will not be
   surprised that David, by this exclamation, acknowledges himself unequal
   to the task of recounting them. David, therefore, when reflecting on
   the incomprehensible goodness which God has been graciously pleased to
   bestow on the human race, and feeling all his thoughts and senses
   swallowed up, and overwhelmed in the contemplation, exclaims that it is
   a subject worthy of admiration, because it cannot be set forth in
   words. [129] Besides, the Holy Spirit, who directed David's tongue,
   doubtless intended, by his instrumentality, to awaken men from the
   torpor and indifference which is common to them, so that they may not
   content themselves with celebrating the infinite love of God and the
   innumerable benefits which they receive at his hand, in their sparing
   and frigid manner, but may rather apply their whole hearts to this holy
   exercise, and put forth in it their highest efforts. This exclamation
   of David implies, that when all the faculties of the human mind are
   exerted to the utmost in meditation on this subject, [130] they yet
   come far short of it.

   The name of God, as I explain it, is here to be understood of the
   knowledge of the character and perfections of God, in so far as he
   makes himself known to us. I do not approve of the subtle speculations
   of those who think the name of God means nothing else but God himself.
   It ought rather to be referred to the works and properties by which he
   is known, than to his essence. David, therefore, says that the earth is
   full of the wonderful glory of God, so that the fame or renown thereof
   not only reaches to the heavens, but ascends far above them. The verb
   tnh, tenah, has been rendered by some in the preterite tense, hast set,
   but in my judgment, those give a more accurate translation who render
   it in the infinitive mood, to place or to set; because the second
   clause is just an amplification of the subject of the first; as if he
   had said, the earth is too small to contain the glory or the wonderful
   manifestations of the character and perfections of God. According to
   this view, 'sr, asher, will not be a relative, but will have the
   meaning of the expletive or exegetic particle even, which we use to
   explain what has preceded. [131]

   Psalm 8:2

   2. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast founded thy
   strength, because of thy adversaries, that thou mightest put to flight
   the enemy and avenger.


   He now enters upon the proof of the subject which he had undertaken to
   discourse upon, [132] declaring, that the providence of God, in order
   to make itself known to mankind, does not wait till men arrive at the
   age of maturity, but even from the very dawn of infancy shines forth so
   brightly as is sufficient to confute all the ungodly, who, through
   their profane contempt of God, would wish to extinguish his very name.
   [133]

   The opinion of some, who think that mphy, mephi, out of the mouth,
   signifies kphy, kephi, in the mouth, cannot be admitted, because it
   improperly weakens the emphasis which David meant to give to his
   language and discourse. The meaning, therefore, is, that God, in order
   to commend his providence, has no need of the powerful eloquence of
   rhetoricians, [134] nor even of distinct and formed language, because
   the tongues of infants, although they do not as yet speak, are ready
   and eloquent enough to celebrate it. But it may be asked, In what sense
   does he speak of children as the proclaimers of the glory of God? In my
   judgment, those reason very foolishly who think that this is done when
   children begin to articulate, because then also the intellectual
   faculty of the soul shows itself. Granting that they are called babes,
   or infants, even until they arrive at their seventh year, how can such
   persons imagine that those who now speak distinctly are still hanging
   on the breast? Nor is there any more propriety in the opinion of those
   who say, that the words for babes and sucklings are here put
   allegorically for the faithful, who, being born again by the Spirit of
   God, no longer retain the old age of the flesh. What need, then, is
   there to wrest the words of David, when their true meaning is so clear
   and suitable? He says that babes and sucklings are advocates
   sufficiently powerful to vindicate the providence of God. Why does he
   not entrust this business to men, but to show that the tongues of
   infants, even before they are able to pronounce a single word, speak
   loudly and distinctly in commendation of God's liberality towards the
   human race? Whence is it that nourishment is ready for them as soon as
   they are born, but because God wonderfully changes blood into milk?
   Whence, also, have they the skill to suck, but because the same God
   has, by a mysterious instinct, fitted their tongues for doing this?
   David, therefore, has the best reason for declaring, that although the
   tongues of all, who have arrived at the age of manhood, should become
   silent, the speechless mouth of infants is sufficiently able to
   celebrate the praise of God. And when he not only introduces babes as
   witnesses and preachers of God's glory, but also attributes mature
   strength to their mouth, the expression is very emphatic. It means the
   same thing as if he had said, These are invincible champions of God
   who, when it comes to the conflict, can easily scatter and discomfit
   the whole host of the wicked despisers of God, and those who have
   abandoned themselves to impiety. [135] We should observe against whom
   he imposes upon infants the office of defending the glory of God,
   namely, against the hardened despisers of God, who dare to rise up
   against heaven to make war upon God, as the poets have said, in olden
   time, of the giants. [136]

   Since, therefore, these monsters, [137] with furious violence, pluck up
   by the roots, and overthrow whatever godliness and the fear of God
   [138] there is in the world, and through their hardihood endeavor to do
   violence to heaven itself, David in mockery of them brings into the
   field of battle against them the mouths of infants, which he says are
   furnished with armor of sufficient strength, and endued with sufficient
   fortitude, to lay their intolerable pride [139] in the dust. He,
   therefore, immediately subjoins, On account of the adversaries God is
   not under the necessity of making war with great power to overcome the
   faithful, who willingly hearken to his voice, and manifest a ready
   obedience, as soon as he gives the smallest intimation of his will. The
   providence of God, I confess, shines forth principally for the sake of
   the faithful, because they only have eyes to behold it. But as they
   show themselves willing to receive instruction, God teaches them with
   gentleness; while, on the other hand, he arms himself against his
   enemies, who never submit themselves to him but by constraint. Some
   take the word founded as meaning, that, in the very birth or generation
   of man, God lays foundations for manifesting his own glory. But this
   sense is too restricted. I have no doubt that the word is put for to
   establish, as if the prophet had said, God needs not strong military
   forces to destroy the ungodly; instead of these, the mouths of children
   are sufficient for his purpose. [140]

   To put to flight. Interpreters differ with respect to the word hsvyt,
   hashebith. It properly signifies, to cause to cease; for it is in the
   conjugation Hiphil of the neuter verb svt, shabath, which signifies to
   cease. But it is often taken metaphorically for to destroy, or to
   reduce to nothing, because destruction or death brings to an end.
   Others translate it, that thou mayest restrain, as if David meant that
   they were put to silence, so that they desisted from cursing or
   reviling God. As, however, there is here a beautiful allusion to a
   hostile combat, as I have a little before explained, I have preferred
   the military phrase, to put to flight. But it is asked, How does God
   put to flight his enemies, who, by their impious slanders and
   detractions, do not cease to strike at, and violently to rush forward
   to oppose all the proofs of a Divine Providence which daily manifest
   themselves? [141] I answer, They are not routed or overthrown in
   respect of their being compelled to become more humble and unassuming;
   but because, with all their blasphemies and canine barkings, they
   continue in the state of abasement and confusion to which they have
   been brought. To express the whole in a few words: so early as the
   generation or birth of man the splendor of Divine Providence is so
   apparent, that even infants, who hang upon their mothers' breasts, can
   bring down to the ground the fury of the enemies of God. Although his
   enemies may do their utmost, and may even burst with rage a hundred
   times, it is in vain for them to endeavor to overthrow the strength
   which manifests itself in the weakness of infancy. A desire of revenge
   reigns in all unbelievers, while, on the other hand, God governs his
   own children by the spirit of meekness and benignity: [142] but,
   according to the scope of the present passage, the prophet applies this
   epithet, the avenger, to the despisers of God, who are not only cruel
   towards man, but who also burn with frantic rage to make war even
   against God himself.

   I have now discharged the duty of a faithful interpreter in opening up
   the mind of the prophet. There is only one difficulty remaining, which
   is this, that Christ (Matthew 21:16) seems to put upon this passage a
   different meaning, when he applies it to children ten years old. But
   this difficulty is easily removed. Christ reasons from the greater to
   the less in this manner; If God has appointed children even in infancy
   the vindicators of his glory, there is no absurdity in his making them
   the instruments of showing forth his praise by their tongues after they
   have arrived at the age of seven years and upwards.

   Psalm 8:3-4

   3. When I see thy heavens, the works of thy fingers; the moon and the
   stars which thou hast arranged: 4. What is man [143] that thou art
   mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? [144]


   As the Hebrew particle ky, ki, has often the same meaning as because or
   for, and simply affirms a thing, both the Greek and the Latin fathers
   have generally read the fourth verse as if it were a complete sentence
   by itself. But it is, doubtless, closely connected with the following
   verse; and, therefore, the two verses ought to be joined together. The
   Hebrew word ky, ki, might be very properly translated into the
   disjunctive particle, although, making the meaning to be this: Although
   the infinite majesty of God shines forth in the heavenly bodies, and
   justly keeps the eyes of men fixed on the contemplation of it, yet his
   glory is beheld in a special manner, in the great favor which he bears
   to men, and in the goodness which he manifests towards them. This
   interpretation would not be at variance with the scope of the passage;
   but I choose rather to follow the generally received opinion. My
   readers, however, must be careful to mark the design of the Psalmist,
   which is to enhance, by this comparison, the infinite goodness of God;
   for it is, indeed, a wonderful thing that the Creator of heaven, whose
   glory is so surpassingly great as to ravish us with the highest
   admiration, condescends so far as graciously to take upon him the care
   of the human race. That the Psalmist makes this contrast may be
   inferred from the Hebrew word, 'nvs, enosh, which we have rendered man,
   and which expresses the frailty of man rather than any strength or
   power which he possesses. [145] We see that miserable men, in moving
   upon the earth, are mingled with the vilest creatures; and, therefore,
   God, with very good reason, might despise them and reckon them of no
   account if he were to stand upon the consideration of his own greatness
   or dignity. The prophet, therefore, speaking interrogatively, abases
   their condition, intimating that God's wonderful goodness is displayed
   the more brightly in that so glorious a Creator, whose majesty shines
   resplendently in the heavens, graciously condescends to adorn a
   creature so miserable and vile as man is with the greatest glory, and
   to enrich him with numberless blessings. If he had a mind to exercise
   his liberality towards any, he was under no necessity of choosing men
   who are but dust and clay, in order to prefer them above all other
   creatures, seeing he had a sufficient number in heaven towards whom to
   show himself liberal. [146] Whoever, therefore, is not astonished and
   deeply affected at this miracle, is more than ungrateful and stupid.
   When the Psalmist calls the heavens God's heavens, and the works of his
   fingers, he has a reference to the same subject, and intends to
   illustrate it. How is it that God comes forth from so noble and
   glorious a part of his works, and stoops down to us, poor worms of the
   earth, if it is not to magnify and to give a more illustrious
   manifestation of his goodness? From this, also, we learn, that those
   are chargeable with a very presumptuous abuse of the goodness of God,
   who take occasion from it to be proud of the excellence which they
   possess, as if they had either obtained it by their own skill, or as if
   they possessed it on account of their own merit; whereas their origin
   should rather remind them that it has been gratuitously conferred upon
   those who are otherwise vile and contemptible creatures, and utterly
   unworthy of receiving any good from God. Whatever estimable quality,
   therefore, we see in ourselves, let it stir us up to celebrate the free
   and undeserved goodness of God in bestowing it upon us.

   The verb, at the close of the third verse, which others translate to
   prepare, or to found, or to establish, I have thought proper to render
   to arrange; for the Psalmist seems to have a reference to the very
   beautiful order by which God has so appropriately distinguished the
   position of the stars, and daily regulates their course. When it is
   said, God is mindful of man, it signifies the same thing as that he
   bears towards him a fatherly love, defends and cherishes him, and
   extends his providence towards him. Almost all interpreters render
   phqd, pakad, the last word of this verse, to visit; and I am unwilling
   to differ from them, since this sense suits the passage very well. But
   as it sometimes signifies to remember, and as we will often find in the
   Psalms the repetition of the same thought in different words, it may
   here be very properly translated to remember; as if David had said,
   This is a marvellous thing, that God thinks upon men, and remembers
   them continually.

   [144] "Ou, as sourchance de luy?" -- Fr. marg. "Or, art mindful of

   [145] The other phrase by which man is described, vn 'dm, ben Adam, is
   literally the son of Adam, -- man, the son of Adam, and who, like him,
   is formed of the dust of the ground, as the name Adam implies, man, the
   son of apostate and fallen Adam, and who is depraved and guilty like
   him. As before, men are called Enosh for their doleful estate by sin,
   so are they called Adam and sons of Adam, that is, earthly, to put them

   Even the [noblest] son of man, that thou visitest him?" And adds, in a

   Psalm 8:5-6

   5. For [147] thou hast made him little lower than God. [148] and hast
   crowned him with glory and honor. 6. Thou hast set him over the works
   of thy hands: Thou hast put all things under his feet.


   5. Thou hast made him little lower. The Hebrew copulative ky, ki, I
   have no doubt, ought to be translated into the causal particle for,
   seeing the Psalmist confirms what he has just now said concerning the
   infinite goodness of God towards men, in showing himself near to them,
   and mindful of them. In the first place, he represents them as adorned
   with so many honors as to render their condition not far inferior to
   divine and celestial glory. In the second place, he mentions the
   external dominion and power which they possess over all creatures, from
   which it appears how high the degree of dignity is to which God hath
   exalted them. I have, indeed, no doubt but he intends, by the first,
   [149] the distinguished endowments which clearly manifest that men were
   formed after the image of God, and created to the hope of a blessed and
   immortal life. The reason with which they are endued, and by which they
   can distinguish between good and evil; the principle of religion which
   is planted in them; their intercourse with each other, which is
   preserved from being broken up by certain sacred bonds; the regard to
   what is becoming, and the sense of shame which guilt awakens in them,
   as well as their continuing to be governed by laws; all these things
   are clear indications of pre-eminent and celestial wisdom. David,
   therefore, not without good reason, exclaims that mankind are adorned
   with glory and honor. To be crowned, is here taken metaphorically, as
   if David had said, he is clothed and adorned with marks of honor, which
   are not far removed from the splendor of the divine majesty. The
   Septuagint render 'lhym, Elohim, by angels, of which I do not
   disapprove, since this name, as is well known, is often given to
   angels, and I explain the words of David as meaning the same thing as
   if he had said, that the condition of men is nothing less than a divine
   and celestial state. But as the other translation seems more natural,
   and as it is almost universally adopted by the Jewish interpreters, I
   have preferred following it. Nor is it any sufficient objection to this
   view, that the apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, (Hebrews 2:7)
   quoting this passage, says, little less than the angels, and not than
   God; [150] for we know what freedoms the apostles took in quoting texts
   of Scripture; not, indeed, to wrest them to a meaning different from
   the true one but because they reckoned it sufficient to show, by a
   reference to Scripture, that what they taught was sanctioned by the
   word of God, although they did not quote the precise words.
   Accordingly, they never had any hesitation in changing the words,
   provided the substance of the text remained unchanged.

   There is another question which it is more difficult to solve. While
   the Psalmist here discourses concerning the excellency of men, and
   describes them, in respect of this, as coming near to God, the apostle
   applies the passage to the humiliation of Christ. In the first place,
   we must consider the propriety of applying to the person of Christ what
   is here spoken concerning all mankind; and, secondly, how we may
   explain it as referring to Christ's being humbled in his death, when he
   lay without form or beauty, and as it were disfigured under the
   reproach and curse of the cross. What some say, that what is true of
   the members may be properly and suitably transferred to the head, might
   be a sufficient answer to the first question; but I go a step farther,
   for Christ is not only the first begotten of every creature, but also
   the restorer of mankind. What David here relates belongs properly to
   the beginning of the creation, when man's nature was perfect. [151] But
   we know that, by the fall of Adam, all mankind fell from their primeval
   state of integrity, for by this the image of God was almost entirely
   effaced from us, and we were also divested of those distinguishing
   gifts by which we would have been, as it were, elevated to the
   condition of demigods; in short, from a state of the highest
   excellence, we were reduced to a condition of wretched and shameful
   destitution. In consequence of this corruption, the liberality of God,
   of which David here speaks, ceased, so far, at least, as that it does
   not at all appear in the brilliancy and splendor in which it was
   manifested when man was in his unfallen state. True, it is not
   altogether extinguished; but, alas! how small a portion of it remains
   amidst the miserable overthrow and ruins of the fall. But as the
   heavenly Father hath bestowed upon his Son an immeasurable fullness of
   all blessings, that all of us may draw from this fountain, it follows
   that whatever God bestows upon us by him belongs of fight to him in the
   highest degree; yea, he himself is the living image of God, according
   to which we must be renewed, upon which depends our participation of
   the invaluable blessings which are here spoken of. If any person object
   that David first put the question, What is man? because God has so
   abundantly poured forth his favor upon a creature, so miserable,
   contemptible, and worthless; but that there is no cause for such
   admiration of God's favor for Christ, who is not an ordinary man, but
   the only begotten Son of God. The answer is easy, and it is this: What
   was bestowed upon Christ's human nature was a free gift; nay, more, the
   fact that a mortal man, and the son of Adam, is the only Son of God,
   and the Lord of glory, and the head of angels, affords a bright
   illustration of the mercy of God. At the same time, it is to be
   observed, that whatever gifts he has received ought to be considered as
   proceeding from the free grace of God, so much the more for this
   reason, that they are intended principally to be conferred upon us. His
   excellence and heavenly dignity, therefore, are extended to us also,
   seeing it is for our sake he is enriched with them.

   What the apostle therefore says in that passage concerning the
   abasement of Christ for a short time, is not intended by him as an
   explanation of this text; but for the purpose of enriching and
   illustrating the subject on which he is discoursing, he introduces and
   accommodates to it what had been spoken in a different sense. The same
   apostle did not hesitate, in Romans 10:6, in the same manner to enrich
   and to employ, in a sense different from their original one, the words
   of Moses in Deuteronomy 30:12:

   "Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us, that we may
   hear it and do it?"

   etc. The apostle, therefore, in quoting this psalm, had not so much an
   eye to what David meant; but making an allusion to these words, Thou
   hast made him a little lower; and again, Thou hast crowned him with
   honor, he applies this diminution to the death of Christ, and the glory
   and honor to his resurrection. [152] A similar account may be given of
   Paul's declaration in Ephesians 4:8, in which he does not so much
   explain the meaning of the text, (Psalm 68:18) as he devoutly applies
   it, by way of accommodation, to the person of Christ.

   6. Thou hast set him over. David now comes to the second point, which I
   have just now spoken of, namely, that from the dominion over all things
   which God has conferred upon men, it is evident how great is the love
   which he has borne towards them, and how much account he has made of
   them. As he does not stand in need of any thing himself, he has
   destined all the riches, both of heaven and earth, for their use. It is
   certainly a singular honor, and one which cannot be sufficiently
   estimated, that mortal man, as the representative of God, has dominion
   over the world, as if it pertained to him by right, and that to
   whatever quarter he turns his eyes, he sees nothing wanting which may
   contribute to the convenience and happiness of his life. As this
   passage is quoted by Paul in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, (1
   Corinthians 15:27) where he discourses concerning the spiritual kingdom
   of Christ, some may object and say, that the meaning he puts upon it is
   very different from the sense which I have given. But it is easy to
   answer this objection, and the answer which I give to it is this, That
   generally the whole order of this world is arranged and established for
   the purpose of conducing to the comfort and happiness of men. In what
   way the passage may properly apply to Christ alone, I have already
   declared a little before. The only thing which now remains to be
   considered is, how far this declaration extends -- that all things are
   subjected to men. Now, there is no doubt, that if there is any thing in
   heaven or on earth which is opposed to men, the beautiful order which
   God had established in the world at the beginning is now thrown into
   confusion. The consequence of this is, that mankind, after they were
   ruined by the fall of Adam, were not only deprived of so distinguished
   and honorable an estate, and dispossessed of their former dominion, but
   are also held captive under a degrading and ignominious bondage.
   Christ, it is true, is the lawful heir of heaven and earth, by whom the
   faithful recover what they had lost in Adam; but he has not as yet
   actually entered upon the full possession of his empire and dominion.
   Whence the apostle concludes, that what is here said by David [153]
   will not be perfectly accomplished until death be abolished.
   Accordingly, the apostle reasons in this manner, "If all things are
   subdued to Christ, nothing ought to stand in opposition to his people.
   But we see death still exercising his tyranny against them. It follows
   then, that there remains the hope of a better state than the present."
   Now, this flows from the principle of which I have spoken, that the
   world was originally created for this end, that every part of it should
   tend to the happiness of man as its great object. In another part of
   his writings, the apostle argues on the same principle, when, in order
   to prove that we must all stand at the last day before the
   judgment-seat of Christ, he brings forward the following passage, Unto
   me every knee shall bow," (Romans 14:10.) In this syllogism, what
   Logicians call the minor proposition must be supplied, [154] namely,
   that there are still too many who proudly and obstinately cast off his
   yoke, and are averse to bow the knee in token of their submission to
   him.

   [150] Certainly the fact that Paul uses the word angels instead of God,

   version was in general use among the Jews in the time of Paul, he very
   naturally quotes from it just as we do from our English version. And
   this was sufficient for his purpose. His object was, to answer an
   objection which the Jews brought against the Christian dispensation, as
   being inferior to the Mosaic, inasmuch as angels were mediators of the
   latter, while the mediator or head of the former was in their
   estimation but a man. This objection he answers from their own
   Scriptures, and quotes this psalm to show, that Christ, in his human
   nature, was little inferior to the angels, and that he is exalted far
   above them in respect of the glory and dominion with which he is
   crowned. If the apostle had quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures, and used
   'lhym, Elohim, God, meaning the Most High, his argument in support of
   the dignity of Christ in human nature would have been still stronger. -

   Psalm 8:7-9

   7. All sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the fields; 8. The birds
   of the air, and, the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through
   the paths of the seas. 9. O Jehovah, our Lord, how wonderful is thy
   name in all the earth!


   The preceding question, with respect to the extent of man's dominion
   over the works of God, seems not yet to be fully answered. If the
   prophet here declares, by way of exposition, to what extent God has put
   all things in subjection to us, this subjection, it seems, must be
   restricted to what contributes to the temporal comfort and convenience
   of man while he continues in this world. To this difficulty I answer,
   That the Psalmist does not intend in these verses to give a complete
   enumeration of all the things which are subjected to man's dominion,
   and of which he had spoken generally in the preceding verse, but he
   brings forward an example of this subjection only in one part or
   particular; yea, he has especially chosen that part which affords a
   clear and manifest evidence of the truth he intended to establish, even
   to those whose minds are uncultivated and slow of apprehension. There
   is no man of a mind so dull and stupid but may se if he will be at the
   trouble to open his eyes, that it is by the wonderful providence of God
   that horses and oxen yield their service to men, -- that sheep produce
   wool to clothe them -- and that all sorts of animals supply them with
   food for their nourishment and support, even from their own flesh. And
   the more that this dominion is apparent, the more ought we to be
   affected with a sense of the goodness and grace of our God as often as
   we either eat food, or enjoy any of the other comforts of life. We are,
   therefore, not to understand David as meaning that it is a proof that
   man is invested with dominion over all the works of God, because he
   clothes himself with the wool and the skins of beasts, because he lives
   upon their flesh, and because he employs their labor for his own
   advantage; for this would be inconclusive reasoning. He only brings
   forward this as an example, and as a mirror in which we may behold and
   contemplate the dominion over the works of his hands, with which God
   has honored man. The sum is this: God, in creating man, gave a
   demonstration of his infinite grace and more than fatherly love towards
   him, which ought justly to strike us with amazement; and although, by
   the fall of man, that happy condition has been almost entirely ruined,
   yet there is still in him some remains of the liberality which God then
   displayed towards him, which should suffice to fill us with admiration.
   In this mournful and wretched overthrow, it is true, the legitimate
   order which God originally established no longer shines forth, but the
   faithful whom God gathers to himself, under Christ their head, enjoy so
   much of the fragments of the good things which they lost in Adam, as
   may furnish them with abundant matter of wonder at the singularly
   gracious manner in which God deals with them. David here confines his
   attention to God's temporal benefits, but it is our duty to rise
   higher, and to contemplate the invaluable treasures of the kingdom of
   heaven which he has unfolded in Christ, and all the gifts which belong
   to the spiritual life, that by reflecting upon these our hearts may be
   inflamed with love to God, that we may be stirred up to the practice of
   godliness, and that we may not suffer ourselves to become slothful and
   remiss in celebrating his praises.

   Psalm 9

   David, after having recounted the former victories which he had gained,
   and exalted in lofty strains the grace and power of God in their happy
   issue, now again, when he sees new enemies and dangers rising up,
   implores the protection of the same God by whom he had before been
   delivered, and beseeches him to overthrow the pride of his enemies.

   To the chief musician Almuth Laben. A Psalm of David.

   This inscription is variously explained. Some translate it, Upon the
   death of Laben, and are of opinion that he was one of the chief
   captains of David's enemies. Others are inclined to think it was rather
   a fictitious name, and that Goliath is the person spoken of in this
   psalm. According to others, it was a musical instrument. But to me it
   seems a more correct, or, at least, (as I am accustomed to speak when
   the matter is obscure, [155] a more probable opinion, that it was the
   beginning of some well-known song, to the tune of which the psalm was
   composed. The disputes of interpreters as to what victory David here
   celebrates, in my judgment, are unnecessary, and serve no good purpose.
   In the first place, their opinion that it is a song of victory, in
   which David simply gives thanks to God, is confuted, and shown to be
   erroneous from the scope of the psalm. The greater part is indeed
   occupied in singing the praises of God, but the whole ought to be
   considered as a prayer; in which, for the purpose of elevating his mind
   to confidence in God, he calls to his remembrance, according to his
   usual manner, by what wonderful displays of the power of God he had
   formerly been delivered from the violence and power of his enemies. It
   is therefore a mistake to limit to one victory this thanksgiving, in
   which he intended to comprehend many deliverances.

   Psalm 9:1-3

   1. I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart; I will tell of thy
   marvellous works. 2. I will rejoice and exult [156] in thee; yea, I
   will celebrate in songs thy name, O thou Most High. 3. When my enemies
   are turned back, they fall down, and are put to flight [157] at thy
   presence.


   1. I will praise the Lord. David begins the psalm in this way, to
   induce God to succor him in the calamities with which he was now
   afflicted. As God continues his favor towards his own people without
   intermission, all the good he has hitherto done to us should serve to
   inspire us with confidence and hope, that he will be gracious and
   merciful to us in the time to come. [158] There is, indeed, in these
   words a profession of gratitude for the favors which he has received
   from God; [159] but, in remembering his past mercies, he encourages
   himself to expect succor and aid in future emergencies; and by this
   means he opens the gate of prayer. The whole heart is taken for an
   upright or sincere heart, which is opposed to a double heart. Thus he
   distinguishes himself not only from gross hypocrites, who praise God
   only with their lips outwardly, without having their hearts in any way
   affected, but also acknowledges that whatever he had hitherto done
   which was commendable, proceeded entirely from the pure grace of God.
   Even irreligious men, I admit, when they have obtained some memorable
   victory, are ashamed to defraud God of the praise which is due to him;
   but we see that as soon as they have uttered a single expression in
   acknowledgement of the assistance God has afforded them, they
   immediately begin to boast loudly, and to sing triumphs in honor of
   their own valor, as if they were under no obligations whatever to God.
   In short, it is a piece of pure mockery when they profess that their
   exploits have been done by the help of God; for, after having made
   oblation to Him, they sacrifice to their own counsels, skill, courage,
   and resources. Observe how the prophet Habakkuk, under the person of
   one presumptuous king, wisely reproves the ambition which is common to
   all, (Habakkuk 1:16.) Yea, we see that the famous generals of
   antiquity, who, upon returning victorious from some battle, desired
   public and solemn thanksgivings [160] to be decreed in their name to
   the gods, thought of nothing less than of doing honor to their false
   deities; but only abused their names under a false pretense, in order
   thereby to obtain an opportunity of indulging in vain boasting, that
   their own superior prowess might be acknowledged. [161] David,
   therefore, with good reason, affirms that he is unlike the children of
   this world, whose hypocrisy or fraud is discovered by the wicked and
   dishonest distribution which they make between God and themselves,
   [162] arrogating to themselves the greater part of the praise which
   they pretended to ascribe to God. He praised God with his whole heart,
   which they did not; for certainly it is not praising God with the whole
   heart when a mortal man dares to appropriate the smallest portion of
   the glory which God claims for himself. God cannot bear with seeing his
   glory appropriated by the creature in even the smallest degree, so
   intolerable to him is the sacrilegious arrogance of those who by
   praising themselves, obscure his glory as far as they can.

   I will tell of all thy marvellous works. Here David confirms what I
   have already said, that he does not treat in this psalm of one victory
   or one deliverance only; for he proposes to himself in general all the
   miracles which God had wrought in his behalf, as subjects of
   meditation. He applies the term marvellous not to all the benefits
   which he had received from God, but to those more signal and memorable
   deliverances in which was exhibited a bright and striking manifestation
   of the divine power. God would have us to acknowledge him as the author
   of all our blessings; but on some of his gifts he has engraven more
   evident marks in order the more effectually to awaken our senses, which
   are otherwise as if asleep or dead. David's language, therefore, is an
   acknowledgement that he was preserved of God, not by ordinary means,
   but by the special power of God, which was conspicuously displayed in
   this matter; inasmuch as he had stretched forth his hand in a
   miraculous manner, and above the common and usual way.

   2. I will rejoice and exult in thee. Observe how the faithful praise
   God sincerely and without hypocrisy, when they do not rest on
   themselves for happiness, and are not intoxicated with foolish and
   carnal presumption, but rejoice in God alone; which is nothing else
   than to seek the matter of their joy from the favor of God, and from no
   other source, since in it perfect happiness consists. I will rejoice in
   thee We ought to consider how great is the difference and opposition
   between the character of the joy which men endeavor to find in
   themselves, and the character of the joy which they seek in God. David,
   the more forcibly to express how he renounces every thing which may
   keep hold of or occupy him with vain delight, adds the word exult, by
   which he means that he finds in God a full and an overflowing abundance
   of joy, so that he is not under the necessity of seeking even the
   smallest drop in any other quarter. Moreover, it is of importance to
   remember what I have previously observed, that David sets before
   himself the testimonies of the divine goodness which he had formerly
   experienced, in order to encourage himself with the more alacrity to
   lay open his heart [163] to God, and to present his prayers before him.
   He who begins his prayer by affirming that God is the great source and
   object of his joy, fortifies himself before-hand with the strongest
   confidence, in presenting his supplications to the hearer of prayer.

   3. While my enemies are turned back. In these words he assigns the
   reason why he undertakes to sing the praises of God, namely, because he
   acknowledges that his frequent victories had been achieved, not by his
   own power, nor by the power of his soldiers, but by the free favor of
   God. In the first part of the verse he narrates historically how his
   enemies were discomfited or put to flight; and then he adds, what faith
   alone could enable him to say, that this did not take place by the
   power of man or by chance, but because God fought for him, [164] and
   stood against them in the battle. He says, they fall, [165] and are put
   to flight At Thy Presence. David therefore acted wisely, when, upon
   seeing his enemies turn their backs, he lifted up the eyes of his mind
   to God, in order to perceive that victory flowed to him from no other
   source than from the secret and incomprehensible aid of God. And,
   doubtless, it is He only who guides the simple by the spirit of wisdom,
   while he inflicts madness on the crafty, and strikes them with
   amazement, -- who inspires with courage the faint and timid, while he
   causes the boldest to tremble with fear, -- who restores to the feeble
   their strength, while he reduces the strong to weakness, -- who upholds
   the fainthearted by his power, while he makes the sword to fall from
   the hands of the valiant; - and, finally, who brings the battle to a
   prosperous or disastrous issue, just as he pleases. When, therefore, we
   see our enemies overthrown, we must beware of limiting our view to what
   is visible to the eye of sense, like ungodly men, who, while they see
   with their bodily eyes, are yet blind; but let us instantly call to our
   remembrance this truth, that when our enemies turn back, they are put
   to flight by the presence of the Lord. [166] The verbs, fall and put to
   flight, in the Hebrew, are in the future tense, but I have translated
   them in the present, because David anew presents to his own view the
   goodness of God which had formerly been manifested towards him.

   used for stumbled. The idea there is not properly that of falling, but
   of being wounded and weakened by the stumbling-blocks in the way,
   previous to falling. The word ksl, cashal, has been viewed as having
   the same meaning in the passage before us. "It refers," says Hammond,
   "to those that either faint in a march or are wounded in a battle, or
   especially that in flight meet with galling traps in their way, and so
   are galled and lamed, rendered unable to go forward, and so fall, and

   overtaken and perish in the fall."

   Psalm 9:4-5

   4. For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou sittest upon
   the throne a righteous judge. [167] 5. Thou hast rebuked the nations;
   thou hast destroyed the wicked; thou hast blotted out their name for
   ever and ever.


   The Psalmist proceeds a step farther in the 4th verse, declaring that
   God stretched forth his hand to give him succor, because he was
   unrighteously afflicted by his enemies. And surely if we desire to be
   favored with the assistance of God, we ought to see to it that we fight
   under his standard. David, therefore, calls him a judge of
   righteousness, or, which is the same thing, a righteous judge; as if he
   had said, God has acted towards me according to his ordinary manner and
   constant principle of acting, for it is his usual way to undertake the
   defense of good causes. I am more inclined to render the words, Thou
   sittest a just judge, than to render them, O just judge, thou sittest,
   [168] because the form of expression, according to the first reading,
   is more emphatic. The import of it is this: God at length has assumed
   the character of judge, and is gone up into his judgment-seat to
   execute the office of judge. On this account he glories in having law
   and right on his side, and declares that God was the maintainer of his
   right and cause. What follows in the next verse, Thou hast destroyed
   [or discomfited,] the wicked, belongs also to the same subject. When he
   beholds his enemies overthrown, he does not rejoice in their
   destruction, considered simply in itself; but in condemning them on
   account of their unrighteousness, he says that they have received the
   punishment which they deserved. Under the name of nations he means,
   that it was not a small number of ungodly persons who were destroyed,
   but great armies, yea, even all who had risen up against him from
   different quarters. And the goodness of God shines forth the brighter
   in this, that, on account of the favor which he bare to one of his
   servants, he spared not even whole nations. When he says, Thou hast
   blotted out their name for ever, it may be understood as meaning, that
   they were destroyed without any hope of ever being able to rise again,
   and devoted to everlasting shame. We could not otherwise discern how
   God buries the name of the ungodly with themselves, did we not hear him
   declare that the memory of the righteous shall be for ever blessed,
   (Proverbs 10:7.)

   Psalm 9:6-8

   6. O thou enemy, desolations are come to an end for ever; and thou hast
   destroyed [or demolished [169] ] cities; their memory has perished with
   them. 7. And Jehovah sitteth for ever, he hath prepared his throne for
   judgment. 8. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
   judge the nations in uprightness.


   6. O thou enemy, desolations are come to an end for ever. This sixth
   verse is explained in different ways. Some read it interrogatively,
   viewing the letter h, as a mark of interrogation, as if David,
   addressing his discourse to his enemies, asked whether they had
   completed their work of devastation, even as they had resolved to
   destroy every thing; for the verb tmm, tamam, signifies sometimes to
   complete, and sometimes to put an end to any thing. And if we here take
   it in this sense, David, in the language of sarcasm or irony, rebukes
   the foolish confidence of his enemies. Others, reading the verse
   without any interrogation, make the irony still more evident, and think
   that David describes, in these three verses, a twofold state of
   matters; that, in the first place, (verse 6,) he introduces his enemies
   persecuting him with savage violence, and persevering with determined
   obstinacy in their cruelty, so that it seemed to be their fixed purpose
   never to desist until the kingdom of David should be utterly destroyed;
   and that, in the second place, (verses 7, 8) he represents God as
   seated on his judgment-seat, directly over against them, to repress
   their outrageous attempts. If this sense is admitted, the copulative,
   in the beginning of the seventh verse, which we have translated and,
   must be rendered by the adversative particle but, in this way: Thou, O
   enemy, didst seek after nothing except slaughter and the destruction of
   cities; but, at length, God has shown that he sits in heaven on his
   throne as judge, to put into proper order the things which are in
   confusion on the earth. According to others, David gives thanks to God,
   because, when the ungodly were fully determined to spread universal
   ruin around them, he put an end to their devastations. Others
   understand the words in a more restricted sense, as meaning that the
   desolations of the ungodly were completed, because God, in his just
   judgment, had made to fall upon their own heads the calamities and ruin
   which they had devised against David. According to others, David, in
   the 6th verse, complains that God had, for a long time, silently
   suffered the miserable devastation of his people, so that the ungodly,
   being left unchecked, wasted and destroyed all things according to
   their pleasure; and in the seventh verse, they think he subjoins for
   his consolation that God, notwithstanding, presides over human affairs.
   I have no objection to the view, that there is first described
   ironically how dreadful the power of the enemy was, when they put forth
   their highest efforts; and next, that there is set in opposition to it
   the judgment of God, which suddenly brought their proceedings to an
   abrupt termination, contrary to their expectation. They anticipated no
   such issue; for we know that the ungodly, although they may not presume
   openly to deprive God of his authority and dominion, yet run headlong
   to every excess of wickedness, not less boldly than if he were bound
   with fetters. [170] We have taken notice of an almost similar manner of
   speaking in a preceding psalm, (Psalm 7:13)

   This contrast between the power of the enemies of God and his people,
   and the work of God in breaking up their proceedings, very well
   illustrates the wonderful character of the succor which he granted to
   his people. The ungodly had set to themselves no limit in the work of
   doing mischief, save in the utter destruction of all things, and at the
   commencement complete destruction seemed to be at hand; but when things
   were in this state of confusion, God seasonably made his appearance for
   the help of his people. [171] As often, therefore, as nothing but
   destruction presents itself to our view, to whatever side we may turn,
   [172] let us remember to lift up our eyes to the heavenly throne,
   whence God beholds all that is done here below. In the world our
   affairs may have been brought to such an extremity, that there is no
   longer hope in regard to them; but the shield with which we ought to
   repel all the temptations by which we are assailed is this, that God,
   nevertheless, sits Judge in heaven. Yea, when he seems to take no
   notice of us, and does not immediately remedy the evils which we
   suffer, it becomes us to realize by faith his secret providence. The
   Psalmist says, in the first place, God sitteth for ever, by which he
   means, that however high the violence of men may be carried, and
   although their fury may burst forth without measure, they can never
   drag God from his seat. He farther means by this expression, that it is
   impossible for God to abdicate the office and authority of judge; a
   truth which he expresses more clearly in the second clause of the
   verse, He hath prepared his throne for judgment, in which he declares
   that God reigns not only for the purpose of making his majesty and
   glory surpassingly great, but also for the purpose of governing the
   world in righteousness.

   8. And he shall judge the world in righteousness. As David has just now
   testified, that the power of God is not inactive, so that he dwells in
   heaven only indulging himself in pleasures; but that it is a constantly
   operating power which he exercises in preserving his authority, and
   governing the world in righteousness and equity; so in this verse he
   adds the use of this doctrine, which is this, that the power of God is
   not shut up in heaven, but manifests itself in succouring men. The true
   doctrine on this subject, is not, like Epicurus, to imagine that God is
   a being wholly devoted to ease and pleasures, and who, satisfied with
   himself alone, has no care whatever about mankind, but to place him on
   the throne of power and equity, so that we may be fully persuaded, that
   although he does not immediately succor those who are unrighteously
   oppressed, yet there is not a moment in which he ceases to take a deep
   interest in them. And when he seems for a time to take no notice of
   things, the conclusion to which we should come most assuredly is, not
   that he deserts his office, but that he wishes hereby to exercise the
   patience of his people, and that, therefore, we should wait the issue
   in patience, and with tranquillity of mind. The demonstrative pronoun
   He, in my opinion, is of great weight. The import of it is, as if David
   had said, No one can deprive God of his office as Judge of the world,
   nor prevent him from extending his judgments to all nations. Whence it
   follows, that he will much more be the judge of his own people. David
   declares these judgments to be righteous, in order to induce us, when
   we are unrighteously and cruelly molested, to ask assistance from God,
   in the confident expectation of obtaining it; for since he judges the
   nations in righteousness, he will not suffer injustice and oppression
   always to reign with impunity in the world, nor deny his aid to the
   innocent.

   Psalm 9:9-12

   9. And Jehovah will be a refuge to the poor, and a protection in
   seasonable times in trouble. 10. And they that know thy name will put
   their trust in thee: for thou forsakest not them that seek thee, O
   Jehovah. 11. Sing unto Jehovah, who dwelleth in Sion, and proclaim his
   doings among the nations. 12. For in requiring blood, he hath
   remembered it: he hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.


   9. And Jehovah will be a refuge for the poor. David here furnishes a
   remedy for the temptation which greatly afflicts the weak, when they
   see themselves, and those who are like them, abandoned to the will of
   the ungodly, while God keeps silence. [173] He puts us in mind that God
   delays his aid, and to outward appearance forsakes his faithful ones,
   in order at length to succor them at a more convenient season,
   according to the greatness of their necessity and affliction. From this
   it follows, that he by no means ceases from the exercise of his office,
   although he suffer the good and the innocent to be reduced to extreme
   poverty, and although he exercise them with weeping and lamentations;
   for by doing this he lights up a lamp to enable them to see his
   judgments the more clearly. Accordingly, David expressly declares, that
   God interposes his protection seasonably in the afflictions of his
   people. The Lord will be a protection to the poor in seasonable times
   in trouble From this we are taught the duty of giving his providence
   time to make itself at length manifest in the season of need. And if
   protection by the power of God, and the experience of his fatherly
   favor, is the greatest blessing which we can receive, let us not feel
   so uneasy at being accounted poor and miserable before the world, but
   let this consolatory consideration assuage our grief, that God is not
   far from us, seeing our afflictions call upon him to come to our aid.
   Let us also observe, that God is said to be at hand in seasonable times
   when he succours the faithful during their affliction. [174] The Hebrew
   word vtsrh, batsarah, which occurs in the end of the 9th verse, is
   understood by some as if it were the simple word which signifies
   defense; but here they render it metaphorically distress, denoting
   those trying circumstances in which a person is so closely shut up, and
   reduced to such extremity, that he can find no escape. I, however,
   think there is more probability in the opinion of those who take v, the
   first letter of vtsrh, batsarah, as a servile letter meaning in, which
   is its ordinary signification. [175] What is here said, then, is, that
   God assists his own people in the time of need, namely, in affliction,
   or when they are weighed down with it, for then assistance is most
   necessary and most useful.

   In the tenth verse, the Psalmist teaches us, that when the Lord
   delivers the righteous, the fruit which results from it is, that they
   themselves, and all the rest of the righteous, acquire increasing
   confidence in his grace; for, unless we are fully persuaded that God
   exercises a care about men and human affairs, we must necessarily be
   troubled with constant disquietude. But as most men shut their eyes
   that they may not see the judgments of God, David restricts this
   advantage to the faithful alone, and, certainly, where there is no
   godliness, there is no sense of the works of God. It is also to be
   observed, that he attributes to the faithful the knowledge of God;
   because from this religion proceeds, whereas it is extinguished through
   the ignorance and stupidity of men. Many take the name of God simply
   for God himself; but, as I have observed in my remarks on a preceding
   psalm, I think something more is expressed by this term. As God's
   essence is hidden and incomprehensible, his name just means his
   character, so far as he has been pleased to make it known to us. David
   next explains the ground of this trust in God to be, that he does not
   forsake those who seek him God is sought in two ways, either by
   invocation and prayers, or by studying to live a holy and an upright
   life; and, indeed, the one is always inseparably joined with the other.
   But as the Psalmist is here treating of the protection of God, on which
   the safety of the godly depends, to seek God, as I understand it, is to
   betake ourselves to him for help and relief in danger and distress.

   11. Sing unto Jehovah. David, not contented with giving thanks
   individually, and on his own account, exhorts the faithful to unite
   with him, praising God, and to do this not only because it is their
   duty to stir up one another to this religious exercise, but because the
   deliverances of which he treats were worthy of being publicly and
   solemnly celebrated; and this is expressed more clearly in the second
   clause, where he commands them to be published among the nations. The
   meaning is, that they are not published or celebrated as they deserve,
   unless the whole world is filled with the renown of them. To proclaim
   God's doings among the nations was indeed, as it were, to sing to the
   deaf; but by this manner of speaking, David intended to show that the
   territory of Judea was too narrow to contain the infinite greatness of
   Jehovah's praises. He gives God this title, He who dwelleth in Sion, to
   distinguish him from all the false gods of the Gentiles. There is in
   the phrase a tacit comparison between the God who made his covenant
   with Abraham and Israel, and all the gods who, in every other part of
   the world except Judea, were worshipped according to the blinded and
   depraved fancies of men. It is not enough for persons to honor and
   reverence some deity indiscriminately or at random; they must
   distinctly yield to the only living and true God the worship which
   belongs to him, and which he commands. Moreover, as God had
   particularly chosen Sion as the place where his name might be called
   upon, David very properly assigns it to him as his peculiar
   dwelling-place, not that it is lawful to attempt to shut up, in any
   particular place, Him whom "the heaven of heavens cannot contain," (1
   Kings 8:1.) but because, as we shall afterwards see, (Psalm 132:12) he
   had promised to make it his rest for ever. David did not, according to
   his own fancy, assign God a dwelling-place there; but he understood, by
   a revelation from heaven, that such was the pleasure of God himself, as
   Moses had often predicted, (Deuteronomy 12:1.) This goes far to prove
   what I have said before, that this psalm was not composed upon the
   occasion of David's victory over Goliath; for it was only towards the
   close of David's reign that the ark of the covenant was removed to Sion
   according to the commandment of God. The conjecture of some that David
   spake by the Spirit of prophecy of the residence of the ark on Sion, as
   a future event, appears to me to be unnatural and forced. Farther, we
   see that the holy fathers, when they resorted to Sion to offer
   sacrifices to God, did not act merely according to the suggestion of
   their own minds; but what they did proceeded from faith in the word of
   God, and was done in obedience to his command; and they were,
   therefore, approved of by him for their religious service. Whence it
   follows, that there is no ground whatever to make use of their example
   as an argument or excuse for the religious observances which
   superstitious men have, by their own fancy, invented for themselves.
   Besides, it was not enough for the faithful, in those days, to depend
   upon the word of God, and to engage in those ceremonial services which
   he required, unless, aided by external symbols, they elevated their
   minds above these, and yielded to God spiritual worship. God, indeed,
   gave real tokens of his presence in that visible sanctuary, but not for
   the purpose of binding the senses and thoughts of his people to earthly
   elements; he wished rather that these external symbols should serve as
   ladders, by which the faithful might ascend even to heaven. The design
   of God from the commencement in the appointment of the sacraments, and
   all the outward exercises of religion, was to consult the infirmity and
   weak capacity of his people. Accordingly, even at the present day, the
   true and proper use of them is, to assist us in seeking God spiritually
   in his heavenly glory, and not to occupy our minds with the things of
   this world, or keep them fixed in the vanities of the flesh, a subject
   which we shall afterwards have a more suitable opportunity of
   discussing more fully. And as the Lord, in ancient times, when he
   called himself, He who dwelleth in Sion, intended to give his people
   full and solid ground of trust, tranquillity, and joy; so even now,
   after the law has come out of Sion, and the covenant of grace has
   flowed to us from that fountain, let us know and be fully persuaded,
   that wherever the faithful, who worship him purely and in due form,
   according to the appointment of his word, are assembled together to
   engage in the solemn acts of religious worship, he is graciously
   present, and presides in the midst of them.

   12. For in requiring blood. In the original, it is bloods, in the
   plural number, and, therefore, the relative which follows immediately
   after, And remembereth THEM, may very properly be referred to that word
   in this way, He requireth bloods, and remembereth them. But as it is
   sufficiently common in Hebrew to invert the order of the antecedent and
   the relative, and to put them before the word to which it refers, [176]
   some explain it of the poor, thus: In requiring blood, he hath
   remembered them, namely, the poor, of whom he speaks a little after. As
   to the sum and substance of the matter, it is of small importance in
   which of these ways we explain the relative; but the former is, in my
   view, the more natural explanation. There is here a repetition of what
   the Psalmist had said a little before, that we ought especially to
   consider God's power, as it is manifested in the mercy which he
   exercises towards his servants, who are unrighteously persecuted by
   wicked men. From the numerous works of God, he selects one which he
   commends as especially worthy of being remembered, namely, his work in
   delivering the poor from death. God sometimes leaves them in his holy
   providence to be persecuted by men; but at length he takes vengeance
   for the wrongs inflicted upon them. The words which David uses denote a
   continued act; but I have no doubt that he intends from those examples,
   which he has related in the preceding part of the psalm, to lead men to
   acknowledge that God requireth innocent blood, and remembers the cry of
   his people.

   He again insists on what I adverted to before, that God does not always
   put a stop to injuries so speedily as we would wish, nor break the
   attempts of the wicked at the first, but rather withholds and delays
   his assistance, so that it may seem that we cry to him in vain, a truth
   which it is of importance for us to understand; for if we measure the
   help of God according to our senses, our courage will ever and anon
   fail us, and in the end our hope will be entirely extinguished, and
   will give place to despondency and despair. We would fondly wish him,
   as I have said, to stretch forth his hand to a distance, and drive back
   the troubles which he sees to be prepared for us; yet he seems to take
   no notice, and does not prevent the blood of the innocent from being
   shed. Let this consolatory consideration, however, sustain us, that he
   will at length actually show how precious our blood was in his sight.
   If it is objected, that God's assistance comes too late, after we have
   endured all calamities, I answer, God delays to interfere no longer
   than he knows it to be of advantage for us to be humbled under the
   cross, and if he chooses rather to take vengeance after we have
   suffered outrage, than to aid us previous to the infliction of evil, it
   is not because he is not always willing and ready to succor us; but
   because he knows it is not always a proper time for manifesting his
   grace. By the way, it is a striking evidence, not only of his fatherly
   love towards us, but of the blessed immortality which is the portion of
   all the children of God, that he has a care about them even after they
   are dead. Were he always by his grace to prevent affliction from
   befalling us, who is there amongst us who would not be wholly attached
   to the present life? When, however, he avenges our death, from this it
   appears that, though dead, we still remain alive in his presence. For
   he does not, after the manner of men, hold in estimation the memory of
   those whom he could not preserve alive, [177] but he actually shows
   that he cherishes in his bosom, and gives protection to those who seem
   to be no more, viewing them according to the flesh. And this is the
   reason why David says that he remembereth blood when he requireth it;
   for although he may not presently deliver his servants from the swords
   of the wicked, yet he suffers not their murder to pass unpunished. To
   the same purpose is the last clause He forgetteth not the cry of the
   afflicted God may not show, by granting instant deliverance or relief,
   that he lends an immediate ear to the complaints of his servants; but
   at length he proves unanswerably that he has regarded them. Express
   mention is made of crying, to encourage all who desire to experience
   God as their deliverer and protector, to direct their wishes,
   groanings, and prayers to him.

   Psalm 9:13-14

   13. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, see my affliction which I suffer
   from those who persecute me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of
   death. 14. That I may recount all thy praises in the gates of the
   daughter of Sion; and that I may rejoice in thy salvation.


   13. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah. I think that this is the second part
   of the psalm. Others, however, are of a different opinion, and consider
   that David, according to his frequent practice, while giving thanks to
   God for the deliverance wrought for him, mingles with his thanksgiving
   an account of what had been the matter of his prayer in the extremity
   of his distress; and examples of the same kind, I confess, are every
   where to be met with in the Psalms. But when I consider all the
   circumstances more attentively, I am constrained to incline to the
   other opinion, namely, that in the commencement he celebrated the
   favors conferred upon him in order to make way for prayer; and the
   psalm is at last concluded with a prayer. He does not, therefore, in
   passing here insert the prayers which he had formerly made in the midst
   of his dangers and anxieties; but he purposely implores help from God
   at the present time, [178] and asks that He, whom he had often
   experienced as his deliverer, would continue the exercise of the same
   grace towards him. His enemies, perhaps, whom he had already vanquished
   on various occasions, having gathered new courage, and raised new
   forces, made a desperate effort, as we often see those who are driven
   to despair rush upon their enemies just with the greater impetuosity
   and rage. It is indeed certain, that David, when he offered this
   prayer, was seized with the greatest fear; for he would not, on account
   of a small matter, have called upon God to witness his affliction in
   the way he here does. It ought to be observed, that while he humbly
   betakes himself to the mercy of God, he bears, with a patient and
   submissive mind, the cross which was laid upon him. [179] But we ought
   chiefly to mark the title which he gives to God, calling him his lifter
   up from the gates of death; for we could not find a more appropriate
   expression than to lift up for the Hebrew word mrvmm, meromem. By this
   the Psalmist, in the first place, strengthens his faith from his past
   experience, inasmuch as he had often been delivered from the greatest
   dangers. And, in the second place, he assures himself of deliverance,
   even in the very jaws of death; because God is accustomed not only to
   succor his servants, and to deliver them from their calamities by
   ordinary means, but also to bring them from the grave, even after all
   hope of life is cut off; for the gates of death is a metaphorical
   expression, denoting the utmost perils which threaten destruction, or
   rather, which lay the grave open before us. In order, therefore, that
   neither the weight of the calamities which we presently endure, nor the
   fear of those which we see impending over us, may overwhelm our faith,
   or interrupt our prayers, let us call to our remembrance that the
   office of lifting up his people from the gates of death is not ascribed
   to God in vain.

   14. That I may recount. David's meaning simply is, that he will
   celebrate the praises of God in all assemblies, and, wherever there is
   the greatest concourse of people, (for at that time it was the custom
   to hold assemblies at the gates of cities;) but, at the same time,
   there seems to be an allusion to the gates of death, of which he has
   just spoken, as if he had said, After I am delivered from the grave, I
   will do my endeavor to bear testimony, in the most public manner, to
   the goodness of God, manifested in my deliverance. As, however, it is
   not sufficient to utter the praises of God with our tongues, if they do
   not proceed from the heart, the Psalmist, in the last clause of the
   verse, expresses the inward joy with which he would engage in this
   exercise, And that I may rejoice in thy salvation; as if he had said, I
   desire to live in this world for no other purpose than to rejoice in
   having been preserved by the grace of God. Under the name of daughter,
   as is well known, the Jews meant a people or city, but he here names
   the city from its principal part, namely, Sion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] "In the 12th verse," says Horsley, "the Psalmist having mentioned
   it as a part of the divine character, that God forgetteth not the cry
   of the helpless, naturally thinks upon his own helpless state, and in
   the 13th and 14th verses cries for deliverance. The promise of the
   overthrow of the faction, which were the principal instruments of his
   affliction, recurring to his thoughts, he breaks out again in the 15th
   verse in strains of exultation." The transition from the language of
   triumph, in the preceding part of the psalm, to the language of prayer
   and complaint in the 13th verse, and the mixture of triumph and
   complaint in the sequel of the psalm, are very remarkable. This was the
   natural effect of the Psalmist's present distressed condition. The
   pressure of his affliction excited him, on the one hand, to utter the
   language of dejection; while his confident expectation of deliverance
   prompted him, on the other hand, to utter the language of triumph.

   [179] "Or il faut noter que quand il ya humblement au recours a la
   misericorde de Dieu, c'est signe qu'il portoit doucement et patienment,
   la croix que Dieu luy avoir comme raise sur les espaules." -- Fr. "But
   it ought to be observed, that, while he humbly betakes himself to the
   mercy of God, it is a sign that he bore, submissively and patiently,
   the cross which God had, as it were, laid upon his shoulders."

   Psalm 9:15-16

   15. The heathen are sunk into the pit which they made; in the net which
   they have hid are their own feet taken. 16. Jehovah is known by
   executing judgment. The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.
   Higgaion. Selah.


   15. The heathen are sunk. David being now raised up to holy confidence,
   triumphs over his enemies. In the first place, he says metaphorically,
   that they were taken in their own craftiness and snares. He next
   expresses the same thing without figure, that they were snared in their
   own wickedness. And he affirms that this happened not by chance, but
   was the work of God, and a striking proof of his judgment. When he
   compares his enemies to hunters or fowlers, it is not without having
   just ground for doing so. The wicked, it is true, often commit violence
   and outrage, yet in deceits and cunning artifices they always imitate
   their father Satan, who is the father of lies, and, therefore, whatever
   ingenuity they have, they employ it in practising wickedness and in
   devising mischief. As often, therefore, as wicked men cunningly plot
   our destruction, let us remember that it is no new thing for them to
   lay nets and snares for the children of God. At the same time, let us
   comfort ourselves from the reflection, that whatever they may attempt
   against us, the issue is not in their power, and that God will be
   against them, not only to frustrate their designs, but also to surprise
   them in the wicked devices which they frame, and to make all their
   resources of mischief to fall upon their own heads.

   16. The Lord is known in executing judgment. The reading of the words
   literally is this, The known Lord has done judgment. This manner of
   speech is abrupt, and its very brevity renders it obscure. It is
   therefore explained in two ways. Some explain it thus:- God begins then
   to be known when he punishes the wicked. But the other sense suits the
   passage better, namely, that it is a thing obvious and manifest to all
   that God executes the office of judge, as often as he ensnares the
   wicked in their own maliciousness. In short, whenever God turns back
   upon themselves whatever schemes of mischief they devise, David
   declares that in this case the divine judgment is so evident, that what
   happens can be ascribed neither to nature nor to fortune. If God,
   therefore, in this way manifestly display, at any time, the power of
   his hand, let us learn to open our eyes, that from the judgments which
   he executes upon the enemies of his Church our faith may be confirmed
   more and more. As to the word Higgaion, which properly signifies
   meditation, I cannot at present assign a better reason why it has been
   inserted than this, that David intended to fix the minds of the godly
   in meditation upon the judgments of God. The word Selah was intended to
   answer the same purpose, and as I have said before, regulated the
   singing in such a manner as to make the music correspond to the words
   and the sentiment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 9:17-18

   17. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
   forget God. 18. For the poor shall not always be forgotten; the hope of
   the humble shall not perish for ever.


   17. The wicked shall be turned into hell. Many translate the verb in
   the optative mood, Let the wicked be turned into hell, as if it were an
   imprecation. But, in my judgment, David here rather confirms himself
   and all the godly with respect to the future, declaring that whatever
   the wicked may attempt, it will have a termination disastrous to
   themselves. By the word turn he means that the issue will be far
   otherwise than what they imagine; for there is implied in it a tacit
   contrast between the height of their presumption and the depth of their
   fall. As they have no fear of God, they exalt themselves above the
   clouds; and then, as if they had "made a covenant with death,"
   according to the language of Isaiah, (Isaiah 28:15) they become so much
   the more arrogant and presumptuous. But when we see them raging without
   apprehension of danger, the prophet warns us that their madness carries
   them headlong, so that, at length, they fall into the grave, from which
   they thought themselves to be a great way off. Here, then, is described
   to us the sudden and unexpected change, by which God, when he pleases,
   restores to order things which were in confusion. When, therefore, we
   see the wicked flying aloft devoid of all fear, let us, by the eyes of
   faith, behold the grave which is prepared for them; and rest assured
   that the hand of God, although it is unseen, is very near, which can
   turn them back in the midst of their course in which they aim at
   reaching heaven, and make them tumble into hell in a moment. The
   meaning of the Hebrew word s'vlh, sheolah, is doubtful, but I have not
   hesitated to translate it hell [180] I do not find fault with those who
   translate it the grave, but it is certain that the prophet means
   something more than common death, otherwise he would here say nothing
   else with respect to the wicked than what would also happen to all the
   faithful in common with them. Though then, he does not speak in express
   terms of eternal destruction, but only says, They shall be turned into
   the grave, yet, under the metaphor of the grave, he intimates that all
   the ungodly shall perish, and that the presumption with which, by every
   unlawful means, they raise themselves on high to trample righteousness
   under foot, and to oppress the innocent, shall bring upon them ruin and
   perdition. The faithful, also, it is true, descend into the grave, but
   not with such fearful violence as plunges them into it without hope of
   coming out again. So far is this from being the case, that even when
   shut up in the grave, they dwell already in heaven by hope.

   18. For the poor shall not always be forgotten. The assertion that God
   will not forsake the poor and afflicted for ever, is a confirmation of
   the preceding sentence. By it he intimates, that they may indeed seem
   to be forsaken for a time. Let us, therefore, remember that God has
   promised his assistance to us, not in the way of preventing our
   afflictions, but of at length succouring us after we have been long
   subdued under the cross. David speaks expressly of hope or expectation,
   thereby to encourage us to prayer. The reason why God seems to take no
   notice of our afflictions is, because he would have us to awaken him by
   means of our prayers; for when he hears our requests, (as if he began
   but then to be mindful of us,) he stretches forth his powerful hand to
   help us. David again repeats that this is not done immediately, in
   order that we may persevere in hoping well, even although our
   expectations may not be instantly gratified.

   Psalm 9:19-20

   19. Arise, O Jehovah; let not man [181] prevail: let the nations be
   judged in thy sight. 20. Put them in fear, O Jehovah; that the nations
   may know that they are men.


   19. Arise, O Jehovah. When David beseeches God to arise, the expression
   does not strictly apply to God, but it refers to external appearance
   and to our senses; for we do not perceive God to be the deliverer of
   his people except when he appears before our eyes, as it were sitting
   upon the judgment-seat. There is added a consideration or reason to
   induce God to avenge the injuries done to his people, namely, that man
   may not prevail; for when God arises, all the fierceness [182] of the
   ungodly must immediately fall down and give way. Whence is it that the
   wicked become so audaciously insolent, or have so great power to work
   mischief, if it is not because God is still, and gives them loose
   reins? But, as soon as he shows some token of his judgment, he
   immediately puts a stop to their proud tumults, [183] and breaks their
   strength and power with his nod alone. [184] We are taught, by this
   manner of praying, that however insolently and proudly our enemies may
   boast of what they will do, yet they are in the hand of God, and can do
   no more than what he permits them; and farther, that God can doubtless,
   whenever he pleases, render all their endeavors vain and ineffectual.
   The Psalmist, therefore, in speaking of them, calls them man. The word
   in the original is 'nvs, enosh, which is derived from a root signifying
   misery or wretchedness, and, accordingly, it is the same thing as if he
   had called them mortal or frail man. Farther, the Psalmist beseeches
   God to judge the heathen before his face God is said to do this when he
   compels them, by one means or another, to appear before his
   judgment-seat. We know that unbelievers, until they are dragged by
   force into the presence of God, turn their backs upon him as much as
   they can, in order to exclude from their minds all thought of him as
   their Judge.

   20. Put them in fear, O Jehovah. The Septuagint translates mvrh, morah,
   [nomothetes,] a lawgiver, deriving it from yrh, yarah, which sometimes
   signifies to teach. [185] But the scope of the passage requires that we
   should understand it of fear or dread; and this is the opinion of all
   sound expositors. Now, it is to be considered of what kind of fear
   David speaks. God commonly subdues even his chosen ones to obedience by
   means of fear. But as he moderates his rigour towards them, and, at the
   same time, softens their stony hearts, so that they willingly and
   quietly submit themselves to him, he cannot be properly said to compel
   them by fear. With respect to the reprobate, he takes a different way
   of dealing. As their obduracy is inflexible, so that it is easier to
   break than to bend them, he subdues their desperate obstinacy by force;
   not, indeed, that they are reformed, but, whether they will or no, an
   acknowledgement of their own weakness is extorted from them. They may
   gnash their teeth and boil with rage, and even exceed in cruelty wild
   beasts, but when the dread of God seizes upon them, they are thrown
   down with their own violence, and fall with their own weight. Some
   explain these words as a prayer that God would bring the nations under
   the yoke of David, and make them tributaries to his government; but
   this is a cold and forced explanation. The word fear comprehends in
   general all the plagues of God, by which is repulsed, as by the heavy
   blows of a hammer, [186] the rebellion of those who would never obey
   him except by compulsion.

   There follows next the point to which the nations must be brought,
   namely, to acknowledge themselves to be mortal men. This, at first
   sight, seems to be a matter of small importance; but the doctrine which
   it contains is far from being trifling. What is man, that he dares of
   himself to move a finger? And yet all the ungodly run to excess as
   boldly and presumptuously as if there were nothing to hinder them from
   doing whatever they please. It is certainly through a distempered
   imagination that they claim to themselves what is peculiar to God; and,
   in short, they would never run to so great excess if they were not
   ignorant of their own condition. David, when he beseeches God to strike
   the nations with terror, that they may know that they are men, [187]
   does not mean that the ungodly will profit so much under the rods and
   chastisements of God as to humble themselves truly and from the heart;
   but the knowledge of which he speaks just means an experience of their
   own weakness. His language is as if he had said, Lord, since it is
   their ignorance of themselves which hurries them into their rage
   against me, make them actually to experience that their strength is not
   equal to their infatuated presumption, and after they are disappointed
   of their vain hopes, let them lie confounded and abased with shame. It
   may often happen that those who are convinced of their own weakness do
   not yet reform; but much is gained when their ungodly presumption is
   exposed to mockery and scorn before the world, that it may appear how
   ridiculous was the confidence which they presumed to place in their own
   strength. With respect to the chosen of God, they ought to profit under
   his chastisements after another manner. It becomes them to be humbled
   under a sense of their own weakness, and willingly to divest themselves
   of all vain confidence and presumption. And this will be the case if
   they remember that they are but men. Augustine has well and wisely
   said, that the whole humility of man consists in the knowledge of
   himself. Moreover, since pride is natural to all, God requires to
   strike terror into all men indiscriminately, that, on the one hand, his
   own people may learn to be humble, and that, on the other hand, the
   wicked, although they cease not to elevate themselves above the
   condition of man, may be put back with shame and confusion.

   [185] The Chaldee version reads fear, but the Syriac, Ethiopic, and

   adopted the reading of the Septuagint, render the words, "Set, O Lord,
   a lawgiver over them;" and it was their opinion that lawgiver means
   antichrist, to whom God in his wrath gave dominion over the nations.
   According to others, lawgiver means Christ. Dr Horsley reads, "O
   Jehovah, appoint thou a teacher over them." Ainsworth and Dr Adam
   Clarke adopt the same rendering, and view the words as a prayer that
   the nations may learn humility and piety, that they may know their
   accountability to God, and become wise unto salvation.

   PSALM 10.

   David here complains, in his own name, and in the name of all the
   godly, that fraud, extortion, cruelty, violence, and all kind of
   injustice, prevailed every where in the world; and the cause which he
   assigns for this is, that ungodly and wicked men, being intoxicated
   with their prosperity, have shaken off all fear of God, and think they
   may do whatever they please with impunity. Accordingly, he earnestly
   beseeches God to help him, and to remedy his desperate calamities. In
   the close, he comforts himself and the rest of the faithful with the
   hope of obtaining deliverance in due time. This description represents,
   as in a mirror, a lively image of a widely corrupt and disorganised
   state of society. When, therefore, we see iniquity breaking out like a
   flood, that the strangeness of such a temptation may not shake the
   faith of the children of God and cause them to fall into despair, let
   them learn to look into this mirror. It tends greatly to lighten grief,
   to consider that nothing befalls us at this day which the Church of God
   has not experienced in the days of old; yea, rather that we are just
   called to engage in the same conflicts with which David and the other
   holy patriarchs were exercised. Farther, the faithful are admonished to
   have recourse to God in such a confused state of things; for unless
   they are convinced that it belongs to God to succor them, and to remedy
   such a state of matters, they will gain nothing by indulging in
   confused murmurings, and rending the air with their cries and
   complaints.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 10:1-2

   1. Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? and winkest at seasonable
   times in trouble? [188] 2. The ungodly in his pride doth persecute the
   poor; [189] let them be caught in the devices [190] which they imagine.


   1. Lord, why standest thou afar off? We here see how the prophet,
   seeking a remedy for his calamities, which were apparently past hope,
   directly addresses himself to God at the very commencement. And the
   rule which we should observe, when we are in trouble and sorrow, is
   this: We should seek comfort and solace in the providence of God; for
   amidst our agitations, vexations, and cares, we ought to be fully
   persuaded that it is his peculiar office to give relief to the wretched
   and afflicted. It is in an improper sense, and by anthropathy, [191]
   that the Psalmist speaks of God as standing afar off. Nothing can be
   hid from his eyes; but as God permits us to speak to him as we do to
   one another, these forms of expression do not contain any thing absurd,
   provided we understand them as applied to God, not in a strict sense,
   but only figuratively, according to the judgment which mere sense forms
   from the present appearance of things. It is possible that a righteous
   man may not check an injury which is done to a poor man before his
   eyes, because he is destitute of the power; but this cannot be the case
   with respect to God, who is always armed with invincible power. If,
   therefore, he act as if he took no notice, it is the same as if he
   withdrew himself afar off. The word tlym, taelim, which signifies to
   hide, is explained in two ways. According to some, David here complains
   of God for hiding himself, as if he accounted the care of human affairs
   beneath him. Others understand it as meaning to shut the eyes; and this
   appears to me to be the more simple view. It is to be observed, that
   although David here complains that God kept himself afar off, he was,
   notwithstanding, fully persuaded of his presence with him, otherwise it
   would have been in vain to have called upon him for aid. The
   interrogation which he employs is to this effect: Lord, since it is thy
   prerogative to govern the world, and also to regulate it by thy
   righteousness as thou sustainest it by thy power, why is it that thou
   dost not more quickly show thyself a defender of thine own people
   against the arrogance and incredible pride of the ungodly? David,
   however, speaks thus not so much in the way of complaining, as to
   encourage himself in the confidence of obtaining what he desired.
   Through the infirmity of sense, he says, that it is unbecoming of God
   to cease so long from executing his office; and yet, at the same time,
   he fails not to yield to him the honor which is his due, and by his
   prayers he deposits into his bosom the great burden of trouble with
   which he was laden. The expression which follows, at needful times,
   relates to the same subject. Although God may not stretch forth his
   hand to take vengeance [192] at every moment, yet when he beholds the
   simple and innocent oppressed, it is not time for him to defer any
   longer. David briefly defines the fit time for putting the hand to the
   work to be when the faithful are in distress. Of this form of speech we
   have spoken in the preceding psalm, at the tenth verse.

   2. The ungodly in his pride, etc Before uttering his prayer against the
   ungodly, the Psalmist briefly sets forth their wickedness in cruelly
   vexing the afflicted, for no other reason but because they disdain and
   despise them, through the pride with which they are inflated. And their
   cruelty is not a little enhanced from this, that, forgetful of all
   humanity, they contemptuously triumph over the poor and afflicted,
   mocking them and inflicting injuries upon them. [193] Cruelty is,
   indeed, always proud, yea, rather, pride is the mother of all wrongs;
   for if a man did not through pride magnify himself above his neighbors,
   and through an overweening conceit of himself despise them, even common
   humanity would teach us with what humility and justice we ought to
   conduct ourselves towards each other. But David here intended to state
   that the only cause why the ungodly, whom he accuses, exercise their
   cruelty against the wretched and the needy, from whom they receive no
   provocation, is the pride and arrogance of their own spirits. Let every
   one, therefore, who desires to live justly and unblameably with his
   brethren, beware of indulging or taking pleasure in treating others
   disdainfully; and let him endeavor, above all things, to have his mind
   freed from the disease of pride. The word dlq, dalak, signifies to
   suffer persecution, as well as to persecute; and, therefore, some
   prefer translating the words, The poor is persecuted in the pride of
   the ungodly. [194] They may also not improperly be rendered thus, The
   poor burns in the pride of the ungodly, because this is the more common
   signification of the word. The pride of the wicked, like fire, devours
   the poor and afflicted.

   this ambiguous word; being in doubt whether the petition against the
   wicked be that they may be ruined by their own stratagems against the
   righteous, or that they may be the dupes of their own atheistical
   speculations upon moral and religious subjects. It seems to me that the
   word mzmvt, may signify either crafty tricks,' or refined theories,'
   and, in this latter sense, it is used in the fourth verse." Horsley
   considers this psalm as a general description of the oppression of the
   righteous by apostate spirits, atheists, and idolaters, who have all
   conspired against them, and not as referring to any particular calamity
   of the Jewish nation, or of any individual.

   rs, rasha, the wicked, in the active tense, -- the wicked persecutes
   the poor, yet the ancient interpreters generally render it in the
   passive, and apply it to ny, anay, the poor, that in the pride of the
   wicked he is set on fire, that is, brought into great tribulation." --
   Hammond. The word used by the Septuagint is empurizetai. There may be
   an allusion in the Hebrew word to the fires which persecutors have
   kindled for burning to death the confessors and martyrs of Christ.

   Psalm 10:3-4

   3. For the ungodly praiseth himself on account of the desire of his own
   soul; and the violent man blesseth himself; he despiseth Jehovah. 4.
   The ungodly, in the pride of his countenance, [195] inquireth not: all
   his devices say, There is no God.


   3. For the ungodly praiseth himself. This verse is variously explained.
   Literally the reading is, For praiseth the wicked or ungodly; and it is
   therefore necessary to supply some word, but what word is disputed.
   [196] Some translate the words, ungodly and violent man, in the
   accusative case, thus: He praiseth the ungodly, and blesseth the
   violent man; because they think it strange that after "praiseth" the
   sentence should end abruptly, without any thing being said of who or
   what was praised. But since it is quite common in Hebrew, when the
   agent and the subject are one and the same person, to express the word
   only once, while we repeat it in order to complete the sense, the
   interpretation which I have followed appears to me the most proper,
   namely, that the ungodly man praises himself, and boasts of the desire
   of his soul, and blesses himself. Now, it may be asked, What is this
   desire of soul? It is usually understood in this sense, [197] that the
   ungodly flatter and applaud themselves, while fortune smiles on them,
   and they obtain their wishes, and enjoy whatever they desire; just as
   David adds, a little after, that they abuse their prosperity, in
   attempting whatever comes into their fancy. But, in my opinion, desire
   of soul here denotes rather lust, and the intemperate gratification of
   passion and appetite; and thus the meaning is, that they indulge
   themselves with delight in their depraved desires, and, despising the
   judgment of God, fearlessly absolve themselves from all guilt, maintain
   their innocence, [198] and justify their impiety. Moses uses a similar
   form of expression in Deuteronomy 29:19,

   "I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart."

   David, indeed, says a little after, that the ungodly abuse their
   prosperity, by flattering themselves; but here, in my judgment, he
   expresses something more weighty, namely, that they acquire praise from
   their presumptuousness, and glory in their wickedness; and this foolish
   confidence, or bold assurance, is the cause of their throwing off all
   restraint and breaking forth into every kind of excess. Accordingly, I
   interpret the words praise and bless as having the same meaning, just
   as the words, ungodly and violent man, are synonymous in this place,
   although they differ from each other as genus and species. With these
   statements agrees what is immediately added in the end of the verse
   that these ungodly persons despise God. To translate the verb, to
   blaspheme, as has been done by some, or to provoke to anger, as has
   been done by others, is too remote from the scope of the passage. David
   rather teaches, that the cause of their careless indulgence in the
   gratification of their lusts, is their base contempt of God. He who
   duly reflects that God will be his judge is so much alarmed by this
   reflection, that he dares not bless his soul while his conscience
   accuses him of guilt and of being given to the practice of sin. [199]

   4. The ungodly, in the pride of his countenance, etc Others translate
   the words, The ungodly man, by reason of the violence of his anger, or,
   in the pride which he displays, does not inquire after God. But this
   partly perverts the meaning, and partly weakens the force of what David
   intended to express. In the first place, the word inquire, which is
   here put absolutely, that is, without any noun which it governs, is,
   according to this translation, improperly limited to God. David simply
   means, that the ungodly, without examination, permit themselves to do
   any thing, or do not distinguish between what is lawful and unlawful,
   because their own lust is their law, yea, rather, as if superior to all
   laws, they fancy that it is lawful for them to do whatever they please.
   The beginning of well-doing in a man's life is inquiry; in other words,
   we can only begin to do well when we keep ourselves from following,
   without choice and discrimination, the dictates of our own fancy, and
   from being carried away by the wayward propensities of our flesh. But
   the exercise of inquiring proceeds from humility, when we assign to
   God, as is reasonable, the place of judge and ruler over us. The
   prophet, therefore, very properly says, that the reason why the
   ungodly, without any regard or consideration, presume to do whatever
   they desire, is because, being lifted up with pride, they leave to God
   nothing whatever of the prerogative of a judge. The Hebrew word phph,
   aph, which we have translated countenance, I have no doubt is here
   taken in its proper and natural signification, and not metaphorically
   for anger; because haughty persons show their effrontery even by their
   countenance.

   In the second clause, the prophet more severely, or, at least, more
   openly, accuses them, declaring that all their wicked imaginations show
   that they have no God. All his devices say, There is no God [200] By
   these words I understand, that through their heaven-daring presumption,
   they subvert all piety and justice, as if there were no God sitting in
   heaven. Did they truly believe that there is a God, the fear of the
   judgment to come would restrain them. Not that they plainly and
   distinctly deny the existence of a God, but then they strip him of his
   power. Now, God would be merely like an idol, if, contented with an
   inactive existence, he should divest himself of his office as judge.
   Whoever, therefore, refuse to admit that the world is subject to the
   providence of God, or do not believe that his hand is stretched forth
   from on high to govern it, do as much as in them lies to put an end to
   the existence of God. It is not, however, enough to have some cold and
   unimpressive knowledge of him in the head; it is only the true and
   heartfelt conviction of his providence which makes us reverence him,
   and which keeps us in subjection [201] to him. The greater part of
   interpreters understand the last clause as meaning generally, that all
   the thoughts of a wicked man tend to the denial of a God. In my
   opinion, the Hebrew word mzmvt, mezimmoth, is here, as in many other
   places, taken in a bad sense for cunning and wicked thoughts, [202] so
   that the meaning, as I have noticed already, is this: Since the ungodly
   have the hardihood to devise and perpetrate every kind of wickedness,
   however atrocious, it is from this sufficiently manifest, that they
   have cast off all fear of God from their hearts.

   Psalm 10:5-6

   5. His ways are prosperous at all times; on high are thy judgments
   before him; he puffeth at all his enemies. 6. He saith in his heart, I
   shall not be moved from generation to generation, because he is not in
   adversity.


   There is a great diversity of opinion among interpreters respecting the
   first clause of this verse. The translators of the Septuagint version,
   thinking the word ychylv, yachilu, which is in the future tense,
   derived from the root chll, chalal, which it is not, have rendered it,
   his ways are defiled. But it is agreed among the Jewish expositors,
   that it is derived from the root chvl, chol. Many among them, however,
   take it actively for to put one in fear, or to put one to trouble, as
   if it had been said, The ways of the ungodly are dreadful to the good,
   and torment them. [203] Some also apply the words to God, reading the
   sentence thus, His ways come, that is to say, have their course, or
   prosper at all times. This, however, in my judgment, is too forced. But
   as this word, in other texts of Scripture, means to be prosperous, I am
   surprised that there should be any difference of opinion among the
   learned concerning this passage, when immediately, in the next clause,
   the prophet clearly shows that he is speaking of the prosperous
   condition of the ungodly, and the continued course of pleasure which
   intoxicates them. He not only complains of this their prosperity, but
   from it he aggravates their guilt, in that they take occasion, from the
   goodness of God, to harden themselves in their wickedness. I would,
   therefor explain the verse thus: As they enjoy a continued course of
   prosperity, they dream that God is bound or plighted to them, and hence
   they put his judgments far from them; and if any man oppose them, they
   are confident they can immediately put him down, or dash him to pieces
   with a puff or breath. Now, we understand the simple meaning of the
   prophet to be, that the ungodly mock God, taking encouragement from his
   forbearance; as that base tyrant, Dionysius, because he had a
   prosperous voyage, after having plundered the temple of Proserpine,
   [204] boasted that God favored the sacrilegious. [205] Hence it is,
   that they put far from them the judgments of God.

   In the opinion of some, these words, On high are thy judgments before
   him, mean much the same thing as if the prophet had said, God treats
   them with too much clemency, and spares them; just as he elsewhere
   complains of their being exempted from the common afflictions of life.
   But this interpretation does not so well agree with the words; yea, it
   appears to be unnatural and forced. The judgments of God then are said
   to be on high to the ungodly, because, presuming upon the great
   distance of God from them, [206] they promise themselves not only a
   truce with death during their whole life, but also an everlasting
   covenant with it. We see how, by procrastinating the evil day, they
   harden themselves, and become more and more obstinate in evil; [207]
   yea, persuading themselves that God is shut up in heaven, as if they
   had nothing to do with him, they strengthen themselves in the hope of
   escaping unpunished; [208] as we see them, in Isaiah, (Isaiah 22:13)
   jesting at the threatenings of the prophets, saying, "Let us eat and
   drink, for to-morrow we shall die." When the prophets, in order to
   inspire the people with terror, denounced the dreadful vengeance of
   God, which was ready to be inflicted upon them, these wicked men cried
   out that it was all whims or idle stories. God therefore bitterly
   inveighs against them, because, when he called the people to mourning,
   ashes, and sackcloth, these mockers encouraged them to minstrelsy and
   feasting; and at length he swears, "As I live, surely this iniquity
   shall not be purged from you till ye die." The faithful, indeed, lift
   up their eyes to heaven to behold the judgments of God; and they are
   not less afraid of them than if they were just ready to fall upon their
   heads. The ungodly, on the contrary, despise them, and yet, in order
   not to be disturbed or tormented with the fear or apprehension of them,
   they would banish them into heaven; just as the Epicureans, although
   they did not presume avowedly to deny the existence of a God, yet
   imagined that he is confined to heaven, where he indulges himself in
   idleness, without taking any concern about what is done here below.
   [209] From this infatuation flows their presumptuous confidence of
   which David speaks, by which they assure themselves of being able to
   destroy, with a puff or blast alone, all who are enemies to them. The
   word phvch, phuach, which sometimes signifies to ensnare, is here more
   properly taken for to puff, or to blow out.

   The Psalmist confirms these statements in the next verse, where he
   tells us that the persons of whom he speaks are fully persuaded in
   their hearts that they are beyond all danger of change. He saith in his
   heart, I shall not be moved from generation to generation The ungodly
   often pour forth proud language to this effect. David, however, only
   touches the hidden ulcer of their vile arrogance, which they cherish in
   their own breasts, and therefore he does not say what they speak with
   their mouth, but what they persuade themselves of in their hearts. It
   may here be asked, Why does David blame in others what he professes
   concerning himself in so many places? [210] for trusting to the
   protection of God, he courageously triumphs over all dangers. [211] And
   surely it becomes the children of God effectually to provide for their
   safety, so that, although the world should a hundred times fall into
   ruins, they may have the comfortable assurance that they will remain
   unmoved. The answer to this question is easy, and it is this, The
   faithful promise themselves security in God, and no where else; and yet
   while they do this, they know themselves to be exposed to all the
   storms of affliction, and patiently submit to them. There is a very
   great difference between a despiser of God who, enjoying prosperity
   today, is so forgetful of the condition of man in this world, as
   through a distempered imagination to build his nest above the clouds,
   and who persuades himself that he shall always enjoy comfort and
   repose, [212] -- there is a very great difference between him and the
   godly man, who, knowing that his life hangs only by a thread, and is
   encompassed by a thousand deaths, and who, ready to endure any kind of
   afflictions which shall be sent upon him, and living in the world as if
   he were sailing upon a tempestuous and dangerous sea, nevertheless,
   bears patiently all his troubles and sorrows, and comforts himself in
   his afflictions, because he leans wholly upon the grace of God, and
   entirely confides in it. [213] The ungodly man says, I shall not be
   moved, or I shall not shake for ever; because he thinks himself
   sufficiently strong and powerful to bear up against all the assaults
   which shall be made upon him. The faithful man says, What although I
   may happen to be moved, yea, even fall and sink into the lowest depths?
   my fall will not be fatal, for God will put his hand under me to
   sustain me. By this, in like manner, we are furnished with an
   explanation of the different effects which an apprehension of danger
   has upon the good and the bad. Good men may tremble and sink into
   despondency, but this leads them to flee with all haste to the
   sanctuary of God's grace; [214] whereas the ungodly, while they are
   affrighted even at the noise of a falling leaf, [215] and live in
   constant uneasiness, endeavor to harden themselves in their stupidity,
   and to bring themselves into such a state of giddy frenzy, that being,
   as it were, carried out of themselves, they may not feel their
   calamities. The cause assigned for the confidence with which the
   prosperous ungodly man persuades himself that no change shall come upon
   him is, because he is not in adversity This admits of two senses. It
   either means, that the ungodly, because they have been exempted from
   all calamity and misery during the past part of their life, entertain
   the hope of a peaceful and joyful state in the time to come; or it
   means, that through a deceitful imagination they exempt themselves from
   the common condition of men; just as in Isaiah, (Isaiah 28:15) they
   say,

   "When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
   it shall not come upon us."

   Psalm 10:7-10

   7. His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit, and malice: under his
   tongue are mischief and iniquity. 8. He will sit in the ensnaring
   places of the villages; in his lurking places will he murder the
   innocent: his eyes will take their aim against the poor. 9. He will lie
   in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; he will lie in wait to catch
   the poor; he will catch the poor by drawing him into his net. 10. He
   will crouch low, and cast himself down, and then shall an army of the
   afflicted fall by his strengths. [216]


   7. His mouth is full of cursing. The scope of these four verses is
   this: If God intends to succor his servants, it is now a proper time
   for doing so, inasmuch as the lawlessness of the ungodly has burst
   forth to the utmost possible excess. In the first place, he complains
   that their tongues are full of perjuries and deceits, and that they
   carry or hide mischief and wrongs, it being impossible to have any
   dealings with them in any matter without loss and damage. The word 'lh,
   alah, which some render cursing, does not signify the execrations which
   they throw out against others, but rather those which they call down
   upon their own heads: for they do not scruple to utter the most awful
   imprecations against themselves, that thereby they may the better
   succeed in deceiving others. It is, therefore, not improperly rendered
   by some, perjury, for this word ought to be joined to the other two,
   deceit and malice. Thus the wicked are described as cursing or swearing
   falsely, so far as it contributes to forward their purposes of
   deceiving and doing injury. Hence follow mischief and injustice,
   because it is impossible for the simple, without suffering detriment,
   to escape their snares, which are woven of deceits, perjuries, and
   malice.

   8. He will sit in the ensnaring places of the villages. [217] I have
   purposely avoided changing the verbs of the future tense into another
   tense, because they imply a continued act, and also because this Hebrew
   idiom has extended even to other languages. David, therefore, describes
   what ungodly men are accustomed to do. And, in the first place, he
   compares them to highwaymen, who lie in wait at the narrow parts of
   roads, and choose for themselves hiding-places from which they may fall
   upon travelers when off their guard. He says also, that their eyes are
   bent or leering, [218] by a similitude borrowed from the practice of
   dart-shooters, who take their aim with leering, or half shut eyes, in
   order to hit the mark the surer. Nor does he here speak of the common
   sort of highwaymen who are in the woods; [219] but he directs his
   language against those great robbers who hide their wickedness under
   titles of honor, and pomp, and splendor. The word chtsrym, chatserim,
   therefore, which we have rendered villages, is by some translated
   palaces; as if David had said, they have converted their royal mansions
   into places of robbery, where they may cut the throats of their unhappy
   victims. But granting the word to have this allusion, I consider that
   it refers principally to the practice of robbers, to which there is a
   reference in the whole verse, and I explain it thus: Like as robbers
   lie in wait at the egresses of villages, so these persons lay their
   snares wherever they are.

   In the next verse, he sets forth their cruelty in a light still more
   aggravated, by another comparison, saying, that they thirst for their
   prey like lions in their dens Now, it is a step higher in wickedness to
   equal in cruelty wild beasts than to make havoc after the manner of
   robbers. It is worthy of remark, that he always joins deceits and
   snares with violence, in order the better to show how miserable the
   children of God would be, unless they were succoured by help from
   heaven. There is also added another similitude, which expresses more
   clearly how craft in catching victims is mingled with cruelty. They
   catch them, says he but it is by drawing them into their net By these
   words he means, that they not only rush upon them with open force and
   violence, but that, at the same time also, they spread their nets in
   order to deceive.

   He again repeats all this in the tenth verse, giving a beautiful and
   graphic description of the very mien or gesture of such wicked men,
   just as if he set before our eyes a picture of them. They crouch low,
   says he, and cast themselves down, [220] that they may not, by their
   cruelty, frighten away their victims to a distance; for they would fain
   catch in their entanglements those whom they cannot hurt without coming
   close to them. We see how he joins these two things together, first
   snares or gins, and then sudden violence, as soon as the prey has
   fallen into their hands. For, by the second clause, he means, that
   whenever they see the simple to be fully in their power, they rush upon
   them by surprise with a savage violence, just as if a lion should
   furiously rise from his couch to tear in pieces his prey. [221] The
   obvious meaning of the Psalmist is, that the ungodly are to be dreaded
   on all sides, because they dissemble their cruelty, till they find
   those caught in their toils whom they wish to devour. There is some
   obscurity in the words, to which we shall briefly advert. In the clause
   which we have rendered an army of the afflicted, the Hebrew word
   chlk'ym, chelcaim, an army, in the opinion of some, is a word of four
   letters. [222] Those, however, think more accurately who hold it to be
   compound, and equivalent to two words. [223] Although, therefore, the
   verb nphl, naphal, is in the singular number, yet the prophet,
   doubtless, uses chl k'ym, chel caim, collectively, to denote a great
   company of people who are afflicted by every one of these lions. I have
   rendered tsvmym, atsumim, his strengths, as if it were a substantive;
   because the prophet, doubtless, by this term, intends the talons and
   teeth of the lion, in which the strength of that beast chiefly
   consists. As, however, the word is properly an adjective in the plural
   number, signifying strong, without having any substantive with which it
   agrees, we may reasonably suppose that, by the talons and teeth of the
   lion, he means to express metaphorically a powerful body of soldiers.
   In short, the meaning is this: These wicked men hide their strength, by
   feigned humility and crafty courteous demeanour, and yet they will
   always have in readiness an armed band of satellites, or claws and
   teeth, as soon as an opportunity of doing mischief is presented to
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [216] "Ou, par ses forts, asavoir membres." -- Fr. "Or, by his strong
   members." That is, his teeth, or claws. The adjective for strong, in
   the original, is in the plural, and there is no substantive with which
   it agrees. We have examples of a similar ellipsis in other parts of
   Scripture. Thus in 2 Samuel 21:16, we have new, for a new sword; and in
   Psalm 73:10, full, for a full cup; and in Matthew 10:42, cold, for cold
   water. -- Poole's Annotations.

   [217] Horsley renders the eighth verse thus: "He sitteth in ambush* in
   the villages in secret places;
   He murdereth the innocent;
   his eyes are ever watching for the helpless." And he has the following
   note: "Symmachus and St Jerome certainly read thus ysk m'rv vchtsrym,
   and they both render, h, as a participle. He sitteth prowling about the
   farm-houses.' This I take to be the true reading and the true
   rendering. The image is that of a beast of prey of the lesser order, a
   fox or a wolf, lying upon the watch about the farm-yard in the
   evening." *Or, "he sitteth prowling about the farmyard."

   [218] Bishop Mant reads "peering eyes." Concerning the word, says he,
   "which I have rendered peering, Parkhurst says that it is applied to
   winking or half closing the eyes in order to see more distinctly. The
   Septuagint and Vulgate translations, which mean look at, behold, give
   the general sense, but not the beautiful image expressed in the
   Hebrew."

   [219] "Qui sont parmi les bois." -- Fr

   [220] The allusion is to the practice of the lion, who, when he intends
   to seize upon his prey, crouches, or lies down, and gathers himself
   together, both to conceal himself, and that he may make the greater
   spring upon his prey when it comes within his reach, (Job 38:39, 40.)

   [221] "Comme si un lion sortant de son giste se levoit furieusement
   pour mettre sa proye par pieces." -- Fr. "As if a lion issuing from his
   den, furiously raised himself to spring upon his prey, and to tear it
   to pieces." "When the lion" says Buffon "leaps up on his prey, he gives
   a spring of ten or fifteen feet, falls on, seizes it with his
   fore-paws, tears it with his claws, and afterwards devours it with his
   teeth."

   [222] Being the plural of, chlkh, chelcah, which occurs three times in
   this psalm, namely, here and in the eighth and fourteenth verses, where
   it is rendered poor.

   [223] Namely, chl k'ym chel caim. Those who adopt this reading observe,
   that according to the other view, the verb nphl, naphal, translated may
   fall, which is singular, is joined with a plural noun, chlk'ym
   chelcaim, but that, by dividing this last word into two, we get a
   singular nominative to the verb. Hammond, however, who adopts the first
   opinion, observes, "That it is an elegance, both in the Hebrew and
   Arabic, to use the verb singular with the nominative plural, especially
   when the verb is placed first, as here it is;" and, therefore, he
   denies the validity of that objection against the ordinary rendering.

   Psalm 10:11-13

   11. He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten it: he hideth his
   face that he may never see it. 12. Arise, O Jehovah God, lift up thine
   hand: forget not the poor. 13. Why do the wicked despise God? He saith
   in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.


   11. He hath said in his heart. The Psalmist again points out the source
   from which the presumption of the ungodly proceeds. Because God seems
   to take no notice of their wicked practices, they flatter themselves
   with the hope of escaping unpunished. As, however, they do not openly
   utter with their mouth the detestable blasphemy, that God hath
   forgotten their conduct, and hath shut his eyes that he may never see
   it, but hide their thoughts in the deep recesses of their own hearts,
   as Isaiah declares, (Isaiah 29:15) the Psalmist uses the same form of
   expression which he used before, and which he repeats a little after
   the third time, namely, that the ungodly say to themselves, in their
   hearts, that God takes no concern whatever in the affairs of men. And
   it is to be observed, that the ungodly, when all things happen to them
   according to their wishes, form such a judgment of their prosperity as
   to persuade themselves that God is in a manner bound or obliged to
   them. [224] Whence it comes to pass, that they live in a state of
   constant security, [225] because they do not reflect, that after God
   has long exercised patience towards them, they will undergo a solemn
   reckoning, and that their condemnation will be the more terrible, the
   greater the long-suffering of God.

   12. Arise, O Jehovah. It is a disease under which men in general labor,
   to imagine, according to the judgment of the flesh, that when God does
   not execute his judgments, he is sitting idle, or lying at ease. There
   is, however, a great difference with respect to this between the
   faithful and the wicked. The latter cherish the false opinion which is
   dictated by the weakness of the flesh, and in order to soothe and
   flatter themselves in their vices, they indulge in slumbering, and
   render their conscience stupid, [226] until at length, through their
   wicked obstinacy, they harden themselves into a gross contempt of God.
   But the former soon shake from their minds that false imagination, and
   chastise themselves, returning of their own accord to a due
   consideration of what is the truth on this subject. [227] Of this we
   have here set before us a striking example. By speaking of God after
   the manner of men, the prophet declares that the same error which he
   has just now condemned in the despisers of God had gradually stolen in
   upon his own mind. But he proceeds at once to correct it, and
   resolutely struggles with himself, and restrains his mind from forming
   such conceptions of God, as would reflect dishonor upon his
   righteousness and glory. It is therefore a temptation to which all men
   are naturally prone, to begin to doubt of the providence of God, when
   his hand and judgment are not seen. The godly, however, differ widely
   from the wicked. The former, by means of faith, check this apprehension
   of the flesh; while the latter indulge themselves in their froward
   imagination. Thus David, by the word Arise, does not so much stir up
   God, as he awakens himself, or endeavors to awaken himself, to hope for
   more of the assistance of God than he presently experienced.
   Accordingly, this verse contains the useful doctrine, that the more the
   ungodly harden themselves, through their slothful ignorance, and
   endeavor to persuade themselves that God takes no concern about men and
   their affairs, and will not punish the wickedness which they commit,
   the more should we endeavor to be persuaded of the contrary; yes,
   rather their ungodliness ought to incite us vigorously to repel the
   doubts which they not only admit, but studiously frame for themselves.

   13. Why doth the wicked despise God? It is, indeed, superfluous to
   bring arguments before God, for the purpose of persuading him to grant
   us what we ask; but still he permits us to make use of them, and to
   speak to him in prayer, as familiarly as a son speaks to an earthly
   father. It should always be observed, that the use of praying is, that
   God may be the witness of all our affections; not that they would
   otherwise be hidden from him, but when we pour out our hearts before
   him, our cares are hereby greatly lightened, and our confidence of
   obtaining our requests increases. Thus David, in the present passage,
   by setting before himself how unreasonable and intolerable it would be
   for the wicked to be allowed to despise God according to their
   pleasure, thinking he will never bring them to an account, [228] was
   led to cherish the hope of deliverance from his calamities. The word
   which is here rendered despise, is the same as that which he had used
   before. Some translate it to provoke, and others to blaspheme. But the
   signification which I have preferred certainly agrees much better with
   the context; for when persons take from God the power and office of
   judging, this is ignominiously to drag him from his throne, and to
   degrade him, as it were, to the station of a private individual. [229]
   Moreover, as David had a little before complained that the ungodly deny
   the existence of a God, or else imagine him to be constantly asleep,
   having no care about mankind, so now he complains to the same purpose
   that they say, God will not require it.

   Psalm 10:14-15

   14. Thou hast seen it; for thou considerest mischief and vexation,
   [230] that thou mayest take the matter into thine own hand: upon thee
   shall the poor leave, for thou wilt be the helper of the fatherless.
   15. Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man; thou shalt seek
   his wickedness, and shalt not find it.


   14. Thou hast seen it; for thou, etc Here David, suddenly kindled with
   a holy zeal, enters into conflict, and, armed with the shield of faith,
   courageously repels these execrable opinions; but as he could derive no
   advantage by making his appeal to men, he has recourse to God, and
   addresses him. As the ungodly, in the hope of enjoying unrestrained
   license in the commission of all kinds of wickedness, withdraw to the
   greatest possible distance from God, [231] and through the dictates of
   a perverse mind, imagine themselves to be far beyond his reach; so, on
   the contrary, the faithful ought carefully to keep themselves aloof
   from those wild opinions, which are afloat in the world, and with minds
   lifted upward, to speak to God as if present with them. Accordingly,
   David, in order to prevent himself from being overcome by the
   blasphemies of men, very properly turns away his attention from them.
   There is added a reason in confirmation of the first sentence of the
   verse, namely, because God considers mischief and vexation Since it is
   the peculiar province of God to take cognisance of all wrongs, David
   concludes that it is impossible for God to shut his eyes when the
   ungodly are recklessly and without restraint committing their outrages.
   Moreover, he descends from the general to the particular, which ought
   to be attentively marked: for nothing is easier than to acknowledge in
   general terms that God exercises a care about the world, and the
   affairs of men; but it is very difficult to apply this doctrine to its
   various uses in every-day life. And yet, all that the Scripture says
   concerning the power and righteousness of God will be of no advantage
   to us, and, as it were, only matter of meagre speculation, [232] unless
   every one apply these statements to himself, as his necessity may
   require. Let us therefore learn, from the example of David, to reason
   thus: that, since it belongs to God to take notice of all the mischief
   and injuries which are inflicted on the good and simple, He considers
   our trouble and sorrows even when he seems for a time to take no notice
   of them. The Psalmist also adds, that God does not look down from
   heaven upon the conduct of men here below as an idle and unconcerned
   spectator, but that it is his work to pass judgment upon it; for to
   take the matter into his own hand, is nothing else than duly and
   effectually to examine and determine it as a judge.

   It is, however, our duty to wait patiently so long as vengeance is
   reserved in the hand of God, until he stretch forth his arm to help us.
   We see, therefore, the reason why it is immediately added, Upon thee
   shall the poor leave. By these words David means, that we ought to give
   the providence of God time to manifest itself. The godly, when they are
   afflicted, may with confidence cast their cares into his bosom, and
   commit themselves to his protection. They ought not, however, to be in
   haste for the accomplishment of their wishes; but, being now
   disburdened, they should take their breath till God manifestly declare
   that the fit time of interfering in their behalf is come. The man,
   therefore, leaves upon God who betakes himself to his protection, and
   who, fully persuaded of his faithfulness in keeping what is entrusted
   to him, quietly waits till the fit time of his deliverance come. Some
   read the verb passively, The poor shall be left upon thee. The first
   reading, however, is more correct, and it agrees with the rules of
   grammar; only it is a defective form of expression, inasmuch as the
   thing which the poor leaves is not expressed. But this defect is common
   in Hebrew; and there is no obscurity in the thing itself, namely, that,
   when the godly commit themselves and their concerns to God by prayer,
   their prayers will not be in vain; for these two clauses are closely
   connected, Upon thee shall the poor leave, and, Thou shalt be a helper
   to the fatherless By a metaphor he terms the person fatherless whom he
   had in the preceding clause called poor. And the verb being in the
   future tense denotes a continued act.

   15. Break thou the arm. This form of expression just means breaking the
   power of the wicked. And it is not simply a prayer; it may also be
   regarded as a prophecy. As the ungovernable fury of our enemies very
   often makes us lose courage, as if there were no means by which it
   could be restrained, David, in order to support his faith, and preserve
   it from failing through the fears which presented themselves, sets
   before himself the consideration, that whenever it shall please God to
   break the power of the ungodly, he will bring to nothing both
   themselves and all their schemes. To make the meaning the more evident,
   the sentence may be explained in this way, -- Lord, as soon as it shall
   seem good to thee to break the arm of the wicked, thou wilt destroy him
   in a moment, and bring to nought his powerful and violent efforts in
   the work of doing mischief. David, indeed, beseeches God to hasten his
   assistance and his vengeance; but, in the meantime, while these are
   withheld, he sustains himself by the consolatory reflection, that the
   ungodly cannot break forth into violence and mischief except in so far
   as God permits them; since it is in his power, whenever he ascends into
   the judgment-seat, to destroy them even with his look alone. And
   certainly, as the rising sun dissipates the clouds and vapours by his
   heat, and clears up the dark air, so God, when he stretches forth his
   hand to execute the office of a Judge, restores to tranquillity and
   order all the troubles and confusions of the world. The Psalmist calls
   the person of whom he speaks not only wicked, but the wicked and the
   evil man, and he does so, in my judgment, for the purpose of setting
   forth in a stronger light the greatness of the wickedness of the
   character which he describes. His words are as if he had said, Wicked
   men may even be frantic in their malice and impiety; but God can
   promptly and effectually remedy this evil whenever he pleases.

   Psalm 10:16-18

   16. Jehovah is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of
   his land. 17. Thou hast heard the desire of the needy, O Jehovah: thou,
   wilt direct [233] their hearts, and thine ear shall hear them. 18. To
   judge the fatherless and the poor, that the man who is of earth may no
   more terrify them.


   16. Jehovah is King for ever and ever. David now, as if he had obtained
   the desires of his heart, rises up to holy rejoicing and thanksgiving.
   When he calls God King for ever and ever, it is a token of his
   confidence and joy. By the title of King, he vindicates God's claim to
   the government of the world, and when he describes him as King for ever
   and ever, this shows how absurd it is to think to shut him up within
   the narrow limits of time. As the course of human life is short, even
   those who sway the scepter over the greatest empires, being but mortal
   men, very often disappoint the expectations of their servants, [234] as
   we are taught in Psalm 146:3, 4,

   "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is
   no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
   very day his thoughts perish."

   Often the power of giving assistance to others fails them, and while
   they are delaying to give it, the opportunity slips away from them. But
   we ought to entertain more exalted and honorable conceptions of our
   heavenly King; for although he does not immediately execute his
   judgments, yet he has always the full and the perfect power of doing
   so. In short, he reigns, not for himself in particular; it is for us
   that he reigns for ever and ever. As this, then, is the duration of his
   reign, it follows that a long delay cannot hinder him from stretching
   forth his hand in due season to succor his people, even when they are,
   as it were, dead, or in a condition which, to the eye of sense and
   reason, is hopeless. -- The heathen are perished out of the land The
   meaning is, that the holy land was at length purged from the
   abominations and impurities with which it had been polluted. It was a
   dreadful profanation, when the land which had been given for an
   inheritance to the people of God, and allotted to those who purely
   worshipped him, nourished ungodly and wicked inhabitants. By the
   heathen he does not mean foreigners, and such as did not belong to the
   race of Abraham according to the flesh, [235] but hypocrites, who
   falsely boasted that they belonged to the people of God, just as at
   this day many, who are Christians only in name, occupy a place in the
   bosom of the Church. It is no new thing for the prophets to call
   apostates, who have degenerated from the virtues and holy lives of
   their fathers, by the reproachful name of heathen, and to compare them
   not only to the uncircumcised, but also to the Canaanites, who were the
   most detestable among all the heathen.

   "Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite," (Ezekiel 16:3)

   Many other similar passages are to be met with in Scripture. David,
   therefore, in applying the dishonorable name of heathen to the false
   and bastard children of Abraham, gives God thanks for having expelled
   such a corrupt class out of his Church. By this example we are taught,
   that it is no new thing if we see in our own day the Church of God
   polluted by profane and irreligious men. We ought, however, to beseech
   God quickly to purge his house, and not leave his holy temple exposed
   to the desecration of swine and dogs, as if it were a dunghill.

   17. O Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the needy. In these words
   the prophet confirms what I have just now said, that when hypocrites
   prevail in the Church, or exceed the faithful in number, we ought,
   unceasingly, to beseech God to root them out; for such a confused and
   shameful state of things ought surely to be matter of deep grief to all
   the true servants of God. By these words, also, the Holy Spirit assures
   us, that what of old God granted to the fathers in answer to their
   prayers, we at the present day will obtain, provided we have that
   anxious solicitude about the deliverance of the Church which we ought
   to entertain. The clause which follows, Thou wilt direct their hearts,
   is variously interpreted by expositors. Some think it signifies the
   same thing, as if it had been said, Thou wilt give success to their
   desires. According to others, the meaning is, Thou wilt frame and
   sanctify their hearts by thy grace, that they may ask nothing in prayer
   but what is right and according to the divine will, as Paul teaches us
   that the Holy Spirit

   "stirs up within us groanings which cannot be uttered," (Romans 8:26)

   Both these expositions are perhaps too forced. David, in this clause,
   magnifies the grace of God in sustaining and comforting his servants in
   the midst of their troubles and distresses, that they may not sink into
   despondency, -- in furnishing them with fortitude and patience, - in
   inspiring them with good hope, - and in stirring them up also to
   prayer. This is the import of the verb kyn, Kin, which signifies not
   only to direct, but also to establish. It is a singular blessing which
   God confers upon us, when, in the midst of temptation, he upholds our
   hearts, and does not suffer them to recede from him, or to turn aside
   to any other quarter for support and deliverance. The meaning of the
   clause which immediately follows, Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear,
   is, that it is not in vain that God directs the hearts of his people,
   and leads them, in obedience to his command, to look to Himself, and to
   call upon him in hope and patience -- it is not in vain, because his
   ears are never shut against their groanings. Thus the mutual harmony
   between two religious exercises is here commended. God does not suffer
   the faith of his servants to faint or fail, nor does he suffer them to
   desist from praying; but he keeps them near him by faith and prayer,
   until it actually appear that their hope has been neither vain nor
   ineffectual. The sentence might, not improperly, be rendered thus: Thou
   shalt establish their heart, until thine ear hear them.

   18. That thou mayest judge. Here the Psalmist applies the last sentence
   of the preceding verse to a special purpose, namely, to prevent the
   faithful, when they are unjustly oppressed, from doubting that God will
   at length take vengeance on their enemies, and grant them deliverance.
   By these words he teaches us, that we ought to bear with patience and
   fortitude the crosses and afflictions which are laid upon us, since God
   often withholds assistance from his servants until they are reduced to
   extremity. This is, indeed, a duty of difficult performance, for we
   would all desire to be entirely exempted from trouble; and, therefore,
   if God does not quickly come to our relief, we think him remiss and
   inactive. But if we are anxiously desirous of obtaining his assistance,
   we must subdue our passion, restrain our impatience, and keep our
   sorrows within due bounds, waiting until our afflictions call forth the
   exercise of his compassion, and excite him to manifest his grace in
   succouring us.

   That the man who is of earth may no more terrify them. David again
   commends the power of God in destroying the ungodly; and he does it for
   this purpose, - that in the midst of their tumultuous assaults we may
   have this principle deeply fixed in our minds, that God, whenever he
   pleases, can bring all their attempts to nothing. Some understand the
   verb 'rph, arots, which we have translated to terrify, as neuter, and
   read the words thus, -- that mortal man may be no more afraid. But it
   agrees better with the scope of the passage to render it transitively,
   as we have done. And although the wicked prosper in their wicked
   course, and lift up their heads above the clouds, there is much truth
   in describing them as mortal, or men liable to many calamities. The
   design of the Psalmist is indirectly to condemn their infatuated
   presumption, in that, forgetful of their condition, they breathe out
   cruel and terrible threatenings, as if it were beyond the power of even
   God himself to repress the violence of their rage. The phrase, of
   earth, contains a tacit contrast between the low abode of this world
   and the height of heaven. For whence do they go forth to assault the
   children of God? Doubtless, from the earth, just as if so many worms
   should creep out of the crevices of the ground; but in so doing, they
   attack God himself, who promises help to his servants from heaven.

   PSALM 11.

   This psalm consists of two parts. In the first part, David recounts the
   severe assaults of temptation which he had encountered, and the state
   of distressing anxiety to which he had been reduced during the time of
   his persecution by Saul. In the second, he congratulates himself on the
   deliverance which God had granted him, and magnifies the righteousness
   of God in the government of the world.

   To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 11:1-3

   1. In Jehovah do I put my trust: how then say ye to my soul, Flee ye
   into your mountain as a bird? 2. Surely, behold! the ungodly shall bend
   [236] their bow, they have fixed their arrows upon the string, to shoot
   secretly at the upright in heart. 3. Truly, the foundations are
   destroyed: what [237] hath the righteous One done?


   1. In Jehovah do I put my trust. Almost all interpreters think that
   this is a complaint which David brings against his countrymen, that
   while seeking in every quarter for hiding-places, he could find nowhere
   even common humanity. And it is indeed true, that in the whole course
   of his wanderings, after betaking himself to flight to escape the
   cruelty of Saul, he could find no secure place of retreat, at least,
   none where he might continue for any length of time undisturbed. He
   might, therefore, justly complain of his own countrymen, in that none
   of them deigned to shelter him when he was a fugitive. But I think he
   has a respect to something higher. When all men were striving, as it
   were, with each other, to drive him to despair, he must, according to
   the weakness of the flesh, have been afflicted with great and almost
   overwhelming distress of mind; but fortified by faith, he confidently
   and steadfastly leaned on the promises of God, and was thus preserved
   from yielding to the temptations to which he was exposed. These
   spiritual conflicts, with which God exercised him in the midst of his
   extreme perils, he here recounts. Accordingly, as I have just now
   observed, the psalm should be divided into two parts. Before
   celebrating the righteousness of God, which he displays in the
   preservation of the godly, the Psalmist shows how he had encountered
   even death itself, and yet, through faith and an upright conscience,
   had obtained the victory. As all men advised him to leave his country,
   and retire into some place of exile, where he might be concealed,
   inasmuch as there remained for him no hope of life, unless he should
   relinquish the kingdom, which had been promised to him; in the
   beginning of the psalm, he opposes to this perverse advice the shield
   of his trust in God.

   But before entering farther upon the subject, let us interpret the
   words. The word nvd, nud, which we have rendered to flee, is written in
   the plural number, and yet it is read in the singular; [238] but, in my
   opinion, this is a corrupt reading. As David tells us that this was
   said to himself only, the Jewish doctors, thinking the plural number
   unsuitable, have taken it upon them to read the word in the singular.
   Some of them, wishing to retain the literal sense as it is called,
   perplex themselves with the question, why it is said, Flee ye, rather
   than Flee thou; and, at length, they have recourse to a very meagre
   subtilty, as if those who counselled him to betake himself to flight
   addressed both his soul and his body. But it was unnecessary labor to
   put themselves to so much trouble in a matter where there is no
   difficulty; for it is certain that those who counselled David did not
   say that he alone should flee, but that he should flee, together with
   all his attendants, who were in the same danger with himself. Although,
   therefore, they addressed themselves especially to David, yet they
   included his companions, who had a common cause with him, and were
   exposed to the like danger. Expositors, also, differ in their
   interpretation of what follows. Many render it from your mountain, as
   if it were mhrkm, meharkem; and, according to them, there is a change
   of person, because those who spoke to him must have said, flee thou
   from Our mountain. But this is harsh and strained. Nor does it appear
   to me that they have any more reason on their side, when they say that
   Judea is here called mountain. Others think we should read hr kmv
   tsphvr, har kemo tsippor, [239] that is, into the mountain as a bird,
   without a pronoun. [240] But if we follow what I have said, it will
   agree very well with the scope of the passage to read thus, Flee ye
   into your mountain, for you are not permitted to dwell in your own
   country. I do not, however, think that any particular mountain is
   pointed out, but that David was sent away to the desert rocks wherever
   chance might lead him. Condemning those who gave him this advice, he
   declares that he depends upon the promise of God, and is not at all
   disposed thus to go away into exile. Such, then, was the condition of
   David, that, in his extreme necessity, all men repelled and chased him
   far away into desert places.

   But as he seems to intimate that it would be a sign of distrust were he
   to place his safety in flight, it may be asked, whether or not it would
   have been lawful for him to flee; yea, we know that he was often forced
   to retire into exile, and driven about from place to place, and that he
   even sometimes hid himself in caves. I answer, it is true he was
   unsettled like a poor fearful bird, which leaps from branch to branch,
   [241] and was compelled to seek for different bypaths, and to wander
   from place to place to avoid the snares of his enemies; yet still his
   faith continued so steadfast that he never alienated himself from the
   people of God. Others accounted him a lost man, and one whose affairs
   were in a hopeless condition, setting no more value upon him than if he
   had been a rotten limb, [242] yet he never separated himself from the
   body of the Church. And certainly these words, Flee ye, tended only to
   make him yield to utter despair. But it would have been wrong for him
   to have yielded to these fears, and to have betaken himself to flight,
   as if uncertain of what would be the issue. He therefore says
   expressly, that this was spoken to his soul, meaning that his heart was
   deeply pierced by such an ignominious rejection, since he saw (as I
   have said) that it tended only to shake and to weaken his faith. In
   short, although he had always lived innocently, as it became a true
   servant of God, yet these malignant men would have doomed him to remain
   for ever in a state of exile from his native country. This verse
   teaches us, that however much the world may hate and persecute us,
   [243] we ought nevertheless to continue steadfast at our post, that we
   may not deprive ourselves of a right to lay claim to the promises of
   God, or that these may not slip away from us; and that, however much
   and however long we may be harassed, we ought always to continue firm
   and unwavering in the faith of our having the call of God.

   2. Surely, behold! the ungodly. Some think that this is added as the
   excuse made by those who desired David to save himself by flight.
   According to others, David expostulates with his countrymen, who saw
   death menacing him on all sides, and yet denied him shelter. But, in my
   judgment, he here continues his account of the trying circumstances in
   which he was placed. His design is not only to place before our view
   the dangers with which he was surrounded, but to show us that he was
   exposed even to death itself. He therefore says, that wherever he might
   hide himself, it was impossible for him to escape from the hands of his
   enemies. Now, the description of so miserable a condition illustrates
   the more strikingly the grace of God in the deliverance which he
   afterwards granted him. With respect to the words, they have fixed
   their arrows upon the string, to Shoot Secretly, or in darkness, some
   understand them metaphorically of the attempts which David's enemies
   made to surprise him by craft and snares. I, however, prefer this
   interpretation, as being more simple, - that there was no place so
   hidden into which the darts of his enemies did not penetrate, and that,
   therefore, to whatever caves he could betake himself for concealment
   and shelter, death would follow him as his inseparable attendant.

   3. Truly, the foundations are destroyed. Some translate the word hstvt,
   hashathoth, by nets, a sense in which the Scripture in other places
   often uses this word; and their explanation of the words is, that the
   wicked and deceitful arts which the ungodly practiced against David
   were defeated. If we admit this interpretation, the meaning of what he
   adds immediately after, What hath the righteous one done? will be, that
   his escape in safety was owing neither to his own exertion, nor to his
   own skill, but that, without putting forth any effort, and when, as it
   were, he was asleep, he had been delivered from the nets and snares of
   his enemies by the power of God. But the word foundations agrees better
   with the scope of the passage, for he evidently proceeds to relate into
   what straits he had been brought and shut up, so that his preservation
   was now to all appearance hopeless. Interpreters, however, who hold
   that foundations is the proper translation of the word, are not agreed
   as to the sense. Some explain it, that he had not a single spot on
   which to fix his foot; others, that covenants which ought to have
   stability, by being faithfully kept, had been often shamefully violated
   by Saul. Some also understand it allegorically, as meaning that the
   righteous priests of God, who were the pillars of the land, had been
   put to death. But I have no doubt of its being a metaphor taken from
   buildings, which must fall down and become a heap of ruins when their
   foundations are undermined; and thus David complains, that, in the eyes
   of the world, he was utterly overthrown, inasmuch as all that he
   possessed was completely destroyed. In the last clause, he again
   repeats, that to be persecuted so cruelly was what he did not deserve:
   What hath the righteous one done? And he asserts his own innocence,
   partly to comfort himself in his calamities from the testimony of a
   good conscience, and partly to encourage himself in the hope of
   obtaining deliverance. That which encouraged him to trust in God was
   the belief which he entertained, that on account of the justice of his
   cause God was on his side, and would be favorable to him.

   [236] "Ont tendu l'arc." -- Fr. "Have bent their bow."

   [237] "Mais que?" -- Fr. "But what?"

   [238] Calvin's meaning is, that according to the Hebrew letters, the
   verb is in the plural number; but according to the Hebrew punctuation,
   which regulates the reading, it is in the singular. Piscator, in his
   commentary on this passage, observes, nvdv, nudi, according to the
   points, is singular and feminine, and refers to the soul of David;
   according to the letters it is plural, nvdv, nudu, and refers to David
   and his associates. This last reading appears to me the most
   appropriate, both because it is followed by the relative in the plural
   number, and because it does not seem to be a proper or natural mode of
   expression, to speak of persons addressing the soul of another" The
   phrase, to my soul, however, may simply mean to me, a sense in which it
   is frequently used in Scripture.

   [239] This is the reading adopted by the Chaldee, Septuagint, and
   Vulgate versions. Hammond observes, that "where the Hebrew now reads,
   hrkm tsphvr, har kemo tsippor, To your mountain a sparrow, all the
   ancient interpreters uniformly read, To the mountain as a sparrow."
   Horsley translates the words, "Flee, sparrows, to your hill," and views
   the expression "as proverbial, denoting a situation of helplessness and
   danger, in which there was no hope of safety but in flight" The noun,
   tsphvr tsippor, which he renders sparrows, is singular, and it is here
   construed with a plural verb and a plural pronoun. But he remarks, that
   as this word, like most names of animals in the Hebrew language,
   signifies either the individual or the species, it may here be used in
   the singular number for many individuals, and construed with plural
   verbs, adjectives, and pronouns.

   Psalm 11:4-5

   4. Jehovah is in the palace of his holiness: Jehovah has his throne in
   heaven; his eyes behold, [244] and his eyelids consider the children of
   men. 5. Jehovah approves the righteous man; but his soul hateth the
   ungodly, and him who loveth iniquity.


   4. Jehovah is in the palace of his holiness. In what follows, the
   Psalmist glories in the assurance of the favor of God, of which I have
   spoken. Being destitute of human aid, he betakes himself to the
   providence of God. It is a signal proof of faith, as I have observed
   elsewhere, to take and to borrow, so to speak, [245] light from heaven
   to guide us to the hope of salvation, when we are surrounded in this
   world with darkness on every side. All men acknowledge that the world
   is governed by the providence of God; but when there comes some sad
   confusion of things, which disturbs their ease, and involves them in
   difficulty, there are few who retain in their minds the firm persuasion
   of this truth. But from the example of David, we ought to make such
   account of the providence of God as to hope for a remedy from his
   judgment, even when matters are in the most desperate condition. There
   is in the words an implied contrast between heaven and earth; for if
   David's attention had been fixed on the state of things in this world,
   as they appeared to the eye of sense and reason, he would have seen no
   prospect of deliverance from his present perilous circumstances. But
   this was not David's exercise; on the contrary, when in the world all
   justice lies trodden under foot, and faithfulness has perished, he
   reflects that God sits in heaven perfect and unchanged, from whom it
   became him to look for the restoration of order from this state of
   miserable confusion. He does not simply say that God dwells in heaven;
   but that he reigns there, as it were, in a royal palace, and has his
   throne of judgment there. Nor do we indeed render to him the honor
   which is his due, unless we are fully persuaded that his judgment-seat
   is a sacred sanctuary for all who are in affliction and unrighteously
   oppressed. When, therefore, deceit, craft, treachery, cruelty,
   violence, and extortion, reign in the world; in short, when all things
   are thrown into disorder and darkness by injustice and wickedness, let
   faith serve as a lamp to enable us to behold God's heavenly throne, and
   let that sight suffice to make us wait in patience for the restoration
   of things to a better state. The temple of his holiness, or his holy
   temple, which is commonly taken for Sion, doubtless here signifies
   heaven; and that it does so is clearly shown by the repetition in the
   next clause, Jehovah has his throne in Heaven; for it is certain David
   expresses the same thing twice.

   His eyes behold. Here he infers, from the preceding sentence, that
   nothing is hidden from God, and that, therefore, men will be obliged to
   render up to him an account of all that they have done. If God reigns
   in heaven, and if his throne is erected there, it follows that he must
   necessarily attend to the affairs of men, in order one day to sit in
   judgment upon them. Epicurus, and such like him as would persuade
   themselves that God is idle, and indulges in repose in heaven, may be
   said rather to spread for him a couch on which to sleep than to erect
   for him a throne of judgment. But it is the glory of our faith that
   God, the Creator of the world, does not disregard or abandon the order
   which he himself at first established. And when he suspends his
   judgments for a time, it becomes us to lean upon this one truth that he
   beholds from heaven; just as we now see David contenting himself with
   this consolatory consideration alone, that God rules over mankind, and
   observes whatever is transacted in the world, although his knowledge,
   and the exercise of his jurisdiction, are not at first sight apparent.
   This truth is still more clearly explained in what is immediately added
   in the fifth verse, that God distinguishes between the righteous and
   the unrighteous, and in such a way as shows that he is not an idle
   spectator; for he is said to approve the righteous, and to hate the
   wicked The Hebrew word vchn, bachan, which we have rendered to approve,
   often signifies to examine or try. But in this passage I explain it as
   simply meaning, that God so inquires into the cause of every man as to
   distinguish the righteous from the wicked. It is farther declared, that
   God hates those who are set upon the infliction of injuries, and upon
   doing mischief. As he has ordained mutual intercourse between men, so
   he would have us to maintain it inviolable. In order, therefore, to
   preserve this his own sacred and appointed order, he must be the enemy
   of the wicked, who wrong and are troublesome to others. There is also
   here contrasted God's hatred of the wicked, and wicked men's love of
   iniquity, to teach us that those who please and flatter themselves in
   their mischievous practices gain nothing by such flatteries, and only
   deceive themselves.

   Psalm 11:6-7

   6. He will rain upon the ungodly snares, fire and brimstone, and a
   storm of whirlwinds: this is the portion of their cup. 7. For the
   righteous Jehovah loveth righteousness; [246] his countenance approveth
   the upright. [247]


   6. He will rain upon the ungodly. David now, in the last place, lays it
   down as a certain truth, that although God, for a time, may be still
   and delay his judgments, yet the hour of vengeance will assuredly come.
   Thus we see how by degrees he rises up to the hope of a happy issue to
   his present affliction, and he uses his efforts to attain this, that
   the social and moral disorder, which he saw prevailing around him,
   might not weaken his faith. As the tribunal of God remains firm and
   immovable, he, in the first place, sustains and comforts himself from
   the consideration, that God from on high beholds all that is done here
   below. In the next place, he considers what the office of judge
   requires, from which he concludes, that the actions of men cannot
   escape the inspection of God's omniscient eye, and that although he
   does not immediately punish their evil deeds, he hates all the wicked.
   Finally, he adds, that since God is armed with power, this hatred will
   not be in vain or ineffectual. Thus while God defers the infliction of
   punishment, the knowledge of his justice will have a powerful influence
   in maintaining our faith, until he actually show that he has never
   departed from his watch-tower, from which he beholds the actions of
   men. [248] He appropriately compares the punishments which God inflicts
   to rain. As rain is not constant, but the Lord sends it forth when he
   pleases; and, when the weather is calmest and most serene, suddenly
   raises a storm of hail or violent showers of rain; in like manner, it
   is here intimated that the vengeance which will be inflicted on the
   wicked will come suddenly, so that, when they shall be indulging in
   mirth, and intoxicated with their pleasures, and "when they shall say,
   Peace and safety, sudden destruction will come upon them." [249] At the
   same time, David here evidently alludes to the destruction of Sodom and
   Gomorrah. As the prophets, when they would promise the grace of God to
   the elect, remind them of the deliverance from Egypt, which God wrought
   in behalf of his ancient people, so when they would alarm the wicked,
   they threaten them with a destruction like that which befell Sodom and
   Gomorrah, and they do so upon good grounds; since Jude, in his Epistle,
   tells us that these cities "are set forth for an example, suffering the
   vengeance of eternal fire," (Jude 1:7) The Psalmist, with much beauty
   and propriety, puts snares [250] before fire and brimstone. We see that
   the ungodly, while God spares them, fear nothing, but give themselves
   ample scope in their wayward courses, like horses let loose [251] in an
   open field; and then, if they see any adversity impending over them,
   they devise for themselves ways of escape; in short, they continually
   mock God, as if they could not be caught, unless he first entangle and
   hold them fast in his snares. God, therefore, begins his vengeance by
   snares, shutting up against the wicked every way of escape; and when he
   has them entangled and bound, he thunders upon them dreadfully and
   horribly, like as he consumed Sodom and the neighboring cities with
   fire from heaven. The word zlphvt, zilaphoth, which we have rendered
   whirlwinds, is by some translated kindlings or burnings; and by others,
   commotions or terrors. [252] But the context requires the
   interpretation which I have brought forward; for a tempest is raised by
   stormy winds, and then follow thunder and lightning.

   The portion of their cup. By this expression he testifies that the
   judgments of God will certainly take effect, although ungodly men may
   delude themselves by deceitful flattery. This metaphor is frequently to
   be met with in the Scriptures. As the carnal mind believes nothing with
   greater difficulty than that the calamities and miseries which seem to
   be fortuitous, happen according to a just distribution from God, he
   represents himself under the character of a householder, who
   distributes to each member his portion or allowance. David, therefore,
   here intimates that there is certainly a reward laid up for the
   ungodly; that it will be in vain for them to resist, when the Lord
   shall reach to them the cup of his wrath to drink; and that the cup
   prepared for them is not such as they may sip drop by drop, but a cup,
   the whole of which they will be compelled to drink, as the prophet
   threatens,

   (Ezekiel 23:34) "Thou shalt drink it off even to the dregs."

   7. For the righteous Jehovah loveth righteousness. The Psalmist has
   just now reasoned from the office of God that he will punish the
   wicked, and now, from the nature of God, he concludes, that he will be
   the defender of the good and the upright. As he is righteous, David
   shows that, as the consequence of this, he must love righteousness, for
   otherwise he would deny himself. Besides, it would be a cold
   speculation to conceive of righteousness as inherent in God, unless, at
   the same time, we could come to the settled conclusion that God
   graciously owns whatever is his own, and furnishes evidence of this in
   the government of the world. Some think that the abstract term
   righteousness is put for righteous persons. But, in my opinion, the
   literal sense is here more suitable, namely, that righteousness is well
   pleasing to God, and that, therefore, he favors good causes. From this
   the Psalmist concludes, that the upright are the objects of his regard:
   His countenance approveth the upright He had said a little before in a
   different sense, that God beholds the children of men, meaning that he
   will judge the life of every man; but here he means that God graciously
   exercises a special care over the upright and the sincere, takes them
   under his protection, and keeps them in perfect safety. This conclusion
   of the psalm sufficiently shows, that the scope of the whole of it was
   to make it manifest that all those who, depending upon the grace of
   God, sincerely follow after righteousness, shall be safe under his
   protection. The Psalmist himself was one of this number and, indeed,
   the very chief of them. This last clause, His countenance approveth the
   upright, is, indeed, variously explained; but the true meaning, I have
   no doubt, is, that God has always a regard for the upright, and never
   turns away his eyes from them. It is a strained interpretation to view
   the words as meaning that the upright shall behold the face of God. But
   I will not stop to refute the opinions of other men.

   [250] Horsley reads, "glowing embers." Lowth renders the word "live
   coals," and observes, that phtym, pachim, means globes of fire, or
   simply the lightning. "This," says he, "is certainly more agreeable to
   the context than snares. The root is puach, which, though it sometimes
   means to ensnare, yet more frequently means to breathe forth, or emit,
   fire, for instance. Ezekiel 21:31, In the fire of my wrath I will blow
   upon thee.' The Ammonites are spoken of as thrown into the furnace of
   the divine wrath: compare Ezekiel 22:21, where almost the same words
   occur, except that the corresponding (and in this case synonymous) verb
   apach is made use of, whence mapnach, a bellows, Jeremiah 6:29. In the
   same sense the verb puach is introduced, Proverbs 29:8, Scorners will
   inflame a city.' From this explication of the root puach, the word
   pach, a coal blown up, is rightly derived." -- Sacred Poetry of the
   Hebrews, volume. 1, pp. 194, 195. Lowth also states, that the Orientals
   sometimes call the lightning snares or chains, probably from the
   continual coruscations of the lightning in its passage through the air,
   which seem to be connected with each other like a chain. Hengstenberg,
   however, opposes this exposition, and adopts and defends that which
   Calvin has given. "phchym," says he, "must here, according to most
   expositors, be taken as a figurative designation of lightning, which is
   alleged to be called also by the Arabians, in prose and poetry, by the
   name of chains. But it is a sufficient objection to this meaning, that
   phch does not signify cord, in general, but specially, gin, snare,
   trap." In proof of this, he quotes Psalm 9:15; Job 18:9; 22:10; Isaiah
   24:17, 18; Proverbs 22:5. "The expression, that he will rain," says he,
   "can present no proper difficulty, as it simply points to the fullness
   of God's retributive judgments, noticed already by Luther, when he
   says, that by it the prophet indicates the great variety and multitude
   of the evils threatened."

   [251] "Ainsi que des chevaux desbridez." -- Fr.

   [252] Dr Adam Clarke renders the words rvh zlphvt, ruach zilaphoth,
   "the spirit of terrors," and states, that "this may refer to the
   horribly suffocat ing Arabian wind called Sinurn." Bishop Lowth
   translates the words, "a burning storm," upon which Michaelis observes,
   "This is an admirable image, and is taken from the school of nature.
   The wind zilgaphoth, which blows from the east, is very pestilential,
   and, therefore, almost proverbial among the Orientals Many wonderful
   stories are related of its effects by the Arabians, and their poets
   feign that the wicked, in their place of eternal torment, are to
   breathe this pestiferous wind as their vital air." -- Lowth's Sacred
   Poetry, vol. 1, p. 193. Hengstenberg translates the words wrath-wind,
   and explains them as simply meaning the divine anger which breaks forth
   as a tempest; and observes, that the vehemence of the anger is denoted
   by the plural number. In opposition to the rendering burning wind, and
   to the opinion that there is an allusion to the Arabian Samurn, he
   states, "The root, zph has, in Hebrew, the signification of being
   angry, no other; and that of being hot, is not once to be found in the
   dialects."

   PSALM 12.

   David, deploring the wretched and forlorn condition of his people, and
   the utter overthrow of good order, beseeches God to afford them speedy
   relief. Then, in order to comfort both himself and all the godly, after
   having mentioned God's promise of assisting his people, he magnifies
   his faithfulness and constancy in performing his promises. From this he
   concludes, that at length God will deliver the godly, even when the
   world may be in a state of the greatest corruption. [253]

   To the chief musician upon the eighth. A song of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 12:1-2

   1. Save me, O Jehovah; for the merciful man hath failed, and the
   faithful are wasted away from among the children of men, 2. Every one
   speaketh deceit [or falsehood] with his neighbor; they speak with lips
   of flattery, with a double heart. [254]


   To the chief musician upon the eighth. With respect to the word eighth,
   there are two opinions among interpreters. According to some, it means
   a musical instrument; while others are rather inclined to think that it
   is a tune. But as it is of no great importance which of these opinions
   is adopted, I do not trouble myself much about this matter. The
   conjecture of some, that it was the beginning of a song, does not seem
   to me to be so probable as that it refers to the tune, and was intended
   to point out how the psalm was to be sung. [255] In the commencement
   David complains that the land was so overspread with wicked men, and
   persons who had broken forth into the commission of every kind of
   wickedness, that the practice of righteousness and justice had ceased,
   and none was found to defend the cause of the good; in short, that
   there remained no longer either humanity or faithfulness. It is
   probable that the Psalmist here speaks of the time when Saul persecuted
   him, because then all, from the highest to the lowest, had conspired to
   destroy an innocent and an afflicted man. It is a thing very
   distressing to relate, and yet it was perfectly true, that
   righteousness was so utterly overthrown among the chosen people of God,
   that all of them, with one consent, from their hostility to a good and
   just cause, had broken forth into acts of outrage and cruelty. David
   does not here accuse strangers or foreigners, but informs us that this
   deluge of iniquity prevailed in the Church of God. Let the faithful,
   therefore in our day, not be unduly discouraged at the melancholy sight
   of a very corrupt and confused state of the world; but let them
   consider that they ought to bear it patiently, seeing their condition
   is just like that of David in time past. And it is to be observed,
   that, when David calls upon God for succor, he encourages himself in
   the hope of obtaining it from this, that there was no uprightness among
   men; so that from his example we may learn to betake ourselves to God
   when we see nothing around us but black despair. We ought to be fully
   persuaded of this, that the greater the confusion of things in the
   world is, God is so much the readier to aid and succor his people,
   [256] and that it is then the most proper season for him to interpose
   his assistance.

   1. The merciful man hath failed. Some think that this is a complaint
   that the righteous had been unjustly put to death; as if the Psalmist
   had said, Saul has cruelly cut off all who observed justice and
   faithfulness. But I would understand the words in a simpler sense, as
   meaning that there is no longer any beneficence or truth remaining
   among men. He has expressed in these two words in what true
   righteousness consists. As there are two kinds of unrighteousness,
   violence and deceit; so men live righteously when, in their intercourse
   with each other, they conscientiously abstain from doing any wrong or
   injury to one another, and cultivate peace and mutual friendship; when
   they are neither lions nor foxes. When, however, we see the world in
   such a state of disorder as is here described, and are afflicted
   thereby, we ought to be careful not to howl with the wolves, nor to
   suffer ourselves to be carried away with the dissipation and
   overflowing flood of iniquity which we see prevailing around us, but
   should rather imitate the example of David.

   2. Every man speaketh deceit. David in this verse sets forth that part
   of unrighteousness which is contrary to truth. He says that there is no
   sincerity or uprightness in their speech, because the great object upon
   which they are bent is to deceive. He next describes the manner in
   which they deceive, namely, that every man endeavors to ensnare his
   neighbor by flattery [257] He also points out the fountain and first
   cause of this, They speak with a double heart. This doubleness of
   heart, as I may term it, makes men double and variable in their speech,
   in order thereby to disguise themselves in different ways, [258] or to
   make themselves appear to others different from what they really are.
   Hence the Hebrew word chlqvt, chalakoth, which denotes flattery, is
   derived from a word which signifies division. As those who are resolved
   to act truthfully in their intercourse with their neighbors, freely and
   ingenuously lay open their whole heart; so treacherous and deceitful
   persons keep a part of their feeling hidden within their own breasts,
   and cover it with the varnish of hypocrisy and a fair outside; so that
   from their speech we cannot gather any thing certain with respect to
   their intentions. Our speech, therefore, must be sincere in order that
   it may be as it were a mirror, in which the uprightness of our heart
   may be beheld.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [254] Calvin's words literally rendered are, with a heart and a heart,
   and this is a very literal translation of the Hebrew words vlv vlv,
   be-leb va-leb. On the margin of the French version, he reads, "De coeur
   double," "with a double heart," which explains the meaning of the other
   phrase. "With a heart and a heart," is a form of expression which
   forcibly describes the character of deceitful men. "They seem to have
   two hearts," says Dr Adam Clarke, "one to speak fair words, and the
   other to invent mischief."

   Psalm 12:3-4

   3. Let Jehovah cut off all flattering tips, and the tongue that
   speaketh great [or proud] things: 4. Those who have said we will be
   strengthened by our tongues; our lips are in our own power: who is lord
   over us?


   To his complaint in the preceding verse he now subjoins an imprecation,
   that God would cut off deceitful tongues. It is uncertain whether he
   wishes that deceitful men may be utterly destroyed, or only that the
   means of doing mischief may be taken from them; but the scope of the
   passage leads us rather to adopt the first sense, and to view David as
   desiring that God, by some means or other, would remove that plague out
   of the way. As he makes no mention of malice, while he inveighs so
   vehemently against their envenomed tongues, we hence conclude, that he
   had suffered much more injury from the latter than from the former; and
   certainly falsehood and calumnies are more deadly than swords and all
   other kind of weapons. From the second clause of the third verse it
   appears more clearly what kind of flatterers they were of whom mention
   was made in the preceding verse: The tongue that speaketh great or
   proud things. Some flatter in a slavish and fulsome manner, declaring
   that they are ready to do and suffer any thing which they possibly can
   for our benefit. But David here speaks of another kind of flatterers,
   namely, those who in flattering proudly boast of what they will
   accomplish, and mingle base effrontery and threatening with their
   deceitful arts. He does not, therefore, speak of the herd of mean
   conceited persons among the common people who make a trade of
   flattering, that they may live at other people's expense; [259] but he
   points his imprecation against the great calumniators of the court to
   which he was attached, [260] who not only insinuated themselves by
   gentle arts, but also lied designedly in boasting of themselves, and in
   the big and haughty discourse with which they overwhelmed the poor and
   simple. [261]

   This the Psalmist confirms more fully in the following verse: Who have
   said, we will be strengthened by our tongues Those must be possessed of
   great authority who think that, in the very falsehood to which they are
   addicted, they have enough of strength to accomplish their purposes,
   and to protect themselves. It is the utmost height of wickedness for
   persons to break out into such presumption, that they scruple not to
   overthrow all law and equity by their arrogant and boasting language;
   for, in doing this, it is just as if they openly declared war against
   God himself. Some read, we will strengthen our tongues. This reading is
   passable, in so far as the sense is concerned, but it scarcely agrees
   with the rules of grammar, because the letter l, lamed, is added.
   Moreover, the sense which is more suitable is this: that the wicked
   persons spoken of being armed with their tongues, go beyond all bounds,
   and think they can accomplish by this means whatever they please; just
   as this set of men so deform every thing with their calumnies, that
   they would almost cover the sun himself with darkness.

   partly at Doeg, and such like courtiers; partly at the Ziphires, and
   such perfidious people in the country, who, promising him their

   betrayed him unto Saul, his declared enemy." -- Bishop Patrick's

   Psalm 12:5-6

   5. Because of the spoiling [262] of the needy, because of the groaning
   of the poor, I will now arise, Jehovah will say; I will set in safety
   him whom he snareth. [263] 6. The words of Jehovah are pure words:
   silver melted in an excellent crucible of earth, purified seven times.


   5. Because of the spoiling of the needy. David now sets before himself
   as matter of consolation, the truth that God will not suffer the wicked
   thus to make havoc without end and measure. The more effectually to
   establish himself and others in the belief of this truth, he introduces
   God himself as speaking. The expression is more emphatic when God is
   represented as coming forward and declaring with his own mouth that he
   is come to deliver the poor and distressed. There is also great
   emphasis in the adverb now, by which God intimates that, although our
   safety is in his hand, and, therefore, in secure keeping, yet he does
   not immediately grant deliverance from affliction; for his words imply
   that he had hitherto been, as it were, lying still and asleep, until he
   was awakened by the calamities and the cries of his people. When,
   therefore, the injuries, the extortions, and the devastations of our
   enemies leave us nothing but tears and groans, let us remember that now
   the time is at hand when God intends to rise up to execute judgment.
   This doctrine should also serve to produce in us patience, and prevent
   us from taking it ill, that we are reckoned among the number of the
   poor and afflicted, whose cause God promises to take into his own hand.

   With respect to the meaning of the second clause of the verse,
   expositors differ. According to some, to set in safety, means the same
   thing as to give or bring safety, as if the letter v, beth, which
   signifies in, were superfluous. But the language rather contains a
   promise to grant to those who are unjustly oppressed, full restitution.
   What follows is attended with more difficulty. The word phvh, phuach,
   which we have rendered to lay snares for, sometimes signifies to blow
   out, or to puff, -- at other times to ensnare, or to lay snares for;
   and sometimes, also, to speak. Those who think it is here put for to
   speak also differ among themselves with respect to the meaning. Some
   render it God will speak to himself; that is to say, God will determine
   with himself; but as the Psalmist had already declared the
   determination of God, this would be an unnecessary and vain repetition.
   Others refer it to the language of the godly, as if David introduced
   them speaking one to another concerning the faithfulness and stability
   of the promises of God; for with this word they connect the following
   sentence, The words of the Lord are pure words, etc But this view is
   even more strained than the preceding. The opinion of others, who
   suppose, that to the determination of God to arise, there is subjoined
   the language which is addressed to the godly, is more admissible. It
   would not be sufficient for God to determine with himself what he would
   do for our safety, if he did not speak to us expressly, and by name. It
   is only when God makes us to understand, by his own voice, that he will
   be gracious to us, that we can entertain the hope of salvation. God, it
   is true, speaks also to unbelievers, but without producing any good
   effect, seeing they are deaf; just as when he treats them with
   gentleness and liberality, it is without effect, because they are
   stupid, and devour his benefits without any sense of their coming from
   him. But as I perceive that under the word y'mr, yomar, will say, the
   promises of God may be suitably and properly comprehended, to avoid a
   repetition of the same thing, I adopt without hesitation the sense of
   the last clause, which I have given in the translation, namely, that
   God declares he will arise to restore to safety those who seem on all
   sides to be environed by the snares of their enemies, and even caught
   in them. The import of the language is this: The ungodly may hold the
   poor and afflicted entangled in their snares as a prey which they have
   caught; but I will set them in safety. If it should be replied, that
   the reading in the Hebrew is not for whom, but for him, I would
   observe, that it is no new thing for these words, him, for him, to be
   used instead of whom and for whom. [264] If any one prefer the sense of
   puffing at, I am not disposed greatly to oppose him. According to this
   reading, David would elegantly taunt the pride of the ungodly, who
   confidently imagine they can do any thing, [265] even with their
   breath, as we have seen in the tenth psalm, at the fifth verse.

   6. The words of Jehovah. The Psalmist now declares, that God is sure,
   faithful, and steadfast in his promises. But the insertion by the way
   of this commendation of the word of God would be to no purpose, if he
   had not first called himself, and other believers, to meditate on God's
   promises in their afflictions. Accordingly, the order of the Psalmist
   is to be attended to, namely, that, after telling us how God gives to
   his servants the hope of speedy deliverance, even in their deepest
   distresses, he now adds, to support their faith and hope, that God
   promises nothing in vain, or for the purpose of disappointing man.
   This, at first sight, seems a matter of small importance; but if any
   person consider more closely and attentively how prone the minds of men
   are to distrust and ungodly doubtings, he will easily perceive how
   requisite it is for our faith to be supported by this assurance, that
   God is not deceitful, that he does not delude or beguile us with empty
   words, and that he does not magnify beyond all measure either his power
   or his goodness, but that whatever he promises in word he will perform
   in deed. There is no man, it is true, who will not frankly confess that
   he entertains the same conviction which David here records, that the
   words of Jehovah are pure; but those who while lying in the shade and
   living at their ease liberally extol by their praises the truth of
   God's word, when they come to struggle with adversity in good earnest,
   although they may not venture openly to pour forth blasphemies against
   God, often charge him with not keeping his word. Whenever he delays his
   assistance, we call in question his fidelity to his promises and murmur
   just as if he had deceived us. There is no truth which is more
   generally received among men than that God is true; but there are few
   who frankly give him credit for this when they are in adversity. It is,
   therefore, highly necessary for us to cut off the occasion of our
   distrust; and whenever any doubt respecting the faithfulness of God's
   promises steals in upon us, we ought immediately to lift up against it
   this shield, that the words of the Lord are pure. The similitude of
   silver, which the Psalmist subjoins, is indeed far below the dignity
   and excellence of so great a subject; but it is very well adapted to
   the measure of our limited and imperfect understanding. Silver, if
   thoroughly refined, is valued at a high price amongst us. But we are
   far from manifesting for the word of God, the price of which is
   inestimable, an equal regard; and its purity is of less account with us
   than that of a corruptible metal. Yea, a great many coin mere dross in
   their own brain, by which to efface or obscure the brightness which
   shines in the word of God. The word vlyl, baälil, which we have
   translated crucible, is interpreted by many prince, or lord, as if it
   were a simple word. According to them, the meaning would be, that the
   word of God is like the purest silver, from which the dross has been
   completely removed with the greatest art and care, not for common use,
   but for the service of a great lord or prince of some country. I,
   however, rather agree with others who consider that vlyl, baälil, is a
   word compounded of the letter v, beth, which signifies in, and the noun
   lyl, alil, which signifies a clean or well polished vessel or crucible.

   Psalm 12:7-8

   7. Thou, O Jehovah, wilt keep them; thou wilt preserve him from this
   generation for ever. 8. The ungodly walk about on every side; when they
   are exalted, there is reproach to the children of men.


   7. Thou, O Jehovah. Some think that the language of the Psalmist here
   is that of renewed prayer; and they, therefore, understand the words as
   expressive of his desire, and translate them in the optative mood,
   thus, Do thou, O Jehovah, keep them [266] But I am rather of opinion
   that David, animated with holy confidence, boasts of the certain safety
   of all the godly, of whom God, who neither can deceive nor lie, avows
   himself to be the guardian. At the same time, I do not altogether
   disapprove of the interpretation which views David as renewing his
   supplications at the throne of grace. Some give this exposition of the
   passage, Thou wilt keep them, namely, thy words; [267] but this does
   not seem to me to be suitable. [268] David, I have no doubt, returns to
   speak of the poor, of whom he had spoken in the preceding part of the
   psalm. With respect to his changing the number, (for, he says first,
   Thou wilt keep them, and, next, Thou wilt preserve him [269] it is a
   thing quite common in Hebrew, and the sense is not thereby rendered
   ambiguous. These two sentences, therefore, Thou wilt keep them, and
   Thou wilt preserve him, signify the same thing, unless, perhaps, we may
   say that, in the second, under the person of one man, the Psalmist
   intends to point out the small number of good men. To suppose this is
   not unreasonable or improbable; and, according to this view, the import
   of his language is, Although only one good man should be left alive in
   the world, yet he would be kept in perfect safety by the grace and
   protection of God. But as the Jews, when they speak generally, often
   change the number, I leave my readers freely to form their own
   judgment. This, indeed, cannot be controverted, that by the word
   generation, or race, is denoted a great multitude of ungodly persons,
   and almost the whole body of the people. As the Hebrew word dvr, dor,
   signifies as well the men who live in the same age, as the space of
   time itself, David, without doubt, here means that the servants of God
   cannot escape, and continue safe, unless God defend them against the
   malice of the whole people, and deliver them from the wicked and
   perverse men of the age in which they live. Whence we learn that the
   world, at that time, was so corrupt, that David, by way of reproach,
   puts them all, as it were, into one bundle. Moreover, it is of
   importance again to remember what we have already stated, that he does
   not here speak of foreign nations, but of the Israelites, and God's
   chosen people. It is well to mark this carefully, that we may not be
   discouraged by the vast multitude of the ungodly, if we should
   sometimes see an immense heap of chaff upon the barn-floor of the Lord,
   while only a few grains of corn lie hidden underneath. And then,
   however small may be the number of the good, let this persuasion be
   deeply fixed in our minds, that God will be their protector, and that
   for ever. The word lvlm, leolam, which signifies for ever, is added,
   that we may learn to extend our confidence in God far into the future,
   seeing he commands us to hope for succor from him, not only once, or
   for one day, but as long as the wickedness of our enemies continues its
   work of mischief. We are, however, from this passage, at the same time,
   admonished that war is not prepared against us for a short time only,
   but that we must daily engage in the conflict. And if the guardianship
   which God exercises over the faithful is sometimes hidden, and is not
   manifest in its effects, let them wait in patience until he arise; and
   the greater the flood of calamities which overflows them, let them keep
   themselves so much the more in the exercise of godly fear and
   solicitude.

   8. The ungodly walk about on every side. The Hebrew word svyv, sabib,
   which we have translated on every side, signifies a circuit, or a going
   round; and, therefore, some explain it allegorically thus: the ungodly
   seize upon all the defiles or narrow parts of roads, in order to shut
   up or besiege the good on all sides; and others expound it even more
   ingeniously, thus: that they lay snares by indirect means, and by
   inventions full of art and deception. But I think the simple meaning
   is, that they possess the whole land, and range about through every
   part of it; as if the Psalmist had said, Wherever I turn my eyes, I see
   troops of them on every side. In the next clause he complains that
   mankind are shamefully and basely oppressed by their tyranny. This is
   the meaning, provided the clause is read as a distinct one by itself,
   separate from the preceding, a point about which interpreters differ,
   although this view seems to come nearer to the mind of the inspired
   writer. Some render the verse in one continuous sentence, thus: The
   ungodly fly about every where, when the reproaches among the children
   of men (that is to say, when the worthless and the refuse of men) are
   exalted, an exposition which is not unsuitable. It commonly happens,
   that as diseases flow from the head into the members, so corruptions
   proceed from princes, and infect the whole people. As, however, the
   former exposition is more generally received, and the most learned
   grammarians tell us that the Hebrew word zlvt, zuluth, which we have
   translated reproach, is a noun of the singular number, I have adopted
   the former exposition, not that I am dissatisfied with the latter, but
   because we must needs choose the one or the other.

   PSALM 13.

   The subject of this psalm is almost the same as that of the preceding.
   David, being afflicted, not only with the deepest distress, but also
   feeling himself, as it were, overwhelmed by a long succession of
   calamities and multiplied afflictions, implores the aid and succor of
   God, the only remedy which remained for him; and, in the close, taking
   courage, he entertains the assured hope of life from the promise of
   God, even amidst the terrors of death.

   Psalm 13:1-2

   1. How long, O Jehovah, wilt thou forget me, for ever? How long wilt
   thou hide thy face from me? 2. How long shall I take counsel in my
   soul? and have sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be
   exalted over me?


   1. How long, O Jehovah. It is very true that David was so greatly hated
   by the generality of people, on account of the calumnies and false
   reports which had been circulated against him, that almost all men
   judged that God was not less hostile to him than Saul [270] and his
   other enemies were. But here he speaks not so much according to the
   opinion of others, as according to the feeling of his own mind, when he
   complains of being neglected by God. Not that the persuasion of the
   truth of God's promises was extinguished in his heart, or that he did
   not repose himself on his grace; but when we are for a long time
   weighed down by calamities, and when we do not perceive any sign of
   divine aid, this thought unavoidably forces itself upon us, that God
   has forgotten us. To acknowledge in the midst of our afflictions that
   God has really a care about us, is not the usual way with men, or what
   the feelings of nature would prompt; but by faith we apprehend his
   invisible providence. Thus, it seemed to David, so far as could be
   judged from beholding the actual state of his affairs, that he was
   forsaken of God. At the same time, however, the eyes of his mind,
   guided by the light of faith, penetrated even to the grace of God,
   although it was hidden in darkness. When he saw not a single ray of
   good hope to whatever quarter he turned, so far as human reason could
   judge, constrained by grief, he cries out that God did not regard him;
   and yet by this very complaint he gives evidence that faith enabled him
   to rise higher, and to conclude, contrary to the judgment of the flesh,
   that his welfare was secure in the hand of God. Had it been otherwise,
   how could he direct his groanings and prayers to him? Following this
   example, we must so wrestle against temptations as to be assured by
   faith, even in the very midst of the conflict, that the calamities
   which urge us to despair must be overcome; just as we see that the
   infirmity of the flesh could not hinder David from seeking God, and
   having recourse to him: and thus he has united in his exercise, very
   beautifully, affections which are apparently contrary to each other.
   The words, How long, for ever? are a defective form of expression; but
   they are much more emphatic than if he had put the question according
   to the usual mode of speaking, Why for so long a time? By speaking
   thus, he gives us to understand, that for the purpose of cherishing his
   hope, and encouraging himself in the exercise of patience, he extended
   his view to a distance, and that, therefore, he does not complain of a
   calamity of a few days' duration, as the effeminate and the cowardly
   are accustomed to do, who see only what is before their feet, and
   immediately succumb at the first assault. He teaches us, therefore, by
   his example, to stretch our view as far as possible into the future,
   that our present grief may not entirely deprive us of hope.

   2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul? We know that men in
   adversity give way to discontent, and look around them, first to one
   quarter, and then to another, in search of remedies. Especially, upon
   seeing that they are destitute of all resources, they torment
   themselves greatly, and are distracted by a multitude of thoughts; and
   in great dangers, anxiety and fear compel them to change their purposes
   from time to time, when they do not find any plan upon which they can
   fix with certainty. David, therefore, complains, that while thinking of
   different methods of obtaining relief, and deliberating with himself
   now in one way, and now in another, he is exhausted to no purpose with
   the multitude of suggestions which pass through his mind; and by
   joining to this complaint the sorrow which he felt daily, he points out
   the source of this disquietude. As in severe sickness the diseased
   would desire to change their place every moment, and the more acute the
   pains which afflict them are, the more fitful and eager are they in
   shifting and changing; so, when sorrow seizes upon the hearts of men,
   its miserable victims are violently agitated within, and they find it
   more tolerable to torment themselves without obtaining relief, than to
   endure their afflictions with composed and tranquil minds. The Lord,
   indeed, promises to give to the faithful "the spirit of counsels"
   (Isaiah 11:2) but he does not always give it to them at the very
   beginning of any matter in which they are interested, but suffers them
   for a time to be embarrassed by long deliberation without coming to a
   determinate decision, [271] or to be perplexed, as if they were
   entangled among thorns, not knowing whither to turn, [272] or what
   course to take. Some explain the Hebrew word yvmm, yomam, as meaning
   all the day long. But it seems to me, that by it is rather meant
   another kind of continuance, namely, that his sorrow returned, and was
   renewed every day. In the end of the verse he deplores another evil,
   that his adversaries triumph over him the more boldly, when they see
   him wholly enfeebled, and as it were wasted by continual languor. Now
   this is an argument of great weight in our prayers; for there is
   nothing which is more displeasing to God, and which he will less bear
   with, than the cruel insolence which our enemies display, when they not
   only feast themselves by beholding us in misery, but also rise up the
   higher against us, and treat us the more disdainfully, the more they
   see us oppressed and afflicted.

   against him; and the reason which he assigns for this opinion is, "that

   full of confidence; but that of Absalom was after it, which made him

   Psalm 13:3-4

   3. Behold, [or look upon me,] answer me, O Jehovah my God; enlighten
   mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; 4. Lest my enemy say, I have
   prevailed against him; and those who afflict me rejoice if I should
   fall.


   3. Look upon me, answer me. As when God does not promptly afford
   assistance to his servants, it seems to the eye of sense that he does
   not behold their necessities, David, for this reason, asks God, in the
   first place, to look upon him, and, in the second place, to succor him.
   Neither of these things, it is true, is prior or posterior in respect
   of God; but it has been already stated in a preceding psalm, and we
   will have occasion afterwards frequently to repeat the statement, that
   the Holy Spirit purposely accommodates to our understanding the models
   of prayer recorded in Scripture. If David had not been persuaded that
   God had his eyes upon him, it would have availed him nothing to cry to
   God; but this persuasion was the effect of faith. In the meantime,
   until God actually puts forth his hand to give relief, carnal reason
   suggests to us that he shuts his eyes, and does not behold us. The
   manner of expression here employed amounts to the same thing as if he
   had put the mercy of God in the first place, and then added to it his
   assistance, because God then hears us, when, having compassion upon us,
   he is moved and induced to succor us. To enlighten the eyes signifies
   the same thing in the Hebrew language as to give the breath of life,
   for the rigour of life appears chiefly in the eyes. In this sense
   Solomon says,

   "The poor and the deceitful man meet together; the Lord lighteneth both
   their eyes." (Proverbs 29:13)

   And when Jonathan fainted for hunger, the sacred history relates that
   his eyes were overcast with dimness; and again, that when he had tasted
   of the honeycomb, his eyes were enlightened, (1 Samuel 14:27.) The word
   sleep, as it is used in this passage, is a metaphor of a similar kind,
   being put for death. In short, David confesses, that unless God cause
   the light of life to shine upon him, he will be immediately overwhelmed
   with the darkness of death, and that he is already as a man without
   life, unless God breathe into him new vigor. And certainly our
   confidence of life depends on this, that although the world may
   threaten us with a thousand deaths, yet God is possessed of numberless
   means of restoring us to life. [273]

   4. Lest my enemy. David again repeats what he had a little before said
   concerning the pride of his enemies, namely, how it would be a thing
   ill becoming the character of God were he to abandon his servant to the
   mockery of the ungodly. David's enemies lay, as it were, in ambush
   watching the hour of his ruin, that they might deride him when they saw
   him fall. And as it is the peculiar office of God to repress the
   audacity and insolence of the wicked, as often as they glory in their
   wickedness, David beseeches God to deprive them of the opportunity of
   indulging in such boasting. It is, however, to be observed, that he had
   in his conscience a sufficient testimony to his own integrity, and that
   he trusted also in the goodness of his cause, so that it would have
   been unbecoming and unreasonable had he been left without succor in
   danger, and had he been overwhelmed by his enemies. We can, therefore,
   with confidence pray for ourselves, in the manner in which David here
   does for himself, only when we fight under the standard of God, and are
   obedient to his orders, so that our enemies cannot obtain the victory
   over us without wickedly triumphing over God himself.

   Psalm 13:5

   5. But I trust in thy goodness; my heart shall exult in thy salvation.
   I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
   [274]


   The Psalmist does not as yet feel how much he has profited by praying;
   but depending upon the hope of deliverance, which the faithful promise
   of God enabled him to entertain, he makes use of this hope as a shield
   to repel those temptations with the terror of which he might be greatly
   distressed. Although, therefore, he is severely afflicted, and a
   multiplicity of cares urge him to despair, he, notwithstanding,
   declares it to be his resolution to continue firm in his reliance upon
   the grace of God, and in the hope of salvation. With the very same
   confidence ought all the godly to be furnished and sustained, that they
   may duly persevere in prayer. Whence, also, we gather what I have
   formerly adverted to, that it is by faith we apprehend the grace of
   God, which is hidden from and unknown to the understanding of the
   flesh. As the verbs which the Psalmist uses are not put in the same
   tense, different meanings may be drawn from the different tenses; but
   David, I have no doubt, here wishes to testify that he continued firm
   in the hope of the deliverance promised to him, and would continue so
   even to the end, however heavy the burden of temptations which might
   press upon him. Accordingly, the word exult is put in the future tense,
   to denote the continued exercise of the affection spoken of, and that
   no affliction shall ever shake out of his heart the joy of faith. It is
   to be observed, that he places the goodness of God first in order, as
   being the cause of his deliverance, -- I will sing unto the Lord I
   translate this into the future tense. David, it is true, had not yet
   obtained what he earnestly desired, but being fully convinced that God
   was already at hand to grant him deliverance, he pledges himself to
   give thanks to him for it. And surely it becomes us to engage in prayer
   in such a frame of mind as at the same time to be ready to sing the
   praises of God; a thing which is impossible, unless we are fully
   persuaded that our prayers will not be ineffectual. We may not be
   wholly free from sorrow, but it is nevertheless necessary that this
   cheerfulness of faith rise above it, and put into our mouth a song on
   account of the joy which is reserved for us in the future although not
   as yet experienced by us; [275] just as we see David here preparing
   himself to celebrate in songs the grace of God, before he perceives the
   issue of his troubles. The word gml, gamal, [276] which others render
   to reward, signifies nothing else here than to bestow a benefit from
   pure grace, and this is its meaning in many other passages of
   Scripture. What kind of thanksgiving, I pray you to consider, would
   that be, to say that God rewarded and rendered to his servant due
   recompense? This is sufficient to refute the absurd and trifling
   sophism of those who wrest this passage to prove the merit of works. In
   short, the only thing which remains to be observed is, that David, in
   hastening with promptitude of soul to sing of God's benefits before he
   had received them, places the deliverance, which was then apparently at
   a distance, immediately before his eyes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [274] The Septuagint here add another line, namely Kai psalo to onomati
   Kuriou tou hupsistou, "And I will sing to the name of Jehovah, the Most
   High." This line, which is the same with that which concludes the
   seventh psalm, has probably been lost in the Hebrew copy. "The
   conclusion of the psalm," says Lowth, "is manifestly defective; it ends
   with an odd hemistich wanting its correspondent. The LXX. have happily
   preserved it. That it is not a double translation of the single
   hemistich, now in the Hebrew, is apparent from the difference of the
   latter Greek hemistich, which does not at all correspond with the words
   of the former." -- Dr Lowth, in Merrick's note on this place.

   [275] "Qui ne nous est point encore presente." -- Fr.

   [276] gml Signifies "to return, to requite, to recompense, in whatever
   manner, whether evil for evil, good for evil, evil for good, or good
   for good." -- Parkhurst. Those who argue from this passage for the
   merit of good works, make the argument to rest on the notion of
   retribution attached to the word. But although it uniformly mean, to
   reward, no conclusive argument could here be drawn from this passage in
   support of that doctrine. What God bestows upon his people is sometimes
   called a reward in Scripture; not, however, because they can claim it
   as due to them by justice, but to express God's approbation of
   obedience, and the connection between obedience and happiness. Besides,
   gml, also means to deal kindly with, especially when applied to God,
   See Psalm 119:17, and 142:7. The word has this meaning in Arabic; and
   that it is to be thus understood in the passage before us is supported
   by the ancient versions. The Septuagint reads euergetesanti; and the
   Vulgate, bona tribuit, hath bestowed upon me good. The Arabic and
   Ethiopic adopt the same reading.

   PSALM 14.

   In the beginning the Psalmist describes the wicked contempt of God into
   which almost the whole people had broken forth. To give the greater
   weight to his complaint, he represents God himself as uttering it.
   Afterwards he comforts himself and others with the hope of a remedy,
   which he assures himself God will very soon provide, although, in the
   meantime, he groans and feels deep distress at the disorder which he
   beholds. [277]

   Psalm 14:1

   1. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God; they have
   corrupted; [278] , They have done abominable work; there is none that
   doeth good.


   Many of the Jews are of opinion that in this psalm there is given forth
   a prediction concerning the future oppression of their nation: as if
   David, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, bewailed the afflicted
   condition of the Church of God under the tyranny of the Gentiles. They
   therefore refer what is here spoken to the dispersed condition in which
   we see them at the present day, as if they were that precious heritage
   of God which the wild beasts devour. But it is very apparent, that in
   wishing to cover the disgrace of their nation, they wrest and apply to
   the Gentiles, without any just ground, what is said concerning the
   perverse children of Abraham. [279] We cannot certainly find a better
   qualified interpreter than the Apostle Paul, and he applies this psalm
   expressly to the people who lived under the law, (Romans 3:19.)
   Besides, although we had not the testimony of this Apostle, the
   structure of the psalm very clearly shows that David means rather the
   domestic tyrants and enemies of the faithful than foreign ones; a point
   which it is very necessary for us to understand. We know that it is a
   temptation which pains us exceedingly, to see wickedness breaking forth
   and prevailing in the midst of the Church, the good and the simple
   unrighteously afflicted, while the wicked cruelly domineer according to
   their pleasure. This sad spectacle almost completely disheartens us;
   and, therefore, we have much need to be fortified from the example
   which David here sets before us: so that, in the midst of the greatest
   desolations which we behold in the Church, we may comfort ourselves
   with this assurance, that God will finally deliver her from them. I
   have no doubt that there is here described the disordered and desolate
   state of Judea which Saul introduced when he began to rage openly.
   Then, as if the remembrance of God had been extinguished from the minds
   of men, all piety had vanished, and with respect to integrity or
   uprightness among men, there was just as little of it as of godliness.

   The fool hath said. As the Hebrew word nvl, nabal, signifies not only a
   fool, but also a perverse, vile, and contemptible person, it would not
   have been unsuitable to have translated it so in this place; yet I am
   content to follow the more generally received interpretation, which is,
   that all profane persons, who have cast off all fear of God and
   abandoned themselves to iniquity, are convicted of madness. David does
   not bring against his enemies the charge of common foolishness, but
   rather inveighs against the folly and insane hardihood of those whom
   the world accounts eminent for their wisdom. We commonly see that those
   who, in the estimation both of themselves and of others, highly excel
   in sagacity and wisdom, employ their cunning in laying snares, and
   exercise the ingenuity of their minds in despising and mocking God. It
   is therefore important for us, in the first place, to know, that
   however much the world applaud these crafty and scoffing characters,
   who allow themselves to indulge to any extent in wickedness, yet the
   Holy Spirit condemns them as being fools; for there is no stupidity
   more brutish than forgetfulness of God. We ought, however, at the same
   time, carefully to mark the evidence on which the Psalmist comes to the
   conclusion that they have cast off all sense of religion, and it is
   this: that they have overthrown all order, so that they no longer make
   any distinction between right and wrong, and have no regard for
   honesty, nor love of humanity. David, therefore, does not speak of the
   hidden affection of the heart of the wicked, except in so far as they
   discover themselves by their external actions. The import of his
   language is, How does it come to pass, that these men indulge
   themselves in their lusts so boldly and so outrageously, that they pay
   no regard to righteousness or equity; in short, that they madly rush
   into every kind of wickedness, if it is not because they have shaken
   off all sense of religion, and extinguished, as far as they can, all
   remembrance of God from their minds? When persons retain in their heart
   any sense of religion, they must necessarily have some modesty, and be
   in some measure restrained and prevented from entirely disregarding the
   dictates of their conscience. From this it follows, that when the
   ungodly allow themselves to follow their own inclinations, so
   obstinately and audaciously as they are here represented as doing,
   without any sense of shame, it is an evidence that they have cast off
   all fear of God.

   The Psalmist says that they speak in their heart They may not utter
   this detestable blasphemy, There is no God, with their mouths; but the
   unbridled licentiousness of their life loudly and distinctly declares
   that in their hearts, which are destitute of all godliness, they
   soothingly sing to themselves this song. Not that they maintain, by
   drawn out arguments or formal syllogisms, as they term them, that there
   is no God, (for to render them so much the more inexcusable, God from
   time to time causes even the most wicked of men to feel secret pangs of
   conscience, that they may be compelled to acknowledge his majesty and
   sovereign power;) but whatever right knowledge God instils into them
   they partly stifle it by their malice against him, and partly corrupt
   it, until religion in them becomes torpid, and at last dead. They may
   not plainly deny the existence of a God, but they imagine him to be
   shut up in heaven, and divested of his righteousness and power; and
   this is just to fashion an idol in the room of God. As if the time
   would never come when they will have to appear before him in judgment,
   [280] they endeavor, in all the transactions and concerns of their
   life, to remove him to the greatest distance, and to efface from their
   minds all apprehension of his majesty. [281] And when God is dragged
   from his throne, and divested of his character as judge, impiety has
   come to its utmost height; and, therefore, we must conclude that David
   has most certainly spoken according to truth, in declaring that those
   who give themselves liberty to commit all manner of wickedness, in the
   flattering hope of escaping with impunity, deny in their heart that
   there is a God. As the fifty-third psalm, with the exception of a few
   words which are altered in it, is just a repetition of this psalm, I
   will show in the proper places, as we proceed, the difference which
   there is between the two psalms. David here complains that they have
   done abominable work; but for the word work, the term there employed is
   iniquity. It should be observed that David does not speak of one work
   or of two; but as he had said, that they have perverted or corrupted
   all lawful order, so now he adds, that they have so polluted their
   whole life, as to make it abominable, and the proof of this which he
   adduces is, that they have no regard to uprightness in their dealings
   with one another, but have forgotten all humanity, and all beneficence
   towards their fellow-creatures.

   [278] Calvin has here given a literal rendering of the Hebrew words,
   They have corrupted. Some suppose that themselves is to be understood,
   as in Exodus 32:7; others, their ways, as in Genesis 6:12, but the
   meaning which Calvin has attached to the phrase is, They have corrupted
   or perverted all good order.

   [280] Some critics observe, that as yhvh, Yehovah, the name which
   denotes the infinite, self-existent essence of God, is not the word
   here employed, but 'lvhs, a name which they regard as referring to God
   as judge and governor of the world, the meaning of the first verse is
   not that the fool denies the existence of God, but only his providence
   and government of the world; that he persuades himself God has no
   concern about the actions of men, and that there will be no judgment to
   come; and, therefore, goes on in sin, in the hope of escaping with
   impunity. -- See Poole's Synopsis Criticorum. The Targum paraphrases

   Psalm 14:2-3

   2. Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
   whether there were any that did understand, and seek after God. 3.
   Every one of them has gone aside, they have altogether become putrid,
   [or rotten;] there is none that doeth good, not even one,


   2. Jehovah looked down from heaven. God himself is here introduced as
   speaking on the subject of human depravity, and this renders the
   discourse of David more emphatic than if he had pronounced the sentence
   in his own person. When God is exhibited to us as sitting on his throne
   to take cognisance of the conduct of men, unless we are stupified in an
   extraordinary degree, his majesty must strike us with terror. The
   effect of the habit of sinning is, that men grow hardened in their
   sins, and discern nothing, as if they were enveloped in thick darkness.
   David, therefore, to teach them that they gain nothing by flattering
   and deceiving themselves as they do, when wickedness reigns in the
   world with impunity, testifies that God looks down from heaven, and
   casts his eyes on all sides, for the purpose of knowing what is done
   among men. God, it is true, has no need to make inquisition or search;
   but when he compares himself to an earthly judge, it is in adaptation
   to our limited capacity, and to enable us gradually to form some
   apprehension of his secret providence, which our reason cannot all at
   once comprehend. Would to God that this manner of speaking had the
   effect of teaching us to summon ourselves before his tribunal; and
   that, while the world are flattering themselves, and the reprobate are
   trying to bury their sins in forgetfulness by their want of thought,
   hypocrisy, or shamelessness, and are blinded in their obstinacy as if
   they were intoxicated, we might be led to shake off all indifference
   and stupidity by reflecting on this truth, that God, notwithstanding,
   looks down from his high throne in heaven, and beholds what is going on
   here below!

   To see if there were any that did understand As the whole economy of a
   good and righteous life depends upon our being governed and directed by
   the light of understanding, David has justly taught us in the beginning
   of the psalm, that folly is the root of all wickedness. And in this
   clause he also very justly declares, that the commencement of integrity
   and uprightness of life consists in an enlightened and sound mind. But
   as the greater part misapply their intellectual powers to deceitful
   purposes, David immediately after defines, in one word, what true
   understanding is, namely, that it consists in seeking after God; by
   which he means, that unless men devote themselves wholly to God, their
   life cannot be well ordered. Some understand the word mskyl, maskil,
   which we translated, that did understand, in too restricted a sense;
   whereas David declares that the reprobate are utterly destitute of all
   reason and judgment.

   Every one of them has gone aside. Some translate the word sr, sar,
   which is here used, to stink, [282] as if the reading were, Every one
   of them emits an offensive odour, that it may correspond in meaning
   with the verb in the next clause, which in Hebrew signifies to become
   putrid or rotten. But there is no necessity for explaining the two
   words in the same way, as if the same thing were repeated twice. The
   interpretation is more appropriate, which supposes that men are here
   condemned as guilty of a detestable revolt, inasmuch as they are
   estranged from God, or have departed far from him; and that afterwards
   there is pointed out the disgusting corruption or putrescence of their
   whole life, as if nothing could proceed from apostates but what smells
   rank of rottenness and infection. The Hebrew word sr, sar, is almost
   universally taken in this sense. In the 53rd Psalm, the word sg, sag,
   is used, which signifies the same thing. In short, David declares that
   all men are so carried away by their capricious lusts, that nothing is
   to be found either of purity or integrity in their whole life. This,
   therefore, is defection so complete, that it extinguishes all
   godliness. Besides, David here not only censures a portion of the
   people, but pronounces them all to be equally involved in the same
   condemnation. This was, indeed, a prodigy well fitted to excite
   abhorrence, that all the children of Abraham, whom God had chosen to be
   his peculiar people, were so corrupt from the least to the greatest.

   But it might be asked, how David makes no exception, how he declares
   that not a righteous person remains, not even one, when, nevertheless,
   he informs us, a little after, that the poor and afflicted put their
   trust in God? Again, it might be asked, if all were wicked, who was
   that Israel whose future redemption he celebrates in the end of the
   psalm? Nay, as he himself was one of the body of that people, why does
   he not at least except himself? I answer: It is against the carnal and
   degenerate body of the Israelitish nation that he here inveighs, and
   the small number constituting the seed which God had set apart for
   himself is not included among them. This is the reason why Paul, in his
   Epistle to the Romans 3:10, extends this sentence to all mankind.
   David, it is true, deplores the disordered and desolate state of
   matters under the reign of Saul. At the same time, however, he
   doubtless makes a comparison between the children of God and all who
   have not been regenerated by the Spirit, but are carried away according
   to the inclinations of their flesh. [283] Some give a different
   explanation, maintaining that Paul, by quoting the testimony of David,
   did not understand him as meaning that men are naturally depraved and
   corrupt; and that the truth which David intended to teach is, that the
   rulers and the more distinguished of the people were wicked, and that,
   therefore, it was not surprising to behold unrighteousness and
   wickedness prevailing so generally in the world. This answer is far
   from being satisfactory. The subject which Paul there reasons upon is
   not, what is the character of the greater part of men, but what is the
   character of all who are led and governed by their own corrupt nature.
   It is, therefore, to be observed, that when David places himself and
   the small remnant of the godly on one side, and puts on the other the
   body of the people, in general, this implies that there is a manifest
   difference between the children of God who are created anew by his
   Spirit, and all the posterity of Adam, in whom corruption and depravity
   exercise dominion. Whence it follows, that all of us, when we are born,
   bring with us from our mother's womb this folly and filthiness
   manifested in the whole life, which David here describes, and that we
   continue such until God make us new creatures by his mysterious grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [282] Hammond admits that the word sr, sar, means to go aside, or to
   decline, and that it is commonly applied to a way or path, declining
   from the right way, or going in a wrong way. But he thinks that the
   idea here is different, that it is taken from wine when it grows dead
   or sour, just as the word is used in this sense in Hosea 4:18, sr sv'm,
   sar sobim, "Their drink is gone aside, or grown sour." He considers
   this view corroborated from the clause which immediately follows,
   n'lchv, ne-elachu, they are become putrid, which is derived from 'lh,
   alach, to be rotten or putrified, referring properly to flesh which has
   become putrid. "Thus," says he, "the proportion is well kept between
   drink and meat, the one growing dead or sour, as the other putrifies
   and stinks, and then is good for nothing, but is thrown away."

   [283] David speaks of all mankind, with the exception of the "people of
   God," and "the generation of the righteous," spoken of in verses 4, 5
   who are opposed to the rest of the human race.

   Psalm 14:4

   4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people
   as they eat bread? they call not upon the Lord. [284]


   This question is added to give a more amplified illustration of the
   preceding doctrine. The prophet had said that God observed from heaven
   the doings of men, and had found all of them gone out of the way; and
   now he introduces him exclaiming with astonishment, What madness is
   this, that they who ought to cherish my people, and assiduously perform
   to them every kind office, are oppressing and falling upon them like
   wild beasts, without any feeling of humanity? He attributes this manner
   of speaking to God, not because any thing can happen which is strange
   or unexpected to him, but in order the more forcibly to express his
   indignation. The Prophet Isaiah, in like manner, (Isaiah 59:16,) when
   treating of almost the same subject, says,

   "And God saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
   intercessor." (Isaiah 59:16)

   God, it is true, does not actually experience in himself such
   affections, but he represents himself as invested with them, that we
   may entertain the greatest horror and dread on account of our sins,
   when he declares them to be of so monstrous a character, that he is as
   it were thrown into agitation and disorder by them. And were we not
   harder than the stones, our horror at the wickedness which prevails in
   the world would make the hair of our head to stand on end, [285] seeing
   God exhibits to us in his own person such a testimony of the
   detestation with which he regards it. Moreover, this verse confirms
   what I have said in the commencement, that David does not speak in this
   psalm of foreign tyrants, or the avowed enemies of the church, but of
   the rulers and princes of his people, who were furnished with power and
   honor. This description would not apply to men who were altogether
   strangers to the revealed will of God; for it would be nothing
   wonderful to see those who do not possess the moral law, the rule of
   life, devoting themselves to the work of violence and oppression. But
   the heinousness of the proceedings condemned is not a little aggravated
   from this circumstance, that it is the shepherds themselves, whose
   office it is to feed and to take care of the flock, [286] who cruelly
   devour it, and who spare not even the people and heritage of God. There
   is a similar complaint in Micah 3:1-3,

   "And I said, Hear I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the
   house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment? Who hate the good
   and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them; and their
   flesh from off their bones; who also eat the flesh of my people, and
   flay their skin from off them,"

   etc. If those who profess to know and to serve God were to exercise
   such cruelty towards the Babylonians or Egyptians, it would be a piece
   of injustice which could admit of no excuse; but when they glut
   themselves with the blood and flesh of the saints, as they devour
   bread, this is such monstrous iniquity, that it may well strike both
   angels and men with astonishment. Had such persons a particle of sound
   understanding remaining in them, it would restrain them from conduct so
   fearfully infatuated. They must, therefore, be completely blinded by
   the devil, and utterly bereft of reason and understanding, seeing they
   knowingly and willingly flay and devour the people of God with such
   inhumanity. This passage teaches us how displeasing to God, and how
   abominable is the cruelty which is exercised against the godly, by
   those who pretend to be their shepherds. In the end of the verse, where
   he says that they call not upon the Lord, he again points out the
   source and cause of this unbridled wickedness, namely, that such
   persons have no reverence for God. Religion is the best mistress for
   teaching us mutually to maintain equity and uprightness towards each
   other; and where a concern for religion is extinguished, then all
   regard for justice perishes along with it. With respect to the phrase,
   calling upon God, as it constitutes the principal exercise of
   godliness, it includes by synecdoche, (a figure of rhetoric, by which a
   part is put for the whole,) not only here, but in many other passages
   of Scripture, the whole of the service of God.

   yhvh, is always rendered by ho Kurios, the Lord, which is equivalent to
   Dominus, and is expressive of dominion or property, -- a word which
   implies a different idea from the name Jehovah, which denotes
   independent and eternal existence. The translators of the Septuagint
   used ho Kurios, for yhv in accommodation to the scruples of the Jews,

   Psalm 14:5-6

   5. There did they tremble with fear, [287] for God is in [or with, or
   for [288] ] the generation of the righteous. 6. Ye deride the counsel
   of the poor, because Jehovah is his hope.


   5. There did they tremble with fear, The prophet now encourages himself
   and all the faithful with the best of all consolations, namely, that
   God will not forsake his people even to the end, but will at length
   show himself to be their defender. Some explain the adverb of place
   there, as meaning that God will take vengeance on the wicked in the
   presence of his saints, because they exercised their tyranny upon them.
   But I rather think that by this word there is expressed the certainty
   of their punishment, [289] as if the Psalmist pointed to it with the
   finger. [290] It may also intimate what we may gather from Psalm 53,
   that the judgment of God would come upon them suddenly, and when they
   were not thinking about it; for it is there added, where no fear is,
   or, where no fear was. [291] Expositors, I am aware, differ in their
   interpretation of these words. Some supply the word equal or like, and
   read, There is no fear equal to it. Others refer them to those secret
   alarms with which the ungodly are tormented, even when there may be no
   ground for apprehension. God threatens the transgressors of his law
   with such mental torment that they "shall flee when none pursueth
   them," (Leviticus 26:17, and Proverbs 28:1) and that "the sound of a
   shaking leaf shall chase them," (Leviticus 26:36) just as we see that
   they are themselves their own tormentors, and are agitated with mental
   trouble even when there is no external cause to create it. But I think
   the meaning of the prophet is different, namely, that when their
   affairs are in a state of the greatest tranquillity and prosperity, God
   will suddenly launch against them the bolts of his vengeance.

   "For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction
   cometh upon them," (1 Thessalonians 5:3.)

   The prophet, therefore, encourages and supports the faithful with this
   prospect, that the ungodly, when they think themselves free from all
   danger, and are securely celebrating their own triumphs, shall be
   overwhelmed with sudden destruction.

   The reason of this is added in the last clause of the verse, namely,
   because God is determined to defend the righteous, and to take in hand
   their cause: For God is in the generation of the righteous Now, in
   order to preserve them safe, he must necessarily thunder in his wrath
   from heaven against their enemies, who unjustly oppress and waste them
   by violence and extortion. [292] There is, however, some ambiguity in
   the word dvr, dor, which we have translated generation. As this noun in
   Hebrew sometimes signifies an age, or, the course of human life, the
   sentence might be explained as follows: Although God for a time may
   seem to take no notice of the wrongs inflicted upon his servants by the
   wicked, yet he is ever present with them, and exercises his grace
   towards them during their whole life. But it seems to me a more simple
   and natural exposition to interpret the clause thus: That God is on the
   side of the righteous, and takes their part, as we say, [293] so that
   dvr, dor, will have the same signification here which the word natio,
   [nation,] sometimes has among the Latins.

   In Psalm 53:5, the Psalmist adds a sentence which does not occur in
   this psalm, For God hath scattered the bones of him that besiegeth
   thee, thou shalt put them to shame; because God hath rejected them. By
   these words the prophet explains more clearly how God protects the
   righteous, that it is by delivering them from the jaws of death, just
   as if one were to put to flight those who had laid siege to a town, and
   were to set at liberty its inhabitants, who before were in great
   extremity and quite shut up. [294] Whence it follows, that we must
   patiently bear oppression, if we desire to be protected and preserved
   by the hand of God, at the time of our greatest danger. The expression,
   bones, is used metaphorically for strength or power. The prophet
   particularly speaks of their power; for if the wicked were not
   possessed of riches, ammunition, and troops, which render them
   formidable, it would not appear, with sufficient evidence, that it is
   the hand of God which at length crushes them. The Psalmist next exhorts
   the faithful to a holy boasting, and bids them rest assured that an
   ignominious destruction hangs over the heads of the wicked. The reason
   of this is, because God hath rejected them; and if he is opposed to
   them, all things must ultimately go ill with them. As m's, maäs, which
   we have translated to reject, sometimes signifies to despise, some
   render it thus, Because God hath despised them; but this, I think, does
   not suit the passage. It would be more appropriate to read, -- He hath
   rendered them contemptible, or, subjected them to disgrace and
   ignominy. Whence it follows, that they only draw down upon themselves
   dishonor and infamy while they strive to elevate themselves, as it
   were, in despite of God.

   6. Ye deride the counsel of the poor. He inveighs against those giants
   who mock at the faithful for their simplicity, in calmly expecting, in
   their distresses, that God will show himself to be their deliverer.
   And, certainly, nothing seems more irrational to the flesh than to
   betake ourselves to God when yet he does not relieve us from our
   calamities; and the reason is, because the flesh judges of God only
   according to what it presently beholds of his grace. Whenever,
   therefore, unbelievers see the children of God overwhelmed with
   calamities, they reproach them for their groundless confidence, as it
   appears to them to be, and with sarcastic jeers laugh at the assured
   hope with which they rely upon God, from whom, notwithstanding, they
   receive no sensible aid. David, therefore, defies and derides this
   insolence of the wicked, and threatens that their mockery of the poor
   and the wretched, and their charging them with folly in depending upon
   the protection of God, and not sinking under their calamities, will be
   the cause of their destruction. At the same time, he teaches them that
   there is no resolution to which we can come which is better advised
   than the resolution to depend upon God, and that to repose on his
   salvation, and on the assistance which he hath promised us, even
   although we may be surrounded with calamities, is the highest wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [287] It is the general opinion that this psalm was composed during the
   alarm and danger which were occasioned by Absalom's rebellion, and that
   this is a prediction of the failure of the conspiracy. But Calmet and
   Mudge refer the psalm to the captivity in Babylon, and the latter
   supposes that in this and the preceding verse there is an allusion to
   the great terror into which the heathen were thrown, in the midst of
   their impious carousals; which some refer to the scene which took place
   at Belshazzar's feast, when the hand was seen writing on the wall.
   There is, however, great uncertainty as to the occasions on which most
   of the psalms were composed; and those who have examined the different
   opinions of interpreters on this subject must be convinced of the
   difficulty of arriving at any thing like certainty in regard to it.

   [289] Though punishment had not as yet been actually inflicted on the
   oppressors of the people of God, of whom the Psalmist had spoken in the
   preceding verse, he speaks of their punishment as if it had taken
   place. The reason of this manner of speaking concerning things future
   in prophetic poetry, Horsley explains to be this, "That a scene typical
   of futurity is presented to the prophet's imagination, and what he sees
   in that scene he speaks of as done."

   Psalm 14:7

   7. Who shall give salvation [or deliverance] to Israel out of Sion?
   When Jehovah shall have brought back the captivity of his people, Jacob
   shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.


   David, after having laid down the doctrine of consolation, again
   returns to prayers and groanings. By this he teaches us, that although
   God may leave us for a long time to languish, yet we ought not to
   weary, or lose courage, but should always glory in him; and, again,
   that while our troubles continue, the most effectual solace we can have
   is often to return to the exercise of prayer. When he asks the
   question, Who shall give salvation? this does not imply, that he was
   looking either to the right hand or to the left, or that he turned away
   his eyes from God in search of another deliverer; he intends only to
   express the ardor of his desire, as if he had said, When will the time
   at length come when God will display his salvation, and make it fully
   manifest? By the word Sion, which he adds, he testifies that his hope
   is fixed on God; for Sion was the holy place from which God had
   promised to hear the prayers of his servants; and it was the
   dwelling-place of the ark of the covenant, which was an external pledge
   and symbol of the presence of God. He does not, therefore, doubt who
   would be the author of his salvation; but he asks, with a sorrowful
   heart, when at length that salvation will come forth which is to be
   expected from no other source than from God alone. The question may,
   however, be put, if this prayer refers to the time of Saul, how can
   Sion, with propriety, be named as being already the sanctuary of God? I
   will not deny that the Psalmist, by the spirit of prophecy, may have
   predicted what had not yet actually taken place; but I think it highly
   probable, that this psalm was not composed until the ark of the
   covenant had been placed on mount Sion. David, as we know, employed his
   leisure hours in committing to writing, for the benefit of posterity,
   events which had happened long before. Besides, by expressing his
   desire for the deliverance of Israel, we are taught that he was chiefly
   anxious about the welfare of the whole body of the Church, and that his
   thoughts were more occupied about this than about himself individually.
   This is worthy of being the more carefully marked when we consider,
   that, while our attention is engrossed with our own particular sorrows,
   we are in danger of almost entirely neglecting the welfare of our
   brethren. And yet the particular afflictions with which God visits each
   of us are intended to admonish us to direct our attention and care to
   the whole body of the Church, and to think of its necessities, just as
   we see David here including Israel with himself.

   When the Lord shall have brought back the captivity of his people, In
   these words, David concludes, that God will not suffer the faithful to
   languish under continual sorrow, according as it is said in another
   psalm, (Psalm 126:5) "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy." He
   doubtless aims at confirming and encouraging himself and all the godly
   to hope for the promised deliverance. He therefore says, in the first
   place, that although God may delay, or at least may not make so much
   haste as we would wish, he will, nevertheless, show himself to be the
   defender of his people, by redeeming them from captivity. And, in the
   next place, he assuages their sorrow, by setting forth that the issue
   of it will be joyful, seeing it will at length be turned into gladness.
   The captivity, of which he makes mention, is not the Babylonish, or the
   dispersion of his people among the heathen nations; it rather refers to
   an oppression at home, when the wicked exercise dominion like tyrants
   in the Church. We are, therefore, taught by these words, that when such
   furious enemies waste and destroy the flock of God, or proudly tread it
   under foot, we ought to have recourse to God, whose peculiar office it
   is to gather together his Israel from all places whither they have been
   dispersed. And the term captivity, which he employs, implies, that when
   the wicked overthrow at their pleasure all good and lawful order in the
   midst of the Church, it is converted into a Babylon or Egypt. Farther,
   although David defers the joy of the holy people, to the time of their
   deliverance, yet the consolatory prospect of this should serve not only
   to moderate our grief, but also to mix and season it with joy.

   This psalm teaches us upon what condition God made choice of the Jews

   holy people, by leading a just and upright life.

   Psalm 15:1-2

   1. O Jehovah, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who shall rest in the
   mountain of thy holiness? 2. He who walketh in integrity, and doeth
   righteousness, and who speaketh truth in his heart.


   1. O Jehovah, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? As nothing is more
   common in the world than falsely to assume the name of God, or to
   pretend to be his people, and as a great part of men allow themselves
   to do this without any apprehension of the danger it involves, David,
   without stopping to speak to men, addresses himself to God, which he
   considers the better course; and he intimates, that if men assume the
   title of the people of God, without being so in deed and in truth, they
   gain nothing by their self-delusion, for God continues always like
   himself, and as he is faithful himself, so will he have us to keep
   faith with him in return. No doubt, he adopted Abraham freely, but, at
   the same time, he stipulated with him that he should live a holy and an
   upright life, and this is the general rule of the covenant which God
   has, from the beginning, made with his Church. The sum is, that
   hypocrites, who occupy a place in the temple of God, in vain pretend to
   be his people, for he acknowledges none as such but those who follow
   after justice and uprightness during the whole course of their life.
   David saw the temple crowded with a great multitude of men who all made
   a profession of the same religion, and presented themselves before God
   as to the outward ceremony; and, therefore, assuming the person of one
   wondering at the spectacle, he directs his discourse to God, who, in
   such a confusion and medley of characters, could easily distinguish his
   own people from strangers.

   There is a threefold use of this doctrine. In the first place, If we
   really wish to be reckoned among the number of the children of God, the
   Holy Ghost teaches us, that we must show ourselves to be such by a holy
   and an upright life; for it is not enough to serve God by outward
   ceremonies, unless we also live uprightly, and without doing wrong to
   our neighbors. In the second place, As we too often see the Church of
   God defaced by much impurity, to prevent us from stumbling at what
   appears so offensive, a distinction is made between those who are
   permanent citizens of the Church, and strangers who are mingled among
   them only for a time. This is undoubtedly a warning highly necessary,
   in order that when the temple of God happens to be tainted by many
   impurities, we may not contract such disgust and chagrin as will make
   us withdraw from it. By impurities I understand the vices of a corrupt
   and polluted life. Provided religion continue pure as to doctrine and
   worship, we must not be so much stumbled at the faults and sins which
   men commit, as on that account to rend the unity of the Church. Yet the
   experience of all ages teaches us how dangerous a temptation it is when
   we behold the Church of God, which ought to be free from all polluting
   stains, and to shine in uncorrupted purity, cherishing in her bosom
   many ungodly hypocrites, or wicked persons. From this the Catharists,
   Novatians, and Donatists, took occasion in former times to separate
   themselves from the fellowship of the godly. The Anabaptists, at the
   present day, renew the same schisms, because it does not seem to them
   that a church in which vices are tolerated can be a true church. But
   Christ, in Matthew 25:32, justly claims it as his own peculiar office
   to separate the sheep from the goats; and thereby admonishes us, that
   we must bear with the evils which it is not in our power to correct,
   until all things become ripe, and the proper season of purging the
   Church arrive. At the same time, the faithful are here enjoined, each
   in his own sphere, to use their endeavors that the Church of God may be
   purified from the corruptions which still exist within her. And this is
   the third use which we should make of this doctrine. God's sacred
   barn-floor will not be perfectly cleansed before the last day, when
   Christ at his coming will cast out the chaff; but he has already begun
   to do this by the doctrine of his gospel, which on this account he
   terms a fan. We must, therefore, by no means be indifferent about this
   matter; on the contrary, we ought rather to exert ourselves in good
   earnest, that all who profess themselves Christians may lead a holy and
   an unspotted life. But above all, what God here declares with respect
   to all the unrighteous should be deeply imprinted on our memory;
   namely, that he prohibits them from coming to his sanctuary, and
   condemns their impious presumption, in irreverently thrusting
   themselves into the society of the godly. David makes mention of the
   tabernacle, because the temple was not yet built. The meaning of his
   discourse, to express it in a few words, is this, that those only have
   access to God who are his genuine servants, and who live a holy life.

   2. He that walketh in integrity. Here we should mark, that in the words
   there is an implied contrast between the vain boasting of those who are
   only the people of God in name, or who make only a bare profession of
   being so, which consists in outward observances, and this indubitable
   and genuine evidence of true godliness which David commends. But it
   might be asked, As the service of God takes precedence of the duties of
   charity towards our neighbors, why is there no mention here made of
   faith and prayer; for, certainly, these are the marks by which the
   genuine children of God ought to have been distinguished from
   hypocrites? The answer is easy: David does not intend to exclude faith
   and prayer, and other spiritual sacrifices; but as hypocrites, in order
   to promote their own interests, are not sparing in their attention to a
   multiplicity of external religious observances, while their
   ungodliness, notwithstanding, is manifested outwardly in the life,
   seeing they are fall of pride, cruelty, violence, and are given to
   deceitfulness and extortion, - the Psalmist, for the purpose of
   discovering and drawing forth into the light all who are of such a
   character, takes the marks and evidences of true and sincere faith from
   the second table of the law. According to the care which every man
   takes to practice righteousness and equity towards his neighbors, so
   does he actually show that he fears God. David, then, is not here to be
   understood as resting satisfied with political or social justice, as if
   it were enough to render to our fellow-men what is their own, while we
   may lawfully defraud God of his right; but he describes the approved
   servants of God, as distinguished and known by the fruits of
   righteousness which they produce. In the first place, he requires
   sincerity; in other words, that men should conduct themselves in all
   their affairs with singleness of heart, and without sinful craft or
   cunning. Secondly, he requires justice; that is to say, that they
   should study to do good to their neighbors, hurt nobody, and abstain
   from all wrong. Thirdly, he requires truth in their speech, so that
   they may speak nothing falsely or deceitfully. To speak in the heart is
   a strong figurative expression, but it expresses more forcibly David's
   meaning than if he had said from the heart. It denotes such agreement
   and harmony between the heart and tongue, as that the speech is, as it
   were, a vivid representation of the hidden affection or feeling within.

   Psalm 15:3

   3. He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
   companion, nor raiseth up a calumnious report against his neighbor.


   David, after having briefly set forth the virtues with which all who
   desire to have a place in the Church ought to be endued, now enumerates
   certain vices from which they ought to be free. In the first place, he
   tells them that they must not be slanderers or detractors; secondly,
   that they must restrain themselves from doing any thing mischievous and
   injurious to their neighbors; and, thirdly, that they must not aid in
   giving currency to calumnies and false reports. Other vices, from which
   the righteous are free, we shall meet with as we proceed. David, then,
   sets down calumny and detraction as the first point of injustice by
   which our neighbors are injured. If a good name is a treasure, more
   precious than all the riches of the world, (Proverbs 22:1,) no greater
   injury can be inflicted upon men than to wound their reputation. It is
   not, however, every injurious word which is here condemned; but the
   disease and lust of detraction, which stirs up malicious persons to
   spread abroad calumnies. At the same time, it cannot be doubted that
   the design of the Holy Spirit is to condemn all false and wicked
   accusations. In the clause which immediately follows, the doctrine that
   the children of God ought to be far removed from all injustice, is
   stated more generally: Nor doeth evil to his companion. By the words
   companion and neighbor, the Psalmist means not only those with whom we
   enjoy familiar intercourse, and live on terms of intimate friendship,
   but all men, to whom we are bound by the ties of humanity and a common
   nature. He employs these terms to show more clearly the odiousness of
   what he condemns, and that the saints may have the greater abhorrence
   of all wrong dealing, since every man who hurts his neighbor violates
   the fundamental law of human society. With respect to the meaning of
   the last clause, interpreters are not agreed. Some take the phrase, to
   raise up a calumnious report, for to invent, because malicious persons
   raise up calumnies from nothing; and thus it would be a repetition of
   the statement contained in the first clause of the verse, namely, that
   good men should not allow themselves to indulge in detraction. But I
   think there is also here rebuked the vice of undue credulity, which,
   when any evil reports are spread against our neighbors, leads us either
   eagerly to listen to them, or at least to receive them without
   sufficient reason; whereas we ought rather to use all means to suppress
   and trample them under foot. [295] When any one is the bearer of
   invented falsehoods, those who reject them leave them, as it were, to
   fall to the ground; while, on the contrary, those who propagate and
   publish them from one person to another are, by an expressive form of
   speech, said to raise them up.

   Psalm 15:4

   4. In his eyes the offcast [or reprobate [296] ] is despised; but he
   honoureth them that fear the Lord; when he hath sworn to his own hurt,
   he changeth not.


   The first part of this verse is explained in different ways. Some draw
   from it this meaning, that the true servants of God are contemptible
   and worthless in their own estimation. If we adopt this interpretation,
   the copula and, which David does not express, must be supplied, making
   the reading thus, He is vile and despised in his own eyes. But besides
   the consideration, that, if this had been the sense, the words would
   probably have been joined together by the copula and, I have another
   reason which leads me to think that David had a different meaning, He
   compares together two opposite things, namely, to despise perverse and
   worthless characters, and to honor the righteous and those who fear
   God. In order that these two clauses may correspond with each other,
   the only sense in which I can understand what is here said about being
   despised is this, that the children of God despise the ungodly, and
   form that low and contemptuous estimate of them which their character
   deserves. The godly, it is true, although living a praiseworthy and
   virtuous life, are not inflated with presumption, but, on the contrary,
   are rather dissatisfied with themselves, because they feel how far
   short they are as yet of the perfection which is required. When,
   however, I consider what the scope of the passage demands, I do not
   think that we are here to view the Psalmist as commending humility or
   modesty, but rather a free and upright judgment of human character, by
   which the wicked, on the one hand, are not spared, while virtue, on the
   other, receives the honor which belongs to it; for flattery, which
   nourishes vices by covering them, is an evil not less pernicious than
   it is common. I indeed admit, that if the wicked are in authority, we
   ought not to carry our contempt of them the length of refusing to obey
   them in so far as a regard to our duty will permit; but, at the same
   time, we must beware of flattery and of accommodating ourselves to
   them, which would be to involve us in the same condemnation with them.
   He who not only seems to regard their wicked actions with indifference,
   but also honors them, shows that he approves of them as much as it is
   in his power. Paul therefore teaches us, (Ephesians 5:11,) that it is a
   species of fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness when we do
   not reprove them. It is certainly a very perverse way of acting, when
   persons, for the sake of obtaining the favor of men, will indirectly
   mock God; and all are chargeable with doing this who make it their
   business to please the wicked. David, however, has a respect, not so
   much to persons as to wicked works. The man who sees the wicked
   honored, and by the applause of the world rendered more obstinate in
   their wickedness, and who willingly gives his consent or approbation to
   this, does he not, by so doing, exalt vice to authority, and invest it
   with sovereign power? "But woe," says the prophet Isaiah, (Isaiah
   5:20,) "unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness
   for light, and light for darkness."

   Nor ought it to be regarded as a rude or violent manner of speaking,
   when David calls base and wicked persons reprobates, although they may
   be placed in an exalted and honorable station. If (as Cicero affirms,
   in his book entitled The Responses of the Aruspices) the inspectors of
   the entrails of the sacrifices, and other heathen soothsayers, applied
   to worthless and abandoned characters the term rejected, although they
   excelled in dignity and riches, why should not a prophet of God be
   permitted to apply the name of degraded outcasts to all who are
   rejected by God? The meaning of the Psalmist, to express it in a few
   words, is, that the children of God freely judge of every man's doings,
   and that for the purpose of obtaining the favor of men, they will not
   stoop to vile flattery, and thereby encourage the wicked in their
   wickedness.

   What follows immediately after, namely, to honor the righteous and
   those who fear God, is no mean virtue. As they are often, as it were,
   the filth and the offscouring of all things in the estimation of the
   world, so it frequently happens that those who show them favor and
   sympathy, excite against themselves every where the hatred of the
   world. The greater part of mankind, therefore, refuse the friendship of
   good men, and leave them to be despised, which cannot be done without
   grievous and heinous injury to God. Let us learn then not to value men
   by their estate or their money, or their transitory honors, but to hold
   in estimation godliness, or the fear of God. And certainly no man will
   ever truly apply his mind to the study of godliness who does not, at
   the same time, reverence the servants of God; as, on the other hand,
   the love we bear to them incites us to imitate them in sanctity of
   life.

   When he hath sworn to his own hurt. The translation of the LXX. would
   agree very well with the scope of the passage, were it not that the
   points which are under the words in the Hebrew text will not bear such
   a sense. [297] It is, indeed, no proof of the inaccuracy of their
   rendering, that it does not agree with the points; for, although the
   Jews have always used the points in reading, it is probable that they
   did not always express them in writing. I, however, prefer following
   the commonly received reading. And the meaning is, that the faithful
   will rather submit to suffer loss than break their word. When a man
   keeps his promises, in as far as he sees it to be for his own
   advantage, there is in this no argument to prove his uprightness and
   faithfulness. But when men make a promise to each other, there is
   nothing more common than from some slight loss which the performance of
   it would occasion, to endeavor to find a pretext for breaking their
   engagements. Every one considers with himself what is for his own
   advantage, and if it puts him to inconvenience or trouble to stand to
   his promises, he is ingenious enough to imagine that he will incur a
   far greater loss than there is any reason to apprehend. It seems,
   indeed, a fair excuse when a man complains that, if he does not depart
   from his engagement, he will suffer great loss. Hence it is, that we
   generally see so much unfaithfulness among men, that they do not
   consider themselves bound to perform the promises which they have made,
   except in so far as it will promote their own personal interest. David,
   therefore, condemning this inconstancy, requires the children of God to
   exhibit the greatest steadfastness in the fulfillment of their
   promises. Here the question might be asked, If a man, having fallen
   into the hands of a highwayman, promise him a sum of money to save his
   life, and if, in consequence of this, he is let go, should he in that
   case keep his promise? Again, if a man has been basely deceived, in
   entering into a contract, is it lawful for him to break the oath which
   he shall have made in such an engagement? With respect to the
   highwayman, he who confers upon him money falls into another fault, for
   he supports at his own expense a common enemy of mankind to the
   detriment of the public welfare. David does not impose upon the
   faithful such an alternative as this, but only enjoins them to show a
   greater regard to their promises than to their own personal interests,
   and to do this especially when their promises have been confirmed by an
   oath. As to the other case, namely, when a person has sworn, from being
   deceived and imposed upon by wicked artifice he ought certainly to hold
   the holy name of God in such veneration, as rather patiently to submit
   to loss than violate his oath. Yet it is perfectly lawful for him to
   discover or reveal the fraud which has been practiced upon him,
   provided he is not led to do so by a regard to his own personal
   interest; and there is, besides, nothing to hinder him from peaceably
   endeavoring to compromise the matter with his adversary. Many of the
   Jewish expositors restrict this passage to vows, as if David exhorted
   the faithful to perform their vows when they have promised to humble
   and afflict themselves by fasting. But in this they are mistaken.
   Nothing is farther from his meaning than this, for he discourses here
   only of the second table of the law, and of the mutual rectitude which
   men should maintain in their dealings with one another.

   Psalm, which relates to our dealing justly with our fellow-men; and it
   represents the good man as scrupulously performing the promissory oaths
   which he makes to his neighbor. But the ordinary reading, he sweareth
   to his own hurt, and changeth not, sets forth the moral integrity of
   the good man in a still more striking light, by describing him as
   performing his oath in the face of the greatest temptations to break
   it, when the performance of it may prove detrimental to his own
   interests; and this is no mean trial of a man's virtue.

   Psalm 15:5

   5. He putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh bribes upon the
   innocent. He that doeth these things shall not be moved for ever.


   In this verse David enjoins the godly neither to oppress their
   neighbors by usury, nor to suffer themselves to be corrupted with
   bribes to favor unrighteous causes. With respect to the first clause,
   as David seems to condemn all kinds of usury in general, and without
   exception, the very name has been every where held in detestation. But
   crafty men have invented specious names under which to conceal the
   vice; and thinking by this artifice to escape, they have plundered with
   greater excess than if they had lent on usury avowedly and openly. God,
   however, will not be dealt with and imposed upon by sophistry and false
   pretences. He looks upon the thing as it really is. There is no worse
   species of usury than an unjust way of making bargains, where equity is
   disregarded on both sides. Let us then remember that all bargains in
   which the one party unrighteously strives to make gain by the loss of
   the other party, whatever name may be given to them, are here
   condemned. It may be asked, Whether all kinds of usury are to be put
   into this denunciation, and regarded as alike unlawful? If we condemn
   all without distinction, there is a danger lest many, seeing themselves
   brought into such a strait, as to find that sin must be incurred, in
   whatever way they can turn themselves, may be rendered bolder by
   despair, and may rush headlong into all kinds of usury, without choice
   or discrimination. On the other hand, whenever we concede that
   something may be lawfully done this way, many will give themselves
   loose reins, thinking that a liberty to exercise usury, without control
   or moderation, has been granted them. In the first place, therefore, I
   would, above all things, counsel my readers to beware of ingeniously
   contriving deceitful pretexts, by which to take advantage of their
   fellow-men, and let them not imagine that any thing can be lawful to
   them which is grievous and hurtful to others.

   With respect to usury, it is scarcely possible to find in the world a
   usurer who is not at the same time an extortioner, and addicted to
   unlawful and dishonorable gain. Accordingly, Cato [298] of old justly
   placed the practice of usury and the killing of men in the same rank of
   criminality, for the object of this class of people is to suck the
   blood of other men. It is also a very strange and shameful thing, that,
   while all other men obtain the means of their subsistence with much
   toil, while husbandmen fatigue themselves by their daily occupations,
   and artisans serve the community by the sweat of their brow, and
   merchants not only employ themselves in labors, but also expose
   themselves to many inconveniences and dangers, -- that money-mongers
   should sit at their ease without doing any thing, and receive tribute
   from the labor of all other people. Besides, we know that generally it
   is not the rich who are exhausted by their usury, [299] but poor men,
   who ought rather to be relieved. It is not, therefore, without cause
   that God has, in Leviticus 25:35, 36, forbidden usury, adding this
   reason, "And if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with
   thee, then thou shalt relieve him; take thou no usury of him or
   increase." We see that the end for which the law was framed was, that
   men should not cruelly oppress the poor, who ought rather to receive
   sympathy and compassion. [300] This was, indeed, a part of the judicial
   law which God appointed for the Jews in particular; but it is a common
   principle of justice which extends to all nations and to all ages, that
   we should keep ourselves from plundering and devouring the poor who are
   in distress and want, Whence it follows, that the gain which he who
   lends his money upon interest acquires, without doing injury to any
   one, is not to be included under the head of unlawful usury. The Hebrew
   word nsk, neshek, which David employs, being derived from another word,
   which signifies to bite, sufficiently shows that usuries are condemned
   in so far as they involve in them or lead to a license of robbing and
   plundering our fellow-men. Ezekiel, indeed, Ezekiel 18:17, and Ezekiel
   22:12, seems to condemn the taking of any interest whatever upon money
   lent; but he doubtless has an eye to the unjust and crafty arts of
   gaining, by which the rich devoured the poor people. In short, provided
   we had engraven on our hearts the rule of equity, which Christ
   prescribes in Matthew 7:12,

   "Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
   do ye even so to them,"

   it would not be necessary to enter into lengthened disputes concerning
   usury.

   What next follows in the text properly applies to judges who, being
   corrupted by presents and rewards, pervert all law and justice. It may,
   however, be extended farther, inasmuch as it often happens, that even
   private individuals are corrupted by bribes to favor and defend bad
   causes. David, therefore, comprehends, in general, all those
   corruptions by which we are led away from truth and uprightness. Some
   think that what is here intended is the rapacity of judges in extorting
   money from the innocent who are accused, as the price of their
   deliverance, when they ought rather to have protected and assisted them
   gratuitously. But it appears from the passages similar to this in
   Ezekiel, which we have quoted, that the sense is different.

   He who doeth these things. This conclusion warns us again, that all who
   thrust themselves into the sanctuary of God are not permanent citizens
   of "the holy Jerusalem which is above;" [301] but that hypocrites, and
   all who falsely assume the title of saints, shall at length be "cast
   out" with Ishmael whom they resemble. That which is ascribed in Psalm
   46, to the whole Church, David here applies to every one of the
   faithful: He shall not be moved for ever. The reason of this which is
   there expressed is, because God dwells in the midst of Jerusalem. On
   the contrary, we know that he is far from the perfidious and the
   wicked, who approach him only with the mouth, and with reigned lips.

   other. A more remote end seems also to have been aimed at, viz., to
   check the formation of a commercial character among the Jews, and to
   confine them as much as possible to those agricultural and private
   pursuits, which would seclude them from intercourse with the
   surrounding nations, as it was not very likely that a practice of this

   PSALM 16.

   In the beginning David commends himself to the protection of God. He
   then meditates upon the benefits which he received from God, and
   thereby stirs himself up to thanksgiving. By his service, it is true,
   he could in no respect be profitable to God, but he, notwithstanding,
   surrenders and devotes himself entirely to him, protesting that he will
   have nothing to do with superstitions. He also states the reason of
   this to be, that full and substantial happiness consists in resting in
   God alone, who never suffers his own people to want any good thing.

   Mictam of David.

   As to the meaning of the word mictam, the Jewish expositors are not of
   one mind. Some derive it from ktm, catham, [302] as if it were a golden
   crest or jewel. Others think it is the beginning of a song, which at
   that time was very common. To others it seems rather to be some kind of
   tune, and this opinion I am inclined to adopt.

   Psalm 16:1

   1. Keep [or guard [303] ] me, O God; for in thee do I trust. [304]


   This is a prayer in which David commits himself to the protection of
   God. He does not, however, here implore the aid of God, in some
   particular emergency, as he often does in other psalms, but he
   beseeches him to show himself his protector during the whole course of
   his life, and indeed our safety both in life and in death depends
   entirely upon our being under the protection of God. What follows
   concerning trust, signifies much the same thing as if the Holy Spirit
   assured us by the mouth of David, that God is ready to succor all of
   us, provided we rely upon him with a sure and steadfast faith; and that
   he takes under his protection none but those who commit themselves to
   him with their whole heart. At the same time, we must be reminded that
   David, supported by this trust, continued firm and unmoved amidst all
   the storms of adversity with which he was buffeted.

   Psalm 16:2-3

   2. Thou shalt say unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord, my well-doing
   extendeth not unto thee. 3. Unto the saints who are on the earth, and
   to the excellent; all my delight is in them.


   2. Thou shalt say unto Jehovah. David begins by stating that he can
   bestow nothing upon God, not only because God stands in no need of any
   thing, but also because mortal man cannot merit the favor of God by any
   service which he can perform to him. At the same time, however, he
   takes courage, and, as God accepts our devotion, and the service which
   we yield to him, David protests that he will be one of his servants. To
   encourage himself the more effectually to this duty he speaks to his
   own soul; for the Hebrew word which is rendered Thou shalt say, is of
   the feminine gender, which can refer only to the soul. [305] Some may
   prefer reading the word in the past tense, Thou hast said, which I
   think is unobjectionable, for the Psalmist is speaking of an affliction
   which had a continued abode in his soul. The import of his language is,
   I am, indeed, fully convinced in my heart, and know assuredly, that God
   can derive no profit or advantage from me; but notwithstanding this, I
   will join myself in fellowship with the saints, that with one accord we
   may worship him by the sacrifices of praise. Two things are distinctly
   laid down in this verse. The first is, that God has a right to require
   of us whatever he pleases, seeing we are wholly bound to Him as our
   rightful proprietor and Lord. David, by ascribing to him the power and
   the dominion of Lord, declares that both himself and all he possessed
   are the property of God. The other particular contained in this verse
   is, the acknowledgement which the Psalmist makes of his own indigence.
   My well-doing extendeth not unto thee. Interpreters expound this last
   clause in two ways. As lyk, aleyka, may be rendered upon thee, some
   draw from it this sense, that God is not brought under obligation, or
   in the least degree indebted to us, by any good deeds which we may
   perform to him; and they understand the term goodness in a passive
   sense, as if David affirmed that whatever goodness he received from God
   did not proceed from any obligation he had laid God under, or from any
   merit which he possessed. But I think the sentence has a more extensive
   meaning, namely, that let men strive ever so much to lay themselves out
   for God, yet they can bring no advantage to him. Our goodness extendeth
   not to him, not only because, having in himself alone an
   all-sufficiency, he stands in need of nothing, [306] but also because
   we are empty and destitute of all good things, and have nothing with
   which to show ourselves liberal towards him. From this doctrine,
   however, the other point which I have before touched upon will follow,
   namely, that it is impossible for men, by any merits of their own, to
   bring God under obligation to them, so as to make him their debtor. The
   sum of the discourse is, that when we come before God, we must lay
   aside all presumption. When we imagine that there is any good thing in
   us, we need not wonder if he reject us, as we thus take away from him a
   principal part of the honor which is his due. But, on the contrary, if
   we acknowledge that all the services which we can yield him are in
   themselves things of nought, and undeserving of any recompense, this
   humility is as a perfume of a sweet odour, which will procure for them
   acceptance with God.

   3. Unto the saints who are on the earth. Almost all are agreed in
   understanding this place, as if David, after the sentence which we have
   just now been considering, had added, The only way of serving God
   aright is to endeavor to do good to his holy servants. And the truth
   is, that God, as our good deeds cannot extend to him, substitutes the
   saints in his place, towards whom we are to exercise our charity. When
   men, therefore, mutually exert themselves in doing good to one another,
   this is to yield to God right and acceptable service. We ought,
   doubtless, to extend our charity even to those who are unworthy of it,
   as our heavenly Father

   "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," (Matthew 5:45;)

   but David justly prefers the saints to others, and places them in a
   higher rank. This, then, as I have said in the commencement, is the
   common opinion of almost all interpreters. [307] But although I do not
   deny that this doctrine is comprehended under the words of David, I
   think he goes somewhat farther, and intimates that he will unite
   himself with the devout worshippers of God, and be their associate or
   companion; even as all the children of God ought to be joined together
   by the bond of fraternal unity, that they may all serve and call upon
   their common Father with the same affection and zeal. [308] We thus see
   that David, after having confessed that he can find nothing in himself
   to bring to God, seeing he is indebted to him for every thing which he
   has, sets his affections upon the saints, because it is the will of God
   that, in this world, he should be magnified and exalted in the assembly
   of the just, whom he has adopted into his family for this end, that
   they may live together with one accord under his authority, and under
   the guidance of his Holy Spirit. This passage, therefore, teaches us
   that there is no sacrifice more acceptable to God than when we
   sincerely and heartily connect ourselves with the society of the
   righteous, and being knit together by the sacred bond of godliness,
   cultivate and maintain with them brotherly good-will. In this consists
   the communion of saints which separates them from the degrading
   pollutions of the world, that they may be the holy and peculiar people
   of God. He expressly speaks of the saints who are on the earth, because
   it is the will of God that, even in this world, there should be
   conspicuous marks, and as it were visible escutcheons, [309] of his
   glory, which may serve to conduct us to himself. The faithful,
   therefore, bear his image, that, by their example, we may be stirred up
   to meditation upon the heavenly life. For the same reason, the Psalmist
   calls them excellent, or honorable, because there is nothing which
   ought to be more precious to us than righteousness and holiness, in
   which the brightness of God's Spirit shines forth; just as we are
   commanded in the preceding psalm to prize and honor those who fear God.
   We ought, therefore, highly to value and esteem the true and devoted
   servants of God, and to regard nothing as of greater importance than to
   connect ourselves with their society; and this we will actually do if
   we wisely reflect in what true excellence and dignity consist, and do
   not allow the vain splendor of the world and its deceitful pomps to
   dazzle our eyes.

   Psalm 16:4

   4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied who offer to a stranger. [310] I
   will not taste [311] their libations [312] of blood, nor will I take
   their names in my lips.


   The Psalmist now describes the true way of maintaining brotherly
   concord with the saints, by declaring that he will have nothing to do
   with unbelievers and the superstitious. We cannot be united into the
   one body of the Church under God, if we do not break off all the bonds
   of impiety, separate ourselves from idolaters, and keep ourselves pure
   and at a distance from all the pollutions which corrupt and vitiate the
   holy service of God. This is certainly the general drift of David's
   discourse. But as to the words there is a diversity of opinion among
   expositors. Some translate the first word of the verse tsvvt, atsboth,
   by idols, [313] and according to this rendering the meaning is, that
   after men in their folly have once begun to make to themselves false
   gods, their madness breaks forth without measure, until they accumulate
   an immense multitude of deities. As, however, this word is here put in
   the feminine gender, I prefer translating it sorrows or troubles,
   although it may still have various meanings. Some think it is an
   imprecation, and they read, Let their sorrows be multiplied; as if
   David, inflamed with a holy zeal, denounced the just vengeance of God
   against the superstitious. Others, whose opinions I prefer, do not
   change the tense of the verb, which in the Hebrew is future, Their
   sorrows shall be multiplied; but to me they do not seem to express,
   with sufficient clearness, what kind of sorrows David intends. They
   say, indeed, that wretched idolaters are perpetually adding to their
   new inventions, in doing which, they miserably torment themselves. But
   I am of opinion, that by this word there is, at the same time, denoted
   the end and issue of the pains which they take in committing it; it
   points out that they not only put themselves to trouble without any
   profit or advantage, but also miserably harass and busy themselves to
   accomplish their own destruction. As an incitement to him to withdraw
   himself farther from their company, he takes this as an
   incontrovertible principle, that, so far from deriving any advantage
   from their vain superstitions, they only, by their strenuous efforts in
   practising them, involve themselves in greater misery and wretchedness.
   For what must be the issue with respect to those miserable men who
   willingly surrender themselves as bond-slaves to the devil, but to be
   disappointed of their hope? even as God complains in Jeremiah,
   (Jeremiah 2:13,)

   "They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them
   out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water."

   In the next clause there is also some ambiguity. The Hebrew word mhr,
   mahar, which we have translated to offer, in the conjugation kal
   signifies to endow, or to give. But as, in the conjugation hiphil, it
   is more frequently taken for to run, or to make haste, [314] many have
   preferred this latter meaning, and interpret the clause thus, that
   superstitious persons eagerly hasten after strange gods. And in fact we
   see them rushing into their idolatries with all the impetuosity and
   recklessness of madmen running in the fields; [315] and the prophets
   often upbraid them for this inconsiderate frenzy with which they are
   fired. I would, therefore, be much disposed to adopt this sense were it
   supported by the common usage of the language; but as grammarians
   observe that there is not to be found another similar passage in
   Scripture, I have followed, in my translation, the first opinion. In
   short, the sum of what the Psalmist says is this, That unbelievers, who
   lavish and squander away their substance upon their idols, not only
   lose all the gifts and offerings which they present to them, but also,
   by provoking the wrath of God against themselves, are continually
   increasing the amount of their miseries. Perhaps, also, the prophet has
   an allusion to the common doctrine of Scripture, that idolaters violate
   the promise of the spiritual marriage contracted with the true God, and
   enter into covenant with idols. [316] Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:33) justly
   upbraids the Jews, in that while the custom is for the lover to allure
   the harlot with presents, they, on the contrary, offered rewards to the
   idols to whom they prostituted and abandoned themselves. But the
   meaning which we have above given brings out the spirit of the passage,
   namely, that unbelievers, who honor their false gods by offering to
   them gifts, not only lose what is thus expended, but also heap up for
   themselves sorrows upon sorrows, because at last the issue will be
   miserable and ruinous to them.

   I will not taste their libations of blood. By libations of blood some
   understand that there is a reference to sacrifices made of things
   acquired by murder or rapine. As, however, the prophet is not here
   inveighing against cruel and bloodthirsty men, but condemns, in
   general, all false and corrupt religious worship; and again, as he does
   not directly name sacrifices, but expressly speaks of the ceremony of
   taking the cup, and tasting a little of it, which was observed in
   offering sacrifices, [317] I have no doubt but that to this ceremony,
   as it was observed according to the law of God, he here tacitly opposes
   the drinking of blood in heathen sacrifices. We know that God, in order
   to teach his ancient people to hold in greater abhorrence murder and
   all cruelty, forbade them to eat or to drink blood either in their
   common food or in sacrifices. On the contrary, the histories of the
   heathen nations bear testimony that the custom of tasting the blood in
   their sacrifices prevailed among them. David, therefore, protests, that
   he will not only keep himself uncontaminated by the corrupt and false
   opinions by which idolaters are seduced, but that he will also take
   care not to show outwardly any token of his complying with or approving
   them. In the same sense we are to understand what follows immediately
   after, I will not take their names in my lips. This implies that he
   will hold idols in such hatred and detestation, as to keep himself from
   naming them as from execrable treason against the majesty of heaven.
   Not that it is unlawful to pronounce their names, which we frequently
   meet with in the writings of the prophets, but David felt he could not
   otherwise more forcibly express the supreme horror and detestation with
   which the faithful ought to regard false gods. This is also shown by
   the form of expression which he employs, using the relative only, their
   names, although he has not expressly stated before that he is speaking
   of idols. Thus, by his example, he enjoins believers not only to beware
   of errors and wicked opinions, but also to abstain from all appearance
   of giving their consent to them. He evidently speaks of external
   ceremonies, which indicate either the true religion, or some perverse
   superstition. If, then, it is unlawful for the faithful to show any
   token of consenting to or complying with the superstitions of
   idolaters, Nicodemuses (who falsely call themselves by this name [318]
   ) must not think to shelter themselves under the frivolous pretext that
   they have not renounced the faith, but keep it hidden within their
   hearts, when they join in the observance of the profane superstitions
   of the Papists. Some understand the words strangers and their names, as
   denoting the worshippers of false gods; but in my judgment David rather
   means the false gods themselves. The scope of his discourse is this:
   The earth is filled with an immense accumulation [319] of superstitions
   in every possible variety, and idolaters are lavish beyond all bounds
   in ornamenting their idols; but the good and the holy will ever regard
   all their superstitious inventions with abhorrence.

   "gousteray," which means simply to taste. "The Gentiles used." Says
   Poole, ("as diverse learned men have observed,) to offer, and sometimes

   [312] In the French version, the word is "sacrifices," on which Calvin
   has the following note on the margin:-- "Le mot signifie proprement

   the customary drinks in sacrifices."

   [313] The Chaldee version reads, "their idols." The Septuagint reads,
   astheneiai auton, "their weaknesses," or" afflictions;" and the Syriac
   and Arabic use a word of similar import. Bishop Patrick paraphrases the
   verse as follows: -- "They multiply idols, (here in this place whither
   I am driven, 1 Samuel 26:19,) and are zealous in the service of another
   God. But I will never forsake thee by partaking with them in their
   abominable sacrifices, (in which the blood of men is offered,) nor by
   swearing by the name of any of their false gods." "Dathe observes, that
   tsvvt, never signifies idols, the proper word being tsvym. See Gesenius

   Polyglott support the common interpretation, which is also approved by
   Dathe, Horsley, Berlin, and De Rossi." -- Roger's Book of Psalms, in
   Hebrew, Metrically Arranged; vol. 2, p. 172.

   [314] Walford translates the verse thus:-- "They multiply their sorrows
   who hastily turn backward;
   Their libations of blood will I not offer;
   Nor will I take their names upon my lips." And the sense which he
   attaches to the passage is, that David having in the preceding verse
   declared his delight in the righteous, here states that those who turn
   away from God and his truth augment their own sufferings; and affirms
   it to be his resolution to have no fellowship with them in their
   religious services, which were polluted and detestable, or in the
   intercourse of friendship by making mention of their names.

   Psalm 16:5-6

   5. Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; thou
   sustainest my lot. 6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places;
   yea, I have a goodly heritage.


   5. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance. Here the Psalmist
   explains his sentiments more clearly. He shows the reason why he
   separates himself from idolaters, and resolves to continue in the
   church of God, why he shuns, with abhorrence, all participation in
   their errors, and cleaves to the pure worship of God; namely, because
   he rests in the only true God as his portion. The unhappy restlessness
   of those blind idolaters [320] whom we see going astray, and running
   about as if stricken and impelled by madness, is doubtless to be traced
   to their destitution of the true knowledge of God. All who have not
   their foundation and trust in God must necessarily be often in a state
   of irresolution and uncertainty; and those who do not hold the true
   faith in such a manner as to be guided and governed by it, must be
   often carried away by the overflowing floods of errors which prevail in
   the world. [321] This passage teaches us, that none are taught aright
   in true godliness but those who reckon God alone sufficient for their
   happiness. David, by calling God the portion of his lot, and his
   inheritance, and his cup, protests that he is so fully satisfied with
   him alone, as neither to covet any thing besides him, nor to be excited
   by any depraved desires. Let us therefore learn, when God offers
   himself to us, to embrace him with the whole heart, and to seek in him
   only all the ingredients and the fullness of our happiness. All the
   superstitions which have ever prevailed in the world have undoubtedly
   proceeded from this source, that superstitious men have not been
   contented with possessing God alone. But we do not actually possess him
   unless "he is the portion of our inheritance;" in other words, unless
   we are wholly devoted to him, so as no longer to have any desire
   unfaithfully to depart from him. For this reason, God, when he upbraids
   the Jews who had wandered from him as apostates, [322] with having run
   about after idols, addresses them thus, "Let them be thine inheritance,
   and thy portion." By these words he shows, that if we do not reckon him
   alone an all-sufficient portion for us, and if we will have idols along
   with him, [323] he gives place entirely to them, and lets them have the
   full possession of our hearts. David here employs three metaphors; he
   first compares God to an inheritance; secondly, to a cup; and, thirdly,
   he represents him as He who defends and keeps him in possession of his
   inheritance. By the first metaphor he alludes to the heritages of the
   land of Canaan, which we know were divided among the Jews by divine
   appointment, and the law commanded every one to be content with the
   portion which had fallen to him. By the word cup is denoted either the
   revenue of his own proper inheritance, or by synecdoche, ordinary food
   by which life is sustained, seeing drink is a part of our nourishment.
   [324] It is as if David had said, God is mine both in respect of
   property and enjoyment. Nor is the third comparison superfluous. It
   often happens that rightful owners are put out of their possession
   because no one defends them. But while God has given himself to us for
   an inheritance, he has engaged to exercise his power in maintaining us
   in the safe enjoyment of a good so inconceivably great. It would be of
   little advantage to us to have once obtained him as ours, if he did not
   secure our possession of him against the assaults which Satan daily
   makes upon us. Some explain the third clause as if it had been said,
   Thou art my ground in which my portion is situated; but this sense
   appears to me to be cold and unsatisfactory.

   6. The lines [325] have fallen to me. The Psalmist confirms more fully
   what he had already said in the preceding verse with respect to his
   resting, with a composed and tranquil mind, in God alone; or rather, he
   so glories in God as nobly to despise all that the world imagines to be
   excellent and desirable without him. By magnifying God in such
   honorable and exalted strains, he gives us to understand that he does
   not desire any thing more as his portion and felicity. This doctrine
   may be profitable to us in many ways. It ought to draw us away not only
   from all the perverse inventions of superstition, but also from all the
   allurements of the flesh and of the world. Whenever, therefore, those
   things present themselves to us which would lead us away from resting
   in God alone, let us make use of this sentiment as an antidote against
   them, that we have sufficient cause for being contented, since he who
   has in himself an absolute fullness of all good has given himself to be
   enjoyed by us. In this way we will experience our condition to be
   always pleasant and comfortable; for he who has God as his portion is
   destitute of nothing which is requisite to constitute a happy life.

   Psalm 16:7

   7. I will magnify Jehovah, who giveth me counsel; even in the night my
   reins instruct me. [326]


   Last of all, David confesses that it was entirely owing to the pure
   grace of God that he had come to possess so great a good, and that he
   had been made a partaker of it by faith. It would be of no advantage to
   us for God to offer himself freely and graciously to us, if we did not
   receive him by faith, seeing he invites to himself both the reprobate
   and the elect in common; but the former, by their ingratitude, defraud
   themselves of this inestimable blessing. Let us, therefore, know that
   both these things proceed from the free liberality of God; first, his
   being our inheritance, and next, our coming to the possession of him by
   faith. The counsel of which David makes mention is the inward
   illumination of the Holy Spirit, by which we are prevented from
   rejecting the salvation to which he calls us, which we would otherwise
   certainly do, considering the blindness of our flesh. [327] Whence we
   gather, that those who attribute to the free will of man the choice of
   accepting or rejecting the grace of God basely mangle that grace, and
   show as much ignorance as impiety. That this discourse of David ought
   not to be understood of external teaching appears clearly from the
   words, for he tells us that he was instructed in the night when he was
   removed from the sight of men. Again, when he speaks of this being done
   in his reins, he doubtless means secret inspirations. [328] Farther, it
   ought to be carefully observed, that, in speaking of the time when he
   was instructed, he uses the plural number, saying, it was done in the
   nights. By this manner of speaking, he not only ascribes to God the
   beginning of faith, but acknowledges that he is continually making
   progress under his tuition; and, indeed, it is necessary for God,
   during the whole of our life, to continue to correct the vanity of our
   minds, to kindle the light of faith into a brighter flame, and by every
   means to advance us higher in the attainments of spiritual wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [326] "My reins" is the literal rendering of the Hebrew text, and they
   denote the working of the thoughts and affections of the soul. "Common
   experience," says Parkhurst, "shows that the workings of the mind,
   particularly the passions of joy, grief, and fear, have a very,
   remarkable effect on the reins or kidneys, so, from their retired
   situation in the body, and their being hid in fat, they are often used
   in Scripture to denote the most secret working of the soul and
   affections" "The reins or kidneys," says Walford, in a note on this
   passage, "are used to signify the interior faculties; and the divine
   speaker observes, that in seasons of solitude, his thoughts were
   instinctively employed in contemplating the heavenly discoveries that
   were communicated to him." In Tyndale's Bible the reading of the last
   clause is, "My reins also have chastened me in the night season." And
   Fry observes, that the word ysr, signifies not so immediately to
   instruct, as to chasten, correct, or discipline.

   [327] "Ce qu'autrement nous ferions, veu l'aveuglement de nostre
   chair." -- Fr.

   [328] Calvin means that God taught David by secret inspirations.

   Psalm 16:8-9

   8. I have set Jehovah continually before me; because he is at my right
   hand, I shall not be moved. 9. Therefore my heart [329] is glad, my
   tongue rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in confidence, [or in
   security.]


   8. I have set Jehovah, etc. The Psalmist again shows the firmness and
   stability of his faith. To set God before us is nothing else than to
   keep all our senses bound and captive, that they may not run out and go
   astray after any other object. We must look to him with other eyes than
   those of the flesh, for we shall seldom be able to perceive him unless
   we elevate our minds above the world; and faith prevents us from
   turning our back upon him. The meaning, therefore, is, that David kept
   his mind so intently fixed upon the providence of God, as to be fully
   persuaded, that whenever any difficulty or distress should befall him,
   God would be always at hand to assist him. He adds, also, continually,
   to show us how he constantly depended upon the assistance of God, so
   that, amidst the various conflicts with which he was agitated, no fear
   of danger could make him turn his eyes to any other quarter than to God
   in search of succor. And thus we ought so to depend upon God as to
   continue to be fully persuaded of his being near to us, even when he
   seems to be removed to the greatest distance from us. When we shall
   have thus turned our eyes towards him, the masks and the vain illusions
   of this world will no longer deceive us.

   Because he is at my right hand. I read this second clause as a distinct
   sentence from the preceding. To connect them together as some do in
   this way, I have set the Lord continually before me, because he is at
   my right hand, would give a meagre meaning to the words, and take away
   much of the truth which is taught in them, as it would make David to
   say, that he measured God's presence according to the experience he had
   of it; a mode of speaking which would not be at all becoming. I
   consider, therefore, the words, I have set the Lord continually before
   me, as a complete sentence, and David set the Lord before him for the
   purpose of constantly repairing to him in all his dangers. For his
   greater encouragement to hope well, he sets before himself what it is
   to have God's assistance and fatherly care, namely, that it implies his
   keeping firm and unmoved his own people with whom he is present. David
   then reckons himself secure against all dangers, and promises himself
   certain safety, because, with the eyes of faith, he beholds God as
   present with him. From this passage we are furnished with an argument
   which overthrows the fabrication of the Sorbonists, [330] that the
   faithful are in doubt with respect to their final perseverance; for
   David, in very plain terms, extends his reliance on the grace of God to
   the time to come. And, certainly, it would be a very miserable
   condition to be in, to tremble in uncertainty every moment, having no
   assurance of the continuance of the grace of God towards us.

   9. Therefore my heart is glad. In this verse the Psalmist commends the
   inestimable fruit of faith, of which Scripture every where makes
   mention, in that, by placing us under the protection of God, it makes
   us not only to live in the enjoyment of mental tranquillity, but, what
   is more, to live joyful and cheerful. The principal, the essential part
   of a happy life, as we know, is to possess tranquillity of conscience
   and of mind; as, on the contrary, there is no greater infelicity than
   to be tossed amidst a multiplicity of cares and fears.

   But the ungodly, however much intoxicated with the spirit of
   thoughtlessness or stupidity, never experience true joy or serene
   mental peace; they rather feel terrible agitations within, which often
   come upon them and trouble them, so much as to constrain them to awake
   from their lethargy. In short, calmly to rejoice is the lot of no man
   but of him who has learned to place his confidence in God alone, and to
   commit his life and safety to his protection. When, therefore,
   encompassed with innumerable troubles on all sides, let us be
   persuaded, that the only remedy is to direct our eyes towards God; and
   if we do this, faith will not only tranquillise our minds, but also
   replenish them with fullness of joy. David, however, not only affirms
   that he is glad inwardly; he also makes his tongue, yea, even his
   flesh, sharers of this joy. And not without cause, for true believers
   not only have this spiritual joy in the secret affection of their
   heart, but also manifest it by the tongue, inasmuch as they glory in
   God as He who protects them and secures their salvation. The word kvvd,
   kabod, properly signifies glory and excellence. I have, however, no
   doubt of its being here taken for the tongue, [331] as it is in Genesis
   49:6; for otherwise the division which is obviously made in this verse
   of the person into three parts is not so distinct and evident. Farther,
   although the body is not free from inconveniences and troubles, yet as
   God defends and maintains not only our souls, but also our bodies,
   David does not speak groundlessly when he represents the blessing of
   dwelling in safety as extending to his flesh in common with his soul.

   Psalm 16:10

   10. For thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave; neither wilt thou
   make thy Holy One to see the pit. [332]


   The Psalmist goes on to explain still more fully the preceding
   doctrine, by declaring that as he is not afraid of death, there is
   nothing wanting which is requisite to the completion of his joy. Whence
   it follows, that no one truly trusts in God but he who takes such hold
   of the salvation which God has promised him as to despise death.
   Moreover, it is to be observed, that David's language is not to be
   limited to some particular kind of deliverance, as in Psalm 49:15,
   where he says, "God hath redeemed my soul from the power of the grave,"
   and in other similar passages; but he entertains the undoubted
   assurance of eternal salvation, which freed him from all anxiety and
   fear. It is as if he had said, There will always be ready for me a way
   of escape from the grave, that I may not remain in corruption. God, in
   delivering his people from any danger, prolongs their life only for a
   short time; but how slender and how empty a consolation would it be to
   obtain some brief respite, and to take breath for a short time, until
   death, coming at last, should terminate the course of our life, [333]
   and swallow us up without any hope of deliverance? Hence it appears
   that when David spake thus, he raised his mind above the common lot of
   mankind. As the sentence has been pronounced upon all the children of
   Adam, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return," (Genesis 3:19,)
   the same condition in this respect awaits them all without exception.
   If, therefore, Christ, who is the first-fruits of those who rise again,
   does not come forth from the grave, they will remain for ever under the
   bondage of corruption. From this Peter justly concludes, (Acts 2:30,)
   that David could not have gloried in this manner but by the spirit of
   prophecy; and unless he had had a special respect to the Author of
   life, who was promised to him, who alone was to be honored with this
   privilege in its fullest sense. This, however, did not prevent David
   from assuring himself of exemption from the dominion of death by right,
   seeing Christ, by his rising from the dead, obtained immortality not
   for himself individually, but for us all. As to the point, that Peter
   (Acts 2:30) and Paul (Acts 13:33) contend that this prophecy was
   fulfilled in the person of Christ alone, [334] the sense in which we
   must understand them is this, that he was wholly and perfectly exempted
   from the corruption of the grave, that he might call his members into
   his fellowship, and make them partakers of this blessing, [335]
   although by degrees, and each according to his measure. As the body of
   David, after death, was, in the course of time, reduced to dust, the
   apostles justly conclude that he was not exempted from corruption. It
   is the same with respect to all the faithful, not one of whom becomes a
   partaker of incorruptible life without being first subjected to
   corruption. From this it follows that the fullness of life which
   resides in the head alone, namely, in Christ, falls down upon the
   members only in drops, or in small portions. The question, however, may
   be asked, as Christ descended into the grave, was not he also subject
   to corruption? The answer is easy. The etymology or derivation of the
   two words here used to express the grave should be carefully attended
   to. The grave is called s'vl, sheol, being as it were an insatiable
   gulf, which devours and consumes all things, and the pit is called
   scht, shachath, which signifies corruption. These words, therefore,
   here denote not so much the place as the quality and condition of the
   place, as if it had been said, The life of Christ will be exempted from
   the dominion of the grave, inasmuch as his body, even when dead, will
   not be subject to corruption. Besides, we know that the grave of Christ
   was filled, and as it were embalmed with the life-giving perfume of his
   Spirit, that it might be to him the gate to immortal glory. Both the
   Greek and Latin Fathers, I confess, have strained these words to a
   meaning wholly different, referring them to the bringing back of the
   soul of Christ from hell. But it is better to adhere to the natural
   simplicity of the interpretation which I have given, that we may not
   make ourselves objects of ridicule, to the Jews; and farther, that one
   subtilty, by engendering many others, may not involve us in a
   labyrinth. In the second clause mention is without doubt made of the
   body; and we know it to be a mode of speaking very common with David
   intentionally to repeat the same thing twice, making a slight variation
   as to words. It is true, we translate nphs, nephesh, by soul, but in
   Hebrew it only signifies the vital breath, or life itself
     __________________________________________________________________

   [332] "The Hebrew word shachath," says Poole, "though sometimes, by a
   metonymy, it signifies the pit or place of corruption, yet properly and
   generally it signifies corruption or perdition. And so it must be
   understood here, although some of the Jews, to avoid the force of this
   argument, render it the pit. But in that sense it is not true, for
   whether it be meant of David, as they say, or of Christ, it is
   confessed that both of them did see the pit, that is, were laid in the
   grave." Hence he concludes that corruption is the proper rendering of
   the original word. The phrase, however, to see the pit, may not mean to
   be laid in the grave, but to continue in it for any length of time. The
   meaning which Calvin attaches to the word pit is substantially that
   which our English translators attached to the original word which they
   render corruption. Hengstenberg adopts and defends Calvin's rendering.

   [333] "Jusqu'a ce que la mort finalement venant, rompist le cours de
   nos jours." -- Fr.

   [334] Thus we have the authority of two apostles for understanding the
   concluding part of this psalm as a prophecy of Christ's resurrection
   from the dead.

   [335] "Et les faire venir a la participation de ce bien." -- Fr.

   Psalm 16:11

   11. Thou wilt make me to know the path of life; fullness of joy is in
   thy countenance, pleasures are at thy right hand for evermore.


   The Psalmist confirms the statement made in the preceding verse, and
   explains the way in which God will exempt him from the bondage of
   death, namely, by conducting and bringing him at length safely to the
   possession of eternal life. Whence we again learn what I have already
   observed, that this passage touches upon the difference which there is
   between true believers and aliens, or reprobates, with respect to their
   everlasting state. It is a mere cavil to say, that when David here
   speaks of the path of life being shown to him, it means the
   prolongation of his natural life. It is to form a very low estimate,
   indeed, of the grace of God to speak of him as a guide to his people in
   the path of life only for a very few years in this world. In this case,
   they would differ nothing from the reprobate, who enjoy the light of
   the sun in common with them. If, therefore, it is the special grace of
   God which he communicates to none but his own children, that David here
   magnifies and exalts, the showing of the way of life, of which he
   speaks, must undoubtedly be viewed as extending to a blessed
   immortality; and, indeed, he only knows the way of life who is so
   united to God that he lives in God, and cannot live without him.

   David next adds, that when God is reconciled to us, we have all things
   which are necessary to perfect happiness. The phrase, the countenance
   of God, may be understood either of our being beheld by him, or of our
   beholding him; but I consider both these ideas as included, for his
   fatherly favor, which he displays in looking upon us with a serene
   countenance, precedes this joy, and is the first cause of it, and yet
   this does not cheer us until, on our part, we behold it shining upon
   us. By this clause David also intended distinctly to express to whom
   those pleasures belong, of which God has in his hand a full and an
   overflowing abundance. As there are with God pleasures sufficient to
   replenish and satisfy the whole world, whence comes it to pass that a
   dismal and deadly darkness envelopes the greater part of mankind, but
   because God does not look upon all men equally with his friendly and
   fatherly countenance, nor opens the eyes of all men to seek the matter
   of their joy in him, and no where else? Fulness of joy is contrasted
   with the evanescent allurements and pleasures of this transitory world,
   which, after having diverted their miserable votaries for a time, leave
   them at length unsatisfied, famished, and disappointed. They may
   intoxicate and glut themselves with pleasures to the greatest excess,
   but, instead of being satisfied, they rather become wearied of them
   through loathing; and, besides, the pleasures of this world vanish away
   like dreams. David, therefore, testifies that true and solid joy in
   which the minds of men may rest will never be found any where else but
   in God; and that, therefore, none but the faithful, who are contented
   with his grace alone, can be truly and perfectly happy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [302] The word means gold, the finest gold, and those who understand it
   in this sense here, think the psalm receives this title to denote that
   it is fit to be written in letters of gold; and some conjecture that
   the psalms distinguished by this title were, on some occasion or other,
   thus written and hung up in the sanctuary. Others are of opinion that
   the word mictam is derived from ktm, catham, which signifies to mark,
   to engrave, to denote that the psalm is fit to be engraven on a
   valuable and durable pillar, to be preserved in everlasting
   remembrance. This is the meaning attached to the word by the
   Septuagint, which translates it stelographia, an inscription on a
   pillar or monument. In either of these views the title cannot but be
   regarded as peculiarly appropriate to this sacred poem. "As a
   sepulchral inscription," remarks Bishop Mant, "it might have been
   written on our Redeemer's tomb; as a triumphal monument, it might have
   been sung by him in the region of departed spirits; and in either, or
   in any sense, it may well be considered as a golden composition, as
   apples of gold in network of which occur in the titles of the psalms,
   are the names of old melodies.

   PSALM 17.

   This psalm contains a mournful complaint against the cruel pride of
   David's enemies. He protests that he did not deserve to be persecuted
   with such inhumanity, inasmuch as he had given them no cause for
   exercising their cruelty against him. At the same time, he beseeches
   God, as his protector, to put forth his power for his deliverance. The
   inscription of the psalm does not refer to any particular time, but it
   is probable that David here complains of Saul and his associates. [336]

   A prayer of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 17:1-2

   1. Hear my righteousness, [337] O Jehovah, attend to my cry; hearken to
   my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips. 2. Let my judgment
   [or judgment in my favor] come forth from the presence of thy
   countenance; [338] let thine eyes look upon my uprightness.


   1. Hear my righteousness, O Jehovah. The Psalmist begins the psalm by
   setting forth the goodness of his cause. He does this because God has
   promised that he will not suffer the innocent to be oppressed, but will
   always, at length, succor them. Some explain the word righteousness as
   denoting righteous prayer, an interpretation which appears to me
   unsatisfactory. The meaning rather is, that David, confiding in his own
   integrity, interposes God as a Judge between himself and his enemies,
   to cognosce or determine in his cause. We have already seen, in a
   preceding psalm, that when we have to deal with wicked men, we may
   warrantably protest our innocence before God. As, however, it would not
   be enough for the faithful to have the approving testimony of a good
   conscience, David adds to his protestation earnest prayer. Even
   irreligious persons may often be able justly to boast of having a good
   cause; but as they do not acknowledge that the world is governed by the
   providence of God, they content themselves with enjoying the
   approbation of their own conscience, as they speak, and, gnawing the
   bit, bear the injuries which are done to them rather obstinately than
   steadfastly, seeing they do not seek for any consolation in faith and
   prayer. But the faithful not only depend upon the goodness of their
   cause, they also commit it to God that he may defend and maintain it;
   and whenever any adversity befalls them, they betake themselves to him
   for help. This, therefore, is the meaning of the passage; it is a
   prayer that God, who knew David to have done justly, and to have
   performed his duty without giving occasion to any to blame him, [339]
   and, therefore, to be unrighteously molested by his enemies, would
   graciously look upon him; and that he would do this especially, since,
   confiding in his aid, he entertained good hope, and, at the same time,
   prays to him with a sincere heart. By the words cry and prayer he means
   the same thing; but the word cry, and the repetition of what it
   denotes, by a different expression, serve to show his vehement, his
   intense earnestness of soul. Farther, as hypocrites talk loftily in
   commendation of themselves, and to show to others a token of the great
   confidence which they have in God, give utterance to loud cries, David
   protests concerning himself that he does not speak deceitfully; in
   other words, that he does not make use of his crying and prayer as a
   pretext for covering his sins, but comes into the presence of God with
   sincerity of heart. By this form of prayer the Holy Spirit teaches us,
   that we ought diligently to endeavor to live an upright and innocent
   life, so that, if there are any who give us trouble, we may be able to
   boast that we are blamed and persecuted wrongfully. [340] Again,
   whenever the wicked assault us, the same Spirit calls upon us to engage
   in prayer; and if any man, trusting to the testimony of a good
   conscience which he enjoys, neglects the exercise of prayer, he
   defrauds God of the honor which belongs to him, in not referring his
   cause to him, and in not leaving him to judge and determine in it. Let
   us learn, also, that when we present ourselves before God in prayer, it
   is not to be done with the ornaments of an artificial eloquence, for
   the finest rhetoric and the best grace which we can have before him
   consists in pure simplicity.

   2. From the presence of thy countenance. Literally it is, from before
   thy face, or, before thy face. By these words David intimates that if
   God does not rise up as the vindicator of his cause, he will be
   overwhelmed with calumnies though innocent, and will be looked upon as
   a guilty and condemned person. The cognisance which God will take of
   his cause is tacitly set in opposition to the dark inventions of
   falsehood which were spread against him. [341] His language is as if he
   had said, I do not ask for any other judge but God, nor do I shrink
   from standing before his judgment-seat, [342] since I bring with me
   both a pure heart and a good cause. What he immediately adds with
   respect to God's looking upon his uprightness is of similar import. He
   does not mean to say that God is blind, but only beseeches him actually
   to show that he does not connive at the wickedness of men, and that it
   is not to him a matter of indifference when he beholds those who have
   not the means of defending themselves [343] receiving evil treatment
   undeservedly. Some take the word judgment in too restricted a sense for
   the right to the kingdom which was promised to David, as if he
   petitioned to be placed on the royal throne by the power of God,
   inasmuch as he had been chosen by him to be king, and had also, in his
   name and by his authority, been anointed to this office by the hand of
   Samuel. The meaning which I attach to David's language is simply this,
   that being oppressed with many and varied wrongs, he commits himself to
   the protection and defense of God.

   Psalm 17:3-4

   3. Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited it by night; thou hast
   examined it, thou shalt find nothing; my thoughts shall not pass beyond
   my mouth. [344] 4. As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I
   have taken heed of [or watched] the ways of the destroyer. [345]


   3. Thou hast proved my heart. Some are of opinion that in the three
   first verbs the past tense is put for the future. Others more correctly
   and more clearly resolve the words thus: If thou provest my heart, and
   visitest it by night, and examinest it thoroughly, there will not be
   found any deceit therein. But without making any change upon the words,
   they may be suitably enough explained in this way: Thou, Lord, who
   understandest all the secret affections and thoughts of my heart, even
   as it is thy peculiar prerogative to try men, knowest very well that I
   am not a double man, and do not cherish any deceit within. What David
   intended to express is certainly very evident. As he was unjustly and
   falsely charged with crime, and could obtain neither justice nor
   humanity at the hands of men, he appeals to God, requesting he would
   become judge in the matter. [346] But not to do this rashly, he
   subjects himself to an impartial examination, seeing God, whose
   prerogative it is to search the secret recesses of the heart, cannot be
   deceived by the external appearance. The time when he declares God to
   have visited him is during the night, because, when a man is withdrawn
   from the presence of his fellow-creatures, he sees more clearly his
   sins, which otherwise would be hidden from his view; just as, on the
   contrary, the sight of men affects us with shame, and this is, as it
   were, a veil before our eyes, which prevents us from deliberately
   examining our faults. It is, therefore, as if David had said, O Lord,
   since the darkness of the night discovers the conscience more fully,
   all coverings being then taken away, and since, at that season, the
   affections, either good or bad, according to men's inclinations,
   manifest themselves more freely, when there is no person present to
   witness and pronounce judgment upon them; if thou then examinest me,
   there will be found neither disguise nor deceit in my heart. [347]
   Hence we conclude how great was David's integrity, seeing that, when
   purposely and leisurely taking account of his inmost thoughts, he
   presents himself so boldly, to be tried by the judgment of God. And he
   not only declares himself to be innocent of outward crimes, but also
   free from all secret malice. So far from cherishing malicious designs,
   while he covered them over with fair pretences, as his enemies alleged,
   he protests that his words were a frank and undisguised representation
   of what was passing in his heart: My thought shall not pass beyond my
   mouth. Our thought is said to pass beyond our mouth when, for the
   purpose of deceiving, the mind thinks differently from what the tongue
   expresses. [348] The word zmh, zimmah, which we have translated simply
   thought, may also be taken in a bad sense for deceitful and malicious
   devices.

   4. As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips. Interpreters
   explain this verse in different senses. Some thinking that the letter
   v, beth, which commonly signifies in or by, is taken for against,
   render it thus: As for the works of men which they practice against thy
   word. But I rather incline to the opinion of others who consider that
   there is here commended a right judgment of the actions of men which is
   formed according to the rule of the word of God. There are some shrewd
   and ingenious persons who carefully mark the works of men, but they do
   not judge of them according to the word of God. What we have as yet
   said does not, however, fully give us the sense of the passage. We must
   still consider what the Psalmist means when he speaks of the paths of
   the destroyer. [349] Some think he refers to the men of his own
   company, who, if he had not restrained them, would have instantly
   rushed like robbers to commit depredation; since being reduced to the
   greatest distress, and seeing no prospect of an alteration to the
   better in their affairs, they were become bold through despair; and we
   know how sharp a spur necessity is in goading men forward in any
   course. But this exposition seems to me to be forced, and therefore I
   rather refer the words to his enemies. Farther, there is a diversity of
   opinion among interpreters with respect to the meaning of the word
   watched or observed. Some understand it in this sense, that David had
   done his duty in strenuously opposing outrageous men, and those who
   were wickedly engaged in the work of disturbing the repose and
   tranquillity of their fellow-men. [350] Others understand it thus, that
   he was careful to distinguish between good and evil, or right and
   wrong, that he might not be corrupted by bad examples, [351] but avoid
   them, and, on the contrary, practice those things which he saw to be
   agreeable to the word of God. But David, I have no doubt, had a
   different meaning, and intended to declare, that although wicked and
   malicious men provoked him to evil, he had, nevertheless, been always
   restrained by the word of God, so that he kept himself from exercising
   violence and inflicting injuries, or from rendering evil for evil.
   [352] He therefore tells us, that whatever may have been the works of
   men, he had been always so devoted to the word of God, and so hung, as
   it were, upon his mouth, that he could not think of allowing himself,
   when provoked by the injuries his enemies inflicted on him, to act
   towards them as they acted towards him. We know how severe a temptation
   it is, and how difficult to overcome, to disregard the manner in which
   men behave themselves towards us, and to consider only what God forbids
   or commands us. Even those who are naturally inclined to gentleness and
   humanity, [353] who desire to do good to all men, and wish to hurt
   nobody, whenever they are provoked, burst forth into a revengeful mood,
   carried away by a blind impetuosity; especially when we see all right
   and equity overthrown, the confusion so blinds us, that we begin to
   howl with the wolves. If, therefore, we would have a good rule for
   governing ourselves, when our enemies, by their mischievous actions,
   provoke us to treat them in a similar manner, let us learn, after the
   example of David, to meditate upon the word of God, and to keep our
   eyes fixed upon it. By this means our minds will be preserved from ever
   being blinded, and we shall always avoid the paths of wickedness,
   seeing God will not only keep our affections under restraint by his
   commandments, but will also train them to patience by his promises. He
   withholds us from doing evil to our neighbors, [354] not only by
   forbidding us, but by declaring, at the same time, that he will take
   into his own hand the execution of vengeance on those who injure us,
   [355] he admonishes us to "give place unto wrath," (Romans 12:19.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [344] Great difference of opinion has prevailed among critics, as to
   the rendering and interpretation of this and the following verse. The
   third verse is rendered thus in Tyndale's Bible: "Thou hast proved and
   visited mine heart in the night seasons, thou hast tried me in the
   fire, and hast found no wickedness in me; for I utterly purposed that
   my mouth should not offend." Geddes reads the third clause of the verse
   "Thou hast smelted me, and found in me no dross;" and observes, that
   smelted is "a metaphor taken from the smelting of metals to purify them
   from extraneous matter." -- Geddes' New Translation of the Book of
   Psalms, with Notes. The last clause of the third verse is added to the
   first clause of the fourth verse, in the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac,

   Psalm 17:5-6

   5. Uphold my steps in thy paths, that the soles of my feet may not
   slide. 6. I have called upon thee, surely thou wilt hear me, O God;
   incline thine ear unto me, and hear my words.


   5. Uphold my steps. If we take God's paths for the precepts of his law,
   the sense will be evident, namely, that although David had spoken
   according to truth, in boasting of having, in the midst of the most
   grievous temptations which assailed him, constantly practiced
   righteousness with a pure heart, yet, conscious of his own weakness, he
   commits himself to God to be governed by him, and prays for grace to
   enable him to persevere. His language is as if he had said, Since
   hitherto, under thy guidance, I have proceeded onward in the right
   path, I beseech thee, in like manner, to keep my steps from sliding
   with respect to the time to come. And certainly the more any one excels
   in grace, [356] the more ought he to be afraid of falling; for it is
   the usual policy of Satan to endeavor, even from the virtue and
   strength which God has given us, [357] to produce in us carnal
   confidence which may induce carelessness. I do not altogether reject
   this sense, but I think it more probable that David here beseeches God
   to bring his affairs to a prosperous issue, however dark the aspect of
   matters was at present. The import of his language is this, Lord, since
   thou seest that I walk in uprightness and sincerity of heart, govern
   thou me in such a manner as to make all men see that thou art my
   protector and guardian, and leave me not to be cast down at the will of
   my enemies. Thus, by the paths of the Lord, he will mean not the
   doctrine by which our life is regulated, but the power by which God
   upholds us, and the protection by which he preserves us. And he
   addresses God in this manner, not only because all events are in his
   hand, but because when he takes care of us all things in our lot go on
   prosperously. When he adds, that the soles of my feet may not slide, he
   refers to the many adverse events which threaten us every moment, and
   to the danger we are in of perishing, if not sustained by the hand of
   God.

   6. I have called upon thee, etc. This verb being put in the past tense
   denotes a continued act; and, therefore, it includes the present time.
   The Hebrew word ky, ki, which we translate surely, often signifies
   because, and if it is so understood in this passage, the meaning will
   be, that David took encouragement to pray, because, depending upon the
   promise of God, he hoped that his prayers would not be in vain. But,
   perhaps, it may be thought preferable to change the tense of the verb
   as some do, so as to give this meaning, I will pray, because I have
   hitherto experienced that thou hast heard [358] my prayers. I have,
   however, chosen the exposition what appears to me the more simple.
   David, in my judgment, here encourages and animates himself to call
   upon God, from the confident hope of being heard, as if he had said,
   Since I call upon thee, surely, O God, thou wilt not despise my
   prayers. Immediately after he beseeches God to bestow upon him the
   blessings of which he told us he entertained an assured hope.

   [358] The Septuagint renders the verb in the past tense, "Epekousas

   rendering. The verb, in the Hebrew, is in the future; but it is a
   common thing in Hebrew to use the future tense for the past.

   Psalm 17:7-9

   7. Make marvellous thy mercies, O thou preserver of those who trust [in
   thee, [359] ] from those that exalt themselves against thy right hand.
   8. Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye [360] hide me in the
   shadow of thy wings. 9. From the face of the ungodly, who go about to
   destroy me; and of mine enemies, who besiege [or encompass] my soul.


   7. Make marvellous thy mercies. As the word hphlh, haphleh, signifies
   sometimes to make wonderful, or remarkable, and sometimes to separate
   and set apart, both these senses will be very suitable to this passage.
   In Psalm 31:19, the "goodness" of God is said to be "laid up" in store
   as a peculiar treasure "for them that fear him," that he may bring it
   forth at the proper season, even when they are brought to an extremity,
   and when all things seem to be desperate. If, then, the translation,
   separate and set apart thy mercy, is preferred, the words are a prayer
   that God would display towards his servant David the special grace
   which he communicates to none but his chosen ones. While God involves
   both the good and the bad in danger indiscriminately, he at length
   shows, by the different issue of things, in regard to the two classes,
   that he does not confusedly mingle the chaff and the wheat together,
   seeing he gathers his own people into a company by themselves, (Matthew
   3:12, and Matthew 25:32.) I, however, prefer following another
   exposition. David, in my judgment, perceiving that he could only be
   delivered from the perilous circumstances in which he was placed by
   singular and extraordinary means, betakes himself to the wonderful or
   miraculous power of God. Those who think he desires God to withhold his
   grace from his persecutors do too great violence to the scope of the
   passage. By this circumstance there is expressed the extreme danger to
   which David was exposed; for otherwise it would have been enough for
   him to have been succoured in the ordinary and common way in which God
   is accustomed daily to favor and to aid his own people. The
   grievousness of his distress, therefore, constrained him to beseech God
   to work miraculously for his deliverance. The title with which he here
   honors God, O thou preserver of those who trust [in thee,] serves to
   confirm him in the certain hope of obtaining his requests. As God takes
   upon him the charge of saving all who confide in him, David being one
   of their number, could upon good ground assure himself of safety and
   deliverance. Whenever, therefore, we approach God, let the first
   thought impressed on our minds be, that as he is not in vain called the
   preserver of those who trust in him, we have no reason whatever to be
   afraid of his not being ready to succor us, provided our faith continue
   firmly to rely upon his grace. And if every way of deliverance is shut
   up, let us also at the same time remember that he is possessed of
   wonderful and inconceivable means of succouring us, which serve so much
   the more conspicuously to magnify and manifest his power. But as the
   participle trusting, or hoping, is put without any additional word
   expressing the object of this trust or hope, [361] some interpreters
   connect it with the last words of the verse, thy right hand, as if the
   order of the words were inverted. They, therefore, resolve them thus, O
   thou preserver of those who trust in thy right hand, from those who
   rise up against them. As this, however, is harsh and strained, and the
   exposition which I have given is more natural, and more generally
   received, [362] let us follow it. To express, therefore, the meaning in
   one sentence, the Psalmist attributes to God the office of defending
   and preserving his own people from all the ungodly who rise up to
   assault them, and who, if it were in their power, would destroy them.
   And the ungodly are here said to exalt themselves against the hand of
   God, because, in molesting the faithful whom God has taken under his
   protection, they openly wage war against him. The doctrine contained in
   these words, namely, that when we are molested, an outrage is committed
   upon God in our person, is a very profitable one; for having once
   declared himself to be the guardian and protector of our welfare,
   whenever we are unjustly assailed, he puts forth his hand before us as
   a shield of defense.

   The two similitudes which David has subjoined in the following verse,
   respecting the apple of the eye, and the little birds which the mother
   keeps under her wings, [363] are introduced for illustrating the same
   subject. God, to express the great care which he has of his own people,
   compares himself to a hen and other fowls, which spread out their wings
   to cherish and cover their young, and declares them to be no less dear
   to him than the apple of the eye, which is the tenderest part of the
   body, is to man; it follows, therefore, that whenever men rise up to
   molest and injure the righteous, war is waged against him. As this form
   of prayer was put into the mouth of David by the Holy Spirit, it is to
   be regarded as containing in it a promise. We have here presented to
   our contemplation a singular and an astonishing proof of the goodness
   of God, in humbling himself so far, and in a manner so to speak,
   transforming himself, in order to lift up our faith above the
   conceptions of the flesh.

   9. From the face of the ungodly. The Psalmist, by again accusing his
   enemies, intends to set forth his own innocence, as an argument for his
   obtaining the favor of God. At the same time, he complains of their
   cruelty, that God may be the more inclined to aid him. First, he says
   that they burn with an enraged desire to waste and to destroy him;
   secondly, he adds, that they besiege him in his soul, by which he
   means, that they would never rest satisfied until they had accomplished
   his death. The greater, therefore, the terror with which we are
   stricken by the cruelty of our enemies, the more ought we to be
   quickened to ardor in prayer. God, indeed, does not need to receive
   information and incitement from us; but the use and the end of prayer
   is, that the faithful, by freely declaring to God the calamities and
   sorrows which oppress them, and in disburdening them, as it were, into
   his bosom, may be assured beyond all doubt that he has a regard to
   their necessities.

   Psalm 17:10-12

   10. They have inclosed themselves in their own fat, [364] they have
   spoken proudly with their mouth. 11. They have now compassed me round
   about in our steps; they have fixed their eyes to cast down to the
   ground. 12. The likeness of him is as a lion that desireth to tear in
   pieces, and as a lion's whelp which lurketh in secret places.


   10. They have inclosed themselves in their own fat If the translation
   which is given by others is considered preferable, They have inclosed
   their own fat, the meaning will be quite the same. Some Jewish
   interpreters explain the words thus: that being stuffed with fat, and
   their throat being, as it were, choked with it, they were unable to
   speak freely; but this is a very meagre and unsatisfactory exposition.
   By the word fat, I think, is denoted the pride with which they were
   filled and swollen, as it were, with fatness. It is a very appropriate
   and expressive metaphor to represent them as having their hearts choked
   up with pride, in the manner in which corpulent persons are affected
   from the fat within them. [365] David complains of their being puffed
   up with their wealth and pleasures, and accordingly we see the ungodly,
   the more luxuriously they are pampered, conducting themselves the more
   outrageously and proudly. But I think there is described by the word
   fat an inward vice namely, their being inclosed on all sides with
   arrogance and presumption, and their having become utter strangers to
   every feeling of humanity. [366] The Psalmist next declares that this
   is abundantly manifested in their language. In short, his meaning is,
   that inwardly they swell with pride, and that they take no pains to
   conceal it, as appears from the high swelling words to which they give
   utterance. When it is said, They have spoken proudly with their mouth,
   the word mouth is not a pleonasm, as it often is in other places; for
   David means, that with mouths widely opened they pour forth scornful
   and contemptuous language, which bears testimony to the pride which
   dwells within them.

   11. They have now compassed me round about in our steps. The Psalmist
   confirms what he has said before concerning the furious passion for
   doing mischief with which his enemies were inflamed. He says they were
   so cruelly bent on accomplishing his destruction, that in whatever way
   he directed or altered his course, they ceased not to follow close upon
   him. When he says our steps, he doubtless comprehends his own
   companions, although he immediately after returns to speak of himself
   alone; unless, perhaps, another reading is preferred, for some copies
   have svvvnv, sebabunu, They have compassed us, in the plural number.
   This, however, is not a matter of great importance. David simply
   complains, that unless God stretch forth his hand from heaven to
   deliver him, there now remains for him no way of escape, seeing his
   enemies, whenever he stirs his foot to avoid their fury, immediately
   pursue him, and watch all his steps. By the adverb now, he intimates
   not only that he is at present in very great danger, but also that at
   every moment his enemies, in whatever way he turns himself, pursue and
   press hard upon him. In the last clause, They have fixed their eyes to
   cast down to the ground, some consider David as comparing his enemies
   to hunters, who, with eyes fixed on the ground, are silently looking
   with eager desire for their prey. They, therefore, think that by the
   eyes fixed on the ground is denoted the gesture or attitude of David's
   adversaries, and certainly crafty and malicious men have their
   countenance often fixed on the ground. According to others, whose
   opinion is nearer the spirit of the passage, this form of expression
   signifies the continual and unwearied ardor by which the ungodly are
   impelled to turn all things upside down. To fix their eyes, therefore,
   is nothing else than to apply all their ingenuity, and put forth all
   their efforts. What follows, to cast down to the ground, is the same
   thing as to overthrow. The ungodly, as if they must necessarily fall,
   should the world continue to stand, would wish all mankind thrown down
   or destroyed, and, therefore, they exert themselves to the utmost to
   bring down and ruin all men. This is explained more fully by the
   figurative illustration introduced in the following verse, where they
   are said to be like lions and lions' whelps [367] But we ought always
   to keep this truth in remembrance, that the more proudly wicked men
   exercise their cruelty against us, the hand of God is so much the
   nearer to us to oppose itself to their savage fury; for to him alone
   belongs the praise of subduing and restraining these wild beasts who
   delight in shedding blood. David speaks of dens, or secret lurking
   places, because his enemies were deeply skilled in artful stratagem,
   and had various methods of doing mischief, while they had also at hand
   the power and means of executing them, so that it was difficult to
   resist them.

   [364] Houbigant and Kennicott read, ly chvlmv sgrv "They have closed

   Rogers, "it receives no support from the ancient versions or MSS."

   [365] "Comme les gens replets se trouvent saisis de leur graisse au

   119:70; Job 15:27." - French and Skinner's Translation of the Book of
   Psalms. There may no doubt be a reference to the personal appearance
   and sensual indulgence of David's enemies. But something more is
   implied. "We know that, in the figurative language of Scripture fatness
   denotes pride. This connection of ideas is still maintained in the
   East, where, when it is intended to indicate a proud man, he is said to
   be fat, or to look fat, whether really so or not." -- Illustrated
   Commentary upon the Bible.

   [366] Dr Geddes translates the clause, "Their hearts have they
   hardened." "Literally," says he, "they have closed their midriff; --
   shut out all compassion from their hearts." The Hebrew word which is
   rendered fat is explained by Gesenius, when used figuratively, as
   denoting a fat, that is, an unfeeling heart.

   [367] In the French version it is lionceaux, young lions. French and
   Skinner read "like a lion," and "like a young lion;' and observe, "The
   word translated young lion' signifies a lion in the rigour of youth,
   and fully capable of pursuing his prey."

   Psalm 17:13-14

   13. Arise, O Jehovah, prevent [or go before] his face, lay him
   prostrate on the ground; [368] deliver my soul from the ungodly man by
   thy sword: 14. From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, from men who are of
   long duration, [or who are from an age, [369] ] whose portion is in
   life, whose belly thou fillest with thy secret goods; their children
   are filled with them, and they leave the rest to their babes.


   13. Arise, O Jehovah. The more furiously David was persecuted by his
   enemies, he beseeches God the more earnestly to afford him immediate
   aid; for he uses the word face to denote the swift impetuosity of his
   adversary, to repress which there was need of the greatest haste. By
   these words, the Holy Spirit teaches us, that when death shows itself
   to be just at hand, God is provided with remedies perfectly prepared,
   by which he can effect our deliverance in a moment. The Psalmist not
   only attributes to God the office of delivering his people; he at the
   same time arms him with power to crush and break in pieces the wicked.
   He does not, however, wish them to be cast down farther than was
   necessary to their being humbled, that they might cease from their
   outrageous and injurious conduct towards him, as we may gather from the
   following clause, where he again beseeches God to deliver his soul
   David would have been contented to see them continuing in the
   possession of their outward ease and prosperity, had they not abused
   their power by practising injustice and cruelty. Let us know then, that
   God consults the good of his people when he overthrows the ungodly, and
   breaks their strength; when he does this, it is for the purpose of
   delivering from destruction the poor innocents who are molested by
   these wretched men. [370] Some expositors read the passage thus, From
   the ungodly man, who is thy sword, [371] and also, From the men who are
   thy hand; but this does not seem to me to be a proper translation. I
   admit, that from whatever quarter afflictions come to us, it is the
   hand of God which chastises us, and that the ungodly are the scourges
   he employs for this purpose; and farther, that this consideration is
   very well fitted to lead us to exercise patience. But as this manner of
   speaking would here be somewhat harsh, and, at the same time, not very
   consistent with the prayer, I prefer adopting the exposition which
   represents David's words as a prayer that God would deliver him by his
   sword, and smite with his hand those men who, for too long a time, had
   been in possession of power and prosperity. He contrasts God's sword
   with human aids and human means of relief; and the import of his words
   is, If God himself does not come forth to take vengeance, and draw his
   sword, there remains for me no hope of deliverance.

   14. From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, from men who are from an age. I
   connect these words thus: O Lord, deliver me by thy hand, or by thy
   heavenly aid, from men; I say from men whose tyranny has prevailed too
   long, and whom thou hast suffered to wallow too long in the filth and
   draft of their prosperity. This repetition is very emphatic; David's
   voice being stifled, as it were, with the indignation which he felt at
   seeing such villany continuing for so long a period, he stops all at
   once after uttering the first word, without proceeding farther in the
   sentence which he meant to express; then, after having recovered his
   breath, he declares what it is that so greatly distressed him. In the
   preceding verse he had spoken in the singular number; but now he gives
   us to understand that he had not only one enemy but many, and that
   those who were set against him were strong and powerful, so that he saw
   no hope of deliverance remaining for him except in the aid of God.

   These words, from world, or age, (for such is the exact literal
   rendering, [372] ) are expounded in different ways. Some understand
   them as meaning men who have their time, as if David intended to say
   that their prosperous condition would not be of long duration; but this
   does not appear to me to be the proper explanation. Others suppose he
   means by this expression such as are wholly devoted to the world, and
   whose whole attention and thoughts are absorbed in the things of earth;
   and, according to their opinion, David compares his enemies to brute
   beasts. In the same sense they explain what follows immediately after,
   Their portion is in life, language which they consider as applied to
   them, because, being entirely destitute of the Spirit, and cleaving
   with their whole hearts to transitory good things, they think of
   nothing better than this world. For that in which each man places his
   felicity is termed his portion. As, however, the Hebrew word chld,
   cheled, signifies an age, or the course of a man's life, David, I doubt
   not, complains that his enemies had lived and enjoyed prosperity longer
   than the ordinary term allotted to the life of man. The audacity and
   the outrages [373] committed by wicked men might be borne with for a
   short time, but when they wax wanton against God, it is very strange
   indeed to see them continuing stable in their prosperous condition.
   That this is the sense appears from the preposition mn, min, which we
   have translated from, by which David expresses that they were not
   sprung up only a few days before or lately, but that their prosperity,
   which should have vanished away in a moment, had lasted for a very long
   time. Such, then, is the meaning of the Psalmist, unless, perhaps, we
   may understand him as denominating them of the world, or age, because
   they bear the chief authority among men, and are exalted in honors and
   riches, as if this world had been made for them alone.

   When he says, Their portion is in life, I explain it as meaning that
   they are exempted from all troubles, and abound in pleasures; in short,
   that they do not experience the common condition of other men; as, on
   the contrary, when a man is oppressed with adversities, it is said of
   him that his portion is in death. David therefore intimates, that it is
   not a reasonable thing that the ungodly should be permitted to gad
   about in joy and gaiety without having any fear of death, and to claim
   for themselves, as if by hereditary right, a peaceful and happy life.

   What he adds immediately after, Whose belly thou fillest with thy
   secret goods, is of the same import. We see these persons not only
   enjoying, in common with other men, light, breath, food, and all other
   commodities of life, but we also see God often treating them more
   delicately and more bountifully than others, as if he fed them on his
   lap, holding them tenderly like little babes, and fondling them more
   than all the rest of mankind. [374] Accordingly, by the secret goods of
   God, we are here to understand the rare and more exquisite dainties
   which he bestows upon them. Now, this is a severe temptation, if a man
   estimates the love and favor of God by the measure of earthly
   prosperity which he bestows; and, therefore, it is not to be wondered
   at, though David was greatly afflicted in contemplating the prosperous
   condition of ungodly men. But let us remember that he makes this holy
   complaint to console himself, and to mitigate his distress, not in the
   way of murmuring against God and resisting his will; - let us remember
   this, I say, that, after his example, we may learn also to direct our
   groanings to heaven. Some give a more subtile exposition of what is
   here called God's secret goods, viewing it as meaning the good things
   which the ungodly devour without thinking of or regarding him who is
   the author of them; or they suppose the good things of God to be called
   secret, because the reason why God pours them forth so abundantly upon
   the wicked is not apparent. But the exposition which I have given, as
   it is both simple and natural, so of itself it sufficiently disproves
   the others. The last point in this description is, that, by continual
   succession, these persons transmit their riches to their children and
   their children's children. As they are not among the number of the
   children of God, to whom this blessing is promised, it follows, that
   when they are thus fattened, it is for the day of slaughter which he
   hath appointed. The object which David therefore has in view in making
   this complaint is, that God would make haste to execute vengeance,
   seeing they have so long abused his liberality and gentle treatment.

   Psalm 17:15

   15. But as for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
   satisfied, when I shall awake, with thy image, [or likeness.]


   Having with anguish of heart declared before God the troubles which
   afflicted and tormented him, that he might not be overwhelmed with the
   load of temptations which pressed upon him, he now takes, as it were,
   the wings of faith and rises up to a region of undisturbed
   tranquillity, where he may behold all things arranged and directed in
   due order. In the first place, there is here a tacit comparison between
   the well regulated state of things which will be seen when God by his
   judgment shall restore to order those things which are now embroiled
   and confused, and the deep and distressing darkness which is in the
   world, when God keeps silence, and hides his face. In the midst of
   those afflictions which he has recounted, the Psalmist might seem to be
   plunged in darkness from which he would never obtain deliverance. [375]
   When we see the ungodly enjoying prosperity, crowned with honors, and
   loaded with riches, they seem to be in great favor with God. But David
   triumphs over their proud and presumptuous boasting; and although, to
   the eye of sense and reason, God has cast him off, and removed him far
   from him, yet he assures himself that one day he will enjoy the
   privilege of familiarly beholding him. The pronoun I is emphatic, as if
   he had said, The calamities and reproaches which I now endure will not
   prevent me from again experiencing fullness of joy from the fatherly
   love of God manifested towards me. We ought carefully to observe, that
   David, in order to enjoy supreme happiness, desires nothing more than
   to have always the taste and experience of this great blessing that God
   is reconciled to him. The wicked may imagine themselves to be happy,
   but so long as God is opposed to them, they deceive themselves in
   indulging this imagination. To behold God's face, is nothing else than
   to have a sense of his fatherly favor, with which he not only causes us
   to rejoice by removing our sorrows, but also transports us even to
   heaven. By the word righteousness, David means that he will not be
   disappointed of the reward of a good conscience. As long as God humbles
   his people under manifold afflictions, the world insolently mocks at
   their simplicity, as if they deceived themselves, and lost their pains
   in devoting themselves to the cultivation and practice of purity and
   innocence. [376] Against such kind of mockery and derision David is
   here struggling, and in opposition to it he assures himself that there
   is a recompense laid up for his godliness and uprightness, provided he
   continue to persevere in his obedience to the holy law of God; as
   Isaiah, in like manner, (Isaiah 3:10,) exhorts the faithful to support
   themselves from this consideration, that "it shall be well with the
   righteous: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings." We ought not,
   however, from this to think that he represents works as the cause of
   his salvation. It is not his purpose to treat of what constitutes the
   meritorious ground upon which he is to be received into the favor of
   God. He only lays it down as a principle, that they who serve God do
   not lose their labor, for although he may hide his face from them for a
   time, he causes them again in due season to behold his bright
   countenance [377] and compassionate eye beaming upon them.

   I shall be satisfied. Some interpreters, with more subtility than
   propriety, restrict this to the resurrection at the last day, as if
   David did not expect to experience in his heart a blessed joy [378]
   until the life to come, and suspended every longing desire after it
   until he should attain to that life. I readily admit that this
   satisfaction of which he speaks will not in all respects be perfect
   before the last coming of Christ; but as the saints, when God causes
   some rays of the knowledge of his love to enter into their hearts, find
   great enjoyment in the light thus communicated, David justly calls this
   peace or joy of the Holy Spirit satisfaction. The ungodly may be at
   their ease, and have abundance of good things, even to bursting, but as
   their desire is insatiable, or as they feed upon wind, in other words,
   upon earthly things, without tasting spiritual things, in which there
   is substance, [379] or being so stupified through the pungent remorse
   of conscience with which they are tormented, as not to enjoy the good
   things which they possess, they never have composed and tranquil minds,
   but are kept unhappy by the inward passions with which they are
   perplexed and agitated. It is therefore the grace of God alone which
   can give us contentment, [380] and prevent us from being distracted by
   irregular desires. David, then, I have no doubt, has here an allusion
   to the empty joys of the world, which only famish the soul, while they
   sharpen and increase the appetite the more, [381] in order to show that
   those only are partakers of true and substantial happiness who seek
   their felicity in the enjoyment of God alone. As the literal rendering
   of the Hebrew words is, I shall be satisfied in the awaking of thy
   face, or, in awaking by thy face; some, preferring the first
   exposition, understand by the awaking of God's face the breaking forth,
   or manifestation of the light of his grace, which before was, as it
   were, covered with clouds. But to me it seems more suitable to refer
   the word awake to David, [382] and to view it as meaning the same thing
   as to obtain respite from his sorrow. David had never indeed been
   overwhelmed with stupor; but after a lengthened period of fatigue,
   through the persecution of his enemies, he must needs have been brought
   into such a state as to appear sunk into a profound sleep. The saints
   do not sustain and repel all the assaults which are made upon them so
   courageously as not, by reason of the weakness of their flesh, to feel
   languid and feeble for a time, or to be terrified, as if they were
   enveloped in darkness. David compares this perturbation of mind to a
   sleep. But when the favor of God shall again have arisen and shone
   brightly upon him, he declares that then he will recover spiritual
   strength and enjoy tranquillity of mind. It is true, indeed, as Paul
   declares, that so long as we continue in this state of earthly
   pilgrimage, "we walk by faith, not by sight;" but as we nevertheless
   behold the image of God not only in the glass of the gospel, but also
   in the numerous evidences of his grace which he daily exhibits to us,
   let each of us awaken himself from his lethargy, that we may now be
   satisfied with spiritual felicity, until God, in due time, bring us to
   his own immediate presence, and cause us to enjoy him face to face.

   [336] This is the general opinion as to the occasion of the composition
   of this psalm. It is supposed that David, in representing his innocence
   of those things of which he was accused, refers to the charges brought
   against him of traitorously aspiring to the kingdom, and seeking the
   life of Saul, 1 Samuel 24:9; and that therefore the persecutors and
   calumniators from whom he beseeches God to deliver him were Saul and
   his courtiers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 18.

   We all know through what difficulties and almost insurmountable
   obstacles David came to the kingdom. Even to the time of Saul's death
   he was a fugitive, and, as it were, an outlaw, and wearily passed his
   life in fear, amidst many threatenings and dangers of death. After God
   had, with his own hand, placed him on the royal throne, he was
   immediately harassed with the tumults and insurrections of his own
   subjects, and the hostile faction being superior to him in power, he
   was often at the point of being completely overthrown. Foreign enemies,
   on the other hand, severely tried him even to his old age. These
   calamities he would never have surmounted had he not been aided by the
   power of God. Having therefore obtained many and signal victories, he
   does not, as irreligious men are accustomed to do, sing a song of
   triumph in honor of himself, but exalts and magnifies God the author of
   these victories, by a train of striking and appropriate epithets, and
   in a style of surpassing grandeur and sublimity. This psalm, therefore,
   is the first of those psalms in which David celebrates, in lofty
   strains, the wonderful grace which God had shown towards him, both in
   putting him in possession of the kingdom, and in afterwards maintaining
   him in it. He also shows that his reign was an image and type of the
   kingdom of Christ, to teach and assure the faithful that Christ, in
   spite of the whole world, and of all the resistance which it can make,
   will, by the stupendous and incomprehensible power of the Father, be
   always victorious.

   To the chief musician of David, the servant of Jehovah, who sung to
   Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him
   from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.

   We ought carefully to mark the particular time when this psalm was
   composed, as it shows us that David, when his affairs were brought to a
   state of peace and prosperity, was not intoxicated with extravagant joy
   like irreligious men, who, when they have obtained deliverance from
   their calamities, shake off from their minds the remembrance of God's
   benefits, and plunge themselves into gross and degrading pleasures, or
   erect their crests, and obscure the glory of God by their proud and
   vain boasting. David, as the sacred history relates, (2 Samuel 22:1,)
   sung this song to the Lord, when he was now almost spent with age, and
   when, being delivered from all his troubles, he enjoyed tranquillity.
   The inscription here agrees with that account, and, from What is there
   stated, we conclude, that it has not been improperly or incorrectly
   prefixed to this psalm. David points out the time when it was sung,
   namely, after God had delivered him from all his enemies, to show us
   that he was then in perfectly quiet possession of his kingdom, and that
   God had assisted him not once, nor against one kind of enemies only;
   seeing his conflicts were from time to time renewed, and the end of one
   war was the commencement of another; yea, many armies often rose up
   against him at the same time. Since the creation of the world, we will
   scarcely find another individual in it whom God has tried by so many
   and so varied afflictions. As Saul had persecuted him with more
   cruelty, and with greater fury and determination than all others, his
   name on that account is here expressly mentioned, although, in the
   preceding clause, the Psalmist had spoken in general terms of all his
   enemies. Saul is not put last, as if he had been one of his later
   enemies, [383] for his death had taken place about thirty years
   previous to this time; and since that event David had discomfited many
   foreign enemies, and had also suppressed the rebellion of his own son
   Absalom. But, persuaded that it was a singular manifestation of the
   grace of God towards him, and eminently worthy of being remembered,
   that he had for so many years escaped from innumerable deaths, or
   rather that as many days as he had lived under the reign of Saul, God
   had wrought, as it were, so many miracles for his deliverance, he
   firstly mentions and celebrates in particular his deliverance from the
   hands of this relentless enemy. By calling himself the servant of God,
   he doubtless intended to bear testimony to his call to be king, as if
   he had said, I have not rashly, and by my own authority, usurped the
   kingdom, but have only acted in obedience to the oracle of heaven. And,
   indeed, amidst the many storms which he had to encounter, it was a
   support highly necessary to be well assured in his own mind of having
   undertaken nothing but by the appointment of God; or rather, this was
   to him a peaceful haven, and a secure retreat in the midst of so many
   broils and strange calamities. [384] There is not a more wretched
   object than mail in adversity, when he has brought himself into
   distress by acting according to the mere impulse of his own mind, and
   not by acting in obedience to the call of God. David, therefore, had a
   good reason for wishing it to be known that it was not ambition which
   impelled him to enter into those contests which were so painful and
   difficult for him to bear, and that he had not attempted any thing
   unlawful or by wicked means, but had always kept steadily in view the
   will of God, which served as a light to guide him in his path. This is
   a point which it is highly useful for us to know, in order that we may
   not expect to be exempted from all trouble, when we follow the call of
   God, but may rather prepare ourselves for a condition of warfare
   painful and disagreeable to our flesh. The name servant, therefore, in
   this passage, as in many others, relates to his public office; just as
   when the prophets and apostles call themselves the servants of God,
   they have a reference to their official character. It is as if he had
   said, I am not a king of my own creation, but have been chosen by God
   to fill that high station. At the same time, we ought particularly to
   notice the humility of David, who, although distinguished by so many
   victories, and the conqueror of so many nations, and possessed of so
   great dignity and wealth, honors himself with no other title than this,
   The servant of God; as if he meant to show that he accounted it more
   honorable to have faithfully performed the duties of the office with
   which God had invested him, than to possess all the honors and
   excellence of the world.

   Psalm 18:1-2

   1. And he said, I will affectionately love thee, [385] O Jehovah, my
   strength. 2. Jehovah is my rock, [386] a my fortress, and my deliverer;
   my God, my rock, I will trust in him my shield, and the horn [387] of
   my salvation, my refuge.


   1. And he said, etc. I will not stop to examine too minutely the
   syllables, or the few words, in which this psalm differs from the song
   which is recorded in the twenty-second chapter of the Second Book of
   Samuel. When, however, we meet with any important difference, we shall
   advert to it in the proper place; and we find one in the remarkable
   sentence with which this psalm commences, I will love thee
   affectionately, O Jehovah, my strength, which is omitted in the song in
   Samuel. As the Scripture does not use the verb rhm, racham, for to
   love, except in the conjugation pihel, and as it is here put in the
   conjugation kal, some of the Jewish expositors explain it as here
   meaning to seek mercy; as if David had said, Lord, since I have so
   often experienced thee to be a merciful God, I will trust to and repose
   in thy mercies for ever. And certainly this exposition would not be
   unsuitable, but I am unwilling to depart from the other, which is more
   generally received. It is to be observed, that love to God is here laid
   down as constituting the principal part of true godliness; for there is
   no better way of serving God than to love him. No doubt, the service
   which we owe him is better expressed by the word reverence, that thus
   his majesty may prominently stand forth to our view in its infinite
   greatness. But as he requires nothing so expressly as to possess all
   the affections of our heart, and to have them going out towards him, so
   there is no sacrifice which he values more than when we are bound fast
   to him by the chain of a free and spontaneous love; and, on the other
   hand, there is nothing in which his glory shines forth more
   conspicuously than in his free and sovereign goodness. Moses,
   therefore, (Deuteronomy 10:12,) when he meant to give a summary of the
   law, says,

   "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require
   of thee but to love him?"

   In speaking thus, David, at the same time, intended to show that his
   thoughts and affections were not so intently fixed upon the benefits of
   God as to be ungrateful to him who was the author of them, a sin which
   has been too common in all ages. Even at this day we see how the
   greater part of mankind enjoy wholly at their ease the gifts of God
   without paying any regard to him, or, if they think of him at all, it
   is only to despise him. David, to prevent himself from falling into
   this ingratitude, in these words makes as it were a solemn vow, Lord,
   as thou art my strength, I will continue united and devoted to thee by
   unfeigned love.

   2. Jehovah is my rock, etc. When David thus heaps together many titles
   by which to honor God, it is no useless or unnecessary accumulation of
   words. We know how difficult it is for men to keep their minds and
   hearts stayed in God. They either imagine that it is not enough to have
   God for them, and, consequently, are always seeking after support and
   succor elsewhere, or, at the first temptation which assails them, fall
   from the confidence which they placed in him. David, therefore, by
   attributing to God various methods of saving his people, protests that,
   provided he has God for his protector and defender, he is effectually
   fortified against all peril and assault; as if he had said, Those whom
   God intends to succor and defend are not only safe against one kind of
   dangers, but are as it were surrounded by impregnable ramparts on all
   sides, so that, should a thousand deaths be presented to their view,
   they ought not to be afraid even at this formidable array. [388] We
   see, then, that the design of David here is not only to celebrate the
   praises of God, in token of his gratitude, but also to fortify our
   minds with a firm and steadfast faith, so that, whatever afflictions
   befall us, we may always have recourse to God, and may be fully
   persuaded that he has virtue and power to assist us in different ways,
   according to the different methods of doing us mischief which the
   wicked devise. Nor, as I have observed before, does David insist so
   much on this point, and express the same thing by different terms
   without cause. God may have aided us in one way, and yet whenever a new
   tempest arises, we are immediately stricken with terror, as if we had
   never experienced any thing of his aid. And those who in one trouble
   expect protection and succor from him, but who afterwards circumscribe
   his power, accounting it limited in other respects, act like a man who
   upon going into battle, considers himself well secured as to his
   breast, because he has a breastplate and a shield to defend him, and
   yet is afraid of his head, because he is without a helmet. David,
   therefore, here furnishes the faithful with a complete suit of armor,
   [389] that they may feel that they are in no danger of being wounded,
   provided they are shielded by the power of God. That such is the object
   he has in view, is apparent from the declaration which he makes of his
   confidence in God: I will trust in him Let us, therefore, learn from
   his example, to apply to our own use those titles which are here
   attributed to God, and to apply them as an antidote against all the
   perplexities and distresses which may assail us; or rather, let them be
   deeply imprinted upon our memory, so that we may be able at once to
   repel to a distance whatever fear Satan may suggest to our mind. I give
   this exhortation, not only because we tremble under the calamities with
   which we are presently assailed, but also because we groundlessly
   conjure up in our own imaginations dangers as to the time to come, and
   thus needlessly disquiet ourselves by the mere creations of fancy. In
   the song, as recorded in 2 Samuel 22:3, instead of these words, My God,
   my rock, it is, God of my rock. And after the word refuge, there is, My
   fortress, my savior, thou shalt preserve me from violence; words which
   make the sentence fuller, but the meaning comes to the same thing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [385] This is the rendering of the French version. The word in the
   Hebrew text, which is rchm, racham, is very expressive. "rchm," says
   Cocceius, "est intime ac medullitus cum motu omnium viscerum diligere;"
   -- "is to love with the deepest and strongest affections of the heart,
   with all of all the bowels." Ainsworth reads, "I will dearly love
   thee;" Street, "I love thee exceedingly;" Bishop Horne, "With all the
   yearnings of affection I will love thee, O Jehovah;" and Dr Adam
   Clarke, "From my inmost bowels will I love thee, O Lord." The word,
   therefore, denotes the tenderness and intensity of David's emotions.

   [386] The Hebrew word literally means a cliff or crag; and is a
   different word from the one which is translated rock in the following
   part of this verse. "The word sl, sela," says Dr Adam Clarke,
   "signifies those craggy precipices which afforded shelter to men and
   animals; where the bees often made their nests, and whence honey was
   collected in great abundance. He made him to suck honey out of the
   rock,' Deuteronomy 32:13."

   [387] The horn is the emblem of strength and power. The metaphor is
   taken from the bull and other powerful animals, who put forth their
   strength principally by the use of their horns.

   [388] "Comme environnez de bons rempars de tous costez, tellement que
   mille morts, quand autant il s'en presenteroit a eux, ne leur doyvent
   point faire peur." -- Fr.

   [389] "Et pourtant David equippe yci les fideles de pied en cap comme
   on dit." -- Fr. "David, therefore, here equips the faithful from head
   to foot, as we say."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 18:3-6

   3. I will call upon the praised Jehovah, and I shall be saved from mine
   enemies. 4. The cords [390] of death had compassed me about; the
   torrents of wickedness [391] had made me afraid. 5. The cords of the
   grave [392] had compassed me about; the snares of death had prevented
   me. 6. In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried to my God: and
   he heard my voice from his temple, and my cry came before him, even
   into his ears.


   3. I will call upon the praised Jehovah. Calling upon God, as has been
   observed elsewhere, frequently comprehends the whole of his service;
   but as the effect or fruit of prayer is particularly mentioned in what
   follows, this phrase in the passage before us, I have no doubt,
   signifies to have recourse to God for protection, and to ask by prayer
   deliverance from him. David having said in the second verse, that he
   trusted in God, now subjoins this as an evidence of his trust; for
   every one who confides in God will earnestly beseech his aid in the
   time of need. He therefore declares, that he will be saved, and prove
   victorious over all his enemies, because he will have recourse to God
   for help. He calls God the praised Jehovah, not only to intimate that
   he is worthy of being praised, as almost all interpreters explain it,
   but also to point out, that, when he came to the throne of grace, his
   prayers would be mingled and interwoven with praises. [393] The scope
   of the passage seems to require that it be understood as meaning, that
   giving thanks to God for the benefits which he has received from him in
   times past, he will ask his assistance by renewed supplications. And
   certainly no man will ever invoke God in prayer freely and frankly
   unless he animate and encourage himself by the remembrance of the grace
   of God. Accordingly Paul, in Philippians 4:6, exhorts the faithful

   "in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, to make
   their requests known unto God" (Philippians 4:6)

   and to disburden their cares, as it were, into his bosom. All those
   whose prayers are not accompanied with the praises of God are
   chargeable with clamouring and complaining against him, when engaged in
   that solemn exercise.

   4. The cords [394] of death had compassed me about. David now begins to
   recount the undoubted and illustrious proofs by which he had
   experienced that the hand of God is sufficiently strong and powerful to
   repel all the dangers and calamities with which he may be assailed. And
   we need not wonder that those things which might have been described
   more simply, and in an unadorned style, are clothed in poetical forms
   of expression, and set forth with all the elegancies and ornaments of
   language. The Holy Spirit, to contend against and make an impression
   upon the wicked and perverse dispositions of men, has here furnished
   David with eloquence full of majesty, energy, and wonderful power, to
   awaken mankind to consider the benefits of God. There is scarcely any
   assistance God bestows, however evident and palpable it may be to our
   senses, which our indifference or proud disdain does not obscure.
   David, therefore, the more effectually to move and penetrate our minds,
   says that the deliverance and succor which God had granted him had been
   conspicuous in the whole frame-work of the world. This his intention it
   is needful for us to take into view, lest we should think that he
   exceeds due bounds in expressing himself in a style so remarkable for
   sublimity. The sum is, that, when in his distresses he had been reduced
   to extremity, he had betaken himself to God for help, and had been
   wonderfully preserved.

   We shall now make a few observations with respect to the words. The
   Hebrew word chvly, chebley, means cords or sorrows, or any deadly evil,
   [395] which consumes a man's health and strength, and which tends to
   his destruction. That the psalm may correspond with the song recorded
   in 2nd Samuel, formerly referred to, I do not disapprove of this word
   being here taken for contrition, because the phrase there employed is
   msvry mvt, mishberey maveth, [396] and the noun msvry, mishberey, is
   derived from a verb which signifies to break. But as the metaphor taken
   from cords or snares agrees better with the verb compass about, the
   import of which is, that David was on all sides involved and entangled
   in the perils of death, I am disposed rather to adopt this
   interpretation. What follows concerning torrents implies that he had
   been almost overwhelmed by the violence and impetuosity of his enemies
   against him, even as a man who is covered over the head with floods of
   water is almost lost. He calls them the torrents of Belial, because it
   was wicked and perverse men who had conspired against him. The Hebrew
   word Belial has a wide signification. With respect to its etymology
   there are different opinions among expositors. Why Jerome has rendered
   it without yoke, [397] I know not. The more generally received opinion
   is, that it is compounded of these two words, vly, beli, not, and yl,
   yaäl, [398] to denote that the wicked do not rise, in other words,
   ultimately gain nothing, and obtain no advantage by their infatuated
   course. The Jews certainly employed this word to designate every kind
   of detestable wickedness, and from this it is highly probable that
   David by it meant to describe his enemies, who basely and wickedly
   plotted his destruction. [399] If, however, any prefer translating the
   phrase, by deadly torrents, I am not disposed to oppose this rendering.
   In the following verse he again repeats, that the corruptions or cords
   of the grave had compassed him about As the Hebrew word is the same
   which he had employed in the preceding verse, I have thought it proper
   to translate it cords here, as I have done there, not only because he
   uses a verb which signifies to beset, to inclose, or to surround, but
   also because he adds immediately after, the snares of death, which, in
   my opinion, is to be understood in the same sense. This, then, is the
   description of the dangerous circumstances into which he was brought,
   and it enhances and magnifies so much the more the glory of his
   deliverance. As David had been reduced to a condition so desperate that
   no hope of relief or deliverance from it was apparent, it is certain
   that he was delivered by the hand of God, and that it was not a thing
   effected by the power of man.

   6. In my distress, etc. It was a very evident proof of uncommon faith
   in David, when, being almost plunged into the gulf of death, he lifted
   up his heart to heaven by prayer. Let us therefore learn, that such an
   example is set before our eyes, that no calamities, however great and
   oppressive, may hinder us from praying, or create an aversion to it. It
   was prayer which brought to David the fruits or wonderful effects of
   which he speaks a little after, and from this it appears still more
   clearly that his deliverance was effected by the power of God. In
   saying that he cried, he means, as we have observed elsewhere, the
   ardor and earnestness of affection which he had in prayer. Again, by
   calling God his God, he separates himself from the gross despisers of
   God, or hypocrites, who, when constrained by necessity, call upon the
   Divine Majesty in a confused and tumultuous manner, but do not come to
   God familiarly and with a pure heart, as they know nothing of his
   fatherly favor and goodness. When, therefore, as we approach to God,
   faith goes before to illumine the way, giving us the full persuasion
   that He is our Father, then is the gate opened, and we may converse
   freely with Him and he with us. David, by calling God his God, and
   putting him on his side, also intimates that God was opposed to his
   enemies; and this serves to show that he was actuated by true piety and
   the fear of God. By the word temple we are not here to understand the
   sanctuary as in many other places, but heaven; for the description
   which immediately follows cannot be applied to the sanctuary.
   Accordingly, the sense is, that when David was forsaken and abandoned
   in the world, and all men shut their ears to his cry for help, God
   stretched forth his hand from heaven to save him.

   [393] The word in the Hebrew text mhll, mehullal, literally signifies
   praise. The ancient versions view the word not as denoting that God is
   worthy to be praised, which is the meaning attached to it in our
   English version, but as referring to the Psalmist's resolution to
   praise God. The Septuagint reads, Ainon epikalesomai Kurion Kytov,
   "Praising I will call upon the Lord." The reading of the Vulgate is the
   same, "Laudans invocabo." The Chaldee reads, "In a song or hymn I pour
   out prayers unto the Lord:" and the Arabic. "I will praise the Lord,
   and call upon him." This is precisely the sense in which Calvin
   understands the words, "I will call upon the praised Jehovah."

   [394] "Death is here personified under the semblance of a mighty
   conqueror, who binds his vanquished foes in strong fetters." --
   Walford.

   [395] "chvl, chebel," says Hammond, "signifies two things, a cord, and
   a pang of a woman's travail, and which it signifies must be resolved
   still by the context. Here, where it is joined with encompassing, it is
   most fitly to be understood in the former sense, because ropes or cords
   are proper for that turn, as for holding and keeping in when they are
   inclosed." The Chaldee understands the word in the other sense, and
   paraphrases the clause thus: "Distress hath compassed me as a woman in
   travail which hath not strength to bring forth, and is in danger of
   death," The Septuagint adopts the same view, reading, "odines thanatou,
   the pangs of death."

   [396] Cocceius renders the words, "the waves of death," and he
   observes, that the words "waves'" explains the verb "compassed me
   about." Death sent its sorrows thick upon him one after another, as the
   sea sends forth its waves, and with such violence that he was ready to
   be overwhelmed. The word msvry, mishberey, is applied both to the
   breaking waves of the sea, (Psalm 42:7.) -- Ainsworth. Horsley
   translates the phrase, "The breakers of death." "The metaphor," says
   he, "is taken from those dangerous waves our mariners call white
   breakers."

   [397] Jerome doubtless derived the word from vly, beli, not or without,
   and vl, ol, a yoke, and thus the term Belial means those who shake off
   all restraint. Signifying to profit, or to gain advantage in any
   respect.

   [398] Belial is a compound term, significant of vileness and
   worthlessness.

   forward in impetuous torrents to overwhelm and destroy whatever opposes
   them." - Walford.

   Psalm 18:7-11

   7. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains
   were troubled, and were shaken, because he was wroth. 8. There went up
   a smoke by [or out of] his nostrils, and fire proceeding from his mouth
   devoured; coals were kindled by it. 9. And he bowed the heavens and
   came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. 10. He rode also upon
   a cherub, and did fly; and was carried upon the wings of the wind. 11.
   He made darkness his secret [or hiding] place; his pavilion [or tent]
   round about him was dark waters, and the clouds of the skies.


   7. Then the earth shook. David, convinced that the aid of God, which he
   had experienced, was of such a character, that it was impossible for
   him to extol it sufficiently and as it deserved, sets forth an image of
   it in the sky and the earth, as if he had said, It has been as visible
   as the changes which give different appearances to the sky and the
   earth. If natural things always flowed in an even and uniform course,
   the power of God would not be so perceptible. But when he changes the
   face of the sky by sudden rain, or by loud thunder, or by dreadful
   tempests, those who before were, as it were, asleep and insensible,
   must necessarily be awakened, and be tremblingly conscious of the
   existence of a presiding God. [400] Such sudden and unforeseen changes
   manifest more clearly the presence of the great Author of nature. No
   doubt, when the sky is unclouded and tranquil, we see in it sufficient
   evidences of the majesty of God, but as men will not stir up their
   minds to reflect upon that majesty, until it come nearer to them,
   David, the more powerfully to affect us, recounts the sudden changes by
   which we are usually moved and dismayed, and introduces God at one time
   clothed with a dark cloud, -- at another, throwing the air into
   confusion by tempests, -- now rending it by the boisterous violence of
   winds, -- now launching the lightnings, -- and anon darting down
   hailstones and thunderbolts. In short, the object of the Psalmist is to
   show that the God who, as often as he pleases, causes all parts of the
   world to tremble by his power, when he intended to manifest himself as
   the deliverer of David, was known as openly and by signs as evident as
   if he had displayed his power in all the creatures both above and
   beneath.

   In the first place, he says, The earth shook, and nothing is more
   dreadful than an earthquake. Instead of the words, the foundations of
   the mountains, it is in the song, as recorded in 2nd Samuel, the
   foundations of the heavens; but the meaning is the same, namely, that
   there was nothing in the world so settled and steadfast which did not
   tremble, and which was not removed out of its place. David, however, as
   I have already observed in the beginning, does not relate this as a
   piece of history, or as what had actually taken place, but he employs
   these similitudes for the purpose of removing all doubt, and for the
   greater confirmation of faith as to the power and providence of God;
   because men, from their slowness of understanding, cannot apprehend God
   except by means of external signs. Some think that these miracles were
   actually wrought, and performed exactly as they are here related; but
   it is not easy to believe this, since the Holy Spirit, in the narrative
   given of David's life, makes no mention whatever of such wonderful
   displays of divine power in his behalf. We cannot, however, justly
   censure or find fault with this hyperbolic manner of speaking, when we
   consider our slowness of apprehension, and also our depravity, to which
   I have just now called your attention. David, who was much more
   penetrating and quick of understanding than ordinary men, finding he
   could not sufficiently succeed in impressing and profiting people of
   sluggish and weak understandings by a simple manner of speaking,
   describes under outward figures the power of God, which he had
   discovered by means of faith, and the revelation of the Holy Spirit. He
   doubtless hereby apprehended and knew more distinctly the omnipresent
   majesty of God, than the dull sort of common people perceive the hand
   of God in earthquakes, tempests, thunders, the gloomy lowerings of the
   heavens, and the boisterous winds. At the same time, it is proper to
   consider, that although God had, in a wonderful manner, displayed his
   grace in defending and maintaining David, many, nevertheless, thought
   that it was by his own skill, or by chance, or by other natural means,
   that all his affairs had come to a prosperous issue; and it was such
   stupidity or depravity as this which he saw in the men of his own time,
   that constrained him to mention and to summon together all parts of
   creation as witnesses for God. Some also justly and judiciously
   consider that, in the whole of this description, David has an allusion
   to the common deliverance of God's chosen people from Egypt. As God
   then designed and established that event to be a perpetual memorial,
   from which the faithful might learn that he was the guardian and
   protector of their welfare, so all the benefits which, from that
   period, he bestowed upon his people, either as a public body or as
   private individuals, were, so to speak, appendages of that first
   deliverance. Accordingly David, in other places as well as here, with
   the view of exalting the succor which God had granted to his people,
   sets forth that most memorable instance of the goodness of God towards
   the children of Israel, as if it were the archtype or original copy of
   the grace of God. And surely, while many, seeing him an exile from his
   country, held him in derision as a man expelled from the family of God,
   and many murmured that he had violently and unrighteously usurped the
   kingdom, he had good ground to include, under the deliverance which had
   been common to all the people, the protection and safety which God had
   afforded to himself; as if he had said, I have been wrongfully cast off
   as an alien or stranger, seeing God has sufficiently shown, in the
   deliverance which he has wrought for me, that by him I am owned and
   acknowledged to be a distinguished and valuable member of the Church.
   We see how the prophets, whenever they would inspire the people with
   the hope of salvation, call their thoughts back to the contemplation of
   that first covenant which had been confirmed by those miracles which
   were wrought in Egypt, in the passage through the Red Sea and in Mount
   Sinai. When he says, The earth trembled, because he was wroth, it is to
   be understood as referring to the ungodly. It is a form of speech which
   God often employs, to say, that, being inflamed with indignation, he
   arms himself to maintain the safety of his people against their
   persecutors.

   8. There went up a smoke by [or out of] his nostrils, etc The Hebrew
   word 'ph, aph, properly signifies the nose, or the nostrils. But as it
   is sometimes taken metaphorically for wrath, some translate it thus,
   There went up a smoke in his wrath, which, in my opinion, is not at all
   appropriate. David compares the mists and vapours which darken the air
   to the thick smoke which a man sends forth from his nostrils when he is
   angry. And when God, by his very breath, covers the heaven with clouds,
   and taking away from us the brightness of the sun and of all the stars,
   overwhelms us in darkness, by this we are very impressively taught how
   dreadful is his wrath. By the rendering which I have given, the figure
   here strikingly harmonises with the one in the clause which immediately
   follows, namely, that fire proceeding from his mouth consumed The
   Psalmist means, that God, without great labor or effort, as soon as he
   shall have sent forth a breath or blast from his nostrils, and opened
   his mouth, will kindle such a fire that its smoke will darken the whole
   world, and its intense heat devour it. What he adds, Coals were kindled
   by it, serves to distinguish this dreadful fire from a flame which
   blazes for a moment, and then is extinguished. The bowing of the
   heavens, denotes a time when the heavens are covered and obscured with
   clouds. When dense vapours occupy the middle of the air, the clouds
   seem to us to come down and to lie upon our heads. And not only so, but
   the majesty of God then approaching, as it were, nearer us, strikes us
   with dread dismay, and greatly distresses us, although before, when the
   sky was fair, agreeable, and tranquil, we took ample scope, and enjoyed
   ourselves with much gaiety. Again, let us remember, that the Scripture,
   under these descriptions of a clouded and darkened sky, pourtray to us
   the anger of God. When the sky is clear and unclouded, it seems as if
   it were the pleasant and benignant countenance of God beaming upon us,
   and causing us to rejoice; whereas, on the other hand, when the
   atmosphere is troubled, we feel a depression of the animal spirits
   which constrains us to look sad, as if we saw God coming against us
   with a threatening aspect. At the same time, we are taught that no
   change takes place either in the atmosphere or in the earth, but what
   is a witness to us of the presence of God.

   10. He rode also upon a cherub. The Psalmist having exhibited to us a
   sign of the wrath of God in the clouds, and in the darkening of the
   air, representing him as if he breathed out smoke, [401] from his
   nostrils, and descended with a threatening countenance, to afflict men
   by the dreadful weight of his power; and having also represented
   lightnings and thunderbolts as flaming fire proceeding from his mouths
   -- he now introduces him as riding upon the winds and tempests, to take
   a survey of the whole world with rapid speed, or rather with the
   swiftness of flying. We meet with a similar description in Psalm 104:3,
   where God is said to "walk upon the wings of the winds," and to send
   them forth in every direction as his swift messengers. David does not,
   however, simply represent God as the governor of the winds, who drives
   them by his power whithersoever he pleases; he at the same time tells
   us that he rides upon a cherub, to teach us that the very violence of
   the winds is governed by angels as God has ordained. We know that the
   angels were represented under the figure of the cherubim. David,
   therefore, I have no doubt, here intended to make an allusion to the
   ark of the covenant. In proposing for our consideration the power of
   God as manifested in the wonders of nature, he does it in such a manner
   as all the time to have an eye to the temple, where he knew God had
   made himself known in a peculiar manner to the children of Abraham. He
   therefore celebrates God not only as creator of the world, but as He
   who entered into covenant with Israel, and chose for himself a holy
   dwelling-place in the midst of that people. David might have called the
   angels by their common name, but he has expressly made use of a term
   which has a reference to the visible symbol of the ark, that true
   believers, in singing this psalm, might always have their minds
   directed to the service of God which was performed in the temple. What
   follows with respect, to God's dark pavilion or tent, is a repetition
   of the preceding sentence in different words, namely, that when God
   covers the air with dark clouds, it is as if he spread a thick veil
   between him and men, to deprive them of the sight of his countenance,
   [402] just as if a king, incensed against his subjects, should retire
   into his secret chamber and hide himself from them. Those take a
   mistaken view of this verse who bring it forward to prove, in general,
   the hidden and mysterious character of the glory of God, as if David,
   with the view of restraining the presumption of human curiosity, had
   said that God is hidden in darkness in regard to men. God, it is true,
   is said to dwell in the light which no man can approach unto" (1
   Timothy 6:16;) but the form of expression which David here employs, I
   have no doubt, ought to be restricted, according to the scope of the
   passage, to the sense which I have given.

   Psalm 18:12-19

   12. At the brightness which was before him, his clouds passed away;
   there was hail-storm and coals of fire. 13. Jehovah thundered in the
   heavens, and the Highest sent forth his voice; there was hail-storm and
   coals of fire. 14. He sent out his arrows, and scattered them, [or put
   them to flight;] he multiplied lightnings, [403] and put them into
   confusion. 15. The sources of the waters were seen, and the foundations
   of the world were disclosed at thy rebuke, O Jehovah! at the blast of
   the breath of thy nostrils. [404] 16. He sent from on high, he took me,
   and drew me out of great waters. 17. He delivered me from my strong
   enemy, and from my adversary; for they were too strong for me. 18. They
   had prevented me in the day of my calamity; but Jehovah was my support.
   19. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
   because he had a good will to me, [or because he loved me.]


   12. At the brightness, etc. The Psalmist again returns to the
   lightnings which, by dividing and as it were cleaving the clouds, lay
   open the heaven; and, therefore, he says, that the clouds of God (that
   is to say, those which he had set before him, in token of his anger,
   for the purpose of depriving men of the enjoyment of the light of his
   countenance) passed away at the brightness which was before him These
   sudden changes affect us with a much more lively sense of the power and
   agency of God than natural phenomena which move on in one uniform
   course. He adds, that there followed hail-storm and coals of fire; for
   when the thunder separates and rends asunder the clouds, it either
   breaks out in lightnings, or the clouds resolve themselves into hail.

   13. Jehovah thundered. David here repeats the same thing in different
   words, declaring that God thundered from heaven; and he calls the
   thunder the yoke of God, that we may not suppose it is produced merely
   by chance or by natural causes, independent of the appointment and will
   of God. Philosophers, it is true, are well acquainted with the
   intermediate or secondary causes, from which the thunder proceeds,
   namely, that when the cold and humid vapours obstruct the dry and hot
   exhalations in their course upwards, a collision takes place, and by
   this, together with the noise of the clouds rushing against each other,
   is produced the rumbling thunder-peal. [405] But David, in describing
   the phenomena of the atmosphere, rises, under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, above the mere phenomena themselves, and represents God to us
   as the supreme governor of the whole, who, at his will, penetrates into
   the hidden veins of the earth, and thence draws forth exhalations; who
   then, dividing them into different sorts, disperses them through the
   air; who again collects the vapours together, and sets them in conflict
   with the subtile and dry heats, so that the thunder which follows seems
   to be a loud pealing voice proceeding from his own mouth. The song in
   2nd Samuel also contains the repetition to which we have referred in
   the commencement of our remarks on this verse; but the sense of this
   and the preceding verse, and of the corresponding verses in Samuel, are
   entirely similar. We should remember what I have said before, that
   David, under these figures, describes to us the dreadful power of God,
   the better to exalt and magnify the divine grace, which was manifested
   in his deliverance. He declares a little after, that this was his
   intention; for, when speaking of his enemies, he says, (verse 14,) that
   they were scattered, or put to flight, by the arrows of God; as if he
   had said, They have been overthrown, not by the hands or swords of men,
   but by God, who openly launched his thunderbolts against them. Not that
   he means to affirm that this happened literally, but he speaks in this
   metaphorical language, because those who were uninstructed and slow to
   acknowledge the power of God, [406] could not otherwise be brought to
   perceive that God was the author of his deliverance. The import of his
   words is, Whoever does not acknowledge that I have been preserved by
   the hand of God, may as well deny that it is God who thunders from
   heaven, and abolish his power which is manifested in the whole order of
   nature, and especially in those wonderful changes which we see taking
   place in the atmosphere. As God shoots lightnings as if they were
   arrows, the Psalmist has, in the first place, employed this metaphor;
   and then he has expressed the thing simply by its proper name.

   15. And the sources of the waters were seen. In this verse, David
   doubtless alludes to the miracle which was wrought when the chosen
   tribes passed through the Red Sea. I have before declared the purpose
   for which he does this. As all the special benefits which God in old
   time conferred upon any of the children of Abraham as individuals, were
   so many testimonies by which he recalled to their remembrance the
   covenant which he had once entered into with the whole people, to
   assure them that he would always continue his grace towards them, and
   that one deliverance might be to them a token or pledge of their
   perpetual safety, and of the protection of God, David fitly conjoins
   with that ancient deliverance of the Church the assistance which God
   had sent from heaven to him in particular. As the grace which he
   declares God had shown towards him was not to be separated from that
   first deliverance, since it was, so to speak, a part and an appendage
   of it, he beholds, as it were at a glance, or in an instant, both the
   ancient miracle of the drying up of the Red Sea, and the assistance
   which God granted to himself. In short, God, who once opened up for his
   people a way through the Red Sea, and then showed himself to be their
   protector upon this condition, that they should assure themselves of
   being always maintained and preserved under his keeping, now again
   displayed his wonderful power in the defense and preservation of one
   man, to renew the remembrance of that ancient history. From this it
   appears the more evidently, that David, in using these apparently
   strange and exaggerated hyperboles, does not recite to us the mere
   creations of romance to please the fancy, after the manner of the
   heathen poets, [407] but observes the style and manner which God had,
   as it were, prescribed to his people. At the same time, we ought
   carefully to mark the reason already adverted to, which constrained him
   to magnify the grace of God in a style of such splendid imagery,
   namely, because the greater part of the people never made the grace of
   God the subject of serious consideration, but, either through
   wickedness or stupidity, passed over it with shut eyes. The Hebrew word
   'phyqym, aphikim, which I have rendered sources, properly signifies the
   channels of rivers; but David, in this passage, evidently means that
   the very springs or sources of the waters were laid open, and that thus
   it could be discerned whence proceeds the great and inexhaustible
   abundance of waters which supply the rivers, and by which they always
   continue to flow on in their course.

   16. He sent down from above. Here there is briefly shown the drift of
   the sublime and magnificent narrative which has now passed under our
   review, namely, to teach us that David at length emerged from the
   profound abyss of his troubles, neither by his own skill, nor by the
   aid of men, but that he was drawn out of them by the hand of God. When
   God defends and preserves us wonderfully and by extraordinary means, he
   is said in Scripture language to send down succor from above; and this
   sending is set in opposition to human and earthly aids, on which we
   usually place a mistaken and an undue confidence. I do not disapprove
   of the opinion of those who consider this as referring to the angels,
   but I understand it in a more general sense; for by whatever means we
   are preserved, it is God who having his creatures ready at his nod to
   do his will, appoints them to take charge of us, and girds or prepares
   them for succouring us. But, although every kind of aid comes from
   heaven, David, with good reason, affirms that God had stretched out his
   hand from on high to deliver him. In speaking thus, he meant to place
   the astonishing benefit referred to, by way of eminence, above others
   of a more common kind; and besides, there is in this expression a tacit
   comparison between the unusual exercise of the power of God here
   celebrated, and the common and ordinary means by which he succours his
   people. When he says, that God drew him out of great waters, it is a
   metaphorical form of expression. By comparing the cruelty of his
   enemies to impetuous torrents, by which he might have been swallowed up
   a hundred times, he expresses more clearly the greatness of the danger;
   as if he had said, I have, contrary to the expectation of men, escaped,
   and been delivered from a deep abyss in which I was ready to be
   overwhelmed. In the following verse he expresses the thing simply and
   without a figure, declaring that he had been delivered from a strong
   enemy, [408] who mortally hated and persecuted him. The more to exalt
   and magnify the power of God, he directs our attention to this
   circumstance, that no strength or power of men had been able to prevent
   God from saving him, even when he was reduced to the greatest extremity
   of distress. As in the end of the verse there is the Hebrew particle
   ky, ki, which generally denotes the cause of what is predicated, almost
   all interpreters agree in explaining the verse thus: God has succoured
   me from above, because my enemies were so numerous and so strong that
   no relief was to be expected by the mere aid of men. From this we
   deduce a very profitable doctrine, namely, that the most seasonable
   time for God to aid his people is when they are unable to sustain the
   assaults of their enemies, or rather, when, broken and afflicted, they
   sink under their violence, like the wretched man who having in a
   shipwreck lost all hope of being able to swim to the shore, sinks with
   great rapidity to the bottom of the deep. The particle yk, ki, however,
   might also be explained by the adversative particle although, in this
   way: Although the enemies of David were superior to him in number and
   power, he nevertheless was saved.

   18. They had prevented me in the day of my calamity. [409] The Psalmist
   here confirms in different words the preceding sentence, namely, that
   he had been sustained by the aid of God, when there was no way of
   escaping by the power of man. He tells us how he had been besieged on
   all sides, and that not by an ordinary siege, inasmuch as his enemies,
   in persecuting him, always molested him most in the time of his
   calamity. From this circumstance it is the more evident that he had
   obtained enlargement by no other means than by the hand of God. Whence
   proceeded so sudden a restoration from death to life, but because God
   intended to show that he has in his hand, and under his absolute
   control, the issues of death? In short, the Psalmist ascribes his
   deliverance to no other cause than the mere good pleasure of God, that
   all the praise might redound to him alone: He delivered me, because he
   loved me, or had a good will to me. In mentioning the good pleasure of
   God, he has a special respect to his own calling to be king. The point
   on which he principally insisted is, that the assaults which were made
   upon him, and the conflicts which he had to sustain, were stirred up
   against him for no other reason but because he had obeyed the call of
   God, and followed with humble obedience the revelation of his oracle.
   Ambitious and turbulent men, who are carried headlong by their unruly
   lusts, inconsiderately to attempt any thing, and who, by their
   rashness, involve themselves in dangers, may often accomplish their
   undertakings by vigorous and resolute efforts, but at length a reverse
   takes place, and they are stopt short in their career of success, for
   they are unworthy of being sustained and prospered by God, since,
   without having any warrant or foundation for what they do in his call,
   they would raise their insane structures even to heaven, and disturb
   all around them. In short, David testifies, by this expression, that
   the assistance of God had never failed him, because he had not thrust
   himself into the office of king of his own accord, but that when he was
   contented with his humble condition, and would willingly have lived in
   obscurity, in the sheep-cotes, or in his father's hut, he had been
   anointed by the hand of Samuel, which was the symbol of his free
   election by God to fill the throne.

   [403] In our English version it is, He shot out lightnings. The Hebrew
   word rvv, rabab, signifies both to multiply and to shoot. As the
   shooting of arrows is mentioned in the first clause of the verse, it
   may be presumed that it is the shooting of lightnings which is meant in
   the second clause, arrows and lightnings being contrasted. The reading
   of the Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic
   versions, however, is the same as that of Calvin, -- He multiplied
   lightnings.

   Psalm 18:20-24

   20. Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; he recompensed
   me according to the cleanness of my hands. 21. For I have kept the ways
   of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 22. For all his
   judgments were before me, nor did I put away his statutes [or
   ordinances] from me. 23. I was also upright with him, [410] and kept
   myself from my iniquity. 24. Therefore Jehovah hath recompensed me
   according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands
   before his eyes.


   20. Jehovah rewarded me. David might seem at first sight to contradict
   himself; for, while a little before he declared that all the blessings
   which he possessed were to be traced to the good pleasure of God, he
   now boasts that God rendered to him a just recompense. But if we
   remember for what purpose he connects these commendations of his own
   integrity with the good pleasure of God, it will be easy to reconcile
   these apparently conflicting statements. He has before declared that
   God was the sole author and originator of the hope of coming to the
   kingdom which he entertained, and that he had not been elevated to it
   by the suffrages of men, nor had he rushed forward to it through the
   mere impulse of his own mind, but accepted it because such was the will
   of God. Now he adds, in the second place, that he had yielded faithful
   obedience to God, and had never turned aside from his will. Both these
   things were necessary; first, that God should previously show his favor
   freely towards David, in choosing him to be king; and next, that David,
   on the other hand, should, with an obedient spirit, and a pure
   conscience, receive the kingdom which God thus freely gave him; and
   farther, that whatever the wicked might attempt, with the view of
   overthrowing or shaking his faith, he should nevertheless continue to
   adhere to the direct course of his calling. Thus, then, we see that
   these two statements, so far from disagreeing with each other,
   admirably harmonise. David here represents God as if the president
   [411] of a combat, under whose authority and conduct he had been
   brought forth to engage in the combats. Now that depended upon
   election, in other words, upon this, that God having embraced him with
   his favor, had created him king. He adds in the verses which
   immediately follow, that he had faithfully performed the duties of the
   charge and office committed to him even to the uttermost. It is not,
   therefore, wonderful if God maintained and protected David, and even
   showed, by manifest miracles, that he was the defender of his own
   champion, [412] whom he had, of his own free choice, admitted to the
   combat, and who he saw had performed his duty with all fidelity. We
   ought not, however, to think that David, for the sake of obtaining
   praise among men, has here purposely indulged in the language of vain
   boasting; we ought rather to view the Holy Spirit as intending by the
   mouth of David to teach us the profitable doctrine, that the aid of God
   will never fail us, provided we follow our calling, keep ourselves
   within the limits which it prescribes, and undertake nothing without
   the command or warrant of God. At the same time, let this truth be
   deeply fixed in our minds, that we can only begin an upright course of
   life when God of his good pleasure adopts us into his family, and in
   effectually calling, anticipates us by his grace, without which neither
   we nor any creature would give him an opportunity of bestowing this
   blessing upon us. [413]

   There, however, still remains one question. If God rendered to David a
   just recompense, it may be said, does it not seem, when he shows
   himself liberal towards his people, that he is so in proportion as each
   of them has deserved? I answer, When the Scripture uses the word reward
   or recompense, it is not to show that God owes us any thing, and it is
   therefore a groundless and false conclusion to infer from this that
   there is any merit or worth in works. God, as a just judge, rewards
   every man according to his works, but he does it in such a manner, as
   to show that all men are indebted to him, while he himself is under
   obligation to no one. The reason is not only that which St Augustine
   has assigned, namely, that God finds no righteousness in us to
   recompense, except what he himself has freely given us, but also
   because, forgiving the blemishes and imperfections which cleave to our
   works, he imputes to us for righteousness that which he might justly
   reject. If, therefore, none of our works please God, unless the sin
   which mingles with them is pardoned, it follows, that the recompense
   which he bestows on account of them proceeds not from our merit, but
   from his free and undeserved grace. We ought, however, to attend to the
   special reason why David here speaks of God rewarding him according to
   his righteousness. He does not presumptuously thrust himself into the
   presence of God, trusting to or depending upon his own obedience to the
   law as the ground of his justification; but knowing that God approved
   the affection of his heart, and wishing to defend and acquit himself
   from the false and wicked calumnies of his enemies, he makes God
   himself the judge of his cause. We know how unjustly and shamefully he
   had been loaded with false accusations, and yet these calumnies did not
   so much bear against the honor and name of David as against the welfare
   and estate of the whole Church in common. It was indeed mere private
   spite which stirred up Saul, and drove him into fury against David, and
   it was to please the king that all other men were so rancorous against
   an innocent individual, and broke forth so outrageously against him;
   but Satan, there is no doubt, had a prime agency in exciting these
   formidable assaults upon the kingdom of David, and by them he
   endeavored to accomplish his ruin, because in the person of this one
   man God had placed, and, as it were, shut up the hope of the salvation
   of the whole people. This is the reason why David labors so carefully
   and so earnestly to show and to maintain the righteousness of his
   cause. When he presents and defends himself before the judgment-seat of
   God against his enemies, the question is not concerning the whole
   course of his life, but only respecting one certain cause, or a
   particular point. We ought, therefore, to attend to the precise subject
   of his discourse, and what he here debates. The state of the matter is
   this: His adversaries charged him with many crimes; first, of rebellion
   and treason, accusing him of having revolted from the king his
   father-in-law; in the second place, of plunder and robbery, as if, like
   a robber, he had taken possession of the kingdom; thirdly, of sedition,
   as if he had thrown the kingdom into confusion when it enjoyed
   tranquillity; and, lastly, of cruelty and many flagitious actions, as
   if he had been the cause of murders, and had prosecuted his conspiracy
   by many dangerous means and unlawful artifices. David, in opposition to
   these accusations, with the view of maintaining his innocence before
   God, protests and affirms that he had acted uprightly and sincerely in
   this matter, inasmuch as he attempted nothing without the command or
   warrant of God; and whatever hostile attempts his enemies made against
   him, he nevertheless always kept himself within the bounds prescribed
   by the Divine Law. It would be absurd to draw from this the inference
   that God is merciful to men according as he judges them to be worthy of
   his favor. Here the object in view is only to show the goodness of a
   particular cause, and to maintain it in opposition to wicked
   calumniators; and not to bring into examination the whole life of a
   man, that he may obtain favor, and be pronounced righteous before God.
   In short, David concludes from the effect and the issue, that his cause
   was approved of by God, not that one victory is always and necessarily
   the sign of a good cause, but because God, by evident tokens of his
   assistance, showed that he was on the side of David.

   21. For I have kept the ways of Jehovah. He had spoken in the preceding
   verse of the cleanness of his hands, but finding that men judged of him
   perversely, and were very active in spreading evil reports concerning
   him, [414] he affirms that he had kept the ways of the Lord, which is
   equivalent to his appealing the matter to the judgment-seat of God.
   Hypocrites, it is true, are accustomed confidently to appeal to God in
   the same way; yea, there is nothing which they are more forward in
   doing than in dallying with the sacred name of God, and making it a
   cover to conceal their hypocrisy; but David brings forward nothing
   which men might not have certainly known to be true, if any regard to
   justice had existed among them. Let us, therefore, from his example,
   endeavor above all things to have a good conscience. And, in the second
   place, let us have the magnanimity to despise the false judgments of
   men, and to look up to heaven for the vindicator of our character and
   cause. He adds, I have not wickedly departed from my God This implies,
   that he always aimed directly at the mark of his calling, although the
   ungodly attempted many things to overthrow his faith. The verb which he
   uses does not denote one fall only, but a defection which utterly
   removes and alienates a man from God. David, it is true, sometimes fell
   into sin through the weakness of the flesh, but he never desisted from
   following after godliness, nor deserted the service to which God had
   called him.

   22. For all his judgments were before me. He now shows how he came to
   possess that unbending rectitude of character, by which he was enabled
   to act uprightly amidst so many and so grievous temptations, namely,
   because he always applied his mind to the study of the law of God. As
   Satan is daily making new assaults upon us, it is necessary for us to
   have recourse to arms, and it is meditation upon the Divine Law which
   furnishes us with armor to resist. Whoever, therefore, would desire to
   persevere in uprightness and integrity of life, let them learn to
   exercise themselves daily in the study of the word of God; for,
   whenever a man despises or neglects instruction, he easily falls into
   carelessness and stupidity, and all fear of God vanishes from his mind.
   I do not intend here to make any subtle distinction between these two
   words, judgments and ordinances. If, however, any person is inclined to
   make a distinction between them, the best distinction is to refer
   judgments to the second table of the law, and ordinances, or statutes,
   which in Hebrew are called chvkvt, chukoth, to the duties of piety and
   the exercises immediately connected with the worship of God.

   23. I was also upright with him. All the verbs in this verse are put by
   David in the future tense, I will be upright, etc. because he does not
   boast of one act only, or of a good work performed by fits and starts,
   but of steady perseverance in an upright course. What I have said
   before, namely, that David takes God for his judge, as he saw that he
   was wrongfully and unrighteously condemned by men, appears still more
   clearly from what he here says, "I have been upright with him." The
   Scriptures, indeed, sometimes speak in similar terms of the saints, to
   distinguish them from hypocrites, who content themselves with wearing
   the outward mask of religious observances; but it is to disprove the
   false reports which were spread against him that David thus confidently
   appeals to God with respect to them. This is still more fully confirmed
   by the repetition of the same thing which is made a little after,
   According to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes In these words
   there is evidently a contrast between the eyes of God and the blinded
   or malignant eyes of the world; as if he had said, I disregard false
   and wicked calumnies, provided I am pure and upright in the sight of
   God, whose judgment can never be perverted by malevolent or other
   vicious and perverse affections. Moreover, the integrity which he
   attributes to himself is not perfection but sincerity, which is opposed
   to dissimulation and hypocrisy. This may be gathered from the last
   clause of the 23rd verse, where he says, I have kept myself from my
   iniquity In thus speaking, he tacitly acknowledges that he had not been
   so pure and free from sinful affections as that the malignity of his
   enemies did not frequently excite indignation within him, and gall him
   to the heart. He had therefore to fight in his own mind against many
   temptations, for as he was a man, he must have felt in the flesh on
   many occasions the stirrings of vexation and anger. But this was the
   proof of his virtue, that he imposed a restraint upon himself, and
   refrained from whatever he knew to be contrary to the word of God. A
   man will never persevere in the practice of uprightness and of
   godliness, unless he carefully keep himself from his iniquity.

   Psalm 18:25-27

   25. With the merciful thou wilt deal mercifully, [415] with an upright
   man thou wilt show thyself upright. 26. With the pure [416] thou wilt
   be pure, and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself perverse. 27 For
   thou wilt save the afflicted people, [417] and wilt bring down the
   haughty eyes. [418]


   25. With the merciful, etc. David here prosecutes the same subject. In
   considering the grace of God by which he had been delivered, he brings
   it forward as a proof of his integrity, and thus triumphs over the
   unfounded and disgraceful calumnies of his enemies. Hypocrites, I
   confess, are also accustomed to act in the same way; for prosperity and
   the success of their affairs so elates them that they are not ashamed
   proudly to vaunt themselves not only against men, but even against God.
   As such persons, however, openly mock God, when, by his long-suffering,
   he allures them to repentance, their wicked and unhappy presumption has
   no resemblance to the boasting by which we here see David encouraging
   himself. He does not abuse the forbearance and mercy of God by
   palliating or spreading a specious varnish over his iniquities, because
   God bears with them; but having, by the manifold aids he had received
   from God, experienced beyond doubt that he was merciful to him, he
   justly viewed them as evident testimonies of the divine favor towards
   him. And we ought to mark well this difference between the ungodly and
   the faithful, namely, that the former, intoxicated with prosperity,
   unblushingly boast of being acceptable to God, while yet they disregard
   him, and rather sacrifice to Fortune, and make it their God; [419]
   whereas the latter in their prosperity magnify the grace of God, from
   the deep sense of his grace with which their consciences are affected.
   Thus David here boasts that God had succoured him on account of the
   justice of his cause. For, in the first place, we must adapt the words
   to the scope of the whole discourse, and view them as implying that
   God, in so often delivering an innocent man from death, when it was
   near him, showed, indeed, that he is merciful towards the merciful, and
   pure towards the pure. In the second place, we must view the words as
   teaching the general doctrine, that God never disappoints his servants,
   but always at length deals graciously with them, provided they wait for
   his aid with meekness and patience. To this purpose Jacob said, in
   Genesis 30:33,

   "God will make my righteousness to return upon me."

   The scope of the discourse is, that the people of God should entertain
   good hope, and encourage themselves to practice uprightness and
   integrity, since every man shall reap the fruit of his own
   righteousness.

   The last clause of the 26th verse, where it is said, With the perverse
   thou wilt show thyself perverse, seems to convey a meaning somewhat
   strange, but it does not imply any thing absurd; yea, rather, it is not
   without good reason that the Holy Spirit uses this manner of speaking;
   for he designs thereby to awaken hypocrites and the gross despisers of
   God, who lull themselves asleep in their vices without any apprehension
   of danger. [420] We see how such persons, when the Scripture proclaims
   the sore and dreadful judgments of God, and when also God himself
   denounces terrible vengeance, pass over all these things, without
   giving themselves any trouble about them. Accordingly, this brutish,
   and, as it were, monstrous stupidity which we see in men, compels God
   to invent new forms of expression, and, as it were, to clothe himself
   with a different character. There is a similar sentence in Leviticus
   26:21-24, where God says, "And if ye walk contrary unto [or perversely
   with] me, then will I also walk contrary unto [or perversely or
   roughly, or at random against] you;" as if he had said, that their
   obstinacy and stubbornness would make him on his part forget his
   accustomed forbearance and gentleness, and cast himself recklessly or
   at random against them. [421] We see, then, what the stubborn at length
   gain by their obduracy; it is this, that God hardens himself still more
   to break them in pieces, and if they are of stone, he causes them to
   feel that he has the hardness of iron. Another reason which we may
   assign for this manner of speaking is, that the Holy Spirit, in
   addressing his discourse to the wicked, commonly speaks according to
   their own apprehension. When God thunders in good earnest upon them,
   they transform him, through the blind terrors which seize upon them,
   into a character different from his real one, inasmuch as they conceive
   of nothing as entering into it but barbarity, cruelty, and ferocity. We
   now see the reason why David does not simply attribute to God the name
   and office of judge, but introduces him as armed with impetuous
   violence, for resisting and overcoming the perverse, according as it is
   said in the common proverb, A tough knot requires a stout wedge.

   27. For thou wilt save the afflicted people. This verse contains the
   correction of a mistake into which we are very ready to fall. As
   experience shows that the merciful are often severely afflicted, and
   the sincere involved in troubles of a very distressing description, to
   prevent any from regarding the statement as false that God deals
   mercifully with the merciful, David admonishes us that we must wait for
   the end; for although God does not immediately run to succor the good,
   yet, after having exercised their patience for a time, he lifts them up
   from the dust on which they lay prostrate, and brings effectual relief
   to them, even when they were in despair. Whence it follows, that we
   ought only to judge by the issue how God shows himself merciful towards
   the merciful and pure towards the pure. If he did not keep his people
   in suspense and waiting long for deliverance from affliction, it could
   not be said that it is his prerogative to save the afflicted. And it is
   no small consolation, in the midst of our adversities, to know that God
   purposely delays to communicate his assistance, which otherwise is
   quite prepared, that we may experience his goodness in saving us after
   we have been afflicted and brought low. [422] Nor ought we to reckon
   the wrongs which are inflicted upon us too bitter, since they excite
   God to show towards us his favor which bringeth salvation. As to the
   second clause of this verse, the reading is a little different in the
   song in the 2nd Book of Samuel, where the words are, Thine eyes are
   against the proud to cast them down. But this difference makes no
   alteration as to the meaning, except that the Holy Spirit there more
   plainly threatens the proud, that, as God is on the watch to overthrow
   them, it is impossible for them to escape destruction. The substance of
   both places is this: The more the ungodly indulge in gratifying their
   own inclinations, without any fear of danger, and the more proudly they
   despise the afflicted poor who are under their feet, they are so much
   the nearer to destruction. Whenever, therefore, they cruelly break
   forth against us with mockery and contempt, let us know that there is
   nothing which prevents God from repelling their headstrong pertinacity,
   but that their pride is not yet come to its height.

   Psalm 18:28-32

   28. For thou shalt light my lamp, O Jehovah; my God shall enlighten my
   darkness. 29. For by thee [423] I shall break through the wedge [424]
   of a troop, and by my God I shall leap over a wall. 30. The way of God
   is perfect; the word of Jehovah is refined, [or purified;] he is a
   shield to all those who trust in him. 31. For who is God besides
   Jehovah? and who is strong except our God? 32. It is God who hath
   girded me with strength, and hath made my way perfect.


   28. For thou shalt light my lamp. In the song in Samuel, the form of
   the expression is somewhat more precise; for there it is said not that
   God lights our lamp, but that he himself is our lamp. The meaning,
   however, comes to the same thing, namely, that it was by the grace of
   God that David, who had been plunged in darkness, returned to the
   light. David does not simply give thanks to God for having lighted up a
   lamp before him, but also for having converted his darkness into light.
   He, therefore, acknowledges that he had been reduced to such extremity
   of distress, that he was like a man whose condition was forlorn and
   hopeless; for he compares the confused and perplexed state of his
   affairs to darkness. This, indeed, by the transference of material
   things to things spiritual, may be applied to the spiritual
   illumination of the understanding; but, at the same time, we must
   attend to the subject of which David treats, that we may not depart
   from the true and proper meaning. Now, as he acknowledges that he had
   been restored to prosperity by the favor of God, which was to him, as
   it were, a life-giving light, let us, after his example, regard it as
   certain that we will never have the comfort of seeing our adversities
   brought to an end, unless God disperse the darkness which envelops us,
   and restore to us the light of joy. Let it not, however, be distressing
   to us to walk through darkness, provided God is pleased to perform to
   us the office of a lamp. In the following verse, David ascribes his
   victories to God, declaring that, under his conduct, he had broken
   through the wedges or phalanxes of his enemies, and had taken by storm
   their fortified cities. [425] Thus we see that, although he was a
   valiant warrior, and skilled in arms, he arrogates nothing to himself.
   As to the tenses of the verbs, we would inform our readers once for
   all, that in this psalm David uses the past and the future tenses
   indifferently, not only because he comprehends different histories, but
   also because he presents to himself the things of which he speaks as if
   they were still taking place before his eyes, and, at the same time,
   describes a continued course of the grace of God towards him.

   30. The way of God is perfect. The phrase, The way of God, is not here
   taken for his revealed will, but for his method of dealing towards his
   people. The meaning, therefore, is, that God never disappoints or
   deceives his servants, nor forsakes them in the time of need, (as may
   be the case with men who do not aid their dependants, except in so far
   as it contributes to their own particular advantage,) but faithfully
   defends and maintains those whom he has once taken under his
   protection. But we will never have any nearness to God, unless he first
   come near to us by his word; and, for this reason, David, after having
   asserted that God aids his people in good earnest, adds, at the same
   time, that his word is purified. Let us, therefore, rest assured that
   God will actually show himself upright towards us, seeing he has
   promised to be the guardian and protector of our welfare, and his
   promise is certain and infallible truth. That by the word we are not
   here to understand the commandments, but the promises of God, is easily
   gathered from the following clause, where it is said, He is a shield to
   all those who trust in him It seems, indeed, a common commendation to
   say, that the word of God is pure, and without any mixture of fraud and
   deceit, like silver which is well refined and purified from all its
   dross. But our unbelief is the cause why God, so to speak, is
   constrained to use such a similitude, for the purpose of commending and
   leading us to form exalted conceptions of the steadfastness and
   certainty of his promises; for whenever the issue does not answer our
   expectation, there is nothing to which we are naturally more prone than
   forthwith to begin to entertain unhallowed and distrustful thoughts of
   the word of God. For a farther explanation of these words, we would
   refer our readers to our [8]remarks on Psalm 12:6.

   31. For who is God besides Jehovah? David here, deriding the foolish
   inventions of men, who, according to their own fancy, make for
   themselves tutelary gods, [426] confirms what I have said before, that
   he never undertook any thing but by the authority and command of God.
   If he had passed beyond the limits of his calling, he could not with
   such confidence have said that God was on his side. Besides, although
   in these words he opposes to the true God all the false gods invented
   by men, his purpose, at the same time, is to overthrow all the vain
   hopes in which the world is wrapped up, and by which it is carried
   about, and prevented from resting in God. The question which David here
   treats of is not the bare title and name of God, but he declares that
   whatever assistance we need we should seek it from God, and from no
   other quarter, because he alone is endued with power: Who is strong
   except our God? We should, however, attend to the design of David,
   which I have first adverted to, namely, that, by confidently
   representing God as opposed to all his enemies, and as the leader,
   under whose standard he had valiantly fought against them, he means to
   affirm that he had attempted nothing according to his own fancy, or
   with an evil and condemning conscience.

   32. It is God who hath girded. This is a metaphor taken either from the
   belt or girdle of a warrior, or from the reins, in which the Scripture
   sometimes places a man's vigor or strength. It is, therefore, as if he
   had said, I, who would otherwise have been feeble and effeminate, have
   been made strong and courageous by the power of God. He afterwards
   speaks of the success itself with which God had favored him; for it
   would not be enough for persons to have prompt and active courage, nor
   even to excel in strength, if their undertakings were not at the same
   time crowned with a prosperous issue. Irreligious men imagine that this
   proceeds from their own prudence, or from fortune; but David ascribes
   it to God alone: It is God who hath made my way perfect. The word way
   is here to be understood of the course of our actions, and the language
   implies, that whatever David undertook, God, by his blessing, directed
   it to a successful issue.

   Psalm 18:33-36

   33. Making my feet like hinds' [427] feet, and he hath set me upon my
   high places. 34. Teaching my hands to war: and a bow of steel [428]
   will be broken by my arms. 35. Thou hast also given me the shield of
   thy salvation; and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy clemency
   hath increased me. 36. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my
   feet have not staggered.


   David, having taken many strongholds which, on account of their steep
   and difficult access, were believed to be impregnable, extols the grace
   of God in this particular. When he says that God had given him feet
   like hinds' feet, he means that he had given him unusual swiftness, and
   such as does not naturally belong to men. The sense, therefore, is,
   that he had been aided by God in an extraordinary manner, so that like
   a roe he climbed with amazing speed over inaccessible rocks. He calls
   the strongholds, which, as conqueror, he had obtained by right of war,
   his high places; for he could justly boast that he took possession of
   nothing which belonged to another man, inasmuch as he knew that he had
   been called to occupy these fortresses by God. When he says that his
   hands had been taught and framed to war, he confesses that he had not
   acquired his dexterity in fighting by his own skill, nor by exercise
   and experience, but had obtained it as a gift through the singular
   goodness of God. It is true in general, that strength and skill in war
   proceed only from a secret virtue communicated by God; but David
   immediately after shows that he had been furnished with greater
   strength for carrying on his wars than what men commonly possess,
   inasmuch as his arms were sufficiently strong to break even bows of
   brass in pieces True, he had by nature a vigorous and powerful bodily
   frame; but the Scripture describes him as a man of low stature, and the
   similitude itself which he here uses implies something surpassing the
   natural strength of man. In the following verse, he declares that it
   was by the grace of God alone that he had escaped, and been kept in
   perfect safety: Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation. By
   the phrase, the shield of God's salvation, he intimates, that if God
   had not wonderfully preserved him, he would have been exposed
   unprotected to many deadly wounds; and thus God's shield of salvation
   is tacitly opposed to all the coverings and armor with which he had
   been provided. He again ascribes his safety to the free goodness of God
   as its cause, which he says had increased him, or more and more carried
   him forward in the path of honor and success; for, by the word
   increase, he means a continuation and an unintermitted and ever growing
   augmentation of the tokens of the divine favor towards him.

   By the enlargement of his steps, he intimates that God had opened up to
   him an even and an accommodating pathway through places to which there
   was before no means of access; for there is in the words an implied
   contrast between a large and spacious place and a narrow spot, out of
   which a person cannot move his foot. The meaning is, that when David
   was reduced to the greatest distress, and saw no way of escape, God had
   graciously brought him out of his straits and difficulties. This is a
   lesson which may be highly useful for correcting our distrust. Unless
   we see before us a beautiful and pleasant plain, in which the flesh may
   freely enjoy itself, we tremble as if the earth would sink under our
   feet. Let us, therefore, remember, that the office of enlarging our
   ways and making them level belongs to God, and is here justly ascribed
   to him. In short, the Psalmist subjoins the effect of this instance of
   the grace of God towards him, namely, that his feet had not staggered
   or slipped; in other words, no resistance, adversity, or calamity,
   which had befallen him, had been able to deprive him of courage or cast
   him into despair.

   [428] "It should be brass, and not steel. A bow of steel," says Dr Adam
   Clarke, "is out of the question. In the days of David, it is not likely
   that the method of making steel was known. The method of making brass
   out of copper was known at a very early period of the world; and the
   ancients had the art of hardening it, so as to work it into the most
   efficient swords." Horsley reads, "Thou hast made my arms like a brazen
   bow." This is also the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Jerome, and
   all the versions. But the reading of Calvin, which is that of our
   English version, seems preferable, and is more expressive. To bend a
   strong bow was anciently considered a proof of great strength, much
   more to compress it so as to break it. To bend a bow of brass is still
   more expressive, and still more so to do it by the arms without
   requiring the assistance of the foot, which was then usually employed
   in making that effort.

   Psalm 18:37-40

   37. I will pursue my enemies, and will overtake them; nor will I return
   till I have consumed them. 38. I have afflicted [or smitten] them, so
   that they were not able to rise; they have fallen under my feet. 39.
   Thou hast girded me with strength [429] for the war; thou hast bowed
   down my enemies under me. 40. And thou hast given me the neck of my
   enemies, and those who hated me I have destroyed. [430]


   The point on which David insists so much is, that of showing from the
   effect or issue, that all his victories were to be traced to the favor
   of God; and from this it follows that his cause was good and just. God,
   no doubt, sometimes grants successes even to the ungodly and wicked;
   but he at length shows by the issue, that he was all the while opposed
   to them and their enemy. It is his servants alone who experience such
   tokens of his favor as he shewed towards David, and he intends by these
   to testify that they are approved and accepted by him. We are apt to
   think that David here speaks too much after the manner of a soldier, in
   declaring that he will not cease from the work of slaughter until he
   has destroyed all his enemies; or rather that he has forgotten the
   gentleness and meekness which ought to shine in all true believers, and
   in which they should resemble their heavenly Father; but as he
   attempted nothing without the command of God, and as his affections
   were governed and regulated by the Holy Spirit, we may be assured that
   these are not the words of a man who was cruel, and who took pleasure
   in shedding blood, but of a man who faithfully executed the judgment
   which God had committed to him. And, indeed, we know that he was so
   distinguished for gentleness of disposition as to abhor the shedding of
   even a single drop of blood, except in so far as duty and the necessity
   of his office required. We must, therefore, take into consideration
   David's vocation, and also his pure zeal, which was free from all
   perturbation of the flesh. Moreover, it should be particularly attended
   to that the Psalmist here calls those his enemies whose indomitable and
   infatuated obstinacy merited and called forth such vengeance from God.
   As he represented the person of Christ, he inflicted the punishment of
   death only on those who were so inflexible that they could not be
   reduced to order by the exercise of a mild and humane authority; and
   this of itself shows, that there was nothing in which he more delighted
   than to pardon those who repented and reformed themselves. He thus
   resembled Christ, who gently allures all men to repentance, but breaks
   in pieces, with his iron rod, those who obstinately resist him to the
   last. The sum of these verses is, that David, as he fought under the
   authority of God, being chosen king by him, and engaging in no
   undertaking without his warrant, was assisted by him, and rendered
   invincible against the assaults of all his enemies, and enabled even to
   discomfit vast and very powerful armies. Farther, let us remember, that
   under this type there is shadowed forth the invincible character and
   condition of the kingdom of Christ, who, trusting to, and sustained by,
   the power of God, overthrows and destroys his enemies, -- who, in every
   encounter, uniformly comes off victorious, -- and who continues king in
   spite of all the resistance which the world makes to his authority and
   power. And as the victories secured to him involve a security of
   similar victories to us, it follows that there is here promised us an
   impregnable defense against all the efforts of Satan, all the
   machinations of sin, and all the temptations of the flesh. Although,
   therefore, Christ can only obtain a tranquil kingdom by fighting, let
   us not on that account be troubled, but let it be enough to satisfy us,
   that the hand of God is always ready to be stretched forth for its
   preservation. David was, for a time, a fugitive, so that it was with
   difficulty he could save his life, by taking shelter in the dens of
   wild beasts; but God, at length, made his enemies turn their backs, and
   not only put them to flight, but also delivered them over to him, that
   he might pursue and utterly discomfit them. In like manner, our enemies
   for a time may be, as it were, just ready to put the knife to our
   throat [431] to destroy us, but God, at length, will make them not only
   to flee before us, but also to perish in our presence, as they deserve.
   At the same time, let us remember what kind of warfare it is to which
   God is calling us, against what kind of persons he will have us to
   contend, and with what armor he furnishes us, that it may suffice us to
   have the devil, the flesh, and sin overthrown and placed under our feet
   by his spiritual power. With respect to those to whom he has given the
   power of the sword, he will also defend them, and not suffer them to be
   unrighteously opposed, provided they reign under Christ, and
   acknowledge him as their head. As to the words, interpreters almost
   unanimously render the beginning of the 40th verse, My enemies have
   turned the back, a phrase of the same import as, They have been put to
   flight; but as the Hebrew word rph, oreph, properly signifies the head
   or neck, we may very suitably view the words as meaning that God gave
   David the neck of his enemies, inasmuch as he delivered them into his
   hands to be slain.

   Psalm 18:41-45

   41. They shall cry, but there shall be no savior for them; even unto
   Jehovah, but he shall not answer them. 42. And I will beat [or grind]
   them small as the dust which is driven by the wind; [432] as the mire
   of the streets I will tread them under foot. 43. Thou shalt deliver me
   from the contentions of the people; thou shalt make me the head of the
   nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me. 44. At the
   hearing of the ear, [433] they shall obey me; the children of strangers
   [434] shall lie to me. [435] 45. The children of strangers shall lose
   their courage, and tremble out of their places of concealment.


   41. They shall cry, etc. The change of the tense in the verb from the
   past to the future does not break the continuity of the narration; and,
   therefore, the words should be explained thus: Although they cried to
   God, yet their prayers were rejected by him. He pursues the same
   subject which it was his object to illustrate before, namely, that it
   was at length manifest from the issue that his enemies falsely boasted
   of having the support and countenance of God, who showed that he had
   turned away from them. It is true, that when their affairs continued to
   go on prosperously, they sometimes received such applause and
   commendation, that it was commonly believed that God was favorable to
   them, while, at the same time he seemed to be opposed to David, who
   although he cried night and day to him, found it of no avail. But after
   God had sufficiently tried the patience of his servant, he cast them
   down, and disappointed them of their vain hope; yea, rather he would
   not deign to hear their prayers. We now perceive the design of David in
   these words. As the ungodly had long wickedly abused the name of God,
   by pretending that he favored their unjust proceedings, the Psalmist
   derides their vain boasting, in which they were completely
   disappointed. It is to be observed, that he here speaks of hypocrites,
   who never call upon God in sincerity and truth. For this promise shall
   never fail,

   "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call
   upon him in truth," (Psalm 145:18.)

   David does not, therefore, say that his enemies were repulsed when they
   had recourse to God with sincere affection of heart, but only when,
   with their accustomed effrontery, they thought that God was, so to
   speak, bound to conduct and advance their wicked enterprises. When the
   ungodly, in the extremity of their distress, pour forth prayers, and
   when, cast down with fear, and trembling with the dread of impending
   evils, they show an appearance of humility, they, notwithstanding, do
   not change their purpose so as truly to repent and amend the evil of
   their ways. Besides, instead of being influenced by faith, they are
   actuated by presumption and hardness of heart, or they pour forth their
   complaints in doubt, rather for the purpose of murmuring against God,
   than of familiarly and confidently placing their trust in him. from
   this passage we may gather a profitable warning, namely, that all who
   treat the afflicted poor with cruel mockery, and who proudly thrust
   back those who come to them as humble suppliants, will experience that
   God is deaf to their prayers. We are farther taught by the following
   verse, that after God has cast off the ungodly, he leaves them to be
   treated with every kind of indignity, and gives them up to be trampled
   under foot, as the mire of the streets. He not only declares, that when
   the proud and the cruel cry to him in their affliction, he will shut
   his ears against their cry; but he also threatens, that, in the course
   of his retributive providence, they shall be treated in the same manner
   in which they treat others.

   43. Thou shalt deliver me from the contentions of the people. David
   states, in a few words, that he had experienced the assistance of God
   in all variety of ways. He was in great danger from the tumults which
   sometimes arose among his own subjects, if God had not wonderfully
   allayed them, and subdued the fierceness of the people. It also
   happened, contrary to the general expectation, that David, as is stated
   in the second clause of the verse, was victorious far and wide, and
   overthrew the neighboring nations who had a little before discomfited
   all Israel by their forces. It was an astonishing renovation of things,
   when he not only suddenly restored to their former estate the people of
   Israel, who had been greatly reduced by defeat and slaughter, but also
   made his tributaries the neighboring nations, with whom before, on
   account of their hostility to the nation of Israel, it was impossible
   to live in peace. It would have been much to see the kingdom, after
   having sustained so grievous a calamity, still surviving, and after
   having again collected strength recovering its former state; but God,
   contrary to all expectation, conferred upon the people of Israel more
   than this; he enabled them even to subdue those who before had been
   their conquerors. David makes mention of both these; he tells us, in
   the first place, that when the people rose up in tumult against him, it
   was none other but God who stilled these commotions which took place
   within the kingdom; and, in the second place, that it was under the
   authority, and by the conduct and power of God, that powerful nations
   were subjected to him, and that the limits of the kingdom, which, in
   the time of Saul, had been weak and half broken, were greatly enlarged.
   Hence it is evident that David was assisted by God, not less with
   respect to his domestic affairs, that is to say, within his own
   kingdom, than against foreign enemies. As the kingdom of David was a
   type under which the Holy Spirit intended to shadow forth to us the
   kingdom of Christ, let us remember that, both in erecting and
   preserving it, it is necessary for God not only to stretch forth his
   arm and fight against avowed enemies, who from without rise up against
   him, but also to repress the tumults and strifes which may take place
   within the Church. This was clearly shown in the person of Christ from
   the beginning. In the first place, he met with much opposition from the
   infatuated obstinacy of those of his own nation. In the next place, the
   experience of all ages shows that the dissensions and strifes with
   which hypocrites rend and mangle the Church, are not less hurtful in
   undermining the kingdom of Christ, (if God do not interpose his hand to
   prevent their injurious effects,) than the violent efforts of his
   enemies. Accordingly God, to advance and maintain the kingdom of his
   own Son, not only overthrows before him external enemies, but also
   delivers him from domestic contentions; that is to say, from those
   within his kingdom, which is the Church. [436] In the song in 2nd
   Samuel, instead of these words, Thou hast made me the head of the
   nations, the word employed is tsmrny, tishmereni, which signifies to
   keep or guard, and is therefore to be understood in this sense, that
   David will be securely, and for a long time, maintained in possession
   of the kingdom. He knew how difficult it is to keep under discipline
   and subjection those who have not been accustomed to the yoke; and,
   accordingly, nothing is of more frequent occurrence than for kingdoms
   which have been lately acquired by conquest to be shaken with fresh
   commotions. But David, in the song in Samuel, declares that God, having
   elevated him to such a high degree of power as to make him the head of
   the nations, will also maintain him in the possession of the
   sovereignty he had been pleased to confer upon him.

   A people whom I have not known shall serve me. The whole of this
   passage strongly confirms what I have just now touched upon, that the
   statements here made are not to be restricted to the person of David,
   but contain a prophecy respecting the kingdom of Christ which was to
   come. David, it is true, might have boasted that nations, with whose
   manners and dispositions he was only very imperfectly acquainted, were
   subject to him; but it is nevertheless certain, that none of the
   nations which he conquered were altogether unknown to him, nor removed
   at so great a distance as to render it difficult for him to acquire
   some knowledge of them. The conquests of David, therefore, and the
   submission of the people to him, were only an obscure figure in which
   God has exhibited to us some faint representation of the boundless
   dominion of his own Son, whose kingdom extends

   "from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same,"
   (Malachi 1:11,)

   and comprehends the whole world.

   44. At the simple fame of my name they shall obey me. This is of the
   same import with the last clause of the preceding verse. Although
   David, by his victories, had acquired such reputation and renown, that
   many laid down their arms and came voluntarily to surrender themselves
   to him; yet, as they also had been subdued through the dread of the
   power of his arms, which they saw their neighbors had experienced to
   their smart, it cannot be said, properly speaking, that at the simple
   fame of the name of David they submitted themselves to him. This
   applies more truly to the person of Christ, who, by means of his word,
   subdues the world to himself, and, at the simple hearing of his name,
   makes those obedient to him who before had been rebels against him. As
   David was intended to be a type of Christ, God subjected to his
   authority distant nations, and such as before had been unknown to
   Israel in so far as familiar intercourse was concerned. But that was
   only a prelude, and, as it were, preparatory to the dominion promised
   to Christ, the boundaries of which must be extended to the uttermost
   ends of the earth. In like manner, David had acquired to himself so
   great a name by arms and warlike prowess, that many of his enemies,
   subdued by fear, submitted themselves to him. And in this God exhibited
   a type of the conquest which Christ would make of the Gentiles, who, by
   the preaching of the Gospel alone, were subdued, and brought
   voluntarily to submit to his dominion; for the obedience of faith in
   which the dominion of Christ is founded "cometh by hearing," (Romans
   10:17.)

   The children of strangers shall lie to me. Here there is described what
   commonly happens in new dominions acquired by conquest, namely, that
   those who have been vanquished pay homage with great reverence to their
   conqueror; but it is by a reigned and forced humility. They obey in a
   slavish manner, and not willingly or cheerfully. This is evidently the
   sense. Some interpreters, indeed, give a different explanation of the
   word lie, viewing David as meaning by it that his enemies had either
   been disappointed in their expectation, or that, in order to escape the
   punishment which they were afraid he might inflict upon them, they had
   lied in declaring that they had never devised any thing hostile against
   him; but it appears to me, that this does not sufficiently express what
   David intended. In my opinion, therefore, the words to lie are here to
   be understood generally as in other places, for to be humbled after a
   slavish manner. The Hebrew word khs, cachash, here used, which
   signifies to lie, is sometimes to be understood metaphorically for to
   be humbled, to submit to, to take upon one's self the yoke of
   subjection; [437] but still in a feigned and servile manner. Those whom
   he terms the children of the stranger, or of strangers, are the nations
   who did not belong to the people of Israel, but who, previous to their
   being conquered by him, formed a distinct and an independent community
   by themselves. This also we see fulfilled in Christ, to whom many come
   with apparent humility; not, however, with true affection, but with a
   double and false heart, whom, on that account, the Holy Spirit fitly
   terms strangers. They are, indeed, mingled among the chosen people, but
   they are not united to the same body with them by a true faith, and,
   therefore, ought not to be accounted children of the Church. It is very
   true that all the Gentiles, when in the beginning they were called into
   the Church, were strangers; but when they began to entertain new
   feelings and new affections towards Christ, they who before were
   "strangers and foreigners" became

   "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,"
   (Ephesians 2:19.)

   What is added immediately after, (verse 45,) the children of strangers
   shall fade away; they shall tremble [438] from within their places of
   concealment, serves to place, in a still more striking light, the great
   fame and formidable name which we have said David had acquired. It is
   no ordinary sign of reverence when those who are protected in
   hiding-places, and shut up within steep fortifications, are so stricken
   with terror as to come forth of their own accord and surrender
   themselves. As fear made the enemies of David to come forth from their
   places of concealment, to meet him with submission, so the Gospel
   strikes the unbelieving with such fear, as compels them to yield
   obedience to Christ. Such is the power of prophecy, that is to say, the
   preaching of the word, as Paul testifies in 1 Corinthians 14:24, that,
   convincing the consciences of men, and making manifest the secrets of
   their hearts, it causes those who before were rebels to prostrate
   themselves with fear, and to give glory to God.

   Psalm 18:46-50

   46. Let Jehovah live, [439] and blessed be my strength: [440] and let
   the God of my salvation be exalted; 47. The God who giveth me
   vengeance, and subdueth peoples [or nations] under me. 48. My deliverer
   from my enemies; yea, thou hast lifted me up from those who had risen
   up against me; thou hast delivered me from the man of violence. 49.
   Therefore will I praise thee, O Jehovah, among the heathen, and will
   sing to thy name. 50. He worketh great deliverances for his king, and
   showeth mercy to David, his anointed, and to his seed for ever.


   46. Let Jehovah live. If it is thought proper to adopt this reading,
   which is in the optative mood expressing a wish that God might live,
   the manner of expression may seem somewhat strange; but it may be
   alleged in defense of it, that it is a metaphor borrowed from the
   custom of men, who not only use this manner of speaking when they wish
   well to any one, but likewise utter it with loud and applauding
   acclamation, when they intend to receive their princes with due honor.
   According to this view, it would be an expression in which praise is
   ascribed to God, and suitable for a triumphal song. [441] It may,
   however, be very properly considered as a simple affirmation, in which
   David declares that God lives, in other words, that he is endued with
   sovereign power. Farther, the life which David attributes to God is not
   to be restricted to the being or essence of God, but is rather to be
   understood of the evidence of it deducible from his works, which
   manifest to us that he liveth. Whenever he withdraws the working of his
   power from before our eyes, the sense and cognisance of the truth, "God
   liveth," also evanishes from our minds. He is, therefore, said to live,
   inasmuch as he shows, by evident proofs of his power, that it is he who
   preserves and upholds the world. And as David had known, by experience,
   this life of God, he celebrates it with praises and thanksgiving. If we
   read the first clause in the present tense, The Lord liveth, the copula
   and, which follows, has the force of an inference; and, accordingly,
   the words should be resolved thus:-- Jehovah liveth, and, therefore,
   blessed be my strength The epithet, My strength, and the other which
   occurs in verse 48th, My deliverer, confirm what I have already stated,
   that God does not simply live in himself, and in his secret place, but
   displays his vital energy in the government of the whole world. The
   Hebrew word, tsvry, tsuri, which we have translated my strength, is
   here to be understood in a transitive sense for Him who bestows
   strength.

   47. The God who giveth me vengeance. The Psalmist again attributes to
   God the victories which he had obtained. As he could never have
   expected to obtain them unless he had been confident that he would
   receive the aid of God, so now he acknowledges God to be the sole
   author of them. That he may not seem carelessly to bestow upon him, as
   it were, in passing, only a small sprinkling of the praise of his
   victories, he repeats, in express terms, that he had nothing but what
   God had given him. In the first place, he acknowledges that power was
   given him from above, to enable him to inflict on his enemies the
   punishment which they deserved. It may seem at first sight strange that
   God should arm his own people to execute vengeance; but as I have
   previously shown you, we ought always to remember David's vocation. He
   was not a private person, but being endued with royal power and
   authority, the judgment which he executed was enjoined upon him by God.
   If a man, upon receiving injury, breaks forth to avenge himself, he
   usurps the office of God; and, therefore, it is rash and impious for
   private individuals to retaliate the injuries which have been inflicted
   upon them. With respect to kings and magistrates, God, who declares
   that vengeance belongeth to him, in arming them with the sword,
   constitutes them the ministers and executioners of his vengeance.
   David, therefore, has put the word vengeance for the just punishments
   which it was lawful for him to inflict by the commandment of God,
   provided he was led under the influence of a zeal duly regulated by the
   Holy Spirit, and not under the influence of the impetuosity of the
   flesh. Unless this moderation is exemplified in performing the duties
   of their calling, it is in vain for kings to boast that God has
   committed to them the charge of taking vengeance; seeing it is not less
   unwarrantable for a man to abuse, according to his own fancy and the
   lust of the flesh, the sword which he is allowed to use, than to seize
   it without the command of God. The Church militant, which is under the
   standard of Christ, has no permission to execute vengeance, except
   against those who obstinately refuse to be reclaimed. We are commanded
   to endeavor to overcome our enemies by doing them good, and to pray for
   their salvation. It becomes us, therefore, at the same time, to desire
   that they may be brought to repentance, and to a right state of mind,
   until it appear beyond all doubt that they are irrecoverably and
   hopelessly depraved. In the meantime, in regard to vengeance, it must
   be left to God, that we may not be carried headlong to execute it
   before the time. David next concludes, from the perils and distresses
   in which he had been involved, that if he had not been preserved by the
   hand of God, he could not in any other way have escaped in safety: My
   deliverer from my enemies; yea, thou hast lifted me up from those who
   had risen up against me. The sense in which we are to understand the
   lifting up of which he speaks is, that he was wonderfully raised up
   above the power and malice of his enemies that he might not sink under
   their violence, and that they might not be victorious over him.

   49. Therefore will I praise thee, O Jehovah! In this verse he teaches
   us that the blessings God had conferred upon him, of which he had
   spoken, are worthy of being celebrated with extraordinary and unusual
   praises, that the fame of them might reach even the heathen. There is
   in the words an implied contrast between the ordinary worship of God
   which the faithful were then accustomed to perform in the temple, and
   this thanksgiving of which David speaks, which could not be confined
   within so narrow limits. The meaning, therefore, is, O Lord, I will not
   only give thee thanks in the assembly of thy people, according to the
   ritual which thou hast appointed in thy law, but thy praises shall
   extend to a greater distance, even as thy grace towards me is worthy of
   being recounted through the whole world. Moreover, from these words we
   conclude that this passage contains a prophecy concerning the kingdom
   of Christ, which was to come. Unless the heathen had been allured into
   the fellowship of the chosen people, and united into one body with
   them, to praise God among them would have been to sing his praises
   among the deaf, which would have been foolish work and lost labor.
   Accordingly, Paul very properly and suitably proves from this text,
   that the calling of the Gentiles was not a thing which happened by
   chance, or at a venture, (Romans 15:9.) We shall afterwards see in many
   places that the Church is appointed to be the sacred dwelling-place for
   showing forth the praises of God. And, therefore, the name of God could
   not have been rightly and profitably celebrated elsewhere than in
   Judea, until the ears of the Gentiles were opened, which was done when
   God adopted them, and called them to himself by the gospel.

   50. He worketh great deliverances, etc This concluding verse clearly
   shows why God had exercised such goodness and liberality towards David,
   namely, because he had anointed him to be king. By calling himself
   God's king, David testifies that he had not rashly rushed into that
   office, nor was thrust into it by conspiracies and wicked intrigues,
   but, on the contrary, reigned by lawful right, inasmuch as it was the
   will of God that he should be king. This he proves by the ceremony of
   anointing; for God, in anointing him by the hand of Samuel, had
   asserted his right to reign not less than if he had visibly stretched
   forth his hand from heaven to place and establish him on the royal
   throne. This election, he says, was confirmed by a continued series of
   great deliverances; and from this it follows, that all who enter on any
   course without having the call of God, are chargeable with avowedly
   making war against him. At the same time, he attributes these
   deliverances to the goodness of God as their cause, to teach us, that
   that kingdom was founded purely and simply upon the good pleasure of
   God. Farther, from the concluding sentence of the psalm, it appears, as
   I have said before, that David does not here so much recount by way of
   history the singular and varied instances of the grace of God which he
   had personally experienced, as predict the everlasting duration of his
   kingdom. And it is to be observed, that by the word seed we are not to
   understand all his descendants indiscriminately; but we are to consider
   it as particularly referring to that successor of David of whom God had
   spoken in 2 Samuel 7:12, promising that he would be a father to him. As
   it had been predicted that his kingdom would continue as long as the
   sun and the moon should shine in the heavens, the prophecy must
   necessarily be viewed as descending to him who was to be king not for a
   time, but for ever. David, therefore, commends his seed to us, as
   honored by that remarkable promise, which fully applies neither to
   Solomon nor to any other of his successors, but to the only begotten
   Son of God; as the apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, (Hebrews
   1:4,) teaches us, that this is a dignity in which he excels the angels.
   In conclusion, we shall then only duly profit in the study of this
   psalm, when we are led by the contemplation of the shadow and type to
   him who is the substance.

   PSALM 19

   To the chief musician. A song of David.

   David, with the view of encouraging the faithful to contemplate the
   glory of God, sets before them in the first place, a mirror of it in
   the fabric of the heavens, and in the exquisite order of their
   workmanship which we behold; and in the second place, he recalls our
   thoughts to the Law, in which God made himself more familiarly known to
   his chosen people. Taking occasion from this, he continues to discourse
   at considerable length on this peculiar gift of Heaven, commending and
   exalting the use of the law. Finally, he concludes the psalm with a
   prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 19:1-6

   1. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse [442]
   proclaims the works of his hands. 2. Day unto day uttereth speech, and
   night unto night publishes knowledge. [443] 3. There is no language and
   no speech [where] their voice is not heard. 4. Their writing has gone
   forth through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world:
   he hath set in them a tabernacle for the sun. 5. And he goeth forth as
   a bridegroom out of his chamber: he rejoiceth as a strong man to run
   his race. 6. His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his
   circuit is to their utmost limits, and none is hidden from his heat.


   1. The heavens declare the glory of God. [444] I have already said,
   that this psalm consists of two parts, in the first of which David
   celebrates the glory of God as manifested in his works; and, in the
   other, exalts and magnifies the knowledge of God which shines forth
   more clearly in his word. He only makes mention of the heavens; but,
   under this part of creation, which is the noblest, and the excellency
   of which is more conspicuous, he doubtless includes by synecdoche the
   whole fabric of the world. There is certainly nothing so obscure or
   contemptible, even in the smallest corners of the earth, in which some
   marks of the power and wisdom of God may not be seen; but as a more
   distinct image of him is engraven on the heavens, David has
   particularly selected them for contemplation, that their splendor might
   lead us to contemplate all parts of the world. When a man, from
   beholding and contemplating the heavens, has been brought to
   acknowledge God, he will learn also to reflect upon and to admire his
   wisdom and power as displayed on the face of the earth, not only in
   general, but even in the minutest plants. In the first verse, the
   Psalmist repeats one thing twice, according to his usual manner. He
   introduces the heavens as witnesses and preachers of the glory of God,
   attributing to the dumb creature a quality which, strictly speaking,
   does not belong to it, in order the more severely to upbraid men for
   their ingratitude, if they should pass over so clear a testimony with
   unheeding ears. This manner of speaking more powerfully moves and
   affects us than if he had said, The heavens show or manifest the glory
   of God. It is indeed a great thing, that in the splendor of the heavens
   there is presented to our view a lively image of God; but, as the
   living voice has a greater effect in exciting our attention, or at
   least teaches us more surely and with greater profit than simple
   beholding, to which no oral instruction is added, we ought to mark the
   force of the figure which the Psalmist uses when he says, that the
   heavens by their preaching declare the glory of God.

   The repetition which he makes in the second clause is merely an
   explanation of the first. David shows how it is that the heavens
   proclaim to us the glory of God, namely, by openly bearing testimony
   that they have not been put together by chance, but were wonderfully
   created by the supreme Architect. When we behold the heavens, we cannot
   but be elevated, by the contemplation of them, to Him who is their
   great Creator; and the beautiful arrangement and wonderful variety
   which distinguish the courses and station of the heavenly bodies,
   together with the beauty and splendor which are manifest in them,
   cannot but furnish us with an evident proof of his providence.
   Scripture, indeed, makes known to us the time and manner of the
   creation; but the heavens themselves, although God should say nothing
   on the subject, proclaim loudly and distinctly enough that they have
   been fashioned by his hands: and this of itself abundantly suffices to
   bear testimony to men of his glory. As soon as we acknowledge God to be
   the supreme Architect, who has erected the beauteous fabric of the
   universe, our minds must necessarily be ravished with wonder at his
   infinite goodness, wisdom, and power.

   2. Day unto day uttereth speech. Philosophers, who have more
   penetration into those matters than others, understand how the stars
   are arranged in such beautiful order, that notwithstanding their
   immense number there is no confusion; but to the ignorant and
   unlettered, the continual succession of days is a more undoubted proof
   of the providence of God. David, therefore, having spoken of the
   heavens, does not here descend from them to other parts of the world;
   but, from an effect more sensible and nearer our apprehension, he
   confirms what he has just now said, namely, that the glory of God not
   only shines, but also resounds in the heavens. The words may be
   variously expounded, but the different expositions which have been
   given of them make little difference as to the sense. Some explain them
   thus, that no day passes in which God does not show some signal
   evidence of his power. Others are of opinion that they denote the
   augmentations of instruction and knowledge, - that every succeeding day
   contributes something new in proof of the existence and perfections of
   God. Others view them as meaning that the days and nights talk
   together, and reason concerning the glory of their Creator', but this
   is a somewhat forced interpretation. David, I have no doubt, here
   teaches, from the established alternations of days and nights, that the
   course and revolutions of the sun, and moon, and stars, are regulated
   by the marvellous wisdom of God. Whether we translate the words Day
   after day, or one day to another day, is of little consequence; for all
   that David means is the beautiful arrangement of time which the
   succession of days and nights effects. If, indeed, we were as attentive
   as we ought to be, even one day would suffice to bear testimony to us
   of the glory of God, and even one night would be sufficient to perform
   to us the same office. But when we see the sun and the moon performing
   their daily revolutions, -- the sun by day appearing over our heads,
   and the moon succeeding in its turns -- the sun ascending by degrees,
   while at the same time he approaches nearer us, -- and afterwards
   bending his course so as to depart from us by little and little; -- and
   when we see that by this means the length of the days and nights is
   regulated, and that the variation of their length is arranged according
   to a law so uniform, as invariably to recur at the same points of time
   in every successive year, we have in this a much brighter testimony to
   the glory of God. David, therefore, with the highest reason, declares,
   that although God should not speak a single word to men, yet the
   orderly and useful succession of days and nights eloquently proclaims
   the glory of God, and that there is now left to men no pretext for
   ignorance; for since the days and nights perform towards us so well and
   so carefully the office of teachers, we may acquire, if we are duly
   attentive, a sufficient amount of knowledge under their tuition.

   3. There is no language nor speech [where] their voice is not heard.
   This verse receives two almost contrary interpretations, each of which,
   however, has the appearance of probability. As the words, when rendered
   literally, read thus -- No language, and no words, their voice is not
   heard -- some connect the third and fourth verses together, as if this
   sentence were incomplete without the clause which follows in the
   beginning of the fourth verse, Their writing has gone forth through all
   the earth, etc. According to them, the meaning is this:-- The heavens,
   it is true, are mute and are not endued with the faculty of speech; but
   still they proclaim the glory of God with a voice sufficiently loud and
   distinct. But if this was David's meaning, what need was there to
   repeat three times that they have not articulate speech? It would
   certainly be spiritless and superfluous to insist so much upon a thing
   so universally known. The other exposition, therefore, as it is more
   generally received, seems also to be more suitable. In the Hebrew
   tongue, which is concise, it is often necessary to supply some word;
   and it is particularly a common thing in that language for the
   relatives to be omitted, that is to say, the words which, in which,
   etc., as here, There is no language, there is no speech, [where [445] ]
   their voice is not heard. [446] Besides, the third negation, vly, beli,
   [447] rather denotes an exception to what is stated in the preceding
   members of the sentence, as if it had been said, The difference and
   variety of languages does not prevent the preaching of the heavens and
   their language from being heard and understood in every quarter of the
   world. The difference of languages is a barrier which prevents
   different nations from maintaining mutual intercourse, and it makes him
   who in his own country is distinguished for his eloquence, when he
   comes into a foreign country either dumb or, if he attempt to speak,
   barbarous. And even although a man could speak all languages, he could
   not speak to a Grecian and a Roman at the same time; for as soon as he
   began to direct his discourse to the one, the other would cease to
   understand him. David, therefore, by making a tacit comparison,
   enhances the efficacy of the testimony which the heavens bear to their
   Creator. The import of his language is, Different nations differ from
   each other as to language; but the heavens have a common language to
   teach all men without distinction, nor is there any thing but their own
   carelessness to hinder even those who are most strange to each other,
   and who live in the most distant parts of the world, from profiting, as
   it were, at the mouth of the same teacher.

   4. Their writing has gone forth, etc. Here the inspired writer declares
   how the heavens preach to all nations indiscriminately, namely, because
   men, in all countries and in all parts of the earth, may understand
   that the heavens are set before their eyes as witnesses to bear
   testimony to the glory of God. As the Hebrew word qv, kav signifies
   sometimes a line, and sometimes a building, some deduce from it this
   meaning, that the fabric of the heavens being framed in a regular
   manner, and as it were by line, proclaims the glory of God in all parts
   of the world. But as David here metaphorically introduces the splendor
   and magnificence of the heavenly bodies, as preaching the glory of God
   like a teacher in a seminary of learning, it would be a meagre and
   unsuitable manner of speaking to say, that the line of the heavens goes
   forth to the uttermost ends of the earth. Besides, he immediately adds,
   in the following clause, that their words are every where heard; but
   what relation is there between words and the beauty of a building? If,
   however, we render qv, kav, writing, these two things will very well
   agree, first, that the glory of God is written and imprinted in the
   heavens, as in an open volume which all men may read; and, secondly,
   that, at the same time, they give forth a loud and distinct voice,
   which reaches the ears of all men, and causes itself to be heard in all
   places. [448] Thus we are taught, that the language of which mention
   has been made before is, as I may term it, a visible language, in other
   words, language which addresses itself to the sight; for it is to the
   eyes of men that the heavens speak, not to their ears; and thus David
   justly compares the beautiful order and arrangement, by which the
   heavenly bodies are distinguished, to a writing. That the Hebrew word
   qv, kav, signifies a line in writing, [449] is sufficiently evident
   from Isaiah 28:10, where God, comparing the Jews to children who are
   not yet of sufficient age to make great proficiency, speaks thus:

   "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon
   line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."

   In my judgment, therefore, the meaning is, that the glory of God is not
   written in small obscure letters, but richly engraven in large and
   bright characters, which all men may read, and read with the greatest
   ease. Hitherto I have explained the true and proper meaning of the
   inspired writer. Some have wrested this part of the psalm by putting
   upon it an allegorical interpretation; but my readers will easily
   perceive that this has been done without reason. I have shown in the
   commencement, and it is also evident from the scope of the whole
   discourse, that David, before coming to the law, sets before us the
   fabric of the world, that in it we might behold the glory of God. Now,
   if we understand the heavens as meaning the apostles, and the sun
   Christ, there will be no longer place for the division of which we have
   spoken; and, besides, it would be an improper arrangement to place the
   gospel first and then the law. It is very evident that the inspired
   poet here treats of the knowledge of God, which is naturally presented
   to all men in this world as in a mirror; and, therefore, I forbear
   discoursing longer on that point. As, however, these allegorical
   interpreters have supported their views from the words of Paul, this
   difficulty must be removed. Paul, in discoursing upon the calling of
   the Gentiles, lays down this as an established principle, that,
   "Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved;" and
   then he adds, that it is impossible for any to call upon him until they
   know him by the teaching of the gospel. But as it seemed to the Jews to
   be a kind of sacrilege that Paul published the promise of salvation to
   the Gentiles, he asks whether the Gentiles themselves had not heard?
   And he answers, by quoting this passage, that there was a school open
   and accessible to them, in which they might learn to fear God, and
   serve him, inasmuch as "the writing [450] of the heavens has gone forth
   through all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world,"
   (Romans 10:18.) But Paul could not at that time have said with truth,
   that the voice of the gospel had been heard through the whole world
   from the mouth of the apostles, since it had scarcely as yet reached
   even a few countries. The preaching of the other apostles certainly had
   not then extended to far distant parts of the world, but was confined
   within the boundaries of Judea. The design of the apostle it is not
   difficult to comprehend. He intended to say that God, from ancient
   times, had manifested his glory to the Gentiles, and that this was a
   prelude to the more ample instruction which was one day to be published
   to them. And although God's chosen people for a time had been in a
   condition distinct and separate from that of the Gentiles, it ought not
   to be thought strange that God at length made himself known
   indiscriminately to both, seeing he had hitherto united them to himself
   by certain means which addressed themselves in common to both; as Paul
   says in another passage, that when God,

   "in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, he
   nevertheless left not himself without a witness,"
   (Acts 14:16, 17.)

   Whence we conclude, that those who have imagined that Paul departed
   from the genuine and proper sense of David's words are grossly
   mistaken. The reader will understand this still more clearly by reading
   my commentaries on the above passage of St. Paul.

   He hath set in them a tabernacle [or pavilion] for the sun. As David,
   out of the whole fabric of the world, has especially chosen the
   heavens, in which he might exhibit to our view an image of God, because
   there it is more distinctly to be seen, even as a man is better seen
   when set on an elevated stage; so now he shows us the sun as placed in
   the highest rank, because in his wonderful brightness the majesty of
   God displays itself more magnificently than in all the rest. The other
   planets, it is true, have also their motions, and as it were the
   appointed places within which they run their race, [451] and the
   firmament, by its own revolution, draws with it all the fixed stars,
   but it would have been lost time for David to have attempted to teach
   the secrets of astronomy to the rude and unlearned; and therefore he
   reckoned it sufficient to speak in a homely style, that he might
   reprove the whole world of ingratitude, if, in beholding the sun, they
   are not taught the fear and the knowledge of God. This, then, is the
   reason why he says that a tent or pavilion has been erected for the
   sun, and also why he says, that he goes forth from one end of the
   heaven, and quickly passes to the other and opposite end. He does not
   here discourse scientifically (as he might have done, had he spoken
   among philosophers) concerning the entire revolution which the sun
   performs, but, accommodating himself to the rudest and dullest, he
   confines himself to the ordinary appearances presented to the eye, and,
   for this reason, he does not speak of the other half of the sun's
   course, which does not appear in our hemisphere. He proposes to us
   three things to be considered in the sun, -- the splendor and
   excellency of his forms -- the swiftness with which he runs his course,
   -- and the astonishing power of his heat. The more forcibly to express
   and magnify his surpassing beauty and, as it were, magnificent attire,
   he employs the similitude of a bridegroom. He then adds another
   similitude, that of a valiant man who enters the lists as a racer to
   carry off the prize of the course. The swiftness of those who in
   ancient times contended in the stadium, whether on chariots or on foot,
   was wonderful; and although it was nothing when compared with the
   velocity with which the sun moves in his orbit, yet David, among all
   that he saw coming under the ordinary notice of men, could find nothing
   which approached nearer to it. Some think that the third clause, where
   he speaks of the heat of the sun, is to be understood of his vegetative
   heat, as it is called; in other words, that by which the vegetating
   bodies which are in the earth have their vigor, support, and growth.
   [452] But I do not think that this sense suits the passage. It is,
   indeed, a wonderful work of God, and a signal evidence of his goodness,
   that the powerful influence of the sun penetrating the earth renders it
   fruitful. But as the Psalmist says, that no man or nothing is hidden
   from his heat, I am rather inclined to understand it of the violent
   heat which scorches men and other living creatures as well as plants
   and trees. With respect to the enlivening heat of the sun, by which we
   feel ourselves to be invigorated, no man desires to avoid it.

   Grotius renders it here without. As, vl bal, means in Arabic but, and
   as the Arabic is just a dialect of the Hebrew, Hammond concludes that
   this may have been its meaning among the Jews; and therefore proposes
   to render the verse thus:-- "Not speech, nor words, but, or
   notwithstanding, [vly, beli,] their voice is, or has been heard."

   [448] "Et se fait ouir en totals endroits." -- Fr.

   [449] The reading in the English Geneva Bible is, "Their line is gone
   forth through all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
   world." The marginal note in explanation of this is, "The heavens are
   as a line of great capital letters to show unto us God's glory."

   [450] Paul reads, "their sound," quoting from the Septuagint, the
   version of the Old Testament then chiefly used, and it employs here the
   word phthongos.

   Psalm 19:7-9

   7. The law of the Lord [453] is perfect, restoring the soul; the
   testimony of Jehovah is faithful, [or true, [454] ] instructing the
   babes in wisdom. 8. The statutes of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the
   heart; the commandment of the Lord [455] is pure, enlightening the
   eyes. 9. The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments
   of Jehovah are truth, and justified together.


   7. The law of the Lord. Here the second part of the psalm commences.
   After having shown that the creatures, although they do not speak,
   nevertheless serve as instructors to all mankind, and teach all men so
   clearly that there is a God, as to render them inexcusable, the
   Psalmist now turns towards the Jews, to whom God had communicated a
   fuller knowledge of himself by means of his word. While the heavens
   bear witness concerning God, their testimony does not lead men so far
   as that thereby they learn truly to fear him, and acquire a
   well-grounded knowledge of him; it serves only to render them
   inexcusable. It is doubtless true, that if we were not very dull and
   stupid, the signatures and proofs of Deity which are to be found on the
   theater of the world, are abundant enough to incite us to acknowledge
   and reverence God; but as, although surrounded with so clear a light,
   we are nevertheless blind, this splendid representation of the glory of
   God, without the aid of the word, would profit us nothing, although it
   should be to us as a loud and distinct proclamation sounding in our
   ears. Accordingly, God vouchsafes to those whom he has determined to
   call to salvation special grace, just as in ancient times, while he
   gave to all men without exception evidences of his existence in his
   works, he communicated to the children of Abraham alone his Law,
   thereby to furnish them with a more certain and intimate knowledge of
   his majesty. Whence it follows, that the Jews are bound by a double tie
   to serve God. As the Gentiles, to whom God has spoken only by the dumb
   creatures, have no excuse for their ignorance, how much less is their
   stupidity to be endured who neglect to hear the voice which proceeds
   from his own sacred mouth? The end, therefore, which David here has in
   view, is to excite the Jews, whom God had bound to himself by a more
   sacred bond, to yield obedience to him with a more prompt and cheerful
   affection. Farther, under the term law, he not only means the rule of
   living righteously, or the Ten Commandments, but he also comprehends
   the covenant by which God had distinguished that people from the rest
   of the world, and the whole doctrine of Moses, the parts of which he
   afterwards enumerates under the terms testimonies, statutes, and other
   names. These titles and commendations by which he exalts the dignity
   and excellence of the Law would not agree with the Ten Commandments
   alone, unless there were, at the same time, joined to them a free
   adoption and the promises which depend upon it; and, in short, the
   whole body of doctrine of which true religion and godliness consists.
   As to the Hebrew words which are here used, I will not spend much time
   in endeavoring very exactly to give the particular signification of
   each of them, because it is easy to gather from other passages, that
   they are sometimes confounded or used indifferently. dvt, eduth, which
   we render testimony, is generally taken for the covenant, in which God,
   on the one hand, promised to the children of Abraham that he would be
   their God, and on the other required faith and obedience on their part.
   It, therefore, denotes the mutual covenant entered into between God and
   his ancient people. The word phqvdym, pikkudim, which I have followed
   others in translating statutes, is restricted by some to ceremonies,
   but improperly in my judgment: for I find that it is every where taken
   generally for ordinances and edicts. The word mtsvh, mitsvah, which
   follows immediately after, and which we translate commandment, has
   almost the same signification. As to the other words, we shall consider
   them in their respective places.

   The first commendation of the law of God is, that it is perfect. By
   this word David means, that if a man is duly instructed in the law of
   God, he wants nothing which is requisite to perfect wisdom. In the
   writings of heathen authors there are no doubt to be found true and
   useful sentences scattered here and there; and it is also true, that
   God has put into the minds of men some knowledge of justice and
   uprightness; but in consequence of the corruption of our nature, the
   true light of truth is not to be found among men where revelation is
   not enjoyed, but only certain mutilated principles which are involved
   in much obscurity and doubt. David, therefore, justly claims this
   praise for the law of God, that it contains in it perfect and absolute
   wisdom. As the conversion of the soul, of which he speaks immediately
   after, is doubtless to be understood of its restoration, I have felt no
   difficulty in so rendering it. There are some who reason with too much
   subtilty on this expression, by explaining it as referring to the
   repentance and regeneration of man. I admit that the soul cannot be
   restored by the law of God, without being at the same time renewed unto
   righteousness; but we must consider what is David's proper meaning,
   which is this, that as the soul gives vigor and strength to the body,
   so the law in like manner is the life of the soul. In saying that the
   soul is restored, he has an allusion to the miserable state in which we
   are all born. There, no doubt, still survive in us some small remains
   of the first creation; but as no part of our constitution is free from
   defilement and impurity, the condition of the soul thus corrupted and
   depraved differs little from death, and tends altogether to death. It
   is, therefore, necessary that God should employ the law as a remedy for
   restoring us to purity; not that the letter of the law can do this of
   itself, as shall be afterwards shown more at length, but because God
   employs his word as an instrument for restoring our souls.

   When the Psalmist declares, The testimony of Jehovah is faithful, it is
   a repetition of the preceding sentence, so that the integrity or
   perfection of the law and the faithfulness or truth of his testimony,
   signify the same thing; namely, that when we give ourselves up to be
   guided and governed by the word of God, we are in no danger of going
   astray, since this is the path by which he securely guides his own
   people to salvation. Instruction in wisdom seems here to be added as
   the commencement of the restoration of the soul. Understanding is the
   most excellent endowment of the soul; and David teaches us that it is
   to be derived from the law, for we are naturally destitute of it. By
   the word babes, he is not to be understood as meaning any particular
   class of persons, as if others were sufficiently wise of themselves;
   but by it he teaches us, in the first place, that none are endued with
   right understanding until they have made progress in the study of the
   law. In the second place, he shows by it what kind of scholars God
   requires, namely, those who are fools in their own estimation, (1
   Corinthians 3:18,) and who come down to the rank of children, that the
   loftiness of their own understanding may not prevent them from giving
   themselves up, with a spirit of entire docility, to the teaching of the
   word of God.

   8. The statutes of Jehovah are right. The Psalmist at first view may
   seem to utter a mere common-place sentiment when he calls the statutes
   of the Lord right. If we, however, more attentively consider the
   contrast which he no doubt makes between the rectitude of the law and
   the crooked ways in which men entangle themselves when they follow
   their own understandings, we will be convinced that this commendation
   implies more than may at first sight appear. We know how much every man
   is wedded to himself, and how difficult it is to eradicate from our
   minds the vain confidence of our own wisdom. It is therefore of great
   importance to be well convinced of this truth, that a man's life cannot
   be ordered aright unless it is framed according to the law of God, and
   that without this he can only wander in labyrinths and crooked bypaths.
   David adds, in the second place, that God's statutes rejoice the heart.
   This implies that there is no other joy true and solid but that which
   proceeds from a good conscience; and of this we become partakers when
   we are certainly persuaded that our life is pleasing and acceptable to
   God. No doubt, the source from which true peace of conscience proceeds
   is faith, which freely reconciles us to God. But to the saints who
   serve God with true affection of heart there arises unspeakable joy
   also, from the knowledge that they do not labor in his service in vain,
   or without hope of recompense, since they have God as the judge and
   approver of their life. In short, this joy is put in opposition to all
   the corrupt enticements and pleasures of the world, which are a deadly
   bait, luring wretched souls to their everlasting destruction. The
   import of the Psalmist's language is, Those who take delight in
   committing sin procure for themselves abundant matter of sorrow; but
   the observance of the law of God, on the contrary, brings to man true
   joy. In the end of the verse, the Psalmist teaches that the commandment
   of God is pure, enlightening the eyes By this he gives us tacitly to
   understand that it is only in the commandments of God that we find the
   difference between good and evil laid down, and that it is in vain to
   seek it elsewhere, since whatever men devise of themselves is mere
   filth and refuse, corrupting the purity of the life. He farther
   intimates that men, with all their acuteness, are blind, and always
   wander in darkness, until they turn their eyes to the light of heavenly
   doctrine. Whence it follows, that none are truly wise but those who
   take God for their conductor and guide, following the path which he
   points out to them, and who are diligently seeking after the peace
   which he offers and presents by his word.

   But here a question of no small difficulty arises; for Paul seems
   entirely to overthrow these commendations of the law which David here
   recites. How can these things agree together: that the law restores the
   souls of men, while yet it is a dead and deadly letter? that it
   rejoices men's hearts, and yet, by bringing in the spirit of bondage,
   strikes them with terror? that it enlightens the eyes, and yet, by
   casting a veil before our minds, excludes the light which ought to
   penetrate within? But, in the first place, we must remember what I have
   shown you at the commencement, that David does not speak simply of the
   precepts of the Moral Law, but comprehends the whole covenant by which
   God had adopted the descendants of Abraham to be his peculiar people;
   and, therefore, to the Moral Law, the rule of living well -- he joins
   the free promises of salvation, or rather Christ himself, in whom and
   upon whom this adoption was founded. But Paul, who had to deal with
   persons who perverted and abused the law, and separated it from the
   grace and the Spirit of Christ, refers to the ministry of Moses viewed
   merely by itself, and according to the letter. It is certain, that if
   the Spirit of Christ does not quicken the law, the law is not only
   unprofitable, but also deadly to its disciples. Without Christ there is
   in the law nothing but inexorable rigour, which adjudges all mankind to
   the wrath and curse of God. And farther, without Christ, there remains
   within us a rebelliousness of the flesh, which kindles in our hearts a
   hatred of God and of his law, and from this proceed the distressing
   bondage and awful terror of which the Apostle speaks. These different
   ways in which the law may be viewed, easily show us the manner of
   reconciling these passages of Paul and David, which seem at first view
   to be at variance. The design of Paul is to show what the law can do
   for us, taken by itself; that is to say, what it can do for us when,
   without the promise of grace, it strictly and rigorously exacts from us
   the duty which we owe to God; but David, in praising it as he here
   does, speaks of the whole doctrine of the law, which includes also the
   gospel, and, therefore, under the law he comprehends Christ.

   9. The fear of Jehovah is clean. By the fear of God we are here to
   understand the way in which God is to be served; and therefore it is
   taken in an active sense for the doctrine which prescribes to us the
   manner in which we ought to fear God. The way in which men generally
   manifest their fear of God, is by inventing false religions and a
   vitiated worship; in doing which they only so much the more provoke his
   wrath. David, therefore, here indirectly condemns these corrupt
   inventions, about which men torment themselves in vain, [456] and which
   often sanction impurity; and in opposition to them he justly affirms,
   that in the keeping of the law there is an exemption from every thing
   which defiles. He adds, that it endures for ever; as if he had said,
   This is the treasure of everlasting happiness. We see how mankind,
   without well thinking what they are doing, pursue, with impetuous and
   ardent affections, the transitory things of this world; but, in thus
   catching at the empty shadow of a happy life, they lose true happiness
   itself. In the second clause, by calling the commandments of God truth,
   David shows that whatever men undertake to do at the mere suggestion of
   their own minds, without having a regard to the law of God as a rule,
   is error and falsehood. And, indeed, he could not have more effectually
   stirred us up to love, and zealously to live according to the law, than
   by giving us this warning, that all those who order their life, without
   having any respect to the law of God, deceive themselves, and follow
   after mere delusions. Those who explain the word judgments, as
   referring only to the commandments of the second table, are, in my
   opinion, mistaken: for David's purpose was to commend, under a variety
   of expressions, the advantages which the faithful receive from the law
   of God. When he says, They are justified together, the meaning is, They
   are all righteous from the greatest to the least, without a single
   exception. By this commendation he distinguishes the law of God from
   all the doctrines of men, for no blemish or fault can be found in it,
   but it is in all points absolutely perfect.

   Psalm 19:10-11

   10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;
   sweeter also than honey, and the droppings of honeycombs. [457] 11.
   Moreover, by them is thy servant made circumspect; and in the keeping
   of them there is great reward.


   10. More to be desired are they than gold. The Psalmist now exalts the
   law of God both on account of its price and sweetness. This
   commendation depends on the commendations given in the preceding
   verses; for the many and great advantages which he has just now
   enumerated, ought justly to make us account heavenly truth the highest
   and most excellent treasure, and to despise, when compared with it, all
   the gold and silver of the world. Instead of the word fine gold, which
   the Latins have called Aurum obryzum, [458] some render the Hebrew word
   a jewel, or precious stones, [459] but the other translation is more
   generally received, namely, fine gold, that is, gold which is pure and
   well refined in the furnace; and there are many passages of Scripture
   by which this rendering is confirmed. [460] The Hebrew word phz, paz,
   is derived from phzh, pazah, which signifies to strengthen; [461] from
   which we may conjecture that the Psalmist does not mean the gold of any
   particular country, as if one should say the gold of Ophir, but gold
   completely refined and purified by art. So far is phz, paz, from being
   derived from the name of a country, that, on the contrary, it appears
   from Jeremiah 10:9, that the land of Uphaz took its name from this
   Hebrew word, because it had in it mines of the finest gold. As to the
   origin of the word obrizum, which the Latins have used, we cannot say
   any thing with certainty, except that, according to the conjecture of
   Jerome, it signifies brought from the land of Ophir, as if it had been
   said, aurum Ophrizum. In short, the sense is, that we do not esteem the
   law as it deserves, if we do not prefer it to all the riches of the
   world. If we are once brought thus highly to prize the law, it will
   serve effectually to deliver our hearts from an immoderate desire of
   gold and silver. To this esteem of the law there must be added love to
   it, and delight in it, so that it may not only subdue us to obedience
   by constraint, but also allure us by its sweetness; a thing which is
   impossible, unless, at the same time, we have mortified in us the love
   of carnal pleasures, with which it is not wonderful to see us enticed
   and ensnared, so long as we reject, through a vitiated taste, the
   righteousness of God. From this we may again deduce another evidence,
   that David's discourse is not to be understood simply of the
   commandments, and of the dead letter, but that he comprehends, at the
   same time, the promises by which the grace of God is offered to us. If
   the law did nothing else but command us, how could it be loved, since
   in commanding it terrifies us, because we all fail in keeping it? [462]
   Certainly, if we separate the law from the hope of pardon, and from the
   Spirit of Christ, so far from tasting it to be sweet as honey, we will
   rather find in it a bitterness which kills our wretched souls.

   11. Moreover, by them is thy servant made circumspect. These words may
   be extended generally to all the people of God; but they are properly
   to be understood of David himself, and by them he testifies that he
   knew well, from his own experience, all that he had stated in the
   preceding verses respecting the law. No man will ever speak truly and
   in good earnest of heavenly truth, but he who has it deeply fixed in
   his own heart. David therefore acknowledges, that whatever prudence he
   had for regulating and framing his life aright, he was indebted for it
   to the law of God. Although, however, it is properly of himself that he
   speaks, yet by his own example he sets forth a general rule, namely,
   that if persons wish to have a proper method for governing the life
   well, the law of God alone is perfectly sufficient for this purpose;
   but that, on the contrary, as soon as persons depart from it, they are
   liable to fall into numerous errors and sins. It is to be observed that
   David, by all at once turning his discourse to God, appeals to him as a
   witness of what he had said, the more effectually to convince men that
   he speaks sincerely and from the bottom of his heart. As the Hebrew
   word zhr, zahar, which I have translated made circumspect, signifies to
   teach, as well as to be on one's guard, some translate it in this
   place, Thy servant is taught, or warned, by the commandments of the
   law. But the sentence implies much more, when it is viewed as meaning
   that he who yields himself to God to be governed by him is made
   circumspect and cautious, and, therefore, this translation seems to me
   to be preferable. In the second clause the Psalmist declares, that
   whoever yield themselves to God to observe the rule of righteousness
   which he prescribes, do not lose their labor, seeing he has in reserve
   for them a great and rich reward: In keeping of them there is great
   reward. It is no mean commendation of the law when it is said, that in
   it God enters into covenant with us, and, so to speak, brings himself
   under obligation to recompense our obedience. In requiring from us
   whatever is contained in the law, he demands nothing but what he has a
   right to; yet such is his free and undeserved liberality, that he
   promises to his servants a reward, which, in point of justice, he does
   not owe them. The promises of the law, it is true, are made of no
   effect; but it is through our fault: for even he who is most perfect
   amongst us comes far short of full and complete righteousness; and men
   cannot expect any reward for their works until they have perfectly and
   to the full satisfied the requirements of the law. Thus these two
   doctrines completely harmonize: first, that eternal life shall be given
   as the reward of works to him who fulfils the law in all points; and,
   secondly, that the law notwithstanding denounces a curse against all
   men, because the whole human family are destitute of the righteousness
   of works. This will presently appear from the following verse. David,
   after having celebrated this benefit of the law - that it offers an
   abundant reward to those who serve God -- immediately changes his
   discourse, and cries out, Who can understand his errors? by which he
   pronounces all men liable to eternal death, and thus utterly overthrows
   all the confidence which men may be disposed to place in the merit of
   their works. It may be objected, that this commendation, In the keeping
   of thy commandments there is great reward, is in vain ascribed to the
   law, seeing it is without effect. The answer is easy, namely, that as
   in the covenant of adoption there is included the free pardon of sins,
   upon which depends the imputation of righteousness, God bestows a
   recompense upon the works of his people, although, in point of justice,
   it is not due to them. What God promises in the law to those who
   perfectly obey it, true believers obtain by his gracious liberality and
   fatherly goodness, inasmuch as he accepts for perfect righteousness
   their holy desires and earnest endeavors to obey.

   Psalm 19:12-14

   12. Who can understand his errors? [463] Cleanse thou me from my secret
   sins. 13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, [464] that
   they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright and clean
   from much wickedness. [465] 14. Let the words of my mouth, and the
   meditations of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my
   strength and my redeemer.


   12. Who can understand his errors? This exclamation shows us what use
   we should make of the promises of the law, which have a condition
   annexed to them. It is this: As soon as they come forth, every man
   should examine his own life, and compare not only his actions, but also
   his thoughts, with that perfect rule of righteousness which is laid
   down in the law. Thus it will come to pass, that all, from the least to
   the greatest, seeing themselves cut off from all hope of reward from
   the law, will be constrained to flee for refuge to the mercy of God. It
   is not enough to consider what the doctrine of the law contains; we
   must also look into ourselves, that we may see how far short we have
   come in our obedience to the law. Whenever the Papists hear this
   promise,

   "He who doeth these things shall live in them,"
   (Leviticus 18:5,)

   they do not hesitate at once to connect eternal life with the merit of
   their works, as if it were in their own power to fulfill the law, of
   which we are all transgressors, not only in one point, but in all its
   parts. David, therefore, being involved as it were in a labyrinth on
   all sides, acknowledges with astonishment that he is overwhelmed under
   a sense of the multitude of his sins. We ought then to remember, in the
   first place, that as we are personally destitute of the righteousness
   which the law requires, we are on that account excluded from the hope
   of the reward which the law has promised; and, in the next place, that
   we are guilty before God, not of one fault or of two, but of sins
   innumerable, so that we ought, with the bitterest sorrow, to bewail our
   depravity, which not only deprives us of the blessing of God, but also
   turns to us life into death. This David did. There is no doubt that
   when, after having said that God liberally offers a reward to all who
   observe his law, he cried out, Who can understand his errors? it was
   from the terror with which he was stricken in thinking upon his sins.
   By the Hebrew word sgy'vt, shegioth, which we have translated errors,
   some think David intends lesser faults; but in my judgment he meant
   simply to say, that Satan has so many devices by which he deludes and
   blinds our minds, that there is not a man who knows the hundredth part
   of his own sins. The saints, it is true, often offend in lesser
   matters, through ignorance and inadvertence; but it happens also that,
   being entangled in the snares of Satan, they do not perceive even the
   grosser faults which they have committed. Accordingly, all the sins to
   the commission of which men give themselves loose reins, not being duly
   sensible of the evil which is in them, and being deceived by the
   allurements of the flesh, are justly included under the Hebrew word
   here used by David, which signifies faults or ignorances. [466] In
   summoning himself and others before the judgment-seat of God, he warns
   himself and them, that although their consciences do not condemn them,
   they are not on that account absolved; for God sees far more clearly
   than men's consciences, since even those who look most attentively into
   themselves, do not perceive a great part of the sins with which they
   are chargeable.

   After making this confession, David adds a prayer for pardon, Cleanse
   thou me from my secret sins. The word cleanse is to be referred not to
   the blessing of regeneration, but to free forgiveness; for the Hebrew
   verb nqh, nakah, here used, comes from a word which signifies to be
   innocent. The Psalmist explains more clearly what he intended by the
   word errors, in now calling them secret sins; that is to say, those
   with respect to which men deceive themselves, by thinking that they are
   no sins, and who thus deceive themselves not only purposely and by
   expressly aiming at doing so, but because they do not enter into the
   due consideration of the majesty of the judgment of God. It is in vain
   to attempt to justify ourselves under the pretext and excuse of
   ignorance. Nor does it avail any thing to be blind as to our faults,
   since no man is a competent judge in his own cause. We must, therefore,
   never account ourselves to be pure and innocent until we are pronounced
   such by God's sentence of absolution or acquittal. The faults which we
   do not perceive must necessarily come under the review of God's
   judgment, and entail upon us condemnation, unless he blot them out and
   pardon them; and if so, how shall he escape and remain unpunished who,
   besides these, is chargeable with sins of which he knows himself to be
   guilty, and on account of which his own conscience compels him to judge
   and condemn himself? Farther, we should remember that we are not guilty
   of one offense only, but are overwhelmed with an immense mass of
   impurities. The more diligently any one examines himself, the more
   readily will he acknowledge with David, that if God should discover our
   secret faults, there would be found in us an abyss of sins so great as
   to have neither bottom nor shore, as we say; [467] for no man can
   comprehend in how many ways he is guilty before God. From this also it
   appears, that the Papists are bewitched, and chargeable with the
   grossest hypocrisy, when they pretend that they can easily and speedily
   gather all their sins once a year into a bundle. The decree of the
   Lateran Council commands every one to confess all his sins once every
   year, and at the same time declares that there is no hope of pardon but
   in complying with that decree. Accordingly, the blinded Papist, by
   going to the confessional, to mutter his sins into the ear of the
   priest, thinks he has done all that is required, as if he could count
   upon his fingers all the sins which he has committed during the course
   of the whole year; whereas, even the saints, by strictly examining
   themselves, can scarcely come to the knowledge of the hundredth part of
   their sins, and, therefore, with one voice unite with David in saying,
   Who can understand his errors? Nor will it do to allege that it is
   enough if each performs the duty of reckoning up his sins to the utmost
   of his ability. This does not diminish, in any degree, the absurdity of
   this famous decree. [468] As it is impossible for us to do what the law
   requires, all whose hearts are really and deeply imbued with the
   principle of the fear of God must necessarily be overwhelmed with
   despair, so long as they think themselves bound to enumerate all their
   sins, in order to their being pardoned; and those who imagine they can
   disburden themselves of their sins in this way must be persons
   altogether stupid. I know that some explain these words in a different
   sense, viewing them as a prayer, in which David beseeches God, by the
   guidance of his Holy Spirit, to recover him from all his errors. But,
   in my opinion, they are to be viewed rather as a prayer for
   forgiveness, and what follows in the next verse is a prayer for the aid
   of the Holy Spirit, and for success to overcome temptations.

   13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. By presumptuous
   sins he means known and evident transgressions, [469] accompanied with
   proud contempt and obstinacy. By the word keep back, he intimates, that
   such is the natural propensity of the flesh to sin, that even the
   saints themselves would immediately break forth or rush headlong into
   it, did not God, by his own guardianship and protection, keep them
   back. It is to be observed, that while he calls himself the servant of
   God, he nevertheless acknowledges that he had need of the bridle, lest
   he should arrogantly and rebelliously break forth in transgressing the
   law of God. Being regenerated by the Spirit of God, he groaned, it is
   true, under the burden of his sins; but he knew, on the other hand, how
   great is the rebellion of the flesh, and how much we are inclined to
   forgetfulness of God, from which proceed contempt of his majesty and
   all impiety. Now, if David, who had made so much progress in the fear
   of God, was not beyond the danger of transgressing, how shall the
   carnal and unrenewed man, in whom innumerable lusts exercise dominion,
   be able to restrain and govern himself by his own free will? Let us
   learn, then, even although the unruliness of our wayward flesh has been
   already subdued by the denial of ourselves, to walk in fear and
   trembling; for unless God restrain us, our hearts will violently boil
   with a proud and insolent contempt of God. This sense is confirmed by
   the reason added immediately after, that they may not have dominion
   over me. By these words he expressly declares, that unless God assist
   him, he will not only be unable to resist, but will be wholly brought
   under the dominion of the worst vices. This passage, therefore, teaches
   us not only that all mankind are naturally enslaved to sin, but that
   the faithful themselves would become the bond-slaves of sin also, if
   God did not unceasingly watch over them to guide them in the path of
   holiness, and to strengthen them for persevering in it. There is also
   another useful lesson which we have here to attend to, namely, that we
   ought never to pray for pardon, without, at the same time, asking to be
   strengthened and fortified by the power of God for the time to come,
   that temptations, in future, may not gain advantage over us. And
   although we may feel in our hearts the incitements of concupiscence
   goading and distressing us, we ought not, on that account, to become
   discouraged. The remedy to which we should have recourse is to pray to
   God to restrain us. No doubt, David could have wished to feel in his
   heart no stirrings of corruption; but knowing that he would never be
   wholly free from the remains of sin, until at death he had put off this
   corrupt nature, he prays to be armed with the grace of the Holy Spirit
   for the combat, that iniquity might not reign victorious over him. In
   the end of the verse there are two things to be observed. David, in
   affirming that he shall then be upright and clean from much wickedness,
   attributes, in the first place, the honor of preserving him innocent to
   the spiritual assistance of God; and depending upon it, he confidently
   assures himself of victory over all the armies of Satan. In the second
   place, he acknowledges, that unless he is assisted by God, he will be
   overwhelmed with an immense load, and plunged as it were into a
   boundless abyss of wickedness: for he says, that aided by God, he will
   be clear not of one fault or of two, but of many. From this it follows,
   that as soon as we are abandoned by the grace of God, there is no kind
   of sin in which Satan may not entangle us. Let this confession of David
   then quicken us to earnestness in prayer; for in the midst of so many
   and various snares, it does not become us to fall asleep or to be
   indolent. Again, let the other part of the Psalmist's exercise
   predominate in our hearts -- let us boast with him, that although Satan
   may assault us by many and strong armies, we will nevertheless be
   invincible, provided we have the aid of God, and will continue, in
   despite of every hostile attempt, to hold fast our integrity.

   14. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart. David
   asks still more expressly to be fortified by the grace of God, and thus
   enabled to live an upright and holy life. The substance of the verse is
   this: I beseech thee, O God, not only to keep me from breaking forth
   into the external acts of transgression, but also to frame my tongue
   and my heart to the obedience of thy law. We know how difficult it is,
   even for the most perfect, so to bridle their words and thoughts, as
   that nothing may pass through their heart or mouth which is contrary to
   the will of God; and yet this inward purity is what the law chiefly
   requires of us. Now, the rarer this virtue -- the rarer this strict
   control of the heart and of the tongue is, let us learn so much the
   more the necessity of our being governed by the Holy Spirit, in order
   to regulate our life uprightly and honestly. By the word acceptable,
   the Psalmist shows that the only rule of living well is for men to
   endeavor to please God, and to be approved of him. The concluding
   words, in which he calls God his strength and his redeemer, he employs
   to confirm himself in the assured confidence of obtaining his requests.

   PSALM 20.

   This psalm contains a common prayer of the Church in behalf of the King
   of Israel, that God would succor him in danger; and in behalf of his
   kingdom, that God would maintain it in safety, and cause it to prosper:
   for in the person of David the safety and well-being of the whole
   community centred. To this there is added a promise, that God will
   preside over that kingdom of which he was the founder, and so
   effectually watch over it as to secure its continual preservation.

   To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 20:1-2

   1. May Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble! may the name of the God
   of Jacob defend thee! 2. May he send thee help from his sanctuary, and
   sustain thee out of Sion!


   The inscription shows that the psalm was composed by David; but though
   he was its author, there is no absurdity in his speaking of himself in
   the person of others. The office of a prophet having been committed to
   him, he with great propriety prepared this as a form of prayer for the
   use of the faithful. In doing this, his object was not so much to
   commend his own person, by authoritatively issuing a royal ordinance
   enjoining upon the people the use of this prayer, as to show, in the
   exercise of his office as a teacher, that it belonged to the whole
   Church to concern itself, and to use its endeavors that the kingdom
   which God had erected might continue safe and prosperous. Many
   interpreters view this prayer as offered up only on one particular
   occasion; but in this I cannot agree. The occasion of its composition
   at first may have arisen from some particular battle which was about to
   be fought, either against the Ammonites, or against some other enemies
   of Israel. But the design of the Holy Spirit, in my judgment, was to
   deliver to the Church a common form of prayer, which, as we may gather
   from the words, was to be used whenever she was threatened with any
   danger. God commands his people, in general, to pray for kings, but
   there was a special reason, and one which did not apply to any other
   kingdom, why prayer was to be made in behalf of this kingdom; for it
   was only by the hand of David and his seed that God had determined to
   govern and maintain his people. It is particularly to be noticed, that
   under the figure of this temporal kingdom, there was described a
   government far more excellent, on which the whole joy and felicity of
   the Church depended. The object, therefore, which David had expressly
   in view was, to exhort all the children of God to cherish such a holy
   solicitude about the kingdom of Christ, as would stir them up to
   continual prayer in its behalf.

   1. May Jehovah hear thee, etc. The Holy Spirit, by introducing the
   people as praying that God would answer the prayers of the king, is to
   be viewed as at the same time admonishing kings that it is their duty
   to implore the protection of God in all their affairs. When he says, In
   the day of trouble, he shows that they will not be exempted from
   troubles, and he does this that they may not become discouraged, if at
   any time they should happen to be in circumstances of danger. In short,
   the faithful, that the body may not be separated from the head, further
   the king's prayers by their common and united supplications. The name
   of God is here put for God himself and not without good reason; for the
   essence of God being incomprehensible to us, it behoves us to trust in
   him, in so far as his grace and power are made known to us. From his
   name, therefore, proceeds confidence in calling upon him. The faithful
   desire that the king may be protected and aided by God, whose name was
   called upon among the sons of Jacob. I cannot agree with those who
   think that mention is here made of that patriarch, because God
   exercised him with various afflictions, not unlike those with which he
   tried his servant David. I am rather of opinion that, as is usual in
   Scripture, the chosen people are denoted by the term Jacob. And from
   this name, the God of Jacob, the faithful encourage themselves to pray
   for the defense of their king; because it was one of the privileges of
   their adoption to live under the conduct and protection of a king set
   over them by God himself. Hence we may conclude, as I have said before,
   that under the figure of a temporal kingdom there is described to us a
   government much more excellent. [470] Since Christ our King, being an
   everlasting priest, never ceases to make intercession with God, the
   whole body of the Church should unite in prayer with him; [471] and
   farther, we can have no hope of being heard except he go before us, and
   conduct us to God. [472] And it serves in no small degree to assuage
   our sorrows to consider that Jesus Christ, when we are afflicted,
   accounts our distresses his own, provided we, at the same time, take
   courage, and continue resolute and magnanimous in tribulation; which we
   should be prepared to do, since the Holy Spirit here forewarns us that
   the kingdom of Christ would be subject to dangers and troubles.

   2. May he send thee help. That is to say, may he succor thee out of
   mount Sion, where he commanded the ark of the covenant to be placed,
   and chose for himself a dwelling-place. The weakness of the flesh will
   not suffer men to soar up to heaven, and, therefore, God comes down to
   meet them, and by the external means of grace shows that he is near
   them. Thus the ark of the covenant was to his ancient people a pledge
   of his presence, and the sanctuary an image of heaven. But as God, by
   appointing mount Sion to be the place where the faithful should
   continually worship him, had joined the kingdom and priesthood
   together, David, in putting into the lips of the people a prayer for
   help out of Sion, doubtless had an eye to this sacred bond of union.
   Hence I conjecture that this psalm was composed by David in his old
   age, and about the close of his life. Some think he spake of Sion by
   the Spirit of prophecy before it had been appointed that the ark should
   be placed there; but this opinion seems strained, and to have little
   probability.

   Psalm 20:3-5

   3. May he remember all thy offerings; and make thy holocaust [or burnt
   sacrifice] fat! [473] Selah. 4. May he grant thee according to thy
   heart, and fulfill all thy counsel! 5. That we may rejoice in thy
   salvation, [or safety;] and set up a banner in the name of our God,
   when Jehovah shall fulfill all thy petitions.


   3. May he remember. I understand the word remember as meaning to have
   regard to, as it is to be understood in many other places; just as to
   forget often signifies to neglect, or not to deign to regard, nor even
   to behold, the object to which it is applied. It is, in short, a prayer
   that God would actually show that the king's sacrifices were acceptable
   to him. Two kinds of them are here mentioned; first, the mnchh, mincha,
   mentioned in the first clause of the verse, which was the appointed
   accompaniment of all sacrifices, and which was also sometimes offered
   by itself; and, secondly, the holocaust, or whole burnt-sacrifice. But
   under these two kinds David intended to comprehend, by synecdoche, all
   sacrifices; and under sacrifices he comprehends requests and prayers.
   We know that whenever the fathers prayed under the law, their hope of
   obtaining what they asked was founded upon their sacrifices; and, in
   like manner, at this day our prayers are acceptable to God only in so
   far as Christ sprinkles and sanctifies them with the perfume of his own
   sacrifice. The faithful, therefore, here desire that the solemn prayers
   of the king, which were accompanied with sacrifices and oblations,
   might have their effect in the prosperous issue of his affairs. That
   this is the meaning may be gathered still more clearly from the
   following verse, in which they commend to God the desires and counsels
   of the king. But as it would be absurd to ask God to grant foolish and
   wicked desires, it is to be regarded as certain, that there is here
   described a king who was neither given to ambition, nor inflamed with
   avarice, nor actuated by the desire of whatever the unruly passions
   might suggest, but wholly intent on the charge which was committed to
   him, and entirely devoted to the advancement of the public good; so
   that he asks nothing but what the Holy Spirit dictated to him, and what
   God, by his own mouth, commanded him to ask.

   5. That we may rejoice in thy salvation. This verse may be explained in
   two other ways, besides the sense it bears according to the translation
   which I have given. Some consider it to be a prayer, as if it had been
   said, Lord, make us to rejoice. Others think that the faithful, after
   having finished their prayer, encourage themselves to entertain good
   hope; [474] or rather, being already inspired with an assured hope of
   success, they begin to sing, so to speak, of the victory, even as it is
   usual with David to intermingle such kind of rejoicings with his
   prayers, thereby to stir up himself to continue with the more alacrity
   in prayer. But upon considering the whole more carefully, my opinion
   is, that what is meant to be expressed is the effect or fruit which
   would result from the bestowment of the grace and favor of God, for
   which the people prayed; and, therefore, I have thought it necessary to
   supply the particle that, in the beginning of the verse. The faithful,
   as an argument to obtain the favor of God towards their king, set forth
   the joy which they would all experience in common, in seeing it
   exercised towards him, and the thanksgiving which they would with one
   accord render for it. The import of their language is, It is not for
   the preservation and welfare of one man that we are solicitous; it is
   for the safety and well-being of the whole Church. The expression, In
   thy salvation, may be referred to God as well as to the king; for the
   salvation which God bestows is often called the salvation of God; but
   the context requires that it should be rather understood of the king.
   The people lived "under the shadow of the king," to use the words of
   Jeremiah, (Lamentations 4:20;) and, therefore, the faithful now
   testify, that as long as he is safe and in prosperity, they will all be
   joyful and happy. At the same time, to distinguish their joy from the
   heathen dancings and rejoicings, they declare that they will set up
   their banners in the name of God; for the Hebrew word dgl, dagal, here
   used, means to set or lift up a banner. The meaning is, that the
   faithful, in grateful acknowledgement of the grace of God, will
   celebrate his praises and triumph in his name.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [473] That is, May he accept it! The best and fattest of the flocks and
   herds were, according to the Mosaic injunction, to be offered to God,
   and were consequently the sacrifices he most approved of.

   our God will we set up our banners."

   Psalm 20:6-9

   6. Now I know that Jehovah hath saved his anointed; he will hear him
   from the heavens of his sanctuary, in the mightiness of the salvation
   of his right hand. [475] 7. Some trust [476] in chariots, and some in
   horses; but we will remember the name of Jehovah our God. 8. They are
   bowed down and are fallen; but we are risen and are erect. 9. Save, O
   Jehovah! let the king hear us in the day that we call upon him.


   6. Now I know. Here there follows grateful rejoicing, in which the
   faithful declare that they have experienced the goodness of God in the
   preservation of the king. To this there is at the same time added a
   doctrine of faith, namely, that God showed by the effect that he put
   forth his power in maintaining the kingdom of David, because it was
   founded upon his calling. The meaning is, It appears from certain
   experience, that God is the guardian of the kingdom which he himself
   set up, and of which he is the founder. For David is called Messiah, or
   anointed, that the faithful might be persuaded that he was a lawful and
   sacred king, whom God had testified, by outward anointing, to be chosen
   by himself. Thus, then, the faithful ascribe to the grace of God the
   deliverance which had been wrought for David from the greatest dangers,
   and at the same time, particularly mention the cause of this to be,
   that God had determined to protect and defend him who, by his
   commandment, had been anointed king over his people. They confirm still
   more clearly their hope, with respect to the future, in the following
   clause: God will hear him out of heaven I do not translate the verb
   which is here used into the past tense, but retain the future: for I
   have no doubt, that from the experience which God had already given
   them of his goodness, they concluded that it would be hereafter
   exercised in the continual preservation of the kingdom. Here the
   Psalmist makes mention of another sanctuary, [477] namely, a heavenly.
   As God then graciously vouchsafed to descend among the Israelites, by
   the ark of the covenant, in order to make himself more familiarly known
   to them; so, on the other hand, he intended to draw the minds of his
   people upwards to himself, and thereby to prevent them from forming
   carnal and earthly conceptions of his character, and to teach them that
   he was greater than the whole world. Thus, under the visible sanctuary,
   which was made with hands, there is set forth the fatherly goodness of
   God, and his familiarity with his people; while, under the heavenly
   sanctuary, there is shown his infinite power, dominion, and majesty.
   The words, In the mightiness of the salvation, mean his mighty
   salvation, or his saving power. Thus, in the very expression there is a
   transposing of the words. The sense comes to this: May God by his
   wonderful power, preserve the king who was anointed by his commandment!
   The Holy Spirit, who dictated this prayer, saw well that Satan would
   not suffer David to live in peace, but would put forth all his efforts
   to oppose him, which would render it necessary for him to be sustained
   by more than human power. I do not, however, disapprove of the other
   exposition which I have marked on the margin, according to which the
   faithful, for their greater encouragement, set before themselves this
   truth, that the salvation of God's right hand is in mightiness; in
   other words, is sufficiently strong to overcome all impediments.

   7. Some trust in chariots. I do not restrict this to the enemies of
   Israel, as is done by other interpreters. I am rather inclined to think
   that there is here a comparison between the people of God and all the
   rest of the world. We see how natural it is to almost all men to be the
   more courageous and confident the more they possess of riches, power
   and military forces. The people of God, therefore, here protest that
   they do not place their hope, as is the usual way with men, in their
   military forces and warlike apparatus, but only in the aid of God. As
   the Holy Spirit here sets the assistance of God in opposition to human
   strength, it ought to be particularly noticed, that whenever our minds
   come to be occupied by carnal confidence, they fall at the same time
   into a forgetfulness of God. It is impossible for him, who promises
   himself victory by confiding in his own strength, to have his eyes
   turned towards God. The inspired writer, therefore, uses the word
   remember, to show, that when the saints betake themselves to God, they
   must cast off every thing which would hinder them from placing an
   exclusive trust in him. This remembrance of God serves two important
   purposes to the faithful. In the first place, however much power and
   resources they may possess, it nevertheless withdraws them from all
   vain confidence, so that they do not expect any success except from the
   pure grace of God. In the second place, if they are bereft and utterly
   destitute of all succor, it notwithstanding so strengthens and
   encourages them, that they call upon God both with confidence and
   constancy. On the other hand, when ungodly men feel themselves strong
   and powerful, being blinded with pride, they do not hesitate boldly to
   despise God; but when they are brought into circumstances of distress,
   they are so terrified as not to know what to become. In short, the Holy
   Spirit here recommends to us the remembrance of God, which, retaining
   its efficacy both in the want and in the abundance of power, subdues
   the vain hopes with which the flesh is wont to be inflated. As the verb
   nzkyr, nazkir, which I have translated we will remember, is in the
   conjugation hiphil, some render it transitively, we shall cause to
   remember. But it is no new thing in Hebrew for verbs to be used as
   neuter which are properly transitive; and, therefore, I have adopted
   the exposition which seems to me the most suitable to this passage.

   8. They are bowed down. It is probable that there is here pointed out,
   as it were with the finger, the enemies of Israel, whom God had
   overthrown, when they regarded no event as less likely to happen. There
   is contained in the words a tacit contrast between the cruel pride with
   which they had been lifted up for a time when they audaciously rushed
   forward to make havoc of all things on the one hand, and the oppression
   of the people of God on the other. The expression, to rise, is applied
   only to those who were before sunk or fallen; and, on the other hand,
   the expression, bowed down and fallen, is with propriety applied to
   those who were lifted up with pride and presumption. The prophet
   therefore teaches by the event, how much more advantageous it is for us
   to place all our confidence in God than to depend upon our own
   strength.

   9. Save, O Jehovah! etc. Some read in one sentence, O Jehovah! save the
   king; [478] perhaps because they think it wrong to attribute to an
   earthly king what is proper to God only, -- to be called upon, and to
   hear prayer. But if we turn our eyes towards Christ, as it becomes us
   to do, we will no longer wonder that what properly belongs to him is
   attributed in a certain sense to David and his successors, in so far as
   they were types of Christ. As God governs and saves us by the hand of
   Christ, we must not look for salvation from any other quarter. In like
   manner, the faithful under the former economy were accustomed to betake
   themselves to their king as the minister of God's saving grace. Hence
   these words of Jeremiah,

   "The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, of whom we said,
   Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen." (Lamentations 4:20)

   Whenever, therefore, God promises the restoration of his church, he
   sets forth a symbol or pledge of its salvation in the kingdom. We now
   see that it is not without very good reason that the faithful are
   introduced asking succor from their king, under whose guardianship and
   protection they were placed, and who, as the vicegerent of God,
   presided over them; as the Prophet Micah says, (Micah 2:13,) "Their
   king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them;" by
   which words he intimates, that their king will be as it were a mirror
   in which they may see reflected the image of God. To return to the
   present passage:-- The expression, Save, O Jehovah, is elliptical, but
   it has greater emphasis than if the object for which salvation is
   sought had been mentioned; for by this means David shows that this
   salvation belongs in common to the whole body of the church. In Psalm
   118:25, there is a prayer in the same words, and it is certain that it
   is the very same prayer. In short, this is a prayer, that God, by
   blessing the king, would show himself the Savior of the whole people.
   In the last clause of the verse there is expressed the means of this
   salvation. The people pray that the king may be furnished with power
   from God to deliver them whenever they are in distress, and cry to him
   for help. Let the king hear us in the day that we call upon him. God
   had not promised that his people would be saved in any other way than
   by the hand and conduct of the king whom he had given them. In the
   present day, when Christ is now manifested to us, let us learn to yield
   him this honor -- to renounce all hope of salvation from any other
   quarter, and to trust to that salvation only which he shall bring to us
   from God his Father. And of this we shall then only become partakers
   when, being all gathered together into one body, under the same Head,
   we shall have mutual care one of another, and when none of us will have
   his attention so engrossed with his own advantage and individual
   interest, as to be indifferent to the welfare and happiness of others.

   [475] "Ou A puissances le salut de sa dextre." -- Fr. marg. "In
   mightiness the salvation of his right hand." The rendering which
   Horsley gives is this: "In powers or in strengths, salvation of his
   right hand" and he views this clause as a complete sentence by itself.
   He explains it thus: -- "In situations of power and strength, whatever
   a man's natural means of deliverance may be, his preservation must be
   the work of God's right hand." "This seems," says he, "to be the best
   exposition of this line, which is a clause by itself, not a part of the
   preceding sentence; ys is a noun substantive, the subject of the verb
   substantive understood. The chariots and horses mentioned in the next
   verse are expository of grrt in this line, and all that follows of this
   psalm is an amplification of his general sentiment."

   [476] In the Hebrew text there is here an ellipsis, the reading being,
   "Some in chariots, and some in horses" etc. All the ancient versions
   read the words as they are in the Hebrew text, without supplying any
   verb. Calvin does the same in his Latin version; but in the French he
   supplies the verb "Se foyent," "trust," the same supplement as that
   which is made in our English version.

   [477] Different from "the sanctuary" mentioned in verse second.

   [478] This is the reading of the Septuagint. Its words are, Kurie soson
   ton basilea. The reading of the Vulgate is the same. Calvin's
   rendering, which is also that of our English version, agrees with the
   masoretical punctuation; but the Septuagint has followed a different
   pointing.

   PSALM 21.

   This psalm contains a public and solemn thanksgiving for the prosperous
   and happy condition of the king. Its subject is almost the same with
   that of the preceding. [479] In the former there was set forth a common
   form of prayer, which was designed to excite in the whole people
   earnest concern for the preservation of their head. In this it is shown
   that the safety and prosperity of the king ought to produce public and
   general rejoicing through the whole realm, inasmuch as God by this
   means intended to preserve the whole body in safety. But, above all, it
   was the design of the Holy Spirit here to direct the minds of the
   faithful to Christ, who was the end and perfection of this kingdom, and
   to teach them that they could not be saved except under the head which
   God himself had appointed over them.

   To the chief musician. A psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 21:1-3

   1. The king will rejoice in thy strength, O Yehovah! and in thy
   salvation how greatly will he rejoice! 2. Thou hast given him the
   desire of his heart, and hast not denied him the request of his lips.
   Selah. 3. For thou wilt prevent him with blessings of good, thou wilt
   set a crown of gold upon his head. [480]


   1. The king will rejoice in thy strength, O Jehovah! David could have
   given thanks to God in private for the victories and other signal
   favors which he had received from him; but it was his intention to
   testify not only that it was God who elevated him to the throne, but
   also that whatever blessings God had conferred upon him redounded to
   the public good, and the advantage of all the faithful. In the
   beginning of the psalm the believing Israelites express their firm
   persuasion that God, who had created David to be king, had undertaken
   to defend and maintain him. It therefore appears that this psalm, as
   well as the preceding, was composed for the purpose of assuring the
   faithful that the goodness of God in this respect towards David would
   be of long duration, and permanent; and it was necessary, in order to
   their being established in a well-grounded confidence of their safety;
   to hope well of their king, whose countenance was as it were a mirror
   of the merciful and reconciled countenance of God. The sense of the
   words is: Lord, in putting forth thy power to sustain and protect the
   king, thou wilt preserve him safe; and, ascribing his safety to thy
   power, he will greatly rejoice in thee. The Psalmist has doubtless put
   strength and salvation for strong and powerful succor; intimating, that
   the power of God in defending the king would be such as would preserve
   and protect him against all dangers.

   In the second verse there is pointed out the cause of this joy. The
   cause was this: that God had heard the prayers of the king, and had
   liberally granted him whatever he desired. It was important to be
   known, and that the faithful should have it deeply impressed on their
   minds, that all David's successes were so many benefits conferred upon
   him by God, and at the same time testimonies of his lawful calling. And
   David, there is no doubt, in speaking thus, testifies that he did not
   give loose reins to the desires of the flesh, and follow the mere
   impulse of his appetites like worldly men, who set their minds at one
   time upon this thing, and at another time upon that, without any
   consideration, and just as they are led by their sensual lusts; but
   that he had so bridled his affections as to desire nothing save what
   was good and lawful. According to the infirmity which is natural to
   men, he was, it is true, chargeable with some vices, and even fell
   shamefully on two occasions; but the habitual administration of his
   kingdom was such that it was easy to see that the Holy Spirit presided
   over it. But as by the Spirit of prophecy the Psalmist had principally
   an eye to Christ, who does not reign for his own advantage, but for
   ours, and whose desire is directed only to our salvation, we may gather
   hence the very profitable doctrine, that we need entertain no
   apprehension that God will reject our prayers in behalf of the church,
   since our heavenly King has gone before us in making intercession for
   her, so that in praying for her we are only endeavoring to follow his
   example.

   3. For thou wilt prevent him. The change of the tense in the verbs does
   not break the connection of the discourse; and, therefore, I have,
   without hesitation, translated this sentence into the future tense, as
   we know that the changing of one tense into another is quite common in
   Hebrew. Those who limit this psalm to the last victory which David
   gained over foreign nations, and who suppose that the crown of which
   mention is here made was the crown of the king of the Ammonites, of
   which we have an account in sacred history, give, in my judgment, too
   low a view of what the Holy Spirit has here dictated concerning the
   perpetual prosperity of this kingdom. David, I have no doubt,
   comprehended his successors even to Christ, and intended to celebrate
   the continual course of the grace of God in maintaining his kingdom
   through successive ages. It was not of one man that it had been said,

   "I will be his father, and he shall be my son,"
   (2 Samuel 7:14;)

   but this was a prophecy which ought to be extended from Solomon to
   Christ, as is fully established by the testimony of Isaiah, (Isaiah
   9:6,) who informs us that it was fulfilled when the Son was given or
   manifested. When it is said, Thou wilt prevent him, the meaning is,
   that such will be the liberality and promptitude of God, in
   spontaneously bestowing blessings, that he will not only grant what is
   asked from him, but, anticipating the requests of the king, will load
   him with every kind of good things far beyond what he had ever
   expected. By blessings we are to understand abundance or plenteousness.
   Some translate the Hebrew word tvv, tob, goodness; [481] but with this
   I cannot agree. It is to be taken rather for the beneficence or the
   free gifts of God. Thus the meaning will be, The king shall want
   nothing which is requisite to make his life in every respect happy,
   since God of his own good pleasure will anticipate his wishes, and
   enrich him with an abundance of all good things. The Psalmist makes
   express mention of the crown, because it was the emblem and ensign of
   royalty; and he intimates by this that God would be the guardian of the
   king, whom he himself had created. But as the prophet testifies, that
   the royal diadem, after lying long dishonored in the dust, shall again
   be put upon the head of Christ, we come to the conclusion, that by this
   song the minds of the godly were elevated to the hope of the eternal
   kingdom, of which a shadow only, or an obscure image, was set forth in
   the person of the successors of David. The doctrine of the everlasting
   duration of the kingdom of Christ is, therefore, here established,
   seeing he was not placed upon the throne by the favor or suffrages of
   men, but by God, who, from heaven, set the royal crown upon his head
   with his own hand.

   Psalm 21:4-6

   4. He asked life from thee, and thou hast given him length of days for
   ever and ever. 5. His glory is great in thy salvation: thou hast put
   upon him splendor and beauty. [482] 6. For thou hast set him to be
   blessings for ever: thou hast gladdened him with joy before thy
   countenance, [or, in thy presence.]


   4. He asked life from thee. This verse confirms what I have formerly
   said, that this psalm is not to be limited to the person of any one
   man. David's life, it is true, was prolonged to an advanced period, so
   that, when he departed from this world, he was an old man, and full of
   days; but the course of his life was too short to be compared to this
   length of days, which is said to consist of many ages. Even if we
   reckon the time from the commencement of David's reign to the captivity
   of Babylon, this length of days will not be made up and completed in
   all David's successors. David, therefore, without doubt, comprehends
   the Eternal King. There is here a tacit comparison between the
   beginnings of this kingdom, which were obscure and contemptible, or
   rather which were fraught with the most grievous perils, and which
   bordered on despair; and the incredible glory which followed, when God,
   exempting it from the common lot of other kingdoms, elevated it almost
   above the heavens. For it is no ordinary commendation of this kingdom,
   when it is said, that it shall endure as long as the sun and moon shall
   shine in the heavens, (Psalm 72:1.) David, therefore, in saying that he
   asked life, tacitly points to the distressed circumstances to which he
   had often been reduced; and the meaning is, Lord, since the time thou
   hast called thy servant to the hope of the kingdom by thy holy
   anointing, his condition has been such that he has accounted it a
   singular blessing to be rescued from the jaws of death; but now, he has
   not only, by thy grace, escaped in safety the dangers which threatened
   his life: thou hast also promised that his kingdom will be continued
   for many ages in his successors. And it serves not a little to magnify
   the grace of God, that he vouchsafed to confer on a poor and miserable
   man, who was almost at the point of death, not only his life, - when,
   amidst the dangers which threatened it, he tremblingly asked merely its
   preservations -- but also the inestimable honor of elevating him to the
   royal dignity, and of transmitting the kingdom to his posterity for
   ever. Some expound the verse thus:-- Thou hast given him the life which
   he asked, even to the prolonging of his days for ever and ever. But
   this seems to me a cold and strained interpretation. We must keep in
   view the contrast which, as I have said, is here made between the weak
   and contemptible beginnings of the kingdom, and the unexpected honor
   which God conferred upon his servant, in calling the moon to witness
   that his seed should never fail. The same has been exemplified in
   Christ, who, from contempt, ignominy, death, the grave, and despair,
   was raised up by his Father to the sovereignty of heaven, to sit at the
   Father's right hand for ever, and at length to be the judge of the
   world.

   5. His glory is great. By these words the people intimate that their
   king, through the protection which God afforded him, and the
   deliverances which he wrought for him, would become more renowned than
   if he had reigned in peace with the applause of all men, or had been
   defended by human wealth and human strength, or, finally, had continued
   invincible by his own power and policy; for thereby it appeared the
   more clearly that he had only attained to the royal dignity by the
   favor, conduct, and commandment of God. The believing Israelites,
   therefore, leave it to heathen kings to ennoble themselves by their own
   achievements, and to acquire fame by their own valor; and they set more
   value upon this, that God graciously showed himself favorable towards
   their king, [483] than upon all the triumphs of the world. At the same
   time, they promise themselves such assistance from God as will suffice
   for adorning the king with majesty and honor.

   6. For thou hast set him to be blessings for ever. Some explain these
   words simply thus, That God had chosen David to be king, in order to
   pour upon him his blessings in rich abundance. But it is evident that
   something more is intended by this manner of speaking. It implies, that
   the king had such an exuberant abundance of all good things, that he
   might justly be regarded as a pattern of the greatness of the divine
   beneficence; or that, in praying, his name would be generally used to
   serve as an example of how the suppliant wished to be dealt with. The
   Jews were accustomed to speak of those being set to be a curse, who
   were rendered so detestable, and on whom the dreadful vengeance of God
   had been inflicted with such severity, that their very names served for
   cursing and direful imprecations. On the other hand, they were
   accustomed to speak of those being set to be a blessing, whose names we
   propose in our prayers as an example of how we desire to be blessed; as
   if a man for instance should say, May God graciously bestow upon thee
   the same favor which he vouchsafed to his servant David! I do not
   reject this interpretation, but I am satisfied with the other, which
   views the words as implying that the king, abounding in all kind of
   good things, was an illustrious pattern of the liberality of God. We
   must carefully mark what is said immediately after concerning joy: Thou
   hast gladdened him with joy before thy countenance [484] The people not
   only mean that God did good to the king, seeing he looked upon him with
   a benignant and fatherly eye, but they also point out the proper cause
   of this joy, telling us that it proceeded from the knowledge which the
   king had of his being the object of the Divine favor. It would not be
   enough for God to take care of us, and to provide for our necessities,
   unless, on the other hand, he irradiated us with the light of his
   gracious and reconciled countenance, and made us to taste of his
   goodness, as we have seen in the 4th Psalm, "There be many that say,
   Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy
   countenance upon us, and we shall be saved." And without all doubt, it
   is true and solid happiness to experience that God is so favorable to
   us that we dwell as it were in his presence.

   Psalm 21:7-10

   7. For the king trusteth in Jehovah, and through the goodness of the
   Most High, he shall not be moved. 8. Thy hand shall find out all thy
   enemies, thy right hand shalt find out those that hate thee. 9. Thou
   shalt put them as it were into a furnace of fire, in the time of thy
   anger; Jehovah [485] in his wrath shall overwhelm them, and the fire
   shall consume them. 10. Thou wilt destroy their fruit from the earth,
   and their seed from among the children of men.


   7. For the king trusteth. Here again the pious Israelites glory that
   their king shall be established, because he relies upon God; and they
   express at the same time how he relies upon him, namely, by hope or
   trust. I read the whole verse as one sentence, so that there is but one
   principal verb, and explain it thus:- The king, as he places by faith
   his dependence on God and his goodness, will not be subject to the
   disasters which overthrow the kingdoms of this world. Moreover, as we
   have said before, that whatever blessings the faithful attribute to
   their king, belong to the whole body of the Church, there is here made
   a promise, common to all the people of God, which may serve to keep us
   tranquil amidst the various storms which agitate the world. The world
   turns round as it were upon a wheel, by which it comes to pass, that
   those who were raised to the very top are precipitated to the bottom in
   a moment; but it is here promised, that the kingdom of Judah, and the
   kingdom of Christ of which it was a type, will be exempted from such
   vicissitude. Let us remember, that those only have the firmness and
   stability here promised, who betake themselves to the bosom of God by
   an assured faith, and relying upon his mercy, commit themselves to his
   protection. The cause or the ground of this hope or trust is at the
   same time expressed, and it is this, that God mercifully cherishes his
   own people, whom he has once graciously received into his favor.

   8. Thy hand shall find. Hitherto the internal happiness of the kingdom
   has been described. Now there follows, as it was necessary there
   should, the celebration of its invincible strength against its enemies.
   What is said in this verse is of the same import as if the king had
   been pronounced victorious over all his enemies. I have just now
   remarked, that such a statement is not superfluous; for it would not
   have been enough for the kingdom to have flourished internally, and to
   have been replenished with peace, riches, and abundance of all good
   things, had it not also been well fortified against the attacks of
   foreign enemies. This particularly applies to the kingdom of Christ,
   which is never without enemies in this world. True, it is not always
   assailed by open war, and there is sometimes granted to it a period of
   respite; but the ministers of Satan never lay aside their malice and
   desire to do mischief, and therefore they never cease to plot and to
   endeavor to accomplish the overthrow of Christ's kingdom. It is well
   for us that our King, who lifts up his hand as a shield before us to
   defend us, is stronger than all. As the Hebrew word mts', matsa, which
   is twice repeated, and which we have translated, to find, sometimes
   signifies to suffice; and, as in the first clause, there is prefixed to
   the word kl, kal, which signifies all, the letter l, lamed, which
   signifies for, or against, and which is not prefixed to the Hebrew word
   which is rendered those that hate thee; some expositors, because of
   this diversity, explain the verse as if it had been said, Thy hand
   shall be able for all thine enemies, thy right hand shall find out
   those that hate thee. Thus the sentence will ascend by degrees, -- Thy
   hand shall be able to withstand, thy right hand shall lay hold upon thy
   enemies, so that they shall not escape destruction.

   9. Thou shalt put them as it were into a furnace of fire. [486] The
   Psalmist here describes a dreadful kind of vengeance, from which we
   gather, that he does not speak of every kind of enemies in general, but
   of the malicious and frantic despisers of God, who, after the manner of
   the giants [487] of old, rise up against his only begotten Son. The
   very severity of the punishment shows the greatness of the wickedness.
   Some think that David alludes to the kind of punishment which he
   inflicted upon the Ammonites, of which we have an account in the sacred
   history; but it is more probable that he here sets forth metaphorically
   the dreadful destruction which awaits all the adversaries of Christ.
   They may burn with rage against the Church, and set the world on fire
   by their cruelty, but when their wickedness shall have reached its
   highest pitch, there is this reward which God has in reserve for them,
   that he will cast them into his burning furnace to consume them. In the
   first clause, the king is called an avenger; in the second, this office
   is transferred to God; and in the third, the execution of the vengeance
   is attributed to fire; which three things very well agree. We know that
   judgment has been committed to Christ, that he may cast his enemies
   headlong into everlasting fire; but, it was of importance distinctly to
   express that this is not the judgment of man but of God. Nor was it
   less important to set forth how extreme and dreadful a kind of
   vengeance this is, in order to arouse from their torpor those who,
   unapprehensive of danger, boldly despise all the threatenings of God.
   Besides, this serves not a little for the consolation of the righteous.
   We know how dreadful the cruelty of the ungodly is, and that our faith
   would soon sink under it, if it did not rise to the contemplation of
   the judgment of God. The expression, In the time of thy wrath,
   admonishes us that we ought patiently to bear the cross as long as it
   shall please the Lord to exercise and humble us under it. If,
   therefore, he does not immediately put forth his power to destroy the
   ungodly, let us learn to extend our hope to the time which our heavenly
   Father has appointed in his eternal purpose for the execution of his
   judgment, and when our King, armed with his terrible power, will come
   forth to execute vengeance. While he now seems to take no notice, this
   does not imply that he has forgotten either himself or us. On the
   contrary, he laughs at the madness of those who go on in the commission
   of every kind of sin without any fear of danger, and become more
   presumptuous day after day. This laughter of God, it is true, brings
   little comfort to us; but we must, nevertheless, complete the time of
   our condition of warfare till "the day of the Lord's vengeance" come,
   which, as Isaiah declares, (Isaiah 34:8) shall also be "the year of our
   redemption." It does not seem to me to be out of place to suppose, that
   in the last clause, there is denounced against the enemies of Christ a
   destruction like that which God in old time sent upon Sodom and
   Gomorrah. That punishment was a striking and memorable example above
   all others of the judgment of God against all the wicked, or rather it
   was, as it were, a visible image upon earth of the eternal fire of hell
   which is prepared for the reprobate: and hence this similitude is
   frequently to be met with in the sacred writings.

   10. Thou shalt destroy their fruit from the earth. David amplifies the
   greatness of God's wrath, from the circumstance that it shall extend
   even to the children of the wicked. It is a doctrine common enough in
   Scripture, that God not only inflicts punishment upon the first
   originators of wickedness, but makes it even to overflow into the bosom
   of their children. [488] And yet when he thus pursues his vengeance to
   the third and fourth generation, he cannot be said indiscriminately to
   involve the innocent with the guilty. As the seed of the ungodly, whom
   he has deprived of his grace, are accursed, and as all are by nature
   children of wrath, devoted to everlasting destruction, he is no less
   just in exercising his severity towards the children than towards the
   fathers. Who can lay any thing to his charge, if he withhold from those
   who are unworthy of it the grace which he communicates to his own
   children? In both ways he shows how dear and precious to him is the
   kingdom of Christ; first, in extending his mercy to the children of the
   righteous even to a thousand generations; and, secondly, in causing his
   wrath to rest upon the reprobate, even to the third and fourth
   generation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [485] This is rendered according to the pointing in the French version.
   According to the pointing in the Latin version, Jehovah is joined to
   the preceding clause thus: -- "In the time of thy anger, O Jehovah!"

   [486] French and Skinner's translation of these words is the same, and
   so also is that of Rogers. This last author observes, "The common
   interpretation, Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven, etc., is not
   very intelligible. I consider ktvr as put by ellipsis for kvtnvr Thou
   shalt place them as it were [in] a furnace of fire." -- (Rogers' Book
   of Psalms, in Hebrew, metrically arranged, vol. 2, p. 178.) Poole takes
   the same view. Calvin, however, in his French version, gives a
   translation much the same as that of our English version: "Tu les
   rendras comme une fournaise de feu en temps de ta cholere." "Thou shalt
   make them like a furnace of fire, in the time of thy anger." This is
   exactly the rendering of Horsley, in which he is followed by Walford.
   "It describes," says the learned prelate, "the smoke of the Messiah's
   enemies perishing by fire, ascending like the smoke of a furnace. The
   smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever and ever.'" "How awfully
   grand," says Bishop Mant, "is that description of the ruins of the
   cities of the plain, as the prospect struck on Abraham's eye on the
   fatal morning of their destruction:'And he looked toward Sodom and
   Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo! the
   smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.'"

   [487] The allusion is to the fabulous giants of heathen mythology, who
   waged war against heaven.

   Psalm 21:11-13

   11. For they have spread out [489] evil against thee; they have devised
   a stratagem against thee, which they could not accomplish. 12. For
   [490] thou wilt set them as a butt; thou wilt prepare thy bowstrings to
   shoot against their faces. 13. Raise thyself, O Jehovah! In thy
   strength; then we will sing, and celebrate in psalms thy power.


   11. For they have spread out. In this verse David shows that the
   ungodly had deserved the awful ruin which he predicted would befall
   them, since they had not only molested mortal man, but had also rushed
   forth in the fury of their pride to make war against God himself. No
   man, as has been stated in our exposition of the second psalm, could
   offer violence to the kingdom of Israel, which was consecrated in the
   person of David, by the commandment of God, without making foul and
   impious war against God. Much more when persons directly attack the
   kingdom of Christ to overthrow it, is the majesty of God violated,
   since it is the will of God to reign in the world only by the hand of
   his Son. As the Hebrew word nth, natah, which we have translated to
   spread out, also sometimes signifies to turn aside, it may not
   unsuitably be here rendered either way. According to the first view the
   meaning is, that the wicked, as if they had spread out their nets,
   endeavored to subject to themselves the power of God. According to the
   second the meaning is, that for the purpose of hindering, and as it
   were swallowing up his power, [491] they turned aside their malice, so
   as to make it bear against it, just like a man who, having dug a great
   ditch, turned aside the course of some torrent to make it fall within
   it. The Psalmist next declares, that they devised a stratagem, or
   device, which would fail of its accomplishment. By these words he
   rebukes the foolish arrogance of those who, by making war against God,
   manifest a recklessness and an audacity which will undertake any thing,
   however daring.

   12. For thou wilt set them as a butt. As the Hebrew word skm, shekem,
   which we have rendered a butt, properly signifies a shoulder, some
   understand it in that sense here, and explain the sentence thus: Their
   heads shall be smitten with heavy blows, so that having their bodies
   bended, their shoulders shall appear sticking out. According to these
   interpreters, the subjugation of the enemies of God is here
   metaphorically pointed out. But there is another explanation which is
   more generally received even among the Jewish expositors, namely, that
   God will shut them up in some corner, and there keep them from doing
   mischief; [492] and they take this view, because the Hebrew word skm,
   shekem, is often used to denote a corner, quarter, or place. As,
   however, the sacred writer, in the clause immediately following,
   represents God as furnished with a bow, ready to shoot his arrows
   directly in their faces, I have no doubt that, continuing his metaphor,
   he compares them to a butt, or mound of earth, on which it is customary
   to plant the mark which is aimed at, and thus the sense will flow very
   naturally thus: Lord, thou wilt make them as it were a butt against
   which to shoot thine arrows. [493] The great object which the Psalmist
   has in view is doubtless to teach us to exercise patience, until God,
   at the fit time, bring the ungodly to their end.

   13. Raise thyself, O Jehovah! The psalm is at length concluded with a
   prayer, which again confirms that the kingdom which is spoken of is so
   connected with the glory of God, that his power is reflected from it.
   This was no doubt true with respect to the kingdom of David; for God in
   old time displayed his power in exalting him to the throne. But what is
   here stated was only fully accomplished in Christ, who was appointed by
   the heavenly Father to be King over us, and who is at the same time God
   manifest in the flesh. As his divine power ought justly to strike
   terror into the wicked, so it is described as full of the sweetest
   consolation to us, which ought to inspire us with joy, and incite us to
   celebrate it with songs of praise and thanksgivings.

   PSALM 22.

   David complains in this psalm, that he is reduced to such circumstances
   of distress that he is like a man in despair. But after having
   recounted the calamities with which he was so severely afflicted, he
   emerges from the abyss of temptations, and gathering courage, comforts
   himself with the assurance of deliverance. At the same time, he sets
   before us, in his own person, a type of Christ, who he knew by the
   Spirit of prophecy behoved to be abased in marvellous and unusual ways
   [494] previous to his exaltation by the Father. Thus the psalm, in the
   two parts of which it consists, explains that prophecy of Isaiah,
   (Isaiah 53:8,) "He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who
   shall declare his generation?"

   To the chief musician. Upon the hind of the morning. A psalm of David.

   This inscription is obscure; but interpreters have needlessly perplexed
   themselves in seeking after I know not what sublime mystery in a matter
   of small importance. Some are of opinion that the word 'ylt, ayeleth,
   means the morning star; [495] others that it denotes strength [496] but
   it is more correctly rendered hind. As it is evident, from the
   testimony of the apostles, that this psalm is a prophecy concerning
   Christ, the ancient interpreters thought that Christ would not be
   sufficiently dignified and honored unless, putting a mystical or
   allegorical sense upon the word hind, they viewed it as pointing out
   the various things which are included in a sacrifice. Those, also, who
   prefer translating the original words, 'ylt hschr, ayeleth hashachar,
   the dawn of the day or morning, [497] have endeavored to do the same
   thing. But as I find no solidity in these subtleties, it will be better
   to take that view of the title which is more simple and natural. I
   think it highly probable that it was the beginning of some common song;
   nor do I see how the inscription bears any relation to the
   subject-matter of the psalm. From the tenor of the whole composition,
   it appears that David does not here refer merely to one persecution,
   but comprehends all the persecutions which he suffered under Saul. It
   is, however, uncertain whether he composed this psalm when he peaceably
   enjoyed his kingdom, or in the time of his affliction; but there is no
   doubt that he here describes the thoughts which passed through his mind
   in the midst of his troubles, perplexities, and sorrows.

   Psalm 22:1-2

   1. My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou far from my
   help, and from the words of my roaring? 2. O my God! I cry in the
   day-time, [498] but thou hearest not: and in the night-season, and
   there is no silence to me.


   1. My God! The first verse contains two remarkable sentences, which,
   although apparently contrary to each other, are yet ever entering into
   the minds of the godly together. When the Psalmist speaks of being
   forsaken and cast off by God, it seems to be the complaint of a man in
   despair; for can a man have a single spark of faith remaining in him,
   when he believes that there is no longer any succor for him in God? And
   yet, in calling God twice his own God, and depositing his groanings
   into his bosom, he makes a very distinct confession of his faith. With
   this inward conflict the godly must necessarily be exercised whenever
   God withdraws from them the tokens of his favor, so that, in whatever
   direction they turn their eyes, they see nothing but the darkness of
   night. I say, that the people of God, in wrestling with themselves, on
   the one hand discover the weakness of the flesh, and on the other give
   evidence of their faith. With respect to the reprobate, as they cherish
   in their hearts their distrust of God, their perplexity of mind
   overwhelms them, and thus totally incapacitates them for aspiring after
   the grace of God by faith. That David sustained the assaults of
   temptation, without being overwhelmed, or swallowed up by it, may be
   easily gathered from his words. He was greatly oppressed with sorrow,
   but notwithstanding this, he breaks forth into the language of
   assurance, My God! my God! which he could not have done without
   vigorously resisting the contrary apprehension [499] that God had
   forsaken him. There is not one of the godly who does not daily
   experience in himself the same thing. According to the judgment of the
   flesh, he thinks he is cast off and forsaken by God, while yet he
   apprehends by faith the grace of God, which is hidden from the eye of
   sense and reason; and thus it comes to pass, that contrary affections
   are mingled and interwoven in the prayers of the faithful. Carnal sense
   and reason cannot but conceive of God as being either favorable or
   hostile, according to the present condition of things which is
   presented to their view. When, therefore, he suffers us to lie long in
   sorrow, and as it were to pine away under it, we must necessarily feel,
   according to the apprehension of the flesh, as if he had quite
   forgotten us. When such a perplexing thought takes entire possession of
   the mind of man, it overwhelms him in profound unbelief, and he neither
   seeks, nor any longer expects, to find a remedy. But if faith come to
   his aid against such a temptation, the same person who, judging from
   the outward appearance of things, regarded God as incensed against him,
   or as having abandoned him, beholds in the mirror of the promises the
   grace of God which is hidden and distant. Between these two contrary
   affections the faithful are agitated, and, as it were, fluctuate, when
   Satan, on the one hand, by exhibiting to their view the signs of the
   wrath of God, urges them on to despair, and endeavors entirely to
   overthrow their faith; while faith, on the other hand, by calling them
   back to the promises, teaches them to wait patiently and to trust in
   God, until he again show them his fatherly countenance.

   We see then the source from which proceeded this exclamation, My God!
   my God! and from which also proceeded the complaint which follows
   immediately after, Why hast thou forsaken me? Whilst the vehemence of
   grief, and the infirmity of the flesh, forced from the Psalmist these
   words, I am forsaken of God; faith, lest he should when so severely
   tried sink into despair, put into his mouth a correction of this
   language, so that he boldly called God, of whom he thought he was
   forsaken, his God. Yea, we see that he has given the first place to
   faith. Before he allows himself to utter his complaint, in order to
   give faith the chief place, he first declares that he still claimed God
   as his own God, and betook himself to him for refuge. And as the
   affections of the flesh, when once they break forth, are not easily
   restrained, but rather carry us beyond the bounds of reason, it is
   surely well to repress them at the very commencement. David, therefore,
   observed the best possible order in giving his faith the precedency -
   in expressing it before giving vent to his sorrow, and in qualifying,
   by devout prayer, the complaint which he afterwards makes with respect
   to the greatness of his calamities. Had he spoken simply and precisely
   in these terms, Lord, why forsakest thou me? he would have seemed, by a
   complaint so bitter, to murmur against God; and besides, his mind would
   have been in great danger of being embittered with discontent through
   the greatness of his grief. But, by here raising up against murmuring
   and discontent the rampart of faith, he keeps all his thoughts and
   feelings under restraint, that they may not break beyond due bounds.
   Nor is the repetition superfluous when he twice calls God his God; and,
   a little after, he even repeats the same words the third time. When
   God, as if he had cast off all care about us, passes over our miseries
   and groanings as if he saw them not, the conflict with this species of
   temptation is arduous and painful, and therefore David the more
   strenuously exerts himself in seeking the confirmation of his faith.
   Faith does not gain the victory at the first encounter, but after
   receiving many blows, and after being exercised with many tossings, she
   at length comes forth victorious. I do not say that David was so
   courageous and valiant a champion as that his faith did not waver. The
   faithful may put forth all their efforts to subdue their carnal
   affections, that they may subject and devote themselves wholly to God;
   but still there is always some infirmity remaining in them. From this
   proceeded that halting of holy Jacob, of which Moses makes mention in
   Genesis 32:24; for although in wrestling with God he prevailed, yet he
   ever after bore the mark of his sinful defect. By such examples God
   encourages his servants to perseverance, lest, from a consciousness of
   their own infirmity, they should sink into despair. The means therefore
   which we ought to adopt, whenever our flesh becomes tumultuous, and,
   like an impetuous tempest, hurries us into impatience, is to strive
   against it, and to endeavor to restrain its impetuosity. In doing this
   we will, it is true, be agitated and sorely tried, but our faith will,
   nevertheless, continue safe, and be preserved from shipwreck. Farther,
   we may gather from the very form of the complaint which David here
   makes, that he did not without cause redouble the words by which his
   faith might be sustained. He does not simply say that he was forsaken
   by God, but he adds, that God was far from his help, in as-much as when
   he saw him in the greatest danger, he gave him no token to encourage
   him in the hope of obtaining deliverance. Since God has the ability to
   succor us, if, when he sees us exposed as a prey to our enemies, he
   nevertheless sits still as if he cared not about us, who would not say
   that he has drawn back his hand that he may not deliver us? Again, by
   the expression, the words of my roaring, the Psalmist intimates that he
   was distressed and tormented in the highest degree. He certainly was
   not a man of so little courage as, on account of some slight or
   ordinary affliction, to howl in this manner like a brute beast. [500]
   We must therefore come to the conclusion, that the distress was very
   great which could extort such roaring from a man who was distinguished
   for meekness, and for the undaunted courage with which he endured
   calamities.

   As our Savior Jesus Christ, when hanging on the cross, and when ready
   to yield up his soul into the hands of God his Father, made use of
   these very words, (Matthew 27:46,) we must consider how these two
   things can agree, that Christ was the only begotten Son of God, and
   that yet he was so penetrated with grief, seized with so great mental
   trouble, as to cry out that God his Father had forsaken him. The
   apparent contradiction between these two statements has constrained
   many interpreters to have recourse to evasions for fear of charging
   Christ with blame in this matter. [501] Accordingly, they have said
   that Christ made this complaint rather according to the opinion of the
   common people, who witnessed his sufferings, than from any feeling
   which he had of being deserted by his father. But they have not
   considered that they greatly lessen the benefit of our redemption, in
   imagining that Christ was altogether exempted from the terrors which
   the judgment of God strikes into sinners. It was a groundless fear to
   be afraid of making Christ subject to so great sorrow, lest they should
   diminish his glory. As Peter, in Acts 2:24, clearly testifies that "it
   was not possible that he should be holden of the pains of death," it
   follows that he was not altogether exempted from them. And as he became
   our representative, and took upon him our sins, it was certainly
   necessary that he should appear before the judgment-seat of God as a
   sinner. From this proceeded the terror and dread which constrained him
   to pray for deliverance from death; not that it was so grievous to him
   merely to depart from this life; but because there was before his eyes
   the curse of God, to which all who are sinners are exposed. Now, if
   during his first conflict "his sweat was as it were great drops of
   blood," and he needed an angel to comfort him, (Luke 22:43,) it is not
   wonderful if, in his last sufferings on the cross, he uttered a
   complaint which indicated the deepest sorrow. By the way, it should be
   marked, that Christ, although subject to human passions and affections,
   never fell into sin through the weakness of the flesh; for the
   perfection of his nature preserved him from all excess. He could
   therefore overcome all the temptations with which Satan assailed him,
   without receiving any wound in the conflict which might afterwards
   constrain him to halt. In short, there is no doubt that Christ, in
   uttering this exclamation upon the cross, manifestly showed, that
   although David here bewails his own distresses, this psalm was composed
   under the influence of the Spirit of prophecy concerning David's King
   and Lord.

   2. O my God! I cry in the day-time. In this verse the Psalmist
   expresses the long continuance of his affliction, which increased his
   disquietude and weariness. It was a temptation even still more
   grievous, that his crying seemed only to be lost labor; for, as our
   only means of relief under our calamities is in calling upon God, if we
   derive no advantage from our prayers, what other remedy remains for us?
   David, therefore, complains that God is in a manner deaf to his
   prayers. When he says in the second clause, And there is no silence to
   me, the meaning is, that he experienced no comfort or solace, nothing
   which could impart tranquillity to his troubled mind. As long as
   affliction pressed upon him, his mind was so disquieted, that he was
   constrained to cry out. Here there is shown the constancy of faith, in
   that the long duration of calamities could neither overthrow it, nor
   interrupt its exercise. The true rule of praying is, therefore, this,
   that he who seems to have beaten the air to no purpose, or to have lost
   his labor in praying for a long time, should not, on that account,
   leave off, or desist from that duty. Meanwhile, there is this advantage
   which God in his fatherly kindness grants to his people, that if they
   have been disappointed at any time of their desires and expectations,
   they may make known to God their perplexities and distresses, and
   unburden them, as it were, into his bosom.

   Psalm 22:3-8

   3. Yet thou art holy, who inhabitest the praises of Israel. 4. Our
   fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 5.
   They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and
   were not confounded. 6. But I am a worm, and not a man; the scorn of
   men, and the contempt of the people. 7. All those who see me mock at
   me: they thrust out the lip, and shake the head. 8. "He has committed,"
   say they, "his cause unto [or, devolved his cause upon] Jehovah: [502]
   let him deliver him, let him deliver him, [503] seeing he delights in
   him."


   3. Yet thou art holy. In the Hebrew, it is properly, And thou art holy:
   but the copula v, vau, ought, without doubt, to be rendered by the
   adversative particle yet. Some think that the eternal and immutable
   state of God is here set in opposition to the afflictions which David
   experienced; [504] but I cannot subscribe to this opinion. It is more
   simple and natural to view the language as meaning, that God has always
   shown himself gracious to his chosen people. The subject here treated
   is not what God is in heaven, but what he has shown himself to be
   towards men. It may be asked, whether David, in these words, aggravates
   his complaint, by insinuating that he is the only person who obtains
   nothing from God? or whether, by holding up these words as a shield
   before him, he repels the temptation with which he was assailed, by
   exhibiting to his view this truth, that God is the continual deliverer
   of his people? I admit that this verse is an additional expression of
   the greatness of David's grief; but I have no doubt, that in using this
   language he seeks from it a remedy against his distrust. It was a
   dangerous temptation to see himself forsaken by God; and, accordingly,
   lest by continually thinking upon it, he should nourish it, he turned
   his mind to the contemplation of the constant evidences afforded of the
   grace of God, from which he might encourage himself, in the hope of
   obtaining succor. He, therefore, not only meant to ask how it was that
   God, who had always dealt mercifully with his people, should now,
   forgetting as it were his own nature, thus leave a miserable man
   without any succor or solace; but he also takes a shield with which to
   defend himself against the fiery darts of Satan. He calls God holy,
   because he continues always like himself. He says that he inhabiteth
   the praises of Israel; because, in showing such liberality towards the
   chosen people, as to be continually bestowing blessings upon them, he
   furnished them with matter for continued praise and thanksgiving.
   Unless God cause us to taste of his goodness by doing us good, we must
   needs become mute in regard to the celebration of his praise. As David
   belonged to the number of this chosen people, he strives, in opposition
   to all the obstacles which distrust might suggest as standing in the
   way, to cherish the hope that he shall at length be united to this body
   to sing along with them the praises of God.

   4. Our fathers trusted in thee. Here the Psalmist assigns the reason
   why God sitteth amidst the praises of the tribes of Israel. The reason
   is, because his hand had been always stretched forth to preserve his
   faithful people. David, as I have just now observed, gathers together
   the examples of all past ages, in order thereby to encourage,
   strengthen, and effectually persuade himself, that as God had never
   cast off any of his chosen people, he also would be one of the number
   of those for whom deliverance is securely laid up in the hand of God.
   He therefore expressly declares that he belongs to the offspring of
   those who had been heard, intimating by this, that he is an heir of the
   same grace which they had experienced. He has an eye to the covenant by
   which God had adopted the posterity of Abraham to be his peculiar
   people. It would be of little consequence to know the varied instances
   in which God has exercised his mercy towards his own people, unless
   each of us could reckon himself among their number, as David includes
   himself in the Church of God. In repeating three times that the fathers
   had obtained deliverance by trusting, there is no doubt that with all
   modesty he intends tacitly to intimate that he had the same hope with
   which they were inspired, a hope which draws after it, as its effect,
   the fulfillment of the promises in our behalf. In order that a man may
   derive encouragement from the blessings which God has bestowed upon his
   servants in former times, he should turn his attention to the free
   promises of God's word, and to the faith which leans upon them. In
   short, to show that this confidence was neither cold nor dead, David
   tells us, at the same time, that they cried unto God. He who pretends
   that he trusts in God, and yet is so listless and indifferent under his
   calamities that he does not implore his aid, lies shamefully. By
   prayer, then, true faith is known, as the goodness of a tree is known
   by its fruit. It ought also to be observed, that God regards no other
   prayers as right but those which proceed from faith, and are
   accompanied with it. It is therefore not without good reason that David
   has put the word cried in the middle between these words, They trusted
   in thee, they trusted, in the fourth verse, and these words, They
   trusted in thee, in the fifth verse.

   6. But I am a worm, and not a man. David does not murmur against God as
   if God had dealt hardly with him; but in bewailing his condition, he
   says, in order the more effectually to induce God to show him mercy,
   that he is not accounted so much as a man. This, it is true, seems at
   first sight to have a tendency to discourage the mind, or rather to
   destroy faith; but it will appear more clearly from the sequel, that so
   far from this being the case, David declares how miserable his
   condition is, that by this means he may encourage himself in the hope
   of obtaining relief. He therefore argues that it could not be but that
   God would at length stretch forth his hand to save him; to save him, I
   say, who was so severely afflicted, and on the brink of despair. If God
   has had compassion on all who have ever been afflicted, although
   afflicted only in a moderate degree, how could he forsake his servant
   when plunged in the lowest abyss of all calamities? Whenever,
   therefore, we are overwhelmed under a great weight of afflictions, we
   ought rather to take from this an argument to encourage us to hope for
   deliverance, than suffer ourselves to fall into despair. If God so
   severely exercised his most eminent servant David, and abased him so
   far that he had not a place even among the most despised of men, let us
   not take it ill, if, after his example, we are brought low. We ought,
   however, principally to call to our remembrance the Son of God, in
   whose person we know this also was fulfilled, as Isaiah had predicted,

   "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised,
   and we esteemed him not." (Isaiah 53:3)

   By these words of the prophet we are furnished with a sufficient
   refutation of the frivolous subtlety of those who have philosophised
   upon the word worm, as if David here pointed out some singular mystery
   in the generation of Christ; whereas his meaning simply is, that he had
   been abased beneath all men, and, as it were, cut off from the number
   of living beings. The fact that the Son of God suffered himself to be
   reduced to such ignominy, yea, descended even to hell, is so far from
   obscuring, in any respect, his celestial glory, that it is rather a
   bright mirror from which is reflected his unparalleled grace towards
   us.

   7. All those who see me mock at me, etc., [505] This is an explanation
   of the preceding sentence. He had said that he was an object of scorn
   to the lowest of men, and, as it were, to the refuse of the people. He
   now informs us of the ignominy with which he had been treated, -- that
   not content with opprobrious language, they also showed their insolence
   by their very gesture, both by shooting out their lips, [506] and by
   shaking their heads. As the words which we render they thrust out the
   lip, is, in the Hebrew, they open with the lip, [507] some explain them
   as meaning to rail. But this view does not appear to me to be
   appropriate; for the letter v, beth, which signifies with, is here
   superfluous, as it often is in the Hebrew. I have therefore preferred
   rendering the original words, they thrust out the lip; which is the
   gesture of those who mock openly and injuriously. The reproachful
   language which follows was much more grievous when they alleged against
   him that God, who he openly avowed was his father, was turned away from
   him. We know that David, when he saw himself unjustly condemned of the
   world, was accustomed to support and console himself with the
   assurance, that since he had the approving testimony of a good
   conscience, he had God in heaven for his guardian, who was able to
   execute vengeance upon his revilers. [508] But now, all who saw him
   reproached him, that with vain arrogance he had groundlessly boasted of
   the succor he would receive from God. Where is that God, say they, on
   whom he leaned? Where is that love to which he trusted? Satan has not a
   more deadly dart for wounding the souls of men than when he endeavors
   to dislodge hope from our minds, by turning the promises of God into
   ridicule. David's enemies, however, do not simply say that his prayers
   were in vain, and that the love of God of which he boasted was
   fallacious; but they indirectly charge him with being a hypocrite, in
   that he falsely pretended to be one of the children of God, from whom
   he was altogether estranged.

   How severe a temptation this must have been to David every man may
   judge from his own experience. But by the remedy he used he afforded a
   proof of the sincerity of his confidence: for unless he had had God as
   the undoubted witness and approver of the sincerity of his heart, he
   would never have dared to come before him with this complaint.
   Whenever, therefore, men charge us with hypocrisy, let it be our
   endeavor that the inward sincerity of our hearts may answer for us
   before God. And whenever Satan attempts to dislodge faith from our
   minds, by biting detraction and cruel derision, let this be our sacred
   anchors -- to call upon God to witness it, and that, beholding it, he
   may be pleased to show his righteousness in maintaining our right,
   since his holy name cannot be branded with viler blasphemy than to say
   that those who put their trust in him are puffed up with vain
   confidence, and that those who persuade themselves that God loves them
   deceive themselves with a groundless fancy. As the Son of God was
   assailed with the same weapon, it is certain that Satan will not be
   more sparing of true believers who are his members than of him. They
   ought, therefore, to defend themselves from this consideration - that
   although men may regard them as in a desperate condition, yet, if they
   commit to God both themselves and all their affairs, their prayers will
   not be in vain. By the verb, gl, gol, which is rendered to commit, the
   nature and efficacy of faith are very well expressed, which, reposing
   itself upon the providence of God, relieves our minds from the burdens
   of the cares and troubles with which they are agitated.

   version our author reads, "Devolvit ad Jehovam;" and in the French, "Il
   a remis disent-ils, au Seigneur son a l'aime."

   [503] "Let him deliver him, let him deliver him. This repetition is
   also the rendering adopted by Street, and it is approved by Poole. "The
   same thing," says Poole, "is twice repeated, to show both the vehemence
   of their hatred and their confidence of success against him."

   [504] As ysv, yashab, not only signifies to inhabit, but also to remain
   or continue, (see Psalm 102:13,) Hammond thinks this last is the
   meaning here, and renders the word, "But thou remainest or continuest
   to be holy, O thou, the praises of, or who art the praises of Israel,
   that is, the object of all their praises; or more simply, But thou
   remainest holy, the praises of Israel."

   [505] Bishop Horsley reads these words, "All who see me insult [me]
   with gestures of derision:" and says, "I can no otherwise render the
   verb lg, than by this periphrasis. Bishop Mant translates the whole
   verse thus, "All who to slaughter see me led,
   Deride my state distrest;
   They curl the lip, they shake the head,
   They point the taunting jest:" And observes, "The distinctness and
   colouring of the prophetic picture here are as striking to the
   imagination, as the subject is painful to the heart."

   strong indication of contempt. Its employment is chiefly confined to
   the lower orders." -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.

   Psalm 22:9-11

   9. Surely thou didst draw me forth from the womb, and thou didst cause
   me to confide upon the breasts of my mother. [509] 10. I was cast upon
   thee [510] from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. 11.
   Depart not far from me, for distress is near, and there is none to help
   me.


   9. Surely thou. David again here raises a new fortress, in order to
   withstand and repel the machinations of Satan. He briefly enumerates
   the benefits which God had bestowed upon him, by which he had long
   since learned that he was his father. Yea, he declares that even before
   he was born God had shown towards him such evidence of his fatherly
   love, that although now overwhelmed with the darkness of death, he
   might upon good ground venture to hope for life from him. And it is the
   Holy Spirit who teaches the faithful the wisdom to collect together,
   when they are brought into circumstances of fear and trouble, the
   evidences of the goodness of God, in order thereby to sustain and
   strengthen their faith. We ought to regard it as an established
   principle, that as God never wearies in the exercise of his liberality,
   and as the most exuberant bestowment cannot exhaust his riches, it
   follows that, as we have experienced him to be a father from our
   earliest infancy, he will show himself the same towards us even to
   extreme old age. In acknowledging that he was taken from the womb by
   the hand of God, and that God had caused him to confide upon the
   breasts of his mother, the meaning is, that although it is by the
   operation of natural causes that infants come into the world, and are
   nourished with their mother's milk, yet therein the wonderful
   providence of God brightly shines forth. This miracle, it is true,
   because of its ordinary occurrence, is made less account of by us. But
   if ingratitude did not put upon our eyes the veil of stupidity, we
   would be ravished with admiration at every childbirth in the world.
   What prevents the child from perishing, as it might, a hundred times in
   its own corruption, before the time for bringing it forth arrives, but
   that God, by his secret and incomprehensible power, keeps it alive in
   its grave? And after it is brought into the world, seeing it is subject
   to so many miseries, and cannot stir a finger to help itself, how could
   it live even for a single day, did not God take it up into his fatherly
   bosom to nourish and protect it? It is, therefore, with good reason
   said, that the infant is cast upon him; for, unless he fed the tender
   little babes, and watched over all the offices of the nurse, even at
   the very time of their being brought forth, they are exposed to a
   hundred deaths, by which they would be suffocated in an instant.
   Finally, David concludes that God was his God. God, it is true, to all
   appearance, shows the like goodness which is here celebrated even to
   the brute creation; but it is only to mankind that he shows himself to
   be a father in a special manner. And although he does not immediately
   endue babes with the knowledge of himself, yet he is said to give them
   confidence, because, by showing in fact that he takes care of their
   life, he in a manner allures them to himself; as it is said in another
   place,

   "He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry,"
   (Psalm 147:9.)

   Since God anticipates in this manner, by his grace, little infants
   before they have as yet the use of reason, it is certain that he will
   never disappoint the hope of his servants when they petition and call
   upon him. This is the argument by which David struggled with, and
   endeavored to overcome temptation.

   11. Depart not far from me. Here he employs another argument to induce
   God to show him mercy, alleging that he is sorely pressed and hemmed in
   by the greatest distress. He doubtless set before his eyes the office
   which the Scriptures every where attribute to God of succouring the
   miserable, and of being the more ready to help us the more we are
   afflicted. Even despair itself, therefore, served as a ladder to
   elevate his mind to the exercise of devout and fervent prayer. In like
   manner, the feeling we have of our afflictions should excite us to take
   shelter under the wings of God, that by granting us his aid, he may
   show that he takes a deep interest in our welfare.

   Psalm 22:12-16

   12. Strong bulls have encompassed me; the bulls of Bashan have beset me
   round. 13. They have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and a
   roaring lion. 14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are
   disjointed: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my
   bowels. 15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue
   cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me to the dust of death. 16.
   For dogs have encompassed me; the assembly of the wicked have
   surrounded me: they have pierced my hands and my feet.


   12. Strong bulls have encompassed me. The Psalmist now complains of the
   cruelty and barbarous rage of his enemies; and he compares them first
   to bulls, secondly to lions, and thirdly to dogs. When the anger of
   bulls is kindled, we know how fierce and terrible they are. The lion,
   also, is a cruel beast, and dreadful to mankind. And the eager and
   fierce boldness with which dogs, when once they are irritated, rush
   upon a man to do him injury, is well known. In short, David's enemies
   were so blood-thirsty and cruel, that they more resembled wild beasts
   than men. He calls them not simply bulls, but strong bulls. Instead of
   rendering the original word rvym, rabbim, strong, as we have done, some
   would render it many: with which I cannot agree. David, it is true, was
   assailed by great hosts of enemies; but it appears, from the second
   clause of the verse, that what is here described is their strength, and
   not their number. He there terms them the bulls of Bashan; meaning by
   that expression, well-fed bulls, and, consequently, large and strong:
   for we know that the hill of Bashan was distinguished for rich and fat
   pastures. [511]

   14. I am poured out like water. Hitherto he has informed us that being
   surrounded by wild beasts, he was not far from death, as if he had been
   at the point of being devoured every moment. He now bewails, in
   addition to this, his inward distress; from which we learn that he was
   not stupid or insensible in dangers. It could have been no ordinary
   fear which made him almost pine away, by which his bones were
   disjointed, and his heart poured out like water. We see, then, that
   David was not buffeted with the waves of affliction like a rock which
   cannot be moved, but was agitated within by sore troubles and
   temptations, which, through the infirmity of the flesh, he would never
   have been able to sustain had he not been aided by the power of the
   Spirit of God. How these sufferings are applicable to Christ I have
   informed you a little before. Being a real man, he was truly subject to
   the infirmities of our flesh, only without the taint of sin. The
   perfect purity of his nature did not extinguish the human affections;
   it only regulated them, that they might not become sinful through
   excess. The greatness of his griefs, therefore, could not so weaken him
   as to prevent him, even in the midst of his most excruciating
   sufferings, from submitting himself to the will of God, with a composed
   and peaceful mind. Now, although this is not the case with respect to
   us, who have within us turbulent and disorderly affections, and who
   never can keep them under such restraint as not to be driven hither and
   thither by their impetuosity, yet, after the example of David, we ought
   to take courage; and when, through our infirmity, we are, as it were,
   almost lifeless, we should direct our groanings to God, beseeching him
   that he would be graciously pleased to restore us to strength and
   vigor. [512]

   15. My strength is dried up. He means the vigor which is imparted to us
   by the radical moisture, as physicians call it. What he adds in the
   next clause, My tongue cleaveth to my jaws, is of the same import. We
   know that excessive grief not only consumes the vital spirits, but also
   dries up almost all the moisture which is in our bodies. He next
   declares, that in consequence of this, he was adjudged or devoted to
   the grave: Thou hast brought me to the dust of death. By this he
   intimates, that all hope of life was taken from him; and in this sense
   Paul also says, (2 Corinthians 1:9,) that "he had received the sentence
   of death in himself." But David here speaks of himself in hyperbolical
   language, and he does this in order to lead us beyond himself to
   Christ. The dreadful encounter of our Redeemer with death, by which
   there was forced from his body blood instead of sweat; his descent into
   hell, by which he tasted of the wrath of God which was due to sinners;
   and, in short, his emptying himself, could not be adequately expressed
   by any of the ordinary forms of speech. Moreover, David speaks of death
   as those who are in trouble are accustomed to speak of it, who, struck
   with fear, can think of nothing but of their being reduced to dust and
   to destruction. Whenever the minds of the saints are surrounded and
   oppressed with this darkness, there is always some unbelief mixed with
   their exercise, which prevents them from all at once emerging from it
   to the light of a new life. But in Christ these two things were
   wonderfully conjoined, namely, terror, proceeding from a sense of the
   curse of God; and patience, arising from faith, which tranquillised all
   the mental emotions, so that they continued in complete and willing
   subjection to the authority of God. With respect to ourselves, who are
   not endued with the like power, if at any time, upon beholding nothing
   but destruction near us, we are for a season greatly dismayed, we
   should endeavor by degrees to recover courage, and to elevate ourselves
   to the hope which quickens the dead.

   16. They have pierced my hands and my feet. The original word, which we
   have translated they have pierced, is k'ry, caari, which literally
   rendered is, like a lion. As all the Hebrew Bibles at this day, without
   exception, have this reading, I would have had great hesitation in
   departing from a reading which they all support, were it not that the
   scope of the discourse compels me to do so, and were there not strong
   grounds for conjecturing that this passage has been fraudulently
   corrupted by the Jews. With respect to the Septuagint version, there is
   no doubt that the translators had read in the Hebrew text, k'rv, caaru,
   that is the letter v, vau, where there is now the letter y, yod. [513]
   The Jews prate much about the literal sense being purposely and
   deliberately overthrown, by our rendering the original word by they
   have pierced: but for this allegation there is no color of truth
   whatever. What need was there to trifle so presumptuously in a matter
   where it was altogether unnecessary? Very great suspicion of falsehood,
   however, attaches to them, seeing it is the uppermost desire of their
   hearts to despoil the crucified Jesus of his escutcheons, and to divest
   him of his character as the Messiah and Redeemer. If we receive this
   reading as they would have us to do, the sense will be enveloped in
   marvellous obscurity. In the first place, it will be a defective form
   of expression, and to complete it, they say it is necessary to supply
   the verb to surround or to beset. But what do they mean by besetting
   the hands and the feet? Besetting belongs no more to these parts of the
   human body than to the whole man. The absurdity of this argument being
   discovered, they have recourse to the most ridiculous old wives'
   fables, according to their usual way, saying, that the lion, when he
   meets any man in his road, makes a circle with his tail before rushing
   upon his prey: from which it is abundantly evident that they are at a
   loss for arguments to support their view.

   Again, since David, in the preceding verse, has used the similitude of
   a lion, the repetition of it in this verse would be superfluous. I
   forbear insisting upon what some of our expositors have observed,
   namely, that this noun, when it has prefixed to it the letter k, caph,
   which signifies as, the word denoting similitude, has commonly other
   points than those which are employed in this passage. My object,
   however, is not here to labor to convince the Jews who in controversy
   are in the highest degree obstinate and opinionative. I only intend
   briefly to show how wickedly they endeavor to perplex Christians on
   account of the different reading which occurs in this place. When they
   object, that by the appointment of the law no man was fastened with
   nails to a cross, they betray in this their gross ignorance of history,
   since it is certain that the Romans introduced many of their own
   customs and manners into the provin ces which they had conquered. If
   they object that David was never nailed to a cross, the answer is easy,
   namely, that in bewailing his condition, he has made use of a
   similitude, declaring that he was not less afflicted by his enemies
   than the man who is suspended on a cross, having his hands and feet
   pierced through with nails. We will meet a little after with more of
   the same kind of metaphors.

   from its luxuriant pastures, were uncommonly so." -- Dr Geddes.

   [512] "Ace qu'il luy plaise nous remettre sus, et nous rendre force et
   vigueur." -- Fr.

   [513] This word has created much discussion. In the Hebrew Bible, the
   kethib or textual reading is, k'ry, caari, like a lion; the keri, or
   marginal reading, is k'rv, caaru, "they pierced," from krh, carah, to
   cut, dig, or pierce. Both readings are supported by MSS. There is,
   however, no ground to doubt that the genuine reading is, k'rv, caaru.
   As the Septuagint here reads oruxan, they pierced, the translators,
   doubtless, considered that the correct reading of the Hebrew text was
   k'rv, caaru. The Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic, give a similar
   rendering. All the Evangelists also quote and apply the passage to the
   crucifixion of Christ. Besides, the other reading, k'ry, caari, as a
   lion, renders the passage unintelligible. The Chaldee version has
   combined both the ideas of pierced and as a lion, reading, "Biting, as
   a lion, my hands and my feet." Our author supposes that the text has
   been fraudulently corrupted by the Jews, who have intentionally changed
   k'rv, caaru, into k'ry, caari. But there is no necessity for supposing
   that there has been any fraud in the case. In the process of
   transcription, the change might have been made unintentionally, by the
   substitution of the letter y, yod, for the letter v, vau, which it so
   nearly resembles. Walford observes, "that the present reading [k'ry,
   caari] is quite satisfactory, if it be taken as a participle plural in
   reflexive, and be translated, Wounders of my hands and my feet.'"

   Psalm 22:17-21

   17. I will number all my bones; they look and stare upon me. 18. They
   part my garments among them, and cast the lot upon my vesture. 19. Be
   not thou then, O Jehovah! far from me. O thou: who art my strength,
   make haste to help me. 20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one
   [514] from the hand [or power] of the dog. 21. Save me from the mouth
   of the lion, and hear me from the horns of the unicorns. [515]


   17. I will number. The Hebrew word tsmvt, atsmoth which signifies
   bones, is derived from another word, which signifies strength; and,
   therefore, this term is sometimes applied to friends, by whose defense
   we are strengthened, or to arguments and reasons which are, as it were,
   the sinews and the strength of the defense of a cause. Some, therefore,
   put this meaning upon the passage, -- I will profit nothing by
   reckoning up all my arguments in self-vindication; for my enemies are
   fully determined to destroy me by some means or other, whether fair or
   foul, without having any regard to the dictates of justice. Others
   explain it thus: Although I should gather together all the aids which
   might seem to be capable of affording me succor, they would avail me
   nothing. But the exposition which is more generally received seems to
   me to be also the more simple and natural, and, therefore, I embrace it
   the more readily. It is this - that David complains that his body was
   so lean and wasted, that the bones appeared protruding from all parts
   of it; for he adds immediately after, that his enemies took pleasure in
   seeing him in so pitiable a condition. Thus the two clauses of the
   verse are beautifully connected together. The cruelty of his enemies
   was so insatiable, that beholding a wretched man wasted with grief, and
   as it were pining away, they took pleasure in feeding their eyes with
   so sad a spectacle.

   What follows in the next verse concerning his garments is metaphorical.
   It is as if he had said, that all his goods were become a prey to his
   enemies, even as conquerors are accustomed to plunder the vanquished,
   or to divide the spoil among themselves, by casting lots to determine
   the share which belongs to each. Comparing his ornaments, riches, and
   all that he possessed, to his garments, he complains that, after he had
   been despoiled of them, his enemies divided them among themselves, as
   so much booty, accompanied with mockery of him; and by this mockery the
   villany of their conduct was aggravated, inasmuch as they triumphed
   over him, as if he had been a dead man. The Evangelists quote this
   place to the letter, as we say, and without figure; and there is no
   absurdity in their doing so. To teach us the more certainly that in
   this psalm Christ is described to us by the Spirit of prophecy, the
   heavenly Father intended that in the person of his Son those things
   should be visibly accomplished which were shadowed forth in David.
   Matthew, (Matthew 8:16, 17,) in narrating that the paralytic, the
   blind, and the lame, were healed of their diseases, says, that this was
   done "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
   prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bear our
   sicknesses;" although the prophet, in that place, sets before us the
   Son of God in the character of a spiritual physician. We are extremely
   slow and backward to believe; and it is not wonderful, that, on account
   of our dullness of apprehension, a demonstration of the character of
   Christ, palpable to our senses, has been given us, [516] which might
   have the effect of arousing the sluggishness of our understandings.

   19. Be not thou, then, far from me, O Jehovah! We must keep in mind all
   that David has hitherto related concerning himself. As his miseries had
   reached the utmost height, and as he saw not even a single ray of hope
   to encourage him to expect deliverance, it is a wonderful instance of
   the power of faith, that he not only endured his afflictions patiently,
   but that from the abyss of despair he arose to call upon God. Let us,
   therefore, particularly mark, that David did not pour out his
   lamentations thinking them to be in vain, and of no effect, as persons
   who are in perplexity often pour forth their groanings at random. The
   prayers which he adds sufficiently show that he hoped for such an issue
   as he desired. When he calls God his strength, by this epithet he gives
   a more evident proof of his faith. He does not pray in a doubting
   manner; but he promises himself the assistance which the eye of sense
   did not as yet perceive. By the sword, by the hand of the dog, by the
   mouth of the lion, and by the horns of the unicorns, he intimates that
   he was presently exposed to the danger of death, and that in many ways.
   Whence we gather, that although he utterly fainted in himself when thus
   surrounded by death, he yet continued strong in the Lord, and that the
   spirit of life had always been vigorous in his heart. Some take the
   words only soul, or only life, for dear and precious; [517] but this
   view does not appear to me to be appropriate. He rather means, that,
   amidst so many deaths he found no help or succor in the whole world; as
   in Psalm 35:17 the words, only soul, [518] are used in the same sense
   for a person who is alone and destitute of all aid and succor. This
   will appear more clearly from Psalm 25:16, where David, by calling
   himself poor and alone, doubtless complains that he was completely
   deprived of friends, and forsaken of the whole world. When it is said
   in the end of the 21st verse, Answer me, or, Hear me from the horns of
   the unicorns, this Hebrew manner of speaking may seem strange and
   obscure to our ears, but the sense is not at all ambiguous. The cause
   is only put instead of the effect; for our deliverance is the
   consequence or effect of God's hearing us. If it is asked how this can
   be applied to Christ, whom the Father did not deliver from death? I
   answer, in one word, that he was more mightily delivered than if God
   had prevented him from falling a victim to death, even as it is a much
   greater deliverance to rise again from the dead than to be healed of a
   grievous malady. Death, therefore, did not prevent Christ's
   resurrection from at length bearing witness that he had been heard.

   Psalm 22:22-24

   22. I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the
   assembly will I praise thee. 23. [Saying, [519] ] Ye who fear Jehovah,
   praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye
   the seed of Israel. 24. For he hath not despised nor disdained the
   poor; nor hath he hidden his face from him; and when he cried unto him
   he heard him.


   22. I will declare thy name. [520] David, in promising that when he is
   delivered he will not be ungrateful, confirms what I have previously
   stated, that he had never been so cast down by temptation as not to
   take courage to resist it. How could he be putting himself in
   readiness, as he is doing here, to offer to God the sacrifice of
   thanksgiving, if he had not beforehand entertained the assured hope of
   deliverance? Should we even grant that this psalm was composed after
   David had actually obtained what he desired, there is no doubt that
   what he afterwards put into writing formed the meditations and
   reflections which had passed through his mind during the time of his
   heavy afflictions. It ought to be particularly noticed, that it is no
   ordinary token of gratitude which he promises, but such as God required
   for rare blessings; namely, that the faithful should come into his
   sanctuary, and there bear solemn testimony to the grace which they had
   received. The design of public and solemn thanksgiving is, that the
   faithful may employ themselves in all variety of ways, in serving and
   honoring God, and that they may encourage one another to act in the
   same manner. We know that God's wonderful power shone forth in the
   protection of David; and that not only by one miracle, but by many. It
   is, therefore, not wonderful that he brings himself under obligation,
   by a solemn vow, to make open and public profession of his piety and
   faithfulness towards God. By his brethren he means the Israelites; and
   he gives them this appellation, not only because he and they were both
   descended from the same parentage, but rather because the religion
   which they had in common, as a sacred bond, kept them united to one
   another by a spiritual relationship. The apostle, (Hebrews 2:12) in
   applying this verse to Christ, argues from it, that he was a partaker
   of the same nature with us, and joined to us by a true fellowship of
   the flesh, seeing he acknowledges us as his brethren, and vouchsafes to
   give us a title so honorable. I have already repeatedly stated, (and it
   is also easy to prove it from the end of this psalms) that under the
   figure of David, Christ has been here shadowed forth to us. The
   apostle, therefore, justly deduces from this, that under and by the
   name of brethren, the right of fraternal alliance with Christ has been
   confirmed to us. This, no doubt, to a certain extent belongs to all
   mankind, but the true enjoyment thereof belongs properly to genuine
   believers alone. For this reason Christ himself, with his own mouth,
   limits this title to his disciples, saying,

   "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your
   Father, and to my God and your God,"
   (John 20:17.)

   The ungodly, by means of their unbelief, break off and dissolve that
   relationship of the flesh, by which he has allied himself to us, and
   thus render themselves utter strangers to him by their own fault. As
   David, while he comprehended under the word brethren all the offspring
   of Abraham, immediately after (verse 23) particularly addresses his
   discourse to the true worshippers of God; so Christ, while he has
   broken down "the middle wall of partition" between Jews and Gentiles,
   and published the blessings of adoption to all nations, and thereby
   exhibited himself to them as a brother, retains in the degree of
   brethren none but true believers.

   23. Ye who fear Jehovah. Here, again, the Psalmist expresses more
   distinctly the fruit of public and solemn thanksgiving, of which I have
   spoken before, declaring, that by engaging in this exercise, every man
   in his own place invites and stirs up the church by his example to
   praise God. He tells us, that the end for which he will praise the name
   of God in the public assembly is to encourage his brethren to do the
   same. But as hypocrites commonly thrust themselves into the church, and
   as on the barn-floor of the Lord the chaff is mingled with the wheat,
   he addresses himself expressly to the godly, and those who fear God.
   Impure and wicked men may sing the praises of God with open mouth, but
   assuredly, they do nothing else than pollute and profane his holy name.
   It were, indeed, an object much to be desired, that men of all
   conditions in the world would, with one accord, join in holy melody to
   the Lord. But as the chief and most essential part of this harmony
   proceeds from a sincere and pure affection of heart, none will ever, in
   a right manner, celebrate the glory of God, except the man who worships
   him under the influence of holy fear. David names, a little after, the
   seed of Jacob and Israel, having a reference to the common calling of
   the people; and certainly, he put no obstacle in the way to hinder even
   all the children of Abraham from praising God with one accord. But as
   he saw that many of the Israelites were bastard and degenerate, he
   distinguishes true and sincere Israelites from them; and at the same
   time shows that God's name is not duly celebrated, unless where there
   is true piety and the inward fear of God. Accordingly, in his
   exhortation he again joins together the praises of God and reverence
   towards him. -- Fear him, ye seed of Israel, says he; for all the fair
   faces which hypocrites put on in this matter are nothing but pure
   mockery. The fear which he recommends is not, however, such as would
   frighten the faithful from approaching God, but that which will bring
   them truly humbled into his sanctuary, as has been stated in the fifth
   psalm. Some may be surprised to find David addressing an exhortation to
   praise God, [521] to those whom he had previously commended for doing
   so. But this is easily explained, for even the holiest men in the world
   are never so thoroughly imbued with the fear of God as not to have need
   of being continually incited to its exercise. Accordingly, the
   exhortation is not at all superfluous when, speaking of those who fear
   God, he exhorts them to stand in awe of him, and to prostrate
   themselves humbly before him.

   24. For he hath not despised. To rejoice in one another's good, and to
   give thanks in common for each other's welfare, is a branch of that
   communion which ought to exist among the people of God, as Paul also
   teaches,

   "That for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons,
   thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
   (2 Corinthians 1:11,)

   But this statement of David serves another important purpose -- it
   serves to encourage every man to hope that God will exercise the same
   mercy towards himself. By the way, we are taught from these words that
   the people of God ought to endure their afflictions patiently, however
   long it shall please the Lord to keep them in a state of distress, that
   he may at length succor them, and lend them his aid when they are so
   severely tried.

   [520] The second part of the psalm here commences. There is a
   transition from language of the deepest anguish to that of exalted joy
   and gratitude. The suffering Messiah here contemplates the blessed
   results of his sufferings.

   [521] It is "praise God," both in the Latin and French versions; but
   the train of thought seems to require that it should be "fear God."

   Psalm 22:25-29

   25. My praise shall proceed from thee [522] in the great assembly; I
   will pay my vows in the presence of them that fear him. 26. The poor
   shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise Jehovah that seek him:
   your heart shall live for ever. 27. All the ends of the earth shall
   remember, and turn to Jehovah; and all the tribes of the Gentiles shall
   prostrate themselves before his face. 28. For the kingdom is Jehovah's,
   that he may be the governor among the nations. 29. All the fat ones of
   the earth shall eat and worship; all those who are going down to the
   dust shall bow before him; and he who quickeneth not his own soul, [or
   he who is unable to keep himself alive.]


   25. My praise shall proceed from thee. I do not reject the other
   translation; but in my opinion, the Hebrew manner of expression here
   requires this sense - that David will take the matter of his song of
   praise from God. Accordingly, I supply the verb shall proceed, or shall
   flow, -- My praise shall proceed or flow from thee; and he made this
   statement in order to testify that he owed his deliverance entirely to
   God. We know that there are many who, under pretense of praising God,
   trumpet forth their own praises, and those of their friends, and
   leaving God in the back-ground, take occasion from one thing or another
   to celebrate their own triumphs. The Psalmist repeats what he had
   touched upon a little before, that he will show the tokens of his
   gratitude in a public manner, in order thereby to edify others. He
   adds, that among these tokens will be the solemn exercise of godliness
   enjoined by the law: I will pay my vows in the presence of them that
   fear him. In important affairs, and when threatened with imminent
   danger, it was a common practice among God's ancient people to vow a
   peace-offering, and after having obtained the object of their desire,
   they performed their vow. As David, therefore, belonged to the number
   of the saints, he conformed himself, as it became him, to that common
   and understood regulation of the Church. The vows which he promises to
   pay are those which he intimates he had made in his extreme distress,
   and he prepares himself to perform them with a noble and cheerful
   heart, yea, with a heart full of confidence. Now, although it behoved
   him to perform this solemn act of religion in the presence of the whole
   assembly without distinction, he again confesses it to be his desire,
   that all who should be present there to witness it should be the true
   worshippers of God. Thus, although it may not be in our power to
   cleanse the Church of God, it is our duty to desire her purity. The
   Papists, by wresting this passage to support their false and deceitful
   vows, show themselves so stupid and so ridiculous, that it is
   unnecessary to spend much time in refuting them. What resemblance is
   there between these childish fooleries, with which according to their
   own imagination they attempt to appease God, and this holy testimony of
   gratitude, which not only a true sense of religion and the fear of God
   suggested to the fathers, but which God himself has commanded and
   ratified in his law? Yea, how can they have the face to equal their
   foolish and infamous superstitions to the most precious of all
   sacrifices - the sacrifice of thanksgiving? even as the Scriptures
   testify, that the principal part of the service of God consists in
   this, that true believers publicly and solemnly acknowledge that he is
   the author of all good things.

   26. The poor shall eat. The Psalmist has a reference to the custom
   which was at that time prevalent among the Jews, of feasting on their
   sacrifices, as is very well known. He here promises this feast, in
   order to exercise and prove his charity. And surely that is a pleasant
   and an acceptable oblation to God to which compassion and mercy are
   joined. Without these, the ceremonies by which men profess to worship
   God, with all their pomp and magnificence, vanish into smoke. David
   does not, however, simply promise to bestow upon the poor and the
   hungry something for the mere nourishment of the body. He declares that
   they shall be partakers of this feast for another purpose, namely, that
   matter of comfort being ministered to them, joy might be restored to
   their hearts and flourish afresh. For they saw in that feast, as in a
   mirror, the goodness of God set forth to all who are in affliction,
   which might assuage with wonderful consolation the grief arising from
   all their calamities. The Psalmist therefore adds, They shall praise
   Jehovah that seek him. The abundant repast of which they had partaken
   ought, no doubt, to have incited them to give thanks to God; but what
   is particularly meant is, praising God for that deliverance in grateful
   commemoration of which the sacrifice was offered. This appears still
   more clearly from the last clause of the verse: Your heart shall live
   for ever One meal could not have sufficed to make their hearts live for
   ever. It was rather the hope which they entertained of having ready
   succor from God which did this; for all the faithful justly reckoned
   the deliverance of this one man as a deliverance wrought for themselves
   in particular. Whence it follows, that, in the peace-offerings, the
   praises of God were so celebrated, as that genuine worshippers also
   exercised their hope in them. Farther, as hypocrites content themselves
   with merely going through the bare and lifeless ceremony, the Psalmist
   restricts the right performance of this exercise to true and holy
   Israelites; They shall praise Jehovah that seek him; and to seek God is
   the certain mark of genuine godliness. Now, if the fathers under the
   law had their spiritual life renewed and invigorated by their holy
   feasts, this virtue will show itself much more abundantly at this day
   in the holy supper of Christ, provided those who come to partake of it
   seek the Lord truly, and with their whole heart.

   27. All the ends of the earth shall remember. This passage, beyond all
   doubt, shows that David stops not at his own person, but that under
   himself, as a type, he describes the promised Messiah. For even then,
   it ought to have been a well-known point, that he had been created king
   by God, that the people might be united together and enjoy a happy life
   under one head; and this was at length completely fulfilled in Christ.
   David's name, I admit, was great and renowned among the neighboring
   nations; but what was the territory which they occupied in comparison
   of the whole world? Besides, the foreign nations whom he had subdued
   had never been converted by him to the true worship of God. That forced
   and slavish submission, therefore, which the heathen nations had been
   brought by conquest to yield to an earthly king, was very different
   from the willing obedience of true godliness by which they would be
   recovered from their miserable wanderings, and gathered to God. Nor
   does the Psalmist mean an ordinary change, when he says, that the
   nations shall return to God, after having become well acquainted with
   his grace. Moreover, by uniting them to the fellowship of the holy
   feast, he manifestly grafts them into the body of the Church. Some
   explain these words, They shall remember, as meaning, that upon the
   restoration of the light of faith to the Gentiles, they should then
   come to remember God, whom they had for a time forgotten; [523] but
   this seems to me too refined, and far from the meaning. I allow that
   the conversion or return of which mention is here made, implies that
   they had previously been alienated from God by wicked defection; but
   this remembrance simply means that the Gentiles, awakened by the signal
   miracles wrought by God, would again come to embrace the true religion,
   from which they had fallen away. Farther, it is to be observed, that
   the true worship of God proceeds from the knowledge of him; for the
   language of the Psalmist implies, that those shall come to prostrate
   themselves before God, in humble adoration, who shall have profited so
   far in meditation upon his works, as that they shall have no more
   desire proudly and contemptuously to break forth against him.

   This sense is more fully confirmed by the reason [524] which is added
   in the following verse, (28) The kingdom is Jehovah's, that he may rule
   over the nations Some explain these words thus:- It is not to be
   wondered at if the Gentiles should be constrained to yield honor to
   God, by whom they were created, and by whose hand they are governed,
   although he has not entered into a covenant of life with them. But I
   reject this as a meagre and unsatisfactory interpretation. This
   passage, I have no doubt, agrees with many other prophecies which
   represent the throne of God as erected, on which Christ may sit to
   superintend and govern the world. Although, therefore, the providence
   of God is extended to the whole world, without any part of it being
   excepted; yet let us remember that he then, in very deed, exercises his
   authority, when having dispelled the darkness of ignorance, and
   diffused the light of his word, he appears conspicuous on his throne.
   We have such a description of his kingdom by the prophet Isaiah,

   "He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people."
   (Isaiah 2:4)

   Moreover, as God had not subdued the world to himself, prior to the
   time when those who before were unconquerable were subdued to a willing
   obedience by the preaching of the gospel, we may conclude that this
   conversion was effected only under the management and government of
   Christ. If it is objected, that the whole world has never yet been
   converted, the solution is easy. A comparison is here made between that
   remarkable period in which God suddenly became known every where, by
   the preaching of the gospel, and the ancient dispensation, when he kept
   the knowledge of himself shut up within the limits of Judea. Christ, we
   know, penetrated with amazing speed, from the east to the west, like
   the lightning's flash, in order to bring into the Church the Gentiles
   from all parts of the world.

   29. All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship. Lest it should
   be thought inconsistent that now the fat ones of the earth are admitted
   as guests to this banquet, which David seemed immediately before to
   have appointed only for the poor, let us remember that the first place
   was given to the poor, because to them principally comfort was set
   forth in the example of David. Yet it was necessary, in the second
   place, that the rich and the prosperous should be called to the feast,
   that they might not think themselves excluded from the participation of
   the same grace. They are not, it is true, urged, by the pressure of
   present calamities, to seek comfort for grief, but they have need of a
   remedy to prevent them from intoxicating themselves with their
   delights, and to excite them rather to lay up their joy in heaven.
   Again, since they also are subject to a variety of troubles, their
   abundance will be a curse to them, provided it keep their minds down to
   the earth. The amount of the Psalmist's statement is, that this
   sacrifice will be common as well to those who are sound, lusty, and in
   opulent circumstances, as to those who are lean, poor, and half dead
   from the want of food; that the former, laying aside their pride, may
   humble themselves before God, and that the latter, though they may be
   brought low, may lift up their minds by spiritual joy to God, the
   author of all good things, as James (James 1:9, 10) admonishes both
   classes, in these words, "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that
   he is exalted; but the rich in that he is made low." Now, if God, under
   the law, joined the full with the hungry, the noble with the mean, the
   happy with the wretched, much more ought this to take place at the
   present day under the gospel. When, therefore, the rich hear that food
   is offered to them elsewhere than in earthly abundance, let them learn
   to use the outward good things which God has bestowed upon them for the
   purposes of the present life, with such sobriety as that they may not
   be disgusted with spiritual food, or turn away from it, through
   loathing. So long as they wallow in their own filth, they will never
   long for this food with a holy desire; and although they may have it at
   hand, they will never take pleasure in tasting it. [525] Farther, as
   those who are fat must become lean, in order that they may present
   themselves to God to be fed and nourished, so David endeavors to
   inspire the famished with assured and undaunted confidence, lest their
   poverty should hinder them from coming to the banquet. Yea, he invites
   even the dead to come to the feast, in order that the most despised,
   and those who, in the estimation of the world, are almost like
   putrefying carcases, may be encouraged and emboldened to present
   themselves at the holy table of the Lord. The change which the Psalmist
   makes in the number, from the plural to the singular, in the end of the
   verse, somewhat obscures the sense; but the meaning undoubtedly is,
   that those who seem already to be reduced to dust, and whose
   restoration from death to life is, as it were, despaired of, shall be
   partakers of the same grace with him.

   Psalm 22:30-31

   30. Their seed shall serve him, and shall be registered to the Lord
   [526] for a generation. 31. They shall come, and shall declare his
   righteousness to a people that shall be born, because he hath done it.


   30. Their seed shall serve him. The more to exalt the greatness of the
   benefit, he declares that it will be of such a character that posterity
   will never forget it. And he shows how it will come to be perpetuated,
   namely, because the conversion of the world, of which he has spoken,
   will not be for a short time only but will continue from age to age.
   Whence we again conclude, that what is here celebrated is not such a
   manifestation of the glory of God to the Gentile nations as proceeds
   from a transitory and fading rumor, but such as will enlighten the
   world with its beams, even to the end of time. Accordingly, the
   perpetuity of the Church is here abundantly proved, and in very clear
   terms: not that it always flourishes or continues in the same uniform
   course through successive ages, but because God, unwilling that his
   name should be extinguished in the world, will always raise up some
   sincerely to devote themselves to his service. We ought to remember
   that this seed, in which the service of God was to be preserved, is the
   fruit of the incorruptible seed; for God begets and multiplies his
   Church only by means of his word.

   The expression, To be registered to the Lord for a generation, is
   explained in two ways. Some take the Hebrew word dvr, dor, for a
   succession of ages, and explain the clause thus: They shall be
   registered to the Lord age after age. Others take it for generation, in
   the sense in which the word natio [nation] is used in the Latin tongue.
   As both these senses suit very well, and come almost to the same thing,
   I leave my readers at liberty to choose between them. I am, however, I
   admit, rather inclined to the opinion, that by this word is designated
   God's chosen people and peculiar nation, which may be accounted the
   heritage of God. Farther, as the name Jehovah, which is expressive of
   God's essence, is not here used as it is a little before, but the word
   Adonai, I do not disapprove of the opinion of those who think that
   Christ is here expressly invested with authority over [527] the Church,
   that he may register all who shall give in their names as on the side
   of God his Father. And, indeed, as our heavenly Father has committed
   all his chosen ones to the protection and guardianship of his own Son,
   he acknowledges as his people none but those who belong to the flock of
   Christ.

   31. They shall come, and shall declare. The Psalmist here confirms what
   I have previously stated, that since the fathers will transmit the
   knowledge of this benefit to their children, as it were from hand to
   hand, the name of God will be always renowned. From this we may also
   deduce the additional truth, that it is by the preaching of the grace
   of God alone that the Church is kept from perishing. At the same time,
   let it be observed, that care and diligence in propagating divine truth
   are here enjoined upon us, that it may continue after we are removed
   from this world. As the Holy Spirit prescribes it as a duty incumbent
   on all the faithful to be diligent in instructing their children, that
   there may be always one generation after another to serve God, the
   sluggishness of those who have no scruple of conscience in burying the
   remembrance of God in eternal silence, a sin with which those are
   virtually chargeable who neglect to speak of him to their children, and
   who thus do nothing to prevent his name from utterly perishing, is
   condemned as involving the greatest turpitude. The term righteousness,
   in this place, refers to the faithfulness which God observes in
   preserving his people, of which we have a memorable example in the
   deliverance of David. In defending his servant from the violence and
   outrage of the wicked, he proved himself to be righteous. Hence we may
   learn how dear our welfare is to God, seeing he combines it with the
   celebration of the praise of his own righteousness. If then the
   righteousness of God is illustriously manifested in this, that he does
   not disappoint us of our hope, nor abandon us in dangers, but defends
   and keeps us in perfect safety, there is no more reason to fear that he
   will forsake us in the time of our need, than there is reason to fear
   that he can forget himself. We must, however, remember that it is not
   for any particular succor afforded to one individual, but it is for the
   redemption of the human race, that the celebration of the praise of God
   is required from us in this passage. In short, the Holy Spirit, by the
   mouth of David, recommends to us the publication of Christ's
   resurrection. In the end of this psalm some commentators resolve the
   particle ky, ki, because, into the pronoun 'sr, asher, which, as if it
   had been said, The righteousness which he hath done. But the sentence
   will be fuller if we read, because, and explain the passage thus: They
   shall come, and shall declare his righteousness, because God shall have
   given proof, or demonstration, of his righteousness - shall have
   afforded evidence by the effect, or the deed itself, that he is the
   faithful guardian of his own people.

   PSALM 23.

   This psalm is neither intermingled with prayers, nor does it complain
   of miseries for the purpose of obtaining relief; but it contains simply
   a thanksgiving, from which it appears that it was composed when David
   had obtained peaceable possession of the kingdom, and lived in
   prosperity, and in the enjoyment of all he could desire. That he might
   not, therefore, in the time of his great prosperity, be like worldly
   men, who, when they seem to themselves to be fortunate, [528] bury God
   in forgetfulness, and luxuriously plunge themselves into their
   pleasures, he delights himself in God, the author of all the blessings
   which he enjoyed. And he not only acknowledges that the state of
   tranquillity in which he now lives, and his exemption from all
   inconveniences and troubles, is owing to the goodness of God; but he
   also trusts that through his providence he will continue happy even to
   the close of his life, and for this end that he may employ himself in
   his pure worship.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 23:1-4

   1. Jehovah is my shepherd, I shall not want. [529] 2. He maketh me to
   lie down in pastures of grass; he leadeth me to gently flowing waters.
   [530] 3. He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me by the paths of
   righteousness for his name's sake. 4. Though I should walk in the
   valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with
   me; thy staff and thy crook comfort me.


   1. Jehovah is my shepherd. Although God, by his benefits, gently
   allures us to himself, as it were by a taste of his fatherly sweetness,
   yet there is nothing into which we more easily fall than into a
   forgetfulness of him, when we are in the enjoyment of peace and
   comfort. Yea, prosperity not only so intoxicates many, as to carry them
   beyond all bounds in their mirth, but it also engenders insolence,
   which makes them proudly rise up and break forth against God.
   Accordingly, there is scarcely a hundredth part of those who enjoy in
   abundance the good things of God, who keep themselves in his fear, and
   live in the exercise of humility and temperance, which would be so
   becoming. [531] For this reason, we ought the more carefully to mark
   the example which is here set before us by David, who, elevated to the
   dignity of sovereign power, surrounded with the splendor of riches and
   honors, possessed of the greatest abundance of temporal good things,
   and in the midst of princely pleasures, not only testifies that he is
   mindful of God, but calling to remembrance the benefits which God had
   conferred upon him, [532] makes them ladders by which he may ascend
   nearer to Him. By this means he not only bridles the wantonness of his
   flesh, but also excites himself with the greater earnestness to
   gratitude, and the other exercises of godliness, as appears from the
   concluding sentence of the psalm, where he says, "I shall dwell in the
   house of Jehovah for a length of days." In like manner, in the 18th
   psalm, which was composed at a period of his life when he was applauded
   on every side, by calling himself the servant of God, he showed the
   humility and simplicity of heart to which he had attained, and, at the
   same time, openly testified his gratitude, by applying himself to the
   celebration of the praises of God.

   Under the similitude of a shepherd, he commends the care which God, in
   his providence, had exercised towards him. His language implies that
   God had no less care of him than a shepherd has of the sheep who are
   committed to his charge. God, in the Scripture, frequently takes to
   himself the name, and puts on the character of a shepherd, and this is
   no mean token of his tender love towards us. As this is a lowly and
   homely manner of speaking, He who does not disdain to stoop so low for
   our sake, must bear a singularly strong affection towards us. It is
   therefore wonderful, that when he invites us to himself with such
   gentleness and familiarity, we are not drawn or allured to him, that we
   may rest in safety and peace under his guardianship. But it should be
   observed, that God is a shepherd only to those who, touched with a
   sense of their own weakness and poverty, feel their need of his
   protection, and who willingly abide in his sheepfold, and surrender
   themselves to be governed by him. David, who excelled both in power and
   riches, nevertheless frankly confessed himself to be a poor sheep, that
   he might have God for his shepherd. Who is there, then, amongst us, who
   would exempt himself from this necessity, seeing our own weakness
   sufficiently shows that we are more than miserable if we do not live
   under the protection of this shepherd? We ought to bear in mind, that
   our happiness consists in this, that his hand is stretched forth to
   govern us, that we live under his shadow, and that his providence keeps
   watch and ward over our welfare. Although, therefore, we have abundance
   of all temporal good things, yet let us be assured that we cannot be
   truly happy unless God vouchsafe to reckon us among the number of his
   flock. Besides, we then only attribute to God the office of a Shepherd
   with due and rightful honor, when we are persuaded that his providence
   alone is sufficient to supply all our necessities. [533] As those who
   enjoy the greatest abundance of outward good things are empty and
   famished if God is not their shepherd; so it is beyond all doubt that
   those whom he has taken under his charge shall not want a full
   abundance of all good things. David, therefore, declares that he is not
   afraid of wanting any thing, because God is his Shepherd.

   2. He maketh me to lie down in pastures of grass. With respect to the
   words, it is in the Hebrew, pastures, or fields of grass, for grassy
   and rich grounds. Some, instead of translating the word n'vt, neoth,
   which we have rendered pastures, render it shepherds' cots or lodges.
   If this translation is considered preferable, the meaning of the
   Psalmist will be, that sheep-cots were prepared in rich pasture
   grounds, under which he might be protected from the heat of the sun. If
   even in cold countries the immoderate heat which sometimes occurs is
   troublesome to a flock of sheep, how could they bear the heat of the
   summer in Judea, a warm region, without sheepfolds? The verb rvph,
   rabats, to lie down, or repose, seems to have a reference to the same
   thing. David has used the phrase, the quiet waters, to express gently
   flowing waters; for rapid streams are inconvenient for sheep to drink
   in, and are also for the most part hurtful. In this verse, and in the
   verses following, he explains the last clause of the first verse, I
   shall not want. He relates how abundantly God had provided for all his
   necessities, and he does this without departing from the comparison
   which he employed at the commencement. The amount of what is stated is,
   that the heavenly Shepherd had omitted nothing which might contribute
   to make him live happily under his care. He, therefore, compares the
   great abundance of all things requisite for the purposes of the present
   life which he enjoyed, to meadows richly covered with grass, and to
   gently flowing streams of water; or he compares the benefit or
   advantage of such things to sheep-cots; for it would not have been
   enough to have been fed and satisfied in rich pasture, had there not
   also been provided waters to drink, and the shadow of the sheep-cot to
   cool and refresh him.

   3. He restoreth my soul As it is the duty of a good shepherd to cherish
   his sheep, and when they are diseased or weak to nurse and support
   them, David declares that this was the manner in which he was treated
   by God. The restoring of the soul, as we have translated it, or the
   conversion of the soul, as it is, literally rendered, is of the same
   import as to make anew, or to recover, as has been already stated in
   the 19th psalm, at the seventh verse. By the paths of righteousness, he
   means easy and plain paths. [534] As he still continues his metaphor,
   it would be out of place to understand this as referring to the
   direction of the Holy Spirit. He has stated a little before that God
   liberally supplies him with all that is requisite for the maintenance
   of the present life, and now he adds, that he is defended by him from
   all trouble. The amount of what is said is, that God is in no respect
   wanting to his people, seeing he sustains them by his power,
   invigorates and quickens them, and averts from them whatever is
   hurtful, that they may walk at ease in plain and straight paths. That,
   however, he may not ascribe any thing to his own worth or merit, David
   represents the goodness of God as the cause of so great liberality,
   declaring that God bestows all these things upon him for his own name's
   sake. And certainly his choosing us to be his sheep, and his performing
   towards us all the offices of a shepherd, is a blessing which proceeds
   entirely from his free and sovereign goodness, as we shall see in the
   [9]sixty-fifth psalm.

   4. Though I should walk. True believers, although they dwell safely
   under the protection of God, are, notwithstanding, exposed to many
   dangers, or rather they are liable to all the afflictions which befall
   mankind in common, that they may the better feel how much they need the
   protection of God. David, therefore, here expressly declares, that if
   any adversity should befall him, he would lean upon the providence of
   God. Thus he does not promise himself continual pleasures; but he
   fortifies himself by the help of God courageously to endure the various
   calamities with which he might be visited. Pursuing his metaphor, he
   compares the care which God takes in governing true believers to a
   shepherd's staff and crook, declaring that he is satisfied with this as
   all-sufficient for the protection of his life. As a sheep, when it
   wanders up and down through a dark valley, is preserved safe from the
   attacks of wild beasts and from harm in other ways, by the presence of
   the shepherd alone, so David now declares that as often as he shall be
   exposed to any danger, he will have sufficient defense and protection
   in being under the pastoral care of God.

   We thus see how, in his prosperity, he never forgot that he was a man,
   but even then seasonably meditated on the adversities which afterwards
   might come upon him. And certainly, the reason why we are so terrified,
   when it pleases God to exercise us with the cross, is, because every
   man, that he may sleep soundly and undisturbed, wraps himself up in
   carnal security. But there is a great difference between this sleep of
   stupidity and the repose which faith produces. Since God tries faith by
   adversity, it follows that no one truly confides in God, but he who is
   armed with invincible constancy for resisting all the fears with which
   he may be assailed. [535] Yet David did not mean to say that he was
   devoid of all fear, but only that he would surmount it so as to go
   without fear wherever his shepherd should lead him. This appears more
   clearly from the context. He says, in the first place, I will fear no
   evil; but immediately adding the reason of this, he openly acknowledges
   that he seeks a remedy against his fear in contemplating, and having
   his eyes fixed on, the staff of his shepherd: For thy staff and thy
   crook comfort me. What need would he have had of that consolation, if
   he had not been disquieted and agitated with fear? It ought, therefore,
   to be kept in mind, that when David reflected on the adversities which
   might befall him, he became victorious over fear and temptations, in no
   other way than by casting himself on the protection of God. This he had
   also stated before, although a little more obscurely, in these words,
   For thou art with me. This implies that he had been afflicted with
   fear. Had not this been the case, for what purpose could he desire the
   presence of God? [536] Besides, it is not against the common and
   ordinary calamities of life only that he opposes the protection of God,
   but against those which distract and confound the minds of men with the
   darkness of death. For the Jewish grammarians think that tslmvt,
   tsalmaveth, which we have translated the shadow of death, is a compound
   word, as if one should say deadly shade. [537] David here makes an
   allusion to the dark recesses or dens of wild beasts, to which when an
   individual approaches he is suddenly seized at his first entrance with
   an apprehension and fear of death. Now, since God, in the person of his
   only begotten Son, has exhibited himself to us as our shepherd, much
   more clearly than he did in old time to the fathers who lived under the
   Law, we do not render sufficient honor to his protecting care, if we do
   not lift our eyes to behold it, and keeping them fixed upon it, tread
   all fears and terrors under our feet. [538]

   Psalm 23:5-6

   5. Thou wilt prepare a table before me in the presence of my
   persecutors: thou wilt anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6.
   Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life; and I
   shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for a length of days.


   5. Thou wilt prepare. These words, which are put in the future tense,
   here denote a continued act. David, therefore, now repeats, without a
   figure, what he has hitherto declared, concerning the beneficence of
   God, under the similitude of a shepherd. He tells us that by his
   liberality he is supplied with all that is necessary for the
   maintenance of this life. When he says, Thou preparest a table before
   me, he means that God furnished him with sustenance without trouble or
   difficulty on his part, just as if a father should stretch forth his
   hand to give food to his child. He enhances this benefit from the
   additional consideration, that although many malicious persons envy his
   happiness, and desire his ruin, yea, endeavor to defraud him of the
   blessing of God; yet God does not desist from showing himself liberal
   towards him, and from doing him good. What he subjoins concerning oil,
   has a reference to a custom which then prevailed. We know that in old
   time, ointments were used at the more magnificent feasts, and no man
   thought he had honourably received his guests if he had not perfumed
   them therewith. Now, this exuberant store of oil, and also this
   overflowing cup, ought to be explained as denoting the abundance which
   goes beyond the mere supply of the common necessaries of life; for it
   is spoken in commendation of the royal wealth with which, as the sacred
   historian records, David had been amply furnished. All men, it is true,
   are not treated with the same liberality with which David was treated;
   but there is not an individual who is not under obligation to God by
   the benefits which God has conferred upon him, so that we are
   constrained to acknowledge that he is a kind and liberal Father to all
   his people. In the meantime, let each of us stir up himself to
   gratitude to God for his benefits, and the more abundantly these have
   been bestowed upon us, our gratitude ought to be the greater. If he is
   ungrateful who, having only a coarse loaf, does not acknowledge in that
   the fatherly providence of God, how much less can the stupidity of
   those be tolerated, who glut themselves with the great abundance of the
   good things of God which they possess, without having any sense or
   taste of his goodness towards them? David, therefore, by his own
   example, admonishes the rich of their duty, that they may be the more
   ardent in the expression of their gratitude to God, the more delicately
   he feeds them. Farther, let us remember, that those who have greater
   abundance than others are bound to observe moderation not less than if
   they had only as much of the good things of this life as would serve
   for their limited and temperate enjoyment. We are too much inclined by
   nature to excess; and, therefore, when God is, in respect of worldly
   things, bountiful to his people, it is not to stir up and nourish in
   them this disease. All men ought to attend to the rule of Paul, which
   is laid down in Philippians 4:12, that they "may know both how to be
   abased, and how to abound." That want may not sink us into despondency,
   we need to be sustained by patient endurance; and, on the other hand,
   that too great abundance may not elate us above measure, we need to be
   restrained by the bridle of temperance. Accordingly, the Lord, when he
   enriches his own people, restrains, at the same time, the licentious
   desires of the flesh by the spirit of confidence, so that, of their own
   accord, they prescribe to themselves rules of temperance. Not that it
   is unlawful for rich men to enjoy more freely the abundance which they
   possess than if God had given them a smaller portion; but all men ought
   to beware, (and much more kings,) lest they should be dissolved in
   voluptuous pleasures. David, no doubt, as was perfectly lawful, allowed
   himself larger scope than if he had been only one of the common people,
   or than if he had still dwelt in his father's cottage, but he so
   regulated himself in the midst of his delicacies, as not at all to take
   pleasure in stuffing and fattening the body. He knew well how to
   distinguish between the table which God had prepared for him and a
   trough for swine. It is also worthy of particular notice, that although
   David lived upon his own lands, the tribute money and other revenues of
   the kingdom, he gave thanks to God just as if God had daily given him
   his food with his own hand. From this we conclude that he was not
   blinded with his riches, but always looked upon God as his householder,
   who brought forth meat and drink from his own store, and distributed it
   to him at the proper season.

   6. Surely goodness and mercy. Having recounted the blessings which God
   had bestowed upon him, he now expresses his undoubted persuasion of the
   continuance of them to the end of his life. But whence proceeded this
   confidence, by which he assures himself that the beneficence and mercy
   of God will accompany him for ever, if it did not arise from the
   promise by which God is accustomed to season the blessings which he
   bestows upon true believers, that they may not inconsiderately devour
   them without having any taste or relish for them? When he said to
   himself before, that even amidst the darkness of death he would keep
   his eyes fixed in beholding the providence of God, he sufficiently
   testified that he did not depend upon outward things, nor measured the
   grace of God according to the judgment of the flesh, but that even when
   assistance from every earthly quarter failed him, his faith continued
   shut up in the word of God. Although, therefore, experience led him to
   hope well, yet it was principally on the promise by which God confirms
   his people with respect to the future that he depended. If it is
   objected that it is presumption for a man to promise himself a
   continued course of prosperity in this uncertain and changing world, I
   answer, that David did not speak in this manner with the view of
   imposing on God a law; but he hoped for such exercise of God's
   beneficence towards him as the condition of this world permits, with
   which he would be contented. He does not say, My cup shall be always
   full, or, My head shall be always perfumed with oil; but in general he
   entertains the hope that as the goodness of God never fails, he will be
   favorable towards him even to the end.

   I will dwell in the house of Jehovah. By this concluding sentence he
   manifestly shows that he does not confine his thoughts to earthly
   pleasures or comforts; but that the mark at which he aims is fixed in
   heaven, and to reach this was his great object in all things. It is as
   if he had said, I do not live for the mere purpose of living, but
   rather to exercise myself in the fear and service of God, and to make
   progress daily in all the branches of true godliness. He makes a
   manifest distinction between himself and ungodly men, who take pleasure
   only in filling their bellies with luxuriant fare. And not only so, but
   he also intimates that to live to God is, in his estimation, of so
   great importance, that he valued all the comforts of the flesh only in
   proportion as they served to enable him to live to God. He plainly
   affirms, that the end which he contemplated in all the benefits which
   God had conferred upon him was, that he might dwell in the house of the
   Lord. Whence it follows, that when deprived of the enjoyment of this
   blessing, he made no account of all other things; as if he had said, I
   would take no pleasure in earthly comforts, unless I at the same time
   belonged to the flock of God, as he also writes in another place,

   "Happy is that people that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people
   whose God is the Lord," (Psalm 144:15.)

   Why did he desire so greatly to frequent the temple, but to offer
   sacrifices there along with his fellow-worshippers, and to improve by
   the other exercises of religion in meditation upon the celestial life?
   It is, therefore, certain that the mind of David, by the aid of the
   temporal prosperity which he enjoyed, was elevated to the hope of the
   everlasting inheritance. From this we conclude, that those men are
   brutish who propose to themselves any other felicity than that which
   arises from drawing near to God.

   PSALM 24.

   As God stands related to all mankind as their Creator and Governor,
   David, from this consideration, magnifies the special favor which God
   manifested towards the children of Abraham, in choosing them to be his
   peculiar people, in preference to the rest of mankind, and in erecting
   his sanctuary as his house that he might dwell among them. He shows, at
   the same time, that although the sanctuary was open to all the Jews,
   God was not near to all of them, but only to those who feared and
   served him in sincerity, and who had cleansed themselves from the
   pollutions of the world, in order to devote themselves to holiness and
   righteousness. Moreover, as the grace of God was more clearly
   manifested after the temple was built, he celebrates that grace in a
   strain of splendid poetry, to encourage true believers with the more
   alacrity to persevere in the exercise of serving and honoring him.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 24:1-4

   1. The earth is Jehovah's, and the fullness thereof; [539] the world,
   and they that dwell therein: 2. For he hath founded it upon the seas,
   and established it upon the floods. 3. Who shall ascend unto the hill
   of Jehovah? who shall stand in his holy place? 4. He who is clean of
   hands, and pure of heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity,
   nor sworn deceitfully.


   1. The earth is Jehovah's. We will find in many other places the
   children of Abraham compared with all the rest of mankind, that the
   free goodness of God, in selecting them from all other nations, and in
   embracing them with his favor, may shine forth the more conspicuously.
   The object of the beginning of the psalm is to show that the Jews had
   nothing of themselves which could entitle them to approach nearer or
   more familiarly to God than the Gentiles. As God by his providence
   preserves the world, the power of his government is alike extended to
   all, so that he ought to be worshipped by all, even as he also shows to
   all men, without exception, the fatherly care he has about them. But
   since he preferred the Jews to all other nations, it was indispensably
   necessary that there should be some sacred bond of connection between
   him and them, which might distinguish them from the heathen nations. By
   this argument David invites and exhorts them to holiness. He tells them
   that it was reasonable that those whom God had adopted as his children,
   should bear certain marks peculiar to themselves, and not be altogether
   like strangers. Not that he incites them to endeavor to prejudice God
   against others, in order to gain his exclusive favor; but he teaches
   them, from the end or design of their election, that they shall then
   have secured to them the firm and peaceful possession of the honor
   which God had conferred upon them above other nations, when they devote
   themselves to an upright and holy life. [540] In vain would they have
   been collected together into a distinct body, as the peculiar people of
   God, if they did not apply themselves to the cultivation of holiness.
   In short, the Psalmist pronounces God to be the King of the whole
   world, to let all men know that, even by the law of nature, they are
   bound to serve him. And by declaring that he made a covenant of
   salvation with a small portion of mankind, and by the erection of the
   tabernacle, gave the children of Abraham the symbol of his presence,
   thereby to assure them of his dwelling in the midst of them, he teaches
   them that they must endeavor to have purity of heart and of hands, if
   they would be accounted the members of his sacred family.

   With respect to the word fullness, I admit that under it all the riches
   with which the earth is adorned are comprehended, as is proved by the
   authority of Paul; but I have no doubt that the Psalmist intends by the
   expression men themselves, who are the most illustrious ornament and
   glory of the earth. If they should fail, the earth would exhibit a
   scene of desolation and solitude, not less hideous than if God should
   despoil it of all its other riches. To what purpose are there produced
   so many kinds of fruit, and in so great abundance, and why are there so
   many pleasant and delightful countries, if it is not for the use and
   comfort of men? [541] Accordingly, David explains, in the following
   clause, that it is principally of men that he speaks. It is his usual
   manner to repeat the same thing twice, and here the fullness of the
   earth, and the inhabitants of the world, have the same meaning. I do
   not, however, deny that the riches with which the earth abounds for the
   use of men, are comprehended under these expressions. Paul, therefore,
   (1 Corinthians 10:26) when discoursing concerning meats, justly quotes
   this passage in support of his argument, maintaining that no kind of
   food is unclean, because, "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness
   thereof."

   2. For he hath founded it upon the seas. The Psalmist here confirms the
   truth, that men are rightfully under the authority and power of God, so
   that in all places and countries they ought to acknowledge him as King.
   And he confirms it from the very order manifested in the creation; for
   the wonderful providence of God is clearly reflected in the whole face
   of the earth. In order to prove this, he brings forward the proof of
   it, which is most evident. How is it that the earth appears above the
   water, but because God purposely intended to prepare a habitation for
   men? Philosophers themselves admit, that as the element of the water is
   higher than the earth, it is contrary to the nature of the two elements
   [542] for any part of the earth to continue uncovered with the waters,
   and habitable. Accordingly, Job (Job 28:11, 25) extols, in magnificent
   terms, that signal miracle by which God restrains the violent and
   tempestuous ragings of the sea, that it may not overwhelm the earth,
   which, if not thus restrained, it would immediately do and produce
   horrible confusion. Nor does Moses forget to mention this in the
   history of the creation. After having narrated that the waters were
   spread abroad so as to cover the whole earth, he adds, that by an
   express command of God they retired into one place, in order to leave
   empty space for the living creatures which were afterwards to be
   created, (Genesis 1:9) From that passage we learn that God had a care
   about men before they existed, inasmuch as he prepared for them a
   dwelling-place and other conveniences; and that he did not regard them
   as entire strangers, seeing he provided for their necessities, not less
   liberally than the father of a family does for his own children. David
   does not here dispute philosophically concerning the situation of the
   earth, when he says, that it has been founded upon the seas. He uses
   popular language, and adapts himself to the capacity of the unlearned.
   Yet this manner of speaking, which is taken from what may be judged of
   by the eye, is not without reason. The element of earth, it is true, in
   so far as it occupies the lowest place in the order of the sphere, is
   beneath the waters; but the habitable part of the earth is above the
   water, and how can we account for it, that this separation of the water
   from the earth remains stable, but because God has put the waters
   underneath, as it were for a foundation? Now, as from the creation of
   the world, God extended his fatherly care to all mankind, the
   prerogative of honor, by which the Jews excelled all other nations,
   proceeded only from the free and sovereign choice by which God
   distinguished them.

   3. Who shall ascend unto. It being very well known that it was of pure
   grace that God erected his sanctuary, and chose for himself a
   dwelling-place among the Jews, David makes only a tacit reference to
   this subject. [543] He insists principally on the other point contained
   in the verse, that of distinguishing true Israelites from the false and
   bastards. He takes the argument by which he exhorts the Jews to lead a
   holy and righteous life from this, that God had separated them from the
   rest of the world, to be his peculiar inheritance. The rest of mankind,
   it is true, seeing they were created by him, belong to his empire; but
   he who occupies a place in the church is more nearly related to him.
   All those, therefore, whom God receives into his flock he calls to
   holiness; and he lays them under obligations to follow it by his
   adoption. Moreover, by these words David indirectly rebukes hypocrites,
   who scrupled not falsely to take to themselves the holy name of God, as
   we know that they are usually lifted up with pride, because of the
   titles which they take without having the excellencies which these
   titles imply, contenting themselves with bearing only outside
   distinctions; [544] yea, rather he purposely magnifies this singular
   grace of God, that every man may learn for himself, that he has no
   right of entrance or access to the sanctuary, unless he sanctify
   himself in order to serve God in purity. The ungodly and wicked, it is
   true, were in the habit of resorting to the tabernacle; and, therefore,
   God, by the Prophet Isaiah, (Isaiah 1:12) reproaches them for coming
   unworthily into his courts, and wearing the pavement thereof. But David
   here treats of those who may lawfully enter into God's sanctuary. The
   house of God being holy, if any rashly, and without a right, rush into
   it, their corruption and abuse are nothing else but polluting it. As
   therefore they do not go up thither lawfully, David makes no account of
   their going up; yea, rather, under these words there is included a
   severe rebuke, of the conduct of wicked and profane men, in daring to
   go up into the sanctuary, and to pollute it with their impurity. On
   this subject I have spoken more fully on the 15th psalm. In the second
   part of the verse he seems to denote perseverance, as if he had said,
   Who shall go up into the hill of Sion, to appear and stand in the
   presence of God? The Hebrew word qvm, kum, it is true, sometimes
   signifies to rise up, but it is generally taken for to stand, as we
   have seen in the first psalm. And although this is a repetition of the
   same idea, stated in the preceding clause, it is not simply so, but
   David, by expressing the end for which they ought to go up, illustrates
   and amplifies the subject; and this repetition and amplification we
   find him often making use of in other psalms. In short, how much soever
   the wicked were mingled with the good in the church, in the time of
   David, he declares how vain a thing it is to make an external
   profession unless there be, at the same time, truth in the inward man.
   What he says concerning the tabernacle of the covenant must be applied
   to the continual government of the church.

   4. He who is clean of hands, and pure of heart. Under the purity of the
   hands and of the heart, and the reverence of God's name, he comprehends
   all religion, and denotes a well ordered life. True purity, no doubt,
   has its seat in the heart, but it manifests its fruits in the works of
   the hands. The Psalmist, therefore, very properly joins to a pure heart
   the purity of the whole life; for that man acts a ridiculous part who
   boasts of having a sound heart, if he does not show by his fruits that
   the root is good. On the other hand, it will not suffice to frame the
   hands, feet, and eyes, according to the rule of righteousness, unless
   purity of heart precede outward continence. If any man should think it
   absurd that the first place is given to the hands, we answer without
   hesitation, that effects are often named before their causes, not that
   they precede them in order, but because it is sometimes advantageous to
   begin with things which are best known. David, then, would have the
   Jews to bring into the presence of God pure hands, and these along with
   an unfeigned heart. To lift up, or to take his soul, I have no doubt is
   here put for to swear. It is, therefore, here required of the servants
   of God, that when they swear, they do it with reverence and in good
   conscience, [545] and, under one particular, by synecdoche, is denoted
   the duty of observing fidelity and integrity in all the affairs of
   life. That mention is here made of oaths, appears from the words which
   immediately follow, And hath not sworn deceitfully, which are added as
   explanatory of what goes before. As, however, there is a twofold
   reading of the Hebrew word for soul, that is to say, as it may be read,
   my soul, or his soul, on account of the point hirek, some Jewish
   commentators read, Who hath not lifted up my soul to vanity, [546] and
   understand the word my as spoken of God, an exposition which I reject
   as harsh and strained. It is a manner of speaking which carries in it
   great emphasis, for it means, that those who swear offer their souls as
   pledges to God. Some, however, may perhaps prefer the opinion, that to
   lift up the soul, is put for to apply it to lying, an interpretation to
   the adoption of which I have no great objection, for it makes little
   difference as to the sense. A question may here be raised -- it may be
   asked, why David does not say so much as one word concerning faith and
   calling upon God. The reason of this is easily explained. As it seldom
   happens that a man behaves himself uprightly and innocently towards his
   brethren, unless he is so endued with the true fear of God as to walk
   circumspectly before him, David very justly forms his estimate of the
   piety of men towards God by the character of their conduct towards
   their fellow-men. For the same reason, Christ (Matthew 23:23)
   represents judgment, mercy, and faith, as the principal points of the
   law; and Paul calls "charity" at one time "the end of the law," (1
   Timothy 1:5) and at another "the bond of perfection" (Colossians 3:14.)

   Psalm 24:5-6

   5. He shall receive blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness from the
   God of his salvation. 6. This is the generation of them that seek him,
   of them that seek thy face, O Jacob! [547] Selah.


   5. He shall receive blessing. The more effectually to move the minds of
   the Israelites, David declares that nothing is more desirable than to
   be numbered among the flock of God, and to be members of the church. We
   must here consider that there is an implied contrast between true
   Israelites and those of them who were degenerate and bastards. The more
   license the wicked give themselves, the more presumptuous are they in
   pretending to the name of God, as if he were under obligation to them,
   because they are adorned with the same outward symbols or badges as
   true believers. Accordingly, the demonstrative pronoun this, in the
   following verse, is of great weight, for it expressly excludes all that
   bastard generation which gloried only in the mask of external
   ceremonies. And in this verse, when he speaks of blessing, he intimates
   that it is not those who boast of being the servants of God, while they
   have only the name, who shall be partakers of the promised blessing,
   but those only who answer to their calling with their whole heart, and
   without hypocrisy. It is, as we have already observed, a very powerful
   inducement to godliness and an upright life, when the faithful are
   assured that they do not lose their labor in following righteousness,
   since God has in reserve for them a blessing which cannot fail them.
   The word righteousness may be explained two ways. It either means all
   the benefits of God, by which he proves himself to be righteous and
   faithful towards his people in keeping his promises to them, or it
   denotes the fruit or reward of the believer's righteousness. Indeed,
   David's meaning is abundantly manifest. He intends to show on the one
   hand, that it is not to be expected that the fruit or reward of
   righteousness will be bestowed on those who unrighteously profane God's
   sacred worship; and on the other hand, that it is impossible for God to
   disappoint his true worshippers; for it is his peculiar office to give
   evidence of his righteousness by doing them good.

   6. This is the generation. I have just now observed, that by the
   demonstrative pronoun this, the Psalmist erases from the catalogue of
   the servants of God all counterfeit Israelites, who, trusting only to
   their circumcision and the sacrifices of beasts, have no concern about
   offering themselves to God; and yet, at the same time, they rashly
   thrust themselves into the church. Such persons may pretend to have
   delight in the service of God, by often coming to his temple, but they
   have no other design than to withdraw themselves from him as far as
   they can. Now, as nothing was more common in the mouths of each of them
   than to say, that they all belonged to the holy seed, the Psalmist has
   limited the name of holy generation to the true observers of the law;
   as if he had said, All who have sprung from Abraham, according to the
   flesh, are not, on that account, his legitimate children. It is, no
   doubt, truly said in many other places, as we shall see in [10]Psalm
   27, that those sought the face of God who, to testify their godliness,
   exercised themselves in the ceremonies before the ark of the covenant;
   that is to say, if they were brought thither by a pure and holy
   affection. But as hypocrites seek God externally in a certain way, as
   well as true saints, while yet they shun him by their windings and
   false pretences, [548] David here declares that God is not sought in
   truth unless there go before a zealous cultivation of holiness and
   righteousness. To give the sentence greater emphasis, he repeats it,
   using the second person, and addressing his discourse to God. [549] It
   is as if he summoned before the judgment-seat of God hypocrites, who
   account it nothing falsely to use the name of God before the world; and
   he thus teaches us, that whatever they may say in their empty talk
   among men, the judgment of God will be a very different matter. He adds
   the word Jacob, for the confirmation of the same doctrine putting it
   for those who were descended from Jacob; as if he had said, Although
   circumcision distinguishes all the seed of Jacob according to the flesh
   from the Gentiles, yet we can only distinguish the chosen people by the
   fear and reverence of God, as Christ said, "Behold an Israelite indeed,
   in whom is no guile!" (John 1:47.)

   Psalm 24:7-10

   7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates! and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
   doors! and the King of glory shall enter in. 8. Who is this King of
   glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. 9. Lift up
   your heads, O ye gates! Be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors! and the
   King of glory shall enter in. 10. Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of
   hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.


   7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates! The magnificent and splendid
   structure of the temple, in which there was more outward majesty than
   in the tabernacle, not being yet erected, David here speaks of the
   future building of it. By doing this, he encourages the pious
   Israelites to employ themselves more willingly, and with greater
   confidence, in the ceremonial observances of the law. It was no
   ordinary token of the goodness of God that he condescended to dwell in
   the midst of them by a visible symbol of his presence, and was willing
   that his heavenly dwelling-place should be seen upon earth. This
   doctrine ought to be of use to us at this day; for it is an instance of
   the inestimable grace of God, that so far as the infirmity of our flesh
   will permit, we are lifted up even to God by the exercises of religion.
   What is the design of the preaching of the word, the sacraments, the
   holy assemblies, and the whole external government of the church, but
   that we may be united to God? It is not, therefore, without good reason
   that David extols so highly the service of God appointed in the law,
   seeing God exhibited himself to his saints in the ark of the covenant,
   and thereby gave them a certain pledge of speedy succor whenever they
   should invoke him for aid. God, it is true, "dwelleth not in temples
   made with hands," nor does he take delight in outward pomp; but as it
   was useful, and as it was also the pleasure of God, that his ancient
   people, who were rude, and still in their infancy, should be lifted up
   to him by earthly elements, David does not here hesitate to set forth
   to them, for the confirmation of their faith, the sumptuous building of
   the temple, to assure them that it was not a useless theater; but that
   when they rightly worshipped God in it, according to the appointment of
   his word, they stood as it were in his presence, and would actually
   experience that he was near them. The amount of what is stated is, that
   in proportion as the temple which God had commanded to be built to him
   upon mount Sion, surpassed the tabernacle in magnificence, it would be
   so much the brighter a mirror of the glory and power of God dwelling
   among the Jews. In the meantime, as David himself burned with intense
   desire for the erection of the temple, so he wished to inflame the
   hearts of all the godly with the same ardent desire, that, aided by the
   rudiments of the law, they might make more and more progress in the
   fear of God. He terms the gates, everlasting, because the promise of
   God secured their continual stability. The temple excelled in materials
   and in workmanship, but its chief excellence consisted in this, that
   the promise of God was engraven upon it, as we shall see in Psalm
   132:14, "This is my rest for ever." In terming the gates everlasting,
   the Psalmist, at the same time, I have no doubt, makes a tacit contrast
   between the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle never had any
   certain abiding place, but being from time to time transported from one
   place to another, was like a wayfaring man. When, however, mount Sion
   was chosen, and the temple built, God then began to have there a
   certain and fixed place of abode. By the coming of Christ, that visible
   shadow vanished, and it is therefore not wonderful that the temple is
   no longer to be seen upon mount Sion, seeing it is now so great as to
   occupy the whole world. If it is objected, that at the time of the
   Babylonish captivity the gates which Solomon had built were demolished,
   I answer, God's decree stood fast, notwithstanding that temporary
   overthrow; and by virtue of it, the temple was soon after rebuilt;
   which was the same as if it had always continued entire. The Septuagint
   has from ignorance corrupted this passage. [550] The Hebrew word r'sym,
   rashim, which we have rendered heads, is no doubt sometimes taken
   metaphorically for princes; but the word your, which is here annexed to
   it, sufficiently shows that we cannot draw from it another sense than
   this -- that the gates lift up their heads, otherwise we must say, Your
   princes. Some, therefore, think that kings and magistrates are here
   admonished of their duty, which is to open up the way, and give
   entrance to God. This is a plausible interpretation, but it is too much
   removed from the design and words of the prophet. Above all, from the
   natural sense of the words, we may perceive how foolishly and basely
   the Papists have abused this passage for the confirmation of the gross
   and ridiculous notion by which they introduce Christ as knocking at the
   gate of the infernal regions, in order to obtain admission. [551] Let
   us, therefore, learn from this, to handle the holy word of God with
   sobriety and reverence, and to hold Papists in detestation, who, as it
   were, make sport of corrupting and falsifying it in this manner, by
   their execrable impieties. [552]

   8. Who is this King of glory? etc The praises by which the power of God
   is here magnified are intended to tell the Jews that he did not sit
   idle in his temple, but took up his abode in it, in order to show
   himself ready to succor his people. It is to be observed, that there is
   great weight both in the interrogation, and in the repetition of the
   same sentence. The prophet assumes the person of one who wonders
   thereby to express with greater effect that God comes armed with
   invincible power to maintain and save his people, and to keep the
   faithful in safety under his shadow. We have already said, that when
   God is spoken of as dwelling in the temple, it is not to be understood
   as if his infinite and incomprehensible essence had been shut up or
   confined within it; but that he was present there by his power and
   grace, as is implied in the promise which he made to Moses,

   "In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I
   will bless thee," (Exodus 20:24.)

   That this was no vain and empty promise, but that God truly dwelt in
   the midst of the people, is what the faithful experienced who sought
   him not superstitiously, as if he had been fixed to the temple, but
   made use of the temple and of the service which was performed in it for
   elevating their hearts to heaven. The amount of what is stated is, that
   whenever the people should call upon God in the temple, it would
   manifestly appear, from the effect which would follow, that the ark of
   the covenant was not a vain and an illusory symbol of the presence of
   God, because he would always stretch forth his omnipotent arm for the
   defense and protection of his people. The repetition teaches us that
   true believers cannot be too constant and diligent in meditation on
   this subject. The Son of God, clothed with our flesh, has now shown
   himself to be King of glory and Lord of hosts, and he is not entered
   into his temple only by shadows and figures, but really and in very
   deed, that he may dwell in the midst of us. There is, therefore,
   nothing to hinder us from boasting that we shall be invincible by his
   power. Mount Sion, it is true, is not at this day the place appointed
   for the sanctuary, and the ark of the covenant is no longer the image
   or representation of God dwelling between the cherubim; but as we have
   this privilege in common with the fathers, that, by the preaching of
   the word and the sacraments, we may be united to God, it becomes us to
   use these helps with reverence; for if we despise them by a detestable
   pride, God cannot but at length utterly withdraw himself from us.

   [550] The Septuagint reads, Arate pulas hoi archontes humon, which may
   be rendered, "Ye princes, lift up your gates." The reading of the
   Vulgate is similar: "Attollite portas principes vestras" and so is that
   of the Arabic and Ethiopic. But that rendering, as Calvin justly
   observes, inadmissible; for in the Hebrew text, the affix km, kem,
   your, is joined to r'sy, roshey, heads, and not to srym, shearim,
   gates. Although, however the reading of the Septuagint may be
   translated as above, "Ye princes, lift up your gates," Hammond thinks
   it more probable, that the translators intended hoi archontes humon,
   your princes, to represent r'sykm, rashekem, as myertin, by mistake,
   the construction of the sentence, so your heads, as to give this
   reading, "Your heads, or princes, lift up the gates, instead of, "Ye
   gates, lift up your heads."

   PSALM 25.

   This psalm consists of meditations mingled with prayers. Being rudely
   treated, and grievously distressed, by the cruelty of his enemies,
   David, in order to obtain assistance from God, first acknowledges that
   God had justly made use of this as a means of chastising and punishing
   him for his sins; and, therefore, he prays for their forgiveness, that
   he may at once enjoy assurance of the divine favor, and obtain
   deliverance. He then implores the aid of the Holy Spirit, that,
   sustained by it, he might, even in the midst of so many temptations,
   continue in the fear of God. And in various places he intermingles
   meditation, as the means of stirring up himself to increased confidence
   in God, and of withdrawing his thoughts from the allurements of the
   world.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 25:1-3

   1. Unto thee, O Jehovah! I have lifted up my soul 2. O my God! I have
   put my trust in thee; let me not be ashamed; let not mine enemies
   rejoice over me. 3. Yea, none of those that wait on thee shall be
   ashamed; but they shall be ashamed that deal falsely without cause.


   1. Unto thee, O Jehovah! etc The Psalmist declares at the very outset,
   that he is not driven hither and thither, after the manner of the
   ungodly, but that he directs all his desires and prayers to God alone.
   Nothing is more inconsistent with true and sincere prayer to God, than
   to waver and gaze about as the heathen do, for some help from the
   world; and at the same time to forsake God, or not to betake ourselves
   directly to his guardianship and protection. Those who imagine that
   David here declares that he had devoted himself entirely to God, as if
   he had offered up himself in sacrifice, do not properly understand the
   import of the passage. The meaning rather is, that in order to
   strengthen the hope of obtaining his request, he declares, what is of
   the greatest importance in prayer, that he had his hope fixed in God,
   and that he was not ensnared by the allurements of the world, or
   prevented from lifting up his soul fully and unfeignedly to God. In
   order, therefore, that we may pray aright to God, let us be directed by
   this rule -- not to distract our minds by various and uncertain hopes,
   nor to depend on worldly aid, but to yield to God the honor of lifting
   up our hearts to him in sincere and earnest prayer. Moreover, although
   the verb is properly rendered, I will lift up, yet I have followed
   other interpreters in changing it into the past tense, I have lifted up
   By the future tense, however, David denotes a continued act.

   2. O my God! I have put my trust in thee. By this verse we learn, (what
   will appear more clearly afterwards,) that David had to do with men;
   but as he was persuaded that his enemies were, as it were, the scourges
   of God, he with good reason asks that God would restrain them by his
   power, lest they should become more insolent, and continue, to exceed
   all bounds. By the word trust he confirms what he had just said of the
   lifting up of his soul to God; for the term is employed either as
   descriptive of the way in which the souls of the faithful are lifted
   up, or else faith and hope are added as the cause of such an effect,
   namely, the lifting up of the soul. And, indeed, these are the wings by
   which our souls, rising above this world, are lifted up to God. David,
   then, was carried upward to God with the whole desire of his heart,
   because, trusting to his promises, he thereby hoped for sure salvation.
   When he asks that God would not suffer him to be put to shame, he
   offers up a prayer which is taken from the ordinary doctrine of
   Scripture, namely, that they who trust in God shall never be ashamed.
   The reason which is added, and which he here pleads, to induce God to
   have pity upon him, ought also to be noticed. It is this, that he might
   not be exposed to the derision of his enemies, whose pride is no less
   hurtful to the feelings of the godly than it is displeasing to God.

   3. Yea, none of those, etc. If these words should be explained in the
   form of a desire, as if David had said, Let none who wait on thee be
   put to shame, [553] then, in this verse, he continues his prayer, and
   extends to all the faithful in common what he had spoken of himself
   alone. But I am rather inclined to understand the words in a different
   sense, and to view them as meaning that David shows the fruit of divine
   grace which should proceed from his deliverance. And there is peculiar
   force in the word yea; for as he knew that he was seen by many, and
   that the report of his confidence in God was widely spread, his meaning
   is, that what shall be done in his person shall extend far and wide, as
   an example to others, and shall have the effect of reviving and
   animating all the children of God, on the one hand, and of casting to
   the ground the arrogance of the wicked, on the other. The words might
   also be understood in another sense, namely, that David, for the
   strengthening of his faith, sets before himself a promise which God
   frequently makes in his word. But the sense in which I have interpreted
   them seems to be more suitable. By the wicked that deal falsely without
   cause, he no doubt means especially his enemies. Accordingly, he
   declares that when he is delivered he will not enjoy exclusively the
   benefit of it; but that its fruit shall extend to all true believers;
   just as on the other hand, the faith of many would have been shaken if
   he had been forsaken of God. In the last clause of the verse, which he
   puts in opposition to the first, he argues that when the wicked lie
   confounded, it redounds to the glory of God, because the vaunting in
   which they indulge in their prosperity is an open mockery of God,
   while, in despite of his judgment, they break forth more boldly in
   doing evil. When he adds, without cause, it only tends to show the
   aggravated nature of the offense. The wickedness of a man is always the
   more intolerable, when, unprovoked by wrongs, he sets himself, of his
   own accord, to injure the innocent and blameless.

   Psalm 25:4-7

   4. O Jehovah! make me to know thy ways, and teach me thy paths. 5. Lead
   me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation: I
   have waited for thee all the day. 6. Remember, O Jehovah! thy tender
   mercies and thy loving-kindnesses, for they have been from everlasting.
   7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according
   to thy compassion, and for the sake of thy goodness, O Jehovah! do thou
   remember me.


   4. O Jehovah! make me to know thy ways. By the ways of the Lord, David
   sometimes means, as we have seen in another place, the happy and
   prosperous issue of affairs, but more frequently he uses this
   expression to denote the rule of a holy and righteous life. As the term
   truth occurs in the immediately following verse, the prayer which he
   offers up in this place is, in my opinion, to this effect: Lord, keep
   thy servant in the firm persuasion of thy promises, and do not suffer
   him to turn aside to the right hand or to the left. When our minds are
   thus composed to patience, we undertake nothing rashly or by improper
   means, but depend wholly upon the providence of God. Accordingly, in
   this place David desires not merely to be directed by the Spirit of
   God, lest he should err from the right way, but also that God would
   clearly manifest to him his truth and faithfulness in the promises of
   his word, that he might live in peace before him, and be free from all
   impatience. [554] If any one would rather take the words in a general
   sense, as if David committed himself wholly to God to be governed by
   him, I do not object to it. As, however, I think it probable, that,
   under the name of truth in the next verse, he explains what he means by
   the ways and paths of God, of which he here speaks, I have no
   hesitation in referring the prayer to this circumstance, namely, that
   David, afraid of yielding to the feeling of impatience, or the desire
   of revenge, or some extravagant and unlawful impulse, asks that the
   promises of God may be deeply impressed and engraven on his heart. For
   I have said before, that as long as this thought prevails in our minds,
   that God takes care of us, it is the best and most powerful means for
   resisting temptations. If, however, by the ways and paths of God, any
   would rather understand his doctrine, I, nevertheless, still hold this
   as a settled point, that in the language of the Psalmist there is an
   allusion to those sudden and irregular emotions which arise in our
   minds when we are tossed by adversity, and by which we are precipitated
   into the devious and deceitful paths of error, till they are in due
   time subdued or allayed by the word of God. Thus the meaning is,
   Whatever may happen, suffer me not, O Lord, to fall from thy ways, or
   to be carried away by a wilful disobedience to thy authority, or any
   other sinful desire; but rather let thy truth preserve me in a state of
   quiet repose and peace, by an humble submission to it. Moreover,
   although he frequently repeats the same thing, asking that God would
   make him to know his ways, and teach him in them, and lead him in his
   truth, there is no redundancy in these forms of speech. Our adversities
   are often like mists which darken the eyes; and every one knows from
   his own experience how difficult a thing it is, while these clouds of
   darkness continue, to discern in what way we ought to walk. But if
   David, so distinguished a prophet and endued with so much wisdom, stood
   in need of divine instruction, what shall become of us if, in our
   afflictions, God dispel not from our minds those clouds of darkness
   which prevent us from seeing his light? As often, then, as any
   temptation may assail us, we ought always to pray that God would make
   the light of his truth to shine upon us, lest, by having recourse to
   sinful devices, we should go astray, and wander into devious and
   forbidden paths.

   At the same time, we ought to observe the argument which David here
   employs to enforce his prayer. By calling God the God of his salvation,
   he does so in order to strengthen his hope in God for the future, from
   a consideration of the benefits which he had already received from him;
   and then he repeats the testimony of his confidence towards God. Thus
   the first part of the argument is taken from the nature of God himself,
   and the duty which, as it were, belongs to him; that is to say, because
   he engages to maintain the welfare of the godly, and aids them in their
   necessities, on this ground, that he will continue to manifest the same
   favor towards them even to the end. But as it is necessary that our
   confidence in God should correspond to his great goodness towards us,
   David alleges it, at the same time, in connection with a declaration of
   his perseverance. For, by the expression all the day, or every day, he
   signifies that with a fixed and untiring constancy he depended upon God
   alone. And, doubtless, it is the property of faith always to look to
   God, even in the most trying circumstances, and patiently to wait for
   the aid which he has promised. That the recollection of the divine
   blessings may nourish and sustain our hope, let us learn to reflect
   upon the goodness which God has already manifested towards us, as we
   see that David did in making this the ground of his confidence, that he
   had found in his own personal experience God to be the author of
   salvation.

   6. Remember, O Jehovah; From this it appears, in the first place, that
   David was grievously afflicted and tried, so much so that he had lost
   all sense of God's mercy: for he calls upon God to remember for him his
   favor, in such a manner as if he had altogether forgotten it. This,
   therefore, is the complaint of a man suffering extreme anguish, and
   overwhelmed with grief. We may learn from this, that although God, for
   a time, may withdraw from us every token of his goodness, and,
   apparently regardless of the miseries which afflict us, should, as if
   we were strangers to him, and not his own people, forsake us, we must
   fight courageously, until, set free from this temptation, we cordially
   present the prayer which is here recorded, beseeching God, that,
   returning to his former manner of dealing, he would again begin to
   manifest his goodness towards us, and to deal with us in a more
   gracious manner. This form of prayer cannot be used with propriety,
   unless when God is hiding his face from us, and seems to take no
   interest at all in us. Moreover David, by having recourse to the mercy
   or compassion and goodness of God, testifies that he trusts not to his
   own merit as any ground of hope. He who derives every thing from the
   fountain of divine mercy alone, finds nothing in himself entitled to
   recompense in the sight of God. But as the intermission which David had
   experienced was an obstacle which prevented his free access to God, he
   rises above it, by the very best remedy -- the consideration, that
   although God, who from his very nature is merciful, may withdraw
   himself, and cease for a time to manifest his power, yet he cannot deny
   himself; that is to say, he cannot divest himself of the feeling of
   mercy which is natural to him, and which can no more cease than his
   eternal existence. But we must firmly maintain this doctrine, that God
   has been merciful even from the beginning, so that if at any time he
   seem to act with severity towards us, and to reject our prayers, we
   must not imagine that he acts contrary to his real character, or that
   he has changed his purpose. Hence we learn for what end it is that the
   Scriptures every where inform us, that in all ages God has regarded his
   servants with a benignant eye, and exercised his mercy towards them.
   [555] This, at least, we ought to regard as a fixed and settled point,
   that although the goodness of God may sometimes be hidden, and as it
   were buried out of sight, it can never be extinguished.

   7. Remember not the sins of my youth. As our sins are like a wall
   between us and God, which prevents him from hearing our prayers, or
   stretching forth his hand to help us, David now removes this
   obstruction. It is indeed true, in general, that men pray in a wrong
   way, and in vain, unless they begin by seeking the forgiveness of their
   sins. There is no hope of obtaining any favor from God unless he is
   reconciled to us. How shall he love us unless he first freely reconcile
   us to himself? The right and proper order of prayer therefore is, as I
   have said, to ask, at the very outset, that God would pardon our sins.
   David here acknowledges, in explicit terms, that he cannot in any other
   way become a partaker of the grace of God than by having his sins
   blotted out. In order, therefore, that God may be mindful of his mercy
   towards us, it is necessary that he forget our sins, the very sight of
   which turns away his favor from us. In the meantime, the Psalmist
   confirms by this more clearly what I have already said, that although
   the wicked acted towards him with cruelty, and persecuted him unjustly,
   yet he ascribed to his own sins all the misery which he endured. For
   why should he ask the forgiveness of his sins, by having recourse to
   the mercy of God, but because he acknowledged, that by the cruel
   treatment he received from his enemies, he only suffered the punishment
   which he justly merited? He has, therefore, acted wisely in turning his
   thoughts to the first cause of his misery, that he may find out the
   true remedy; and thus he teaches us by his example, that when any
   outward affliction presses upon us, we must entreat God not only to
   deliver us from it, but also to blot out our sins, by which we have
   provoked his displeasure, and subjected ourselves to his chastening
   rod. If we act otherwise, we shall follow the example of unskilful
   physicians, who, overlooking the cause of the disease, only seek to
   alleviate the pain, and apply merely adventitious remedies for the
   cure. Moreover, David makes confession not only of some slight
   offenses, as hypocrites are wont to do, who, by confessing their guilt
   in a general and perfunctory manner, either seek some subterfuge, or
   else extenuate the enormity of their sin; but he traces back his sins
   even to his very childhood, and considers in how many ways he had
   provoked the wrath of God against him. When he makes mention of the
   sins which he had committed in his youth, he does not mean by this that
   he had no remembrance of any of the sins which he had committed in his
   later years; but it is rather to show that he considered himself worthy
   of so much the greater condemnation. [556] In the first place,
   considering that he had not begun only of late to commit sin, but that
   he had for a long time heaped up sin upon sin, he bows himself, if we
   may so speak, under the accumulated load; and, in the second place, he
   intimates, that if God should deal with him according to the rigour of
   law, not only the sins of yesterday, or of a few days, would come into
   judgment against him, but all the instances in which he had offended,
   even from his infancy, might now with justice be laid to his charge. As
   often, therefore, as God terrifies us by his judgments and the tokens
   of his wrath, let us call to our remembrance, not only the sins which
   we have lately committed, but also all the transgressions of our past
   life, proving to us the ground of renewed shame and renewed
   lamentation. Besides, in order to express more fully that he
   supplicates a free pardon, he pleads before God only on the ground of
   his mere good pleasure; and therefore he says, According to thy
   compassion do thou remember me When God casts our sins into oblivion,
   this leads him to behold us with fatherly regard. David can discover no
   other cause by which to account for this paternal regard of God, but
   that he is good, and hence it follows that there is nothing to induce
   God to receive us into his favor but his own good pleasure. When God is
   said to remember us according to his mercy, we are tacitly given to
   understand that there are two ways of remembering which are entirely
   opposite; the one when he visits sinners in his wrath, and the other
   when he again manifests his favor to those of whom he seemed for a time
   to take no account.

   Psalm 25:8-11

   8. Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore will he teach sinners in the
   way. 9. He will guide the poor in judgment, and will teach the poor
   [557] his way. 10. All the ways of Jehovah are mercy and truth, to
   those who keep his covenant and his testimony. 11. For thy name's sake,
   O Jehovah! be thou merciful to mine iniquity, for it is great.


   8. Good and upright is Jehovah. Pausing for a little as it were in the
   prosecution of his prayer, he exercises his thoughts in meditation upon
   the goodness of God, that he may return with renewed ardor to prayer.
   The faithful feel that their hearts soon languish in prayer, unless
   they are constantly stirring themselves up to it by new incitements; so
   rare and difficult a thing is it to persevere steadfastly and
   unweariedly in this duty. And, indeed, as one must frequently lay on
   fuel in order to preserve a fire, so the exercise of prayer requires
   the aid of such helps, that it may not languish, and at length be
   entirely extinguished. David, therefore, desirous to encourage himself
   to perseverance, speaks to himself, and affirms that God is good and
   upright, that, gathering new strength by meditating on this truth, he
   may return with the more alacrity to prayer. But we must observe this
   consequence -- that as God is good and upright, he stretches forth his
   hand to sinners to bring them back again into the way. To attribute to
   God an uprightness which he may exercise only towards the worthy and
   the meritorious, is a cold view of his character, and of little
   advantage to sinners, and yet the world commonly apprehends that God is
   good in no other sense. How comes it to pass that scarcely one in a
   hundred applies to himself the mercy of God, if it is not because men
   limit it to those who are worthy of it? No on the contrary, it is here
   said, that God gives a proof of his uprightness when he shows to
   transgressors the way; and this is of the same import as to call them
   to repentance, and to teach them to live uprightly. And, indeed, if the
   goodness of God did not penetrate even to hell, no man would ever
   become a partaker of it. Let the Papists then boast as they please of
   their imaginary preparations, but let us regard this as a sure and
   certain doctrine, that if God do not prevent men by his grace, they
   shall all utterly perish. David, therefore, here commends this
   preventing grace, as it is called, which is manifested either when God
   in calling us at first renews, by the Spirit of regeneration, our
   corrupt nature, or when he brings us back again into the right way,
   after we have gone astray from him by our sins. For since even those
   whom God receives for his disciples are here called sinners, it follows
   that he renews them by his Holy Spirit that they may become docile and
   obedient.

   9. He will guide the poor in judgment. The Psalmist here specifies the
   second manifestation of his grace which God makes towards those who,
   being subdued by his power, and brought under his yoke, bear it
   willingly, and submit themselves to his government. But never will this
   docility be found in any man, until the heart, which is naturally
   elated and filled with pride, has been humbled and subdued. As the
   Hebrew word nvym, anavim, denotes the poor or afflicted, and is
   employed in a metaphorical sense, to denote the meek and humble, it is
   probable that David, under this term, includes the afflictions which
   serve to restrain and subdue the frowardness of the flesh, as well as
   the grace of humility itself; as if he had said, When God has first
   humbled them, then he kindly stretches forth his hand to them, and
   leads and guides them throughout the whole course of their life.
   Moreover, some understand these terms, judgment and way of the Lord, as
   denoting a righteous and well ordered manner of life. Others refer them
   to the providence of God, an interpretation which seems more correct,
   and more agreeable to the context, for it is immediately added, All the
   ways of Jehovah are mercy and truth. The meaning therefore is, that
   those who are truly humbled in their hearts, and brought to place their
   confidence in God, shall experience how much care he has for his
   children, [558] and how well he provides for their necessities. The
   terms, judgment and way of the Lord, therefore, are simply of the same
   import in this place as his government, in the exercise of which he
   shows that he, as a kind father, has a special interest in the welfare
   of his children, by relieving them when they are oppressed, raising
   them up when cast down, cheering and comforting them when sorrowful,
   and succouring them when afflicted. We perceive, then, by what order
   God proceeds in the manifestation of his grace towards us. First, he
   brings us again into the way when we are wandering and going astray
   from him, or rather, when we are already fugitives and exiles from him,
   he restrains our frowardness; and whereas we were before froward and
   rebellious, he now subdues us to the obedience of his righteousness:
   and, secondly, after he has afflicted and tried us, he does not forsake
   us; but after he has moulded and trained us by the cross to humility
   and meekness, he still shows himself to be a wise and provident father
   in guiding and directing us through life.

   10. All the ways of Jehovah. This verse is erroneously interpreted by
   those who think that the doctrine of the law is here described as true
   and sweet, and that those who keep it feel it indeed to be so, as if
   this passage were of the same import as that which was spoken by Jesus
   Christ,

   "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
   (Matthew 11:30)

   Such an interpretation is not only strained, but may also be easily
   disproved by many similar passages in which the expression, The ways of
   the Lord, is taken in a passive signification, for the paternal manner
   in which he acts towards those who are his people, in defending and
   cherishing them; nay, even for his whole conduct in the government and
   direction of the affairs of this world. The amount of what is said is,
   that God acts in such a manner towards his people, as that, in all
   respects, they may find from experience that he is merciful and
   faithful. David is not here speaking of the character in which God acts
   towards mankind in general, but what his own children find him to be.
   We have already seen in Psalm 18:26, that he is stern and severe
   towards the obstinate and rebellious; and even though he act with
   kindness towards them, in mercifully exercising forbearance towards
   them notwithstanding their iniquity, yet we find, that so far from
   seeking their full enjoyment in him, and trusting to his promises, they
   have no sense of his goodness. Nay, as soon as any adversity befalls
   them, they either become passionate and fretful, accuse God of acting
   cruelly towards them, or else complain that he is deaf to their
   prayers; and when they enjoy prosperity, they despise and neglect him,
   and as much as they are able flee from his presence. David, therefore,
   in speaking of the mercy and faithfulness of God, justly describes them
   as a treasure peculiar to the godly; as if he had said, We have no
   reason to be afraid that God will deceive us if we persevere in his
   covenant. These words, covenant and testimony, are of the same import,
   unless that the second is added as an explanation of the first. They
   comprehend the whole doctrine of the law, by which God enters into
   covenant with his chosen people.

   11. For thy name's sake, O Jehovah! As in the original text the
   copulative and is inserted between the two clauses of this verse, some
   think that the first clause is incomplete, and that some word ought to
   be supplied; and then they read these words, Be thou merciful to mine
   iniquity, etc., as a distinct sentence by itself. And thus, according
   to their opinion, the sense would be, Lord, although I have not fully
   kept thy covenant, yet do not on that account cease to show thy
   kindness towards me; and that mine iniquity may not prevent thy
   goodness from being extended towards me, do thou graciously pardon it.
   But I am rather of the opinion of others, who consider that the
   copulative is here, as it is in many other places, superfluous, so that
   the whole verse may form one connected sentence. As to the tense of the
   verb, there is also a diversity of opinion among interpreters. Some
   render it in the past tense thus, Thou hast been merciful, as if David
   here renders thanks to God because he had pardoned his sin. But the
   other interpretation, which is the one more generally received, is also
   the most correct, namely, that David, in order to obtain pardon, again
   resorts to the mercy of God as his only refuge. The letter v, vau,
   which is equivalent to and, has often the force of changing the tense
   in the Hebrew verbs, so that the future tense is often taken in the
   sense of the optative. Moreover, I connect this verse with the
   preceding one in this way: The prophet, having reflected upon this,
   that God is kind and faithful to those who serve him, now examines his
   own heart, and acknowledges that he cannot be accounted of their
   number, unless God grant unto him the forgiveness of his sins; and,
   therefore, he betakes himself to prayer for pardon: as in Psalm 19:13,
   after having spoken of the reward which is laid up for the faithful who
   keep the law, he instantly exclaims, "Who can understand his errors?"
   Accordingly, although David is not ignorant that God promises liberally
   to bestow upon those who keep his covenant every thing which pertains
   to a life of happiness, yet, at the same time, considering how far he
   is as yet from the perfect righteousness of the law, he does not rest
   his confidence upon it, but seeks a remedy for the manifold offenses of
   which he feels himself to be guilty. And thus, in order that God may
   reckon us of the number of his servants, we ought always to come to
   him, entreating him, after the example of David, in his fatherly
   loving-kindness, to bear with our infirmities, because, without the
   free remission of our sins, we have no reason to expect any reward of
   our works. At the same time, let it be observed, that in order to show
   more distinctly that he depends entirely upon the free grace of God, he
   expressly says, for thy name's sake; meaning by this, that God, as
   often as he vouchsafes to pardon his people, does so from no other
   cause than his own good pleasure; just as he had said a little before,
   in the same verse, for thy goodness' sake. He was also constrained, by
   a consideration of the magnitude of his offense, to call upon the name
   of God: for he immediately adds, by way of confession, because mine
   iniquity is great, or manifold, (for the word rv, rab, may be
   translated in both ways;) as if he had said, My sins are, indeed, like
   a heavy burden which overwhelms me, so that the multitude or enormity
   of them might well deprive me of all hope of pardon; but, Lord, the
   infinite glory of thy name will not suffer thee to cast me off.

   Psalm 25:12-15

   12. Who is the man that feareth Yehovah, he will teach him, in the way
   that he should choose. 13. His soul shalt dwell in good, and his seed
   shall inherit the earth. 14. The counsel [559] of Jehovah is towards
   them that fear him, that he may make known his covenant to them. 15.
   Mine eyes are continually towards Jehovah, for he will bring my feet
   out of the net.


   12. Who is the man. By again recalling to his mind the character in
   which God manifests himself towards his servants, he derives new
   strength and courage. For we have said, that nothing more readily
   occurs than a relaxation in earnest and attentive prayer, unless it be
   sustained by the recollection of God's promises. There can, however, be
   no doubt, that David both accuses himself, and by entertaining a better
   hope, takes encouragement to continue in the fear of God. In the first
   place, by intimating that men are destitute of right understanding and
   sound judgment, because they yield not themselves to be governed by God
   with reverence and fear, he imputes it to his own indolence, that by
   reason of the darkness of his mind, he had wandered so far astray after
   his own lusts; and yet, on the other hand, he promises himself the
   guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit, if he only yield himself
   wholly to God, and show that he is willing to learn. Moreover, the
   interrogatory style of speaking, which he here employs, seems designed
   to show how few there are who fear God: for, although all men in
   general pray, and manifest some appearance of piety, yet where is there
   one among so many who is really in earnest? Instead of this, almost all
   men indulge themselves in their own drowsiness. The fear of God,
   therefore, is very rare; and on this account it is that the world, for
   the most part, continues destitute of the Spirit of counsel and wisdom.

   Some interpreters render the word choose in the present tense, instead
   of the future, shall choose; as if it had been said, that God shows the
   way which he approves, and in which he wishes men to walk. With this
   interpretation I cannot agree; for, in my judgment, the word choose
   rather refers to every individual; as if it had been said, Provided we
   are disposed to fear God, he will not be wanting on his part, but will
   always direct us by the Spirit of wisdom to choose the right way. When
   we are called upon to adopt some particular course in life, we find
   ourselves as it were placed between two ways, and know not which of
   them to follow; [560] nay, in almost all our affairs we are held in
   suspense and doubt, unless God appear to show us the way. David
   therefore says, that although men know not what is right, and what they
   ought to choose, yet provided they submit to God with pious docility of
   mind, and are willing to follow him, he will always manifest himself
   towards them as a sure and faithful guide. As, however, the fear of God
   is not naturally in us, it were foolish for any man to argue from this
   place, that God does not begin to take care of men until, by their own
   previous efforts, they insinuate themselves into his favor, that he may
   aid them in their pious endeavors. David has just declared, that this
   grace comes directly from God, when he says that God teaches the
   transgressors: and now he adds, in the second place, that after men
   have once been subdued and moulded to meekness of spirit, God still
   takes them under his charge, guiding and directing them till they are
   able, by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, to know what is their
   duty.

   13. His soul shall dwell in good. If the supreme felicity of man
   consists in undertaking or attempting nothing except by the warrant of
   God, it follows that it is also a high and incomparable benefit to have
   him for our conductor and guide through life, that we may never go
   astray. But, in addition to this, an earthly blessing is here promised,
   in which the fruit of the preceding grace is distinctly shown, as Paul
   also teaches,

   "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life
   that now is, and of that which is to come." (1 Timothy 4:8,)

   The sum is, that those who truly serve God are not only blessed as to
   spiritual things, but are also blessed by him as to their condition in
   the present life. It is indeed true, that God does not always deal with
   them according to their desires, and that the blessings which they
   would wish do not always flow in a certain and uniform manner. On the
   contrary, it often happens that they are tossed with sickness and
   trouble, whilst the wicked enjoy prosperity. But we must know, that as
   often as God withdraws his blessing from his own people, it is for the
   purpose of awakening them to a sense of their condition, and
   discovering to them how far removed they still are from the perfect
   fear of God. And yet, in so far as it is expedient for them, they now
   enjoy the blessings of God, so that, in comparison of worldly men, and
   the despisers of God, they are truly happy and blessed, because, even
   in their greatest poverty, they never lose the assurance that God is
   present with them; and being sustained by this consolation, they enjoy
   peace and tranquillity of mind. It is indeed true, that all our
   miseries proceed from this one source -- that by our sins we prevent
   the divine blessing from flowing down in a uniform course upon us; and
   yet, amidst such a state of confusion, his grace never ceases to shine
   forth, so that the condition of the godly is always better than that of
   others: for although they are not satiated with good things, yet they
   are continually made to experience a sense of the fatherly favor of
   God. And to this I am willing to refer the word soul, namely, that, in
   the reception of the gifts of God, they do not devour them without
   feeling a sense of their sweetness, but really relish them, so that the
   smallest competency is of more avail to satisfy them than the greatest
   abundance is to satisfy the ungodly. Thus, according as every man is
   contented with his condition, and cheerfully cherishes a spirit of
   patience and tranquillity, his soul is said to dwell in good. Some
   interpreters apply this word to dwell or abide to the time of death;
   but this interpretation is more subtle than solid. The inspired penman
   rather speaks, as we have already said, of the condition of the present
   life. [561] He adds, in the second place, by way of illustration, that
   the posterity of the faithful shall inherit the land, and from this it
   follows, that God continues to extend his favor towards them. Hence we
   may again infer, that the death of God's servants does not imply their
   utter destruction, and that they do not cease to exist when they pass
   out of this world, but continue to live for ever. It would be absurd to
   suppose that God would totally deprive of life those for whose sake he
   does good even to others. As to what is here said, that the children of
   the saints shall inherit the land, it has been touched upon elsewhere,
   and it will be shown still more fully on the thirty-seventh Psalm, in
   what respects, and how this is accomplished.

   14. The counsel of Jehovah. The Psalmist here confirms what he had just
   said in a preceding verse, namely, that God will faithfully discharge
   the office of a teacher and master to all the godly; and, after his
   usual manner, he repeats the same sentiment twice in the same verse for
   the covenant of God is nothing else than his secret or counsel. By the
   use of the term secret, he means to magnify and extol the excellency of
   the doctrine which is revealed to us in the law of God. However much
   worldly men, through the pride and haughtiness of their hearts, despise
   Moses and the prophets, the faithful nevertheless acknowledge, that in
   the doctrine which they contain, the secrets of heaven, which far
   surpass the comprehension of man, are revealed and unfolded. Whoever,
   therefore, desires to derive instruction from the law, let him regard
   with reverence and esteem the doctrine which it contains. We are,
   farther, by this place admonished to cultivate the graces of meekness
   and humility, lest, in reliance upon our own wisdom, or trusting to our
   own understanding, we should attempt, by our own efforts, to comprehend
   those mysteries and secrets, the knowledge of which David here declares
   to be the prerogative of God alone. Again, since the fear of the Lord
   is said to be the beginning, and as it were the way that leads to a
   right understanding of his will, (Psalm 111:10,) according as any one
   desires to increase in faith, so also let him endeavor to advance in
   the fear of the Lord. Moreover, when piety reigns in the heart, we need
   have no fear of losing our labor in seeking God. It is indeed true,
   that the covenant of God is a secret which far exceeds human
   comprehension; but as we know that he does not in vain enjoin us to
   seek him, we may rest assured that all those who endeavor to serve him
   with an upright desire will be brought, by the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit, to the knowledge of that heavenly wisdom which is appointed for
   their salvation. But, in the meantime, David indirectly rebukes those
   who falsely and groundlessly boast that they are interested in the
   covenant of God, while they rest merely in the letter of the law, and
   have no saving impressions of the fear of God. God, it is true,
   addresses his word indiscriminately to the righteous and the wicked;
   but men do not comprehend it, unless they have sincere piety; just as
   Isaiah 29:11, says, that as regards the ungodly, the law is like "a
   book that is sealed." And, therefore, it is no wonder that there is
   here made a distinction between those who truly serve God, and to whom
   he makes known his secret, and the wicked or hypocrites. But when we
   see David in this confidence coming boldly to the school of God, and
   leading others along with him, let us know, as he clearly shows, that
   it is a wicked and hateful invention to attempt to deprive the common
   people of the Holy Scriptures, under the pretense of their being a
   hidden mystery; as if all who fear him from the heart, whatever their
   state or condition in other respects may be, were not expressly called
   to the knowledge of God's covenant.

   15. Mine eyes are continually towards Jehovah. David here speaks of his
   own faith, and of its perseverance, not in the way of boasting, but to
   encourage himself in the hope of obtaining his requests, so that he
   might give himself the more readily and cheerfully to prayer. As the
   promise is made to all who trust in God, that they shall not be
   disappointed of their hope, and that they shall never be put to shame,
   the saints often make this their shield of defense. Meanwhile, David
   shows to others, by his own example, the right manner of prayer,
   telling them that they should endeavor to keep their thoughts fixed
   upon God. As the sense of sight is very quick, and exercises an entire
   influence over the whole frame, it is no uncommon thing to find all the
   affections denoted by the term eyes. The reason which immediately
   follows shows still more plainly, that in the mind of David hope was
   associated with desire; as if he had said, That in resting his
   confidence in the help of God, he did so, not in doubt or uncertainty,
   but because he was persuaded that he would be his deliverer. The
   pronoun He, it ought to be observed, is also emphatic. It shows that
   David did not gaze around him in every direction, after the manner of
   those who, being in uncertainty, devise for themselves various methods
   of deliverance and salvation, but that he was contented with God alone.

   [561] Horsley refers the words to the blessedness of a future state. He
   reads, "His soul shall rest in bliss;" and has the following note: --
   "tlyk, pernoctavit. The words seem to allude to the happy state of the
   good man's departed soul, while his posterity prosper in the present
   world." That is, the land of Canaan, which God promised to perpetuate
   to the obedient Israelites and their posterity. "It was promised and
   given," says Poole, "as an earnest of the whole covenant of grace and
   all his promises, and, therefore, is synecdochically put for all of
   them. The sense is, his seed shall be blessed."

   Psalm 25:16-22

   16. Have respect unto me, and pity me, for I am alone and poor. 17. The
   troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring thou me out of my distresses.
   18. Look upon mine affliction and my trouble, [562] and take away all
   my sins. 19. Behold mine enemies, for they are increased; and they hate
   me with a violent [563] hatred. 20. Preserve my soul, and deliver me,
   that I may not be ashamed; for I have put my trust in thee. 21. Let
   integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I have waited upon thee. 22.
   Do thou, O God! redeem Israel from all his troubles.


   16. Have respect unto me. As the flesh is ever ready to suggest to our
   minds that God has forgotten us, when he ceases to manifest his power
   in aiding us, David here follows the order which nature dictates, in
   asking God to have respect unto him, as if he had altogether neglected
   him before. Now, it appears to me that the words might be explained
   thus: Have respect unto me, in order to pity me. He accounts it at once
   the cause and the source of his salvation to be regarded of God; and
   then he adds the effect of it: for as soon as God, of his own good
   pleasure, shall vouchsafe to regard us, his hand also will be ready to
   help us. Again, in order to excite the compassion of God, he sets forth
   his own misery, expressly stating that he is alone, that is to say,
   solitary; [564] and then he describes himself as poor. There can be no
   doubt that, in speaking thus, he alludes to the promises in which God
   declares that he will be always present with the afflicted and
   oppressed, to aid and help them.

   17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged. In this verse he
   acknowledges not only that he had to contend outwardly with his enemies
   and the troubles which they occasioned him, but that he was also
   afflicted inwardly with sorrow and anguish of heart. It is also
   necessary to observe the manner of expression which he here employs,
   and by which he intimates that the weight and number of his trials had
   accumulated to such an extent that they filled his whole heart, even as
   a flood of waters bursting every barrier, and extending far and wide,
   covers a whole country. Now, when we see that the heart of David had
   sometimes been wholly filled with anguish, we need no longer wonder if
   at times the violence of temptation overwhelm us; but let us ask with
   David, that even whilst we are as it were at the point of despair, God
   would succor us.

   18. Look upon mine affliction. By repeating these complaints so
   frequently, he plainly shows that the calamities with which he was
   assailed were not some slight and trivial evils. And this ought to be
   carefully marked by us, so that when trials and afflictions shall have
   been measured out to us after the same manner, we may be enabled to
   lift up our souls to God in prayer; for the Holy Spirit has set before
   our view this representation, that our minds may not fail us under the
   multitude or weight of afflictions. But in order to obtain an
   alleviation of these miseries, David again prays that his sins may be
   pardoned, recalling to his recollection what he had already stated,
   that he could not expect to enjoy the divine favor, unless he were
   first reconciled to God by receiving a free pardon. And, indeed, they
   are very insensible who, contented with deliverance from bodily
   affliction, do not search out the evils of their own hearts, that is to
   say, their sins, but as much as in them lies rather desire to have them
   buried in oblivion. To find a remedy, therefore, to his cares and
   sorrows, David begins by imploring the remission of his sins, because,
   so long as God is angry with us, it must necessarily follow, that all
   our affairs shall come to an unhappy termination; and he has always
   just ground of displeasure against us so long as our sins continue,
   that is to say, until he pardons them. [565] And although the Lord has
   various ends in view in bringing his people under the cross, yet we
   ought to hold fast the principle, that as often as God afflicts us, we
   are called to examine our own hearts, and humbly to seek reconciliation
   with him.

   19. Behold mine enemies. In this verse David complains of the number
   and cruelty of his enemies, because the more the people of God are
   oppressed, the more is he inclined to aid them; and in proportion to
   the magnitude of the danger by which they are surrounded, he assists
   them the more powerfully. The words, hatred of violence, [566] are here
   to be understood of a cruel and sanguinary hatred. Now, as the rage of
   David's enemies was so great, that nothing short of his death would
   satisfy them, he calls upon God to become the guardian and protector of
   his life; and from this it may be inferred, as I have already said,
   that he was now placed in extreme danger. The clause which immediately
   follows, That I may not be ashamed, may be understood in two ways. Some
   retain the future tense, I shall not be ashamed, as if David felt
   assured that he was already heard by God, and as the reward of his hope
   promised himself a gracious answer to his prayers. I am rather inclined
   to the opposite opinion -- to consider these words as still forming a
   part of his prayer. The amount of what is stated therefore is, that as
   he trusts in God, he prays that the hope of salvation which he had
   formed might not be disappointed. There is nothing better fitted to
   impart a holy ardor to our prayers, than when we are able to testify
   with sincerity of heart that we confide in God. And, therefore, it
   behoves us to ask with so much the greater care, that he would increase
   our hope when it is small, awaken it when it is dormant, confirm it
   when it is wavering, strengthen it when it is weak, and that he would
   even raise it up when it is overthrown.

   21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me. Some are of opinion,
   that in these words David simply prays that he may be preserved from
   all mischief, on the ground that he had conducted himself inoffensively
   towards others, and had abstained from all deceit and violence. Others
   make the words to contain a twofold subject of prayer, and understand
   them as including at the same time a desire that God would bestow upon
   him a sincere and upright purpose of heart; and all this lest he should
   break forth into revenge, and other unlawful means of preserving his
   life. Thus the meaning would be: Lord, although my flesh may urge me to
   seek relief from whatever quarter it may appear, and mine enemies also
   may constrain me to it by their importunity, yet do thou subdue within
   me every sinful passion, and every perverse desire, so that I may
   always exercise over my mind a pure and entire control; and let
   integrity and uprightness suffice as two powerful means of preserving
   me. We prefer the first interpretation, because he immediately subjoins
   a proof of his integrity. Whosoever waits upon God with a meek and
   quiet spirit, will rather suffer any thing which men can inflict, than
   allow himself to contend unrighteously with his enemies. In my opinion,
   therefore, David protests that such was the rectitude of his behavior
   amongst men, that the persecution of his enemies was wholly unmerited
   and unjust; and being conscious of having given no offense to any, he
   calls upon God as the protector of his innocence. But as he has
   already, in three different places, acknowledged that he was justly
   visited with affliction, it may seem strange that he should now glory
   in his integrity. This apparent inconsistency has already been
   explained in another place, where we have shown that the saints, in
   respect of themselves, always come into the presence of God with
   humility, imploring his forgiveness: and yet this does not prevent them
   from setting forth before him the goodness of their cause, and the
   justice of their claims. At the same time, in saying that he trusted in
   God, he only states what indeed is essentially necessary; for, in
   undertaking our defense, it is not enough that we have justice on our
   side, unless depending upon his promises, we rely with confidence upon
   his protection. It often happens, that men of firmness and prudence,
   even when their cause is good, do not always succeed in its defense,
   because they confide in their own understanding, or rely upon fortune.
   In order, therefore, that God may become the protector and defender of
   our innocence, let us first conduct ourselves uprightly and innocently
   towards our enemies, and then commit ourselves entirely to his
   protection.

   22. Do thou, O God! redeem Israel. By this conclusion David shows of
   what character the enemies were of whom he complained. From this it
   would appear that they were domestic enemies, who, like some disease
   raging within the bowels, were now the cause of trouble and vexation to
   the people of God. By the word redeem, which he here employs, we may
   infer that the Church was at that time oppressed with hard bondage;
   and, therefore, I have no doubt that in this psalm he alludes to Saul
   and others who reigned with him in a tyrannical manner. At the same
   time, he shows that he has respect not merely to his own benefit, but
   that he comprehends in his prayer the state of the whole realm, just as
   the mutual communion and connection which subsist among the saints
   require that every individual, deeply affected by a sense of the public
   calamities which befall the Church at large, should unite with all the
   others in lamentation before God. This contributed in no small degree
   to confirm the faith of David, when, regarding himself as in all things
   connected with the whole body of the faithful, he considered that all
   the afflictions and wrongs which he endured were common to himself with
   them. And we ought to regard it as of the greatest importance, that in
   accordance with this rule, every one of us, in bewailing his private
   miseries and trials, should extend his desires and prayers to the whole
   Church.

   PSALM 26.

   This psalm, for the most part, is similar to the preceding. The
   prophet, oppressed with numerous wrongs, and finding no succor in the
   world, implores the aid of God, entreating him to undertake the cause
   of a man unrighteously afflicted, and to assert his innocence. And as
   his contest was with hypocrites, he appeals to the judgment of God,
   sharply reproving them for making a false profession of God's name. In
   the conclusion, as if he had obtained his wish, he promises a sacrifice
   of praise to God for his deliverance.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 26:1-4

   1. Judge me, O Jehovah! because I have walked in mine integrity, and
   trusted in Jehovah, I shall not stumble. 2. Prove me, O Jehovah! and
   try me; search my reins and my heart. 3. For thy goodness is before
   mine eyes: I have therefore walked in thy truth. 4. I have not sat with
   vain men, neither will I walk with deceitful men.


   1. Judge me, O Jehovah! I have just said, that David betakes himself to
   the judgment of God, because he found neither equity nor humanity among
   men. The Hebrew word which is rendered to judge, signifies to undertake
   the cognisance of a cause. The meaning here, therefore, is as if David
   called upon God to be the defender of his right. [567] When God leaves
   us for a time to the injuries and petulance of our enemies, he seems to
   neglect our cause; but when he restrains them from assailing us at
   their pleasure he clearly demonstrates that the defense of our cause is
   the object of his care. Let us, therefore, learn from the example of
   David, when we are destitute of man's aid, to have recourse to the
   judgment-seat of God, and to rely upon his protection. The clause which
   follows is variously explained by interpreters. Some read it in
   connection with the first clause, Judge me, O Jehovah! because I have
   walked in mine integrity; but others refer it to the last clause,
   Because I have walked in mine integrity, therefore I shall not stumble.
   In my opinion, it may be properly connected with both. As it is the
   proper work of God to maintain and defend righteous causes, the
   Psalmist, in constituting him his defender, summons him as the witness
   of his integrity and trust, and thus conceives the hope of obtaining
   his aid. If, on the other hand, any one thinks that the clauses should
   be separated, it seems most probable that this sentence, judge me, O
   Lord! should be read by itself; and then that the second prayer should
   follow, that God would not allow him to stumble, because he had behaved
   himself inoffensively and uprightly, etc. But there is a force in the
   possessive pronoun my, which interpreters have overlooked. For David
   does not simply aver that he had been upright, but that he had
   constantly proceeded in an upright course, without being driven from
   his purpose, however powerful the devices by which he had been
   assailed. When wicked men attack us with a view to overwhelm us, either
   by force or fraud, we know how difficult it is to preserve always the
   same fortitude. We place our hope of victory in endeavoring resolutely
   and vigorously to oppose force to force, and art to art. And this is a
   temptation which so much the more affects honest and steady men, who
   are otherwise zealous to do well, when the cruelty of their enemies
   compels them to turn aside from the right path. Let us, therefore,
   learn from the example of David, even when an opportunity of injuring
   our enemies is offered us, and when by various methods they force and
   provoke us, to remain firm in our course, and not suffer ourselves to
   be diverted in any manner from persevering in the path of our
   integrity.

   2. Prove me, [568] O Jehovah! The more that David observed himself
   basely and undeservedly pursued with calumnies, the more powerfully was
   he excited by the vehemence of his grief fearlessly to assert his
   rectitude. Nor does he merely clear himself of outward sins; he glories
   also in the uprightness of his heart, and the purity of its affections,
   tacitly comparing himself, at the same time, with his enemies. As they
   were gross hypocrites, proudly boasting of their reverence for God, he
   lays open before him their shameless effrontery and hardihood. This
   protestation, too, shows how intimately acquainted he was with himself,
   when he durst offer to submit the whole recesses of his heart to the
   examination of God. It is to be observed, however, that it was the
   wickedness of his enemies which forced him to commend himself so much.
   Had he not been unjustly condemned by men, he would have humbly
   deprecated such an examination, as he well knew, notwithstanding his
   zeal to act aright, that he was far from perfection. But when he felt
   himself to be falsely accused, the injustice and cruelty of men
   emboldened him to appeal to God's judgment-seat without hesitation. And
   as he knew that an external appearance of innocence was of no avail
   there, he brings forward the honest uprightness of his heart. The
   distinction which some make here, that the heart signifies the higher
   affections, and the reins those that are sensual (as they term them)
   and more gross, is more subtle than solid. We know that the Hebrews
   understood by the term reins that which is most secret in men. David,
   therefore, conscious of his innocence, offers the whole man to the
   examination of God; not like careless, or rather stupid men, who,
   flattering themselves, imagine that they will deceive God with their
   pretences. It is evident, on the contrary, that he had honestly and
   thoroughly searched himself, before he presented himself with such
   confidence in the divine presence. And this we must especially bear in
   mind, if we would desire to obtain the approbation of God, that when
   unjustly persecuted, we must not only abstain from retaliation, but
   also persevere in a right spirit.

   3. For thy goodness is before mine eyes. This verse may be viewed as
   one sentence, or divided into two parts, but with almost the same
   sense. If the former reading is adopted, both the verbs will be
   emphatic, after this manner: "Because thy goodness, O Lord, has been
   ever before mine eyes, and I have trusted in thy faithfulness, I have
   restrained all wicked lusts in my heart, lest, provoked by the malice
   of mine enemies, I should be forced to retaliate." By this
   interpretation there would be the rendering of a cause. The other
   exposition, also, is not unsuitable, namely, "Because thy goodness has
   been before mine eyes, I have walked in the truth which thou
   commandest." In this case the conjunction, as is common among the
   Hebrews, is superfluous. But although this exposition is allied to the
   former, I would rather prefer one less remote from the words. As it is
   a rare and difficult virtue, not only to refrain one's self from wicked
   actions, when greatly tempted thereto, but also to preserve integrity
   of heart; the prophet declares in what manner he pursued his course in
   the midst of such powerful temptations, telling us that it was by
   setting the goodness of God, which so carefully preserves his servants,
   before his eyes, lest, declining to evil practices, he might deprive
   himself of his protection; and by confiding in his faithfulness, he
   possessed his soul in patience, firmly persuaded that God would never
   forsake his faithful people who trusted in him. And certainly, had he
   not relied upon the goodness of God, he could not have so constantly
   prosecuted the path of integrity amidst such numerous and such severe
   assaults. It is, indeed, a remarkable difference between the children
   of God and worldly men, that the former, in the hope of a favorable
   issue at the Lord's hand, rely upon his word, and are not driven by
   restlessness to mischievous practices; while the latter, although they
   maintain a good cause, yet because they are ignorant of the providence
   of God, are hurried hither and thither; follow unlawful counsels;
   betake themselves to craftiness; and, in short, have no other object
   than to overcome evil with evil. Whence, accordingly, their miserable
   and sorrowful, and often their tragical ends, but because, despising
   the favor of God, they give themselves up to cunning and deceit? In
   short, David was steady in preserving his uprightness, because he had
   resolved that God should be his guide. In the first place, therefore,
   he mentions his goodness, and afterwards he adds, his truth, because
   his goodness, which enables us to walk with unyielding courage in the
   midst of all temptations, is only known to us by his promises.

   4. I have not sat with vain men. He again declares the very great
   dissimilarity which existed between him and his adversaries. For the
   contrast is always to be observed, that wicked men, by all the harm and
   mischief they wrought against him, could never drive him from the path
   of rectitude. This verse might likewise be joined with the former, as
   if completing the sentence, in this way, That David, by confiding in
   the favor of God, had withdrawn himself from deceivers. The words,
   sitting and walking, denote sharing in counsel and fellowship in
   working, according to what is said in the first psalm. David denies
   that he had any intercourse with vain and deceitful men. And certainly
   the best remedy to recall and save us from the assembly of the wicked
   is to fix our eyes upon God's goodness; for he who walks in the
   confidence of God's protection, committing all events to his
   providence, will never imitate their deceitfulness. Those whom he
   denominates in the first clause, men of vanity, he soon after terms
   nlmym, naälamim, that is, close and wrapped up in craftiness. [569] For
   in this consists the vanity of dissimulation, that deceitful men
   conceal in their hearts another thing than that which their tongues
   declare. It is, however, absurd to derive this word from lm, alam, to
   play, for it is out of place here to compare their impostures to
   children's play. I confess, indeed, that those who give themselves to
   craftiness are mockers; but why have recourse to such a forced
   exposition, when it is plain that the word shows the source from which
   all lying and deceit proceed? Thus faith, which steadily looks to God's
   promises, is aptly opposed to all the crooked and iniquitous counsels
   in which unbelief involves us as often as we ascribe not proper honor
   to the guardianship of God. David teaches, by his own example, that we
   have not the slightest cause to fear that our integrity will make us a
   prey to the ungodly, when God promises us safety under his hand. The
   children of God, indeed, are prudent, but their prudence is altogether
   different from that of the flesh. Under the guidance and government of
   the Holy Spirit, they take every necessary precaution against snares,
   but in such a manner as not to practice any craftiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [567] Hammond renders the original word, "Plead for, or defend me;" and
   Green, "Vindicate me." The word denotes both the act of a judge and of
   an advocate. This last view agrees very well with the scope of the
   psalm, which, from the strong assertions of innocence with which it
   abounds, appears to have been written by David in vindication of
   himself from various crimes which had been alleged against him;
   although the particular events to which it refers are not indicated.

   [568] The primary signification of the Hebrew word tsrph, tsaraph is to
   try as the refiner tries his gold by dissolving and melting it, In this
   sense it is used in Psalm 66:10, "Thou hast tried us as silver is
   tried."

   [569] Horsley renders the word, "Those who seek concealment." In like
   manner, the Chaldee paraphrases it, "They that hide themselves that
   they may do evil."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 26:5-7

   5. I hate the assembly of transgressors, and I will not sit with the
   wicked. 6. I will wash my hands in purity, [570] and will encompass
   thine altar, O Jehovah! 7. That I may make men to hear the voice of thy
   praise, and tell them of all thy wonderful works.


   5. I hate the assembly. The Psalmist protests again how greatly he
   abhorred the ungodly. Formerly he denied that he had any fellowship
   with them; now he still more explicitly declares that he fled from
   their company with loathing, for that is the meaning of the phrase, I
   hate. It is indeed true, that the wicked are everywhere hated; but how
   few withdraw themselves from them, that they may not imitate their
   vices! David asserts both; he tells us that he hated their society, and
   that he had no communion with them, from which it appears that he
   warred not so much with their persons as with their evil doings. He
   mentions also as another qualification, that he shunned the wicked in
   such a manner as not on that account to forsake the congregation of
   God, or withdraw himself from the company of those with whom he was
   commanded by divine appointment to associate. Many err in this way
   grievously; imagining when they see the evil mingled with the good,
   that they will be infected with pollution, unless they immediately
   withdraw themselves from the whole congregation. This preciseness drove
   the Donatists of old, and prior to them the Cathari and the Novatians,
   into mischievous schisms. In our own times, too, the Anabaptists, from
   a similar conceit, have separated themselves from the sacred
   assemblies, because they reckoned them not so free from all defilement
   as could have been wished. Moreover, the Donatists made themselves a
   laughing-stock in a certain process, by tenaciously clinging to mere
   words. When an assembly was held to settle dissensions, and they were
   invited by the president of the meeting, with a view to do honor to
   them, to take a seat, they replied, they would stand, because it was
   not lawful to "sit with the wicked." Why then, wittily replied
   Augustine, did your conscience permit you to come in amongst us? for
   the one is written as well as the other, I will not go in to the
   wicked, neither will I sit with the ungodly. David, therefore,
   prudently moderates his zeal, and while separating himself from the
   ungodly, ceases not to frequent the temple, as the divine commandment
   and the order prescribed in the law required. When he denominates them
   the assembly of the ungodly, we may unquestionably conclude, that their
   number was not few; nay, it is probable that they flaunted about at
   that time, as if they alone were exalted above the people of God, and
   were lords over them: yet this did not prevent David from coming as
   usual to the sacrifices. Public care, indeed, is to be used that the
   Church be not defiled by such wickedness, and every man ought privately
   to endeavor, in his own place, that his remissness and forbearance do
   not cherish the disorders which these vices occasion. Although,
   however, this strictness should not be exercised with that care which
   is necessary, there is nothing in this to hinder any of the faithful
   from piously and holily remaining in the fellowship of the Church. It
   is to be observed, in the meantime, that what retained David, was his
   communion with God and with sacred things.

   6. I will wash my hands in purity. Referring, in these words, to the
   ordinary use of the sacrifices, he makes a distinction between himself
   and those who professed to offer the same divine worship, and thrust
   themselves forward in the services of the sanctuary, as if they alone
   had the sole right to perform them. As David, therefore, and these
   hypocrites were one in this respect, that they entered the sanctuary,
   and surrounded the sacred altar together, he proceeds to show that he
   was a true worshipper, declaring, that he not only diligently attended
   to the external rites, but came to worship God with unfeigned devotion.
   It is obvious that he alludes to the solemn rite of washing which was
   practiced under the law. [571] He, accordingly, reproves the gross
   superstition of hypocrites, who in seeking only the purification of
   water, neglected true purification; whereas it was God's design, in the
   appointment of the outward sign, to put men in mind of their inward
   pollution, and thus to encourage them to repentance. The outward
   washing alone, instead of profiting hypocrites, kept them at a greater
   distance from God. When the Psalmist, therefore, says, I will wash my
   hands in innocence, he intimates that they only gather more pollution
   and filth by their washings. The Hebrew word nqyvn, nikkayon, signifies
   the cleanness of any thing, and is figuratively used for innocence. We
   thus see, that as hypocrites derive no moral purity whatever from their
   washings, David mocks at the labor with which they vainly toil and
   torment themselves in such rites. However high, therefore, the wicked
   may be exalted in the Church, and though crowds of them should fill our
   sanctuaries, let us, after the example of David, celebrate the outward
   profession of our faith in such a manner as not deceitfully to
   substitute its external rites in the room of true devotion. Thus shall
   we be pure and free from all stain of wickedness. Moreover, as the
   people were not permitted to touch the altar, David uses the word
   encompass. [572]

   7. That I may make men to hear, etc In these words, he shows that he
   referred the sacrifices to their proper use and design, which
   hypocrites were far from doing. They neither know, nor do they
   consider, for what purpose God appointed the services of worship, but
   think it sufficient to thrust themselves into the divine presence with
   the pomp and form of their dissimulation. David, therefore, wishing to
   distinguish spiritual worship from that which is fictitious and
   counterfeit, affirms that he came into the sanctuary to set forth the
   praise of God's name. There is, however, a synecdoche in his words, as
   only one kind of worship is mentioned, although, in offering the
   sacrifices, the exercise of repentance and faith was required, as well
   as the giving of thanks. But as the ultimate design of the sacrifices,
   or at least their principal object was to celebrate the goodness of God
   in thus acknowledging his blessings, there was no impropriety in
   comprehending the other parts of worship under this. Thus, in Psalm
   50:14, the sacrifice of praise is preferred to all external ceremonies,
   as if the whole of devotion consisted in it alone. Likewise in Psalm
   116:12, it is said, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his
   benefits? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
   the Lord." Moreover, that he may the better commend the acknowledged
   power of God, and more impressively extol his benefits, David employs
   the phrase wondrous; as if he had said, that it was in no ordinary way
   that God had helped him.

   [570] "Innocence." -- Fr. marg

   [571] The washing of the hands in solemn protestation of innocence, on
   particular occasions, was enjoined by the Mosaic ritual, and was common
   among the Jews, Deuteronomy 21:6, 7. It was in common use among them
   before prayer; and the priests, in particular, were not to perform any
   sacred office in the sanctuary until they had poured water from the
   laver, which was set in the temple for that purpose, and washed their
   hands, Exodus 40:30-33.

   [572] Mudge conjectures that the expression, encompass, is probably
   taken from the custom of forming a ring round the altar at the time of
   worship. And Goodwyn informs us, that at the feast of tabernacles the
   people, on the seventh day, encompassed the altar seven times, carrying
   branches of palm trees in their hands in remembrance of the overthrow
   of Jericho, and singing hosannas. -- Moses and Aaron, p. 132. David,
   however, may refer to the practice of the priests, who, when they
   offered sacrifices, went round about the altar; and his meaning may
   simply be, that as the priests first washed their hands, and then
   performed their sacred office at the altar; so he deeply felt the
   necessity of personal purity, in order to his engaging in the service
   of God.

   Psalm 26:8-11

   8. O Jehovah! I have loved the habitation of thy house, [573] and the
   dwelling-place of thy glory. 9. Gather not my soul with wicked men, nor
   my life with blood; [574] 10. For in their hands is maliciousness, and
   their right hand is full of bribes. 11. But I will walk in mine
   integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me.


   8. O Jehovah! I have loved, etc In this verse he confirms what he had
   said before, that he came not into the sanctuary in a careless manner,
   but with serious devotion. Irreligious men, although they often resort
   to the sacred assemblies, frequent them merely as lurking places, where
   they may escape the eye of God. On the contrary, the truly pious and
   pure in heart resort to them, not for the sake of vain ostentation, but
   as they are sincerely bent on seeking God, they willingly and
   affectionately employ the helps which he there affords them; and the
   advantage which they derive from them creates love to them in their
   hearts, and longings after them. This declaration farther shows, that
   however David excelled others in faith, yet he was not without fear
   lest the violence of his enemies might deprive him of the ordinary
   means of instruction which God had conferred on his Church. He felt his
   need of the Church's common discipline and order, and he therefore
   anxiously labored to retain his enjoyment of them. From this we infer
   the impious pride of those who look with contempt on the services of
   religion as unnecessary, although David himself could not live without
   them. Another consideration, indeed, existed in those days, I confess,
   while the law, like a schoolmaster, held the ancient people in a state
   of servitude compared with ours. Our case, however, is one with theirs
   in this respect, that the weakness of our faith requires help as well
   as theirs. And as God for this purpose has appointed the sacraments, as
   well as the whole order of the Church, woe to the pride of those who
   recklessly desert the services which we perceive to have been held in
   such high esteem by the pious servants of God. The Hebrew word mvn,
   me-on, according to some, is derived from a word [575] which signifies
   an eye; and they translate it comeliness, or appearance. This is the
   translation of the Septuagint. [576] But as the word is almost every
   where used to signify a dwelling-place, which is more simple, I prefer
   to retain it. The sanctuary is called God's house, and the
   dwelling-place of his glory; and we know how frequently expressions of
   this kind are employed in Scripture to bear testimony to the presence
   of God. Not that God either dwelt in a tent, or wished to confine the
   minds of his people to earthly symbols; but it was needful to remind
   the faithful of God's present goodness, that they might not think they
   sought him in vain, as we have elsewhere already said. Now, that God's
   glory may dwell among us, it is necessary that a lively image of it
   should shine forth in word and sacraments. From this it follows, that
   the temples which are reckoned such among Papists are only filthy
   brothels of Satan.

   9. Gather not my soul with wicked men. Having now affirmed his
   innocence, he has recourse again to prayer, and calls upon God to
   defend him. At first sight, indeed, it appears strange to pray that God
   would not involve a righteous man in the same destruction with the
   wicked; but God, with paternal indulgence, allows this freedom in
   prayer, that his people may themselves in this way correct their
   anxieties, and overcome the fears with which they are tempted. David,
   when he conceived this supplication, in order to free himself from
   anxiety and fear, placed before his eyes the righteous judgment of God,
   to whom nothing is more abhorrent than to mingle good and bad together
   without distinction. The Hebrew word 'sph, asaph, sometimes signifies
   to gather together, and sometimes to destroy. In this place, I am of
   opinion it signifies to gather into a heap, as was wont to be the case
   in a confused slaughter. This was the objection stated by Abraham,

   "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
   with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that
   be far from thee." (Genesis 18:25,)

   Let us remember, therefore, that these forms of prayer are dictated by
   the Holy Spirit, in order that the faithful may unhesitatingly assure
   themselves that God still sits in inquisition upon every man's case, in
   order to give righteous judgment at last. In the second clause, instead
   of the phrase, wicked men, he uses bloody men, amplifying what he had
   said. For although many wicked men rush not all at once to murder, yet
   in process of time they harden themselves to cruelty; nor does Satan
   allow them to rest until he precipitate them into deeds of blood.

   10. For in their hands is maliciousness. The Hebrew word zmh, zimmah,
   signifies properly an inward stratagem, or device. But here it is not
   improperly applied to the hands, because David wished to intimate, that
   the wicked, of whom he was speaking, not only secretly imagined
   deceits, but also vigorously executed with their hands the malice which
   their hearts devised. When he farther says, Their right hands are full
   of bribes, we may infer from this, that it was not the common people
   whom he pointed out for observation, but the nobility themselves, who
   were most guilty of practising this corruption. Although the common and
   baser sort of men may be hired for reward, and suborned as agents in
   wickedness, yet we know that bribes are offered chiefly to judges, and
   other great men who are in power; and we likewise know, that at the
   time referred to here the worst of men bore sway. It was no wonder,
   therefore, that David complained that justice was exposed to sale. We
   are farther admonished by this expression, that those who delight in
   gifts can scarcely do otherwise than sell themselves to iniquity. Nor
   is it in vain, unquestionably, that God declares that

   "gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the hearts of the
   righteous,"
   (Deuteronomy 16:19.)

   11. But I will walk in mine integrity. In this repetition there is to
   be remarked a circumstance which more clearly illustrates David's
   righteousness; namely, that, in the midst of so many temptations, he
   steadily held on his way. He saw many become suddenly rich by gifts, as
   we still see those who sit at the helm of affairs accumulating to
   themselves, in a very brief space, a great abundance of wealth,
   building sumptuous palaces, and extending their lands far and wide. As
   no allurements could induce him to imitate their example in this, he
   gave a proof of rare and heroic virtue. He therefore affirms with
   truth, that although the world accounted them happy, he had not been
   seduced from his wonted integrity, that thus it might appear that he
   ascribed more to the providence of God than to evil practices. He,
   therefore, beseeches God to redeem him, because, being oppressed with
   wrongs, and tempted in various ways, he relied only on God, trusting
   that he would deliver him. From this we may conclude, that he was at
   this time reduced to great straits. He adds, Be merciful to me, by
   which he shows that this deliverance flows from the grace of God, as
   its true source; and we have already seen that the cause is often put
   for the effect.

   Psalm 26:12

   12. My foot hath stood in uprightness: [577] in the congregations will
   I bless thee, O Jehovah!


   This verse may be explained in two ways. Some are of opinion that David
   declares how carefully he had studied uprightness among men; but I
   rather think that he celebrates the grace of God towards him, and, at
   the same time, vows his gratitude. By the use of the metaphor,
   therefore, he tells us that he was preserved in safety. And as he knew
   that it was the hand of God alone which enabled him to stand, he
   therefore addresses himself to the exercise of praise and thanksgiving.
   Nor does he merely say, that he will acknowledge in private the
   goodness of God bestowed upon him, but in public also, that the
   assemblies of God's people may be witnesses of it. It is highly
   necessary that every one should publicly celebrate his experience of
   the grace of God, as an example to others to confide in him. [578]

   PSALM 27.

   In this psalm, David rehearses the desires and meditations with which
   he had exercised himself in the midst of his great dangers. The
   thanksgivings which he mingles with them show that it was composed
   after his deliverance. It is also probable that he repeats at once the
   prayers which had exercised his thoughts in his different meditations.
   Hence it is to be seen here with what invincible fortitude of soul the
   holy man was endued, that he might overcome the most grievous assaults
   of his enemies. His wonderful piety shines forth in this: that he
   wished to live for no other purpose than to serve God, nor could he be
   turned aside from this purpose by any anxiety or trouble.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 27:1-3

   1. Jehovah is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Jehovah is
   the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? 2. When the wicked
   came upon me to eat up my flesh, when my oppressors and mine enemies
   came upon me, they stumbled and fell. 3. Though armies should encamp
   against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me,
   in this will I be confident.


   1. Jehovah is my light. This commencement may be understood as meaning
   that David, having already experienced God's mercy, publishes a
   testimony of his gratitude. But I rather incline to another meaning,
   namely, that, perceiving the conflict he had to wage with the sharpest
   temptations, he fortifies himself beforehand, and as it were brings
   together matter for confidence: for it is necessary that the saints
   earnestly wrestle with themselves to repel or subdue the doubts which
   the flesh is so prone to cherish, that they may cheerfully and speedily
   betake themselves to prayer. David, accordingly, having been tossed
   with various tempests, at length recovers himself, and shouts
   triumphantly over the troubles with which he had been harassed,
   rejoicing that whenever God displays his mercy and favor, there is
   nothing to be feared. This is farther intimated by the accumulation of
   terms which he employs, when he calls God not only his light, but his
   salvation, and the rock or strength of his life His object was, to put
   a threefold shield, as it were, against his various fears, as
   sufficient to ward them off. The term light, as is well known, is used
   in Scripture to denote joy, or the perfection of happiness. Farther, to
   explain his meaning, he adds that God was his salvation and the
   strength of his life, as it was by his help that he felt himself safe,
   and free from the terrors of death. Certainly we find that all our
   fears arise from this source, that we are too anxious about our life,
   while we acknowledge not that God is its preserver. We can have no
   tranquillity, therefore, until we attain the persuasion that our life
   is sufficiently guarded, because it is protected by his omnipotent
   power. The interrogation, too, shows how highly David esteemed the
   Divine protection, as he thus boldly exults against all his enemies and
   dangers. Nor assuredly do we ascribe due homage to God, unless,
   trusting to his promised aid, we dare to boast of the certainty of our
   safety. Weighing, as it were, in scales the whole power of earth and
   hell, David accounts it all lighter than a feather, and considers God
   alone as far outweighing the whole.

   Let us learn, therefore, to put such a value on God's power to protect
   us as to put to flight all our fears. Not that the minds of the
   faithful can, by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, be at all times
   entirely devoid of fear; but immediately recovering courage, let us,
   from the high tower of our confidence, look down upon all our dangers
   with contempt. Those who have never tasted the grace of God tremble
   because they refuse to rely on him, and imagine that he is often
   incensed against them, or at least far removed from them. But with the
   promises of God before our eyes, and the grace which they offer, our
   unbelief does him grievous wrong, if we do not with unshrinking courage
   boldly set him against all our enemies. When God, therefore, kindly
   allures us to himself, and assures us that he will take care of our
   safety, since we have embraced his promises, or because we believe him
   to be faithful, it is meet that we highly extol his power, that it may
   ravish our hearts with admiration of himself. We must mark well this
   comparison, What are all creatures to God? Moreover, we must extend
   this confidence still farther, in order to banish all fears from our
   consciences, like Paul, who, when speaking of his eternal salvation,
   boldly exclaims,

   "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:34.)

   2. When the wicked, etc. There is no reason for translating this
   sentence, as some interpreters do, into the future tense. [579] But
   while we retain the past tense which the prophet employs, the words may
   be explained in a twofold manner. The meaning but in the prophetic
   writings it is often used for the future. There does not, however, as
   Calvin remarks, appear to be any necessity for translating the verbs
   into the future tense in this passage, in which David may be considered
   as contemplating the past evidences of the goodness of God towards him,
   and from them taking encouragement with respect to the future. either
   is, that David celebrates the victory which he had obtained by the
   blessing of God; or there is a reference to the manner in which he had
   encouraged himself to hope the best, even in the midst of his
   temptations, namely, by thinking of God's former favors. The latter is
   the exposition which I prefer. They both, however, amount to the same
   thing, and imply that David had no reason henceforth to doubt of God's
   assistance when he considered his former experience; for nothing is of
   greater use to confirm our faith, than the remembrance of those
   instances in which God has clearly given us a proof not only of his
   grace, but of his truth and power. I connect this verse, accordingly,
   with the following one. In the former, David recalls to mind the
   triumphs which, by God's help, he had already obtained; and from this
   he concludes, that by what hosts soever he may be environed, or
   whatever mischief his enemies may devise against him, he would
   fearlessly stand up against them. The Hebrew word qrv karab, signifies
   to approach; but here it refers to the irruption that David's enemies
   made upon him when they assaulted him. Some translate it to fight, but
   this translation is flat. To testify his innocence, he calls them
   wicked or froward, and by saying that they came upon him to eat up his
   flesh, [580] he expresses their savage cruelty.

   3. Though armies should encamp. He infers from his former experience,
   as I have already mentioned, that whatever adversity may befall him, he
   ought to hope well, and to have no misgivings about the divine
   protection, which had been so effectually vouchsafed to him in his
   former need. He had asserted this, indeed, in the first verse, but now,
   upon farther proof of it, he repeats it. Under the terms, camps and
   armies, he includes whatever is most formidable in the world: as if he
   had said, Although all men should conspire for my destruction, I will
   disregard their violence, because the power of God, which I know is on
   my side, is far above theirs. But when he declares, My heart shall not
   fear, this does not imply that he would be entirely devoid of fear, --
   for that would have been more worthy of the name of insensibility than
   of virtue; but lest his heart should faint under the terrors which he
   had to encounter, he opposed to them the shield of faith. Some transfer
   the word translated in this to the following verse, meaning that he was
   confident that he would dwell in God's house; but I am of opinion that
   it belongs rather to the preceding doctrine. For then does faith bring
   forth its fruit in due season, when we remain firm and fearless in the
   midst of dangers. David, therefore, intimates, that when the trial
   comes, his faith will prove invincible, because it relies on the power
   of God.

   Psalm 27:4-6

   4. One thing have I desired of Jehovah, this will I follow after; that
   I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold
   the beauty of Jehovah, and diligently to survey his temple. 5. For he
   shall hide me in his tent in the day of evil: [581] he shall hide me in
   the secret place of his tent; he shall set me up upon a rock. 6. And
   now shall he lift up my head above mine enemies who surround me: and I
   will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle; I will sing and praise
   Jehovah.


   4. One thing have I desired. Some consider this as a prophecy of the
   perpetuity of David's kingdom, on which not only his own personal
   happiness depended, but also the happiness of his whole people; as if
   he had said, I am so well contented with this singular proof of God's
   favor, that I can think on nothing else night and day. In my opinion,
   however, it appears a simpler interpretation to view the words as
   meaning, that although David was banished from his country, despoiled
   of his wife, bereft of his kinsfolk; and, in fine, dispossessed of his
   substance, yet he was not so desirous for the recovery of these, as he
   was grieved and afflicted for his banishment from God's sanctuary, and
   the loss of his sacred privileges. Under the word one, there is an
   implied antithesis, in which David, disregarding all other interests,
   displays his intense affection for the service of God; so that it was
   bitterer to him to be an exile from the sanctuary, than to be denied
   access to his own house. That David desired only one thing, therefore,
   namely, to dwell in the house of the Lord, must be read in one
   sentence. For there is no probability that he means by this some secret
   wish which he suppressed, seeing he distinctly proclaims what it was
   that chiefly troubled him. He adds, too, steadiness of purpose,
   declaring that he will not cease to reiterate these prayers. Many may
   be seen spurring on with great impetuosity at first, whose ardor, in
   process of time, not only languishes, but is almost immediately
   extinguished. By declaring, therefore, that he would persevere in this
   wish during his whole life, he thereby distinguishes between himself
   and hypocrites.

   We must, however, observe by what motive David was so powerfully
   stimulated. "Surely," some may say, "he could have called on God beyond
   the precincts of the temple. Wherever he wandered as an exile, he
   carried with him the precious promise of God, so that he needed not to
   put so great a value upon the sight of the external edifice. He
   appears, by some gross imagination or other, to suppose that God could
   be enclosed by wood and stones." But if we examine the words more
   carefully, it will be easy to see, that his object was altogether
   different from a mere sight of the noble building and its ornaments,
   however costly. He speaks, indeed, of the beauty of the temple, but he
   places that beauty not so much in the goodliness that was to be seen by
   the eye, as in its being the celestial pattern which was shown to
   Moses, as it is written in Exodus 25:40,

   "And look that thou make them after this pattern which was showed thee
   in the mount."

   As the fashion of the temple was not framed according to the wisdom of
   man, but was an image of spiritual things, the prophet directed his
   eyes and all his affections to this object. Their madness is,
   therefore, truly detestable who wrest this place in favor of pictures
   and images, which, instead of deserving to be numbered among temple
   ornaments, are rather like dung and filth, defiling all the purity of
   holy things. We should now consider, whether the faithful are to be
   like-minded under the Christian or Gospel dispensation. [582] I own,
   indeed, that we are in very different circumstances from the ancient
   fathers; but so far as God still preserves his people under a certain
   external order, and draws them to him by earthly instructions, temples
   have still their beauty, which deservedly ought to draw the affections
   and desires of the faithful to them. The Word, sacraments, public
   prayers, and other helps of the same kind, cannot be neglected, without
   a wicked contempt of God, who manifests himself to us in these
   ordinances, as in a mirror or image.

   5. For he shall hide me in his tent. Here the Psalmist promises himself
   that his prayer would not be in vain. Although he is deprived of the
   visible sanctuary for a time, he doubts not that, wherever he may be,
   he shall experience the protecting power of God. And he alludes to the
   temple, because it was a symbol to the faithful of the divine presence;
   as if he had said, that in making the request which he mentioned he by
   no means lost his labor; for every one who shall seek God sincerely,
   and with a pure heart, shall be safely concealed under the wings of his
   protection. The figure of the temple, he therefore affirms, was not an
   unmeaning one, for there God, so to speak, spread forth his wings to
   gather true believers under his protection. From this he concludes,
   that as he had no greater desire than to flee for refuge under these
   wings, there would be a shelter ready for him in times of adversity,
   under the divine protection, which, under the figure of a rock, he
   tells us, would be impregnable like towers, which, for the sake of
   strength, were wont to be built, in ancient times, in lofty places.
   Although he was, therefore, at this time, environed by enemies on every
   side, yet he boasts that he shall overcome them. It is, indeed, a
   common form of speech in the Scriptures to say, that those who are
   oppressed with grief walk with a bowed down back and dejected
   countenance, while, on the other hand, they lift up their heads when
   their joyfulness is restored. Thus David spake, Psalm 3:4, "Thou, Lord,
   art the lifter up of mine head." But because besieging is here put in
   opposition to this, he meant to say, that in that divine refuge he
   would be as it were lifted on high, so that he might fearlessly
   disregard the darts of his enemies, which might have otherwise pierced
   him. And in hoping for victory, though he was reduced to such straits
   as threatened instant death, he gives us a remarkable proof of his
   faith; by which we are taught not to measure the aid of God by outward
   appearances or visible means, but even in the midst of death to hope
   for deliverance from his powerful and victorious hand.

   6. And I will offer sacrifices of triumph [583] in his tabernacle. By
   making a solemn vow of thanksgiving, after he shall have been delivered
   from dangers, he confirms himself again in the hope of deliverance. The
   faithful under the Law, we know, were wont, by a solemn rite, to pay
   their vows, when they had experienced any remarkable blessing from God.
   Here, therefore, David, though in banishment, and prohibited from
   approaching the temple, boasts that he would again come to the altar of
   God, and offer the sacrifice of praise. It appears, however, that he
   tacitly sets the holy rejoicing and songs, in which he promises to give
   thanks to God, in opposition to the profane triumphings of the world.

   Psalm 27:7-9

   7. Hear, O Jehovah! my voice, with which I cry unto thee; have mercy
   upon me, and answer me. 8. My heart said to thee, [584] Seek ye my
   face; therefore, [585] thy face, O Jehovah! will I seek. 9. Hide not
   thy face from me; east not away thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast
   been my strength; leave me not, neither forsake me utterly, O God of my
   salvation!


   7. Hear, O Jehovah! my voice. The Psalmist returns again to prayer, and
   in doing so, he declares with what armor he was furnished to break
   through his temptations. By the word cry, he expresses his vehemence,
   as I have elsewhere said, that he may thereby move God the sooner to
   help him. For the same purpose, also, he a little after mentions his
   misery, because the more the faithful are oppressed, the more does
   their very need induce God to extend his favor towards them.

   8. My heart said to thee. The change of person in the verbs has
   occasioned a variety of interpretations of this verse. But whoever
   closely examines David's design will perceive that the text runs
   perfectly well. As it becomes us not rashly to rush into the presence
   of God, until he first calls us, David first tells us, that he
   carefully considered how gently and sweetly God prevents his people, by
   spontaneously inviting them to seek his face; and then, recovering his
   cheerfulness, he declares he would come wheresoever God may call him.
   The sense of the Hebrew word lk, leka, is somewhat ambiguous. It may
   mean the same thing as tibi, to thee, in Latin. But as the Hebrew
   letter l, lamed, is often used for the preposition of, or concerning,
   it may properly enough be translated, my heart hath said of thee; an
   exposition to which the majority of interpreters incline. More
   probably, however, in my opinion, it denotes a mutual conversation
   between God and the prophet. I have just said, that no one can
   believingly rise to seek God until the way is first opened by God's
   invitation, as I have elsewhere shown from the prophet's declaration,

   "I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God,"
   (Zechariah 13:9.)

   David accordingly says, that in this way the door was opened for him to
   seek God: he brings forward this promise, and thus responds, as it
   were, to God. [586] And, certainly, if this symphony does not precede,
   no man will conduct aright the chorus of the invitation. As soon,
   therefore, as we hear God presenting himself to us, let us cordially
   reply, Amen; and let us think with ourselves of his promises, as if
   they were familiarly addressed to us. Thus true believers have no need
   to seek any subtle artifice or tedious circuits to introduce themselves
   into God's favor, since this preface prepares so easy a way for them,
   "However unworthy we are to be received by thee, O Lord, yet thy
   commandment, by which thou enjoinest upon us to come to thee, is
   sufficient encouragement to us." The voice of God, therefore, ought to
   resound in our hearts, like an echo in hollow places, that from this
   mutual concord there may spring confidence to call upon him.

   The term, face, is commonly explained to mean help or succor; as if it
   had been said, Seek me. But I am persuaded that the allusion here is
   also to the sanctuary, and that David refers to the mode of
   manifestation in which God was wont to render himself in some degree
   visible. No doubt, it is unlawful to form any gross or carnal idea of
   him, but as he appointed the ark of the covenant to be a token of his
   presence, it is, without any impropriety, every where denominated his
   face. It is indeed true, that we are far from God so long as we abide
   in this world, because faith is far removed from sight; but it is
   equally true, that we now see God as in a mirror, and darkly, (1
   Corinthians 13:12,) until he shall openly show himself to us at the
   last day. Under this word, therefore, I am persuaded, are represented
   to us those helps by which God raises us to his presence, descending
   from his inconceivable glory to us, and furnishing us on earth with a
   vision of his heavenly glory. But as it is according to his own
   sovereign pleasure that God vouchsafes us to look upon him, (as he does
   in Word and sacraments,) it becomes us steadily to fix our eyes on this
   view, that it may not be with us as with the Papists, who, by means of
   the wildest inventions, wickedly transform God into whatever shapes
   please their fancy, or their brains have conceived.

   9. Hide not thy face from me. The Psalmist elegantly continues the same
   form of speech, but with a different meaning. The face of God is now
   employed to describe the sensible effects of his grace and favor: as if
   it had been said, Lord, make me truly to experience that thou hast been
   near to me, and let me clearly behold thy power in saving me. We must
   observe the distinction between the theoretical knowledge derived from
   the Word of God and what is called the experimental knowledge of his
   grace. For as God shows himself present in operation, (as they usually
   speak,) he must first be sought in his Word. The sentence which
   follows, Cast not away thy servant in thine anger, some Jewish
   interpreters expound in too forced a manner to mean, Suffer not thy
   servant to be immersed in the wicked cares of this world, which are
   nothing but anger and madness. I, however, prefer to translate the
   Hebrew word nth, natah, as many translate it, to turn away from, or to
   remove. Their meaning is more probable who interpret it, Make not thy
   servant to decline to anger. When a person is utterly forsaken by God,
   he cannot but be agitated within by murmuring thoughts, and break forth
   into the manifestations of vexation and anger. If any one think that
   David now anticipates this temptation, I shall not object, for he was
   not without reason afraid of impatience, which weakens us and makes us
   go beyond the bounds of reason. But I keep to the first exposition, as
   it is confirmed by the two words which follow; and thus the term anger
   imports a tacit confession of sin; because, although David acknowledges
   that God might justly cast him off, he deprecates his anger. Moreover,
   by recalling to mind God's former favors, he encourages himself to hope
   for more, and by this argument he moves God to continue his help, and
   not to leave his work imperfect.

   [586] Calvin's meaning appears to be this:- God has given us in his
   word that gracious command or invitation, "Seek ye my face," inviting
   us to seek him by prayer and the other exercises of religion. Now, when
   David says, "My heart said to thee, Seek ye my face," he means that his
   heart reminded God of his command or invitation; and by this he
   encouraged himself to seek God's face, which he expresses his
   resolution to do in the following clause, "Thy face, O Jehovah! will I
   seek."

   Psalm 27:10-12

   10. When my father and mother shall forsake me, Jehovah will take me
   up. 11. Teach me thy way, O Jehovah! and lead me in the right path,
   because of mine adversaries. 12. Give me not up to the desire [587] of
   mine oppressors: for false witnesses have risen up against me, and he
   who bringeth forth violence.


   10. When my father and my mother shall forsake me. As it appears from
   the sacred history, that Jesse, so far as his opportunity admitted,
   performed his duty to his son David, some are of opinion that the
   nobles and councillors are here mentioned allegorically; but this is
   not suitable. Nor is it with any reason that they urge this scruple.
   David does not complain that he was unnaturally betrayed by his father
   or mother; but by this comparison he magnifies the grace of God,
   declaring, that he would ever find him ready to help him, although he
   might be forsaken of all men. The Hebrew particle ky, ki, for the most
   part, signifies for, but it is also known to be often employed for the
   adverb of time, when. David, therefore, meant to intimate, that
   whatever benevolence, love, zeal, attention, or service, might be found
   among men, they are far inferior to the paternal mercy with which God
   encircles his people. The highest degree of love among men, it is true,
   is to be found in parents who love their children as their own bowels.
   But God advances us higher, declaring, by the prophet Isaiah, that
   though a mother may forget the child of her womb, he would always be
   mindful of us, (Isaiah 49:15.) In this degree does David place him, so
   that he who is the source of all goodness far surpasses all mortals,
   who are naturally malevolent and niggardly. It is, however, an
   imperfect mode of speech, like that in Isaiah 63:16,

   "Doubtless, thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and
   Israel acknowledge us not."

   The purport of the whole is this: However inclined by nature earthly
   parents are to help their children, nay, though they should endeavor to
   cherish them with the greatest ardor of affection, yet should affection
   be wholly extinguished in the earth, God would fulfill the duty both of
   father and mother to his people. From which it follows, that we basely
   undervalue the grace of God, if our faith rise not above all the
   affections of nature; for sooner shall the laws of nature be overturned
   a hundred times, than God shall fail his people.

   11. Teach me thy way, O Jehovah! Many think that David here requests
   that God would guide him by his Spirit, lest he should surpass his
   enemies in acting violently and wickedly. This doctrine is, no doubt,
   very useful, but it does not seem to agree with the scope of the
   passage. It is a simpler interpretation, in my opinion, to consider
   that David desires, in order to escape the snares and violence of his
   enemies, that God would extend to him his hand, and safely conduct him,
   so as to give a happy issue to his affairs. He sets the right path in
   opposition to the difficulties and impediments which are in places
   which are rough, and of difficult access, to overcome which he was
   unequal, unless God undertook the office of a guide to lead him. But he
   who thus desires to commit himself to the safeguard and protection of
   God, [588] must first renounce crafty and wicked devices. We must not
   expect that God, who promises to grant a happy issue only to the single
   in heart, and those who trust in his faithfulness, will bless crooked
   and wicked counsels.

   12. Give me not up to the desire of mine oppressors. The Hebrew noun
   nphs, nephesh, signifies lust, will, or desire; and the language of
   David implies, Deliver me not up to the pleasure or lust of mine
   enemies, and thus he intimates, that they greedily gaped for his
   destruction. God delivers his people in two ways; either by appeasing
   the cruelty of the wicked, and rendering them meek; or, if he permit
   them to burn with fury, by restraining their power and violence, so
   that they desire and endeavor in vain to do mischief. The Psalmist
   afterwards adds, that he is persecuted both with slanders and false
   accusations, and also by open violence; for when he says, that they
   bring forth violence, [589] he means that they speak of nothing but of
   war and slaughter. We thus see that the holy man was miserably
   oppressed on every side. Even his integrity, which we know to have been
   singular, could not free him from bitter and deadly calumnies, and he
   was at the same time overwhelmed by the violence and force of his
   enemies. If the ungodly, therefore, should at any time rise against us,
   not only with menaces and cruel violence, but to give the semblance of
   justice to their enmity, should slander us with lies, let us remember
   the example of David, who was assaulted in both ways; nay, let us
   recall to mind that Christ the Son of God suffered no less injury from
   lying tongues than from violence. [590] Moreover, this prayer was
   dictated for our comfort, to intimate that God can maintain our
   innocence, and oppose the shield of his protection to the cruelty of
   our enemies.

   Psalm 27:13-14

   13. Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of
   the living: [591] 14. Wait thou on Jehovah; be of good courage, and he
   shall strengthen thine heart: wait thou also on Jehovah.


   13. Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah. It is
   generally agreed among interpreters, that this sentence is incomplete.
   Some, however, are of opinion, that the Hebrew particle lvl' lulë, is
   used for the purpose of affirmation, as if it were a species of oath;
   the Hebrews being accustomed to swear elliptically; for breaking off in
   the middle of the discourse and leaving it imperfect, they supplied an
   imprecation, namely, that God would punish them in case they perjured
   themselves. But the greater number give a different interpretation,
   namely, that David intimates that he was supported solely by faith,
   otherwise he had perished a hundred times. The meaning which they
   elicit, accordingly, is, Had I not relied on the promise of God, and
   been assuredly persuaded that he would safely preserve me, and had I
   not continued firm in this persuasion, I had utterly perished: There
   was no other remedy. Some understand by the land of the living, the
   heavenly inheritance; but this interpretation is forced, and disagrees
   with the usual style of Scripture. When Hezekiah laments in his song
   recorded in Isaiah 38:11, that he had no hope of seeing God "in the
   land of the living," he means, without all doubt, the present life, as
   he immediately adds, "I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
   of the world." A similar form of speech occurs also in another place,
   (Jeremiah 11:19.) David then believed that he would still enjoy the
   goodness of God in this world, although he was now deprived of all
   experience of his favor, and could see no spark of light. From the
   darkness of death, therefore, he promises himself a view of the divine
   favor, and by this persuasion his life is sustained, although,
   according to the judgment of carnal reason, it was past recovery and
   lost. It is to be observed, however, that David does not rashly go
   beyond the divine promise. It is true that "godliness is profitable
   unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that
   which is to come," (1 Timothy 4:8;) but he would have never dared to
   entertain this persuasion had he not been informed by a special
   revelation, and assuredly promised a successor, who should always sit
   upon his throne, (Psalm 132:11, 12.) He was, therefore, justly
   persuaded that he would not die till this promise was fulfilled. Lest
   any man, therefore, by an unwarranted imitation of his example, should
   overleap the boundaries of faith, it is necessary to understand what
   was peculiar to him, and did not belong to us. In general, however, we
   ought all to hope that, although God may not openly work deliverance
   for us, or show us his favor in a visible manner, he will,
   nevertheless, be always merciful to us, even in the present life.

   14. Wait thou on Jehovah. It may be doubted whether David, having in
   the preceding verses spoken of himself, here addresses his discourse to
   others, and exhorts them by his own example to fortitude and
   persevering patience, as he does in the conclusion of Psalm 31:19,
   where, after speaking concerning himself particularly, he makes a
   transition, and addresses himself to all the godly. But as he speaks
   here in the singular number, and uses no mark to show that he directs
   his discourse to others, it is in my opinion probable that he applies
   it to himself, the more to encourage his confidence in God, lest at any
   time his heart should faint. [592] As he was conscious of his weakness,
   and knew that his faith was the great means of preserving him safe, he
   seasonably strengthens himself for the future. Under the word waiting,
   too, he puts himself in mind of new trials, and sets before his eyes
   the cross which he must bear. We are then said to wait on God, when,
   withdrawing his grace from us, he suffers us to languish under
   afflictions. David, therefore, having got through one conflict,
   prepares himself to encounter new ones. But as nothing is more
   difficult than to give God the honor of relying upon him, when he hides
   himself from us, or delays his assistance, David stirs himself up to
   collect strength; as if he had said, If fearfulness steal upon thee; if
   temptation shake thy faith; if the feelings of the flesh rise in
   tumult, do not faint; but rather endeavor to rise above them by an
   invincible resolution of mind. From this we may learn, that the
   children of God overcome, not by sullenness, but by patience, when they
   commit their souls quietly to God; as Isaiah says,

   "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength,"
   (Isaiah 30:15.)

   As David did not feel himself equal to great and difficult efforts, he
   borrows strength from God by prayer. Had he said no more than Act like
   a man, [593] he would have appeared to allege the motions of his own
   free-will, but as he immediately adds, by way of correction, that God
   would be at hand to strengthen his heart, he plainly enough shows, that
   when the saints strive vigorously, they fight in the strength of
   another, and not in their own. David does not, like the Papists, put
   his own efforts into the van, and afterwards supplicate for divine aid,
   but having done his own duty, although he knew that he was destitute of
   strength in himself, he requests that his deficiency may be supplied by
   the grace of the Holy Spirit. And as he knew that the war must be
   continued during his whole life, and that new conflicts would daily
   arise, and that the troubles of the saints are often protracted for a
   long period, he again repeats what he had said about waiting on God:
   Wait thou alone on Jehovah
     __________________________________________________________________

   [591] In the Hebrew this verse is elliptical, as Calvin here translates
   it. In the French version he supplies the ellipsis, by adding to the
   end of the verse the words, "C'estoit fait de moy," "I had perished."
   In our English version, the words, "I had fainted," are introduced as a
   supplement, in the beginning of the verse. Both the supplement of
   Calvin, and that of our English version, which are substantially the
   same, doubtless explain the meaning of the passage; but they destroy
   the elegant abrupt form of the expression employed by the Psalmist, who
   breaks off in the middle of his discourse without completing the
   sentence, although what he meant to say is very evident. "Unless I had
   believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living,
   What! what, alas! should have become of me!" - Dr Adam Clarke. As,
   however, lvl', lulë, which is rendered unless, is omitted by the
   ancient versions and several MSS., some consider it an interpolation,
   and translate the verse without an ellipsis. Thus Walford renders it,
   "I have believed that I shall behold the goodness of Jehovah in the
   land of the living."

   [592] "A ce que sa foy ne soit jamais esbranier." -- Fr. "That his
   faith might never be shaken."

   [593] Calvin here seems to use the Septuagint version. What he renders
   in the text, "Be of good courage," is rendered by the Septuagint,
   andrizou "Be manly, or act like a man." The Vulgate reads, "vinliter
   ae," following the Septuagint, as it generally does. Paul uses the same
   phraseology in 1 Corinthians 16:13. "These," says Ainsworth, "are the
   words of encouragement against remissness, fear, faintness of heart, or
   other infirmities."

   PSALM 28.

   After being delivered by God's help from great dangers, David, in this
   psalm, according to his custom, first records the vows that he had made
   in the midst of his difficulties, and then his thanksgivings and
   praises to God, to induce others to follow his example. It is probable
   that he speaks of his persecutions by Saul.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 28:1-2

   1. Unto thee, O Jehovah! will I cry; O my strength! hold not thy peace
   from me; lest, shouldst thou be silent to me, I become like them that
   go down to the grave. 2. Hear the voice of my prayers when I cry to
   thee, when I lift up my hands to the sanctuary of thy holiness.


   1. Unto thee, O Jehovah! will I cry. The Psalmist begins by declaring
   that he would betake himself to the help of God alone, which shows both
   his faith and his sincerity. Although men labor every where under a
   multitude of troubles, yet scarcely one in a hundred ever has recourse
   to God. Almost all having their consciences burdened with guilt, and
   having never experienced the power of divine grace which might lead
   them to betake themselves to it, either proudly gnaw the bit or fill
   the air with unavailing complaints, or, giving way to desperation,
   faint under their afflictions. By calling God his strength, David more
   fully shows that he confided in God's assistance, not only when he was
   in the shade and in peace, but also when he was exposed to the severest
   temptations. In comparing himself to the dead, too, he intimates how
   great his straits were, although his object was not merely to point out
   the magnitude of his danger, but also to show that when he needed
   succor, he looked not here and there for it, but relied on God alone,
   without whose favor there remained no hope for him. It is, therefore,
   as if he had said, I am nothing if thou leavest me; if thou succourest
   me not, I perish. It is not enough for one who is in such a state of
   affliction to be sensible of his misery, unless, convinced of his
   inability to help himself, and renouncing all help from the world, he
   betake himself to God alone. And as the Scriptures inform us that God
   answers true believers when he shows by his operations that he regards
   their supplications, so the word silent is set in opposition to the
   sensible and present experience of his aid, when he appears, as it
   were, not to hear their prayers.

   2. Hear the voice of my prayers when I cry to thee. This repetition is
   a sign of a heart in anguish. David's ardor and vehemence in prayer are
   also intimated by the noun signifying voice, and the verb signifying to
   cry. He means that he was so stricken with anxiety and fear, that he
   prayed not coldly, but with burning, vehement desire, like those who,
   under the pressure of grief, vehemently cry out. In the second clause
   of the verse, by synecdoche, the thing signified is indicated by the
   sign. It has been a common practice in all ages for men to lift up
   their hands in prayer. Nature has extorted this gesture even from
   heathen idolaters, to show by a visible sign that their minds were
   directed to God alone. The greater part, it is true, contented with
   this ceremony, busy themselves to no effect with their own inventions;
   but the very lifting up of the hands, when there is no hypocrisy and
   deceit, is a help to devout and zealous prayer. David, however, does
   not say here that he lifted his hands to heaven, but to the sanctuary,
   that, aided by its help, he might ascend the more easily to heaven. He
   was not so gross, or so superstitiously tied to the outward sanctuary,
   as not to know that God must be sought spiritually, and that men then
   only approach to him when, leaving the world, they penetrate by faith
   to celestial glory. But remembering that he was a man, he would not
   neglect this aid afforded to his infirmity. As the sanctuary was the
   pledge or token of the covenant of God, David beheld the presence of
   God's promised grace there, as if it had been represented in a mirror;
   just as the faithful now, if they wish to have a sense of God's
   nearness to them, should immediately direct their faith to Christ, who
   came down to us in his incarnation, that he might lift us up to the
   Father. Let us understand, then, that David clung to the sanctuary with
   no other view than that by the help of God's promise he might rise
   above the elements of the world, which he used, however, according to
   the appointment of the Law. The Hebrew word dvyr, debir, which we have
   rendered sanctuary, [594] signifies the inner-room of the tabernacle or
   temple, or the most holy place, where the ark of the covenant was
   contained, and it is so called from the answers or oracles which God
   gave forth from thence, to testify to his people the presence of his
   favor among them.

   Psalm 28:3-5

   3. Draw me not away with wicked men, nor with the workers of iniquity,
   who speak peace to their neighbors, while malice is in their hearts. 4.
   Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of
   their doings; give them according to the work of their hands; render
   them their reward. 5. Because they regard not the doings of Jehovah,
   neither the work of his hands, let him destroy them, and not build them
   up.


   3. Draw me not away with wicked men. The meaning is, that in
   circumstances so dissimilar, God should not mingle the righteous with
   the wicked in the same indiscriminate destruction. [595] Undoubtedly,
   too, in speaking of his enemies, he indirectly asserts his own
   integrity. But he did not pray in this manner, because he thought that
   God was indiscriminately and unreasonably angry with men; he reasons
   rather from the nature of God, that he ought to cherish good hope,
   because it was God's prerogative to distinguish between the righteous
   and the wicked, and to give every one his due reward. By the workers of
   iniquity, he means man wholly addicted to wickedness. The children of
   God sometimes fall, commit errors, and act amiss in one way or other,
   but they take no pleasure in their evil doings; the fear of God, on the
   contrary, stirs them up to repentance. David afterwards defines and
   enlarges upon the wickedness of those whom he describes; for, under
   pretense of friendship they perfidiously deceived good men, professing
   one thing with their tongue, while they entertained a very different
   thing in their hearts. Open depravity is easier to be borne with than
   this craftiness of the fox, when persons put on fair appearances in
   order to find opportunity of doing mischief. [596] This truth,
   accordingly, admonishes us that those are most detestable in God's
   sight, who attack the simple and unwary with fair speeches as with
   poison.

   4. Give them according to their works. Having thus requested God to
   have a regard to his innocence, the Psalmist thunders forth a curse
   against his enemies. And the accumulation of words shows that he had
   groaned long and grievously under the burden before he broke forth to
   desire such vengeance. He intimates that the wicked of whom he speaks
   had transgressed not once, nor for a short time, nor in one way, but
   that they had proceeded so far in their constant evil doings, that
   their audacity was no longer to be endured. We know how troublesome and
   grievous a temptation it is to see the ungodly proceeding without
   measure or end, as if God connived at their wickedness. David,
   therefore, wearied as it were with continual forbearing, and fainting
   under the burden, implores God, at length, to restrain the wantonness
   of his enemies, who of late ceased not to heap wickedness upon
   wickedness. Thus we perceive that there is nothing superfluous in this
   verse, when to works he adds the wickedness of their doings, and the
   work of their hands, and thrice petitions that they may receive the
   reward which they have deserved. Add to this, that he at the same time
   bears testimony to his own faith, to which boasting hypocrites often
   compel the children of God, while by their deceit and cavils, they
   impose upon the judgments of the world. We see how men who are
   distinguished for wickedness, not content with impunity themselves,
   cannot abstain from oppressing the innocent by false accusations, just
   as the wolf, desirous of making a prey [597] of the lambs, according to
   the common proverb, accused them of troubling the water. David is
   therefore compelled by this exigency to call upon God for protection.
   Here again occurs the difficult question about praying for vengeance,
   which, however, I shall despatch in few words, as I have discussed it
   elsewhere. In the first place, then, it is unquestionable, that if the
   flesh move us to seek revenge, the desire is wicked in the Sight of
   God. He not only forbids us to imprecate evil upon our enemies in
   revenge for private injuries, but it cannot be otherwise than that all
   those desires which spring from hatred must be disordered. David's
   example, therefore, must not be alleged by those who are driven by
   their own intemperate passion to seek vengeance. The holy prophet is
   not inflamed here by his own private sorrow to devote his enemies to
   destruction; but laying aside the desire of the flesh, he gives
   judgment concerning the matter itself. Before a man can, therefore,
   denounce vengeance against the wicked, he must first shake himself free
   from all improper feelings in his own mind. In the second place,
   prudence must be exercised, that the heinousness of the evils which
   offend us drive us not to intemperate zeal, which happened even to
   Christ's disciples, when they desired that fire might be brought from
   heaven to consume those who refused to entertain their Master, (Luke
   9:54.) They pretended, it is true, to act according to the example of
   Elias; but Christ severely rebuked them, and told them that they knew
   not by what spirit they were actuated. In particular, we must observe
   this general rule, that we cordially desire and labor for the welfare
   of the whole human race. Thus it will come to pass, that we shall not
   only give way to the exercise of God's mercy, but shall also wish the
   conversion of those who seem obstinately to rush upon their own
   destruction. In short, David, being free from every evil passion, and
   likewise endued with the spirit of discretion and judgment, pleads here
   not so much his own cause as the cause of God. And by this prayer, he
   farther reminds both himself and the faithful, that although the wicked
   may give themselves loose reins in the commission of every species of
   vice with impunity for a time, they must at length stand before the
   judgment-seat of God.

   5. Because they regard not the doings of Jehovah. In this verse he lays
   open the root of impiety, declaring that the ungodly are so bold to do
   mischief, because, while they are thus indulging their hatred, and
   perpetrating every species of wickedness, they think that they have
   nothing to do with God. And when conscience stings them, they soothe
   themselves with false hopes, and at last stubbornly harden themselves
   into insensibility. First, being intoxicated with prosperity, they
   flatter themselves that God is their friend, while he has no regard for
   those good men who are overwhelmed with so many afflictions; and, next,
   they persuade themselves that the world is governed by chance, thus
   blinding themselves in the midst of the clear light of day. In this
   manner, David's adversaries, willingly ignorant that God had appointed
   him to be king, emboldened themselves to persecute him. He therefore
   complains of their gross ignorance of this, just as Isaiah (Isaiah
   5:20) brings the same complaint, in general terms, against all the
   ungodly of his days. This doctrine, then, has a twofold use. First, it
   is no small consolation to the children of God to be persuaded, while
   they are unrighteously vexed, that by the providence of God they are
   thus profitably exercised to patience; and that while the affairs of
   this world are all in a state of disturbance and confusion, God
   nevertheless sits supreme in heaven conducting and governing all
   things. [598] In the second place, this is a very proper curb to subdue
   the passions of our flesh, that we may not, like the Andabates, [599]
   contend in the dark, and with shut eyes, as if God saw not and cared
   not about what is done here below. Let us, therefore, learn carefully
   to consider that the judgments which God executes are just so many
   proofs of his righteousness in governing mankind, and that although all
   things should be huddled together in confusion, the eye of faith should
   be directed to heaven, to consider God's secret judgments. And as God
   never ceases, even in the midst of the greatest darkness, to give some
   tokens of his providence, it is inexcusable indolence not to attend to
   them. This perverseness the prophet aggravates, by repeating again, the
   works of God's hands He thus intimates, that the ungodly, by recklessly
   pursuing their course, trample under foot whatever of God's works they
   may meet with to check their madness.

   Let him destroy them, and not build them up. Some are of opinion that
   the first part of this verse is the nominative in the room of a
   substantive to the verbs in the last clause; as if David had said, This
   brutal madness shall destroy them; but the name of God should rather be
   supplied, and then the context will run excellently. As the verbs,
   however, in the Hebrew are in the future tense [600] the sentence may
   be explained as meaning that David now assures himself of the
   destruction of the reprobates for which he had lately prayed. I do not
   reject this interpretation; but, in my opinion, the words are just a
   continuance of his petitions. In this way, he prays that the wicked may
   be overthrown, so as not to rise again, or recover their former state.
   The expression, Let him destroy them, and not build them up, is a
   common figure of speech among the Hebrews, according to what Malachi
   says concerning Edom, "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, They shall build,
   but I shall throw down," (Malachi 1:4.) Lest we should be struck,
   therefore, with an incurable plague, let us learn to awake our minds to
   the consideration of God's works, that we may be taught to fear him, to
   persevere in patience, and to advance in godliness.

   Psalm 28:6-8

   6. Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
   7. Jehovah is my strength and my shield, my heart hath trusted in him,
   and I have been helped: therefore shall my heart rejoice, and with my
   song will I praise him. 8. Jehovah is their strength; and he is also
   the strength of the salvations [or deliverances] of his anointed.


   6. Blessed be Jehovah, who hath heard. This is the second part of the
   psalm in which the prophet begins to give thanks to God. We have
   already seen how he employed himself in prayer in the midst of his
   dangers; and now by this thanksgiving he teaches us that his prayers
   were not in vain. Thus he confirms by his own example, that God is
   ready to bring help to his people whenever they seek him in truth and
   sincerity. He declares the same truth more fully in the next verse,
   calling God his strength and his shield; for he was persuaded that God
   had heard him from this, that he had been wonderfully preserved. He
   adds, that he had been helped in respect of his confidence and hope;
   for it often comes to pass, that those who call upon God,
   notwithstanding come short of his grace through their own unbelief.
   Thirdly, he says that he will add to his joy a testimony of his
   gratitude. Wicked men and hypocrites flee to God when they are
   overwhelmed with difficulties, but as soon as they escape from them,
   forgetting their deliverer, they rejoice with frantic mirth. In short,
   David trusted not in vain, since he truly found by experience that God
   possesses ever present power to preserve his servants; and that this
   was matter of true and solid joy to him, that he found God ever
   favorable to him. On this account, likewise, he promises that he would
   be mindful of God, and grateful to him. And undoubtedly, when God
   spreads cheerfulness through our hearts, it is to open our mouths to
   sing his praises.

   8. Jehovah is their strength. By way of explanation, he repeats what he
   had said before, that God had been his strength; namely, because he had
   blessed his armies. David had indeed employed the hand and labor of
   men, but to God alone he ascribes the victory. As he knew that whatever
   help he had obtained from men proceeded from God, and that his
   prosperous success flowed likewise from his gratuitous favor, he
   discerned his hand in these means, as palpably as if it had been
   stretched forth from heaven. And surely it is passing shameful, that
   human means, which are only the instruments of God's power, should
   obscure his glory; although there is no sin more common. It is a manner
   of speaking which has great weight, when, speaking of his soldiers, he
   uses only the pronoun their, as if he pointed to them with the finger.
   The second clause assigns the reason of the other. He declares that
   himself and his whole army were endued with victorious valor from
   heaven, because he fought under the standard of God. This is the
   meaning of the word anointed; for, had not God appointed him king, and
   freely adopted him, he would not have favored him any more than he did
   Saul. By this means, in extolling solely the power of God which
   advanced him to the kingdom, he attributes nothing to his own policy or
   power. In the meantime, we may learn, that when one is satisfied of the
   lawfulness of his calling, this doctrine encourages him to entertain
   good hope with respect to the prosperous issue of his affairs. In
   particular, it is to be observed, as we have briefly noticed in another
   place, that the fountain whence all the blessings God bestows upon us
   flows is, that he hath chosen us in Christ. David employs salvations or
   deliverances in the plural number, because he had been often and in
   various ways preserved. The meaning, therefore, is, that from the time
   when God had anointed him by the hand of Samuel, he never ceased to
   help him, but delivered him in innumerable ways, until he had
   accomplished the work of his grace in him.

   Psalm 28:9

   9. Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; feed them, and lift
   them up for ever.


   In this verse he shows that it was not so much his own welfare as the
   welfare of the whole Church which was the object of his concern, and
   that he neither lived nor reigned for himself, but for the common good
   of the people. He well knew that he was appointed king for no other
   end. In this he declares himself to be a type of the Son of God, of
   whom, when Zechariah (Zechariah 9:9) predicts that he would come
   "having salvation," there is no doubt that he promises nothing to him
   apart from his members, but that the effects of this salvation would
   diffuse themselves throughout his whole body. By this example,
   accordingly, he prescribes a rule to earthly kings, that, devoting
   themselves to the public good, they should only desire to be preserved
   for the sake of their people. [601] How very far otherwise it is, it is
   needless to say. Blinded with pride and presumption they despise the
   rest of the world, just as if their pomp and dignity raised them
   altogether above the common state of man. Nor is it to be wondered at,
   that mankind are so haughtily and contumeliously trampled under foot of
   kings, since the greatest part cast off and disdain to bear the cross
   of Christ. [602] Let us therefore remember that David is like a mirror,
   in which God sets before us the continual course of his grace. Only we
   must be careful, that the obedience of our faith may correspond to his
   fatherly love, that he may acknowledge us for his people and
   inheritance. The Scriptures often designate David by the name of a
   shepherd; but he himself assigns that office to God, thus confessing
   that he is altogether unfit for it, [603] save only in as far as he is
   God's minister.

   PSALM 29.

   David, that he may humble all men before God, from the highest to the
   lowest, celebrates his terrible power in the various wonders of nature,
   which he affirms are not less fitted to arouse us to give glory to God,
   than if he were to assert his empire and majesty with his own voice.
   After he has struck fear into the proud, who are reluctant to yield,
   and addressed an exhortation to them accompanied by a gentle reproof,
   he sweetly invites the faithful voluntarily to fear the Lord.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 29:1-4

   1. Give unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, give unto Jehovah glory
   and strength. 2. Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; [604] worship
   before Jehovah in the brightness of his sanctuary. 3. The voice of
   Jehovah is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth; Jehovah is
   upon the great waters. 4. The voice of Jehovah is in strength, the
   voice of Jehovah is in beauty.


   1. Give unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty. It was no doubt David's
   design to lead all men to worship and reverence God; but as it is more
   difficult to reduce great men, who excel in rank, to order, he
   expressly addresses himself to them. It is obvious, that the LXX, in
   giving the translation, sons of rams, [605] were led into a mistake by
   the affinity of the Hebrew words. [606] About the signification of the
   word, indeed, the Jewish commentators are all agreed; but when they
   proceed to speak of its meaning, they pervert and obscure it by the
   most chilling comments. Some expound it of the angels, [607] some of
   the stars; and others will have it, that by the great men who are
   referred to are meant the holy fathers. But David only intended to
   humble the princes of this world, who, being intoxicated with pride,
   lift up their horns against God. This, accordingly, is the reason why
   he introduces God, with a terrific voice, subduing by thunders,
   hail-storms, tempests, and lightnings, these stubborn and stiff-necked
   giants, who, if they are not struck with fear, refuse to stand in awe
   of any power in heaven. We see, therefore, why, passing by others, he
   directs his discourse particularly to the sons of the mighty. The
   reason is, because there is nothing more common with them than to abuse
   their lofty station by impious deeds, while they madly arrogate to
   themselves every divine prerogative. At least that they may modestly
   submit themselves to God, and, mindful of their frailty, place their
   dependence upon his grace, it is necessary, as it were, to compel them
   by force. David, therefore, commands them to give strength unto
   Jehovah, because, deluded by their treacherous imaginations, they think
   that the power which they possess is supplied to them from some other
   quarter than from heaven. In short, he exhorts them to lay aside their
   haughtiness, and their false opinion about their own strength, and to
   glorify God as he deserves. By the glory of God's name, (ver. 2,) he
   means that which is worthy of his majesty, of which the great men of
   this world are wont to deprive him. The repetition, also, shows that
   they must be vehemently urged ere a proper acknowledgement be extorted
   from them. By the brightness of God's sanctuary [608] is to be
   understood, not heaven as some think, but the tabernacle of the
   covenant, adorned with the symbols of the divine glory, as is evident
   from the context. And the prophet designedly makes mention of this
   place, in which the true God had manifested himself, that all men,
   bidding adieu to superstition, should betake themselves to the pure
   worship of God. It would not be sufficient to worship any heavenly
   power, but the one and unchangeable God alone must be worshipped, which
   cannot come to pass until the world be reclaimed from all foolish
   inventions and services forged in the brains of men.

   3. The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters. David now rehearses the
   wonders of nature which I have previously referred to; and well indeed
   does he celebrate the power of God as well as his goodness, in his
   works. As there is nothing in the ordinary course of nature, throughout
   the whole frame of heaven and earth, which does not invite us to the
   contemplation of God, he might have brought forward, as in Psalm 19:1,
   the sun and the stars, and the whole host of heaven, and the earth with
   its riches; but he selects only those works of God which prove not only
   that the world was at first created by him, and is governed by his
   power, but which also awaken the torpid, and drag them, as it were, in
   spite of themselves, humbly to adore him; as even Horace was compelled,
   though he was not only a heathen poet, but an Epicurean, and a vile
   contemner of Deity, to say of himself in one of his Odes, -- (Lib. I.
   Ode 34.)

   "A fugitive from heaven and prayer,
   I mocked at all religious fear,
   Deep scienced in the mazy lore
   Of mad philosophy; but now
   Hoist sail, and back my voyage plough
   To that blest harbour which I left before.

   "For, lo! that awful heavenly Sire,
   Who frequent cleaves the clouds with fire,
   Parent of day, immortal Jove;
   Late through the floating fields of air,
   The face of heaven serene and fair,
   His thund'ring steeds, and winged chariot drove," etc. [609]

   Experience, too, tells us that those who are most daring in their
   contempt of God are most afraid of thunderings, storms, and such like
   violent commotions. With great propriety, therefore, does the prophet
   invite our attention to these instances which strike the rude and
   insensible with some sense of the existence of a God, [610] and rouse
   them to action, however sluggish and regardless they are. He says not
   that the sun rises from day to day, and sheds abroad his life-giving
   beams, nor that the rain gently descends to fertilise the earth with
   its moisture; but he brings forward thunders, violent tempests, and
   such things as smite the hearts of men with dread by their violence.
   God, it is true, speaks in all his creatures, but here the prophet
   mentions those sounds which rouse us from our drowsiness, or rather our
   lethargy, by the loudness of their noise. We have said, that this
   language is chiefly directed to those who with stubborn recklessness,
   cast from them, as far as they can, all thought of God. The very
   figures which he uses sufficiently declare, that David's design was to
   subdue by fear the obstinacy which yields not willingly otherwise.
   Thrice he repeats that God's voice is heard in great and violent
   tempests, and in the subsequent verse he adds, that it is full of power
   and majesty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [604] "C'est, digne de son nom." -- Note, Fr. Marg. "That is, worthy of
   his name."

   [605] The entire reading of the verse in the Septuagint is, "Enenkate
   to Kurio huioi Theou enenkate to Kurio huious krion" "Bring to the
   Lord, ye sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams." Thus the LXX, as
   is not unusual in other places, render the words for "Ye sons of the
   mighty" twice; first, in the vocative case, addressing them, Uioi
   Theou, Ye sons of God, and then in the accusative case, huious krion,
   young rams, being apparently doubtful which was the correct rendering,
   and, therefore, putting down both. The Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic,
   exactly follow them. Jerome also reads, "Afferte Domino filios
   arietum;" although he does not give a double translation of the
   original words. But the correct rendering, we have no doubt, is, "Ye
   sons of the mighty;" which is just a Hebrew idiomatic expression for
   "Ye mighty ones," or, "Ye princes;" and to them the inspired writer
   addresses an invitation to acknowledge and worship God from the
   manifestation of his majesty and power in the wonders of nature.

   [606] The Hebrew word which Calvin renders "mighty," is 'lym, elym, a
   word which means gods. The Hebrew word 'ylym, eylim, which means rams,
   nearly resembles it, having only an additional y, yod, and this letter
   is often cut off in nouns.

   [607] The Chaldee paraphrases it thus:-- "The assembly of angels, sons
   of God," meaning by God angels.

   [608] This translation conveys a somewhat different meaning from that
   of our English version; but it is supported by several critics. Green
   reads, "In his beautiful sanctuary;" and Fry, "Worship Jehovah with
   holy reverence," or, "Worship Jehovah in the glorious places of the
   sanctuary." "Where the Hebrews read vhdrt" says Hammond, "in the glory
   or beauty of holiness, from hdr, to honor, or beautify, the LXX. read,
   en aulho hagia autou, in his holy court, as if it were from,
   "penetrale, thalamus, area, a closet, a marriage-chamber, a court; and
   so the Latin and Syriac follow them, and the Arabic, in his "holy
   habitation."

   Psalm 29:5-8

   5. The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; I say, Jehovah breaketh
   the cedars of Lebanon. 6. And he maketh Lebanon to skip like a calf,
   and Sirion like a young unicorn. 7. The voice of Jehovah striketh out
   [or heweth out] flames of fire. 8. The voice of Jehovah maketh the
   wilderness to quake, the voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness of
   Kadesh to tremble.


   5. The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars. We see how the prophet, in
   order to subdue the stubbornness of men, shows, by every word, that God
   is terrible. He also seems to rebuke, in passing, the madness of the
   proud, and of those who swell with vain presumption, because they
   hearken not to the voice of God in his thunders, rending the air with
   his lightnings, shaking the lofty mountains, prostrating and
   overthrowing the loftiest trees. What a monstrous thing is it, that
   while all the irrational portion of the creation tremble before God,
   men alone, who are endued with sense and reason, are not moved!
   Moreover, though they possess genius and learning, they employ
   enchantments to shut their ears against God's voice, however powerful,
   lest it should reach their hearts. Philosophers think not that they
   have reasoned skilfully enough about inferior causes, unless they
   separate God very far from his works. It is a diabolical science,
   however, which fixes our contemplations on the works of nature, and
   turns them away from God. If any one who wished to know a man should
   take no notice of his face, but should fix his eyes only on the points
   of his nails, his folly might justly be derided. But far greater is the
   folly of those philosophers, who, out of mediate and proximate causes,
   weave themselves vails, lest they should be compelled to acknowledge
   the hand of God, which manifestly displays itself in his works. The
   Psalmist particularly mentions the cedars of Lebanon, because lofty and
   beautiful cedars were to be found there. He also refers to Lebanon and
   Mount Hermon, and to the wilderness of Kadesh, [611] because these
   places were best known to the Jews. He uses, indeed, a highly poetical
   figure accompanied with a hyperbole, when he says, that Lebanon skips
   like a calf at God's voice, and Sirion (which is also called Mount
   Hermon [612] ) like a unicorn, which, we know, is one of the swiftest
   animals. He also alludes to the terrific noise of thunder, which seems
   almost to shake the mountains to their foundations. Similar is the
   figure, when he says, the Lord striketh out flames of fire, which is
   done when the vapours, being struck, as it were, with his hammer, burst
   forth into lightnings and thunderbolts. Aristotle, in his book on
   Meteors, reasons very shrewdly about these things, in so far as relates
   to proximate causes, only that he omits the chief point. The
   investigation of these would, indeed, be both a profitable and pleasant
   exercise, were we led by it, as we ought, to the Author of Nature
   himself. But nothing is more preposterous than, when we meet with
   mediate causes, however many, to be stopped and retarded by them, as by
   so many obstacles, from approaching God; [613] for this is the same as
   if a man were to remain at the very rudiments of things during his
   whole life, without going farther. In short, this is to learn in such a
   manner that you can never know any thing. That shrewdness alone,
   therefore, is worthy of praise, which elevates us by these means even
   to heaven, in order that not a confused noise only may strike our ears,
   but that the voice of the Lord may penetrate our hearts, and teach us
   to pray and serve God. Some expound the Hebrew word ychyl, yachil,
   which we have translated to tremble, in another way, namely, that God
   maketh the wilderness of Kadesh to travail in birth; [614] because of
   the manifold wonders which were wrought in it as the Israelites passed
   through it. But this sense I object to, as far too subtle and strained.
   David appears rather to refer to the common feelings of men; for as
   wildernesses are dreadful of themselves, they are much more so when
   they are filled with thunders, hail, and storms. I do not, however,
   object that the wilderness may be understood, by synecdoche, to mean
   the wild beasts which lodge in it; and thus the next verse, where hinds
   are mentioned, may be considered as added by way of exposition.

   Kadesh, by which it lay, Numbers 20:1, 16.

   Psalm 29:9-11

   9. The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to bring forth, and
   discovereth [or maketh bare] the forests, and in his temple every one
   speaketh of his praise. 10. Jehovah sitteth upon the flood; Jehovah, I
   say, sitteth king for ever. 11. Jehovah will give strength to his
   people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.


   9. The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to bring forth [615] A tacit
   comparison, as I have said, is here made. It is worse than irrational,
   it is monstrous, that men are not moved at God's voice, when it has
   such power and influence on wild beasts. It is base ingratitude,
   indeed, in men not to perceive his providence and government in the
   whole course of nature; but it is a detestable insensibility that at
   least his unusual and extraordinary works, which compel even wild
   beasts to obey him, will not teach them wisdom. Some interpreters think
   that hinds are mentioned, rather than other beasts, on account of their
   difficulty in bringing forth their young; which I disapprove not. The
   voice of the Lord is also said to discover or make bare the forests,
   either because there is no covering which can prevent it from
   penetrating into the most secret recesses and caverns; or, because
   lightnings, rains, and stormy winds, beat off the leaves and make the
   trees bare. Either sense is appropriate.

   In his temple. God's voice fills the whole world, and spreads itself to
   its farthest limits; but the prophet declares that his glory is
   celebrated only in his church, because God not only speaks intelligibly
   and distinctly there, but also there gently allures the faithful to
   himself. His terrible voice, which thunders in various ways in the air,
   strikes upon the ears, and causes the hearts of men to beat in such a
   manner, as to make them shrink from rather than approach him not to
   mention that a considerable portion turn a deaf ear to its sound in
   storms, rains, thunder, and lightnings. As men, therefore, profit not
   so much in this common school as to submit themselves to God, David
   wisely says especially that the faithful sing the praises of God in his
   temple, because, being familiarly instructed there by his fatherly
   voice, they devote and consecrate themselves wholly to his service. No
   man proclaims the glory of God aright but he who worships him
   willingly. This may be understood likewise as a complaint, in which
   David reproves the whole world of being silent in so far as the glory
   of God is concerned, [616] and laments that although his voice resounds
   through all regions, yet his praises are no where sung but in his
   temple alone. He appears, however, after the example of all the godly,
   to exhort the whole of mankind to praise God's name, and designedly to
   erect a temple as a receptacle for his glory, for the purpose of
   teaching us, that in order truly to know God, and praise him as is his
   due, we need another voice than that which is heard in thunders,
   showers, and storms in the air, in the mountains, and in the forests;
   for if he teach us not in plain words, and also kindly allure us to
   himself, by giving us a taste of his fatherly love, we will continue
   dumb. It is the doctrine of salvation alone, therefore, which cheers
   our hearts and opens our mouths in his praises, by clearly revealing to
   us his grace, and the whole of his will. It is from thence that we must
   learn how we ought to praise him. We may also unquestionably see that
   at that time there was nothing of the light of godliness in the whole
   world, except in Judea. Even philosophers, who appeared to approach
   nearest to the knowledge of God, contributed nothing whatever that
   might truly glorify him. All that they say concerning religion is not
   only frigid, but for the most part insipid. It is therefore in his word
   alone that there shines forth the truth which may lead us to true
   piety, and to fear and serve God aright. [617]

   10. Jehovah sitteth upon the flood. Some think that David here alludes
   to that memorable instance of God's vengeance, when he drowned the
   world at once by the flood, [618] and thus testified to all ages that
   he is the judge of mankind. I agree to this in part, but extend his
   meaning still farther. In my opinion, he prosecutes the former subject,
   putting us in mind that those floods, which still threaten destruction
   to the earth, are controlled by the providence of God in such a way, as
   to make it evident that it is he alone who governs all things at all
   times. [619] David, therefore, mentions this among other proofs of
   God's power, that even when the elements appear to be mingled and
   confounded together by the utmost fury of the weather, God controls and
   moderates these commotions from his throne in heaven. He accordingly
   adds, for the sake of explanation, God sits King for ever.

   11. Jehovah will give strength to his people. He returns to his former
   doctrine, namely, that although God exhibits his visible power to the
   view of the whole world indiscriminately, yet he exerts it in a
   peculiar manner in behalf of his elect people. Moreover, he here
   describes him in a very different manner from what he did formerly;
   that is to say, not as one who overwhelms with fear and dread those to
   whom he speaks, but as one who upholds, cherishes, and strengthens
   them. By the word strength is to be understood the whole condition of
   man. And thus he intimates that every thing necessary to the
   preservation of the life of the godly depends entirely upon the grace
   of God. He amplifies this by the word bless; for God is said to bless
   with peace those whom he treats liberally and kindly, so that nothing
   is awanting to the prosperous course of their life, and to their
   complete happiness. From this we may learn, that we ought to stand in
   awe of the majesty of God, in such a manner as, notwithstanding, to
   hope from him all that is necessary to our prosperity; and let us be
   assuredly persuaded, that since his power is infinite, we are defended
   by an invincible fortress.

   [615] Bishop Lowth reads, "Maketh the oaks to tremble," (Lectures on
   Hebrew Poetry, vol. 2, p.253,) in which he is followed by Dimock,
   Green, Seeker, Horsley, Fry, and others. But Dathe, Berlin, De Rossi,
   Dr Adam Clarke, Rogers, etc., adhere to the common interpretation, in
   which they are supported by all the ancient versions, except the
   Syriac, which seems to favor the view of Lowth. A main argument of
   Lowth and those who follow him in support of his rendering is, that the
   common translation, which supposes the passage to relate to the hinds
   bring forth their young, agrees very little with the rest of the
   imagery either in nature or dignity; whereas the oak struck with
   lightning, is a far nobler image, and one which falls in more naturally
   with the scattering of a forest's foliage under the action of a storm.
   But Rogers justly observes, that "we are not warranted in altering the
   Hebrew text, because the oriental imagery which we meet with does not
   correspond with our ideas of poetical beauty and grandeur," (Book of
   Psalms in Hebrew, metrically arranged, vol. it. p. 186.) With respect
   to the sense conveyed by the common reading, it may be observed, that
   birds bring forth their young with great difficulty and pain, bowing
   themselves, bruising their young ones, and casting out their sorrows,
   (Job 39:4, 6;) and it therefore heightens the description given of the
   terrific character of the thunder-storm, when the thunder, which is
   here called the voice of God, is represented as causing, through the
   terror which it inspires, the hinds in their pregnant state prematurely
   to drop their young; although, according to our ideas of poetical
   imagery, this may not accord so well with the other images in the
   passage nor appear so beautiful and sublime as the image of the oaks
   trembling at the voice of Jehovah.

   deluge to be inhabited," or "make the world habitable after it;" the
   Syriac, "God called back the deluge;" and the Arabic, "God restrained
   the deluge." Ainsworth reads, "Jehovah sat at the flood," and explains
   it as meaning "Noah's flood."

   PSALM 30.

   David having been delivered from great danger, not only renders thanks
   to God apart by himself, but at the same time invites and exhorts all
   the pious to perform the same duty. He then confesses that he had
   flattered himself too confidently in his prosperity, and that his
   security had justly been chastised. In the third place, having briefly
   expressed his sorrow, he returns again to thanksgiving.

   A psalm sung at the dedication of David's house.

   Interpreters doubt whether this psalm was composed by David, or by some
   of the prophets after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish
   captivity; for house means, in their opinion, the temple. But as the
   title expressly mentions David's name, it is more probable that it is
   David's private house which is here spoken of. Moreover, the
   supposition entertained by some, that when he was about to dedicate his
   palace, he was seized with heavy sickness, is founded upon no solid
   reason. We may rather conjecture from what is stated in sacred history,
   that as soon as he had built his royal palace, he dwelt in it quietly
   and at his ease. He said to the prophet Nathan, that he felt ashamed
   comfortably "to dwell within an house of cedar," while "the ark of God
   dwelt under curtains," (2 Samuel 7:2.) Besides, to restrict that to
   sickness which is here spoken generally concerning some kind of danger,
   is altogether groundless. It is more probable, that Absalom being dead,
   and his faction extinguished, and the fatal commotion which they had
   raised put down, David celebrated the divine favor toward him, as one
   who had returned from exile to his former station in his kingdom. For
   he mentions that he was chastised by God's hand, because, exulting too
   much in his happy estate, and almost intoxicated with it, he falsely
   and foolishly promised himself entire freedom from adversity. Moreover,
   when he began to inherit the magnificent and royal palace, of which I
   have just spoken, his kingdom was yet scarcely restored to peace. It
   was not yet time, therefore, for forgetfulness of human frailty to
   creep upon him, which might provoke the wrath of God, and expose him to
   dangers which might bring him to the very verge of destruction. It is
   not unreasonable, therefore, to suppose, that in this psalm he
   celebrates God's favor to him in restoring him to his former state. It
   was necessary again to dedicate his house, which had been defiled by
   the incestuous whoredoms of Absalom, and other wickednesses; and under
   this word seems to be denoted a double blessing, both his restoration
   to life and to his kingdom: as if he had said, that after settling the
   public affairs of his kingdom, he sung this song, and solemnly
   dedicated his house to God that he might live in his own family. But it
   must be briefly observed concerning this ceremony of the law, that as
   we are very slow and cold in thinking of God's benefits, this exercise
   was enjoined upon his ancient people, that they might understand that
   there is no pure and lawful use of any thing without thanksgiving to
   God. As by offering the first-fruits to God, therefore, they
   acknowledged that they received the increase of the whole year from
   him, in like manner, by consecrating their houses to God, they declared
   that they were God's tenants, confessing that they were strangers, and
   that it was he who lodged and gave them a habitation there. [620] If a
   levy for war, therefore, took place, this was a just cause of
   exemption, when any one alleged that he had not yet dedicated his
   house. [621] Besides, they were at the same time admonished by this
   ceremony, that every one enjoyed his house aright and regularly, only
   when he so regulated it that it was as it were a sanctuary of God, and
   that true piety and the pure worship of God reigned in it. The types of
   the law have now ceased, but we must still keep to the doctrine of
   Paul, that whatever things God appoints for our use, are still
   "sanctified by the word of God and prayer," (1 Timothy 4:4, 5.)

   Psalm 30:1-3

   1. I will extol thee, O Jehovah! for thou hast lifted me up, [622] and
   hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 2. O Jehovah my God! I have
   cried to thee, and thou hast healed me. 3. O Jehovah! thou hast brought
   up my soul from the grave; thou hast quickened me from among those who
   go down [623] into the pit.


   1. I will extol thee, O Jehovah! As David had been brought, as it were,
   from the grave to the life-giving air, he promises to extol the name of
   God. It is God who lifts us up with his own hand when we have been
   plunged into a profound gulf; and therefore it is our duty, on our
   part, to sing his praises with our tongues. By the foes who, he says,
   obtained no matter of rejoicing over him, we may understand both
   domestic and foreign enemies. Although wicked and evil disposed persons
   flattered him with servile adulation, they at the same time cherished
   secret hatred against him, and were ready to insult him as soon as an
   opportunity should occur. In the second verse, he concludes that he was
   preserved by the favor of God, alleging in proof of this, that when he
   was at the very point of death he directed his supplications to God
   alone, and that he immediately felt that he had not done so in vain.
   When God hears our prayers, it is a proof which enables us to conclude
   with certainty that he is the author of our salvation, and of the
   deliverance which we obtain. As the Hebrew word rph', rapha, signifies
   to heal, interpreters have been led, from this consideration, to
   restrict it to sickness. But as it is certain, that it sometimes
   signifies to restore, or to set up again, and is moreover applied to an
   altar or a house when they are said to be repaired or rebuilt, it may
   properly enough mean here any deliverance. The life of man is in danger
   in many other ways than merely from disease; and we know that it is a
   form of speech which occurs every where in the Psalms, to say that
   David was restored to life whenever the Lord delivered him from any
   grievous and extreme danger. For the sake of amplification,
   accordingly, he immediately adds, Thou hast brought up my soul from the
   grave He reckoned that he could not sufficiently express in words the
   magnitude of the favor which God had conferred upon him, unless he
   compared the darkness of that period to a grave and pit, into which he
   had been forced to throw himself hastily, to protect his life by
   hiding, until the flame of insurrection was quenched. As one restored
   to life, therefore, he proclaims that he had been marvellously
   delivered from present death, as if he had been restored to life after
   he had been dead. And assuredly, it appears from sacred history, how
   completely he was overwhelmed with despair on every side.

   Psalm 30:4-5

   4. Sing unto Jehovah, O ye who are his meek ones! and acknowledge the
   memorial of his holiness. [624] 5. For his anger is only for a moment
   [625] but life [626] is in his favor; weeping will lodge in the
   evening, and rejoicing shall come in the morning.


   4. Sing unto Jehovah. The better to testify his gratitude, David calls
   upon all the saints to join with him in singing the praises of God; and
   under one class he describes the whole body. As he had been preserved
   beyond all expectation, and by this instance had been instructed
   concerning God's continual and infinite goodness towards all the godly,
   he breaks forth into this exhortation, in which he includes the general
   deliverance of the whole church as well as his own. He rehearses not
   only what God had been to himself, but also how bountifully and
   promptly he is accustomed to assist his people. In short, confirmed by
   one particular instance he turns his thoughts to the general truth. The
   meaning of the Hebrew term chsydym, chasidim, which we have translated
   meekness, by which David often describes the faithful, has been already
   shown in the sixteenth Psalm. Their heavenly adoption ought to excite
   them to the exercise of beneficence, that they may imitate their
   Father's disposition,

   "who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," (Matthew
   5:45.)

   There is nothing in which men resemble God more truly than in doing
   good to others. The memorial of his holiness, in the second clause of
   the verse, may refer to the tabernacle; as if David had exhorted all
   the children of God to go before the ark of the covenant, which was the
   memorial of God's presence. The Hebrew letter [627] l, lamed, often
   denotes a place. I readily subscribe, however, to their opinion, who
   think that memorial signifies the same thing as name; for God has
   assuredly rendered himself worthy of remembrance by his works, which
   are a bright representation of his glory, the sight of which should
   stir us up to praise him.

   5. For his anger is only for a moment. It is beyond all controversy
   that life is opposed here to for a moment, and consequently signifies
   long continuance, or the constant progress of time from day to day.
   David thus intimates that if God at any time chastise his people, he
   not only mitigates the rigour of their punishment, but is immediately
   appeased, and moderates his anger; whereas he prolongs his kindness and
   favor for a long time. And, as I have already observed, he chose rather
   to couch his discourse in general terms, than to speak particularly of
   himself, that the godly might all perceive that this continued
   manifestation of God's favor belongs to them. We are hereby taught,
   however, with how much meekness of spirit, and with what prompt
   obedience he submitted his back to God's rod. We know that from the
   very first bloom of youth, during almost his whole life, he was so
   tried by a multiplied accumulation of afflictions, that he might have
   been accounted miserable and wretched above all other men; yet in
   celebrating the goodness of God, he acknowledges that he had been
   lightly afflicted only for a short period, and as it were in passing.
   Now, what inspired him with so great meekness and equanimity of mind
   was, that he put a greater value upon God's benefits, and submitted
   himself more quietly to the endurance of the cross, than the world is
   accustomed to do. If we are prosperous, we devour God's blessings
   without feeling that they are his, or, at least, we indolently allow
   them to slip away; but if any thing sorrowful or adverse befall us, we
   immediately complain of his severity, as if he had never dealt kindly
   and mercifully with us. In short, our own fretfulness and impatience
   under affliction makes every minute an age; while, on the other hand,
   our repining and ingratitude lead us to imagine that God's favor,
   however long it may be exercised towards us, is but for a moment. It is
   our own perversity, therefore, in reality, which hinders us from
   perceiving that God's anger is but of short duration, While his favor
   is continued towards us during the whole course of our life. Nor does
   God in vain so often declare that he is merciful and gracious to a
   thousand generations, long-suffering, slow to anger, and ready to
   forgive. And as what he says by the prophet Isaiah has a special
   reference to the kingdom of Christ, it must be daily fulfilled,

   "For a small moment have I afflicted thee, but with everlasting mercies
   will I gather thee," (Isaiah 54:7.)

   Our condition in this world, I confess, involves us in such
   wretchedness, and we are harassed by such a variety of afflictions,
   that scarcely a day passes without some trouble or grief. Moreover,
   amid so many uncertain events, we cannot be otherwise than full of
   daily anxiety and fear. Whithersoever, therefore, men turn themselves,
   a labyrinth of evils surrounds them. But however much God may terrify
   and humble his faithful servants, with manifold signs of his
   displeasure, he always be-sprinkles them with the sweetness of his
   favor to moderate and assuage their grief. If they weigh, therefore his
   anger and his favor in an equal balance, they will always find it
   verified, that while the former is but for a moment, the latter
   continues to the end of life; nay, it goes beyond it, for it were a
   grievous mistake to confine the favor of God within the boundaries of
   this transitory life. And it is unquestionably certain, [628] that none
   but those whose minds have been raised above the world by a taste of
   heavenly life really experience this perpetual and uninterrupted
   manifestation of the divine favor, which enables them to bear their
   chastisements with cheerfulness. Paul, accordingly, that he may inspire
   us with invincible patience, refers to this in 2 Corinthians 4:17,

   "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at
   the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen."

   In the meantime, it is to be observed that God never inflicts such
   heavy and continued chastisements on his people, without frequently
   mitigating them, and sweetening their bitterness with some consolation.
   Whoever, therefore, directs his mind to meditation upon the heavenly
   life, will never faint under his afflictions, however long continued;
   and, comparing them with the exceeding great and manifold favors of God
   towards him, he will put such honor on the latter as to judge that
   God's goodness, in his estimation, outweighs his displeasure a
   hundred-fold. In the second clause, David repeats the same thing
   figuratively: Weeping will lodge in the evening, and rejoicing shall
   come in the morning He does not simply mean, that the affliction would
   be only for one night, but that if the darkness of adversity should
   fall upon the people of God, as it were, in the evening, or at the
   setting of the sun, light would soon after arise upon them, to comfort
   their sorrow-stricken spirits. The amount of David's instruction is,
   that were we not too headstrong, we would acknowledge that the Lord,
   even when he appears to overwhelm us for a time with the darkness of
   affliction, always seasonably ministers matter of joy, just as the
   morning arises after the night.

   Psalm 30:6-10

   6. And in my tranquillity [629] I had said, I shall never be moved. 7.
   O Jehovah! in thy good pleasure thou hast established strength to my
   mountain: thou hast hidden thy face, I have been terrified. 8. O
   Jehovah! I cried to thee, and to my Lord [630] I made my supplication.
   9. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down into the pit? [631]
   Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 10. Hear, O
   Jehovah! and have mercy upon me: O Jehovah! Be thou my helper.


   6. And in my tranquillity I had said. This is the confession which I
   formerly mentioned, in which David acknowledges that he had been justly
   and deservedly punished for his foolish and rash security, in
   forgetting his mortal and mutable condition as a man, and in setting
   his heart too much on prosperity. By the term tranquillity, he means
   the quiet and flourishing state of his kingdom. Some translate the
   Hebrew word slvh, shiluah, which we have rendered tranquillity, by
   abundance, in which sense it is often used in other places; but the
   word tranquillity agrees better with the context; as if David had said,
   When fortune smiled upon me on every side, and no danger appeared to
   occasion fear, my mind sunk as it were into a deep sleep, and I
   flattered myself that my happy condition would continue, and that
   things would always go on in the same course. This carnal confidence
   frequently creeps upon the saints when they indulge themselves in their
   prosperity, and so to speak, wallow upon their dunghill. [632] Hence
   Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:18) compares himself to a wild bullock before the
   Lord tamed him and accustomed him to the yoke. This may at first sight
   appear to be but a small crime, yet we may gather from its punishment
   how much it is displeasing to God; nor will we wonder at this when we
   consider the root from which it springs and the fruits which it bears.
   As deaths innumerable continually hover before our eyes, and as there
   are so many examples of change to awaken us to fear and caution, those
   must be bewitched with devilish pride who persuade themselves that
   their life is privileged above the common lot of the world. They see
   the whole earth jumbled together in undistinguishing variety, and its
   individual parts in a manner tossed hither and thither; and yet, as if
   they did not belong to the human race, they imagine that they shall
   always continue stable and liable to no changes. Hence that wantonness
   of the flesh, with which they so licentiously indulge their lusts;
   hence their pride and cruelty, and neglect of prayer. How indeed should
   those flee to God, who have no sense of their need to instigate or move
   them to that? The children of God have also a pious security of their
   own, which preserves their minds in tranquillity amidst the troublesome
   storms of the world; like David, who, although he had seen the whole
   world made to shake, yet leaning upon the promise of God, was bound to
   hope well concerning the continuance of his kingdom. But although the
   faithful, when raised aloft on the wings of faith, despise adversity,
   yet, as they consider themselves liable to the common troubles of life,
   they lay their account with enduring them, -- are every hour prepared
   to receive wounds, -- shake off their sluggishness, and exercise
   themselves in the warfare to which they know that they were appointed,
   - and with humility and fear put themselves under God's protection; nor
   do they consider themselves safe anywhere else than under his hand. It
   was otherwise with David, who, when ensnared by the allurements of his
   prosperous state, promised himself unbroken tranquillity not from the
   word of God but from his own feelings. The same thing also occurred to
   the pious King Hezekiah, who, although lately afflicted with a sore
   disease, as soon as all was well and according to his wish, was hurried
   by the vanity of the flesh to pride and vain boasting, (2 Chronicles
   32:24.) By this we are taught to be on our guard when in prosperity,
   that Satan may not bewitch us with his flatteries. The more bountifully
   God deals with any one, the more carefully ought he to watch against
   such snares. It is not, indeed, probable that David had become so
   hardened as to despise God and defy all misfortunes, like many of the
   great men of this world, who, when immersed among their luxuries and
   surfeitings, insolently scoff at all God's judgments; but an effeminate
   listlessness having come over his mind, he became more lukewarm in
   prayer, nor did he depend on the favor of God; in short, he put too
   much confidence in his uncertain and transitory prosperity.

   7. O Jehovah! of thy good pleasure. This verse describes the difference
   which exists between the confidence which is founded upon the word of
   God and the carnal security which springs from presumption. True
   believers, when they rely upon God, are not on that account neglectful
   of prayer. On the contrary, looking carefully at the multitude of
   dangers by which they are beset, and the manifold instances of human
   frailty which pass before their eyes, they take warning from them, and
   pour out their hearts before God. The prophet now failed in duty as to
   this matter; because, by anchoring himself on his present wealth and
   tranquillity, or spreading his sails to the prosperous winds, he
   depended not on the free favor of God in such a manner as to be ready
   at any time to resign into his hands the blessings which he had
   bestowed upon him. The contrast should be observed between that
   confidence of stability which arises from the absence of trouble, and
   that which rests upon the gracious favor of God. When David says that
   strength was established to his mountain, some interpreters expound it
   of mount Zion. Others understand by it a stronghold or fortified tower,
   because in old time fortresses were usually built upon mountains and
   lofty places. I understand the word metaphorically to signify a solid
   support, and therefore readily admit that the prophet alludes to mount
   Zion. David thus blames his own folly, because he considered not, as he
   ought to have done, that there was no stability in the nest which he
   had formed for himself, but in God's good will alone.

   Thou hast hidden thy face. Here he confesses, that, after he was
   deprived of God's gifts, this served to purge his mind as it were by
   medicine from the disease of perverse confidence. A marvellous and
   incredible method surely, that God, by hiding his face, and as it were
   bringing on darkness, should open the eyes of his servant, who saw
   nothing in the broad light of prosperity. But thus it is necessary that
   we be violently shaken, in order to drive away the delusions which both
   stifle our faith and hinder our prayers, and which absolutely stupify
   us with a soothing infatuation. And if David had need of such a remedy,
   let us not presume that we are endued with so good a state of heart as
   to render it unprofitable for us to be in want, in order to remove from
   us this carnal confidence, which is as it were diseased repletion which
   would otherwise suffocate us. We have, therefore, no reason to wonder,
   though God often hides his face from us, when the sight of it, even
   when it shines serenely upon us, makes us so wretchedly blind.

   8. O Jehovah! I cried unto thee. Now follows the fruit of David's
   chastisement. He had been previously sleeping profoundly, and fostering
   his indolence by forgetfulness; but being now awakened all on a sudden
   with fear and terror, he begins to cry to God. As the iron which has
   contracted rust cannot be put to any use until it be heated again in
   the fire, and beaten with the hammer, so in like manner, when carnal
   security has once got the mastery, no one can give himself cheerfully
   to prayer, until he has been softened by the cross, and thoroughly
   subdued. And this is the chief advantage of afflictions, that while
   they make us sensible of our wretchedness, they stimulate us again to
   supplicate the favor of God.

   9. What profit is there in my blood? Some explain the verse after this
   manner: What will it avail me to have lived, unless thou prolongest my
   life till I shall have finished the course of my vocation? But this
   exposition seems too strained, especially as the term blood here
   signifies death, not life: as if David had said, What profit wilt thou
   derive from my death? This interpretation is farther confirmed by the
   following clause, where he complains that his lifeless body will then
   be useless for celebrating the praises of God. And he seems expressly
   to mention the truth of God, to intimate that it would be unsuitable to
   the character of God to take him out of the world by an untimely death,
   before God had accomplished the promise which he had made to him
   concerning his future heir. As there is a mutual relation between God's
   promises and our faith, truth is, as it were, the medium by which God
   openly shows that he does not merely make liberal promises to us in
   words, to feed us with empty hopes, and afterwards to disappoint us.
   Moreover, to obtain a longer life, David draws an argument from the
   praises of God, to celebrate which we are born and nourished: as if he
   had said, For what purpose hast thou created me, O God! but that
   through the whole course of my life I may be a witness and a herald of
   thy grace to set forth the glory of thy name? But my death will cut
   short the continuance of this exercise, and reduce me to eternal
   silence. A question, however, arises here, Does not, it may be said,
   the death of true believers glorify God as well as their life? We
   answer, David speaks not simply of death, but adds a circumstance which
   I have already treated of in the sixth Psalm. As God had promised him a
   successor, the hope of living longer being taken from him, he had good
   reason to be afraid lest this promise should be frustrated by his
   death, and was therefore compelled to exclaim, What profit is there in
   my blood? It highly concerned the glory of God that he should be
   preserved alive, until by obtaining his desire, he should be able to
   bear witness to God's faithfulness in completely fulfilling his promise
   to him. By inquiring in the end of the verse, Shall the dust praise
   thee? he does not mean that the dead are altogether deprived of power
   to praise God, as I have already shown in the sixth Psalm. If the
   faithful, while encumbered with a burden of flesh, exercise themselves
   in this pious duty, how should they desist from it when they are
   disencumbered, and set free from the restraints of the body? It ought
   to be observed, therefore, that David does not professedly treat of
   what the dead do, or how they are occupied, but considers only the
   purpose for which we live in this world, which is this, that we may
   mutually show forth to one another the glory of God. Having been
   employed in this exercise to the end of our life, death at length comes
   upon us and shuts our mouth.

   10. Hear, O Jehovah! In this clause the Psalmist softens and corrects
   his former complaint; for it would have been absurd to expostulate with
   God like one who despaired of safety, and to leave off in this fretful
   temper. Having asked, therefore, with tears, what profit God would
   derive from his death, he encourages himself to a more unconstrained
   manner of prayer, and, conceiving new hope, calls upon God for mercy
   and help. He puts God's favor, however, in the first place, from whom
   alone he could expect the help which he implored.

   Psalm 30:11-12

   11. Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my
   sackcloth, and girded me with gladness. 12. That my glory may sing
   praise to thee, and not be silent: O Jehovah my God! I will set forth
   thy praise for ever.


   11. Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing. David concludes the
   psalm as he had begun it, with thanksgiving. He affirms that it was by
   the help and blessing of God that he had escaped safe; and he then
   adds, that the final object of his escape was, that he might employ the
   rest of his life in celebrating the praises of God. Moreover, he shows
   us that he was not insensible or obdurate under his afflictions, but
   mourned in heaviness and sorrow; and he also shows that his very
   mourning had been the means of leading him to pray to God to deprecate
   his wrath. Both these points are most worthy of our observation, in
   order, first, that we may not suppose that the saints are guilty of
   stoical insensibility, depriving them of all feeling of grief; and,
   secondly, that we may perceive that in their mourning they were
   exercised to repentance. This latter he denotes by the term sackcloth.
   It was a common practice among the ancients to clothe themselves with
   sackcloth when mourning, [633] for no other reason, indeed, than that
   like guilty criminals, they might approach their heavenly Judge,
   imploring his forgiveness with all humility, and testifying by this
   clothing their humiliation and dissatisfaction with themselves. [634]
   We know also that the orientals were addicted beyond all others to
   ceremonies. We perceive, therefore, that David, although he patiently
   submitted himself to God, was not free from grief. We also see that his
   sorrow was "after a godly sort," as Paul speaks, (2 Corinthians 7:10;)
   for to testify his penitence he clothed himself with sackcloth. By the
   term dancing, he does not mean any wanton or profane leaping, but a
   sober and holy exhibition of joy like that which sacred Scripture
   mentions when David conveyed the ark of the covenant to its place, (2
   Samuel 6:16.) If we may conjecture, however, we may gather from this,
   that the great danger of which David speaks in this psalm is by some
   improperly restricted to sickness, as it was very improbable that he
   would put on sackcloth when he was confined to a sick-bed. This,
   indeed, would not be a sufficient reason of itself, but in a doubtful
   case, as this is, it is not destitute of force. David therefore means,
   that, laying aside his mourning apparel, he returned from a state of
   heaviness and sorrow to joy; and this he ascribes to the grace of God
   alone, asserting that he had been his deliverer.

   12. That my glory may sing praise to thee. In this verse he more fully
   expresses his acknowledgement of the purpose for which God had
   preserved him from death, and that he would be careful to render him a
   proper return of gratitude. Some refer the word glory to the body, and
   some to the soul, or the higher powers of the mind. Others, as the
   pronoun my, which we have supplied, is not in the Hebrew text, prefer
   to translate it in the accusative case, supplying the word every man,
   in this way: That every man may celebrate thy glory; as if the prophet
   had said, This is a blessing worthy of being celebrated by the public
   praises of all men. But as all these interpretations are strained, I
   adhere to the sense which I have given. The Hebrew word kvvd, kebod,
   which signifies glory, it is well known, is sometimes employed
   metaphorically to signify the tongue, as we have seen in Psalm 16:9.
   And as David adds immediately after, I will celebrate thy praise for
   ever, the context demands that he should particularly speak of his own
   duty in this place. His meaning, therefore, is, O Lord, as I know that
   thou hast preserved me for this purpose, that thy praises may resound
   from my tongue, I will faithfully discharge this service to thee, and
   perform my part even unto death. To sing, and not be silent, is a
   Hebrew amplification; as if he had said, My tongue shall not be mute,
   or deprive God of his due praise; it shall, on the contrary, devote
   itself to the celebration of his glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [633] This custom was not confined to the Israelites. It was practiced
   also among the heathen nations. An instance of this is recorded in
   Jonah 3:5-8. It appears from Plutarch, that this was also sometimes
   practiced among the Greeks. The Hebrew word for sackcloth is sq, sak;
   and it is remarkable that the word sak exists in various languages,
   denoting the same thing. It shows the unaffected character of real
   sorrow, leading men to neglect the adorning of their persons, when we
   find several nations manifesting it by wearing the same dismal garb,
   and employing a word of the same sound to express it.

   PSALM 31.

   David, having been delivered from some great danger, or rather from
   many dangers, first relates the prayers which he had offered up to God
   amidst the terrors of death. He then subjoins his thanksgiving, which
   is no ordinary one; for he celebrates his deliverance at great length,
   and exhorts all the saints to be of good hope, as they had in him a
   most excellent and memorable example of God's goodness.

   To the chief musician. A psalm of David.

   Psalm 31:1-4

   1. In thee, O Jehovah! have I put my trust, let me not be ashamed for
   ever: deliver me in thy righteousness. 2. Incline thine ear unto me,
   deliver me speedily; be unto me a strong rock, a house of defense to
   save me. 3. For thou art my rock and my fortress: and for thy name's
   sake thou wilt lead and guide me. [635] 4. Pluck me out of the net
   which they have hidden for me; for thou art my strength.


   1. In thee, O Jehovah! have I put my trust. Some are of opinion that
   this psalm was composed by David, after he had most unexpectedly
   escaped out of the wilderness of Maon; to which I do not object,
   although it is only a doubtful conjecture. Certainly he celebrates one
   or more of the greatest of his dangers. In the commencement he tells us
   what kind of prayer he offered in his agony and distress; and its
   language breathes affection of the most ardent nature. He takes it for
   a ground of hope that he trusted in the Lord, or continued to trust in
   him; for the verb in the past tense seems to denote a continued act. He
   held it as a principle, that the hope which depends upon God cannot
   possibly be disappointed. Meanwhile, we see how he brings forward
   nothing but faith alone; promising himself deliverance only because he
   is persuaded that he will be saved by the help and favor of God. But as
   this doctrine has been expounded already, and will yet occur oftener
   than once, it is sufficient at present to have glanced at it. Oh! that
   all of us would practice it in such a manner as that, whenever we
   approach to God, we may be able with David to declare that our prayers
   proceed from this source, namely, from a firm persuasion that our
   safety depends on the power of God. The particle signifying for ever
   may be explained in two ways. As God sometimes withdraws his favor, the
   meaning may not unsuitably be, Although I am now deprived of thy help,
   yet cast me not off utterly, or for evermore. Thus David, wishing to
   arm himself with patience against his temptations, would make a
   contrast between these two things, -- being in distress for a time, and
   remaining in a state of confusion. [636] But if any one choose rather
   to understand his words in this way, "Whatever afflictions befall me,
   may God be ready to help me, and ever and anon stretch forth his hand
   to me, as the case requires," I would not reject this meaning any more
   than the other. David desires to be delivered in the righteousness of
   God, because God displays his righteousness in performing his promise
   to his servants. It is too much refinement of reasoning to assert that
   David here betakes himself to the righteousness which God freely
   bestows on his people, because his own righteousness by works was of no
   avail. Still more out of place is the opinion of those who think that
   God preserves the saints according to his righteousness; that is to
   say, because having acted so meritoriously, justice requires that they
   should obtain their reward. It is easy to see from the frequent use of
   the term in The Psalms, that God's righteousness means his
   faithfulness, in the exercise of which he defends all his people who
   commit themselves to his guardianship and protection. David, therefore,
   confirms his hope from the consideration of the nature of God, who
   cannot deny himself, and who always continues like himself.

   2. incline thine ear unto me. These words express with how much ardor
   David's soul was stimulated to pray. He affects no splendid or ornate
   language, as rhetoricians are wont to do; but only describes in
   suitable figures the vehemence of his desire. In praying that he may be
   delivered speedily there is shown the greatness of his danger, as if he
   had said, All will soon be over with my life, unless God make haste to
   help me. By the words, house of defense, fortress, and rock, he
   intimates, that, being unable to resist his enemies, his hope rests
   only on the protection of God.

   3. For thou art my rock. This verse may be read as one sentence, thus:
   As thou art like a tower for my defense, for thy name's sake direct and
   guide me during my whole life. And thus the conjunction, as in many
   similar cases, would be superfluous. But I rather prefer a different
   sense, namely, that David, by interjecting this reflection, encourages
   himself not only to earnestness in prayer, but also in the confident
   hope of obtaining his requests. We know, at all events, that it is
   usual with him to mingle such things in his prayers as may serve to
   remove his doubts, and to confirm his assurance. Having, therefore,
   expressed his need, he assures himself, in order to encourage and
   animate himself, that his prayer shall certainly have a happy answer.
   He had formerly said, Be thou my strong rock and fortress; and now he
   adds, Assuredly thou art my rock, and my fortress: intimating, that he
   did not throw out these words rashly, like unbelievers, who, although
   they are accustomed to ask much from God, are kept in suspense by the
   dread of uncertain events. From this he also draws another
   encouragement, that he shall have God for his guide and governor during
   the whole course of his life. He uses two words, lead and guide, to
   express the same thing, and this he does (at least so I explain it) on
   account of the various accidents and unequal vicissitudes by which the
   lives of men are tried: as if he had said, Whether I must climb the
   steep mountain, or struggle along through rough places, or walk among
   thorns, I trust that thou wilt be my continual guide. Moreover, as men
   will always find in themselves matter for doubt, if they look to their
   own merits, [637] David expressly asks that God may be induced to help
   him for his own name's sake, or from regard to his own glory, as,
   properly speaking, there is no other thing which can induce him to aid
   us. It must therefore be remembered, that God's name, as it is opposed
   to all merit whatever, is the only cause of our salvation. In the next
   verse, under the metaphor of a net, he appears to designate the snares
   and artifices with which his enemies encompassed him. We know that
   conspiracies were frequently formed against his life, which would have
   left him no room for escape; and as his enemies were deeply skilled in
   policy, and hating him with an inconceivable hatred, were eagerly bent
   on his destruction, it was impossible for him to be saved from them by
   any human power. On this account he calls God his strength; as if he
   had said, He alone is sufficient to rend asunder all the snares with
   which he sees his afflicted people entangled.

   Psalm 31:5-8

   5. Into thy hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me, O
   Jehovah! God of truth. 6. I hate all that give heed to lying vanities;
   but I have trusted in Jehovah. 7. I will be glad and rejoice in thy
   goodness, because thou hast regarded my affliction: thou hast known my
   soul in distresses. 8. And thou hast not shut me up in the hand of mine
   enemy: [638] thou hast set my feet in a large place.


   5. Into thy hand I commit my spirit. David again declares his faith to
   God, and affirms that he had such high thoughts of his providence, as
   to cast all his cares upon it. Whoever commits himself into God's hand
   and to his guardianship, not only constitutes him the arbiter of life
   and death to him, but also calmly depends on him for protection amidst
   all his dangers. The verb is in the future tense, "I will commit," and
   it unquestionably denotes a continued act, and is therefore fitly
   translated into the present tense. It is also to be observed, that no
   man can possibly commit his life to God with sincerity, but he who
   considers himself exposed to a thousand deaths, and that his life hangs
   by a thread, or differs almost nothing from a breath which passes
   suddenly away. David being thus at the point of despair, leaves nothing
   to himself to do but this -- to go on his way, trusting in God as the
   keeper and governor of his life. It is marvellous, that, although many
   things distress us all, scarcely one in a hundred is so wise as to
   commit his life into God's hand. Multitudes live from day to day as
   merry and careless as if they were in a quiet nest, free from all
   disturbance; but as soon as they encounter any thing to terrify them,
   they are ready to die for anguish. It thus happens that they never
   betake themselves to God, either because they deceive themselves with
   vain delusions, flattering themselves that all will yet be well, [639]
   or because they are so stricken with dread and stupified with
   amazement, that they have no desire for his fatherly care. Farther, as
   various tempests of grief disturb us, and even sometimes throw us down
   headlong, or drag us from the direct path of duty, or at least remove
   us from our post, the only remedy which exists for setting these things
   at rest is to consider that God, who is the author of our life, is also
   its preserver. This, then, is the only means of lightening all our
   burdens, and preserving us from being swallowed up of over-much sorrow.
   Seeing, therefore, that God condescends to undertake the care of our
   lives, and to support them, although they are often exposed to various
   sorts of death, let us learn always to flee to this asylum; nay, the
   more that any one is exposed to dangers, let him exercise himself the
   more carefully in meditating on it. In short, let this be our shield
   against all dangerous attacks -- our haven amidst all tossings and
   tempests -- that, although our safety may be beyond all human hope, God
   is the faithful guardian of it; and let this again arouse us to prayer,
   that he would defend us, and make our deliverance sure. This confidence
   will likewise make every man forward to discharge his duty with
   alacrity, and constantly and fearlessly to struggle onward to the end
   of his course. How does it happen that so many are slothful and
   indifferent, and that others perfidiously forsake their duty, but
   because, overwhelmed with anxiety, they are terrified at dangers and
   inconveniences, and leave no room for the operation of the providence
   of God?

   To conclude, whoever relies not on the providence of God, so as to
   commit his life to its faithful guardianship, has not yet learned
   aright what it is to live. On the other hand, he who shall entrust the
   keeping of his life to God's care, will not doubt of its safety even in
   the midst of death. We must therefore put our life into God's hand, not
   only that he may keep it safely in this world, but also that he may
   preserve it from destruction in death itself, as Christ's own example
   has taught us. As David wished to have his life prolonged amidst the
   dangers of death, so Christ passed out of this transitory life that his
   soul might be saved in death. This is a general prayer, therefore, in
   which the faithful commit their lives to God, first, that he may
   protect them by his power, so long as they are exposed to the dangers
   of this world; and, secondly, that he may preserve them safe in the
   grave, where nothing is to be seen but destruction. We ought farther to
   assure ourselves, that we are not forsaken of God either in life or in
   death; for those whom God brings safely by his power to the end of
   their course, he at last receives to himself at their death. This is
   one of the principal places of Scripture which are most suitable for
   correcting distrust. It teaches us, first, that the faithful ought not
   to torment themselves above measure with unhappy cares and anxieties;
   and, secondly, that they should not be so distracted with fear as to
   cease from performing their duty, nor decline and faint in such a
   manner as to grasp at vain hopes and deceitful helps, nor give way to
   fears and alarms; and, in fine, that they should not be afraid of
   death, which, though it destroys the body, cannot extinguish the soul.
   This, indeed, ought to be our principal argument for overcoming all
   temptations, that Christ, when commending his soul to his Father,
   undertook the guardianship of the souls of all his people. Stephen,
   therefore, calls upon him to be his keeper, saying, "Lord Jesus,
   receive my spirit," (Acts 7:59.) As the soul is the seat of life, it is
   on this account, as is well known, used to signify life.

   Thou hast redeemed me. Some translate the past tense here into the
   future; but, in my opinion, without any reason. For it is evident to
   me, that David is here encouraging himself to continued confidence in
   God, by calling to remembrance the proofs of his favor which he had
   already experienced. [640] It is no small encouragement to us for the
   future, to be assuredly persuaded that God will watch over our life,
   because he hath been our deliverer already. Hence the epithet by which
   David recognises God. He calls him true or faithful, because he
   believes that he will continue the same to him for ever that he has
   already been. Accordingly, this is as it were a bond by which he joins
   to the former benefits which God had conferred upon him confidence in
   prayer, and the hope of aid for the time to come: as if he had said,
   Lord, thou who art ever the same, and changest not thy mind like men,
   hast already testified in very deed that thou art the defender of my
   life: now, therefore, I commit my life, of which thou hast been the
   preserver, into thy hands. What David here declares concerning his
   temporal life, Paul transfers to eternal salvation.

   "I know," says he, "whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is
   able to keep that which I have committed to him,"
   (2 Timothy 1:12.)

   And surely, if David derived so much confidence from temporal
   deliverance, it is more than wicked and ungrateful on our part, if the
   redemption purchased by the blood of Christ does not furnish us with
   invincible courage against all the devices of Satan.

   6. I hate all that give heed to lying vanities. In order the better to
   express that his faith was firmly fixed on God, he affirms that he was
   free from the vile affections which usually turn away our minds from
   God, and under which unbelievers for the most part labor. For we know
   that by contrasting things which are opposite, a subject is better
   illustrated. To restrict the Hebrew word hvl, hebel, which we have
   rendered vanities, to magical arts, as some interpreters do, is absurd.
   [641] I confess, indeed, that the Orientals were so much addicted to
   these impostures, that it was a common evil among them. But as the
   devices by which Satan ensnares the minds of men, and the allurements
   by which he draws them away from God, are innumerable, it is not at all
   probable that the prophet mentions one species only. Whatever vain
   hopes, therefore, we form to ourselves, which may draw us off from our
   confidence in God, David generally denominates vanities, yea, false or
   lying vanities, because, although they feed us for a time with
   magnificent promises, in the end they beguile and disappoint us. He
   affirms, therefore, that casting away the vanities which men usually
   invent to support their hopes, he relies solely on God. And as men not
   only intoxicate themselves personally with the deceitful allurements of
   the world, but in this respect also deceive one another, the prophet
   expressly declares, with a view that we may carefully avoid them,
   unless we wish to be wilfully entangled in their dangerous toils, that
   he hated all who involved themselves in such lies. The second clause, I
   have trusted in Jehovah, must be read in connection with the first,
   because it both assigns the cause of his hatred of lying vanities, and
   shows that it is impossible for men to have any true faith in God,
   unless they abhor whatever would draw them away from him.

   7. I will be glad and rejoice in thy goodness. Here is inserted a
   thanksgiving, although many are rather of opinion that David's prayer
   is suspended, and that he makes a vow, when he shall be delivered from
   present danger. But as no condition is annexed, I am rather inclined to
   think that stopping all at once in the middle of his prayer, he
   promises himself a deliverance, for which he will have abundant matter
   for giving thanks. Nor is it to be wondered at that different feelings
   are mingled in the psalms in which David has set forth his own
   temptations, as well as the resistance which his faith made to them,
   considering also that when he sung the praises of God, after having
   already obtained deliverance from him, he embraces different periods in
   his song, as he here says, that God had regarded his affliction,
   intimating by this the effect of the assistance which God had afforded
   him. And that he may the better confirm this, he adds, that he had not
   been delivered into the hands of his enemies: in which words there is
   an implied antithesis, namely, that when he was encompassed on every
   side by severe afflictions, he was marvellously delivered by God. This
   is also farther intimated by the following sentence, Thou hast set my
   feet in a large place, [642] which denotes a sudden and unexpected
   change.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [638] Dr Geddes observes, that this is the literal translation of the
   Hebrew words; "but," says he, "as negative propositions in Hebrew are
   often equivalent in sense to opposite positives, I deemed it better to
   use an equivalent as more agreeable to what precerdes and follows." His
   rendering is, "Rescued me from the hand of mine enemy."

   [639] "Se faisans a croire que de leur faict ce ne sera que triomphe."
   -- Fr.

   [640] Horsley, while his translation is similar to that of Calvin,
   "Thou hast delivered me," takes a somewhat different view of the
   meaning. "Thou hast, i.e., Thou most surely wilt. -- The thing is as
   certain as if it were done."

   [641] Hammond considers "vanities" as referring to the practice of
   superstitiously having recourse to auguries and divinations for advice
   and direction, a practice which prevailed among the heathen, when they
   met with any difficulty or danger. To the responses of augury, they
   showed the greatest regard; although they were deceived and
   disappointed in the confidence which they reposed in them. David
   declares that he detested all such practices, and trusted for aid to
   God alone. French and Skinner, by lying vanities, understand idols.
   "Idols," says Walford, "are often thus denominated; though the term is
   not to be confined to this sense, as all the pursuits of iniquity may
   be justly comprehended under it. - Vide Deuteronomy 32:21; Jonah 2:8."

   [642] "There is a contrast in the expression between the straits to
   which he had been confined, and the freedom which was now bestowed upon
   him." -- Walford.

   Psalm 31:9-13

   9. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! for I am in trouble: mine eye, my
   soul, and my belly, are consumed by reason of anger. 10. For my life is
   wasted by reason of grief, and my years with groaning; my strength
   faileth in my sorrow, and my bones are consumed. 11. I was a reproach
   by reason of all mine enemies, yea, exceedingly to my neighbors, and a
   fear to my acquaintances; and they who saw me abroad fled from me. 12.
   I am forgotten as one dead, I am become like a broken vessel. 13. For I
   have heard the railing of many, [643] and fear encloseth me on every
   side, while they consult together against me, and plot to take away my
   life.


   9. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! To move God to succor him, he
   magnifies the greatness of his misery and grief by the number of his
   complaints; not that God needs arguments to persuade him, but because
   he allows the faithful to deal familiarly with him, that they may
   disburden themselves of their cares. The greater the number of
   afflictions with which they are oppressed, the more do they encourage
   themselves, while bewailing them before God, in the hope of obtaining
   his assistance. These forms of expression may seem hyperbolical, but it
   is obvious that it was David's purpose to declare and set forth what he
   had felt in his own person. First, he says that his eyes, his soul, and
   his belly, were consumed with grief. From this it appears that it was
   neither lightly nor for a short time that he was thus tormented and
   vexed by these calamities. Indeed, he was endued with so much meekness
   of spirit that he would not allow himself to be excited easily, and by
   a slight circumstance, nor vexed by immoderate sorrow. He had also been
   for a long time inured to the endurance of troubles. We must,
   therefore, admit that his afflictions were incredibly severe, when he
   gave way to such a degree of passion. By the word anger, too, he shows
   that he was not at all times of such iron-like firmness, or so free
   from sinful passion, as that his grief did not now and then break forth
   into an excess of impetuosity and keenness. Whence we infer that the
   saints have often a severe and arduous conflict with their own
   passions; and that although their patience has not always been free
   from peevishness, yet by carefully wrestling against it, they have at
   last attained this much, that no accumulation of troubles has
   overwhelmed them. By life some understand the vital senses, an
   interpretation which I do not altogether reject. But I prefer to
   explain it as simply meaning, that, being consumed with grief, he felt
   his life and his years sliding away and failing. And by these words
   again, David bewails not so much his pusillanimity of mind as the
   grievousness of his calamities; although he was by no means ashamed to
   confess his infirmity, for which he was anxiously seeking a remedy.
   When he says, that his strength failed under his sorrow, some
   interpreters prefer reading, under his iniquity; and I confess that the
   Hebrew word vn, on, bears both significations, [644] nay, more
   frequently it signifies an offense or a fault. But as it is sometimes
   used for punishment, I have chosen the sense which appears most
   agreeable to the context. And although it is true that David was
   accustomed to ascribe the afflictions which he at any time suffered to
   his own fault, yet, as he is only recounting his miseries here, without
   mentioning the cause of them, it is probable that, according to his
   usual manner, he expresses the same thing twice by different words.

   11. I was a reproach by reason of all mine enemies. Others translate
   thus - more than mine enemies, and as the Hebrew letter m, mem, is
   often used as a sign of comparison, they interpret this clause to mean
   that David's friends and acquaintances reproached him more than all his
   enemies. But, in my opinion, he intended to express a different idea,
   namely, that as he was everywhere hated, and his enemies had induced
   almost the whole realm to take part with them against him, he had an
   evil name even among his friends and neighbors; just as popular
   opinion, like a violent tempest, usually carries all before it. I
   suppose, therefore, that the Hebrew copula v, vau, is used for the sake
   of amplification, to show that David was an object of detestation, not
   only to strangers to whom he was formerly unknown, but also to his
   principal friends. He adds, likewise, that when they saw him abroad
   they fled from him By the adverb, abroad, he means to say, that they
   did not think the miserable man worthy of a near approach to them; nay,
   that they fled from the very sight of him, at however great a distance,
   lest the contagion of his misery should reach them, and because they
   reckoned it would be injurious and disgraceful to them to show him any
   sign of friendship.

   12. I am forgotten as one dead. The Psalmist still pursues the same
   idea, and complains that he was as completely blotted out of all men's
   remembrance as if he had been dead. The memory of some men after their
   death flourishes for a time among survivors, but it more frequently
   vanishes; for there is no longer any intercourse between the quick and
   the dead, nor can the living be of any farther service to the dead.
   David illustrates this idea by the metaphor of a broken vessel, [645]
   which denotes utter contempt and meanness; as if he had said, that he
   was accounted no longer worthy of any place or respect. He adds, in
   fine, that he was railed upon by the multitude, and agitated with
   terrors. I would, however, prefer translating the Hebrew word rvym,
   rabbim, by the great, [646] rather than by many. When great men, who
   are often as powerful in judgment as in authority, slander and defame
   us as wicked persons, this adds to the indignity with which we are
   treated, because, whatever they say in condemnation of us has the
   effect of prejudicing the common people against us. It will therefore
   be very suitable to understand the words as meaning that David was
   ignominiously condemned by the whole order of the nobility; and thus
   the innocence of this afflicted man was thrown into the shade by their
   greatness. This interpretation is confirmed by what immediately
   follows:-- Fear encloseth me on every side, [647] while they consult
   together against me. As he is still speaking of the same persons, it is
   certain that this language applies more appropriately to the nobles
   than to the common people. Moreover, we see that the primary object of
   the wicked in the deceitful counsels by which they conspired to destroy
   David, was to create among the whole people hatred against him as a
   wicked and reprobate man. We also see that while they mangled his
   reputation, they did it in such a manner as that they covered their
   wickedness under the appearance of grave and considerate procedure, in
   consulting among themselves to destroy him as a man who no longer ought
   to be tolerated on the earth. It is not to be wondered at, therefore,
   that his mind was wounded, as we have just seen, by so many and so
   sharp temptations.

   Psalm 31:14-18

   14. Yet have I trusted in thee, O Jehovah! I have said, Thou art my
   God. 15. My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine
   enemies, and from them that persecute me. 16. Make thy face to shine
   upon thy servant; preserve me in thy goodness. 17. O Jehovah! let me
   not be ashamed; for I have called on thee: let the wicked be ashamed,
   let them be silent in the grave. 18. Let lying lips be put to silence,
   which speak a hard [or grievous] thing against the just, in pride and
   scorn.


   14. Yet have I trusted in thee, O Jehovah! The rendering properly is,
   And I have trusted in thee; but the Hebrew copulative particle v, vau,
   and, is used here instead of the adversative particle yet, or
   nevertheless. David, setting the steadfastness of his faith in
   opposition to the assaults of the temptations of which he has made
   mention, denies that he had ever fainted, but rather maintains, on the
   contrary, that he stood firm in his hope of deliverance from God. Nor
   does this imply that he boasted of being so magnanimous and courageous
   that he could not be overthrown through the infirmity of the flesh.
   However contrary to one another they appear, yet these things are often
   joined together, as they ought to be, in the same person, namely, that
   while he pines away with grief, and is deprived of all strength, he is
   nevertheless supported by so strong a hope that he ceases not to call
   upon God. David, therefore, was not so overwhelmed in deep sorrow, and
   other direful sufferings, as that the hidden light of faith could not
   shine inwardly in his heart; nor did he groan so much under the weighty
   load of his temptations, as to be prevented from arousing himself to
   call upon God. He struggled through many obstacles to be able to make
   the confession which he here makes. He next defines the manner of his
   faith, namely, that he reflected with himself thus that God would never
   fail him nor forsake him. Let us mark his manner of speech: I have
   said, Thou art my God In these words he intimates that he was so
   entirely persuaded of this truth, that God was his God, that he would
   not admit even a suggestion to the contrary. And until this persuasion
   prevails so as to take possession of our minds, we shall always waver
   in uncertainty. It is, however, to be observed, that this declaration
   is not only inward and secret - made rather in the heart than with the
   tongue - but that it is directed to God himself, as to him who is the
   alone witness of it. Nothing is more difficult, when we see our faith
   derided by the whole world, than to direct our speech to God only, and
   to rest satisfied with this testimony which our conscience gives us,
   that he is our God. And certainly it is an undoubted proof of genuine
   faith, when, however fierce the waves are which beat against us, and
   however sore the assaults by which we are shaken, we hold fast this as
   a fixed principle, that we are constantly under the protection of God,
   and can say to him freely, Thou art our God.

   15. My times are in thy hand. That he might the more cheerfully commit
   the preservation of his person to God, he assures us, that, trusting to
   his divine guardianship, he did not trouble himself about those casual
   and unforeseen events which men commonly dread. The import of his
   language is, Lord, it is thy prerogative, and thou alone hast the
   power, to dispose of both my life and my death. Nor does he use the
   plural number, in my opinion, without reason; but rather to mark the
   variety of casualties by which the life of man is usually harassed. It
   is a cold exposition to restrict the phrase, my times, to the time
   which he had to live, as if David meant no more than that his time or
   his days on earth were in God's hand. On the contrary, I am of opinion
   that, while he mused on the various revolutions and manifold dangers
   which continually hang over us, and the manifold unlooked-for events
   which from time to time happen, he nevertheless confidently reposed
   upon the providence of God, which he believed to be, according to the
   common saying, the arbiter both of good and of evil fortune. In the
   first clause we see that he not only denominates God the governor of
   the world in general, but also affirms that his life is in his hand;
   and not only so, but that to whatever agitations it might be subjected,
   and whatever trials and vicissitudes might befall him, he was safe
   under his protection. On this he founds his prayer, that God would
   preserve and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.

   16. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. We have said formerly, and
   we shall see in many instances hereafter, that this form of speech is
   taken from the common apprehension of men, who think that God regards
   them not, unless he really show his care of them by its effects.
   According to the judgment of sense, afflictions hide his countenance,
   just as clouds obscure the brightness of the sun. David therefore
   supplicates that God, by affording him immediate assistance, would make
   it evident to him that he enjoyed his grace and favor, which it is not
   very easy to discern amidst the darkness of afflictions. Now, God is
   said to lift the light of his countenance upon us in two ways; either
   when he opens his eyes to take care of our affairs, or when he shows to
   us his favor. These two things are indeed inseparable, or rather, the
   one depends upon the other. But by the first mode of speech, we,
   according to our carnal conceptions, attribute to God a mutability
   which, properly speaking, does not belong to him: whereas the second
   form of speech indicates, that our own eyes, rather than the eyes of
   God, are shut or heavy when he seems to have no regard to our
   afflictions. By the word preserve David explains what he meant by the
   former expression; but as there was at that time no way of safety
   apparent to him, he encourages himself to hope for it by setting before
   him the goodness of God.

   17. O Jehovah! let me not be ashamed. In these words, the Psalmist
   continues his prayer, and to strengthen his hopes, he contrasts himself
   with his enemies; for it would have been more than absurd to permit
   those who by their wickedness so openly provoked the wrath of God to
   escape with impunity, and that one who was innocent and relied upon God
   should be disappointed and made a laughing-stock. Here, accordingly, we
   perceive what the Psalmist's comparison implies. Moreover, instead of
   speaking of his hope or trust, he now speaks of his calling upon God,
   saying, I have called on thee; and he does this with good reason, for
   he who relies on the providence of God must flee to him with prayers
   and strong cries. To be silent in the grave, implies that death, when
   it befalls the ungodly, restrains and prevents them from doing farther
   injury. This silence is opposed both to their deceitful and treacherous
   devices, and to their outrageous insolence. In the very next verse,
   therefore, he adds, Let lying lips be put to silence, which, in my
   opinion, includes both their craftiness, and the false pretences and
   calumnies by which they endeavor to accomplish their designs, and also
   the vain boasting in which they indulge themselves. For he tells us
   that they speak with harshness and severity against the righteous, in
   pride and scorn; because it was their froward conceit, which almost
   always begets contempt, that made David's enemies so bold in lying.
   Whoever proudly arrogates to himself more than is his due, will almost
   necessarily treat others with contempt.

   Psalm 31:19-21

   19. O how great is thy goodness which thou hast hidden [648] for them
   that fear thee! which thou hast performed for them that trust in thee
   before the sons of men! 20. Thou shalt hide them in the secret [or, in
   the hiding-place] of thy countenance from the pride of man; thou shalt
   hide them as in a tent from the strife of tongues. 21. Blessed be
   Jehovah! for he hath made wonderful his goodness towards me, as in a
   fortified city.


   19. O how great is thy goodness which thou hast hidden for them that
   fear thee! In this verse the Psalmist exclaims that God is
   incomprehensibly good and beneficent towards his servants. Goodness
   here means those divine blessings which are the effects of it. The
   interrogatory form of the sentence has a peculiar emphasis; for David
   not only asserts that God is good, but he is ravished with admiration
   of the goodness which he had experienced. It was this experience,
   undoubtedly, which caused him break out into the rapturous language of
   this verse; for he had been marvellously and unexpectedly delivered
   from his calamities. By his example, therefore, he enjoins believers to
   rise above the apprehension of their own understanding, in order that
   they may promise themselves, and expect far more from the grace of God
   than human reason is able to conceive. He says that the goodness of God
   is hidden for his servants, because it is a treasure which is peculiar
   to them. It, no doubt, extends itself in various ways to the
   irreligious and unworthy, and is set before them indiscriminately; but
   it displays itself much more plenteously and clearly towards the
   faithful, because it is they alone who enjoy all God's benefits for
   their salvation. God

   "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,"
   (Matthew 5:45,)

   and shows himself bountiful even to the irrational creation; but he
   declares himself a Father, in the true and full sense of the term, to
   those only who are his servants. It is not without reason, therefore,
   that the goodness of God is said to be hidden for the faithful, whom
   alone he accounts worthy of enjoying his favor most intimately and
   tenderly. Some give a more subtle interpretation of the phrase, the
   goodness of God is hidden, explaining it as meaning that God, by often
   exercising his children with crosses and afflictions, hides his favor
   from them, although, at the same time, he does not forget them. It is
   more probable, however, that it should be understood of a treasure
   which God has set apart and laid up in store for them, unless perhaps
   we choose to refer it to the experience of the saints, because they
   alone, as I have said, experience in their souls the fruit of divine
   goodness; whereas brutish stupidity hinders the wicked from
   acknowledging God as a beneficent Father, even while they are devouring
   greedily his good things. And thus it comes to pass, that while the
   goodness of God fills and overspreads all parts of the world, it is
   notwithstanding generally unknown. But the mind of the sacred writer
   will be more clearly perceived from the contrast which exists between
   the faithful and those who are strangers to God's love. As a provident
   man will regulate his liberality towards all men in such a manner as
   not to defraud his children or family, nor impoverish his own house, by
   spending his substance prodigally on others; so God, in like manner, in
   exercising his beneficence to aliens from his family, knows well how to
   reserve for his own children that which belongs to them as it were by
   hereditary right; that is to say, because of their adoption. [649] The
   attempt of Augustine to prove from these words that those who
   unbelievingly dread God's judgment have no experience of his goodness,
   is most inappropriate. To perceive his mistaken view of the passage, it
   is only necessary to look to the following clause, in which David says
   that God makes the world to perceive that he exercises inestimable
   goodness towards those who serve him, both in protecting them and in
   providing for their welfare. Whence we learn, that it is not of the
   everlasting blessedness which is reserved for the godly in heaven that
   the Psalmist here speaks, but of the protection and other blessings
   which belong to the preservation of the present life; which he declares
   to be so manifest that even the ungodly themselves are forced to become
   eye-witnesses of them. The world, I admit, passes over all the works of
   God with its eyes shut, and is especially ignorant of his fatherly care
   of the saints; still it is certain that there shine forth such daily
   proofs of it, that even the reprobate cannot but see them, except in so
   far as they willingly shut their eyes against the light. David,
   therefore, speaks according to truth, when he declares that God gives
   evidences of his goodness to his people before the sons of men, that it
   may be clearly seen that they do not serve him unadvisedly or in vain.
   [650]

   20. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy countenance. In this
   verse the Psalmist specially commends the grace of God, because it
   preserves and protects the faithful against all harm. As Satan
   assiduously and by innumerable means opposes their welfare, and as the
   greater part of the world is at deadly war with them, they must be
   exposed to many dangers. Unless God, therefore, protected them by his
   power, and came from time to time to their aid, their condition would
   be most miserable. The Psalmist makes an allusion to the hiding which
   he had just mentioned, and although the metaphor may, at first sight,
   appear somewhat harsh, it very aptly expresses, that provided the Lord
   take care of them, the faithful are perfectly safe under his protection
   alone. By this eulogium, therefore, he sublimely extols the power of
   divine Providence, because it alone suffices to ward off every species
   of evil, and while it shines upon the godly, it blinds the eyes of all
   the wicked, and weakens their hands. [651] In the opinion of some, the
   Psalmist, when he speaks of the secret of God's countenance, refers to
   the sanctuary, an interpretation which I do not altogether reject,
   although it does not appear to me sufficiently solid. Again, he says
   that God hides the faithful from the pride of man and the strife of
   tongues, because, if God restrain not the wicked, we know that they
   have the audacity to break forth with outrageous violence against the
   truly godly; but however unbridled their lust and insolence may be, God
   preserves his people from harm, by wondrously covering them with the
   brightness of his countenance. Some translate the Hebrew word ryksym,
   rikasim, conspiracies, [652] others perversities, but without any
   reason; nor, indeed, does the etymology of the word admit of it, for it
   comes from a root which signifies to lift up, or to elevate. To pride
   is added the strife of tongues, because God's children have cause to
   fear not only the inhuman deeds of their enemies, but also their still
   more wicked and violent calumnies, as David himself more than enough
   experienced. And as our innocence ought to be justly dearer to us than
   our life, let us learn to cultivate uprightness in such a manner as
   that, trusting to God's protection, we may disregard every false
   calumny. And let us always remember that it is God's peculiar
   prerogative to vindicate his people from all unjust reproaches.

   21. Blessed be Jehovah! These general truths the Psalmist here proceeds
   to apply to his own circumstances, and he declares that the goodness of
   God in preserving his life was wondrously displayed. As he speaks of
   aid which had been suddenly and unexpectedly afforded him in very
   desperate circumstances, those interpreters judge aright who here
   supply as, the mark of similitude, [653] in this way, as in a fortified
   city David lay open to every blow, and had been exposed to every sort
   of injury, and he boasts that in his nakedness and destitution the
   assistance of God had been of greater service to him than a city well
   fortified, or an impregnable fortress would have been.

   Psalm 31:22-24

   22. And I said in my fear [654] I am cast out of thy sight: yet truly
   thou hast heard the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
   23. O love Jehovah, all ye his meek ones! Jehovah preserveth the
   faithful, and plentifully [655] recompenseth him who behaveth himself
   proudly. 24. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart,
   all ye who hope in Jehovah.


   22. And I said in my fear. David here confesses that for his distrust
   he deserved to be deserted by God and left to perish. It is true that
   to confess this before men he felt to be a shameful thing; but that he
   may the more fully illustrate the grace of God to him, he hesitates not
   to publish the shame of his fault. He repeats almost the same
   acknowledgement in Psalm 116:11, "I said in my haste, All men are
   liars." I am aware that the Hebrew word chphz, chaphaz, is explained by
   some as meaning flight; as if David, in fleeing from death, because he
   was unable to make resistance, was stricken with this fear. But I refer
   it rather to his trouble of mind. Whether, therefore, we translate it
   haste or fear, it means that he had been, as it were, carried headlong
   to entertain the thought that he was neglected by God. And this haste
   is opposed to calm and deliberate consideration; for although David was
   stricken with fear, he did not faint under the trial, and this
   persuasion did not continue fixed in his mind. For we know that the
   faithful are often disquieted by fears and the heat of impatience, or
   driven headlong as it were by their too hasty or precipitate wishes,
   but afterwards they come to themselves. That David's faith had never
   been overthrown by this temptation appears from the context, for he
   immediately adds, that God had heard the voice of his supplications;
   but if his faith had been extinguished, he could not have brought his
   mind earnestly to engage in prayer, and therefore this complaint was
   only a lapse of the tongue uttered in haste. Now if peevish hastiness
   of thought could drive this holy prophet of God, a man who was adorned
   with so many excellencies, to despair, how much reason have we to fear,
   lest our minds should fail and fatally ruin us? This confession of
   David, as we have already observed, serves to magnify the grace of God;
   but at the same time he sufficiently shows, in the second clause of the
   verse, that his faith, although severely shaken, had not been
   altogether eradicated, because he ceased not meanwhile to pray. The
   saints often wrestle in this manner with their distrust, that partly
   they may not despond, and that partly they may gather courage and
   stimulate themselves to prayer. Nor does the weakness of the flesh,
   even when they are almost overthrown, hinder them from showing that
   they are unwearied and invincible champions before God. But although
   David stoutly resisted temptation, he nevertheless acknowledges himself
   unworthy of God's grace, of which he in some measure deprived himself
   by his doubt. For the Hebrew particle 'kn, aken, is here to be
   understood adversatively and rendered yet, intimating that David had
   been preserved without any desert of his own, inasmuch as God's
   immeasurable goodness strove with his unbelief. But as it is a sign of
   affirmation in Hebrew, I have thought proper to translate it, Yet
   truly. I have no doubt that he opposes his language to the various
   temptations with which, it is probable, his mind had been driven hither
   and thither.

   23. O love Jehovah, all ye his meek ones! In my opinion, the Psalmist
   does not here exhort the saints to fear and reverence God, as many
   think, but encourages them to confide in him; or, in other words, to
   devote themselves wholly to him, to put all their hope in him, and to
   rely entirely upon him, without seeking to any other. Whence is it that
   our own fond devices delight us, but because we do not delight in God
   so much as we ought, and because our affections do not cleave to him?
   This love of God, therefore, comprehends in it all the desires of the
   heart. By nature, all men greatly desire to be in a prosperous or happy
   state; but while the greater number are fascinated by the allurements
   of the world, and prefer its lies and impostures, scarcely one in a
   hundred sets his heart on God. The reason which immediately follows
   confirms this interpretation; for the inspired Psalmist exhorts the
   meek to love God, because he preserves the faithful, which is as if he
   had desired them to rest satisfied with his guardianship, and to
   acknowledge that in it they had sufficient succor. [656] In the
   meantime, he admonishes them to keep a good conscience, and to
   cultivate uprightness, since God promises to preserve only such as are
   upright and faithful. On the other hand, he declares that he
   plentifully recompenses the proud, in order that when we observe them
   succeeding prosperously for a time, an unworthy emulation may not
   entice us to imitate them, and that their haughtiness, and the outrage
   they commit, while they think they are at liberty to do what they
   please, may not crush and break our spirits. The amount of the whole is
   this, Although the ungodly flatter themselves, while they proceed in
   their wickedness with impunity, and believers are harassed with many
   fears and dangers, yet devote yourselves to God, and rely upon his
   grace, for he will always defend the faithful, and reward the proud as
   they deserve. Concerning the meaning of the Hebrew word l-ytr,
   al-yether, which we have rendered plentifully, [657] interpreters are
   not agreed. Some translate it pride, meaning that to those who behave
   themselves proudly, God will render according to their pride; others
   translate it to overflowing, or beyond measure, because ytr, yether,
   signifies in Hebrew residue or remnant; instead of which I have
   translated it plentifully. Some understand it as extending to their
   children and children's children, who shall remain the residue of their
   seed. Besides, as the same word is frequently used for excellence,
   [658] I have no doubt that the prophet elegantly rebukes the proud, who
   imagine that their fancied excellence is not only a shield to them,
   but, an invincible fortress against God. As their groundless authority
   and power blind, or rather bewitch them, so that they vaunt themselves
   intemperately and without measure against those who are lowly and
   feeble, the prophet elegantly says that there is a reward in store for
   them proportioned to the haughtiness with which they are puffed up.

   24. Be of good courage. This exhortation is to be understood in the
   same way as the preceding; for the steadfastness which the Psalmist
   here enjoins is founded on the love of God of which he had spoken, when
   renouncing all the enticements of the world, we embrace with our whole
   hearts the defense and protection which he promises to us. Nor is his
   exhortation to courage and firmness unnecessary; because, when any one
   begins to rely on God, he must lay his account with and arm himself for
   sustaining many assaults from Satan. We are first, then, calmly to
   commit ourselves to the protection and guardianship of God, and to
   endeavor to have the experience of his goodness pervading our whole
   minds. Secondly, thus furnished with steady firmness and unfailing
   strength, we are to stand prepared to sustain every day new conflicts.
   As no man, however, is able of himself to sustain these conflicts,
   David urges us to hope for and ask the spirit of fortitude from God, a
   matter particularly worthy of our notice. For hence we are taught, that
   when the Spirit of God puts us in mind of our duty, he examines not
   what each man's ability is, nor does he measure men's services by their
   own strength, but stimulates us rather to pray and beseech God to
   correct our defects, as it is he alone who can do this.

   PSALM 32.

   David having largely and painfully experienced what a miserable thing
   it is to feel God's hand heavy on account of sin, exclaims that the
   highest and best part of a happy life consists in this, that God
   forgives a man's guilt, and receives him graciously into his favor.
   After giving thanks for pardon obtained, he invites others to
   fellowship with him in his happiness, showing, by his own example, the
   means by which this may be obtained.

   A Psalm of David giving instruction.

   The title of this psalm gives some idea of its subject. Some think that
   the Hebrew word mskyl, maskil, which we have rendered giving
   instruction, [659] is taken from verse 7th; [660] but it is more
   accurate to consider it as a title given to the psalm in accordance
   with its whole scope and subject matter. David, after enduring long and
   dreadful torments, when God was severely trying him, by showing him the
   tokens of his wrath, having at length obtained favor, applies this
   evidence of the divine goodness for his own benefit, and the benefit of
   the whole Church, that from it he may teach himself and them what
   constitutes the chief point of salvation. All men must necessarily be
   either in miserable torment, or, which is worse, forgetting themselves
   and God, must continue in deadly lethargy, until they are persuaded
   that God is reconciled towards them. Hence David here teaches us that
   the happiness of men consists only in the free forgiveness of sins, for
   nothing can be more terrible than to have God for our enemy; nor can he
   be gracious to us in any other way than by pardoning our
   transgressions.

   Psalm 32:1-2

   1. Blessed are they whose iniquity is forgiven, and whose transgression
   is covered. 2. Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah imputeth no sin, and
   in whose spirit there is no guile.


   1. Blessed are they whose iniquity is forgiven. This exclamation
   springs from the fervent affection of the Psalmist's heart as well as
   from serious consideration. Since almost the whole world turning away
   their thoughts from God's judgment, bring upon themselves a fatal
   forgetfulness, and intoxicate themselves with deceitful pleasures;
   David, as if he had been stricken with the fear of God's wrath, that he
   might betake himself to Divine mercy, awakens others also to the same
   exercise, by declaring distinctly and loudly that those only are
   blessed to whom God is reconciled, so as to acknowledge those for his
   children whom he might justly treat as his enemies. Some are so blinded
   with hypocrisy and pride, and some with such gross contempt of God,
   that they are not at all anxious in seeking forgiveness, but all
   acknowledge that they need forgiveness; nor is there a man in existence
   whose conscience does not accuse him at God's judgment-seat, and gall
   him with many stings. This confession, accordingly, that all need
   forgiveness, because no man is perfect, and that then only is it well
   with us when God pardons our sins, nature herself extorts even from
   wicked men. But in the meantime, hypocrisy shuts the eyes of
   multitudes, while others are so deluded by a perverse carnal security,
   that they are touched either with no feelings of Divine wrath, or with
   only a frigid feeling of it.

   From this proceeds a twofold error: first, that such men make light of
   their sins, and reflect not on the hundredth part of their danger from
   God's indignation; and, secondly, that they invent frivolous expiations
   to free themselves from guilt and to purchase the favor of God. Thus in
   all ages it has been everywhere a prevailing opinion, that although all
   men are infected with sin, they are at the same time adorned with
   merits which are calculated to procure for them the favor of God, and
   that although they provoke his wrath by their crimes, they have
   expiations and satisfactions in readiness to obtain their absolution.
   This delusion of Satan is equally common among Papists, Turks, Jews,
   and other nations. Every man, therefore, who is not carried away by the
   furious madness of Popery, will admit the truth of this statement, that
   men are in a wretched state unless God deal mercifully with them by not
   laying their sins to their charge. But David goes farther, declaring
   that the whole life of man is subjected to God's wrath and curse,
   except in so far as he vouchsafes of his own free grace to receive them
   into his favor; of which the Spirit who spake by David is an assured
   interpreter and witness to us by the mouth of Paul, (Romans 4:6.) Had
   Paul not used this testimony, never would his readers have penetrated
   the real meaning of the prophet; for we see that the Papists, although
   they chant in their temples, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are
   forgiven," etc., yet pass over it as if it were some common saying and
   of little importance. But with Paul, this is the full definition of the
   righteousness of faith; as if the prophet had said, Men are then only
   blessed when they are freely reconciled to God, and counted as
   righteous by him. The blessedness, accordingly, that David celebrates
   utterly destroys the righteousness of works. The device of a partial
   righteousness with which Papists and others delude themselves is mere
   folly; and even among those who are destitute of the light of heavenly
   doctrine, no one will be found so mad as to arrogate a perfect
   righteousness to himself, as appears from the expiations, washings, and
   other means of appeasing God, which have always been in use among all
   nations. But yet they do not hesitate to obtrude their virtues upon
   God, just as if by them they had acquired of themselves a great part of
   their blessedness.

   David, however, prescribes a very different order, namely, that in
   seeking happiness, all should begin with the principle, that God cannot
   be reconciled to those who are worthy of eternal destruction in any
   other way than by freely pardoning them, and bestowing upon them his
   favor. And justly does he declare that if mercy is withheld from them,
   all men must be utterly wretched and accursed; for if all men are
   naturally prone only to evil, until they are regenerated, their whole
   previous life, it is obvious, must be hateful and loathsome in the
   sight of God. Besides, as even after regeneration, no work which men
   perform can please God unless he pardons the sin which mingles with it,
   they must be excluded from the hope of salvation. Certainly nothing
   will remain for them but cause for the greatest terror. That the works
   of the saints are unworthy of reward because they are spotted with
   stains, seems a hard saying to the Papists. But, in this they betray
   their gross ignorance in estimating, according to their own
   conceptions, the judgment of God, in whose eyes the very brightness of
   the stars is but darkness. Let this therefore remain an established
   doctrine, that as we are only accounted righteous before God by the
   free remission of sins, this is the gate of eternal salvation; and,
   accordingly, that they only are blessed who rely upon God's mercy. We
   must bear in mind the contrast which I have already mentioned between
   believers who, embracing the remission of sins, rely upon the grace of
   God alone, and all others who neglect to betake themselves to the
   sanctuary of Divine grace.

   Moreover, when David thrice repeats the same thing, this is no vain
   repetition. It is indeed sufficiently evident of itself that the man
   must be blessed whose iniquity is forgiven; but experience teaches us
   how difficult it is to become persuaded of this in such a manner as to
   have it thoroughly fixed in our hearts. The great majority, as I have
   already shown you, entangled by devices of their own, put away from
   them, as far as they can, the terrors of conscience and all fear of
   Divine wrath. They have, no doubt, a desire to be reconciled to God;
   and yet they shun the sight of him, rather than seek his grace
   sincerely and with all their hearts. Those, on the other hand, whom God
   has truly awakened so as to be affected with a lively sense of their
   misery, are so constantly agitated and disquieted that it is difficult
   to restore peace to their minds. They taste indeed God's mercy, and
   endeavor to lay hold of it, and yet they are frequently abashed or made
   to stagger under the manifold assaults which are made upon them. The
   two reasons for which the Psalmist insists so much on the subject of
   the forgiveness of sins are these, - that he may, on the one hand,
   raise up those who are fallen asleep, inspire the careless with
   thoughtfulness, and quicken the dull; and that he may, on the other
   hand, tranquillise fearful and anxious minds with an assured and steady
   confidence. To the former, the doctrine may be applied in this manner:
   "What mean ye, O ye unhappy men! that one or two stings of conscience
   do not disturb you? Suppose that a certain limited knowledge of your
   sins is not sufficient to strike you with terror, yet how preposterous
   is it to continue securely asleep, while you are overwhelmed with an
   immense load of sins?" And this repetition furnishes not a little
   comfort and confirmation to the feeble and fearful. As doubts are often
   coming upon them, one after another, it is not sufficient that they are
   victorious in one conflict only. That despair, therefore, may not
   overwhelm them amidst the various perplexing thoughts with which they
   are agitated, the Holy Spirit confirms and ratifies the remission of
   sins with many declarations.

   It is now proper to weigh the particular force of the expressions here
   employed. Certainly the remission which is here treated of does not
   agree with satisfactions. God, in lifting off or taking away sins, and
   likewise in covering and not imputing them, freely pardons them. On
   this account the Papists, by thrusting in their satisfactions and works
   of supererogation as they call them, bereave themselves of this
   blessedness. Besides, David applies these words to complete
   forgiveness. The distinction, therefore, which the Papists here make
   between the remission of the punishment and of the fault, by which they
   make only half a pardon, is not at all to the purpose. Now, it is
   necessary to consider to whom this happiness belongs, which may be
   easily gathered from the circumstance of the time. When David was
   taught that he was blessed through the mercy of God alone, he was not
   an alien from the church of God; on the contrary, he had profited above
   many in the fear and service of God, and in holiness of life, and had
   exercised himself in all the duties of godliness. And even after making
   these advances in religion, God so exercised him, that he placed the
   alpha and omega of his salvation in his gratuitous reconciliation to
   God. Nor is it without reason that Zacharias, in his song, represents
   "the knowledge of salvation" as consisting in knowing "the remission of
   sins," (Luke 1:77.) The more eminently that any one excels in holiness,
   the farther he feels himself from perfect righteousness, and the more
   clearly he perceives that he can trust in nothing but the mercy of God
   alone. Hence it appears, that those are grossly mistaken who conceive
   that the pardon of sin is necessary only to the beginning of
   righteousness. As believers are every day involved in many faults, it
   will profit them nothing that they have once entered the way of
   righteousness, unless the same grace which brought them into it
   accompany them to the last step of their life. Does any one object,
   that they are elsewhere said to be blessed "who fear the Lord," "who
   walk in his ways," "who are upright in heart," etc., the answer is
   easy, namely, that as the perfect fear of the Lord, the perfect
   observance of his law, and perfect uprightness of heart, are nowhere to
   be found, all that the Scripture anywhere says, concerning blessedness,
   is founded upon the free favor of God, by which he reconciles us to
   himself.

   2. In whose spirit there is no guile. In this clause the Psalmist
   distinguishes believers both from hypocrites and from senseless
   despisers of God, neither of whom care for this happiness, nor can they
   attain to the enjoyment of it. The wicked are, indeed, conscious to
   themselves of their guilt, but still they delight in their wickedness;
   harden themselves in their impudence, and laugh at threatenings; or, at
   least, they indulge themselves in deceitful flatteries, that they may
   not be constrained to come into the presence of God. Yea, though they
   are rendered unhappy by a sense of their misery, and harassed with
   secret torments, yet with perverse forgetfulness they stifle all fear
   of God. As for hypocrites, if their conscience as any time stings them,
   they soothe their pain with ineffectual remedies: so that if God at any
   time cite them to his tribunal, they place before them I know not what
   phantoms for their defense; and they are never without coverings
   whereby they may keep the light out of their hearts. Both these classes
   of men are hindered by inward guile from seeking their happiness in the
   fatherly love of God. Nay more, many of them rush frowardly into the
   presence of God, or puff themselves up with proud presumption, dreaming
   that they are happy, although God is against them. David, therefore,
   means that no man can taste what the forgiveness of sins is until his
   heart is first cleansed from guile. What he means, then, by this term,
   guile, may be understood from what I have said. Whoever examines not
   himself, as in the presence of God, but, on the contrary, shunning his
   judgment, either shrouds himself in darkness, or covers himself with
   leaves, deals deceitfully both with himself and with God. It is no
   wonder, therefore, that he who feels not his disease refuses the
   remedy. The two kinds of this guile which I have mentioned are to be
   particularly attended to. Few may be so hardened as not to be touched
   with the fear of God, and with some desire of his grace, and yet they
   are moved but coldly to seek forgiveness. Hence it comes to pass, that
   they do not yet perceive what an unspeakable happiness it is to possess
   God's favor. Such was David's case for a time, when a treacherous
   security stole upon him, darkened his mind, and prevented him from
   zealously applying himself to pursue after this happiness. Often do the
   saints labor under the same disease. If, therefore, we would enjoy the
   happiness which David here proposes to us, we must take the greatest
   heed lest Satan, filling our hearts with guile, deprive us of all sense
   of our wretchedness, in which every one who has recourse to subterfuges
   must necessarily pine away.

   Psalm 32:3-4

   3. When I kept silence, my bones wasted away, and when I cried out all
   the day. 4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; and my
   greenness was turned into the drought of summer.


   3. When I kept silence, my bones wasted away. Here David confirms, by
   his own experience, the doctrine which he had laid down; namely, that
   when humbled under the hand of God, he felt that nothing was so
   miserable as to be deprived of his favor: by which he intimates, that
   this truth cannot be rightly understood until God has tried us with a
   feeling of his anger. Nor does he speak of a mere ordinary trial, but
   declares that he was entirely subdued with the extremest rigour. And
   certainly, the sluggishness of our flesh, in this matter, is no less
   wonderful than its hardihood. If we are not drawn by forcible means, we
   will never hasten to seek reconciliation to God so earnestly as we
   ought. In fine, the inspired writer teaches us by his own example, that
   we never perceive how great a happiness it is to enjoy the favor of
   God, until we have thoroughly felt from grievous conflicts with inward
   temptations, how terrible the anger of God is. He adds, that whether he
   was silent, or whether he attempted to heighten his grief by his crying
   and roaring, [661] his bones waxed old; in other words, his whole
   strength withered away. From this it follows, that whithersoever the
   sinner may turn himself, or however he may be mentally affected, his
   malady is in no degree lightened, nor his welfare in any degree
   promoted, until he is restored to the favor of God. It often happens
   that those are tortured with the sharpest grief who gnaw the bit, and
   inwardly devour their sorrow, and keep it enclosed and shut up within,
   without discovering it, although afterwards they are seized as with
   sudden madness, and the force of their grief bursts forth with the
   greater impetus the longer it has been restrained. By the term silence,
   David means neither insensibility nor stupidity, but that feeling which
   lies between patience and obstinacy, and which is as much allied to the
   vice as to the virtue. For his bones were not consumed with age, but
   with the dreadful torments of his mind. His silence, however, was not
   the silence of hope or obedience, for it brought no alleviation of his
   misery.

   4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me. In this verse he
   explains more fully whence such heavy grief arose; namely, because he
   felt the hand of God to be sore against him. The greatest of all
   afflictions is to be so heavily pressed with the hand of God, that the
   sinner feels he has to do with a Judge whose indignation and severity
   involve in them many deaths, besides eternal death. David, accordingly,
   complains that his moisture was dried up, not merely from simply
   meditating on his sore afflictions, but because he had discovered their
   cause and spring. The whole strength of men fails when God appears as a
   Judge and humbles and lays them prostrate by exhibiting the signs of
   his displeasure. Then is fulfilled the saying of Isaiah,

   "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord
   bloweth upon it." (Isaiah 40:7)

   The Psalmist, moreover, tells us, that it was no common chastisement by
   which he had been taught truly to fear the divine wrath; for the hand
   of the Lord ceased not to be heavy upon him both day and night. From a
   child, indeed, he had been inspired with the fear of God, by the secret
   influence of the Holy Spirit, and had been taught in true religion and
   godliness by sound doctrine and instruction. And yet so insufficient
   was this instruction for his attainment of this wisdom, that he had to
   be taught again like a new beginner in the very midst of his course.
   Yea, although he had now been long accustomed to mourn over his sins,
   he was every day anew reduced to this exercise, which teaches us, how
   long it is ere men recover themselves when once they have fallen; and
   also how slow they are to obey until God, from time to time, redouble
   their stripes, and increase them from day to day. Should any one ask
   concerning David, whether he had become callous under the stripes which
   he well knew were inflicted on him by the hand of God, the context
   furnishes the answer; namely, that he was kept down and fettered by
   perplexing griefs, and distracted with lingering torments, until he was
   well subdued and made meek, which is the first sign of seeking a
   remedy. And this again teaches us, that it is not without cause that
   the chastisements by which God seems to deal cruelly with us are
   repeated, and his hand made heavy against us, until our fierce pride,
   which we know to be un-tameable, unless subdued with the heaviest
   stripes, is humbled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [661] The translation of this verse in our English Bible is, "When I
   kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long;"
   on which Street observes, "I must own I do not understand how a man can
   be said to keep silence who roars all the day long." Accordingly,
   instead of When I kept silence, he reads, While I am lost in thought;
   observing that, the verb chrs, in the Hiphil conjugation, signifies to
   ponder, to consider, to be deep in thought." But according to the
   translation and exposition of Calvin, there is no inconsistency between
   the first and the second clause of the verse. To avoid the apparent
   contradiction of being at once silent and yet roaring all the day long,
   Dr Boothroyd, instead of roaring, reads pangs.

   Psalm 32:5-7

   5. I have acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
   hid. I said, I will confess against myself to Jehovah my wickedness;
   and thou didst remit the guilt [662] of my sin. Selah. 6. Therefore
   shall every one that is meek pray unto thee in the time of finding
   thee; so that in a flood of many waters, [663] they shall not come nigh
   unto him. 7. Thou art my hiding-place; thou shalt preserve me from
   trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.


   5. I have acknowledged my sin unto thee. The prophet now describes the
   issue of his misery, in order to show to all the ready way of obtaining
   the happiness of which he makes mention. When his feeling of divine
   wrath sorely vexed and tormented him, his only relief was unfeignedly
   to condemn himself before God, and humbly to flee to him to crave his
   forgiveness. He does not say, however, that his sins merely came to his
   remembrance, for so also did the sins of Cain and Judas, although to no
   profit; because, when the consciences of the wicked are troubled with
   their sins, they cease not to torment themselves, and to fret against
   God: yea, although he forces them unwillingly to his bar, they still
   eagerly desire to hide themselves. But here there is described a very
   different method of acknowledging sin; namely, when the sinner
   willingly betakes himself to God, building his hope of salvation not on
   stubbornness or hypocrisy, but on supplication for pardon. This
   voluntary confession is always conjoined with faith; for otherwise the
   sinner will continually seek lurking-places where he may hide himself
   from God. David's words clearly show that he came unfeignedly and
   cordially into the presence of God, that he might conceal nothing. When
   he tells us that he acknowledged his sin, and did not hide it, the
   latter clause is added, according to the Hebrew idiom, for the sake of
   amplification. There is no doubt, therefore, that David, when he
   appeared before God, poured out all his heart. Hypocrites, we know,
   that they may extenuate their evil doings, either disguise or
   misrepresent them; in short, they never make an honest confession of
   them, with an ingenuous and open mouth. But David denies that he was
   chargeable with this baseness. Without any dissimulation he made known
   to God whatever grieved him; and this he confirms by the words, I have
   said While the wicked are dragged by force, just as a judge compels
   offenders to come to trial, he assures us that he came deliberately and
   with full purpose of mind; for the term, said, just signifies that he
   deliberated with himself. It therefore follows, that he promised and
   assured himself of pardon through the mercy of God, in order that
   terror might not prevent him from making a free and an ingenuous
   confession of his sins.

   The phrase, upon myself, or against myself, intimates that David put
   away from him all the excuses and pretences by which men are accustomed
   to unburden themselves, transferring their fault, or tracing it to
   other people. David, therefore, determined to submit himself entirely
   to God's judgment, and to make known his own guilt, that being
   self-condemned, he might as a suppliant obtain pardon.

   And thou didst remit the guilt of my sin. This clause is set in
   opposition to the grievous and direful agitations by which he says he
   was harassed before he approached by faith the grace of God. But the
   words also teach, that as often as the sinner presents himself at the
   throne of mercy, with ingenuous confession, he will find reconciliation
   with God awaiting him. In other words, the Psalmist means that God was
   not only willing to pardon him, but that his example afforded a general
   lesson that those in distress should not doubt of God's favor towards
   them, so soon as they should betake themselves to him with a sincere
   and willing mind. Should any one infer from this, that repentance and
   confession are the cause of obtaining grace, the answer is easy;
   namely, that David is not speaking here of the cause but of the manner
   in which the sinner becomes reconciled to God. Confession, no doubt,
   intervenes, but we must go beyond this, and consider that it is faith
   which, by opening our hearts and tongues, really obtains our pardon. It
   is not admitted that every thing which is necessarily connected with
   pardon is to be reckoned amongst its causes. Or, to speak more simply,
   David obtained pardon by his confession, not because he merited it by
   the mere act of confessing, but because, under the guidance of faith,
   he humbly implored it from his judge. Moreover, as the same method of
   confession ought to be in use among us at this day, which was formerly
   employed by the fathers under the law, this sufficiently refutes that
   tyrannical decree of the Pope, by which he turns us away from God, and
   sends us to his priests to obtain pardon.

   6. Therefore shall every one that is meek pray unto thee. Here the
   Psalmist expressly states that whatever he has hitherto set forth in
   his own person belongs in common to all the children of God. And this
   is to be carefully observed, because, from our native unbelief, the
   greater part of us are slow and reluctant to appropriate the grace of
   God. We may also learn from this, that David obtained forgiveness, not
   by the mere act of confession, as some speak, but by faith and prayer.
   Here he directs believers to the same means of obtaining it, bidding
   them betake themselves to prayer, which is the true sacrifice of faith.
   Farther, we are taught, that in David God gave an example of his mercy,
   which may not only extend to us all, but may also show us how
   reconciliation is to be sought. The words, every one, serve for the
   confirmation of every godly person; but the Psalmist at the same time
   shows, that no one can obtain the hope of salvation but by prostrating
   himself as a suppliant before God, because all without exception stand
   in need of his mercy.

   The expression, The time of finding, which immediately follows, some
   think, refers to the ordinary and accustomed hours of prayer; but
   others more accurately, in my opinion, compare it [664] with that place
   in Isaiah, (Isaiah 55:6,) where it is said, "Seek ye the Lord while he
   may be found, call ye upon him while he is near." It is never out of
   season, indeed, to seek God, for every moment we need his grace, and he
   is always willing to meet us. But as slothfulness or dullness hinders
   us from seeking him, David here particularly intimates the critical
   seasons when believers are stimulated by a sense of their own need to
   have recourse to God. The Papists have abused this place to warrant
   their doctrine, that we ought to have advocates in heaven to pray for
   us; [665] but the attempt to found an argument in support of such a
   doctrine from this passage is so grossly absurd that it is unworthy of
   refutation. We may see from it, however, either how wickedly they have
   corrupted the whole Scripture, or with what gross ignorance they
   blunder in the plainest matters.

   In the flood of many waters. This expression agrees with that prophecy
   of Joel,

   "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be delivered."
   (Joel 2:32)

   The meaning is, that although the deep whirlpools of death may compass
   us round on every side, we ought not to fear that they shall swallow us
   up; but rather believe that we shall be safe and unhurt, if we only
   betake ourselves to the mercy of God. We are thus emphatically taught
   that the godly shall have certain salvation even in death, provided
   they betake themselves to the sanctuary of God's grace. Under the term
   flood are denoted all those dangers from which there appears no means
   of escape.

   At last the Psalmist gives himself to thanksgiving, and although he
   uses but few words to celebrate the divine favor, there is,
   notwithstanding, much force in his brevity. In the first place, he
   denies that there is any other haven of safety but in God himself.
   Secondly, he assures himself that God will be his faithful keeper
   hereafter; for I willingly retain the future tense of the verb, though
   some, without any reason, translate it into the past. He is not,
   however, to be understood as meaning that he conceived himself safe
   from future tribulations, but he sets God's guardianship over against
   them. Lastly, whatever adversity may befall him, he is persuaded that
   God will be his deliverer. By the word compass, he means manifold and
   various kinds of deliverance; as if he had said, that he should be
   under obligation to God in innumerable ways, and that he should, on
   every side, have most abundant matter for praising him. We may observe
   in the meantime, how he offers his service of gratitude to God,
   according to his usual method, putting songs of deliverance instead of
   help.

   Psalm 32:8-11

   8. I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way that thou mayest
   walk: I will counsel thee with mine eye. [666] 9. Be not like the horse
   or mule, which have no understanding: thou shalt bind his jaw with bit
   and bridle, lest they kick against [or become obstreperous against or
   obstinately disobey] thee. [667] 10. Many sorrows shall be to the
   wicked: but the man who hopeth in Jehovah, mercy shall surround him.
   11. Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous: sing all ye that are
   upright in heart.


   8. I will instruct thee, and teach thee. That his exhortation may have
   the greater force, the divine speaker directs his discourse to every
   man individually; for the doctrine which is spoken penetrates the mind
   more readily, when every man applies it particularly to himself. When
   the way of salvation is here shown to the children of God, the greatest
   care must be taken that no man depart from it in the slightest degree.
   We may also learn from this place, that we are reconciled to God upon
   condition that every man endeavor to make his brethren partakers of the
   same benefit. David, the more strongly to mark his care about them,
   describes it by the sight of the eye. [668] By the way it should be
   observed, that those who are solicitous about our welfare are appointed
   by the Lord as guides of our way, from which it appears how great is
   the paternal solicitude which he has about us.

   9. Be not like the horse or mule. David now briefly explains the amount
   of the counsel which he formerly said he would give. He exhorts all to
   learn with quietness, to lay aside stubbornness, and to put on the
   spirit of meekness. There is much wisdom, too, in the advice which he
   gives to the godly to correct their hardihood; for if we were as
   attentive to God's corrections as we ought, every one would eagerly
   hasten to seek his favor. Whence is so much slowness to be found in
   all, but that we are either stupid or refractory? By likening the
   refractory, therefore, to brute beasts, David puts them to shame, and
   at the same time declares that it will avail them nothing to "kick
   against the pricks." Men, says he, know how to tame the fierceness of
   horses by bridles and bits; what then do they think God will do when he
   finds them intractable?

   10. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked. Without a figure he here
   declares what will be the condition of the rebellious and stiff-necked.
   [669] He mentioned before that God wanted not bridles and bits with
   which to restrain their frowardness; and now he adds, that there would
   be no end or measure of their miseries until they were utterly
   consumed. Although God, therefore, may spare us for a time, yet let
   this denunciation fill us with fear, and preserve us from hardening
   ourselves, because we are as yet unpunished; nor let our prosperity,
   which is cursed by God, so deceive us as to close our minds against
   reflecting on those unseen sorrows which he threatens against all the
   wicked. And as the Psalmist has told us, on the one hand, that God is
   armed with innumerable plagues against the wicked, so he adds, on the
   other hand, that he is furnished with infinite goodness, with which he
   can succor all who are his. The sum is, that there is no other remedy
   for our afflictions but to humble ourselves under God's hand, and to
   found our salvation on his mercy alone; and that those who rely on God
   shall be blessed in all respects, because, on whatever side Satan may
   assault them, there will the Lord oppose him, and shield them with his
   protecting power.

   11. Be glad in Jehovah. After teaching how ready and accessible true
   happiness is to all the godly, David, with much reason, exhorts them to
   gladness. He commands them to rejoice in the Lord, as if he had said,
   There is nothing to prevent them from assuring themselves of God's
   favor, seeing he so liberally and so kindly offers to be reconciled to
   them. In the meantime, we may observe that this is the incomparable
   fruit of faith which Paul likewise commends, namely, when the
   consciences of the godly being quiet and cheerful, enjoy peace and
   spiritual joy. Wherever faith is lively, this holy rejoicing will
   follow. But since the world's own impiety prevents it from
   participating in this joy, David, therefore, addresses the righteous
   alone, whom he denominates the upright in heart, to teach us that the
   external appearance of righteousness which pleases men is of no avail
   in the sight of God. But how does he call those righteous, whose whole
   happiness consists in the free mercy of God not imputing their sins to
   them? I answer, that none others are received into favor but those who
   are dissatisfied with themselves for their sins, and repent with their
   whole heart; not that this repentance merits pardon, but because faith
   can never be separated from the spirit of regeneration. When they have
   begun to devote themselves to God, he accepts the upright disposition
   of their hearts equally as if it were pure and perfect; for faith not
   only reconciles a man to God, but also sanctifies whatever is imperfect
   in him, so that by the free grace of God, he becomes righteous who
   could never have obtained so great a blessing by any merit of his own.

   [666] "Ou, je guideray de mon oeil." -- Fr. marg. "Or, I will guide
   thee with mine eye."

   [667] This verse in the Hebrew is very elliptical and obscure. Hence,
   besides the translation of Calvin, which agrees very well with the
   scope of the passage, various other translations have been given of it.
   In our English Bible, the last clause is rendered, "lest they come near
   unto thee," that is, to attack thee. But this is evidently an incorrect
   translation. This is not the common practice of these animals, which
   are timid, and not ferocious; bits and bridles are not used for the
   purpose of keeping them away from us, but of subduing, guiding, and
   making them subservient to our will; and were this the sense, the
   figure would be inappropriate, since the object of the Psalmist is to
   induce men to approach God. The clause, therefore, is rendered by many
   critics, "Or they will not come nigh unto thee;" that is, they will
   flee from thee. The Hebrew for this last phrase is, "There is not a
   coming to thee."

   [668] Most commentators consider Jehovah as the person speaking in this
   verse. Calvin, however, views David as the speaker. In this opinion he
   is followed by Walford. "In Psalm 51:13," says this critic, "written
   about the same time and on the same occasion, David urges as a reason
   why God should restore to him the joy of his salvation, that he might
   be enabled to teach transgressors his ways, and that sinners might be
   converted to him. So in the passage before us, he addresses himself to
   sinners, and says, I will instruct time, and teach thee the way in
   which thou shalt go.'"

   [669] Fry reads, "Many are the wounds of the refractory;" on which he
   has the following note:- "We perceive in this place the exact idea of
   vsts, in its allusion to the restive, disobedient, unyielding,
   ungovernable mule or horse. It is opposed to vtch, to confide in, to
   yield to, or succumb, as the gentle beast fully confides and yields
   himself to the management of his guide."

   PSALM 33.

   David, or whoever was the author of this psalm, in order to excite
   believers to praise God, founds his argument upon the general
   providence of God, by which he sustains, protects, and governs the
   whole world. Afterwards he celebrates God's paternal kindness towards
   his chosen people, showing at the same time how necessary it is that
   the godly should be cherished by his special care.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 33:1-4

   1. Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous; praise is comely [670] for the
   upright. 2. Praise Jehovah upon the harp; sing unto him upon the viol,
   and an instrument of ten strings. 3. Sing a new song to him; sing
   loudly with joyfulness: 4. For the word of Jehovah is right; and all
   his works are in faithfulness. [671]


   1. Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous. Here the inspired writer addresses
   believers or the righteous by name, because they alone are capable of
   proclaiming the glory of God. Unbelievers, who have never tasted his
   goodness, cannot praise him from the heart, and God has no pleasure in
   his name being pronounced by their unholy tongues. But the context
   shows more distinctly why this exhortation is suitable for believers
   only. Many, accordingly, expound the latter clause, Praise is comely
   for the upright, as meaning, that if the ungodly or hypocrites attempt
   this exercise, it will turn to the reproach and dishonor of God rather
   than to his praise; nay, more, that they only profane his holy name. It
   is, no doubt, very true, as I have already remarked, that God creates
   for himself a church in the world by gracious adoption, for the express
   purpose, that his name may be duly praised by witnesses suitable for
   such a work. But the real meaning of the clause, Praise is comely for
   the upright, is, that there is no exercise in which they can be better
   employed. And, assuredly, since God by his daily benefits furnishes
   them with such matter for celebrating his glory, and since his
   boundless goodness, as we have elsewhere seen, is laid up as a peculiar
   treasure for them, it were disgraceful and utterly unreasonable for
   them to be silent in the praises of God. The amount of the matter is,
   that the principal exercise in which it becomes the righteous to be
   employed is to publish among men the righteousness, goodness, and power
   of God, the knowledge of which is implanted in their minds. Following
   other interpreters, I have translated the clause, Praise is comely, but
   the word rendered comely may also be properly rendered desirable, if we
   view it as derived from the Hebrew word 'vh, avah, which signifies to
   wish or desire. And certainly, when God allures believers so sweetly,
   it is proper that they employ themselves in celebrating his praises
   with their whole hearts. It is also to be observed, that when the
   prophet, after having in the first clause used the appellation, the
   righteous, immediately adds the words, the upright, which comprehend
   the inward integrity of the heart, he defines what true righteousness
   is, or in what it consists.

   2. Praise Jehovah upon the harp. It is evident that the Psalmist here
   expresses the vehement and ardent affection which the faithful ought to
   have in praising God, when he enjoins musical instruments to be
   employed for this purpose. He would have nothing omitted by believers
   which tends to animate the minds and feelings of men in singing God's
   praises. The name of God, no doubt, can, properly speaking, be
   celebrated only by the articulate voice; but it is not without reason
   that David adds to this those aids by which believers were wont to
   stimulate themselves the more to this exercise; especially considering
   that he was speaking to God's ancient people. There is a distinction,
   however, to be observed here, that we may not indiscriminately consider
   as applicable to ourselves, every thing which was formerly enjoined
   upon the Jews. I have no doubt that playing upon cymbals, touching the
   harp and the viol, and all that kind of music, which is so frequently
   mentioned in the Psalms, was a part of the education; that is to say,
   the puerile instruction of the law: I speak of the stated service of
   the temple. For even now, if believers choose to cheer themselves with
   musical instruments, they should, I think, make it their object not to
   dissever their cheerfulness from the praises of God. But when they
   frequent their sacred assemblies, musical instruments in celebrating
   the praises of God would be no more suitable than the burning of
   incense, the lighting up of lamps, and the restoration of the other
   shadows of the law. The Papists, therefore, have foolishly borrowed
   this, as well as many other things, from the Jews. Men who are fond of
   outward pomp may delight in that noise; but the simplicity which God
   recommends to us by the apostle is far more pleasing to him. Paul
   allows us to bless God in the public assembly of the saints only in a
   known tongue, (1 Corinthians 14:16.) The voice of man, although not
   understood by the generality, assuredly excels all inanimate
   instruments of music; and yet we see what St Paul determines concerning
   speaking in an unknown tongue. [672] What shall we then say of
   chanting, which fills the ears with nothing but an empty sound? Does
   any one object, that music is very useful for awakening the minds of
   men and moving their hearts? I own it; but we should always take care
   that no corruption creep in, which might both defile the pure worship
   of God and involve men in superstition. Moreover, since the Holy Spirit
   expressly warns us of this danger by the mouth of Paul, to proceed
   beyond what we are there warranted by him is not only, I must say,
   unadvised zeal, but wicked and perverse obstinacy.

   3. Sing unto him a new song. As the Psalmist afterwards treats of the
   mighty works of God, and particularly concerning the preservation of
   the Church, it is not wonderful that he exhorts the righteous to sing a
   new, that is, a rare and choice song. The more closely and diligently
   that believers consider the works of God, the more will they exert
   themselves in his praises. It is no common song, therefore, which he
   exhorts them to sing, but a song corresponding to the magnificence of
   the subject. This is also the meaning of the second clause, in which he
   urges them to sing loudly. In this sense, I understand the Hebrew word
   hytyv, heytib, although others refer it rather to the proper setting of
   the notes.

   4. For the word of Jehovah is right. As I have just remarked, the
   Psalmist first sets forth God's general providence by which he governs
   the whole world; and he tells us that he so exerts his power in the
   whole course of his operations, that the most perfect equity and
   faithfulness shine forth everywhere. Some will have the terms word and
   work to be synonymous; but I think there is a distinction, and that
   word means the same thing as counsel or ordinance, while work signifies
   the effect or execution of his counsel. I grant that here the same
   subject is repeated in different words, as is the case in other places;
   but a slight variation will be found in such repetitions, that the same
   thing may he expressed in various ways. The amount of what is stated
   is, that whatever God appoints and commands is right; and whatever he
   brings to pass in actual operation is faithful and true. Meanwhile, it
   ought to be observed, that the term word is not to be understood of
   doctrine, but of the method by which God governs the world.

   Psalm 33:5-9

   5. He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
   goodness of Jehovah. 6. By the word of Jehovah were the heavens
   established; and all the host of them by the spirit [673] of his mouth.
   7. He gathered together the waters of the sea as into a heap; He hath
   laid up the deeps in treasures. 8. Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let
   the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him: 9. For he spake, and
   it was; he commanded, and it stood.


   5. He loveth righteousness and judgment. This is a confirmation of the
   preceding verse, and intimates to us that God of his own nature loves
   righteousness and equity. It therefore follows, that froward affections
   cannot hurry him, after the manner of men, to evil devices. At first
   sight, indeed, this appears but a common commendation of God, and of
   small importance, because all confess that he observes the most perfect
   rule of righteousness in all his works. Why then, may some one say, has
   a new song just been spoken of, as if it had been about some unusual
   matter? We answer, in the first place, because it is too obvious how
   wickedly a great part of the world shut their eyes to God's
   righteousness, while they either carelessly overlook innumerable proofs
   of his providence, or imagine that they happen by chance. But there is
   often a worse fault than this; namely, that if our wishes are not
   gratified, we instantly murmur against God's righteousness; and
   although the maxim, "God doeth all things righteously," is in every
   man's mouth, yet scarcely one in a hundred firmly believes it in his
   heart, otherwise, as soon as this truth is pronounced, "Thus it
   pleaseth God," every man would obediently submit himself to God's will.
   Now, as men in adversity are with the utmost difficulty brought to this
   point - to acknowledge that God is just, and as, in prosperity, they
   soon fall from the acknowledgement of it, it is not to be wondered at
   that the prophet, in order to persuade men that God is an upright
   governor, affirms that he loveth righteousness. Whoever, therefore, has
   thoroughly embraced this doctrine, let him know that he has profited
   much.

   Others explain this to mean, that God loveth righteousness in men.
   This, indeed, is true; but it is far from the sense of the text,
   because the design of the Holy Spirit here is to maintain the glory of
   God in opposition to the poison of ungodliness, which is deeply seated
   in many hearts. In the second clause of the verse, the Psalmist
   commends another part of God's excellence, namely, that the earth is
   full of his goodness The righteousness of God ought justly to incite us
   to praise him, but his goodness is a more powerful motive; because, the
   more experience which any man has of his beneficence and mercy, the
   more strongly is he influenced to worship him. Farther, the discourse
   is still concerning all the benefits of God which he scatters over the
   whole human race. These, the inspired writer declares, meet us wherever
   we turn our eyes.

   6. By the word of Jehovah. That he may stir us up to think more closely
   of God's works, he brings before us the creation of the world itself;
   for until God be acknowledged as the Creator and Framer of the world,
   who will believe that he attends to the affairs of men, and that the
   state of the world is controlled by his wisdom and power? But the
   creation of the world leads us by direct consequence to the providence
   of God. Not that all men reason so justly, or are endued with so sound
   a judgment, as to conclude that the world is at this day maintained by
   the same divine power which was once put forth in creating it: on the
   contrary, the great majority imagine that he is an idle spectator in
   heaven of whatever is transacted on earth. But no man truly believes
   that the world was created by God unless he is also firmly persuaded
   that it is maintained and preserved by him. Wisely and properly,
   therefore, does the prophet carry us back to the very origin of the
   world, in order to fix in our minds the certainty of God's providence
   in the continual order of nature. By the figure synecdoche, he uses the
   term heavens for the whole fabric of the world, because, as I have
   elsewhere remarked, the sight of the heavens more than all the other
   parts of creation transports us with admiration. He therefore
   immediately adds, And all the host of them, by which phraseology,
   according to the usual method of Scripture, he means the stars and
   planets; for if the heavens were destitute of this ornament, they would
   in a manner be empty. In saying that the heavens were created by the
   word of God, he greatly magnifies his power, because by his nod alone,
   [674] without any other aid or means, and without much time or labor,
   [675] he created so noble and magnificent a work. But although the
   Psalmist sets the word of God and the breath of his mouth in opposition
   both to all external means, and to every idea of painful labor on God's
   part, yet we may truly and certainly infer from this passage, that the
   world was framed by God's Eternal Word, his only begotten Son. Ancient
   interpreters have, with considerable ingenuity, employed this passage
   as a proof of the eternal Deity of the Holy Spirit against the
   Sabellians. But it appears from other places, particularly from Isaiah
   11:4, that by the breath of the mouth is meant nothing else but speech.
   For it is there said concerning Christ, "He shall smite the earth with
   the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the
   wicked." As powerful and effective speech is there allegorically
   denominated the rod of his mouth; so in like manner, for another
   purpose it is denominated in the immediately succeeding clause the
   breath of his mouth, to mark the difference that exists between God's
   speech and the empty sounds which proceed from the mouths of men. In
   proving the Divinity of the Holy Spirit, therefore, I durst not press
   this text against Sabellius. Let us account it sufficient that God has
   formed the heavens by his Word in such a manner as to prove the eternal
   Deity of Christ. Should any object that these divine persons would not
   appear distinct if the terms Word and Breath are synonymous; I answer,
   that the term breath is not employed here simply as in other places, in
   which there is evidently a distinction made between the Word and the
   Spirit; but the breath of his mouth is used figuratively for the very
   utterance of speech; as if it had been said, As soon as God uttered the
   breath of his mouth, or proclaimed in word what he wished to be done,
   the heavens were instantly brought into existence, and were furnished,
   too, with an inconceivable number and variety of stars. It is indeed
   true that this similitude is borrowed from men; but the Scriptures
   often teach in other places, that the world was created by that Eternal
   Word, who, being the only begotten Son of God, appeared afterwards in
   flesh.

   7. He gathered together the waters of the sea as into a heap. [676]
   Here the Psalmist does not speak of all that might have been said of
   every part of the world, but under one department he comprehends all
   the rest. He celebrates, however, a signal and remarkable miracle which
   we see in looking on the surface of the earth; namely, that God gathers
   together the element of water, fluid and unstable as it is, into a
   solid heap, and holds it so at his pleasure. Natural philosophers
   confess, and experience openly proclaims, that the waters occupy a
   higher place than the earth. How is it then that, as they are fluid and
   naturally disposed to flow, they do not spread abroad and cover the
   earth, and how is it that the earth, which is lower in position,
   remains dry? In this we certainly perceive that God, who is ever
   attentive to the welfare of the human race, has inclosed the waters
   within certain invisible barriers, and keeps them shut up to this day;
   and the prophet elegantly declares that they stand still at God's
   commandment, as if they were a heap of firm and solid matter. Nor is it
   without design that the Holy Spirit, in various passages, adduces this
   proof of divine power, as in Jeremiah 5:22, and Job 38:8

   In the second part of the verse, he seems to repeat the same idea, but
   with amplification. God not only confines the immense mass of waters in
   the seas, but also hides them, by a mysterious and incomprehensible
   power, in the very bowels of the earth. Whoever will compare the
   elements among themselves, will reckon it contrary to nature that the
   bottomless depths, or the immeasurable gulfs of waters, whose native
   tendency is rather to overwhelm the earth, should lie hid under it.
   That so many hollow channels and gulfs, accordingly, should not swallow
   up the earth every moment, affords another magnificent display of
   divine power; for although now and then some cities and fields are
   engulfed, yet the body of the earth is preserved in its place.

   8. Let all the earth fear Jehovah. The Psalmist concludes that there is
   just reason why the whole world should reverently submit itself to the
   government of God, who gave it being, and who also preserves it. To
   fear Jehovah, and to stand in awe of him, just means to do honor to,
   and to reverence his mighty power. It is a mark of great insensibility
   not to bow at God's presence, from whom we have our being, and upon
   whom our condition depends. The prophet alludes to both these things,
   affirming that the world appeared as soon as God spake, and that it is
   upheld in being by his commandment; for it would not have been enough
   for the world to have been created in a moment, if it had not been
   supported in existence by the power of God. He did not employ a great
   array of means in creating the world, but to prove the inconceivable
   power of his word, he ordered that so soon as he should as it were
   pronounce the word, the thing should be done. [677] The word command,
   therefore, confirms what I formerly said, that his speech was nothing
   else than a nod, or wish, and that to speak implies the same thing as
   to command. It is proper, however, to understand that in this nod, or
   command, the eternal wisdom of God displayed itself.

   Psalm 33:10-12

   10. Jehovah scattereth the counsel of the nations, and bringeth to
   nought the imaginations of the people. [678] 11. The counsel of Jehovah
   shall stand for ever, and the thoughts of his heart from age to age.
   [679] 12. Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah, the people whom
   he hath chosen for his inheritance.


   10. Jehovah scattereth the counsel of the nations. After briefly
   touching upon the creation of the world, the Psalmist returns to his
   former subject, namely, to show that the events which daily come to
   pass are undoubted proofs of the providence of God. And lest any man
   should be surprised, that he should exhibit God as an adversary to men,
   scattering their counsels rather than establishing and bringing them to
   a happy issue, he selects an instance which had the greatest power to
   comfort the saints. We know how many things men continually venture
   upon and contrive against all law and justice, and how they endeavor by
   their devices to turn the world upside down, that they may tyrannically
   acquire power to trample upon the good and simple. What creatures then
   would be more miserable than we, if men, possessed of such a variety of
   wicked affections, were permitted to act with unlicensed wantonness
   towards us? But when God declares from heaven to us, that it is his
   work to dash in pieces their devices, and to bring their determinations
   to nought, there is no reason why we should not keep ourselves quiet,
   even when they bestir themselves most tumultuously. God is, therefore,
   said to overthrow the counsels of men, not because he professedly
   delights in frustrating them, but to check their wantonness; for they
   would immediately throw all things into confusion were they to succeed
   according to their wishes: yea, as in outraging equity, and vexing the
   upright and innocent, they fail not to fight against God himself, it is
   very necessary to consider that God's power and protection is set in
   opposition to their fury. And as the great majority of men, despising
   all modesty, rush headlong into indiscriminate licentiousness, the
   prophet speaks not only of individual men, but of whole nations; in
   other words, he affirms, that however men may conspire among
   themselves, and determine to attempt this or that with great hosts, yet
   shall their purposes be brought to nought, because it is as easy for
   God to scatter multitudes as to restrain a few. But although it is
   God's design in this place to fortify us with good hope against the
   boldness of the wicked, he warns us, at the same time, to undertake
   nothing without his command and guidance.

   11. The counsel of Jehovah. The prophet extols the infinite power of
   God in such a manner as that he may build up our faith in its
   greatness; for he does not here commend a counsel of God which is
   hidden in heaven, and which he would have us to honor and revere at a
   distance. But as the Lord everywhere in Scripture testifies that he
   loveth righteousness and truth; that he cares for the righteous and
   good; and that he is ever inclined to succor his servants when they are
   wrongfully oppressed; -- the prophet means, that all this shall remain
   sure and steadfast. Thus he declares for what end God bringeth to
   nought the counsels of the nations, namely, because without
   discrimination they run headlong into the violation of all order.

   In the first place, then, let us learn to look at God's counsel in the
   glass of his word; and when we have satisfied ourselves that he has
   promised nothing but what he has determined to perform, let us
   immediately call to mind the steadfastness of which the prophet here
   speaks. And as many, or rather whole, nations sometimes endeavor to
   impede its course by innumerable hinderances, let us also remember the
   preceding declaration, that when men have imagined many devices, it is
   in God's power, and often his pleasure, to bring them to nought. The
   Holy Spirit unquestionably intended to have our faith exercised in this
   practical knowledge; otherwise what he here says of the counsel of God
   would be but cold and fruitless. But when we shall have once persuaded
   ourselves of this, that God will defend his servants who call upon his
   name, and rid them of all dangers; whatever mischief the wicked may
   practice against them, their endeavors and attempts shall in nowise
   terrify us, because, so soon as God sets himself in opposition to their
   machinations, no craft on their part will be able to defeat his
   counsel.

   12. Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah. This verse excellently
   agrees with the preceding, because it would profit us little to observe
   what is said of the stability of God's counsel if that counsel referred
   not to us. The prophet, therefore, in proclaiming that they are blessed
   whom God receives into his protection, reminds us that the counsel
   which he had just mentioned is not a secret which remains always hidden
   in God, but is displayed in the existence and protection of the Church,
   and may there be beheld. Thus we see, that it is not those who coldly
   speculate about the power of God, but those alone who apply it to their
   own present benefit, who rightly acknowledge God as the Governor of the
   world. Moreover, when the Psalmist places all our blessedness in this,
   that Jehovah is our God, in touching upon the fountain of divine love
   towards us, he comprehends, in one word, whatever is wont to be desired
   to make life happy. For when God condescends to undertake the care of
   our salvation, to cherish us under his wings, to provide for our
   necessities, to aid us in all our dangers, all this depends on our
   adoption by him. But lest it should be thought that men obtain so great
   a good by their own efforts and industry, David teaches us expressly
   that it proceeds from the fountain of God's gracious electing love that
   we are accounted the people of God. It is indeed true, that, in the
   person of Adam, men were created at first for the very purpose that
   they should be the sons of God; but the estrangement which followed
   upon sin deprived us of that great blessing. Until God, therefore,
   freely adopt us, we are all by nature wretched, and we have no other
   entrance to or means of attaining happiness but this, that God, of his
   own good pleasure, should choose us who are altogether unworthy. It
   appears, accordingly, how foolishly they corrupt this passage, who
   transfer to men what the prophet here ascribes to God, as if men would
   choose God for their inheritance. I own, indeed, that it is by faith
   that we distinguish the true God from idols; but this principle is
   always to be held fast, that we have no interest in him at all unless
   he prevent us by his grace.

   Psalm 33:13-17

   13. Jehovah looked down from heaven; he beheld the children of Adam.
   14. From the dwelling-place of his throne he looked on all the
   inhabitants of the earth. 15. He who fashioned their hearts altogether,
   [680] who understandeth all their works. 16. A king is not saved for
   the multitude of his host, nor a giant delivered for the greatness of
   his strength. 17. A horse is a deceitful thing for safety, [681] and
   will not deliver by the greatness of his strength.


   13. Jehovah looked down from heaven. The Psalmist still proceeds with
   the same doctrine, namely, that human affairs are not tossed hither and
   thither fortuitously, but that God secretly guides and directs all that
   we see taking place. Now he here commends God's inspection of all
   things, that we on our part may learn to behold, and to contemplate
   with the eye of faith, his invisible providence. There are, no doubt,
   evident proofs of it continually before our eyes; but the great
   majority of men, notwithstanding, see nothing of them, and, in their
   blindness, imagine that all things are under the conduct of a blind
   fortune. Nay, the more plenteously and abundantly that he sheds his
   goodness upon us, the less do we raise our thoughts to him, but
   preposterously settle them down immovably on the external circumstances
   which surround us. The prophet here rebukes this base conduct, because
   no greater affront can be offered to God than to shut him up in heaven
   in a state of idleness. This is the same as if he were to lie buried in
   a grave. What kind of life would God's life be, if he neither saw nor
   took care of any thing? Under the term throne, too, the sacred writer
   shows, from what is implied in it, what an absurd infatuation it is to
   divest God of thought and understanding. He gives us to understand by
   this word, that heaven is not a palace in which God remains idle and
   indulges in pleasures, as the Epicureans dream, but a royal court, from
   which he exercises his government over all parts of the world. If he
   has erected his throne, therefore, in the sanctuary of heaven, in order
   to govern the universe, it follows that he in no wise neglects the
   affairs of earth, but governs them with the highest reason and wisdom.

   15. He who fashioned their hearts altogether. It appears that this is
   added for the express purpose of assuredly persuading believers, that,
   however the wicked might craftily, deceitfully, and by secret
   stratagems, attempt to withdraw themselves from God's sight, and hide
   themselves in caverns, yet his eyes would penetrate into their dark
   hiding-places. And the Psalmist argues from the very creation that God
   cannot but bring men's devices and doings into reckoning and judgment;
   because, though each man has intricate recesses concealed in his bosom,
   so that there is a wonderful diversity of different minds in this
   respect, and this great variety creates a most confounding obscurity;
   yet the eyes of God cannot be dazzled and darkened, so that he may not
   be a competent judge and take cognisance of his own work. By the adverb
   together, therefore, he does not mean that the hearts of men were
   formed at the same moment of time; but that all of them were fashioned
   even to one, and without a single exception; so that those manifest
   great folly who attempt to hide, or to withdraw the knowledge of their
   hearts from him who framed them. The discourse may also be understood
   as meaning, that men cannot, by the erring devices of their own
   thoughts, diminish the authority of God over them, so that he may not
   govern by his secret providence the events which seem to them to happen
   by chance. We see, indeed, he in forming their vain hopes, they despoil
   God of his power, and transfer it to the creatures, at one time to this
   object, and at another time to that, conceiving that they have no need
   of his aid, so long as they are furnished with outward means and helps
   to protect themselves.

   It therefore follows, A king is not saved for the multitude of his
   host, etc By this the inspired writer means to teach us, that the
   safety of men's lives depends not upon their own strength, but upon the
   favor of God. He names particularly kings and giants rather than
   others; because, as they are not of the common class of men, but of a
   higher condition, they appear to themselves to be beyond the reach of
   all danger from darts, and if any adversity befall them, they promise
   themselves an easy deliverance from it. In short, intoxicated with a
   presumptuous confidence of their own strength, they scarcely think
   themselves mortal. They are still more hardened in this pride by the
   foolish admiration of the common people, who stand amazed at the
   greatness of their power. If, therefore, neither a king is saved by his
   troops, nor a giant by his strength, when they are exposed to danger,
   in vain do mankind neglect the providence of God, and look around them
   for human help. From this it follows, that the condition, both of the
   strong and the weak, is miserable, until they learn to rely on the
   protection of God.

   17. A horse is a deceitful thing for safety. In this verse, the
   Psalmist, by the figure synecdoche under the name of horse, is to be
   understood as meaning any kind of help. The sense is, that in general
   those who conceive that their life is well protected by earthly means,
   are commonly disappointed at the very crisis of danger, and are
   miserably beguiled to their utter undoing, so that God therein clearly
   shows them their folly. It is true, that kings are not armed with the
   sword in vain, nor is the use of horses superfluous, nor are the
   treasures and resources which God furnishes to defend men's lives
   unnecessary, provided a right method of employing them be observed. But
   as the greater part of men the more they are surrounded with human
   defences, withdraw themselves the farther from God, and by a false
   imagination persuade themselves that they are in a haven safe from all
   disturbance, God acts most justly in disappointing this madness. This
   is the reason why his gifts often pass away without effect, because the
   world, by separating them from the giver, is also justly deprived of
   his blessing.

   Psalm 33:18-19

   18. Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, upon those
   who hope in his mercy; 19. To deliver their souls from death, and to
   give them life in the time of famine.


   18. Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him. Having shown
   that what men account their best defences often profit them nothing, or
   rather are utterly worthless, when men depend upon them; the Psalmist
   now shows, on the other hand, that believers, although they are neither
   men of great power nor of great wealth, are nevertheless sufficiently
   protected by God's favor alone, and shall be safe for ever. His meaning
   is not a little illustrated by this comparison, that kings and giants
   derive no aid from their invincible strength, while God supports the
   life of the saints in famine and dearth, as really as if he were to
   restore life to them when dead. We consequently understand better why
   the prophet lays low all the strength of the world; not, surely, that
   men should lie prostrate, or be so heart-broken as to pine away in
   despair; but that, laying aside their pride, they should fix their
   thoughts on God alone, and persuade themselves that their life depends
   on his protection. Moreover, in saying that the eye of God is bent upon
   them that fear him to save them, he expresses more than if he had said
   that his hand and power were sufficient to preserve them. A doubt might
   creep into the minds of the weak, whether God would extend this
   protection to every individual; but when the Psalmist introduces him as
   keeping watch and ward, as it were, over the safety of the faithful,
   there is no reason why any one of them should tremble, or hesitate with
   himself a moment longer, since it is certain that God is present with
   him to assist him, provided he remain quietly under his providence.
   From this, also, it appears still more clearly how truly he had said a
   little before, that the people are blessed whose God is Jehovah,
   because, without him, all the strength and riches which we may possess
   will be vain, deceitful, and perishing; whereas, with a single look he
   can defend his people, supply their wants, feed them in a time of
   famine, and preserve them alive when they are appointed to death. The
   whole human race, no doubt, are maintained by the providence of God;
   but we know that his fatherly care is specially vouchsafed to none but
   his own children, that they may feel that their necessities are truly
   regarded by him.

   Again, when it is affirmed, that God, in times of famine and dearth,
   has remedies in readiness to preserve the lives of the godly, we are
   taught that the faithful only pay due honor to his providence when they
   allow not their hearts to despond in the extremest indigence; but, on
   the contrary, raise their hopes even from the grave. God often suffers
   his servants to be hungry for a time that he may afterwards satiate
   them, and he overspreads them with the darkness of death that he may
   afterwards restore them to the light of life. Yea, we only begin to
   place our trust firmly in him when death comes to present itself before
   our eyes; for, until we have known by experience the vanity of the aids
   of the world, our affections continue entangled in them, and wedded to
   them. The Psalmist characterises believers by two marks, which
   comprehend the whole perfection of our life. The first is, that we
   reverently serve the Lord; and the second, that we depend upon his
   grace. Hypocrites may loudly boast of their faith, but they have never
   tasted even a little of the divine goodness, so as to be induced to
   look to him for what they need. On the contrary, when the faithful give
   themselves with their whole heart to the service and fear of God, this
   affection springs from faith; or rather the principal part of right
   worship, which the faithful render to God, consists in this, that they
   depend upon his mercy.

   Psalm 33:20-22

   20. Our soul waiteth upon Jehovah, he is our help and our shield. 21.
   Surely our heart shall rejoice in him, because [682] we will trust in
   his holy name. 22. Let thy mercy be upon us, O Jehovah: according as we
   have trusted in thee.


   20. Our soul waiteth upon Jehovah. What the Psalmist has hitherto
   spoken concerning God's providence, and particularly concerning that
   faithful guardianship by which he protects his people, he has spoken
   not so much from himself as from the mouth of the Holy Spirit. He now,
   therefore, in the name of the whole Church, raises his song to declare
   that there is nothing better than to commit our welfare to God. Thus we
   see that the fruit of the preceding doctrine is set forth to all true
   believers, that they may unhesitatingly cast themselves with
   confidence, and with a cheerful heart, upon the paternal care of God.
   In this matter, the Psalmist declares nothing concerning himself in
   particular, but unites the whole of the godly with him in the
   acknowledgement of the same faith. There is an emphasis in the word
   soul which should be attended to; for, although this is a common mode
   of speech among the Hebrews, yet it expresses earnest affection; as if
   believers should say, We sincerely rely upon God with our whole heart,
   accounting him our shield and help.

   21. Surely our heart shall rejoice in him. As the particle ky, ki,
   which is twice employed in this verse, has various meanings in Hebrew,
   it may be understood in a twofold sense here. If we expound it
   affirmatively in both clauses, the sense will be, that believers glory
   both in their joy and in their hope. Nor do I think it improper that
   these two should be referred to distinctly in the same context thus:
   Surely God shall always be our joy; surely his holy name shall be like
   an impregnable fortress for our refuge. Whence is it that believers
   continue perseveringly to call upon God, but because, satisfied with
   his favor, they have always, amidst their sorrows and griefs, this
   comfort, which is sufficient to maintain their cheerfulness? Justly,
   therefore, do believers affirm, in the first place, that their heart
   rejoices in the Lord; because, freed from wandering after the
   fascinations of the world, they neither waver nor hesitate at every
   change of fortune, but place the whole felicity of their life in
   enjoying the free and paternal favor of God. They afterwards add, in
   the second place, that they trust in his holy name. If any one,
   however, choose to understand the particle ky, ki, as meaning because,
   assigning a cause or reason, the sense will be no less properly and
   elegantly expressed in this way: Because our hope is fixed on God, he
   will be equally ready on his part to minister to us continual matter of
   joy. And experience undoubtedly proves, that when men are overwhelmed
   with sorrow, and pine away with care, grief, and anxiety, it is that
   they may receive the recompense of their folly; seeing that there is
   nothing to which they are led with more difficulty, than to set their
   hopes on God alone, and not to exult in their own deceitful
   imaginations, with which they please themselves.

   22. Let thy mercy be on us, O Jehovah! At length the psalm concludes
   with a prayer, which the sacred writer offers in the name of all the
   godly, that God would make them feel from the effect that they have not
   relied on the divine goodness in vain. In the meantime, the Spirit, by
   dictating to us this rule of prayer by the mouth of the prophet,
   teaches us, that the gate of divine grace is opened for us when
   salvation is neither sought nor hoped for from any other quarter. This
   passage gives us another very sweet consolation, namely, that if our
   hope faint not in the midst of our course, we have no reason to fear
   that God will fail to continue his mercy towards us, without
   intermission, to the end of it.

   PSALM 34.

   A Psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, who
   banished him from his presence, and he departed from him.

   David gives thanks to God for a signal deliverance, and takes occasion
   from it to celebrate his perpetual grace towards all the saints, and to
   exhort them both to trust in him, and to the study of godliness;
   affirming, that the only way to pass through life happily, is to walk
   holily and harmlessly in the world, in the service and fear of God. It
   is obvious from the title what particular instance of God's favor he
   here celebrates. When he was driven to King Achish, as recorded in 1
   Samuel 27:2, [683] whom, with the exception of Saul, he accounted the
   deadliest of all his enemies, it was not probable that he would ever be
   able to make his escape from him. The only means, therefore, he had of
   saving his life was to feign himself mad by frothing at the mouth,
   looking fiercely, and disfiguring his countenance. Nor is this to be
   wondered at; for Achish, being disappointed of the confident hope of
   victory which he had, and attributing to David alone both the loss
   which he had sustained and the dishonor which he had received, burned
   with implacable hatred against him. In allowing him to escape,
   therefore, contrary to his own expectation, and the expectation of all
   other men, David acknowledges that there had been exhibited a memorable
   instance of God's favor towards him, which may be serviceable for the
   general instruction of the whole Church. Instead of Achish, [684]
   Abimelech is here employed; and it is probable that the latter name had
   been the common designation of the monarchs of the Philistines, as
   Pharaoh was the common name of the monarchs of Egypt, and Caesar that
   of the Roman Emperors, which was borrowed from the name of Julius
   Caesar, who had first seized the imperial power among the Romans. We
   know that many ages before David was born, the kings who reigned in
   Gerar in the time of Abraham were called Abimelech. It is not,
   therefore, to be wondered at, that this name should be handed down from
   age to age among their posterity, and become the common name of all the
   kings of Palestine. The Hebrew word tm, taäm, which I have translated
   countenance, signifies also tasting, understanding, [685] and therefore
   might be pertinently interpreted in this manner, that he appeared
   foolish and without taste. The verb from which it is derived properly
   signifies to taste, and therefore is often transferred to reason,
   understanding, and all the senses. Accordingly, David having feigned
   himself mad, the term understanding is very appropriate. Now, although
   he escaped by this subtle device, he doubts not that he was delivered
   by the hand of God; nor does he ascribe the praise of his safety to the
   pretense of madness, but rather acknowledges that the cruelty of his
   enemy had been softened by the secret influence of God, so that he who
   formerly burned with rage against him had been pacified by an artifice.
   Certainly it was not to be expected that Achish would have driven away
   in contempt from him so brave a man, whom he had found a dangerous
   enemy to his whole kingdom, and from whom he had suffered such severe
   losses. This gives rise to the question, Whether David feigned himself
   mad under the guidance of the Holy Spirit? For by his appearing to
   connect together these two things, - the pretense of madness and the
   happy result of this pretense, it might be inferred that the same
   Spirit by whom this psalm was dictated suggested this stratagem [686]
   to the mind of David, and directed him in deceiving King Achish. I
   answer, that although God sometimes delivers his people, while at the
   same time they err in choosing the means, or even fall into sin in
   adopting them, yet there is nothing inconsistent in this. The
   deliverance, therefore, was the work of God, but the intermediate sin,
   which is on no account to be excused, ought to be ascribed to David. In
   this way Jacob obtained the blessing by the favor and good pleasure of
   God; and yet the subtlety of the mother, with which the obtaining of it
   was mixed up, was, we know, sinful on her part. It may then sometimes
   happen that the event shall be brought to pass by the Spirit of God,
   and yet the saints whom he may employ as instruments shall swerve from
   the path of duty. It would therefore be a superfluous task to endeavor
   to exculpate David, who is rather to be blamed, because, by not
   committing his life entirely to God, he exposed himself and the grace
   of the Spirit, by whom he was governed, to the derision of the ungodly.
   I would not positively assert it, but there appears in this deception
   some token of infirmity. If it should be said that David here magnifies
   the grace of God, because by changing his countenance and his speech he
   escaped death, I again reply, that David expressly mentions this
   circumstance, in order to render the grace of God still more
   illustrious, in that his fault was not laid to his charge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 34:1-6

   1. I will bless Jehovah at all times: his praise shall always be in my
   mouth. 2. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: the humble shall
   hear of it, and be glad. 3. Magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt
   his name together. 4. I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and
   delivered me from all my fears. 5. They shall look to him, and shall
   flow to him; and their faces shall not be ashamed. 6. This poor man
   cried, and Jehovah heard him, and delivered him from all his troubles.


   1. I will bless Jehovah at all times. [687] David here extols the
   greatness of God, promising to keep in remembrance during his whole
   life the goodness which he had bestowed upon him. God assists his
   people daily, that they may continually employ themselves in praising
   him; yet it is certain that the blessing which is said to be worthy of
   everlasting remembrance is distinguished by this mark from other
   benefits which are ordinary and common. This, therefore, is a rule
   which should be observed by the saints -- they should often call into
   remembrance whatever good has been bestowed upon them by God; but if at
   any time he should display his power more illustriously in preserving
   them from some danger, so much the more does it become them earnestly
   to testify their gratitude. Now if by one benefit alone God lays us
   under obligation to himself all our life, so that we may never lawfully
   cease from setting forth his praises, how much more when he heaps upon
   us innumerable benefits? [688] In order to distinguish the praise which
   he had before said would be continually in his mouth from the empty
   sound of the tongue, in which many hypocrites boast, he adds, in the
   beginning of the second verse, that it would proceed from the heart.

   2. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah. The term soul in this place
   signifies not the vital spirit, but the seat of the affections; as if
   David had said, I shall always have ground of boasting with my whole
   heart in God alone, so that I shall never suffer myself to fall into
   forgetfulness of so great a deliverance. In the second clause he
   specifies this as the fruit of his thanksgiving, that the afflicted and
   miserable shall derive from it ground of hope. The Hebrew word nvym,
   anavim, which we have rendered humble, signifies not all the afflicted
   [689] in general, but those who, being humbled and subdued by
   afflictions, instead of breathing the spirit of pride, are cast down,
   and ready to abase themselves to the very dust. These, he says, shall
   be partakers of his joy; but not, as some have coldly explained it,
   simply from a feeling of sympathy, but because, being persuaded that in
   the example of David, God had given them a general testimony of his
   grace, their hearts would recover from sorrow, and would be lifted up
   on high. Accordingly, he says that this joy shall spring from hope,
   because, having received a pledge of their deliverance, they shall
   cheerfully have recourse to God.

   3. Magnify Jehovah with me. The Psalmist shows still another fruit
   which would be the result of his giving thanks to God, namely, that he
   shall induce others by his example to the same exercise of devotion;
   nay more, he calls upon all the godly to unite with him in this
   exercise, inviting and exhorting them heartily and with one consent to
   extol the Lord. Let us therefore learn, from the many instances in
   which God may have given helps to any of his people, to abound in hope;
   and when each recites the personal benefits which he has received, let
   all be animated unitedly and in a public manner to give praise to God.
   We give thanks publicly to God, not only that men may be witnesses of
   our gratitude, but also that they may follow our example.

   4. I sought Jehovah, and he answered me. The Psalmist here explains
   more plainly and more fully what he had said concerning joy. In the
   first place, he tells us that his prayers had been heard. This he
   applies to all the godly, that, encouraged by a testimony so precious,
   they might stir themselves up to prayer. What is implied in seeking God
   is evident from the following clause. In some places it is to be
   understood in a different sense, namely, to bend the mind in earnest
   application to the service of God, and to have all its thoughts
   directed to him. Here it simply means to have recourse to him for help;
   for it immediately follows that God answered him; and he is properly
   said to answer prayer and supplication. By his fears the Psalmist
   means, taking the effect for the cause, the dangers which sorely
   disquieted his mind; yet doubtless he confesses that he had been
   terrified and agitated by fears. He did not look upon his dangers with
   a calm and untroubled mind, as if he viewed them at a distance and from
   some elevated position, but being grievously tormented with innumerable
   cares, he might justly speak of his fears and terrors. Nay more, by the
   use of the plural number, he shows that he had been greatly terrified
   not only in one way, but that he had been distracted by a variety of
   troubles. On the one hand, he saw a cruel death awaiting him; while on
   the other, his mind may have been filled with fear, lest Achish should
   send him to Saul for his gratification, as the ungodly are wont to make
   sport to themselves of the children of God. And since he had already
   been detected and betrayed once, he might well conclude, even if he
   should escape, that the hired assassins of Saul would lay wait for him
   on all sides. The hatred too which Achish had conceived against him,
   both for the death of Goliath and the destruction of his own army,
   might give rise to many fears; especially considering that his enemy
   might instantly wreak his vengeance upon him, and that he had good
   reason to think that his cruelty was such as would not be appeased by
   subjecting him to some mild form of death. [690] We ought to mark this
   particularly, in order that, if at any time we are terrified because of
   the dangers which surround us, we may not be prevented by our
   effeminacy from calling upon God. Even David, who is known to have
   surpassed others in heroism and bravery, had not such a heart of iron
   as to repel all fears and alarms, but was sometimes greatly disquieted
   and smitten with fear.

   5. They shall look to him, and shall flow to him. I have already
   intimated, that this verse and the following should be read in
   connection with the preceding verse. In relating his own experience
   David has furnished an example to others, that they should freely and
   without fear approach God in order to present their prayers before him.
   Now, he says that they shall come, and this too with a happy issue. The
   first two verbs are expressed in the past time in the Hebrew; but I
   have, notwithstanding, no doubt that the sentence ought to be explained
   thus: When they shall have looked to him, and flowed to him, their
   faces shall not be ashamed. I have therefore translated them in the
   future tense. David is not relating things which had happened, but is
   commending the fruit of the favor which had been manifested to himself.
   Some interpreters, I know, refer the words to him to David, [691]
   because immediately after he speaks of himself in the third person.
   Others with greater propriety explain it; of God himself. A difference
   of opinion also exists as to the Hebrew verb nhrv, naharu, which some,
   supposing it to be derived from the root 'vr, or, render to be
   enlightened. [692] But, in my opinion, the natural signification of the
   word appears very appropriate to this place; as if he had said, There
   shall now be a mirror set forth, in which men may behold the face of
   God serene and merciful; and therefore the poor and afflicted shall
   henceforth dare to lift up their eyes to God, and to resort to him with
   the utmost freedom, because no uncertainty shall any longer retard them
   or render them slothful. If, however, any one should prefer the word
   enlighten, the meaning will be, They who formerly languished in
   darkness shall lift up their eyes to God, as if a light had suddenly
   appeared unto them, and they who were cast down and overwhelmed with
   shame, shall again clothe their countenances with cheerfulness. But as
   the meaning in either case is substantially the same, I am not much
   disposed to contend which of the two interpretations ought to be
   preferred.

   6. This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him. David here introduces
   all the godly speaking of himself, the more emphatically to express how
   much weight there is in his example to encourage them. This poor man,
   say they, cried; therefore God invites all the poor to cry to him. They
   contemplate in David what belongs to the common benefit of all the
   godly; for God is as willing and ready at this day to hear all the
   afflicted who direct their sighs, wishes, and cries, to him with the
   same faith, as he was at that time to hear David.

   [691] Those who take this view explain the words as meaning that the
   humble or afflicted, upon looking to David, saw how graciously God had
   dealt with him, and were enlightened, revived, and encouraged. They
   also consider, as Calvin himself does, the humble or afflicted as the
   persons who speak in the sixth verse, where, pointing as it were with
   the finger to David, they say, "This poor man cried," etc.

   [692] This is the rendering adopted by Horsley, who understands by the
   expression the illumination of the soul by the light of Divine truth.
   He reads the verb in the imperative mood, and his translation of the
   entire verse is as follows: "Look towards him, and thou shalt be
   enlightened;
   And your faces shall never be ashamed." This reading is sanctioned by
   the Septuagint. It supposes two alterations on the text. First, that
   instead of hvytv, they looked, we should read hvytv, habitu, look ye;
   and this last reading is supported by several of Dr Kennicott's and De
   Rossi's MSS. The other alteration is, that instead of vphnyhs,
   upeneyhem, their faces, we should read vphnyks, upeneykem, your faces.
   Poole, in defense of reading your instead of their, observes, "that the
   change of persons is very frequent in this book."

   Psalm 34:7-10

   7. The angel of Jehovah encampeth [693] round about them that fear him,
   and will deliver them. 8. Taste and see that Jehovah is good: blessed
   is the man who trusteth in him. 9. Fear Jehovah, ye his saints, for
   there is no want to them that fear him. 10. The young lions are
   destitute and famished: but they who fear Jehovah shall not want any
   good thing.


   7. The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him. David
   here discourses in general of God's fatherly favor towards all the
   godly; and as the life of man is exposed to innumerable dangers, he at
   the same time teaches us that God is able to deliver them. The faithful
   especially, who are as sheep in the midst of wolves, beset as it were
   with death in every form, are constantly harassed with the dread of
   some approaching danger. David therefore affirms, that the servants of
   God are protected and defended by angels. The design of the Psalmist is
   to show, that although the faithful are exposed to many dangers, yet
   they may rest assured that God will be the faithful guardian of their
   life. But in order to confirm them the more in this hope, he adds at
   the same time, and not without reason, that those whom God would
   preserve in safety he defends by the power and ministration of angels.
   The power of God alone would indeed be sufficient of itself to perform
   this; but in mercy to our infirmity he vouchsafes to employ angels as
   his ministers. It serves not a little for the confirmation of our faith
   to know that God has innumerable legions of angels who are always ready
   for his service as often as he is pleased to aid us; nay, more, that
   the angels too, who are called principalities and powers, are ever
   intent upon the preservation of our life, because they know that this
   duty is intrusted to them. God is indeed designated with propriety the
   wall of his Church, and every kind of fortress and place of defense
   [694] to her; but in accommodation to the measure and extent of our
   present imperfect state, he manifests the presence of his power to aid
   us through the instrumentality of his angels. Moreover, what the
   Psalmist here says of one angel in the singular number, ought to be
   applied to all the other angels: for they are distinguished by the
   general appellation of

   "ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be the
   heirs of salvation," (Hebrews 1:14;)

   and the Scriptures in other places teach us, that whenever it pleases
   God, and whenever he knows it to be for their benefit, many angels are
   appointed to take care of each of his people, (2 Kings 6:15; Psalm
   91:11; Luke 16:22.) The amount then of what has been said is, that
   however great the number of our enemies and the dangers by which we are
   surrounded may be, yet the angels of God, armed with invincible power,
   constantly watch over us, and array themselves on every side to aid and
   deliver us from all evil.

   8. Taste and see that Jehovah is good. In this verse the Psalmist
   indirectly reproves men for their dulness in not perceiving the
   goodness of God, which ought to be to them more than matter of simple
   knowledge. By the word taste he at once shows that they are without
   taste; and at the same time he assigns the reason of this to be, that
   they devour the gifts of God without relishing them, or through a
   vitiated loathing ungratefully conceal them. He, therefore, calls upon
   them to stir up their senses, and to bring a palate endued with some
   capacity of tasting, that God's goodness may become known to them, or
   rather, be made manifest to them. The words literally rendered are,
   Taste and see, for the Lord is good; but the particle ky, ki, for, is
   taken exegetically. David's meaning, therefore, is, that there is
   nothing on the part of God to prevent the godly, to whom he
   particularly speaks in this place, from arriving at the knowledge of
   his goodness by actual experience. From this it follows, that they also
   are infected with the common malady of dulness. This doctrine is
   confirmed by the promise immediately added, Blessed is the man who
   trusteth in him; for God never disappoints the expectations of those
   who seek his favor. Our own unbelief is the only impediment which
   prevents him from satisfying us largely and bountifully with abundance
   of all good things.

   9. Fear Jehovah, ye his saints. Here the people of God are exhorted to
   the pursuit of holiness and righteousness, that they may open up a
   channel for divine blessings. We know that men are accustomed to
   provide for their wants, by resorting to fraud, plunder, and even to
   wrongful violence. Nor is it possible but that the faithful must feel
   some stirrings of a desire to imitate the wicked, and envy them in some
   degree in their prosperity, so that they permit themselves sometimes to
   howl among the wolves. And although they voluntarily abstain from all
   wrongful violence, yet the common way of living among those around them
   carries them away like a tempest; and, in the meantime, they think that
   the plea of necessity is sufficient to excuse them. David represses, as
   with a bridle, these temptations, promising that all will be well with
   the people of God, provided they keep themselves in the fear of God,
   which he opposes to all wicked and deceitful counsels; because the
   greater part of men reckon those to be fools who aim at simplicity,
   since in so doing they do not consult their own interests and profit.
   While, therefore, ungodly men are afraid of poverty, and carnal reason
   urges them to attempt whatever their fancy may suggest for keeping
   themselves from it, David here testifies that God takes care of the
   godly, so that he never suffers them to be in want. Let no fear or
   distrust, says he, withdraw you from the pursuit of what is right,
   because God never forsakes those who walk righteously before him. The
   Psalmist, therefore, bids them yield to God the honor of expecting more
   from him alone than the wicked expect from their deceitful traffic and
   unlawful practices. Moreover, as iniquity rages with unbridled fury
   everywhere throughout the world, he calls expressly upon the saints to
   be on their guard, because he would be of no service to the promiscuous
   multitude. It is a sentiment contrary to the generally received opinion
   among men, that while the integrity of the good and simple is exposed
   to the will of the wicked, there should yet be greater security in
   integrity than in all the resources of fraud and injustice. There is,
   therefore, no inconsistency in his admonishing the saints who, of their
   own accord, are endeavoring to walk uprightly, not to depart from the
   fear of God; for we know how easily the light of piety may be obscured
   and extinguished, when there appears no hope of living happily and
   prosperously, except in the pursuit of the world and its enticing
   pleasures.

   The Psalmist illustrates this doctrine by a very apposite comparison,
   namely, that God provides every thing necessary for his people, and
   relieves their wants, whilst the lions, which surpass in ferocity all
   the wild beasts of the earth, prowl about in a famishing condition for
   their prey. Some think, that under the name of lions, those men who are
   addicted to violence and plunder are metaphorically described; but
   this, in my opinion, is too refined. David simply asserts, that those
   who guard against all unrighteousness should profit more by so doing
   than by rapine and plunder; because the Lord feeds his people, while
   even the lions and other beasts of prey often suffer hunger. What he
   says, then, is, that sooner shall the lions perish with hunger and
   want, than God will disappoint of their necessary food the righteous
   and sincere, who, content with his blessing alone, seek their food only
   from his hand. Whoever, therefore, shall in this way cast his cares
   upon God, and confide implicitly in his paternal goodness and bounty,
   shall live quietly and peaceably among men, and suffer no injury. If it
   is objected, that the good and the virtuous are not always exempted
   from penury, I answer, that the hand of God is stretched out to succor
   them in due season, when they are reduced to the greatest straits, and
   know not to what side to turn, [695] so that the issue always shows
   that we seek not in vain from him whatever is necessary to the
   sustenance of life.

   Psalm 34:11-14

   11. Come, children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of
   Jehovah. 12. Who is the man who desireth life, loving days in which he
   may see good? 13. Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
   deceit. 14. Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue
   it.


   11. Come, children, [696] hearken unto me. The Psalmist continues, with
   increased earnestness, to exhort the faithful, that they may know that
   nothing can be more profitable for them than to conduct themselves
   justly and harmlessly towards all men. As the greater part of men
   imagine that the best and the shortest way to attain a life of
   happiness and ease consists in striving to surpass other men in
   violence, fraud, injustice, and other means of mischief, it is
   necessary frequently to repeat this doctrine. Moreover, as it is
   necessary that the minds of men should be brought to a chastened and
   humble state, by calling them his children, he endeavors, by this
   gentle and courteous appellation, to allay all froward affections. None
   will stand unmoved amidst so many assaults, but those who have been
   endued by the Spirit of meekness with the greatest modesty. The
   prophet, therefore, tells them at the outset, that the rule of life
   which he prescribes can be observed and obeyed by those only who are
   meek and submissive. To the same purpose is the word come, and the
   command to hearken; and they imply, that men laying aside all
   wilfulness of spirit, and having subdued the ardor and impetuosity of
   their minds, should become docile and meek. He has put the fear of the
   Lord for the rule of a pious and holy life: as if he had said, Whilst
   virtue and righteousness are in every man's mouth, there are few who
   lead a holy life, and live as they ought; because they know not what it
   is to serve God.

   12. Who is the man who desireth life? The prophet does not inquire if
   there be any man so disposed, as if all men voluntarily brought upon
   themselves the miseries which befall them; for we know that all men
   without exception desire to live in the enjoyment of happiness. But he
   censures severely the blindness and folly which men exhibit in the
   frowardness of their desires, and the vanity of their endeavors to
   obtain happiness; for while all men are seeking, and eagerly intent
   upon acquiring what is for their profit, there will be found scarcely
   one in a hundred who studies to purchase peace, and a quiet and
   desirable state of life, by just and equitable means. The prophet
   therefore admonishes his disciples, that nearly the whole world are
   deceived and led astray by their own folly, while they promise
   themselves a happy life from any other source than the divine blessing,
   which God bestows only upon the sincere and upright in heart. But there
   is in this exclamation still greater vehemence, the more effectually to
   awaken dull and drowsy minds to the course of this world; as if he had
   said, Since all men earnestly desire happiness, how comes it to pass,
   that scarcely any one sets himself to obtain it, and that every man, by
   his own fault, rather brings upon himself various troubles?

   13. Keep thy tongue from evil The precept which David here delivers
   relates to a virtue which is very rare, namely, that we should be
   truthful and free from deceit in our discourse. Some, indeed,
   understand it in a much more extended sense, supposing that slander is
   condemned in this first clause. But it seems to me more simple, and
   more to the purpose, to understand this as of the same import with what
   he repeats in the second clause, that we should not speak deceitfully
   with our neighbors, so as that our words may prove the means of
   ensnaring them. And since nothing is more difficult than to regulate
   our discourse in such a manner as that our speech may be a true
   representation of our hearts, David calls upon us to exercise over it a
   strict and watchful control, not suffering it to run riot, lest it
   should prove the occasion of our deceiving others.

   14. Turn away from evil, and do good. Here the Psalmist commands the
   children of God to abstain from all evil, and to devote themselves to
   the work of doing good to their neighbors. This verse is generally
   quoted as if David here treated of the two parts of repentance. The
   first step in the work of repentance is, that the sinner forsake the
   vices to which he is addicted, and renounce his former manner of life;
   and the second, that he frame his behavior according to righteousness.
   But in this place we are more especially taught how we ought to deal
   with our neighbors. As it often happens, that the man who is not only
   liberal, but also prodigal towards some, or, at least, helps many by
   acts of kindness, wrongs others by defrauding and injuring them, David,
   with much propriety, begins by saying, that those who desire to have
   their life approved before God, ought to abstain from doing evil. On
   the other hand, since many think, that provided they have neither
   defrauded, nor wronged, nor injured any man, they have discharged the
   duty which God requires from them, he has added, with equal propriety,
   the other precept concerning doing good to our neighbors. It is not the
   will of God that his servants should be idle, but rather that they
   should aid one another, desiring each other's welfare and prosperity,
   and promoting it as far as in them lies. David next inculcates the duty
   of maintaining peace: Seek peace, and pursue it. Now we know that this
   is maintained by gentleness and forbearance. But as we have often to do
   with men of a fretful, or factious, or stubborn spirit, or with such as
   are always ready to stir up strife upon the slightest occasion; and as
   also many wicked persons irritate us; and as others by their own
   wickedness alienate, as much as in them lies, the minds of good men
   from them, and others industriously strive to find grounds of
   contention; he teaches us not merely that we ought to seek peace, but
   if at any time it shall seem to flee from us, he bids us use our every
   effort without ceasing in pursuing it. This, however, must be
   understood with some limitation. It will often happen, that when good
   and humble men have done every thing in their power to secure peace, so
   far from softening the hearts of the wicked, or inclining them to
   uprightness, they rather excite their malice. Their impiety, also,
   often constrains us to separate from them, and to avoid them; nay, when
   they defy God, by proclaiming, as it were, open war against him, it
   would be disloyalty and treason on our part not to oppose and resist
   them. But here David means only that in our own personal affairs we
   should be meek and condescending, and endeavor, as far as in us lies,
   to maintain peace, though its maintenance should prove to us a source
   of much trouble and inconvenience.

   Psalm 15-17

   15. The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
   to their cry. 16. The face of Jehovah [697] is upon them that do evil,
   to cut off their remembrance from the earth. 17. They cried, and
   Jehovah heard them, and delivered them from all their troubles.


   15. The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous. The best support of our
   patience is a firm persuasion that God regards us, and that according
   as every man perseveres in a course of uprightness and equity, so shall
   he be preserved in peace and safety under his protection. In order,
   therefore, that the faithful may not think that they are exposed to the
   caprice of the world, while they are endeavoring to keep themselves
   innocent, and that they may not, under the influence of this fear, go
   astray from the right path, David exhorts them to reflect upon the
   providence of God, and to rest assured that they are safe under his
   wings. He says, then, that the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
   to preserve them, in order that the good and simple may persevere the
   more cheerfully in their uprightness. At the same time, he encourages
   them to supplication and prayer, if at any time the world should
   unjustly persecute them. In saying that the ears of the Lord are open
   to their cry, he teaches that the man who is wantonly and unjustly
   persecuted, will find a ready and suitable remedy in all afflictions,
   by calling upon God as his avenger. On the other hand, he declares,
   that although God sometimes appears to wink at the misdeeds of men, and
   seems to overlook them, because he does not inflict immediate
   punishment upon them, yet nothing escapes his inspection. Whilst the
   wicked, says he, by reason of their impunity harden themselves in sin,
   God is watching, that he may cut off their remembrance from the earth,
   (1 Peter 5:10.) He speaks particularly of this kind of punishment,
   because the ungodly not only expect that they shall be happy during
   their whole life, but also imagine that they shall enjoy immortality in
   this world. Peter, in his First Epistle, [698] applies this passage
   very judiciously, for the purpose of assuaging our sorrows and
   appeasing our impatience, as often as the pride and arrogance of the
   wicked may carry us beyond due limits. Nothing is more useful for
   preserving our moderation than to depend upon God's help, and having
   the testimony of a good conscience, to rely upon his judgment. If it is
   objected, that good men experience the contrary, who, after having been
   long afflicted, at length find no help or comfort; I reply, that the
   aid which God affords to the righteous is not always made manifest, nor
   bestowed in the same measure; and yet he so alleviates their troubles
   as never to forsake them. Besides, even the best of men often deprive
   themselves of the help of God; for scarcely one in a hundred perseveres
   in such a course of integrity as not, by his own fault, to deserve the
   infliction of some evil upon himself. But as soon as they fall, lest
   sin should take root in them, God chastises them, and often punishes
   them more severely than the reprobate, whom he spares to utter
   destruction. [699] And yet, however much things may appear to be
   mingled and confused in the world, good men will find that God has not
   promised them help in vain against the violence and injuries of the
   wicked.

   17. They [700] cried, and Jehovah heard them. The Psalmist's meaning
   is, that they are heard as often as they cry. This is a doctrine
   applicable to all times; and David does not merely relate what God has
   done once or twice, but what he is accustomed to do. It is also a
   confirmation of the preceding sentence, where he had said that the ears
   of the Lord are open to the cry of the righteous; for he now
   demonstrates by the effect, that God is not deaf when we lay our
   complaints and groanings before him. By the word cry we are taught,
   that although God defend the righteous, they are not exempt from
   adversity. He regulates the protection which he affords them in such a
   wonderful manner, as that he notwithstanding exercises them by various
   trials. In like manner, when we here see that deliverance is promised
   only to those who call upon God, this ought to prove no small
   encouragement to us to pray to him; for it is not his will that the
   godly should so regard his providence as to indulge in idleness, but
   rather that, being firmly persuaded that he is the guardian of their
   safety, they should direct their prayers and supplications to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [697] That is, the anger of God. The face of God is often put for the
   anger of God, because this passion manifests itself particularly in the
   face. Thus in Lamentations 4:16, we read, "The anger [literally faces]
   of the Lord hath divided them." And in Leviticus 20:3, we read, "I will
   set my face [that is, my anger] against that man."

   [698] In his First Epistle, (1 Peter 3:10, 11, 12,) he quotes the 12,
   13, 14, 15, and 16 verses of this psalm. He quotes from the Septuagint.

   [699] "Lesquels il espargne pour un temps, afin de les ruiner
   eternellement." -- "Whom he spares for a time, to destroy them
   eternally." -- Fr.

   [700] It is wicked men who are spoken of in the immediately preceding
   verse; but they here evidently refers not to them, but to the
   righteous, mentioned in the fifteenth verse; and, accordingly, in all
   the ancient versions, and in our English Bible, the words the righteous
   are supplied. It is supposed by those who make this supplement, that
   the word tsdyqym, tsaddikim, has been lost out of the text. But if we
   read the 16th verse as a parenthesis, it will not be necessary to make
   any supplement, and the words may be read exactly as they are in the
   Hebrew, They cried.

   those who are bruised of spirit. 19. Many are the afflictions of the
   righteous; but Jehovah will deliver him from them all. 20. He keepeth
   all his bones: not one of them is broken [701] 21. But malice shall
   slay the wicked; and those who hate the righteous shall be destroyed.
   22. Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants, and those who trust in
   him shall not perish.


   18. Jehovah is nigh to those who are broken of heart. David here
   exemplifies and extends still more the preceding doctrine, that God is
   the deliverer of his people, even when they are brought very low, and
   when they are, as it were, half-dead. It is a very severe trial, when
   the grace of God is delayed, and all experience of it so far withdrawn,
   as that our spirits begin to fail; nay more, to say that God is nigh to
   the faithful, even when their hearts faint and fall them, and they are
   ready to die, is altogether incredible to human sense and reason. But
   by this means his power shines forth more clearly, when he raises us up
   again from the grave. Moreover, it is meet that the faithful should be
   thus utterly cast down and afflicted, that they may breathe again in
   God alone. From this we also learn, that nothing is more opposed to
   true patience than the loftiness of heart of which the Stoics boast;
   for we are not accounted truly humbled until true affliction of heart
   has abased us before God, so that, having prostrated ourselves in the
   dust before him, he may raise us up. It is a doctrine full of the
   sweetest consolation, that God departs not from us, even when we are
   overwhelmed by a succession of miseries, and, as it were, almost
   deprived of life.

   19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. The Psalmist here
   anticipates the thought which often arises in the mind, "How can it be
   that God has a care about the righteous, who are continually harassed
   with so many calamities and trials? for what purpose does the
   protection of God serve, unless those who are peaceably inclined enjoy
   peace and repose? and what is more unreasonable, than that those who
   cause trouble to no one should themselves be tormented and afflicted in
   all variety of ways?" That, therefore, the temptations by which we are
   continually assailed may not shake our belief in the providence of God,
   we ought to remember this lesson of instruction, that although God
   governs the righteous, and provides for their safety, they are yet
   subject and exposed to many miseries, that, being tested by such
   trials, they may give evidence of their invincible constancy, and
   experience so much the more that God is their deliverer. If they were
   exempted from every kind of trial, their faith would languish, they
   would cease to call upon God, and their piety would remain hidden and
   unknown. It is, therefore, necessary that they should be exercised with
   various trials, and especially for this end, that they may acknowledge
   that they have been wonderfully preserved by God amidst numberless
   deaths. If this should seldom happen, it might appear to be fortuitous,
   or the result of chance; but when innumerable and interminable evils
   come upon them in succession, the grace of God cannot be unknown, when
   he always stretches forth his hand to them. David, therefore,
   admonishes the faithful never to lose their courage, whatever evils may
   threaten them; since God, who can as easily deliver them a thousand
   times as once from death, will never disappoint their expectation. What
   he adds concerning their bones, seems not a little to illustrate the
   truth of this doctrine, and to teach us that those who are protected by
   God shall be free from all danger. He therefore declares, that God will
   take care that not one of their bones shall be broken; in which sense
   Christ also says, that

   "the very hairs of our head are all numbered," (Luke 12:7.)

   21. But malice shall slay the wicked. The Hebrew word rh, raäh, which I
   have translated malice, some would rather render misery, so that the
   meaning would be, that the ungodly shall perish miserably, because in
   the end they shall be overwhelmed with calamities. The other
   translation, however, is more expressive, namely, that their
   wickedness, with which they think themselves fortified, shall fall upon
   their own heads. As David therefore taught before, that there was no
   defense better than a just and blameless life, so now he declares, that
   all the wicked enterprises of the wicked, even though no one should in
   any thing oppose them, shall turn to their own destruction. In the
   second clause of the verse he states, that it is for the sake of the
   righteous that it is ordered, that the ungodly are themselves the cause
   and instruments of their own destruction. Those, says he, who hate the
   righteous shall be destroyed Let this, therefore, be to us as a wall of
   brass and sure defense; that however numerous the enemies which beset
   us may be, we should not be afraid, because they are already devoted to
   destruction. The same thing David confirms in the last verse, in which
   he says, that Jehovah redeems the soul of his servants How could they
   be preserved in safety, even for a moment, among so many dangers,
   unless God interposed his power for their defense? But by the word
   redeem there is expressed a kind of preservation which is repugnant to
   the flesh. For it is necessary that we should first be adjudged or
   doomed to death, before God should appear as our redeemer. From this it
   follows, that those who hurry forward too precipitately, and are unable
   to realize God's power unless he appear speedily, working deliverance
   for them, intercept the communication of his grace. Moreover, that none
   might form their judgment of the servants of God by moral or
   philosophic virtue only, as it is called, David specifies this as a
   principal mark by which they may be known, that they trust in God, on
   whom also their salvation depends.

   PSALM 35.

   So long as Saul was the enemy of David, the nobles, and such as at that
   time bore any authority, had (according to the subservient spirit which
   always prevails in the courts of kings) eagerly conspired to destroy an
   innocent man. They had also succeeded in inducing the common people to
   participate with them in their hatred and cruelty, so that all of them,
   from the highest to the lowest, burned with implacable hatred against
   him. But as he knew that the greatest part of them were thoughtlessly
   impelled to this by error and folly, and ignorance of the true state of
   affairs, he accounts those only his enemies who, from deliberate malice
   and wickedness, endeavored in this way to please Saul, in order to
   obtain his favor. Against them he calls upon God for vengeance. And,
   first, as he was conscious of no crime, he alleges his innocence before
   God; and, secondly, as they sought to inflict unmerited punishment upon
   him, he implores God for deliverance. After he has complained of their
   impious cruelty, he calls down upon them the punishment which they
   deserved. Moreover, as in confident reliance upon the oracle of God,
   which had been spoken by Samuel, and the holy anointing, he hoped for a
   better issue, he intersperses throughout the psalm testimonies of his
   thankfulness. Finally, he concludes the psalm by saying, that after he
   has been delivered, he will celebrate the praises of God all his life.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 35:1-3

   1. Plead my cause, O Jehovah! with them that plead against me; fight
   against them who fight against me. 2. Take the shield and the buckler,
   and rise up for my help. 3. Bring forth the spear, and oppose my
   persecutors: say unto my soul, "I am thy salvation."


   1. Plead my cause, O Jehovah! As the enemies of David not only avowedly
   sought to take away his life, but also troubled him by calumny and
   misrepresentation, he pleads for the redress of both these grievances.
   In the first place, by appealing to God for his aid in defense of his
   cause, he intimates, that he has to do with wicked and maligning men.
   In the second place, by urging him to take up arms, he shows that he
   was grievously oppressed. It was a very dishonorable thing, that this
   holy man, alike eminent for his beneficence and inoffensiveness towards
   all men, and who by his courtesy and meekness had merited, both in
   public and private, the esteem and favor of all, was not permitted to
   escape the reproach and calumny of wicked men; but it is important for
   us to know this, and it sets before us a very profitable example. If
   even David did not escape the malice of wicked men, it ought not to
   seem wonderful or strange to us, if they blame and bite at us. The
   injuries they inflict upon us may be grievous and painful, but there is
   incomparable consolation presented to us in this consideration, that
   God himself interposes for our protection and defense against false
   accusations. Though calumniators, then, should arise, and tear us, as
   it were, to pieces, by falsely charging us with crimes, we need not be
   disturbed, so long as God undertakes to plead our cause against them.
   There can be no doubt, that in the second clause of the verse David
   implores God to resist the armed violence of his enemies. The amount of
   the whole is, that being falsely accused and cruelly persecuted, and
   finding no help at the hands of men, the Prophet commits the
   preservation of his life and his reputation to God.

   2. Take the shield. These words certainly cannot be applied, in the
   strict and proper sense, to God, who has no need of the spear or
   buckler: for by the breath of his mouth alone, or merely with his nod,
   he is able to overthrow all his enemies. But although such figures at
   first sight appear rude, yet the Holy Ghost employs them in
   accommodation to the weakness of our understanding, for the purpose of
   impressing more effectually upon our minds the conviction that God is
   present to aid us. When troubles and dangers arise, when terrors assail
   us on every side, when even death presents itself to our view, it is
   difficult to realize the secret and invisible power of God, which is
   able to deliver us from all anxiety and fear; for our understandings,
   which are gross and earthly, tend downward to the earth. That our
   faith, therefore, may ascend by degrees to the heavenly power of God,
   he is here introduced armed, after the manner of men, with sword and
   shield. In the same way, also, when he is in another place termed "a
   man of war," it is doubtless in adaptation to the imperfection of our
   present state, because our minds, from their limited capacity, could in
   no other way comprehend the extent of that infinite power, which
   contains in itself every form of help, and has no need of aid from any
   other quarter. This, therefore, is a prayer that God, by the exercise
   of his secret and intrinsic power, would show that he alone is able to
   encounter the whole strength and forces of the ungodly. Some suppose
   that the Hebrew word tsnh, tsinnah, here used, means a dart, or some
   other kind of weapon; but as we have already seen, in the fifth psalm,
   that it properly signifies a buckler, I see no reason why it should be
   differently interpreted in this place. Nor is there any thing at all
   inconsistent in connecting here, as is often done in other places, the
   buckler and the shield. [702] If the expression here employed had been
   designed to signify a dart, or a similar weapon, it would have been
   more natural to connect it with the spear, of which mention is made in
   the following verse. David, then, first makes mention of defensive
   armor, praying that God would sustain and repel the assaults of the
   enemy. The Hebrew word ryq, rik, which signifies to unsheath, or make
   bare, I take simply to mean, to draw out, or bring forth. The Hebrew
   word sgvr, segor, which I have translated to oppose, literally
   signifies to shut or to close. But as David's meaning is, that God, by
   setting himself as a wall or rampart, would prevent his enemies from
   approaching him, it appears to me that I have faithfully translated it.
   At the same time, if any should prefer the translation to shut, or
   close the way, or to impede it by some obstacle, the meaning; is
   substantially the same. The opinion of those who contend that it is a
   noun, [703] is not at all probable.

   3. Say to my soul. Some expound these words thus: Declare to me by
   secret inspiration; and others, Make me to feel indeed that my
   salvation is in thy hand. In my opinion, David desires to have it
   thoroughly fixed in his mind, and to be fully persuaded that God is the
   author of his salvation. This he was unable, from the present aspect of
   things, to ascertain and determine; for such is the insensibility and
   dulness of our natures, that God often delivers us whilst we sleep and
   are ignorant of it. Accordingly, he makes use of a very forcible manner
   of expression, in praying that God would grant him a lively sense of
   his favor, so that being armed with this buckler, he might sustain
   every conflict, and surmount every opposing obstacle; as if he had
   said, Lord, whatever may arise to discourage me, confirm me in this
   persuasion, that my salvation is assuredly in thee; and although
   temptations drive me hither and thither, recall my thoughts to thee in
   such a manner, as that my hope of salvation may rise superior to all
   the dangers to which I shall be exposed; [704] nay, more, that I may
   become as infallibly certain as if thou hadst said it, that through thy
   favor I shall be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [702] The word rendered shield is in the Hebrew text mgk, magen, which
   was a short buckler intended merely for defense. The word rendered
   buckler is tsnh, tsinnah, for an account of which see [12]note, p. 64.
   The tsinnah was double the weight of the magen, and was carried by the
   infantry; the magen, being lighter and more manageable, was used by the
   cavalry. The tsinnah answered to the scutum, and the magen to the
   clypeus, among the Romans. -- See Paxton's Illustrations of Scripture,
   vol. 3, pp. 866, 867.

   [703] Those who are of opinion that sgvr, segor, is a noun, translate
   it "the scymitar," and read, "Draw out the spear, and the scymitar, to
   oppose my persecutors." According to Drusius, Vitringa, Michaelis, Dr
   Kennicott, and others, the word means sagaris, or scymitar, a sort of
   battle-axe, which was used by the Persians, Scythians, and other
   nations in ancient times.

   Psalm 35:4-7

   4. Let those who seek my soul be confounded and put to shame; and let
   those who devise my hurt be turned back, and brought to confusion. 5.
   Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the angel of Jehovah
   thrust [or impel] them. [705] 6. Let their way be darkness and
   slipperiness, and let the angel of Jehovah pursue them. 7. For they
   have hid for me without cause their net in a pit, without cause they
   have digged a pit [706] for my soul.


   4. Let those who seek my soul be confounded. David now calls upon God
   to take vengeance upon his enemies; and he asks not only that he would
   disappoint and destroy their designs, but also that he would recompense
   them according to their deserts. In the first place, he desires that
   they may be confounded and put to shame in seeing their expectation and
   desire fail; and then he proceeds farther, desiring that while they
   imagine themselves to be firmly established, and deeply rooted, they
   may be like chaff or stubble. As the chaff is driven with the wind, so
   also he desires, that, being disquieted by the secret impulse of the
   angel of the Lord, they may never have rest. The imprecation which
   follows is even more dreadful, and it is this: that wherever they go
   they may meet with darkness and slippery places; and that in their
   doubt and perplexity the angel of the Lord would pursue them. In fine,
   whatever they devise, and to whatever side they turn, he prays that all
   their counsels and enterprises may come to a disastrous termination.
   When he desires that they may be driven by the angel of the Lord, we
   learn from this that the reason why the ungodly are troubled, though no
   man pursues them, is, that God smites them with a spirit of amazement,
   and distracts them with such fears that they tremble and are troubled.

   The same thing he expresses more clearly in the following verse,
   praying that the angel of the Lord would drive them through dark and
   slippery places, so that reason and understanding might fail them, and
   that they might not know whither to go, nor what to become, nor have
   even time given them to draw their breath. We need not be surprised
   that this work should be assigned to the angels, by whose
   instrumentality God executes his judgments. At the same time, this
   passage may be expounded of the devils as well as of the holy angels,
   who are ever ready to execute the divine behests. We know that the
   devil is permitted to exercise his dominion over the reprobate; and
   hence it is often said that "an evil spirit from God came upon Saul,"
   (1 Samuel 18:10.) But as the devils never execute the will of God,
   unless compelled to do it when God wishes to serve himself of them; the
   Sacred Scriptures declare that the holy and elect angels are in a much
   higher sense the servants of God. God, then, executes his judgments by
   the wicked and reprobate angels; but he gives the elect angels the
   pre-eminence over them. On this account, also, good angels only are
   called rightfully "principalities," as in Ephesians 3:10; Colossians
   1:16, and other similar passages. If it is objected that it is not meet
   that the angels, who are the ministers of grace and salvation, and the
   appointed guardians of the faithful, should be employed in executing
   judgment upon the reprobate, the explanation is simply this, that they
   cannot watch for the preservation of the godly without being prepared
   for fighting -- that they cannot succor them by their aid without also
   opposing their enemies, and declaring themselves to be against them.
   The style of imprecation which the Psalmist here employs can be
   explained only by bearing in mind what I have elsewhere said, namely,
   that David pleads not simply his own cause, nor utters rashly the
   dictates of passion, nor with unadvised zeal desires the destruction of
   his enemies; but under the guidance of the Holy Spirit he entertains
   and expresses against the reprobate such desires as were characterised
   by great moderation, and which were far removed from the spirit of
   those who are impelled either by desire of revenge or hatred, or some
   other inordinate emotion of the flesh.

   7. For they have hid for me without a cause. He here declares that he
   did not take the name of God in vain, nor call upon him for protection
   without just cause, for he openly asserts his innocence, and complains
   that he was thus severely afflicted without having committed any crime,
   or given any occasion to his enemies. It becomes us carefully to mark
   this, so that no one may rush unadvisedly into God's presence, nor call
   upon him for vengeance, without the assurance and testimony of a good
   conscience. When he says that he was assailed by stratagem, fraud, and
   wicked practices, there is implied in this a tacit commendation of his
   own integrity.

   Psalm 35:8-10

   8. Let confusion of which he is not aware come upon him; and let his
   own net which he hath hidden catch himself: let him fall into it with
   confusion. 9. And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, it shall be glad in his
   salvation. 10. All my bones shall say, O Jehovah! who is like thee,
   that deliverest the poor from him that is stronger than he, the poor
   and miserable from him that spoileth him?


   8. Let confusion of which he is not aware come upon him. David again
   prays that God would cause to return upon the head of his enemies the
   mischief which they had directed against a just and an inoffensive man.
   The change from the plural to the singular number, even when the same
   subject, is spoken of, is, we know, a thing very common among the
   Hebrews. Accordingly, what is here said of one man is applicable to all
   David's enemies in general, unless, perhaps, we are rather inclined to
   suppose that allusion is here made to Saul or some one of his nobles.
   But as it is certain that the prayer which he here offers against Saul
   as the head extends to the whole body, in other words, to all his
   followers, [707] it matters little in which way we understand it. The
   Hebrew word sv'h, shoah, sometimes signifies confusion, and sometimes
   destruction; and, therefore, many translate it, Let destruction, or
   desolation, or ruin, come upon him. The other rendering, however, seems
   more suitable, for he immediately adds, Let his own net which he hath
   hidden catch him, let him fall into it with confusion The way in which
   others render it, Let him fall into destruction itself, is certainly
   forced and unnatural. But the meaning of the clause will be brought out
   very suitable if it is viewed as a prayer of David, that as the wicked
   settle down like wine upon the lees, in present enjoyments, and fear
   nothing, as if they were placed beyond the reach of all danger, some
   calamity which they think not of may suddenly come upon them like a
   tempest, and overwhelm them. It never for a moment occurs to them as at
   all possible that their stratagems and craft, their wicked practices,
   and all the snares which they lay for the good and the simple, turn to
   the destruction of themselves who have devised them. David, therefore,
   very properly desires that they may fall with confusion into the nets
   which they have laid; in other words, that they may be filled with
   amazement and terror when they are suddenly and unexpectedly visited
   with calamity. The more unbounded and extravagant the exultation of men
   is, through their vainly and foolishly imagining that they shall escape
   unpunished, the more are they filled with amazement and fear when
   calamity suddenly overtakes them. I have, however, no doubt that David
   here refers to some strange and extraordinary calamity. Let confusion,
   then, of which he thinks not, come upon him; that is to say, when he
   shall have persuaded himself that all goes well with him, and promised
   himself peace in his deceitful fascinations, then let unwonted terror
   strike him to the heart, and let him feel by his tumultuous fear that
   he is caught in his own snares.

   9. And my soul is joyful in Jehovah. Others read this in the optative
   mood, May my soul rejoice in Jehovah, and may it be glad in his
   salvation But instead of continuing to express his desires, David, in
   my opinion, rather promises in this verse that he will be grateful to
   God. This is still more evident from the following verse, in which
   extolling very highly the goodness of God, he says that he will
   celebrate the remembrance of it with every member of his body. While,
   therefore, some ascribe to fortune, and others to their own skill, the
   praise of their deliverance from danger, and few, if any, yield the
   whole praise of it to God, David here declares that he will not forget
   the favor which God had bestowed upon him. My soul, says he, shall
   rejoice, not in a deliverance of the author of which it is ignorant,
   but in the salvation of God. To place the matter in a still stronger
   light, he assigns to his very bones the office of declaring the divine
   glory. As if not content that his tongue should be employed in this, he
   applies all the members of his body to the work of setting forth the
   praises of God. The style of speaking which he employs is hyperbolical,
   but in this way he shows unfeignedly that his love to God was so strong
   that he desired to spend his sinews and bones in declaring the reality
   and truth of his devotion.

   10. O Jehovah! who is like thee? Here he explains more fully the nature
   of his joy in the salvation of God of which he had spoken, showing that
   it consisted in his ascribing entirely to God the deliverance which he
   had obtained. Men, in general, praise God in such a manner that he
   scarcely obtains the tenth part of his due. But David, distinguishing
   him from all others, distinctly declares that the whole glory of his
   deliverance is due to him alone. And, certainly, we then only yield to
   God what belongs to him, when, investing him with his own power, we
   rest all our hopes on him. For what purpose does it serve, loudly to
   celebrate the name of God with our mouths, if we tear in pieces his
   power and goodness at our pleasure? David, therefore, in the true
   spirit of godliness, extols the greatness of God by this high encomium,
   that he is the guardian and defender of the poor, and rescues the needy
   and afflicted from the hand of those who oppress them; as if he had
   said, It is God's peculiar duty to succor the miserable. By these words
   we are taught to cling to the hope of better things in adversity; for
   the power and resources of our enemies, however great they may be, is
   no reason why we should lose our confidence, since God declares to us
   from heaven that he reigns expressly for the purpose of resisting the
   strong and powerful. If the children of this world, who employ their
   power in injuring and oppressing the weak, had the least degree of
   sound understanding, it would certainly serve to restrain their
   audacity, and prevent them proceeding farther in provoking the wrath of
   God.

   Psalm 35:11-15

   11. Violent witnesses rise up, they charge me with things which I know
   not. 12. They render me evil for good, to the bereaving [708] of my
   soul. 13. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was
   sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; and have poured my prayer
   into my own bosom. 14. I behaved myself towards him as if he had been
   my friend and brother: I humbled myself as one that mourneth heavily
   for his mother. 15. But they rejoiced at my halting, they gathered
   themselves together; yea, even the abjects whom I knew not gathered
   themselves against me: they have torn me with their lips, and have not
   ceased.


   11. Violent witnesses [709] rise up. The Hebrew is, they shall rise up;
   but in using the future tense, the Psalmist intimates that he is
   speaking of what he had suffered for a long time. And he complains that
   he was so oppressed with calumny that he had no opportunity of
   defending himself; than which nothing more grievous and painful can
   ever happen to those of an ingenuous mind, and who are conscious of no
   blame. Besides, he not only says that he had been falsely accused, but
   he also condemns the audacity and insolence of those who violently rose
   up to bear witness against him. To this belongs what he adds, They
   charge me with things which I know not. David then was not only spoiled
   of his worldly goods, and basely driven into exile, but was also
   accused and loaded with infamy under color of justice. Being involved
   in such distress, he resorted directly to God, hoping that he would
   maintain his innocence. So ought the children of God to walk through
   good report and bad report, and patiently suffer reproach, until he
   assert and declare their innocence from on high. In old times, it was a
   common proverb among the heathen, "There is no theater more beautiful
   than a good conscience;" and in this they uttered a noble sentiment;
   but no man can be sustained and supported by the purity of his
   conscience unless he has recourse to God.

   12. They render me evil for good. David again shows that the malice of
   his enemies was of a very aggravated character, because they not only
   oppressed him wrongfully, seeing he was innocent, and had given them no
   occasion of offense, but also because even those who had received much
   enjoyment and many favors from him, recompensed him in a very strange
   and ungrateful manner. Such disgraceful conduct wounds the feelings of
   good men very severely, and seems quite intolerable. But it is an
   inexpressibly great consolation when we can testify before God, that we
   have attempted by every means in our power to soothe the minds of our
   enemies, and to bow them to gentleness, although, notwithstanding, they
   are hurried on by insatiable cruelty in desiring our hurt; for God will
   not suffer this barbarous and brutal ingratitude to pass unpunished.
   Their cruelty is farther expressed when it is said that they endeavored
   to bereave (for so it is properly in the Hebrew [710] ) the soul of a
   meek and peaceable man; that is to say, to deprive it of comfort, and
   render it so desolate as to overwhelm it with despair and destroy it.
   David afterwards recounts certain acts of kindness which he had done
   them, and which, if they had had any sense of equity and humanity,
   ought to have been as so many sacred bonds of mutual love. He does not
   say that he aided them with money or with goods, or that he had by some
   other means exercised liberality towards them, for it may sometimes
   happen that when the hand is open the heart may be shut; but he
   mentions certain tokens of true and genuine love -- that he lamented
   their misfortunes before God, and was troubled for them, as if he had
   mourned for the death of his mother; and, finally, that he felt for and
   took an interest in them as if they had been his own brothers. Since
   then he had thus laid them under high obligations to him, of what baser
   ingratitude could they be guilty than to vomit against him in his
   adversity the poison of their hatred? With respect to the meaning of
   the words, I take the term sickness, in this place, to signify
   metaphorically any kind of trouble or sorrow. David's meaning is, that
   as often as any calamity had befallen them he was a partaker of their
   grief. A good evidence of this was the prayer which he says he poured
   out into his own bosom. The proper meaning of the expression is, that
   he did not ostentatiously utter his prayers aloud before men, like many
   who pretend much more affection than they really feel, but that by
   praying in secret, and without making the world privy to it, he showed
   that he was sincerely and from the heart distressed by reason of their
   affliction. As we say that a man rejoices in his own bosom, who is
   satisfied with the secret and inward feeling of his heart, without
   declaring it to others, so also one may be said to weep or pray in his
   own bosom, who pours not forth his tears and prayers before men to
   secure their favor, but, contented with having God alone for his
   witness, conceals his emotions in his own heart. I do not, however,
   deny that in this manner of speaking there is expressed the attitude of
   one who prays, as if the Psalmist had said, that he bowed down his
   body, and prayed with his head hanging down, and his arms folded, as
   men in heaviness are accustomed to do. [711] But this especially we
   ought to regard as his meaning, that there was no dissimulation in his
   prayer. Some think that there is an imprecation in his words, and they
   explain them in this sense. Lord, if it is true that I have not desired
   all prosperity to them, let all mischief fall upon me: but this is a
   forced explanation. There is still another exposition, which has as
   little plausibility in it; and it is this: Because I profited nothing
   by praying for them, the fruit of my prayer returned to myself. The
   sense, which is more in unison with the purpose and also the words of
   the prophet, is, I prayed for them just as I pray for myself. But what
   I have already advanced concerning the secret affection of the Psalmist
   will, I hope, prove satisfactory to the judicious reader. With respect
   to sackcloth and fasting, he used them as helps to prayer. The faithful
   pray even after their meals, and do not observe fasting every day as
   necessary for prayer, nor consider it needful to put on sackcloth
   whenever they come into the presence of God. But we know that those who
   lived in ancient times resorted to these exercises when any urgent
   necessity pressed upon them. In the time of public calamity or danger
   they all put on sackcloth, and gave themselves to fasting, that by
   humbling themselves before God, and acknowledging their guilt, they
   might appease his wrath. In like manner, when any one in particular was
   afflicted, in order to excite himself to greater earnestness in prayer,
   he put on sackcloth and engaged in fasting, as being the tokens of
   grief. When David then, as he here tells us, put on sackcloth, it was
   the same as if he had taken upon himself the sins of his enemies, in
   order to implore from God mercy for them, while they were exerting all
   their power to accomplish his destruction. Although we may reckon the
   wearing of sackcloth and sitting in ashes among the number of the legal
   ceremonies, yet the exercise of fasting remains in force amongst us at
   this day as well as in the time of David. When God, therefore, calls us
   to repentance, by showing us signs of his displeasure, let us bear in
   mind that we ought not only to pray to him after the ordinary manner,
   but also to employ such means as are fitted to promote our humility. In
   conclusion, the Psalmist says that he behaved and acted towards them as
   if each of them had been his brother.

   15. But they rejoiced at my halting. I see no reason why interpreters
   should trouble themselves as they do about the word halting. Some
   conjecture that David had his leg put out of joint, and others suppose
   that he halted from some disease. But when we consider carefully the
   whole passage, nothing is more evident than that he refers by this
   expression to the calamities which befell him; as if he had said, As
   soon as they saw me begin to stagger and ready to fall, they did as it
   were gather together against me, and endeavored entirely to overthrow
   me. There is, therefore, in this expression almost the same metaphor as
   we have already seen in the word sickness. Now, as men often relent at
   seeing the misfortunes of their enemies, so that they cease to hate or
   persecute those who are already miserably wretched, it was an evidence
   of the very cruel and fierce spirit by which David's former friends
   were actuated against him, when, upon seeing him cast down and
   afflicted, they were rather by this incited furiously and insolently to
   assail him. At the commencement he speaks only of a few; but
   immediately after, in order to show still farther the indignity which
   had been done to him, he adds to them the base and ignoble of the
   common people; not that he blames all alike, but that he may the better
   show with what bitter hostility he was assailed on all sides. It is
   probable that those who were then in power were as it were firebrands,
   who endeavored to kindle every where the flame of hatred against David,
   that the people every where might rise up to destroy him, and strive
   with each other in this enterprise. And he repeats twice that they
   gathered themselves together, in order to show how resolute and
   determined they were in their opposition to him; unless, perhaps, some
   would prefer to explain the words thus: They gathered themselves
   together, not only those who had some pretext for doing so, but even
   the lowest of the people. The Hebrew word nkym, nekim, literally
   signifies the whipped, or beaten, [712] but it is here to be understood
   as denoting base and disreputable persons. Some interpreters, indeed,
   derive it from the word k'h, kaäh, which signifies to make sad, and
   expound it actively, Those who make me sad: but the previous
   interpretation agrees better with the design of the passage, namely,
   that David was shamefully treated by the lowest dregs of the people.
   The words, I knew not, may be referred to the cause as well as to the
   persons. I, however, explain it as referring to the persons in this
   sense: So far from having any cause to complain that I have offended
   them, or done them any harm, I did not even know them. At the same
   time, these words may be understood as implying a complaint on the part
   of David, that the people were enraged against him without any cause,
   since he is conscious of no crime, and can conceive of no ground for
   such fierce hatred towards him. As to the last clause of the verse,
   also, although interpreters entertain different opinions, it appears to
   me that I have given the true and natural meaning. Literally it is,
   they did cut, and ceased not; but there can be no doubt that the
   language is metaphorical, and that the word cut [713] signifies that
   they opened their mouth; as if David had said, They have insolently
   poured forth with open mouth their scoffing and reproachful words
   against me. The additional clause in the sentence, and ceased not, is a
   repetition common in the Hebrew language, and is employed to express
   the vehemence with which David's enemies proceeded against him. It
   implies that there was no end or measure to their evil-speaking, and
   that they continued to pour forth with distended throats whatever first
   occurred to them.

   that the LXX., in translating it scourges, alluded to the scourge of
   the tongue, as in Job 5:21; and if smiters is the proper rendering, we
   may certainly conclude, that as this smiting is represented as done
   upon the person who was its object in his absence, it was a smiting by
   the tongue. At the same time, this critic observes, that the word may
   be read the smitten, that is, abjects, vile persons, as in Job 30:8 Dr

   Another meaning of the word, according to Buxtorff, is, the wry-legged,

   the epithet of Necho was given to one of the Pharaohs, who halted in
   his gait. Thus it easily came to be employed as a term of contempt.

   Psalm 35:16-18

   16. Among perfidious jesters at feasts, they gnash upon me with their
   teeth. 17. O Lord! [714] how long wilt thou look on? deliver my soul
   from their tumults, and my only one [715] from the lions. 18. I will
   magnify thee in the great congregation: [716] I will praise thee before
   a great people. [717]


   16. Among perfidious jesters. Others translate it, With hypocrites, but
   in my opinion David simply relates the combination of his enemies. And
   the meaning of the expression is to this effect, That among men of a
   crafty disposition, who had been addicted to deceit, and were
   consequently lost to all sense of shame, the only and the constant
   subject of their deliberations was, how they might destroy this
   afflicted man. David again reverts to the leaders of the people, and to
   those in power, as the source whence all the mischief took its rise;
   for this description could not apply to a great part of the common
   people, who acted rather by thoughtless impulse. He therefore speaks
   particularly of the rulers, and others of a similar character, and
   accuses them of cruelty, saying, that they gnash their teeth upon him
   like furious wild beasts. He first calls them perfidious or wicked,
   that he may the more easily obtain help and aid of God, as if calling
   upon him in the extremity of distress; and, secondly, he calls them
   jesters or mockers, by which he means that they have such effrontery,
   and are so far lost to all sense of shame, that there is nothing which
   they will not dare to do. As to the meaning of the word mvg, maog,
   which follows, interpreters are not agreed. Properly, it signifies
   bread baked upon the hearth upon the embers. Some, however, because
   they could not elicit from it a meaning suitable to the passage, have
   thought that it should be taken for talkative jesting, or idle speech.
   Others, presuming to give a still wider range to their fancy, have
   supposed the meaning of the Psalmist to be, that the scoffing of such
   persons was as bread to them, because they take pleasure in scoffing
   and jesting. To me, it appears that we ought to retain the proper
   signification of the word, while, at the same time, it may be
   understood in a twofold sense. Some taking mvg, maog, for a cake or
   tart, are of opinion that David here censures people of a delicate
   taste, who seek after fine and dainty fare, many of whom are always to
   be found in the courts of princes. Others rather suppose that he
   rebukes persons of a servile and sordid spirit, who, for the most
   trifling consideration, would employ their tongues in reviling others,
   just as in all ages there have been found men who, for a bit of bread,
   as we say, set their tongues to sale. When I carefully consider other
   passages in which David describes the nature and character of his
   enemies, I am disposed to think that those who indulged in jesting and
   scoffing at feasts, and who, in sitting over their cups, consulted
   about putting David to death, are here referred to. He therefore
   complains, that even in the midst of their feasting and banqueting, the
   ungodly, who had shaken off all shame, communed how they might take
   away his life.

   17. O Lord! how long wilt thou look on? The meaning of the word which I
   have translated how long, is ambiguous in the Hebrew. In Latin it
   signifies, How long wilt thou see it, and suffer it without uttering a
   word? But the other interpretation is equally appropriate, namely,
   After having seemed to take no notice of the matter for a long time,
   when wilt thou at length begin to see it? The meaning, however, is
   substantially the same, for David complains of God's long forbearance,
   declaring that while the wicked are running to every excess, God
   connives at them, and delays too much to take vengeance. And although
   God inculcates upon the faithful the duty of quietly and patiently
   waiting till the time arrive when he shall judge it proper to help
   them, yet he allows them to bewail in prayer the grief which they
   experience on account of his delay. At the same time, David shows, that
   in so speaking he is not carried headlong merely by the importunity of
   his desire, but that he is constrained to it by the extremity of his
   distress. For he says that they tumultuously rush upon him to take away
   his life, and he compares them to lions, and calls his soul solitary,
   or alone. Some think that the expression, only soul, means clear and
   precious, or well beloved; but such do not sufficiently consider the
   design of David, as has been stated in the 22nd Psalm at the
   twenty-first verse.

   18. I will magnify thee in the great congregation. In this verse David
   again engages to give thanks to God for all his goodness, since the
   faithful can render him no other recompense than the sacrifice of
   praise, as we shall see in Psalm 116:17. Thus even whilst he was
   surrounded by the impetuous billows of fear and danger, he sets himself
   to the exercise of giving thanks, as if he had already obtained his
   desire; and by this he intended to encourage and confirm himself in the
   assurance of obtaining his requests. In this we may discern a striking
   and decided evidence of invincible fortitude, for though an outcast and
   a fugitive, destitute of all help, and, in short, in a state of great
   extremity and despair as to all his affairs, yet still he thinks of
   praising God's grace, and makes vows of solemn sacrifice to him, as if,
   in the midst of the darkness of death, he saw deliverance clearly
   shining upon him. And he speaks not only of giving thanks in private,
   but of such thanksgiving as those who were delivered out of any great
   perils were wont to yield in the public assembly, by the appointment of
   the law. Some translate the latter clause of the verse a strong and
   powerful people, [718] but I do not see the propriety of it. It is a
   mere subtilty to argue that the Church is endued with great strength,
   and therefore is called a strong people. But as David simply means the
   great crowd and multitude of people who were wont to go up to the
   sanctuary to hold their solemn assembly before God, I have no doubt
   that when he speaks of the great congregation, and afterwards of much
   people, he only repeats, according to his custom, the same thing twice,
   for the Hebrew word is used in both these senses.

   Psalm 35:19-23

   19. Let not those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
   neither let those who hate me without a cause wink with the eye. 20.
   For they speak not peace; [719] but devise deceitful words upon the
   clefts of the earth. 21. They have opened their mouth against me: they
   have said, Aha! aha! our eye hath seen it. [720] 22. O Jehovah! thou
   hast also seen it: keep not silence: O Lord! be not far from me. 23.
   Stir up thyself, and awake for my judgment, O my God! even for my
   cause, O my Lord!


   19. Let not those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me.
   Because David's enemies already exulted in the hope of seeing his
   overthrow and destruction, he prays that God would not suffer them to
   realize a desire so wicked. In order to render God favorable to his
   cause, he again protests that they hated him without any fault or
   occasion on his part, and that it was their own malice which urged them
   to such cruelty against him; for in order to secure the help of God, it
   is necessary to come before him with the testimony of a good
   conscience.

   The Hebrew word sqr, sheker, which we have rendered wrongfully, is by
   some translated deceitfully, as if David meant that his enemies lay in
   wait for him. But this is to reason with too much subtilty. Besides,
   the repetition which immediately follows shows that he complains of
   their wilful hatred, inasmuch as of their own accord, and from
   deliberate design, they persecuted a man who had given them no cause of
   offense, but was their friend and benefactor. The Hebrew word qrph,
   karats, here signifies to wink with the eyes askance in mockery, as in
   Psalm 22:8, it denotes, to wag the head, and to shoot out the lip.

   In the following verse, that he may cherish still greater confidence in
   God, David again declares, that he has to do with enemies of an
   irreconcilable character, and who are fully bent upon cruelty. Of this
   we ought to be firmly persuaded, that the more grievously we are
   oppressed, so much the more certainly ought we to expect deliverance.
   He therefore says, that they speak of nothing but of tumults and
   slaughter. The meaning of the latter clause is somewhat obscure,
   arising from the ambiguous signification of the word rg, rige. As the
   word from which it is derived sometimes signifies to cut, and sometimes
   to rest, or to be quiet and peaceable, there are some who translate it
   the meek and peaceable of the earth: others translate it, with the
   tranquil and easy of the earth; meaning by this, those who live in the
   midst of riches and abundance, in the enjoyment of undisturbed repose.
   Both these seem to me to be forced interpretations. Others, too, though
   not more correctly, expound the word in caves or secret places, in
   order that, as they say, the wicked and deceitful counsels of such
   persons may not come to light. But it may be very appropriately
   rendered, the clefts of the earth, and by this metaphor are meant the
   miserable and afflicted, who are, as it were, broken and maimed. David,
   therefore, declares that as soon as his enemies see any opening, that
   is to say, some calamity befall him, they instantly put forth all their
   efforts to accomplish his destruction. Those who, in the time of his
   prosperity and power, never dared even to utter a word against him,
   began now, when they saw that his influence was feeble, to plot his
   ruin, just as we know that the wicked are for the most part persons of
   a servile and cowardly disposition, and assume not the tone of
   insolence save when an advantageous opportunity presents itself, as
   when the good and simple are in adversity. To the same purpose he
   represents them in the next verse, as crying out with open mouth, Aha!
   aha! and clapping their hands for joy that they saw David overcome,
   and, as it were, laid prostrate in the dust, a spectacle in which they
   took great delight.

   22. O Jehovah! thou hast also seen it. There is in these words an
   implied contrast between the view which God is here represented as
   taking, and the sight at which, as we are told in the preceding verse,
   the ungodly rejoiced. The import of David's language is, You have
   rejoiced exceedingly at the sight of my miseries; but God also sees and
   takes notice of the cruelty and malice of those who feel a pleasure and
   gratification in seeing others afflicted and in trouble. David,
   however, in thus speaking, stays not to reason with his enemies, but
   rather addresses himself directly to God, and sets his providence as a
   rampart of defense in opposition to all the assaults of those who
   sought to shake his confidence, and who caused him much trouble. And
   certainly, if we would fortify ourselves against the scoffing and
   derision of our enemies, the best means which we can employ for this
   end is to overlook them, and to elevate our thoughts to God, and in the
   confidence of his fatherly care over us, to entreat him to show, in
   very deed, that our troubles are not unknown to him; yea, that the more
   he sees the wicked eagerly watching every opportunity to accomplish our
   ruin, he would the more speedily come to our aid. This David expresses
   by these various forms of expression -- Keep not silence, be not far
   from me, stir up thyself, awake for my judgment He might justly make
   use of such expressions, seeing he was already fully persuaded that God
   regards the poor and afflicted, and marks all the wrongs which are done
   to them. If, therefore, we would frame our requests aright, a clear
   conviction and persuasion of the providence of God must first shine
   into our hearts; nor is it necessary only that this should precede, in
   point of order, all our desires; it must also restrain and govern them.

   Psalm 35:24-28

   24. Judge me, O Jehovah my God! According to thy righteousness; and let
   them not rejoice over me. 25. Let them not say in their heart, Aha! our
   soul! [721] let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 26. Let those
   who rejoice at my hurt be ashamed and confounded together; let those
   who magnify themselves against me be clothed with shame and dishonor.
   27. But let those who favor my righteous cause shout and be glad, and
   let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, who loveth the peace of
   his servant. 28. And my tongue shall declare thy righteousness and thy
   praise all the day.


   24. Judge me, O Jehovah my God! David here confirms the prayer of the
   preceding verse that God would be his defender, and would maintain his
   righteous cause. Having been for a time subjected to suffering as one
   who had been forsaken and forgotten, he sets before himself the
   righteousness of God, which forbids that he should altogether abandon
   the upright and the just. It is, therefore, not simply a prayer, but a
   solemn appeal to God, that as he is righteous, he would manifest his
   righteousness in defending his servant in a good cause. And certainly,
   when we seem to be forsaken and deprived of all help, there is no
   remedy which we can employ, more effectual to overcome temptation than
   this consideration, that the righteousness of God, on which our
   deliverance depends, can never fail. Accordingly, the Apostle Paul, in
   exhorting the faithful to patience, says in 2 Thessalonians 1:6,

   "It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
   to them that trouble you."

   Now David again appeals to God in this place, and entreats him to
   manifest his righteousness in restraining the insolence of his enemies:
   for the more proudly they assail us, God is so much the more ready to
   help us. Besides, by again introducing them as speaking, he portrays in
   a graphic style the cruelty of their desires; and by this he means to
   show, that if things should happen according to their wishes, they
   would set no limit to their frowardness. But as the more they vaunt
   themselves, the more they provoke the wrath of God against them, David
   with good reason uses this as an argument to encourage his hope, and
   employs it for his support and confirmation in prayer.

   26. Let those who rejoice at thy hurt be ashamed and confounded
   together. This imprecation has already been expounded; and it is only
   necessary to remark, that there is peculiar force in the expression,
   together, or at once. It shows that it was not only one or two, but a
   great multitude, who waged war against him, and that he yielded not to
   the influence of fear, but believed that as soon as God should lift up
   his hand, he could at one stroke easily overthrow them all. When it is
   said that they seek after and rejoice in David's hurt, this shows that
   they were filled with cruel hatred against him. And when it is said,
   that they magnify themselves against him, this is a token of pride.
   David, therefore, in order to render them more hateful in the sight of
   God, represents them as filled with pride and cruelty. And as this form
   of prayer was dictated by the Holy Spirit to David, there can be no
   doubt that the end of all the proud shall be such as is here predicted,
   that they shall turn back overwhelmed with shame and disgrace.

   27. Let those who favor my righteous cause rejoice and be glad. These
   two expressions, which are rendered in the optative mood, might have
   been translated with equal propriety in the future tense; but as this
   is a matter of little consequence, I leave it undecided. David here
   extols the deliverance which he asks of God, and exults in the results
   which should flow from it; namely, that it would be an occasion of
   general rejoicing and good hope to all the godly, while at the same
   time it would stir them up to celebrate the praises of God. He
   attributes to all the faithful the credit of desiring, that as an
   innocent man his righteous cause should be maintained. David, it is
   true, was the object of almost universal hatred among the simple and
   unsuspecting, who were imposed upon by false and unjust reports made
   concerning him; but it is certain that there were among the people some
   who formed a just and impartial estimate of things, and who were sorely
   grieved that a holy man, and one too whose benevolence was well known,
   should have been so unjustly and so wrongfully oppressed. And surely
   the common feelings of humanity require, that when we see men unjustly
   oppressed and afflicted, if we are not able to help them, we should at
   least pity them. When David uses the language, Jehovah be magnified,
   his design seems to be tacitly to set this in opposition to the pride
   of the wicked, of which he made mention above. As they presume in the
   pride, of their hearts, and by their insolent and overbearing conduct,
   to obscure, as far as in them lies, the divine glory, so may the
   faithful, on the other hand, with good reason present the prayer that
   God would shine forth in the majesty of his character, and demonstrate
   in very deed that he exercises a special care over all his servants,
   and takes a peculiar pleasure in their peace. Finally, the Psalmist
   again declares, in the conclusion of the psalm, his resolution to
   celebrate in appropriate praises the righteousness of God, by which he
   had been preserved and delivered.

   [721] "C'est, nostre desire nous avons ce que desirions: ou, nostre
   ame, assavoir s'esjouisse, comme on dit en nostre langue, Grande
   chere." -- Note, Fr. marg. "That is, our desire -- we have what we
   desire: or, our soul, that is to say, is glad: as we say in our
   language, Great cheer." French and Skinner read, "Let them not say in
   their hearts, Aha! our desire!" and observe, "that our desire! means
   our desire is accomplished."
