PREFACE

   Not long after my edition of this Father's writings appeared in the
   Cambridge Patristic Texts (1904), I was invited to translate the
   Letters and some of the other more certainly genuine fragments that
   remain into English for the present series; but it is not until now
   that I have been able to accomplish the task I then undertook. Since
   then, though chiefly occupied in other researches, I have naturally
   acquired a more extensive and accurate knowledge of St. Dionysius and
   his times, some of the results of which will be found in this volume.
   Nevertheless, I was bound to incorporate a considerable amount of the
   information and conclusions arrived at in the former work, and wish to
   express my acknowledgments to the Syndics of the University Press for
   leave to do so, as well as to those again whose names I mentioned as
   having assisted me before.

   In the present book Dr. A. J. Mason was kind enough to advise me over
   the choice of extracts from the two treatises, On Nature and Refutation
   and Defence, and on one or two minor points, while a friend and
   neighbour (the Rev. L. Patterson) read through the whole of the MS.
   before it went to the printer and gave me the benefit of a fresh mind
   upon a number of small details of style and fact, for which I sincerely
   thank him.

INTRODUCTION

   1. None of the many influential occupants of the see of Alexandria and
   of the many distinguished heads of the Catechetical School in that city
   seem to have been held in higher respect by the ancients than
   Dionysius. By common consent he is styled "the Great," while
   Athanasius, one of his most famous-successors as Bishop, calls him
   "Teacher of the Church universal," and Basil (of Cæsarea) refers to him
   as "a person of canonical authority" (kanonikos). He took a prominent
   and important part in all the leading movements and controversies of
   the day, and his opinions always carried great weight, especially in
   Eastern Christendom. His writings are freely referred to and quoted,
   not only by Eusebius the historian, [1] but also by Athanasius, Basil
   and John of Damascus amongst others. And what we gather of his personal
   story from his letters and various fragments embodied in the works of
   others--and very little, if anything else, for certain has come down to
   us--undoubtedly leaves the impression that the verdict of the ancient
   world is correct.
     __________________________________________________________________

  His Family and Earlier Life

   2. The references to his family and early years are extremely scanty
   and vague. In the Chronicon Orientale, p. 94, he is stated to have been
   a Sabaita and sprung from "the chiefs and nobles of that race": and
   several writers speak as if he had been a rhetorician before his
   conversion (as Cyprian of Carthage had been). The exact meaning of the
   term "Sabaita" above is doubtful. Strictly used, it should mean a
   member of the Sabaite convent near Jerusalem, and the Chronicon may be
   claiming Dionysius as that, though, of course, without any ground for
   the claim. If it is equivalent, however, to "Sabæan" here, it implies
   an Arab descent for him, which is hardly probable, as he seems always
   to consider himself connected by education and residence, if not by
   birth, with the city-folk of Alexandria, whom he distinguishes from the
   Coptic inhabitants of Egypt (Aiguptioi); so that it would be rather
   surprising to find that his family came from the remoter parts of
   Arabia, where the Sabæans dwelt. The other tradition of his having been
   a rhetorician may be due to some confusion between our Dionysius and a
   much later Alexandrian writer of the same name, who edited the works of
   the Areopagite with notes and wrote other treatises. On the other hand,
   Dionysius's literary style is such that it might very well have been
   formed by the study and practice of rhetoric, while he has been thought
   himself to corroborate the statement of the Chronicon Orientale, as to
   the high position of his family, in his reply to Germanus ([10]p. 49),
   where he refers to the "losses of dignities" which he has suffered for
   the Faith.

   3. He was probably a priest, and not less than thirty, when he became
   head of the Catechetical School in 231, and in 264 he excused himself
   from attendance at the Council of Antioch on the ground of age and
   infirmity; and so it is a safe inference that he was born about or
   before 200, being thus nearly of an age with Cyprian of Carthage, and
   only ten or fifteen years younger than Origen, his master.
     __________________________________________________________________

  His Conversion

   4. The Chronicon Orientale assigns the reading of St. Paul's letters as
   the cause of his conversion to Christianity, and proceeds to state how,
   after their perusal, he presented himself for baptism to Demetrius,
   then Bishop of Alexandria, who admitted him in due course. Whether this
   was actually the cause of his conversion or not, we know from what he
   has himself told us in his letter to Philemon ([11]p. 56), that both
   before and after baptism he was a diligent student of all that was
   written for and against Christianity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Was He Married or Not?

   5. Whether, in accordance with the common practice of the Eastern
   Church at that time, Dionysius was married or not, is a moot point. He
   addressed his treatise peri Phuseos to one Timotheus ho pais, and we
   read of hoi paides (of whom Timotheus was one) as accompanying him in
   his flight ([12]p. 44). One would naturally infer from this that he was
   then a widower (his wife not being mentioned), and that these were his
   sons; but they may have been his pupils, on the supposition that he was
   still Catechete as well as Bishop, or, which is less likely, his
   servants. [2]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] Most of those who read this will be aware that pais (Lat. puer) can
   be used in various senses, like our "boy" and French garçon.
     __________________________________________________________________

  He becomes Head of the Catechetical School

   6. When Demetrius died in 231, Heraclas, who for some years had been
   associated with Origen at the Catechetical School and had just been
   left in charge of it by him on his final retirement that year from
   Alexandria, was elected Bishop, while Dionysius, who had himself been a
   pupil of Origen there, was appointed to fill the vacancy he created. It
   is possible that the treatise peri Phuseos, extracts from which are
   given below (on [13]pp. 91 ff.), was composed while Dionysius held this
   important post, and that a commentary on Ecclesiastes, some genuine
   fragments of which probably remain, belongs to the same period. The
   former of these is much the more valuable work, for in it for the first
   time a Christian undertook systematically to refute the atomistic
   theories of Epicurus and his followers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  He becomes Bishop of Alexandria

   7. Sixteen years later, in 247, upon the death of Heraclas, Dionysius
   succeeded to the bishopric as the fourteenth occupant of the see,
   possibly, as has already been suggested, without at once resigning his
   post at the School. Philip the Arabian (of Bostra) had then been
   Emperor for three years, a position he was destined to retain for two
   years longer. Like Alexander Severus before him, he was known to favour
   the Christians, and Dionysius himself bears witness to the comparative
   mildness of his rule ([14]p. 37). For a short time, therefore, the new
   Bishop and his flock were left in peace, though even before the death
   of Philip signs of the coming storm appeared. In the last year of his
   reign Dionysius tells Fabius, Bishop of Antioch ([15]p. 35), that "the
   prophet and poet of evil to this city, whoever he was," stirred up the
   populace against the Christians in Alexandria, and several persons were
   cruelly martyred. This reign of terror lasted some time, but was
   interrupted in the autumn of 249 by the revolution which caused the
   deposition and death of Philip, and which set Decius on the throne in
   his stead. The respite was only too brief, for by the beginning of the
   new year the edict which Decius had issued was being actively carried
   into effect. The Bishops were at first singled out for attack. Origen,
   though not one of them, was included among the earlier victims--on
   account, no doubt, of his prominence as a scholar and a teacher--being
   imprisoned at Tyre and cruelly tortured, though not actually martyred.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Under the Persecution of Decius

   8. Decius's reversal of his predecessor's policy towards the Christians
   was probably due to reasons of state and expediency rather than, as
   Eusebius implies, to mere spite and hatred of Philip and all his ways.
   Anyhow, the severity of the Decian persecution is undoubted, and it
   fell with great force upon the Church at Alexandria. The Prefect of
   Egypt, Sabinus, lost no time in attacking Dionysius and his followers.
   Many endured tortures or death, or both. Dionysius himself, after
   waiting four days, fled and was sought for by a secret service
   messenger (frumentarius, see [16]note on p. 43) sent by Sabinus. A
   brief search was sufficient to recover him, and he was carried off with
   four of his companions to Taposiris. But through a strange
   interposition of Providence (related on [17]pp. 44 f.) he was rescued
   by a wedding party of rustic revellers and removed to a place of safety
   in the Libyan Desert, where he appears to have been left unmolested,
   with two of his four companions (see [18]pp. 64 ff.), till the
   persecution ceased and he was able to return to the city. In after days
   Dionysius's action in fleeing on this occasion was violently attacked
   by a certain Bishop Germanus, who was perhaps one of his suffragans.
   Germanus boasted of his own much braver conduct under persecution.
   Dionysius in his reply (see especially pp. [19]43 and [20]45) maintains
   that it was not of his own will nor yet without divine intimation that
   he had fled, and that he had suffered far more than his critic for the
   Faith. Decius's rule was brought to a calamitous end in 251, but
   Gallus, who succeeded him, continued his treatment of the Christians
   for another two years, when he, too, suffered an untimely fate.

   9. For the next four years the Church of Alexandria enjoyed comparative
   rest and peace. In 253 Æmilianus [3] the Governor of Pannonia and
   Moesia, who had in that spring wrested the imperial power from Gallus,
   was in his turn, after four months' rule, defeated by Valerian and his
   son Gallienus, and slain by the soldiery. The new Emperors (father and
   son) left the Christians alone during the first four years of their
   reign--a somewhat surprising fact, when it is considered that Valerian
   had been specially chosen to fill the office of "Censor," which Decius
   had revived. It may in some measure have been due to what Archbishop
   Benson (Cyprian, p. 457) calls his "languid temperament" as well as to
   his son's connexions with the Christians through his wife Cornelia
   Salonina.

     __________________________________________________________________

  His Action about Heretical Baptism

   10. During this interval of peace, but chiefly towards the end of it,
   Dionysius took part in that controversy about heretical baptism to
   which the letters on [21]pp. 51 ff. belong. Up till now various parts
   of Christendom had followed various customs on this matter without much
   disputing. In Asia Minor and in Africa baptism by heretics was not
   recognized, while in the West baptism with water in the name of the
   Trinity or of Christ was held valid by whomsoever performed. Before the
   middle of the third century, however, the difference of practice
   gradually became more and more a matter of controversy. In or about
   A.D. 230 two synods were held one after the other at Iconium and at
   Synnada (see [22]p. 58, n.), which confirmed the opinion that heretical
   baptism was invalid: and some twenty-five years later on Cyprian of
   Carthage convened several synods in North Africa, which arrived at the
   same conclusion. Thereupon a violent quarrel arose between Cyprian and
   Stephen the Bishop of Rome; this became, perhaps, all the keener,
   because of the former alliance and co-operation between Cyprian and
   Stephen's predecessor, Cornelius, in combating the Novatianist schism,
   [4] which had eventually led also to heresy over the restoration of
   those who had lapsed under persecution. Severe language was now used on
   both sides, and other leading Churchmen of the day were naturally drawn
   into the discussion: among them our Dionysius, who--after the first, at
   all events--with characteristic sagacity steered a middle course and
   advised that the older spirit of toleration should be maintained, the
   circumstances of different churches requiring different methods.
   Fragments of five letters on this subject have come down to us, all
   addressed to the Church of Rome or rather to representative members of
   that Church, the first of them probably written in 254 when the
   Novatianist schism was subsiding ([23]see p. 52), and the others
   belonging to the year 257 ([24]see pp. 54 ff.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] For Dionysius's share in this dispute see his letter on p. 50.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Under the Persecution of Valerian

   11. Suddenly, in the summer of that year, the Church was startled by
   the issue of an edict which revived the reign of terror and threw her
   into a state of persecution which lasted for more than three years.
   This unexpected change of treatment is attributed by Dionysius to the
   influence of Macrianus, who at one time held the office of Rationalis
   (Treasurer or Accountant-General) to the Emperor. This man was
   apparently a cripple in body, but mentally and otherwise a person of
   considerable ability and force of character: but he seems to have
   associated himself in some way with the soothsayers of Egypt, [5] and
   to have conceived a violent hatred against the Christians. Quite early
   in the proceedings which were instituted against them at Alexandria in
   consequence of the edict, Dionysius, with several of his clergy, was
   brought before Æmilianus the Prefect, [6] and after
   examination--chiefly as to his loyalty to the Emperors, which his
   refusal to pay them divine honours rendered doubtful--was banished
   first to a place called Cephro (probably not far from Taposiris, where
   he had been sent before), and then somewhere on the high road in the
   district called Colluthion. Dionysius's own account of the
   circumstances which led to and attended this second exile is given on
   [25]pp. 46 ff., an account which is valuable, among other reasons,
   because it is largely drawn from the official memoranda of the
   Prefect's court, and because it shows how both sides did their
   ineffectual best to understand each other's position.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] Dionysius's phrase about him on p. 66 is "tutor and chief ruler of
   Egyptian magicians"; see note 3 in loco.

   [6] This Æmilianus was one of several who afterwards attempted to seize
   the throne; see above, p. 14. Macrianus was another of them in Egypt
   (p. 68, n.).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Restoration of Peace

   12. The persecution lasted till the autumn of 260, and was then, on the
   disappearance of Valerian, stayed by an edict of Peace issued by his
   son Gallienus, who was now left alone upon the throne. The Greek
   version, which Eusebius gives us, is apparently not that of the actual
   edict, but of the Emperor's letter or rescript which applied it to
   Egypt. It is addressed to Dionysius and other bishops, and runs as
   follows: "I have ordained that the benefit of my concession be enforced
   throughout the world, to the effect that men should withdraw from (i.
   e. not interfere with) your places of worship. And accordingly ye, too,
   may use the terms of my rescript, so that none may interfere with you.
   And this, which may with authority be carried out by you, has already
   been granted by me some time ago. And accordingly Aurelius Quirinius,
   who is in charge of the Exchequer, [7] shall preserve this form now
   given by me." Instructions were also issued permitting the Christians
   to have free access to their cemeteries--a privilege which was always
   much prized.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] The office indicated seems to be the same as that of Rationalis
   mentioned above on p. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

  His Return to Alexandria

   13. It is practically certain that Dionysius returned to Alexandria as
   soon as Gallienus's edict came into operation there. But almost
   immediately fresh disturbances were felt in the city, followed by one
   of those frequent outbreaks of pestilence to which the East was always
   liable, and these hindered for a time his work of bringing the brethren
   together again. The disturbances are with good reason thought to have
   been those connected with the attempt of Macrianus to overturn the
   power of Gallienus in Egypt, though that country was so often the scene
   of tumults and civil wars for the next twelve years and more that it is
   almost impossible to identify any particular disturbances with
   certainty during this period.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Troubles Connected with his Protest against Sabellianism

   14. For another five years Dionysius was spared to administer his
   charge and to benefit the Church at large with his prudent counsels.
   But, though attacks upon himself never seem to have troubled him very
   much, he had still to endure one such attack which probably grieved him
   more than all the rest, and the after results of which lingered on till
   the days of Athanasius and Basil in the next century. This was in
   connexion with the Sabellian controversy, especially that phase of it
   which had recently arisen in the Libyan Pentapolis (on the north-west
   coast of Cyrenaica). Sabellius was a native of the district, and his
   heresy consisted in laying too much stress on the unity of the Godhead
   and in so hopelessly confounding the Three Persons in the Trinity as to
   imply that the Person of the Father was incarnate in Christ. It is in
   257 that we first find Dionysius, in a letter to Xystus II ([26]see p.
   55), calling the attention of the Bishop of Rome to these views, by
   which time Sabellius was himself probably already dead. From what he
   says there, it appears as if Dionysius was unaware that these views
   were not of quite recent origin and were already rather prevalent in
   both East and West, whilst his words seem also to imply that this later
   phase of Sabellianism endangered the dignity of the Third Person as
   well as of the First and Second. In Libya the heresy gained such a hold
   upon the Church that it even infected certain of the Bishops, and the
   Son of God was no longer preached. Dionysius, therefore, feeling his
   responsibility for the churches under his care, became active in trying
   to eradicate the evil. Among a number of letters which he wrote on the
   subject, there was one (about the year 260) in which he made use of
   certain expressions and illustrations with regard to the Son of God,
   which were seized hold of by some members of the Church either at
   Alexandria or in the Pentapolis as heretical. This letter was
   apparently one of the later letters of the series, when his earlier
   overtures had failed to produce the effect he desired.

   15. Dionysius's critics laid a formal complaint against him before his
   namesake (Dionysius), who had by now succeeded the martyred Xystus II
   as Bishop of Rome; they accused him of having fallen into five errors
   himself, while correcting the false views of the Sabellians.

   They were as follows, as we gather them from Athan., de sent. Dion.:--

     (1) Separating the Father and the Son.

     (2) Denying the eternity of the Son.

     (3) Naming the Father without the Son and the Son without the
     Father.

     (4) Virtually rejecting the term homoousios (of one substance) as
     descriptive of the Son.

     (5) Speaking of the Son as a creature of the Father and using
     misleading illustrations of their relation to One Another.

   One or two of these illustrations which were objected to will be found
   in the extract translated on [27]p. 103, and they are sufficient to
   give some idea of the rest. It may, however, be acknowledged that
   neither Dionysius himself in his original statements and in his
   attempts to explain them, nor Athanasius, who, when Arius afterwards
   appealed to Dionysius in support of his opinions, put forward an
   elaborate defence of him, was altogether happy or successful.

   16. Upon receiving the complaint mentioned, the Bishop of Rome appears
   to have convened a synod, which condemned the expressions complained
   of, and a letter was addressed by him on the modes of correcting the
   heresy to the Church of Alexandria. From motives of delicacy he made no
   actual mention of his Alexandrian brother-bishop in this letter, while
   criticizing his views, though he wrote to him privately asking for an
   explanation. A considerable portion of the public letter has been
   preserved for us by Athanasius, but it is not included in this volume,
   nor is it necessary to particularize his treatment of the question or
   to say more than this, that, though the Roman Bishop wrote quite good
   Greek and gives no impression that he felt hampered by it in expressing
   his meaning, yet he does naturally exhibit distinct traces of Western
   modes of thought as opposed to Eastern, and is not always quite fair in
   his representation and interpretation of what Dionysius had said.

   Dionysius's answer to his Roman brother was embodied in the treatise
   called Refutation and Defence (Elenchos kai Apologia), some extracts
   from which (as given by Athanasius) will be found on [28]pp. 101 ff.

   The following is an indication of Dionysius's line of defence against
   the five points raised against him, other matters which arose more
   particularly between him and his namesake of Rome being passed over.

   (1) As to the charge of separating the Three Persons in the Trinity, he
   distinctly denies it: all the language he employs and the very names he
   gives imply the opposite: "Father" must involve "Son" and "Son"
   "Father": "Holy Spirit" at once suggests His Source and the Channel.

   (2) As to the eternity of the Son, he is equally emphatic. God was
   always the Father and therefore Christ was always the Son, just as, if
   the sun were eternal, the daylight would also be eternal.

   (3) The charge of omitting the Son in speaking of the Father and vice
   versa is refuted by what is said under (1): the one name involves the
   other.

   (4) Dionysius's rejection or non-employment of the term homoousios is
   less easily disposed of. He practically acknowledges that, as it is not
   a Scriptural word, he had not used it, but at the same time that the
   figures he employed suggested a similar relationship, e. g. the figure
   of parent and child who are of one family (homogeneis) or seed, root
   and plant which are of one kind (homophue), and again source and
   stream, and in another place the word in the heart and the mind
   springing forth by the tongue (see [29]p. 106): but for the
   unsatisfactoriness of this defence the reader should consult
   Bethune-Baker, Early History of Christian Doctrine, chap. viii. pp. 113
   ff, who points out that Dionysius had not grasped the Western tradition
   of one substantia (ousia) of Godhead existing in three Persons.

   (5) But the most serious misunderstanding naturally arose from
   Dionysius speaking of the Son as poiema (creature), and illustrating
   the word by the gardener with his vine and the shipwright with his
   boat. His defence is that though he had undoubtedly used such rather
   unsuitable figures somewhat casually, he had immediately adduced
   several others more suitable and apposite (such as those mentioned
   under (4) above). And he complains that not only here, but throughout,
   his accusers did not take his utterances as a whole, but slashed his
   writings about and made what sense of them they liked, not sincerely,
   but with evil intent. He tries further to explain that in his context
   poiein (make) was equivalent to gennan (beget), as of a Father, not a
   Creator, which he maintains is legitimate, but the defence is not very
   convincing all the same.

   So far as we can now judge, however, his arguments seem to have
   satisfied his critics at the time, and were certainly held in high
   repute by the ancient Churches, for they are quoted or referred to not
   only by Athanasius, as has been stated, but also by Eusebius, by Basil
   of Cæsarea (who is, however, much more temperate in his support), and
   by Jerome and Rufinus.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Dionysius's Last Days

   17. It is evident that, in spite of this controversy, his great
   reputation in the eyes of the Church was maintained to the end: for
   when the Council of Antioch was being summoned to deal with the
   troubles connected with the heresies of Paul of Samosata, who held
   views somewhat similar to those of Sabellius, Dionysius was specially
   invited to attend. As was said above on [30]p. 10, he excused himself
   from attendance on the ground of old age and infirmity, but he sent a
   letter in reply to the invitation which contained his views on the
   matter, and these were unfavourable to the heretic. In 265, before the
   Council had finished its sessions, he passed to his well-earned rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Dionysius as Author

   18. From what has already been said, it will be gathered that Dionysius
   was a person of remarkable versatility, and at the same time unusually
   free from those snares of the versatile man, shallowness and
   inaccuracy. The critical remarks on the Revelation of S. John the
   Divine from his treatise On the Promises (peri Epangelion), which are
   given in full (from Eusebius) on [31]pp. 82 ff., have received the most
   respectful consideration from such authorities as Bishop Westcott and
   Dr. Swete and are well worth reading, while some of the expositions of
   Biblical passages attributed to him are probably genuine and by no
   means destitute of merit, though none of them are printed in this
   volume.
     __________________________________________________________________

  As Christian Philosopher

   19. The long extracts which remain from his book On Nature (peri
   Phuseos), directed against the Epicureans, show him to have possessed
   on the whole a clear grasp of their tenets, together with much genuine
   humour and entire absence of bitterness of spirit in criticizing them.

   The extracts given by Eusebius appear to be fairly continuous
   throughout: they deal (1) with the atomistic portion of the Epicurean
   philosophy, and (2) with the more strictly "theological" portion of it,
   the references to the hedonistic doctrine being only slight and
   passing.

   Dionysius begins by remarking that of the various hypotheses which have
   been started as to the origin of the universe, one of the least
   satisfactory is that of Epicurus, viz. that it is the result of a
   chance concourse of an infinite number of atoms, as they rush through
   space.

   He then proceeds to show by a series of illustrations taken from human
   workmanship that mere chance could never produce the wonderful results
   that we see all around us. So, too, from the study of the heavens the
   same inference must be drawn.

   His next point appears to be that the difference in durability, which
   Epicurus postulates for the various bodies produced by atoms, goes to
   upset his theory. If some products (e. g. the gods) are eternal and
   some are short-lived, what determines the difference? Some of the
   senseless atoms themselves must be gifted with powers of directing,
   arranging and ruling. But if it is mere chance, then Epicurus asks us,
   who study the order and the phenomena of earth and heaven, to believe
   the impossible.

   The same conclusion is arrived at by the study of man, whose mere body
   is a machine so marvellous that some have emerged from the study of it
   with a belief that Phusis herself is a deity. The higher powers, too,
   of man, his mind and reason and skill, all point in the opposite
   direction to Epicurus's solution of the problem. It cannot, surely, be
   the atoms rather than the Muses which are responsible for the arts and
   sciences.

   The half-humorous allusion to these heaven-born personages of heathen
   mythology leads Dionysius to attack the Epicurean theory of the gods.
   According to Epicurus, the gods in no way concern themselves with
   mundane matters, but spend a serene existence without labour or
   exertion of any kind. But such an existence, says Dionysius, is so
   repugnant to the very idea and instinct of man that it must be
   absolutely false with regard to divine beings.

   At this point occurs a short passage in which the inconsistency of
   Democritus, from whom Epicurus had confessedly borrowed his physics,
   mutatis mutandis, is criticized, though it has only a general bearing
   upon the line of argument. Democritus, he says, who professed that he
   would have given the world in exchange for the discovery of one good
   cause (aitiologia), yet in putting forward his ideas of Chance as a
   cause could not have been more absurd: he sets up Tuche as the
   sovereign cause of the Universe, and yet banishes her as a power from
   the life of men. The truth is that, while practical men and even
   philosophers find their highest pleasure in benefiting others, by this
   theory the gods are to be kept from any share in such pleasure.

   One other inconsistency in the Epicurean writings Dionysius next deals
   with, and that is Epicurus's own constant use of oaths and adjurations,
   in which the names of those very beings occur whose influence upon
   men's affairs he so depreciates. This is, in Dionysius's opinion, due
   to his fear of being put to death by the state for atheism, as Socrates
   had been: though he is probably doing Epicurus a wrong.

   The extracts end with a repetition of the appeal to the wonders of the
   sky and of the earth as a conclusive contradiction of Epicurus's views.

  General Characteristics of his Writings

   20. The letter to Basilides on several points of ecclesiastical order
   (the larger portion of which is given on [33]pp. 76 ff.) is a model of
   what such episcopal utterances should be: it definitely states which is
   the highest and best course, but leaves the decision to the individual
   conscience. But it is to the general correspondence ([34]pp. 35 ff.)
   that the bulk of English readers will probably turn, and that deals
   with a large variety of subjects: in some cases theological matters
   like Novatianism and the baptism of heretics are discussed; in others
   there are descriptions of the martyrdoms of his time at Alexandria and
   his own personal experiences under persecution, all told with a
   vividness and a sobriety eminently characteristic of the man: others
   are addressed to persons or districts in his province, especially at
   Eastertide, treating of matters of local and temporary importance,
   while one or two incidents which he records are of much value as
   illustrating church customs and manners of the period (e. g. the case
   of Sarapion on [35]p. 42, prayers for the Emperors on [36]p. 47,
   matters connected with the celebration of Holy Baptism and Holy
   Communion on [37]p. 59).

   In his controversy with the Sabellians, as we have already remarked,
   some of the expressions and figures employed were insufficiently
   guarded or explained and so laid Dionysius open to criticism: but we
   must remember how much more easy it is for us, who have the benefit of
   subsequent history and experience, to see this and to correct it, than
   it was for him and for his contemporaries to grope their way, as they
   slowly but surely did, under the Divine guidance to a fuller knowledge
   and a more accurate statement of the truth.

   21. It is further to be noticed how very seldom, if ever, Dionysius
   offends against the principles of good taste either when attacking
   opponents, or when describing horrors, or when dealing with the
   mysteries of the Faith. In controversy he always displays an admirable
   moderation and sweetness of tone, which is the more remarkable because
   his convictions were strong and definite. This is especially to be
   observed in his treatment of Novatianus the intruder (see [38]p. 50),
   in his criticism of the deceased Nepos of Arsenoe (see [39]p. 82), and
   to a less extent in his defence of himself against the charges of
   Germanus (see [40]p. 43). Even when he has to speak of one whom he
   believes to have done him wrong, like the Prefect Æmilianus ([41]p.
   48), or of one whom his soul abhors like Macrianus ([42]p. 68), his
   language is mild in comparison with that of many in similar
   circumstances. So, too, when he takes upon himself to describe the
   tortures and deaths of the martyrs ([43]pp. 35 f.), or the ravages of
   pestilence ([44]p. 74), he indulges in but few ghastly or revolting
   details, though his narrative is always lively and thrilling. And once
   more when he deals with such a subject as the Eternal Sonship of our
   Lord, or, if the passage (not here given) be authentic, His Death and
   Passion, the same good taste and restraint of language is to be
   observed.

   22. Dionysius's literary style is excellent for the age in which he
   lived, and so far confirms the truth of the statement that he had been
   a master of rhetoric before his conversion. He gives evidence of having
   read widely and to good purpose both in classical and in religious
   literature. As to the former, he actually quotes from or refers to
   Homer, Hesiod, Thucydides, Aristotle, and Democritus: but his language
   is really saturated with classical uses, and a large number of the
   words and phrases which he employs recall the best writers of
   antiquity. His compositions exhibit signs of much care in production,
   notably the treatise On Nature (peri Phuseos) and the two Easter
   letters, to the Alexandrians and to Hierax (pp. [45]70 and [46]73).
   Here, and to a somewhat less degree in the letter to Hermammon ([47]pp.
   65 ff.), he writes in a more rhetorical and elaborate manner than in
   most of the other fragments which are extant, but even in these
   passages he is seldom fantastic, or stilted, or obscure; whilst in pure
   narrative or simple description (e. g. in the letters which record his
   own or others' sufferings and in the treatise On the Promises (peri
   Epangelion)), his language could hardly be more unaffected or better
   chosen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Dionysius as Interpreter of Scripture

   23. To what extent did Dionysius accept the principles and methods of
   Origen, especially in the matter of Biblical criticism and
   interpretation? The evidence, such as it is, is rather doubtful and
   conflicting. It is somewhat ominous that after the death of Bishop
   Demetrius, whose denunciations had caused the master's removal from
   Alexandria and his retirement to Cæsarea, we hear of no effort on the
   part of Dionysius or of any other pupil to obtain his recall. This
   certainly suggests that, great as their regard and respect for him as a
   man and a scholar may have been, they either felt themselves powerless
   to reinstate him, or else considered his views and methods of
   advocating them detrimental to the welfare of the Church at large. On
   the other hand, it is pleasing to remember that Dionysius wrote an
   epistle to his old teacher on the subject of martyrdom, which we may
   presume was designed to comfort him during his imprisonment at Tyre. We
   learn, too, on somewhat late authority that after Origen's death
   Dionysius wrote a letter to Theotecnus, Bishop of Cæsarea, extolling
   his master's virtues. The chief methodical comments on the Bible, of
   the authenticity of which we may be certain, are those contained in the
   fragments of the treatise On the Promises (peri Epangelion), reproduced
   on [48]pp. 82 ff. This was a direct reply to the Refutation of
   Allegorists (Elenchos Allegoriston), in which Nepos of Arsenoe had
   thought to support his grossly materialistic views of the Millennium by
   the Revelation of S. John the Divine. As the title suggests, this work
   had, no doubt, attacked Origen's fondness for the allegorical
   interpretation of Scripture, and especially on the subject of the
   Millennium, and therefore we may with some amount of certainty infer
   that Dionysius in his refutation of Nepos would accept Origen's methods
   as a commentator. But the extracts preserved by Eusebius deal almost
   wholly with the authorship and textual criticism, and so give no proper
   clue as to his method of interpreting the subject-matter of the book.

   In the letter to Basilides ([49]pp. 76 ff.) the requirements of the
   case do not call for a style of interpretation which would bring out
   either a correspondence or a disagreement with Origen's methods, except
   so far as it is marked by the frank and free exercise of critical
   judgment. The commentary on the Beginning of Ecclesiastes, if it is, as
   seems likely, in part the work of Dionysius, is not inconsistent in
   style of treatment with a general acceptance of his master's position.
   Procopius of Gaza, however, ranks him among the opponents of the
   allegorical school of interpreters, stating that it was in this very
   work that Dionysius attacked his master, and a short extract which has
   been assigned to it by Pitra (Spic. Solesm., i, 17) is distinctly less
   allegorical in treatment than the rest: it runs as follows--

   "On Eccles. iv. 9, 10: Two are better than one,' etc. As we understand
   this literally, we do not admit those who accept the interpretation of
   the statements as referring to the soul and the body; for it is by no
   means justified, seeing that the soul has the entire control over the
   ruling and governing both of itself and of the body, whereas the body
   is the bondman of the soul, subservient and enthralled to it in all its
   decisions. If, then, the soul be inclined to what is mean and evil, and
   become careless of better thoughts and considerations, the body is
   unable to restore it and lead it back to higher things: for that is not
   natural to it."

   There is also another short extract (on Gen. ii. 8, 9 [9] ) attributed
   to our author, which is non-allegorical in its treatment. The evidence
   therefore is inconclusive on this point: for though Jerome also
   mentions Dionysius as a commentator on the Bible three times in his
   letters, he throws no further light on the question. [10]

   On the subject of Inspiration we have no ground for thinking that
   Dionysius took up an independent position. [11] He introduces his
   Biblical quotation with the phrases current amongst early Christian
   writers.

   The general impression therefore left upon the reader is that Dionysius
   reverted to the more sober methods of interpreting Scripture that
   prevailed throughout the Church of his day as a whole, though he
   approached his master's theories in his usual sympathetic spirit and
   availed himself of much that was valuable in them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] The particular passage, however, adduced by Procopius above is Gen.
   iii. 21.

   [10] On this point C. H. Turner's article in Hastings's Dictionary of
   the Bible, Vol. V, pp. 496 f. (on Patristic Commentaries), may be
   consulted.

   [11] The passage on Luke xxii, quoted by Dr. Sanday (Inspiration, p.
   36), is of very doubtful authenticity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  His Place in the Church Kalendar

   24. We hear of a Church dedicated to S. Denys in Alexandria at the
   beginning of the fourth century, which was destroyed by fire in a
   tumult in the time of Athanasius. October 3 and November 17 are the two
   most usual dates for his Commemoration in the Kalendar, the former date
   more especially in the East, where he is honoured as "a holy martyr."
   [12]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] "Martyr" in this case need not necessarily be taken strictly as
   meaning "one put to death for the Faith," though no doubt the mediæval
   tradition was in favour of his martyrdom in that sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Concluding Remarks

   25. The foregoing sketch is sufficient to show that, as a man of action
   and a ruler of the Church, Dionysius's personality is no less striking
   than as a student, a writer and a thinker. He was clearly a strong yet
   conciliatory administrator of his province as Bishop of Alexandria,
   just as he had been a competent and successful teacher and director of
   sacred studies as head of the Catechetical Schools--one who in each
   capacity carried on and maintained the great traditions which he
   inherited from S. Mark and his successors, from Pantænus, Clement and
   Origen. And not only at home and within his own jurisdiction, as we
   have seen, did he worthily "magnify his office" and "make full proof of
   his ministry"; for he made his influence for good felt throughout
   Christendom. Bishops and clergy from all parts naturally turned to him
   in their difficulties for advice and guidance; and it is impossible not
   to feel that his wonderful breadth of judgment and his love of
   conciliation were of the greatest value to the Church of the third
   century, and will remain a model for imitation to each succeeding age.
   Men will always be tempted, as they were in that century, to speak
   strongly and to act vehemently where their spiritual beliefs are
   involved, and we may pray that God will never fail to raise up amongst
   the rulers of His Church men of the type of S. Denys the Great of
   Alexandria.

  Bibliography

   26. The first attempt at making a full collection of our author's
   remains was undertaken by Simon de Magistris, whose edition was
   published at Rome in 1796. Routh (Reliquiæ Sacræ, tom. iii. and iv.;
   Oxford, 1846) and Migne (Patr. Græc. tom. x.) published considerable
   portions with Latin notes, while Gallandius (Bibliotheca vett. patrum,
   app. to vol. xiv.), Pitra, Mai and (more recently) Holl in vol. v. of
   Texte und Untersuchungen (neue Folge) have printed a number of
   fragments from various sources and of very varying degrees of probable
   authenticity.

   The earliest list of Dionysius's literary productions, except the
   scattered references to be found in the [50]Ecclesiastical History of
   Eusebius, is that of Jerome ([51]de viris illustribus, 69), which more
   or less tallies with what we gather from Eusebius. The student will,
   however, find a complete modern list of them, together with other
   valuable matter, in Harnack, Altchrist. Lit., vol. i. pp. 409-27, and
   in Bardenhewer, Altkirch. Lit., vol. ii. pp. 167-91: the account in
   Krüger, Early Christian Literature (Eng. Trans.) is much shorter.
   Several compositions mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome are only known to
   us by name, unless some of the short extracts attributed to Dionysius
   come from one or other of them, and the contents of them are almost
   wholly matter for conjecture. The most important of these is perhaps
   the epistole diakonike dia Hippolutou ([52]Eus., H. E. vi. 45), because
   of the various theories which have been put forward about it. Dom Morin
   (Revue Bénédictine, xvii., 1900), for instance, suggested that
   Rufinus's translation of the doubtful epithet (diakonike) being de
   ministeriis, it was none other than the Canons of Hippolytus, and that
   the Canons were afterwards attributed to the church-writer, Hippolytus,
   through a mistaken identification of the unknown bearer of Dionysius's
   missive with the well-known author; but the theory has not met with
   much acceptance since, and the discussion has of late died down, quite
   different views being now held about the Canons of Hippolytus.

   It may also be mentioned that several fragments in Syriac and in
   Armenian are attributed to Dionysius, but only three of these, in the
   former language, appear to be genuine: one is a translation of the
   letter to Novatian ([53]p. 50), and the two others are, whether rightly
   or wrongly, thought to be part of the Letter to Stephanus on Baptism,
   and will be found as §§ 2 and 3 of it on [54]pp. 53 ff.

   The article on [55]Dionysius in Smith's [56]Dictionary of Christian
   Biography is by Dr. Westcott, and, though not very full, is, it is
   needless to say, worthy of being consulted.

   Three German books on our author will also be found useful, though not
   very recent: viz. Förster, de doctrin. et sententiis Dionysii,
   Berolini, 1865; Dittrich, Dionysius der Grosse, Freiburg, i.B., 1867;
   and Roch, Dionysius der Grosse über die Natur, Leipzig, 1882. Of these
   the second is the most important for the general student.

   Dr. Salmond produced a serviceable translation of the fragments in 1871
   ([57]T. & T. Clark's series, Edinburgh), and since then we have had Dr.
   Gifford's (in his scholarly edition of Eus., Præpar. Evang., Oxford,
   1903), of such as there appear.

   For the general history of the period much valuable help will be found
   in Archbishop Benson's Cyprian, London, 1897; P. Allard, Histoire des
   Persécutions, vols. ii. and iii., Paris, 1886, and Aubé, L'Eglise et
   l'Etat dans la 2de moitié du 3me Siècle.

   A full collection of all the genuine and doubtful extracts appeared in
   the series of Cambridge Patristic Texts, with introductions and notes
   by the present editor, in 1904.

LETTERS
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Fabian, Bishop of Antioch
  ([58]Eus., H. E. vi. 41, 42, and 44)

   (1) The persecution did not begin amongst us with the Imperial edict;
   for it anticipated that by a whole year. And the prophet and poet of
   evil to this city, whoever he was, [13] was beforehand in moving and
   exciting the heathen crowds against us, rekindling their zeal for the
   national superstitions. So they being aroused by him and availing
   themselves of all lawful authority for their unholy doings, conceived
   that the only piety, the proper worship of their gods was this--to
   thirst for our blood. First, then, they carried off an old man, Metras,
   and bade him utter impious words, [14] and when he refused they beat
   his body with sticks and stabbed his face and eyes with sharp bulrushes
   as they led him into the outskirts of the city and there stoned him.
   Then they led a believer named Quinta to the idol-house and tried to
   make her kneel down, and, when she turned away in disgust, they bound
   her by the feet and hauled her right through the city over the rough
   pavement, the big stones bruising her poor body, and at the same time
   beat her till they reached the same spot, and there stoned her.
   Thereupon they all with one consent made a rush on the houses of the
   believers, and, falling each upon those whom they recognized as
   neighbours, plundered, harried and despoiled them, setting aside the
   more valuable of their possessions and casting out into the streets and
   burning the cheaper things and such as were made of wood, till they
   produced the appearance of a city devastated by the enemy. But the
   brethren gave way and submitted and accepted the plundering of their
   possessions with joy like unto those of whom Paul also testified. [15]
   And I know not if any, save possibly a single one who fell into their
   hands, up till now has denied the Lord.

   Another notable case was that of the aged virgin Apollonia, whom they
   seized and knocked out all her teeth, striking her on the jaws: then
   they made a pyre before the city and threatened to burn her alive, if
   she would not join them in uttering blasphemies. But she asked for a
   brief respite, and being let go, suddenly leapt into the fire and was
   devoured by the flames. Sarapion, also, they caught in his own house,
   and after outraging him with cruel tortures and crushing all his limbs,
   they cast him headlong from the upper storey.

   And we could go by no high road, thoroughfare, or byway, either by day
   or by night; for everywhere and always there was a constant cry that
   any one who did not utter words of blasphemy must be dragged off and
   burnt.

   And this state of things prevailed for some time, till the revolution
   and civil war [16] occupied the attention of these unhappy men and
   turned on one another their fury against us. And so we had a short
   breathing space, as they found no leisure for raging against us: but
   very soon the overthrow of the ruler who had been not unfavourable to
   us [17] is announced, and our grave fears of being attacked are
   renewed. And, in fact, the edict arrived, which was itself almost to be
   compared with that foretold by the Lord, well-nigh the most terrible of
   all, so as to cause, if possible, even the elect to stumble. [18]
   Nevertheless all were panic-stricken, and numbers at once of those who
   were in higher positions, some came forward in fear, and some who held
   public posts were led by their official duties; others, again, were
   brought in by those about them, and when their names were called,
   approached the impure and unholy sacrifices; pale and trembling in some
   cases as if they were not going to sacrifice but themselves become
   sacrifices and victims to the idols, so that they incurred ridicule
   from the large crowd that stood by, and proved themselves to be utter
   cowards both in regard to death and in regard to sacrificing, whilst
   others ran readily up to the altar, making it plain by their
   forwardness that they had not been Christians even before. About such
   the Lord's prediction is most true that with difficulty shall they be
   saved. [19] And of the rest [20] some followed one or other of the
   above, while others fled or were captured: and of these last, again,
   some after going as far as chains and imprisonment, and even after
   being immured several days in certain cases, still, before coming into
   court, forswore themselves; and others, even after enduring some amount
   of torment, failed at the last. But the steadfast and blessed pillars
   of the Lord, [21] being strengthened by Him and receiving due and
   proportionate power and endurance for the mighty Faith that was in
   them, proved themselves admirable witnesses of His Kingdom. [22]
   Foremost among them was Julian, a sufferer from gout, unable to stand
   or walk; he was brought up with two others, who carried him, of whom
   the one straightway denied the Faith; the other, Cronion by name, but
   surnamed Eunous (well-disposed), and the old man Julian himself
   confessed the Lord and were conveyed on camel's back, and scourged as
   they rode right through the city--big though it be, as ye know--and at
   last were burnt with fire unquenchable, whilst all the people stood
   round. And a soldier who stood by as they were carried along and
   protested against those who insulted them was denounced and brought up,
   to wit God's brave warrior Besas, and after heroic conduct in the great
   war of piety was beheaded. And yet another, a Libyan by race, who
   rightly and happily was named Mauar (happy), [23] though the judge
   urged him strongly to renounce the Faith, would not give in, and so was
   burnt alive. After them Epimachus and Alexander, when they had remained
   a long time in bonds and had endured endless tortures from the "claws"
   [24] and scourges, were also consumed with fire unquenchable. And with
   them four [25] women: Ammonarion, a holy virgin, though the judge
   tortured her vigorously for a long time because she had declared
   beforehand that she would say nothing that he bade her, kept true to
   her promise and was led off to punishment; and of the rest there was
   the aged and reverend Mercuria and Dionysia, who, though she had many
   children, did not love them above the Lord: these the Prefect was
   ashamed to go on torturing in vain and be beaten by women, and so they
   died by the sword without further tortures: for the brave Ammonarion
   had exhausted all their devices.

   Then were delivered up three Egyptians: Heron, Ater and Isidore, and
   with them Dioscorus, a lad of about fifteen. And first of all the
   Prefect tried to cajole the stripling with words, thinking he could
   easily be won over, and then to force him by torments, thinking he
   would soon give in, but Dioscorus was neither persuaded nor forced. So
   the others he cruelly lacerated, and when they, too, stood firm, handed
   them over to the fire; but Dioscorus, who had distinguished himself in
   public and had answered his private questionings most wisely, he let
   off, saying that he granted him a reprieve for repenting, on account of
   his age. And now [26] the godly Dioscorus is still with us, having
   waited for his longer trial and his more determined conflict.

   Another Egyptian, Nemesion, was falsely accused of being an associate
   of brigands, but being accused of that most untrue charge before the
   centurion, he was then denounced as a Christian and came in chains
   before the Prefect. [27] And he having most unjustly maltreated him
   with twice as many tortures and stripes as the brigands had received,
   burnt him to death between them, being honoured, happy man, by the
   example of Christ. [28]

   Again a whole quaternion of soldiers--Ammon, Zenon, Ptolemy and
   Ingenuus, and an old man, Theophilus, with them, were standing before
   the judgment seat, whilst some one was being tried for being a
   Christian, and when he showed signs of denying the Faith they were so
   provoked as they stood by, nodding their heads, and stretching out
   their hands and making gestures with their bodies, that they drew the
   general attention to themselves, and then, before any could seize them,
   they leapt upon the stand [29] of their own accord, saying they were
   Christians, so that the Prefect and his assessors were frightened, and
   those who were being judged seemed to take courage over what awaited
   them, and their judges lost heart. So these soldiers walked in brave
   procession from the court and rejoiced in their witness (martyrdom),
   God giving them a glorious triumph. [30]

   (2) And many others in the cities and villages were torn asunder by the
   heathen (Gentiles), one of which I will mention as an example.
   Ischyrion acted as steward to one of the authorities at a wage. His
   employer bade him sacrifice, ill-treated him when he refused, and on
   his persistence drove him forth with insults: when he still stood his
   ground, he took a big stick and killed him by driving it through his
   vital parts. What need to mention the multitude of those who wandered
   in deserts and mountains [31] consumed by hunger and thirst and cold
   and diseases and brigands and wild beasts? the survivors of whom bear
   witness to their election and victory. [32] Of these, also, I will
   bring forward one instance by way of illustration. Chæremon was the
   aged Bishop of what is called Nilopolis. He fled to the Arabian hills
   [33] with his wife [34] and never returned, nor were they ever seen
   again by the brethren, who made long search, but found neither them nor
   their bodies. And there were many who on those very Arabian hills were
   sold into slavery by the barbarian Saracens, [35] of whom some were
   with difficulty ransomed at high sums, and others even yet have not
   been ransomed. And these things I have described at length, brother,
   not without purpose, but in order that thou mightest know how many
   terrible things have taken place amongst us, of which those who have
   had more experience will know of more cases than I do.

   Then shortly after he proceeds--

   (3) Accordingly, the holy martyrs themselves, when still amongst us,
   who are now the assessors of Christ and partners of His Kingdom,
   sharing His judgments and decisions, [36] espoused the cause of certain
   of the fallen brethren who had incurred the charge of having done
   sacrifice, and seeing their conversion and repentance and approving it
   as fit to be accepted by Him who desireth not at all the death of the
   sinner so much as his repentance, [37] received them, summoned them to
   assemblies, introduced them and admitted them to the prayers and
   feasts. [38] What, then, do ye counsel us in these matters, brethren?
   What ought we to do? Shall we acquiesce and assent to them and maintain
   their decision and concession and treat kindly those to whom they have
   extended mercy? or shall we hold their judgment wrong and set ourselves
   up as critics of their decision and vex their kind hearts and reverse
   their arrangement?

   [A further extract on the subject of the lapsed]

   I will set out the following single example that happened amongst us.
   There was a certain aged believer amongst us, Sarapion, who had lived
   blamelessly for a long time but yielded to temptation. This man often
   begged to be restored, but no one heeded him; for he had sacrificed.
   But he fell ill, and for three days in succession he remained
   speechless and unconscious. Then recovering a little on the fourth day,
   he called to him his nephew and said: "How long, my child, do ye keep
   me back? hasten ye, I pray, and let me go speedily. Call thou one of
   the elders (presbyters)." After this he became speechless again. The
   boy ran for the elder, but it was night and he was ill and could not
   come. Now I had given instructions that if those who were departing
   life asked and especially when they chanced to have made supplication
   even before, they should be absolved in order that they might depart in
   good hope; he gave the boy, therefore, a morsel of the Eucharist,
   bidding him moisten it and drop it into the old man's mouth. The lad
   went back with it. When he drew near, before he entered, Sarapion
   revived again and said: "Hast come, child? The presbyter could not
   come, but do thou quickly what he bade thee, and let me go." So the boy
   moistened it and dropped it into his mouth: and the other shortly after
   swallowing it straightway gave up the ghost. Was he not clearly
   sustained and kept alive until he was absolved that, with his sin wiped
   out, he might be acknowledged (by the Lord) for the many good things he
   had done?

   [13] It looks as if Dionysius was afraid to mention his name. Perhaps
   it was Sabinus the Prefect. The word "poet" in Greek means properly
   "maker," and there is evidently a double entendre in its use here.

   [14] i. e. against Christ (1 Cor. xii. 3).

   [15] The reference is to Heb. x. 34. It will be noticed that Dionysius
   attributes this Epistle to S. Paul, either inadvertently or in
   accordance with the Alexandrine tradition, which Origen also accepts
   (Eus., H. E., vi. 25).

   [16] Viz. the revolt of Decius in Oct. 249.

   [17] i. e. Philip the Arabian, who was popularly supposed to be half a
   Christian.

   [18] The reference is obviously to Matt. xxiv. 24 (Mark xiii. 22)
   though Dionysius has substituted "cause to stumble" (skandalisai) for
   "cause to go astray" (planesai or apoplanan).

   [19] The reference is very loosely to Matt. xix. 23 and 25.

   [20] Viz. those who held no prominent position; the ordinary folk.

   [21] Cp. Gal. ii. 9.

   [22] Cp. Acts xxviii. 23 and Rev. i. 9.

   [23] There is evidently an allusion here to Matt. v. 11 and Luke vi.
   22.

   [24] Viz. the ungulæ, with which the flesh was torn from the bones.

   [25] Only three are mentioned in the text.

   [26] i. e. some time between 251, when persecution ended with the death
   of Decius, and 257, when Valerian revived it.

   [27] The first was a martial offence, the second a civil.

   [28] i. e. by being allowed to follow Christ's example.

   [29] This was the catasta, or platform, which corresponded to our
   prisoner's dock.

   [30] Dionysius's language recalls 2 Cor. ii. 14; Col. ii. 15 is
   different.

   [31] Cf. Heb. xi. 38.

   [32] i. e. they showed themselves worthy of being among the elect.

   [33] A range of hills to the east of the Nile seems to have been so
   called.

   [34] On the marriage of the clergy at this time, see Bingham, Antiq.,
   IV, v. § 5.

   [35] This is probably the earliest extant mention of the Saracens--at
   least by that name.

   [36] The opinion that the martyrs passed at once to heaven and shared
   His throne was general among the early Fathers (see Matt. xix. 28 and 1
   Cor. vi. 2, 3).

   [37] Cp. Ezek. xviii. 23, xxxiii. 11, 2 Pet. iii. 9.

   [38] These expressions are not to be pressed as if they assumed
   episcopal authority.

  To Germanus a Bishop
  (Eus., [59]H. E. vi. 40 and [60]vii. 11)

   (1) Now before God I speak and He knoweth if I lie; [39] not at all on
   my own judgment nor yet without Divine guidance did I take flight, but
   on a former occasion also as soon as ever the persecution under Decius
   was set up, [40] Sabinus [41] sent a frumentarius [42] to seek me; and
   I awaited his arrival at my house for four days, while he went round
   searching everywhere, the streams, the roads and the fields, where he
   suspected me to hide or go, but he never lighted on my house, being
   held by blindness: for he did not believe I should stay at home under
   pursuit. And hardly after the four days when God bade me remove and
   unexpectedly made a way for me, I and the boys [43] and many of the
   brethren went out together. And this was ordered by the Providence of
   God, as after events have shown, in which perchance we have been useful
   to some.

   Further on he proceeds--

   (2) For about sunset I with my companions having fallen into the hands
   of the soldiers, was taken to Taposiris, but Timotheus [44] by the
   Providence of God happened not to be present nor to be caught
   elsewhere. But arriving afterwards, he found the house empty and
   servants guarding it, and us carried off prisoners.

   And further on--

   (3) And what is the manner of His wonderful dispensation? for only the
   truth shall be spoken. One of the rustics met Timotheus as he was
   fleeing and troubled, [45] and inquired the reason of his haste. And he
   told the truth, and when the other heard it (now he was going to a
   marriage revel: for it is their custom to pass the whole night at such
   gatherings), he entered and informed those who were reclining at table.
   And they with one consent as if at a signal all arose and came running
   at great speed and fell upon us with loud cries, and when the soldiers
   who were guarding us straightway took to flight, they came upon us just
   as we were reclining on the bare bedsteads. And I indeed, God wot,
   taking them at first to be bandits who had come for plunder and ravage,
   remained on the couch where I was, undressed save for my linen
   under-garment, [46] and began to offer them the rest of my raiment
   which was at my side. But they bade me rise and go out as quickly as I
   could. And then I, understanding why they had come, cried out begging
   and praying them to depart and leave us, and if they would do us a good
   turn, I besought them to forestall those who had carried me off and cut
   off my head themselves. And while I thus cried, as they know who shared
   and took part in everything, they raised me by force, and when I let
   myself down on my back to the ground, they took and led me out,
   dragging me by the arms and legs. And there followed me those who had
   been witnesses of all this, Gaius, Faustus, Peter and Paul, and they
   also helped to carry me out of the township in their arms, and then
   putting me on a barebacked ass, led me away.

   [Another extract from the same letter given by Eusebius in another part
   of his History, and referring to a somewhat later period in Dionysius's
   life]

   (4) I am really in danger of falling into much foolishness [47] and
   want of right feeling through being compelled of necessity to narrate
   God's wondrous dispensation concerning us. But since "it is good," it
   says, [48] "to keep close the secret of a king but glorious to reveal
   the works of God," I will come to close quarters with our violent
   accuser, Germanus. I came before Æmilian [49] not alone; for there
   followed with me my fellow-presbyter [50] Maximus, and deacons Faustus,
   Eusebius and Chæremon. And one of the brethren who was present from
   Rome came in with us. Now Æmilian did not say to me at the start, "Do
   not summon" (the brethren for public worship): for that was superfluous
   and the last thing (to insist on), since he was going back to the very
   beginning of the matter. For the question was not about summoning
   others but about not being Christians ourselves, and it was from this
   that he bade us desist, thinking that if I should change my mind, the
   others would follow me. And I answered not unsuitably nor yet very
   differently from the words: "We ought to obey God rather than men,"
   [51] but I testified outright that I worship the only God and none
   other, nor will I ever alter nor desist from being a Christian. Upon
   this he bade us go away to a village on the borders of the desert named
   Cephro. Listen then to what was said on both sides as it was
   (officially) recorded: Dionysius, Faustus, Maximus, Marcellus [52] and
   Chæremon being brought in, Æmilian the Prefect said: "In the course of
   conversation also [53] I described to you the clemency which our
   Sovereigns [54] have displayed towards you. For they gave you
   opportunity of being liberated if you would adopt a natural line of
   conduct and worship the gods who protect the Empire and give up those
   who are contrary to nature. What say ye then to this? for I do not
   expect you will be ungrateful for their clemency when they invite you
   to a better course." Dionysius answered: "It is not a fact that all men
   worship all gods, for each worships certain whom he believes in. So
   with us, we worship and adore the One God, the Creator of all things,
   who has entrusted the Empire also to the most religious Emperors,
   Valerian and Gallienus; and to Him we pray [55] without ceasing for
   their Empire that it may abide unshaken." Æmilian the Prefect said,
   "But who prevents you from worshipping him also, if he be god, with the
   natural gods? for you were ordered to worship gods and those which all
   know." Dionysius answered: "We worship none other but Him." Æmilian the
   Prefect said to them: "I observe that you together are both ungrateful
   and insensible of the leniency of our Emperors. Wherefore ye shall not
   be in this city but shall be dismissed to the parts of Libya and stay
   in a place called Cephro, which I have chosen at the bidding of our
   Emperors. And both you and others will be absolutely forbidden either
   to hold meetings or to enter the cemeteries so-called. [56] And if any
   one were to appear not to have arrived at the place I have ordered or
   were found at any assembly, he will do so at his own risk. For the
   necessary penalty will not be wanting. Be off therefore where ye were
   bidden." So he hurried me away even though I was sick, granting me not
   a day's respite. What leisure, then, had I to call assemblies or not?
   [57]

   Further on he says--

   (5) But we did not abstain even from the visible assembling of
   ourselves together in the Lord's presence, but those who were in the
   city (Alexandria) I the more earnestly urged to assemble, as if I were
   still with them, being absent in the body, as it says, but present in
   the spirit. [58] And at Cephro also a large number of the Church were
   sojourning with us, consisting of the brethren who had followed us from
   the city or were present from other parts of Egypt. There, too, the
   Lord opened us a door for the word. [59] And at first we were pursued
   and stoned, but later not a few of the Gentiles left their idols and
   turned to God. Thus the word was first sown through us in their hearts
   who had not previously received it. And as it were for this cause God
   having led us to them, led us away again when we had fulfilled this
   ministry. [60] For Æmilian wished, as it seemed, to transfer us to
   rougher and more Libyan-like parts, and bade those who were scattered
   in every direction to draw together to the Mareotis, assigning to each
   party one of the villages of the district, but us he put more on the
   road so that we should be the first to be arrested. For he evidently
   managed and arranged so that he might have us easy of capture whenever
   he wished to seize us. And as for me, when I was ordered to depart to
   Cephro, I did not even know in what direction the place lay, hardly
   having heard so much as the name before; and yet I went off willingly
   and without trouble. But when it was told me that they would remove me
   to the parts of Colluthion, all who were present know how I was
   affected. For here I will accuse myself. At first I was vexed and took
   it very ill. For though the place happened to be better known and more
   familiar to us, yet people said it was devoid of brethren and
   respectable folk, being exposed to the annoyances of wayfarers and the
   attacks of robbers. But I found consolation when the brethren reminded
   me that it is nearer to the city, and that, while Cephro gave much
   opportunity of intercourse with brethren from Egypt in general, so that
   one could draw congregations from a wider area, yet at Colluthion we
   should more constantly enjoy the sight of those who were really loved
   and most intimate and dear. For they would be able to come and stay the
   night and there would be district-meetings as is the case with outlying
   suburbs. [61] And so it turned out.

   And lower down again he writes this about what had happened to him--

   (6) Many indeed are the confessions of faith over which Germanus prides
   himself: many are the things which he has to mention as having happened
   to him. Can he reckon up as many in his own case as I can in
   mine--condemnations, confiscations, sales by public auction, spoiling
   of one's possessions, loss of dignities, despisings of worldly honour,
   contempt of commendations by Prefects and Councils and of opponents'
   threats, endurance of clamourings and dangers and persecutions and
   wanderings and tribulations and much affliction, such as are the things
   which have happened unto me under Decius and Sabinus and up to the
   present time under Æmilian? But where did Germanus appear? What talk
   was there of him? However, I withdraw from the much foolishness into
   which I am falling through Germanus; wherefore I refrain from giving a
   detailed account of events to the brethren who know all.

  (To Novatian)
  ([61]Eus., H. E. vi. 45)

   If it was against thy will, as thou sayest, that thou wast promoted,
   [62] thou wilt prove this by retiring of thine own accord. It were good
   to suffer anything and everything so to escape dividing the Church of
   God. And martyrdom [63] to avoid schism is no less glorious than
   martyrdom to avoid idolatry. Nay, it is to my mind greater. In one case
   a man is a martyr for his own single soul's sake. But this is for the
   whole Church. Even now wast thou to persuade or constrain the brethren
   to come to one mind, thy true deed [64] were greater than thy fall.
   This will not be reckoned to thee, the other will be lauded. And if
   thou shouldest be powerless to sway disobedient spirits, save, save
   thine own soul. [65] I pray for thy health and thy steadfast cleaving
   to peace in the Lord.

   [I have to thank the editors and publishers for leave to reprint the
   above translation by Archbishop Benson from his Cyprian, p. 142.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] Or perhaps "carried on" (to act as thou didst).

   [63] Strictly speaking, Novatian's withdrawal was not very likely to
   involve actual martyrdom.

   [64] The word is katorthoma (success); perhaps "recovery" would bring
   out the antithesis to "fall" (sphalma) better.

  To Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, in Reply to a Letter from him about Novatian
  (circ. 253)

   Eusebius ([62]H. E. vi. 46) quotes only one short sentence from
   Dionysius's letter, which refers to the death of Alexander, Bishop of
   Jerusalem, one of Origen's distinguished pupils and supporters.
   Alexander twice boldly confessed Christ in the Governor's Court at
   Cæsarea and died at last in prison. The sentence is as follows--

   "The admirable [66] Alexander entered into a blessed rest whilst in
   custody."

   According to Eusebius, the letter also mentioned the invitation which
   Dionysius had received from the Bishops of Asia Minor to attend a synod
   at Antioch at which "they tried to suppress the schism of Novatian."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [66] Another reading gives "blessed" (makarios), which, though less
   well supported by the MSS., makes the phrase makarios anepausato more
   pointed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Stephanus, Bishop of Rome
  ([63]Eus., H. E. vii. 4 and 5)
  (The First of the Epistles about Baptism)

   (1) Know now, brother, that all the Churches in the East and even
   further afield [67] which were divided, have been united: and all their
   rulers everywhere are of one mind, rejoicing exceedingly at the
   unexpected peace [68] which has come about, Demetrian in Antioch,
   Theoctistus in Cæsarea, Mazabbanes in Ælia, [69] Marinus in Tyre,
   Alexander having fallen asleep, Heliodorus in Laodicea, Thelymidrus
   being at rest, Helenus in Tarsus and all the Churches of Cilicia,
   Firmilianus [70] and all Cappadocia. For I have mentioned only the more
   prominent of the Bishops, in order that I may not make my letter too
   long nor my narrative wearisome. Nevertheless, the whole of Syria and
   Arabia, districts whose needs ye from time to time supply [71] and to
   whom ye now have sent an epistle, Mesopotamia also and Pontus and
   Bithynia, and, in one word, all men everywhere exult in the harmony and
   brotherly love displayed and praise God for it. [72]

   [The two following extracts are translated from Syriac versions, and I
   am indebted for them to Mr. N. MacLean of Christ's College, Cambridge.
   The first has been put together out of two MSS. in the British Museum,
   neither of which contains the whole, and was printed by Pitra, Analecta
   Sacra, Vol. IV. The Greek original of most of the first sentence is
   preserved in a catena on Deuteronomy, Cod. Vat. 1521, fol. 591, and was
   first printed by Simon de Magistris in his edition of our author, p.
   200. There is much probability that this extract formed part of the
   same letter to Stephanus as the extract from Eusebius which precedes it
   here. The second extract is found in three other Syriac MSS. in the
   British Museum, but is less certainly part of this letter, or indeed
   authentic at all.]

   (2) If so be that any man speak a wicked thing of God like those who
   call Him unpitying [73] or any man living in the fear of other gods,
   the Law has commanded that such a one be stoned: [74] but we would
   stone these men with sound words of faith. Or if a man receive not at
   all the mystery [75] of Christ or alter and distort it--(saying) that
   He is not God, or that he did not become a man, or that He did not die,
   or that He did not rise, or that He will not come to judge the quick
   and the dead--or preach anything else apart from what we preached, let
   him be a curse, says Paul. [76] Or if so be he have wronged the word
   concerning the resurrection of the flesh, let him be already reckoned
   with the dead. For we speak in carefulness concerning these things--in
   order that we may be in agreement one with another, churches with
   churches, bishops with bishops, priests with priests. And in regard to
   causes and affairs about matters which concern individual men--how it
   is right to receive him who approaches from without and how him who
   comes from within [77] --we counsel to obey those who stand at the head
   of every place who by Divine election [78] are put into this
   ministration--leaving to our Lord the judgment of all things which they
   do.

   (3) Those who were baptized in the name of the three Persons--the
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit--though they were baptized by
   heretics who confess the three Persons, shall not be re-baptized. But
   those who are converted from other heresies shall be perfected by the
   baptism of the Holy Church. [79]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] This expression probably means to include the Churches of
   Mesopotamia and Osroene, besides those which he proceeds to mention
   below.

   [68] Eusebius is mistaken in identifying this peace with the cessation
   of persecution: the reference is to the subsiding of the Novatianist
   schism in 254 which restored peace to Christendom. The surprise and joy
   were due to the violence of the language and other measures which the
   chief combatants (Stephen and Cyprian) had employed.

   [69] Hadrian's colony in Mount Sion was so named (A.D. 132). Later on
   the older and more glorious name of Jerusalem was restored to the see.

   [70] Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia ( A.D. 260), and one of Origen's
   distinguished pupils. On the baptismal controversy he sided with
   Cyprian of Carthage.

   [71] The adroit reference to the wonted liberality of the Roman Church
   is to be noted: other instances are given by Salmon, Infallibility, p.
   375.

   [72] Here again Dionysius shows his adroitness, if Benson (Cyprian, p.
   357) is right in thinking that the list of churches he gives suggests a
   repetition of the Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Ghost (Acts ii. 9
   f.).

   [73] Cp. the letter to Dionysius, p. 58.

   [74] Lev. xxiv. 13-16.

   [75] The word here used represents musterion, denoting the Christian
   revelation as musterion often does.

   [76] Cf. 1 Cor. xvi. 22 and Gal. i. 8, 9.

   [77] The former are converts from heathenism, or perhaps from heresy;
   the latter Christians who have lapsed.

   [78] The word here is the Greek cheirotonia in Syriac letters, and so
   might also be rendered "ordination."

   [79] The MSS. from which this extract comes state that it is from a
   letter to Dionysius and Stephanus of Rome. No such letter is otherwise
   known, and it is not likely that Stephen's name would come second, as
   he was then bishop and Dionysius only a presbyter, though later on he
   became bishop. Possibly it is from the letter which our Dionysius tells
   us he wrote to his Roman namesake and Philemon when they were of the
   same opinion as Stephen: see p. 55. As far as the contents of the
   extract go, it is not at all incredible that Dionysius was willing to
   admit the validity of such baptisms as are specified: it was only
   heresies of a very fundamental kind which he considered to invalidate
   baptism.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Xystus (or Sixtus) II [80]
  ([64]Eus., H. E. vii. 5, 3-6)
  (The second on the same subject)

   (1) (Stephen) therefore had sent word concerning Helenus and concerning
   Firmilianus, and all the bishops of Cilicia and Cappadocia and (be it
   noted) of Galatia and all the neighbouring churches likewise--to the
   effect that he would not hold communion with them for this same reason,
   since, he says, they re-baptize the heretics. [81] And observe the
   importance of the matter. For decrees had really been passed about it
   in the largest synods of the bishops, [82] as I am informed, so that
   those who come over from heretical bodies, after a course of
   instruction, are washed and cleansed from the defilement of the old and
   unclean leaven. [83] About all this also I have written asking him for
   information.

   (2) To our beloved fellow-presbyters also, Dionysius and Philemon, who
   had formerly sided with Stephanus and were correspondents of mine on
   the same matter, I have written briefly the first time and more fully
   now. [84]

   (3) The teaching which is now at work in Ptolemais of Pentapolis, [85]
   is impious, full of blasphemy about the Almighty God and Father [86] of
   our Lord Jesus Christ and full of unbelief about His only begotten Son,
   [87] the First-born of all creation, [88] the Incarnate Word, and
   displays want of perception concerning the Holy Spirit. And therefore,
   when both official communications from both parties arrived and some of
   the brethren sought personal interviews with me, I wrote what I could
   [89] by the Divine assistance and gave a somewhat methodical
   explanation of the matter, a copy of which I have sent you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] The successor to Stephanus in 257 as Bishop of Rome: he was
   martyred after one year's reign.

   [81] This was, according to Benson (Cyprian, p. 354), a threat which he
   did not actually carry into effect, and was only meant to restrain them
   from adopting Cyprian's attitude on the matter.

   [82] i. e. those of Iconium and Synnada (circ. 230): Dionysius may also
   be referring to the three much more recent councils which Cyprian had
   held at Carthage between 254 and 256 (i. e. since his letter to Stephen
   above). By this time he had by patient inquiry found out much more than
   he had known at first of what was necessary to be known before coming
   to a decision.

   [83] Cf. 1 Cor. vi. 11 and v. 7, 8.

   [84] See note on p. 54. Dionysius became afterwards Bishop of Rome in
   259: a fragment of a letter from our Dionysius to him is printed on p.
   58. His famous letter to our Dionysius on the Sabellian controversy is
   not included in this volume. Part of a letter to Philemon is given on
   p. 56. He was a Roman Presbyter.

   [85] On the north-west coast of Cyrenaica, one of the five chief cities
   which gave its name to the Libyan Pentapolis. Sabellius denied the
   three Persons in the Trinity, and held that the Person of the Father
   who is One with the Son was incarnate in Christ: see further p. 19.

   [86] There seems no doubt that this is the right reading here, though
   most of the MSS. read "God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ"; but
   clearly Dionysius is only speaking of God the Father in this clause and
   of Jesus Christ in the next. See 2 Cor. i. 2, Eph. i. 3, etc.

   [87] It was Dionysius's treatment of this subject which afterwards gave
   Arius the heresiarch of Alexandria an opening for claiming his teaching
   in support of his own tenets, though there is no Arian suggestion, of
   course, in this phrase: see p. 20.

   [88] Col. i. 15.

   [89] Eus., H. E. vii. 26, mentions letters to Ammonius, Bishop of
   Bernice, Telesphorus Euphranor and Euporus in this connexion.
   Athanasius appears only to have known one joint letter to Ammonius and
   Euphranor.

  To Philemon
  ([65]Eus., H. E. vii. 7)
  (The third on the same subject)

   (1) I read both the critical researches and the traditional treatises
   [90] of the heretics, defiling my soul a little with their abominable
   opinions and yet gaining this advantage from them, that I could refute
   them for myself and abhor them much more thoroughly. And indeed when a
   certain brother among the presbyters tried to restrain me and frighten
   me from contaminating myself with the mire of their iniquity (he said I
   should ruin my soul, and, as I perceived, there was truth in what he
   said), a heaven-sent vision [91] came and strengthened me, and words
   came to me which expressly ordered me thus: "Read all that may come to
   thy hands: for thou art competent to sift and test everything, and that
   was the original reason [92] of thy accepting the Faith." I
   acknowledged the vision as in agreement with the apostolic voice which
   says to the more able: "Approve yourselves bankers of repute." [93]

   (2) This cause and rule I received from our blessed Father [94]
   Heraclas. For those that came over from the heretics, although they had
   apostatized from the Church--or rather had not even done that but were
   informed against as resorting to some heretical teacher, though still
   reputed members of our congregations--these he repelled from the
   Church, and did not restore them at their request until they had
   publicly and fully stated all that they had heard among those who set
   themselves against us; and then he admitted them without requiring them
   to be re-baptized: for they had received that holy gift already.

   (3) I have learnt this also, that the brethren in Africa [95] did not
   introduce this practice (of re-baptism) now for the first time, but it
   was also adopted some time ago among our predecessors as Bishops, in
   the most populous churches and well-attended synods of the brethren,
   viz. in Iconium and Synnada, [96] and I cannot bring myself to reverse
   their decisions and involve them in strife and controversy. For "thou
   shalt not remove," it says, "thy neighbour's boundaries, which thy
   fathers set." [97]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [90] Dionysius seems to distinguish here two kinds of writings: (1)
   those that were based on systematic research and criticism, and (2)
   those that handed on the more traditional and less critical views and
   statements of the past.

   [91] Divine interposition is more vaguely suggested above on p. 44. S.
   Augustine's statement should also be compared, that at a critical
   moment of his conversion he heard a voice saying, "Take and read"
   (Conf. vii. 12, § 29); S. Polycarp likewise heard a voice from heaven
   saying, "Be strong and play the man," as he was led into the arena.

   [92] See Introduction, p. 11.

   [93] This is one of the more common apocryphal sayings usually
   attributed to our Lord: hence the epithet "apostolic" is somewhat
   strange.

   [94] The word for "Father" here is papas (pope), a colloquial form of
   pater applied to any bishop (or even to one of the inferior clergy
   sometimes) in the first ages. For Heraclas see p. 11. It is to be
   noticed, however, that this canon of his dealt not with heretical
   baptism (such as Dionysius is dealing with), but with actual or reputed
   perverts, and stated the terms on which they were to be restored to the
   Church of their baptism.

   [95] i. e. the Church in Africa Proconsularis, of which Carthage was
   the metropolis and Cyprian the metropolitan.

   [96] Iconium was the chief city of Lycaonia (see Acts xiii. and xiv.),
   and Synnada was an important town in Phrygia Salutaris. These synods
   had been held some twenty-five years before (in A.D. 230).

   [97] Deut. xix. 14.

  To Dionysius of Rome
  ([66]Eus., H. E. vii. 7, 6 and 8)
  (The fourth letter on Baptism)

   For with Novatian we are reasonably indignant, seeing that he has cut
   the Church in two and dragged certain of the brethren into impieties
   and blasphemies and introduced the most unholy teaching about God and
   accuses the most gracious Jesus Christ our Lord of being without pity,
   [98] and besides all this sets at nought the holy laws and overthrows
   the confession of faith before baptism, [99] and altogether banishes
   the Holy Spirit from them, even though there were some hope of His
   remaining or even of His returning to them. [100]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] See above, p. 53.

   [99] A confession of faith has always been required before baptism:
   this Novatian virtually ignored by his action.

   [100] Here as elsewhere Dionysius shows his breadth of view about God
   in recognizing that the Holy Spirit might in some measure remain even
   with the lapsed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Xystus (Sixtus) II, Bishop of Rome
  ([67]Eus., H. E. vii. 9)
  (The fifth about Baptism)

   I truly desire counsel, brother, and ask an opinion from you, being
   afraid lest after all I am wrong in my treatment of a case that has
   come before me as follows--

   One who is reckoned faithful among the brethren who meet together, of
   old standing, having been a member even before my ordination (as
   Bishop), and I fancy even before the appointment of the blessed
   Heraclas, had been present at a recent baptism and heard the questions
   and answers (in that service). He came to me weeping and bemoaning
   himself and falling at my feet, confessing and protesting that the
   baptism he had received among the heretics was not this, nor had
   anything in common with it: for that was full of impiety and
   blasphemies: [101] and he said that he was now sore pricked in the soul
   and had no courage even to lift up his eyes to God, because he had
   started with such unholy words and rites, and so he begged to obtain
   this thorough means of purification and acceptance and grace. But this
   I did not venture to do, saying that his so long being in communion
   with us was sufficient for the purpose. For as he had heard the Giving
   of Thanks (Eucharist) and joined in saying the Amen, [102] and stood
   [103] at the Table [104] and stretched forth his hands to receive the
   holy Food and had taken it and partaken of the Body and Blood of our
   Lord Jesus Christ for a considerable period, I should not venture to
   put him back to the beginning once more. So I bade him take courage and
   approach for the receiving of the Holy Things with sure faith and good
   hope. But he ceases not to grieve, and shrinks from approaching the
   Table and can with difficulty be persuaded to stand with (the
   Consistentes) [105] for the Prayers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] It is strange that so old a believer should never have noticed
   the difference before, but baptism was almost entirely confined at that
   time to Easter and Whitsuntide, and he may have always been absent.

   [102] Cp. 1 Cor. xiv. 16. The Amen is either that after the
   Consecration of the Elements or at the Reception of them.

   [103] "Standing" was, and is still, the posture in the East: Scudamore,
   Not. Euch., p. 637.

   [104] A somewhat rare word for "Altar" without some descriptive epithet
   like "holy" or "mystic."

   [105] The Consistentes were the last order of penitents, who were
   allowed to remain after the dismissal of the catechumens and other
   penitents, but did not join in the oblation or communion itself: cf.
   Canons of Nicæa, No. xi.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Conon [106]
  (Pitra, Spic. Sol. i. 15, from a Bodl. MS. dated 1062)

   As to those who are nearing the end of life, if they desire and beg to
   obtain absolution, having before their eyes the judgment to which they
   are departing, considering what is in store for them, if they are
   handed over thereto bound and condemned, and believing that they will
   gain relief and lightening of punishment there, if they be loosed
   here--for these the approval of the Lord is true and assured--these,
   too, it is part of the Divine mercy to send on their way free. If,
   however, they afterwards continue to live, it does not appear to me
   consistent to bind them again and load them with their sins. For when
   once absolved and reconciled to God, and pronounced again to be
   partakers of Divine grace and dispatched as free to appear before the
   Lord, [107] so long as nothing wrong has been done by them in the
   meantime to bring them back into bondage for their sins were most
   unreasonable. Shall we after that [108] impose on God the limits of our
   judgment, to be kept by Him while we observe them not ourselves, making
   parade of the goodness of the Lord [109] but withholding our own?
   Nevertheless if any one, after recovery, should show himself in need of
   further treatment, we counsel him, of his own accord, to humble and
   abase and lower himself, with a view to his own improvement and also to
   what is seemly in the eyes of the brethren and irreproachable before
   those without. [110] If he consent to this, he will be the gainer: but,
   if he should object and refuse, then no doubt that will be a sufficient
   ground for a second exclusion.

   [106] The letter from which this is supposed to be an extract is said
   by Eusebius (H. E. vi. 46, 2) to have been on the subject of

   he had given on p. 42 above.

   [107] Viz. under the impression that they were going to die.

  From the Writings about Repentance
  (Mai, Class. Auct. x. 484, from a Vat. MS.)

   But now we do the contrary. For him whom Christ in His goodness seeks
   when wandering upon the mountains, and calls to Himself when fleeing,
   and lays upon His shoulders when found at last, [111] him we resolutely
   repel when he approaches. Nay, let us not adopt so evil a counsel for
   our own sake, nor drive the sword into our own heart. For they that
   endeavour to injure or, on the other hand, to benefit others, may not
   altogether have the effect they desired upon them, but they do bring
   about good or evil for themselves and replenish their store either of
   heavenly virtues or of undisciplined affections. And these taking good
   angels as their companions and fellow-travellers, [112] both here and
   hereafter, in all peace and freedom from every evil, will be allotted
   the most blessed inheritances for eternity and will ever be with God,
   the greatest good of all; and those will forfeit at once the peace of
   God and their own peace, and both here and after death will be handed
   over to tormenting demons. Let us then not repel those who return, but
   gladly welcome them and number them with those who have not strayed,
   and thus supply that which is wanting [113] in them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] The reference is to Luke xv. 4 ff. and Ezek. xxxiv. 6, etc.

   [112] Dionysius is thinking perhaps of the story in Tobit v. 6, where
   Raphael becomes the companion of Tobit's son Tobias on his journey.

   all things" (1 Cor. xiii.): similar but not identical phrases (in words

   and Col. i. 24.

  To Domitius and Didymus
  ([68]Eus., H. E. vii. 11)
  (Part of an Easter Letter)

   (1) It is superfluous to mention by name the many members of our body,
   who are unknown to you: but you should know that men and women, young
   and old, soldiers [114] and civilians, every class and age, some by the
   scourge and fire and some by the sword have conquered in the fight and
   carried off their crowns, while with some even a very long period did
   not prove sufficient to show them acceptable to the Lord (as martyrs),
   as in fact seems to be the case even now with me. [115] Wherefore I
   have been put off until a time which He Himself knows to be the right
   one by Him who saith: "In a time acceptable I heard thee, and in the
   day of salvation I succoured thee." [116] For since you inquire and
   wish to be informed how we fare, by all means hear our experiences: how
   that when we were being led away prisoners by a centurion and duumviri
   [117] with their soldiers and servants, viz. myself and Gaius, Faustus,
   Peter and Paul, certain of the inhabitants of the Mareotis came upon
   us, and with violence dragged us off against our will and in spite of
   our protests. [118] And now I with Gaius and Peter only, deprived of
   the company of the other brethren, [119] am shut in a desolate and
   dreary part of Libya, three days' journey from Parætonium. [120]

   And further on he says--

   (2) In the city there have concealed themselves, secretly looking after
   the brethren, from among the presbyters Maximus, [121] Dioscorus,
   Demetrius and Lucius (for Faustinus and Aquila, who were better known
   in the world, are wandering in other parts of Egypt), and of the
   deacons Faustus, Eusebius and Chæremon, who survived those who perished
   in the pestilence. [122] Eusebius was he whom from the beginning God
   strengthened and inspired to perform many services for the confessors
   in prison with all energy, and to carry out at no small risk the last
   offices for the perfect [123] and blessed martyrs in decking out their
   bodies (for burial). For up till now the Prefect does not cease from
   cruelly slaying some of those who are brought before him, as I have
   already said, and from tearing others in pieces with instruments of
   torture, while he crushes the spirits of others again with chains and
   imprisonment, forbidding any to visit them and making search lest any
   should be found doing so. Nevertheless, God gives them some respite
   from their miseries through the zeal and steadfast efforts of the
   brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] The difficulties of soldiers becoming and remaining Christians
   were peculiarly great under the early Emperors.

   [115] That is, some had not yet been called upon to be actual martyrs,
   Dionysius among them who was still in exile.

   [116] Is. xlix. 8.

   [117] These were the same civil officials as those mentioned in Acts
   vi. 20 at Philippi, with their servants, there called lictors
   (rhabdouchoi): the soldiers belonged to the centurion, of course.

   [118] This has already been described on p. 44.

   [119] Including Timotheus who had been the means of his escape.

   [120] A town on the coast 150 miles west of Alexandria.

   [121] He and the three deacons have already been mentioned on p. 46.
   They must have left Dionysius when he went into exile and returned to
   Alexandria.

   [122] "In the island," according to Rufinus's version, but it is not
   clear what island he means: the pestilence is probably one of those
   frequent epidemics which devastated North Africa and other districts of
   the empire.

   [123] The epithet "perfect," though applied to believers generally in
   the New Testament (Matt. v. 28, etc.), was later specially used of
   martyrs.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Hermammon
  ([69]Eus., H. E. vii. 1, 10, 23)
  (Part of another Easter Letter)

   (1) Even Gallus [124] did not know the flaw in Decius's policy, nor did
   he foresee what it was that upset him, but stumbled over the same stone
   that was right before his eyes. For, though his reign was prospering
   and things were going according to his mind, he drove into exile the
   holy men who were interceding with God for his peace and health, with
   the effect that with them he drove out also their prayers on his
   behalf.

   So far on that point, and then again he discourses about Valerian in
   the same letter--

   (2) To John also it is revealed in like manner, when he says: "There
   was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy, and there
   was given him authority and forty-two months." [125] And both these
   things are to be wondered at in the case of Valerian, [126] and of them
   it is especially to be observed how his prosperity lasted so long as he
   was gentle and well-disposed towards the men of God. [127] For none of
   the Emperors before him were so kindly and favourably affected towards
   them, not even those who were said to have been openly Christians,
   [128] as he manifestly was, receiving them at the beginning in a most
   familiar and friendly spirit: indeed, his whole house was filled with
   devout persons and was a veritable Church of God. [129] But he was
   persuaded to abandon this treatment by that tutor and chief ruler of
   Egyptian magicians, [130] who instructed him to slay or persecute, as
   adversaries and hinderers of his vile and detestable sorcerers, the
   pure and holy persons, who are and were able to confound the devices of
   accursed demons by being present and seen and merely breathing on them
   and uttering words, [131] while he also incited him to perform unholy
   rites and detestable juggleries and abominable sacrifices such as the
   killing of wretched boys and the slaying of unhappy fathers' children
   and the dividing of new-born entrails asunder and the cutting up and
   mutilating of bodies which are God's creation, [132] in the hope that
   such doings would bring them Divine favour.

   And to this he adds as follows--

   (3) Fine offerings at all events did Macrianus make to them (sc. the
   demons) to propitiate them for the Empire which he hoped for, when, in
   his former position as so-called officer in charge of the Emperor's
   general (katholou) accounts he entertained no reasonable (eulogon) nor
   catholic (katholikon) sentiments, [133] but fell under the prophet's
   curse, who says: "Woe to those who prophesy out of their own heart and
   see not the general (to katholou) view." [134] For he did not
   understand the workings of Universal (katholou) Providence, [135] nor
   suspect the approach of Judgment on the part of Him who is before all
   things and through all things and over all things. [136] Wherefore he
   has become also the enemy of His universal (katholikes) Church and has
   alienated and estranged himself from God's mercy and banished himself
   as far as possible from his own salvation, verifying in this his
   personal name. [137]

   And again further on he says--

   (4) For Valerian, through being persuaded to this policy by him,
   exposed himself to insults and injuries according to that which was
   said to Isaiah: "And these men chose their ways and their abominations
   which their soul desired, and I will choose their mockings and will
   recompense them their sins." [138]

   But this man (Macrianus) in his mad lust after imperial power for which
   he had no qualifications, being unable to deck his own crippled body
   with the imperial robes, put forward his two sons, who thus became
   liable for their father's sins. [139] For the prophecy clearly applies
   to them which God spake: "visiting the sins of the fathers upon the
   children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."
   [140] For he brought upon his sons' heads his own evil desires in which
   he had succeeded and involved them in the consequences of his own
   wickedness and hatred of God. [141]

   Then there is a section in which he refers to the peaceful times under
   Gallienus--

   (5) So after thus inciting one of the Emperors before him and attacking
   the other, he speedily vanished with all his family, root and branch,
   [142] whilst Gallienus was proclaimed and acknowledged by all, being at
   once the old and the new Emperor, having preceded the usurpers and
   remaining after them. For, in accordance with that which was spoken to
   the prophet Isaiah, "behold the things predicted from the beginning
   have come to pass, and new things which will now arise." [143] For as a
   cloud having overcast the sun's rays and screened them for a while
   shades it and shows itself in its stead, and then when the cloud has
   passed off or been dissipated the sun which was shining before emerges
   and shines forth again, so it is with Macrianus; after coming forward
   and gaining access for himself to the imperial power which belonged to
   Gallienus, he ceases to be, since he was of no account, and the other
   resumes the position he had before. And the Empire, having cast off, as
   it were, its old age and purged itself of its former badness, now
   bursts into greater splendour, is seen and heard from afar and pervades
   the whole world.

   Then in due order he indicates the date of this letter in these words--

   (6) And once more it occurs to me to consider the days and years of
   this period of the Empire. For I observe that the ungodly persons (I
   have mentioned) after a short period of honourable mention have lost
   their good name, but (Gallienus) who was more righteous and loved God
   better, [144] having completed the seven years' period, is now passing
   through his ninth year: [145] therefore let us keep the Feast. [146]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] Gallus succeeded to the empire on the death of Decius and his
   sons in 251, and reigned till 253, when it was wrested from him by
   Æmilian, who was in turn ousted by Valerian after four months' rule.
   Dionysius makes no mention of this episode, though he does of Macrian's
   attempt later.

   [125] The quotation is from Rev. xiii. 5, but the last words follow a
   reading which has no support in the MSS. It should also be noticed that
   Dionysius does not think it at all certain that the author of the
   Revelation is the Evangelist: see p. 86.

   [126] Valerian reigned from 253 till his disappearance in 260. The
   duration of the persecution was forty-two months, from before midsummer
   257 till late in 260.

   [127] Here the expression means Christians generally, not prophets or
   clergy as often.

   [128] Alexander Severus and Philip the Arabian are no doubt meant.

   [129] Compare such expressions in S. Paul's letters as Rom. xvi. 5, 1
   Cor. xvi. 11, etc.

   [130] No doubt Macrianus is meant, who is mentioned further on, but it
   is difficult to account for the exact epithets which Dionysius here
   applies to him. Apparently he had been Valerian's tutor in some kind of
   magic, and had allied himself somehow with the Jewish colony in
   Alexandria (hence archisunagogos), who would, of course, be hostile to
   the Christians.

   [131] Christian exorcists must be meant, though the claim to
   supernatural powers which Dionysius makes for them is sufficiently
   remarkable.

   [132] This was a frequent charge against the Christians themselves.
   Here Dionysius turns it against their persecutors in Egypt.

   [133] It is very difficult, without a knowledge of Latin and Greek, to
   understand Dionysius's play on words throughout this section. The
   office which Macrianus held was that of, in Latin, Rationalis or
   Procurator summæ rei, in Greek ho epi ton katholou logon (something
   like our Chancellor of the Exchequer): hence Dionysius says he was not
   rational (or reasonable) in his treatment of the Christians and showed
   no catholic spirit towards them.

   [134] Ezek. xiii. 3. Dionysius takes the last phrase (to katholou), as
   if it was the object of the verb, not an adverb, in order to suit his
   argument.

   [135] This may perhaps mean that besides his other faults Macrianus was
   tainted with the atheistic views of the Epicureans, while Dionysius
   also alludes in this sentence to the accounts which Macrianus would
   have to present to the Emperor of his own administration.

   [136] Cf. Eph. iv. 6 and Col. i. 17.

   [137] Another play on words, as if Macrianus was derived from the Greek
   makros (far off), which is somewhat doubtful.

   [138] Is. lxvi. 3, 4 (LXX). Here the reference is to Valerian falling
   into the hands of Sapor, the Persian King, who inflicted grievous
   insults upon him, and kept him in captivity till his death.

   [139] Macrianus was lame of one leg. After Valerian's defeat and
   disappearance (in 260), for which he was himself largely responsible,
   Macrianus and his two sons, Macrianus junior and Quietus, made an
   abortive attempt to seize the throne, which was soon defeated.

   [140] Ex. xx. 5.

   [141] The two Macriani were defeated and slain by Aureolus, another
   usurper, in Illyricum, and Quietus was put to death in the East.

   [142] Dionysius is still speaking of Macrianus, who had incited
   Valerian to attack the Persians, and then had himself attacked
   Gallienus and tried to usurp the throne.

   [143] Is. xlii. 9, but Dionysius has substituted, for the last phrase,
   a phrase from xliii. 19. The original prophecy applies to the triumph
   of Cyrus and the conversion of the world to the worship of Jehovah. Its
   application in the text strikes us to-day as too fanciful.

   [144] Whether Gallienus himself was really a Christian is very
   doubtful, but his wife, Cornelia Salonina, seems to have been.

   [145] This is a very obscure calculation, but the upshot of it may be
   as follows: Gallienus was associated with his father Valerian as
   Emperor seven years (253-60), then Macrianus usurped the power (in
   Egypt) for one year, or rather more; thus Gallienus regained the power
   in his ninth year (i. e. after midsummer 261). Gallienus's original
   Edict of Peace was issued in Oct. 260, but the Rescript applying it to
   Egypt was delayed for some time. The Easter festival for which this
   letter was written, therefore, must have been that of 262.

  To the Brethren in Alexandria
  ([70]Eus., H. E. vii. 22)
  (Part of another Easter Letter)

   (1) Other men would not think the present a time for "keeping festival:
   nor, indeed, is this nor any other such a time to them; I speak not of
   times obviously sorrowful, but even of such as they might consider most
   joyful. In these days there are lamentations everywhere, and all are
   mourning: wailings resound through the city by reason of the number of
   the dead and the dying day by day. For, as it is written about the
   firstborn of the Egyptians, so now also "a great cry arose: for there
   is not a house in which there is not one dead." [147] I would, indeed,
   there were but one; for the things that have before now befallen us
   were truly many and grievous. [148] First of all they drove us into
   exile and we kept the feast then too by ourselves, persecuted and
   harried to death by all, and every place where each particular
   affliction befel us became the scene of our festal assembly, open
   country, desert, ship, inn or prison, and our perfect [149] martyrs
   spent the brightest of all feasts, being entertained in heaven above.
   But after this war and famine seized us, which we endured in common
   with the Gentiles, having undergone alone all the injuries they had
   inflicted on us and then having to share in the evils they wrought on
   one another and suffered: and once more we rejoiced in the peace of
   Christ, which He has given to us alone. But now after we and they had
   obtained a very brief respite, this pestilence has overtaken us, which
   is to them a more fearful thing than all former fears and more terrible
   than any calamity whatever, and to quote an expression of an historian
   of their own, [150] "a thing which alone has exceeded all men's
   expectation," while to us it was not so much that as a discipline and a
   testing no less severe than any of the rest: for it did not spare us,
   though it attacked the Gentiles in great force.

   To this he adds as follows--

   (2) At all events most of the brethren through their love and brotherly
   affection for us spared not themselves nor abandoned one another, but
   without regard to their own peril visited those who fell sick,
   diligently looking after and ministering to them and cheerfully shared
   their fate with them, being infected with the disease from them and
   willingly involving themselves in their troubles. Not a few also, after
   nursing others back to recovery, died themselves, taking death over
   from them and thus fulfilling in very deed the common saying, which is
   taken always as a note of mere good feeling; for in their departure
   they became their expiatory substitutes. [151] At all events, the very
   pick of our brethren lost their lives in this way, both priests and
   deacons and some highly praised ones from among the laity, so that this
   manner of dying does not seem far removed from martyrdom, being the
   outcome of much piety and stalwart faith. So, too, taking up the bodies
   of the saints on their arms and breasts, closing their eyes and
   shutting their mouths, bearing them on their shoulders and laying them
   out for burial, clinging to them, embracing them, washing them, decking
   them out, they not long after had the same services rendered to them;
   for many of the survivors followed in their train. But the Gentiles
   behaved quite differently: those who were beginning to fall sick they
   thrust away, and their dearest they fled from, or cast them half dead
   into the roads: unburied bodies they treated as vile refuse; [152] for
   they tried to avoid the spreading and communication of the fatal
   disease, difficult as it was to escape for all their scheming.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [147] Exod. xii. 30.

   [148] I have translated the Berlin editor's reading here, as being the
   least unsatisfactory of those proposed. Others give a text which may be
   rendered: "I would this were all: for the things that befell us before
   drove us into many grievous troubles." But the exact meaning is
   doubtful, however we take it.

   [149] This epithet for martyrs has already occurred on p. 64.

   [150] This is none other than a quotation from Pericles's speech about
   the plague at Athens in Thucyd. ii. 64, though in Dionysius's original
   phrase it sounds as if he meant some local minor historian.

   [151] The word Dionysius uses here is the same as S. Paul, uses (1 Cor.
   iv. 13: peripsema, offscouring). It is said to have been used at Athens
   of the human scapegoats thrown into the river in time of famine: "Be
   thou my expiation (peripsema)." Elsewhere it seems to have degenerated
   into a sort of extravagant compliment: "I am your humble servant
   (peripsema)." Dionysius suggests it might regain its more serious
   meaning in the present case.

   [152] Here again Dionysius uses an expression suggested by S. Paul in
   Phil. iii. 8.

  To Hierax an Egyptian Bishop
  ([71]Eus., H. E. vii. 21)
  (Part of another Easter Letter)

   But what is there surprising in its being difficult for me to
   correspond even by letter with those who are sojourning at a distance,
   seeing that it has proved impossible to talk even with myself and to
   take counsel with my own soul? At all events, with my own kith and kin,
   with the brethren of my own house and life, citizens of the same
   Church, I have to communicate by letters and to get them through seems
   impracticable. For it were easier for one to pass, I say not across the
   frontier, but even from East to West, than to visit one part of
   Alexandria from another. For that vast, pathless desert which it took
   Israel two generations to traverse is not so impassable and hard to
   cross as the central street of the city, nor is the sea, which they had
   for a carriage-road when the waters were parted asunder to make a
   passage through. And our still and waveless harbours [153] have become
   an image of those in the passing of which the Egyptians were
   overwhelmed; for they have often appeared like the Red Sea from the
   blood which was in them. And the river which flows past the city at one
   time appeared drier than the waterless desert and more parched than
   that which Israel crossed over when they were so thirsty that Moses
   cried out and drink flowed out of the steep rock from Him that worketh
   wonders: [154] and at another time it was so full as to overflow the
   whole neighbourhood, both roads and fields, and to threaten a return of
   the flood which occurred in the days of Noah. But in either case it
   runs polluted with blood and slaughter and drowned corpses, as under
   Moses it happened to Pharaoh, when the river turned to blood and stank.
   [155] And what other water could cleanse all this but the water which
   itself cleanseth all things? [156] How could the mighty ocean which man
   cannot cross, overspread and sweep away this horrid flood? or how could
   the great river that goeth out of Eden wash off the stain, though it
   were to divert the four heads into which it is divided into the single
   head of the Gihon? [157] or when would the air, reeking everywhere with
   the evil exhalation, become pure? For such mist from the ground and
   breezes from the sea, airs from the rivers and vapours from the
   harbours are given off that for dew we have the impure fluids of
   corpses rotting in all their component elements. After all this do men
   wonder, are they at a loss, whence come the continual pestilences,
   whence the dire diseases, whence the divers ravages, whence the
   wholesale destruction of life, why the largest city no longer contains
   in it its former multitude of inhabitants, from infant children to the
   most advanced in years, whom it used to nourish in other days to a
   green old age, [158] as the saying went, whereas these from forty up to
   seventy years of age were so much more numerous then that their number
   is not now reached even when all from fourteen to eighty are enrolled
   and put together for the public distribution of food, [159] and thus
   those whose looks show them to be quite young have become as it were of
   equal age with those who have long been advanced in years. And though
   they see the race of man on earth thus dwindling ever and being
   exhausted, they do not tremble, [160] as its total extinction proceeds
   and draws near.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] It is not clear whether Dionysius actually alludes here to the
   well-protected harbours of Alexandria or (more loosely) to the Lake
   Mareotis: probably to the former, because the canal he refers to in the
   next sentence (though he calls it a river) was cut from the Nile into
   one of the harbours and passed at the back of the city between it and
   the Lake Mareotis.

   [154] Cf. Ps. lxxvii. 13, cxxxvi. 4, and Wisd. xi. 4. The whole
   passage, of course, refers to Exod. xiv. and xvii.

   [155] Cf. Exod. vii. 20, 21.

   [156] i. e. if the biggest river and the ocean itself, as he proceeds
   exaggeratedly to claim, cannot do so, what other cleansing can there
   be?

   [157] Cf. Gen. ii. 10 ff. Dionysius evidently adopts the later Jewish
   view that the Gihon was the Nile, Æthiopia (or Cush) being identified
   with Egypt.

   [158] The meaning of the phrase employed by Dionysius here ("hale old
   men") comes from Homer, Il. xxiii. 791 (cf. Virg., Æn. vi. 304); but
   elsewhere a very similar phrase seems to suggest "a cruel, untimely old
   age."

   [159] Evidently at Alexandria (the capital of that country which was
   the chief granary of Rome) either the necessitous citizens or perhaps
   all between forty and seventy were entitled to receive doles of corn;
   but now the relief was extended to all ages between fourteen and
   eighty.

   [160] Either the heathen are meant, who ought to tremble and be
   convinced, or the Christians, who were too courageous through trust in
   God to tremble.

  (From another Easter Letter)

   [This fragment is given in the Sacra Parallela Rupefucald., fol. 70 and
   71, where it is ascribed to Dionysius's "Fourth Easter Letter." It is
   by no means clear which Letter is meant, but the main thought (of the
   cunning devices by which Love wins its way) is quaintly beautiful and
   well worthy of our author]

   Love leaps out in utmost eagerness to confer some benefit even on an
   unwilling object: yea, often on one who shrinks in shame and tries to
   shun kind treatment from dislike of being burdensome to another, and
   would fain put up with his annoyances alone, in order not to cause
   trouble and inconvenience to any. He that is full of Love craves leave
   to suffer and endure: to be in evil case, he thinks, gives opportunity
   for being helped, and he will do the greatest favour to another, not
   himself, if through that other the evil, which is his own, is made to
   cease. [161]

   paraphrase rightly expresses the thought.

  To Basilides, Bishop of the Churches in the Pentapolis (Cyrenaica)

   [This canonical Letter was accepted at the third Council of
   Constantinople in Trullo (A.D. 680)]

   Dionysius to Basilides my beloved son and brother and godly
   fellow-worker, greeting in the Lord.

   (1) You sent to me, my most faithful and learned son, to inquire at
   what hour one ought to end the fast before Easter. [162] For you say
   that some of the brethren maintain one should do so at cockcrow: [163]
   and some at evening. [164] For the brethren in Rome, so they say, await
   the cockcrow: but concerning those in the Pentapolis you said they
   broke the fast sooner. And you ask me to set an exact limit and a
   definite hour, which is both difficult and risky. For it will be
   acknowledged by all alike that one ought to start the feast and the
   gladness after the time of our Lord's resurrection, up till then
   humbling our souls with fastings. But by what you have written to me,
   you have quite soundly and with a good insight into the Divine Gospels
   established the fact that nothing definite appears in them about the
   hour at which He rose. For the Evangelists described those that came to
   the tomb diversely--that is, at different times, and all [165] said
   that they have found the Lord already risen: it was "late on the
   Sabbath day," as S. Matthew puts it: [166] and "early while it was yet
   dark," as S. John writes; and "at early dawn," as S. Luke; and "very
   early ... when the sun was risen," as S. Mark. And when He rose, no one
   has clearly stated; but that "late on the Sabbath day, as it began to
   dawn towards the first day of the week," about sunrise on that day
   those who arrived at the tomb found Him no longer lying in it, that is
   agreed to. And we must not imagine that the evangelists are at variance
   and contradict one another: but even if there seem to be some small
   dispute upon the matter of your inquiry--that is, if though all agree
   that the Light of the world [167] our Lord arose on that night, they
   differ about the hour, yet let us be anxious fairly and faithfully to
   harmonize what is said.

   What is said, then, by Matthew runs thus: "Late on the Sabbath day, as
   it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene
   and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great
   earthquake: for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and
   rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his appearance was as
   lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the
   watchers did quake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and
   said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus which
   hath been crucified. He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said."
   As to this word which he uses for "late," some will think, in
   accordance with its common acceptation, that the evening of the Sabbath
   is signified; but others, understanding it more scientifically, will
   say it is not that, but "the dead of night," the word used signifying
   an advanced stage of lateness. [168] And because he means night and not
   evening, he adds "as it began to dawn towards the first day of the
   week" and (the women) had not yet come, as the rest say, "bringing
   spices" but "to see the sepulchre." [169] And they found the earthquake
   had occurred and the angel seated on the stone, and heard from him the
   words: "He is not here: he is risen." Similarly, John says: "On the
   first day of the week came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark,
   unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb." However,
   by this account, "when it was still dark" although towards dawn, He had
   gone forth from the tomb. But Luke says: "On the Sabbath they rested
   according to the commandment. But on the first day of the week at early
   dawn (the women) came unto the tomb bringing the spices which they had
   prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb." "Early
   dawn" indicates, perchance, the morning light appearing before (the sun
   itself) on "the first day of the week." In consequence, it was when the
   Sabbath had now completely passed, with the night that followed, and
   when a new day was beginning that they came bringing the spices and
   ointments, by which time it is clear that He had risen long before. To
   this, also, corresponds what Mark says: "(The women) brought spices
   that they might come and anoint him. And very early on the first day of
   the week they come to the tomb, when the sun was risen." For he, too,
   says "very early," which is the same thing as "at early dawn": and he
   has added, "when the sun was risen." For their start and their journey
   began, it is clear, "at early dawn" and "very early": but they had gone
   on spending time both on the road and around the tomb until sunrise.
   And on this occasion also [170] the white robed young man says to these
   women: "He is risen: he is not here."

   As things stand thus, we pronounce this decision for those who inquire
   to a nicety at what hour or what half-hour, or quarter of an hour, they
   should begin their rejoicing at the Resurrection of our Lord from the
   dead: those who are premature and relax before midnight, though near
   it, we censure as remiss and wanting in self-restraint; for they drop
   out of the race just before the end, as the wise man says: "that which
   is within a little in life is not little." [171] And those who put off
   and endure to the furthest and persevere till the fourth watch, when
   our Saviour appeared to those who were sailing also, walking on the
   sea, [172] we shall approve as generous and painstaking. And those
   midway who stop as they were moved or as they were able, let us not
   treat altogether severely. For all do not continue during the six days
   of the fast either equally or similarly: [173] but some remain without
   food till cockcrow [174] on all the days, some on two, or three, or
   four, and some on none of them. And for those who strictly persist in
   these prolonged fasts and then are distressed and almost faint, there
   is pardon if they take something sooner. But if some, so far from
   prolonging their fast do not fast at all, but feed luxuriously during
   the earlier days of the week, and then, when they come to the last two
   and prolong their fast on them alone, viz. on Friday and Saturday,
   think they are performing some great feat by continuing till dawn, I do
   not hold that they have exercised an equal discipline with those who
   have practised it for longer periods. I give you this counsel in
   accordance with my judgment in writing on these points.

   [Three rulings follow on points which it is not necessary to set out
   here]

   (2) These answers I give you from respect for you, beloved, not because
   you were ignorant of the subjects of your inquiry but to render us of
   one mind and soul [175] with yourself, as indeed we are. And I have set
   forth my opinion for you to share not as a teacher but as it becomes us
   to discuss one with another in all simplicity: and when you have
   considered it again, my most sagacious son, you should write again and
   tell me whatever seems to you better or what you judge to be as I have
   said.

   I pray that you may prosper, my beloved son, as you minister to the
   Lord [176] in peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [162] I have adopted our modern mode of expression, but in the early
   Church Pascha was often used for the fast which receded Easter as well
   as for the feast itself, and that is how Dionysius uses it here.

   [163] i. e. at 3 a.m. on Easter Day, the traditional hour of our Lord's
   Resurrection, especially in the West.

   [164] i. e. at 6 p.m. on Easter Eve.

   [165] "All," i. e. "who came," or perhaps "all the four evangelists."
   The "difference" is not really confined to the time, but to the parties
   which came, the other devout women coming later than the two Marys.

   [166] The four references are to Matt. xxviii. 1, John xx. 1, Luke
   xxiv. 1, and Mark xvi. 2.

   [167] Cf. John ix. 5, etc.

   [168] The Council in Trullo (A.D. 680) accepted this second meaning and
   consented to Dionysius's ruling on the point raised without reserve.

   [169] Dionysius thinks that S. Matthew's account, with which S. John's
   tallies, speaks of the two Marys coming to look at the tomb about
   midnight on Easter eve or morning, while S. Luke and S. Mark mentioned
   certain women who arrived at the tomb somewhat later, when the sun had
   just risen, but one at least of the Marys mentioned by S. Matthew is
   identical with one of those mentioned by S. Mark and apparently by S.
   Luke. Possibly, however, Dionysius means that the two Marys took part
   in both visits to the tomb. Dr. Swete on S. Mark and Dr. Westcott on S.
   John should be consulted by any one who wishes to pursue the question
   further.

   [170] i. e. as on the former occasion mentioned by S. Matthew and S.
   Mark.

   [171] The author of this saying (which is equivalent to our proverb, "A
   miss is as good as a mile") is not known. Basil (de Baptism. ii. i)
   quotes something like it, but with a different turn, and he, too,
   attributes it to "one of our wise men," but perhaps he is only
   referring to Dionysius in this passage.

   [172] Cf. Matt. xiv. 26.

   [173] He means the six days of what we call Holy Week, but he gives no
   indication whether the Lenten fast was then confined to those days in
   Alexandria and the Pentapolis or lasted longer. By "equally" he
   proceeds to explain is meant the length of the fasting (six days or
   two, and so on), and by "similarly" the manner or degree of it (till
   cockcrow or till evening).

   [174] The verb used (hupertithenai, Lat. superponere, to exceed) is the
   technical one for this prolonged fast: the ordinary fast ended at 6
   p.m. and that of the station days (Wednesday and Friday) at 3 p.m.

   [175] Cf. 1 Pet. iii. 8 and Phil. ii. 20.

   [176] The expression comes from Acts xiii. 2, where, however, it
   describes a special act of worship rather than "ministering" in
   general.

TREATISES

  "On the Promises"
  ([72]Eus., H. E. vii. 24 and 25)

   (1) Seeing that they bring forward a composition of Nepos, [177] on
   which they rely too much as showing irrefutably that the Kingdom of
   Christ will be on earth, though I accept and love Nepos for many other
   things, his faith, his laboriousness, his study of the Scriptures, and
   the many psalms he has written, [178] by which already many of the
   brethren are encouraged, and though I hold him in all the greater
   respect because he has gone to his rest before us, yet the truth is so
   dear to me and to be preferred that I can indeed applaud and give my
   full assent to right propositions, but must examine and correct
   whatever appears to be unsoundly stated. And if he were still with us
   and propounding his views merely by word of mouth, a discussion without
   writing would have sufficed to persuade and convince our opponents by
   way of question and answer. But now that this writing of his is
   published, which many think most convincing, and certain teachers hold
   the law and the prophets of no account and have relinquished the
   following of the Gospels and depreciated the Epistles of the Apostles,
   while they parade the teaching of this book as if it were some great
   and hidden mystery and will not allow our simpler brethren to hold any
   high and noble opinion either about the glorious and truly Divine
   appearing of our Lord [179] or about our rising from the dead and our
   gathering together and being made like unto Him, [180] but persuade
   them to hope for mean and passing enjoyments like the present in the
   Kingdom of God, it is necessary that we also should discuss the matter
   with our brother Nepos as if he were still alive.

   Further on he adds--

   (2) So being in the district of Arsenoe, where, as you know, [181] this
   teaching prevailed long before, so that both schisms and the defection
   of whole churches have occurred, I called together the presbyters and
   teachers [182] among the brethren in the villages, such of the brethren
   as wished being also present, and invited them publicly to make an
   examination of the matter. And when some brought forward against me
   this book as an impregnable weapon and bulwark, I sat with them three
   days in succession from dawn till evening and tried to correct the
   statements made. During which time I was much struck with the
   steadiness, the desire for truth, the aptness in following an argument
   and the intelligence displayed by the brethren, whilst we put our
   questions and difficulties and points of agreement in an orderly and
   reasonable manner, avoiding the mistake of holding jealously at any
   cost to what we had once thought, even though it should now be shown to
   be wrong, and yet not suppressing what we had to say on the other side,
   but, as far as possible, attempting to grapple with and master the
   propositions in hand without being ashamed to change one's opinion and
   yield assent if the argument convinced us; conscientiously and
   unfeignedly, with hearts spread open before God, accepting what was
   established by the exposition and teaching of the holy Scriptures.

   At last the champion and mouthpiece of this doctrine, the man called
   Coracion, [183] in the hearing of all the brethren that were present
   agreed and testified to us that he would no longer adhere to it nor
   discourse upon it nor yet mention nor teach it, on the ground that he
   had been convinced by what had been said against it. And of the rest of
   the brethren some rejoiced at the conference and the reconciliation and
   harmonious arrangement which was brought about by it between all
   parties.

   Further on he says this about the Revelation of John--

   (3) Certain people [184] therefore before now discredited and
   altogether repudiated the book, both examining it chapter by chapter
   and declaring it unintelligible and inconclusive and that it makes a
   false statement in its title. [185] For they say it is not John's, no
   nor yet a "Revelation," because of the heavy, thick veil of obscurity
   which covers it: [186] and not only is the author of this book not one
   of the Apostles but he is not even one of the saints nor a churchman at
   all; [187] it is Cerinthus, [188] the founder of the heresy that was
   called Cerinthian from him, and he desired to attribute his own
   composition to a name that would carry weight. For the substance of his
   teaching was this, that Christ's Kingdom will be on earth, and he
   dreams that it will be concerned with things after which he himself,
   being fond of bodily pleasures and very sensual, hankered, such as the
   satisfying of his belly and lower lusts, that is eating and drinking
   and marrying and such means as he thought would provide him more
   decorously with these pleasures, feasts and sacrifices and the slaying
   of victims. I should not myself venture to reject the book, seeing that
   many brethren hold it in high esteem, but, reckoning the decision about
   it to be beyond my powers of mind, I consider the interpreting of its
   various contents to be recondite and matter for much wonder. For
   without fully understanding, I yet surmise that some deeper meaning
   underlies the words, not measuring and judging them by calculations of
   my own; but giving the preference to faith, [189] I have come to the
   conclusion that they are too high for me to comprehend, and so I do not
   reject what I have not taken in, but can only wonder at these visions
   which I have not even seen (much less understood).

   Besides this, after examining the book as a whole and showing that it
   is impossible to understand it in its literal sense, he proceeds--

   (4) So having completed practically the whole prophecy, the prophet
   [190] pronounces a blessing on those who keep it and indeed on himself
   also: for "blessed," saith he, "is he that observeth the words of the
   prophecy of this book and I John who saw and heard these things." [191]
   That he was called John, therefore, and that the writing is John's I
   will not dispute. For I agree that it is the work of some holy and
   inspired person but I should not readily assent to his being the
   Apostle, the son of Zebedee, the brother of James, whose is the Gospel
   entitled "According to John" and the General Epistle. [192] For I
   conclude that he is not the same (1) from the character of each, (2)
   from the style of the language and (3) from what may be called the
   arrangement of the book. For the Evangelist nowhere inserts his name
   nor yet proclaims himself either in the Gospel or in the Epistle....

   (5) But John nowhere speaks either in the first or in the third person
   about himself, whereas he that wrote the Revelation straightway at the
   beginning puts himself forward: "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which
   he gave him to show to his servants speedily, and he sent and signified
   (it) by his angel to his servant John who bare witness of the word of
   God and of his testimony, even of all things that he saw." [193]

   Then he also writes an Epistle: "John to the seven churches that are in
   Asia, grace to you and peace." [194] Whereas the Evangelist did not put
   his name even at the head of the Catholic Epistle but began with the
   mystery of the Divine revelation [195] without any superfluous words:
   "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
   seen with our eyes." [196]

   For it is over this revelation that the Lord also pronounced Peter
   blessed, saying: "Blessed art thou Simon bar Jona, because flesh and
   blood did not reveal it to thee, but my heavenly Father." [197] Nay,
   even in the second and third extant Epistles of John, short though they
   are, John does not appear by name but he writes himself "the elder"
   anonymously. Whereas our author did not even consider it sufficient to
   mention himself by name once and then proceed with his subject, but he
   repeats the name again, "I John, your brother and partaker with you in
   the tribulation and kingdom and in the patience of Jesus, was in the
   isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and the testimony of
   Jesus." [198] In fact, at the end also he says this: "Blessed is he
   that observeth the words of the prophecy of this book and I John who
   saw and heard these things." [199] That he which wrote these things,
   therefore, is John, we must believe as he says so: but which John is
   not clear. For he does not say, as in many places in the Gospel, that
   he is the disciple beloved of the Lord, nor the one that reclined on
   His breast, nor yet the brother of James, nor yet the one that was the
   eyewitness and hearer of the Lord. Surely he would have used one of the
   aforesaid descriptions, when desirous of clearly identifying himself.
   And yet he does nothing of the kind, but calls himself our brother and
   partaker with us, and witness of Jesus and blessed for the seeing and
   hearing of the revelations. I suppose that many bore the same name as
   John the Apostle, who by reason of their love towards him and from
   their admiration and emulation of him and desire to be loved by the
   Lord like him, were glad to bear the same name with him, even as many a
   one among the children of the faithful is called Paul or Peter. [200]
   There is then another John also in the Acts of the Apostles, the one
   called Mark whom Barnabas and Paul took with them and of whom it says
   again: "And they had John as their attendant." [201] But as to whether
   he is the writer, I should say no. For it is not written that he
   arrived in Asia with them, but "Paul and his company," it says, "set
   sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John departed from
   them and returned to Jerusalem." [202] And I think there was yet
   another among those who were in Asia, since they say there were two
   tombs in Ephesus and each of them are said to be the tomb of John.
   [203]

   Again, from the thoughts and from the actual words and their
   arrangement this John may be reasonably reckoned different from the
   other. [204] For the Gospel and the Epistle agree with each other and
   begin in a similar way. The one says "In the beginning was the Word:"
   and the other "That which was from the beginning." The one says "And
   the Word became flesh and tabernacled in us, and we beheld his glory,
   glory as of the Only-begotten from the Father:" the other uses the same
   or almost equivalent expressions, "That which we have heard, that which
   we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld and our hands handled
   concerning the Word of Life, and the Life was manifested." [205] For he
   starts in this way because he is dealing, as he shows in what follows,
   with those who say that the Lord has not come in the flesh. [206] For
   which reason he is careful to add also: "And we have seen and bear
   witness and announce unto you the eternal Life which was with the
   Father and was manifested unto us. That which we have seen and heard we
   announce also unto you." [207] He is consistent with himself and does
   not diverge from his own propositions, but treats them throughout under
   the same heads and in the same terms, of which we will briefly recall;
   for instance, the attentive reader will find in each book frequent
   mention of the Life, the Light, the turning from darkness, [208]
   constant reference to the Truth, Grace, Joy, the Flesh and the Blood of
   the Lord, the Judgment, the Forgiveness of sins, the Love of God
   towards us, the command to us to love one another and that we must keep
   all the commandments: again there is the conviction of the world, of
   the devil, of the antichrist, God's adoption of us as Sons, the Faith,
   which is everywhere required of us, the Father and the Son everywhere:
   and generally throughout in describing the character of the Gospel and
   the Epistle one and the same complexion is to be observed in both. But
   the Revelation is quite different from them, foreign, out of touch and
   affinity with them, not having, one might almost say, one syllable in
   common. The Epistle contains no reminiscence nor subject dealt with in
   the Revelation nor the Revelation in the Epistle (to say nothing of the
   Gospel), whereas Paul in his Epistles did give some indication even
   about those revelations which he has not actually described. [209]

   And yet once more one can estimate the difference between the Gospel
   and Epistle and the Revelation [210] from the literary style. For the
   first two books are not only written in irreproachable Greek, but are
   also most elegant in their phrases, reasonings and arrangements of
   expression. No trace can be found in them of barbarous words, faulty
   construction or peculiarities in general. For St. John seems to have
   possessed both words, the Lord having graciously vouchsafed them to
   him; viz. both the word and knowledge of the word of speech. [211] That
   this John had seen a Revelation and received knowledge and the gift of
   prophecy, [212] I do not deny, but I observe his dialect and inaccurate
   Greek style, which employs barbaric idioms and sometimes even faulty
   constructions, which it is not now necessary to expose. For I have not
   mentioned this in order to scoff, let no one think so, but simply to
   point out the dissimilarity of the writings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] Nepos had apparently been Bishop of Arsenoe in Egypt, and was the
   author of a work (Elenchos Allegoriston) putting forward grossly
   material views of the Millennium. Dionysius refuted it in a carefully
   prepared treatise in two books. This extract is from the second book,
   and deals chiefly with the authorship of the Revelation of St. John the
   Divine in a way very characteristic of his large-hearted and
   broad-minded spirit.

   [178] Or Dionysius may mean that he had encouraged the singing of the
   Psalms in service.

   [179] Cf. Tit. ii. 13, 2 Thess. ii. 8, etc.

   [180] The reference is to 2 Thess. ii. 1 and 1 John iii. 2.

   [181] It does not appear to whom Dionysius addressed this treatise, but
   he usually did address what he wrote to some particular person.

   [182] Here the two offices are conjoined as in 1 Tim. v. 17. The
   "teacher" as an officer of the Church is mentioned in several of the
   early Church Orders.

   [183] Nothing more is known of him: either he had succeeded to the
   leadership since the death of Nepos, or on this particular occasion
   took the lead.

   [184] The allusion is probably to Gaius of Rome and his school rather
   than to the Alogi, as they were called, of the East; but both these
   bodies were strongly opposed to Millenarian views.

   [185] If this refers to a formal division into chapters, it disappeared
   afterwards, for a new division was devised in the sixth century, on
   which our present system is partly based.

   [186] Dionysius plays here on the meaning of the Greek word for
   Revelation, apokalupsis, "unveiling." He is fond of such a device.

   [187] If that is the meaning of the words employed, then "saints"
   (hagioi) is not used in its New Testament sense for the "faithful"
   generally, but a distinction is made more like the later use of the
   word for those who attained higher saintliness than the rest; but
   perhaps the phrase for "churchmen" implies "clerical or ecclesiastical
   persons," and "saints" has its earlier sense.

   [188] Cerinthus was the earliest exponent of Gnostic views, and as such
   much abhorred by St. John the Apostle.

   [189] i. e. reckoning that it is a matter where faith rather than
   reason should act; or perhaps the translation should be "giving more
   weight to (the author's) trustworthiness."

   [190] This title is to be noticed, as the author himself never actually
   describes himself by it. Dionysius is much more cautious as to the
   authorship than Origen, his former master, who attributed the book to
   St. John the Evangelist without hesitation, according to Eusebius, H.
   E. vi. 25, 9.

   [191] Rev. xxii. 7, 8: but Dionysius has no authority for joining the
   latter clause on to the former, its construction being "it is I John
   who saw and heard."

   [192] i. e. the First Epistle of St. John; the second and third were
   not so described at first and rightly so.

   [193] Rev. i. 1, 2. One might almost think Dionysius was quoting from
   memory, for he follows no extant text in omitting "God" before "gave"
   (thus making Jesus Christ the subject and "him" = "to John") and "the
   things which must come to pass" before "speedily": also he substitutes
   "his testimony" for "the testimony of Jesus Christ," though "his" still
   = "Jesus Christ."

   [194] Rev. i. 4.

   [195] Dionysius seems to contrast the "Divine revelation" of the
   Epistle which we can trust with that of the Book so-called about which
   he felt less sure.

   [196] 1 John i. 1.

   [197] Matt. xvi. 17. Dionysius substitutes the adjective "heavenly" for
   "which is in heaven."

   [198] Rev. i. 9. Here again the text is somewhat inaccurate "in the
   patience of Jesus" having no support elsewhere.

   [199] Rev. xxii. 7. See note on p. 86, above.

   [200] It would seem likely, but by no means certain, that Dionysius is
   speaking of strictly baptismal names here. We have very slight grounds
   for being sure that the custom of connecting the giving of a name at
   baptism was universal as early as this.

   [201] See Acts xii. 25 and xiii. 5.

   [202] Ibid., xiii. 13.

   [203] This assertion is taken almost verbatim from Eus., H. E. iii. 39,
   where a passage is also quoted from Papias in which John the Elder is
   mentioned as well as John the Apostle among the Lord's disciples.

   [204] This is the second argument which Dionysius adduces, but he seems
   as if he now includes the third with it. See above.

   [205] John i. 1, and 1 John i. 1, 2.

   [206] Cf. 1 John iv. 2.

   [207] Ibid., i. 2, 3.

   [208] It looks as if this phrase may be a marginal gloss on the Light,
   which has crept into the text, as it occurs nowhere in the writings of
   St. John nor elsewhere in the New Testament; but the same might be said
   of the "adoption" below, and one or two others of the other phrases are
   quite rare in St. John's writings, so that they may be all instances of
   the thoughts, not the words being identical in the two books.

   [209] The reference is to such passages as 2 Cor. xii. 1 ff., Gal. i.
   12, ii. 2, etc.

   [210] This is the third argument.

   [211] A rather forced and fanciful statement. Dionysius appears loosely
   to refer to 1 Cor. xii. 8, somewhat boldly substituting "of speech"
   (tes phraseos) for St. Paul's "of wisdom."

   [212] Cf. 1 Cor. xiv. 6 and 8.
     __________________________________________________________________

  "On Nature"
  (Eus., Præp. Evang. xiv. 23-7)

   (1) How shall we bear with them when they say that the wise and, for
   that reason, the good productions of Creation are the results of chance
   coincidences? [213] Each of which as it came into being by itself
   appeared to Him that ordered it to be good and all of them together
   equally so.

   For God "saw," it says, "all things that he had made, and behold they
   were very good." [214] And yet they take no warning from the small,
   ordinary instances at their feet, from which they may learn [215] that
   no necessary and profitable work is produced without design or
   haphazard, but is adapted to its proper purpose by handiwork, whereas
   when it falls into a useless and unprofitable state, it then breaks up
   and comes to pieces indefinite, and, as it chances, because the wisdom
   which was concerned in its construction no longer superintends and
   directs it. For a garment is not woven by the woof standing up without
   a weaver, nor yet by the warp weaving itself of its own accord: but
   when it is becoming worn out, the torn rags fall asunder. And a house
   or a city is built not by receiving certain stones which volunteer for
   the foundations and others which jump into the courses of the walls,
   but because the builder brings the stones that fit in the proper order:
   but when the building is thrown down, each stone falls to the ground
   just as it may. So, too, when a ship is being built, the keel does not
   set itself below, while the mast raises itself in the middle and each
   of the other timbers takes the place which it chances to of itself.
   Nor, again, do the planks of a wagon--said to be 100 [216] in
   number--become fixed in the position which each found empty; but the
   builder in each case puts the timber together suitably. But if the
   ship, when it went upon the sea, or the wagon, when it was driven along
   on land, comes to pieces, the timbers are scattered wherever it may
   happen--in the one case by the waves, in the other by the violent rush.

   In the same way it would befit them to say that the atoms also which
   are inoperative when they are at rest and not worked by hands, are also
   useless when they move at random. [217] For let these opponents of ours
   look to these viewless atoms of theirs and apply their minds to these
   mindless ones, not like the Psalmist who confesses that this was
   revealed to him by God alone: "Mine eyes beheld thy unfinished work."
   [218] So, too, when they say that those fine webs which they speak of
   as being produced from atoms, are self-wrought by them without skill or
   sensation, who can bear to hear of these weaver atoms whom even the
   spider excels in skill when he spins his web out of himself. [219]

   (2) Who, then, is it that discriminates between the atoms, gathering or
   scattering them, and arranging some in this way to make the sun and
   others in that way for the moon, and putting each of them together
   according to the light-giving power of each star? For the particular
   number and kind that made the sun by being united in a particular way
   would never have condescended to produce the moon, nor would the
   intertwinings of the moon atoms have ever become the sun. Moreover,
   even Arcturus, bright as he is, would never plume himself on having the
   atoms of Lucifer, nor the Pleiads those of Orion. For Paul has well
   distinguished when he says: "There is one glory of the sun, and another
   glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth
   from star in glory." [220] And if the combination of the atoms, as
   being soulless, was unintelligent, they needed an intelligent artist to
   put them together: and if their junction was without purpose and the
   result of necessity, they being void of reason, some wise herdsman
   drove them together and presided over them: and if they have been
   linked together voluntarily to do willing service, some wonderful
   master-craftsman assigned them their parts and took the lead; or, like
   an expert general, he did not leave his army disordered and all in a
   muddle, but disposed the cavalry in one part and the heavy armed troops
   apart, and the javelin men by themselves and the slingers where they
   ought to be, in order that those who carried the same weapon might help
   one another. And if they think this illustration ridiculous because in
   it I make a comparison of great bodies with small, we will come down to
   the very smallest.

   [Eusebius's extract breaks off here.]

   (3) If the atoms have no ruler over them, to speak to them or to choose
   or to arrange them, but they move, settling themselves of their own
   accord out of the big rushing tumult and producing a big uproar as they
   clash together, like coming to like without the Divine intervention of
   which the poet speaks, [221] and if they run and herd together,
   recognizing their kinsfolk, truly the republic of the atoms is a
   marvellous one, friends greeting and embracing one another and hasting
   to take up their abode in one habitation: some have rounded themselves
   off spontaneously into the sun, that mighty orb, that they may produce
   the day, and some perchance have flared up into the many pyramids [222]
   of stars that they may encircle the whole expanse of sky, while others
   are ranged around it, in order that they may--albeit undesignedly--form
   the firmament [223] and arch the atmosphere over for the graduated
   ascent of the stars, and that the confederation of these helter-skelter
   atoms may choose their abodes and apportion the sky as homes and
   stations for themselves.

   (4) So far are these deniers of Divine Providence from comprehending
   the invisible parts of the universe that they do not even see what is
   visible. For they appear not even to consider the ordered risings and
   settings of the sun, conspicuous though they be, let alone those of the
   other heavenly bodies; nor yet to appreciate the assistance thus given
   to mankind through them, the day being lighted up for work and the
   night being darkened for rest. For man shall go forth, it says, to his
   work and his labour until the evening. [224] But they do not even take
   note of its other [225] revolution, by which it brings about the fixed
   times and fair seasons and the regular winter and summer solstices,
   under guidance of its component atoms. Yet however much these poor
   creatures dislike it, it is as the righteous [226] believe: Great is
   the Lord that made him: and at His word he hasteneth his course. [227]
   Do atoms, ye blind, bring you winter and rains, in order that the earth
   may produce food for you and all the animals upon it? do they introduce
   summer that ye may receive for your enjoyment the fruits of the trees
   also? then why do you not bow down and sacrifice to the atoms that are
   the guardians of earth's fruits? ungrateful truly ye are, never
   offering them the smallest firstfruits of the many gifts ye have from
   them.

   (5) The many-tribed and much-mixed populace of the stars which the
   much-roving and ever-scattered atoms composed have (they say)
   apportioned among themselves their places according to agreement,
   setting up, as it were, a colony or a community, [228] without any
   founder or controller taking the lead over them: and they observe the
   duties of neighbourliness to one another by compact and peacably, not
   transgressing the original bounds which they accepted, as if they were
   under the jurisdiction of such atoms as had regal power. But the atoms
   do not rule; how could they, being of no account? Nay, listen to the
   Divine announcement (logia): "In the judgment of the Lord are his works
   from the beginning; and from the making of them he disposed the parts
   thereof. He garnished his works for ever and the beginnings of them
   unto their generation." [229]

   (6) What well-ordered phalanx ever traversed an earthly plain, no one
   stepping in front of others, nor falling out of the ranks, nor
   obstructing his comrades, nor falling behind them, in the way that the
   stars advance ever in regular order, shield locked in shield--that
   continuous, unwavering, unencumbered and unembarrassed host? Yet
   certain obscure deviations (we are told) arise among them through
   clashings and sideward motions: [230] and that they who devote
   themselves to their study can always tell the seasons and foresee the
   positions at which they will rise. Let, then, these cutters [231] of
   the uncuttable and dividers of the indivisible and combiners of the
   uncombined and discerners of the infinite tell us by what means occurs
   the encompassing journey round the heavens in company? it cannot be
   because a single combination of atoms has been without purpose hurled
   as from a sling in this way, seeing that the whole encircling band goes
   on its regular rhythmic way and whirls around together; by what means
   those multitudinous fellow-voyagers proceed in company albeit they are
   without arrangement or purpose and unknown to one another? Well did the
   prophet include amongst things impossible and undemonstrable that two
   strangers should run in company: Shall two walk at all together, he
   says, unless they are acquainted? [232]

   (7) (That to work is not toilsome to God.)

   To work and to administer and to benefit and to provide and the like
   are perchance vexatious to the idle and thoughtless and feeble and
   iniquitous, amongst whom Epicurus enrolled himself, when he conceived
   such ideas about the gods. But to the earnest and capable and
   intelligent and sober-minded, such as those who love wisdom (or
   philosophers) ought to be (and how much more the gods?), they are not
   only not unpleasing and irksome but rather most delightful and of all
   things most agreeable; for negligence and delay in doing something
   useful is a reproach to them, as the poet [233] warns them, [234] when
   he counsels: "Put not off till the morrow," and further threatens them:
   "He that procrastinates hath ever to struggle against disasters," while
   the prophet [235] instructs us still more solemnly when he says that
   virtuous deeds are truly godlike, but he that despises them is
   detestable: "for," saith he, "cursed be he that doeth the works of the
   Lord negligently." Consequently, while those who are untaught in any
   craft and are imperfect from want of practice and familiarity with the
   processes do find toil involved in their endeavours, those who make
   progress in it, and still more those who have reached perfection, are
   cheered by their easy success in what they aim at, and would rather
   accomplish and bring to completion the tasks they are accustomed to
   than have all the good things of mankind. At all events, Democritus
   himself, so they say, used to maintain that he would rather discover a
   single reason for a fact than gain the Persian kingdom; [236] and that
   though he seeks his reasons so vainly and unreasonably, starting as it
   were from a void beginning and a roving hypothesis and not observing
   that fundamental Necessity [237] which is common to the nature of
   things existent, but considering his conception of senseless and
   mindless contingencies to be the highest wisdom of setting up Chance as
   the mistress and queen of things universal and even of things divine,
   and maintaining that all things occur through her, and yet warning her
   off from matters of human life and conduct and accusing those who give
   her precedence there to be devoid of judgment. At all events, at the
   beginning of the "Precepts," [238] he says: "Men have fashioned the
   figure of Chance, as a cloke for their own folly: for by nature chance
   fights against judgement." Thus they (the Epicureans) have said that
   this very Chance, the great enemy of intelligence, yet has the mastery
   over it; or, rather, by utterly uprooting and abolishing the one, they
   set up the other in its place: for they sing not of intelligence as
   happy, but of chance as the equivalent of intelligence. [239] So, then,
   those who superintend works of beneficence pride themselves in measures
   which advance the interests of their kind, some as rearers of families,
   some as directors of institutions, some as healers of men's bodies,
   some as ministers of state, yes, and those who love wisdom
   (philosophers) and try hard to instruct their fellows, likewise give
   themselves great airs--unless Epicurus or Democritus will venture to
   maintain that philosophizing is mere vexation of spirit: but surely
   there is no pleasure they would prefer to it. For even though they
   reckon pleasure to be the absolute good, yet they will be ashamed to
   say that to philosophize (seek wisdom) is not one of the higher forms
   of pleasure. [240] And as to the gods, about whom the poets among them
   sing as "givers of good gifts" [241] and these philosophers combine
   respect with banter,--the gods neither give nor partake of any good
   things. And in what manner do they find evidence that gods exist? for
   they do not see them before their eyes doing anything (even as those
   who admired the sun and the moon and the stars said they were called
   gods (theoi) because they run (theein) their course); nor do they
   attribute to them any creative or constructive powers, in order that
   they make them gods from the word theinai (set, i. e. make): [242] and
   on that ground the Maker and Creator of all things is truly the only
   God; nor do they put forward their management or jurisdiction or
   favours towards men, in order that we may be induced to worship them
   from motives of fear or reverence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213] i. e. the results not of design but of the fortuitous
   intersection of lines of causation.

   [214] Gen. i. 31.

   [215] The argument appears to be that, as on a small scale design is
   "evident in the construction or repairing of a thing but is absent in
   its decay," so the orderly creation and maintenance of the Universe on
   the large scale implies intelligent direction.

   [216] Hesiod (Works and Days, 554) is meant, but of course 100 stands
   here, as elsewhere, for an indefinitely large number.

   [217] The point is that movement which is useful suggests design: but
   as the movement of the atoms is without design, it cannot be useful.

   [218] Ps. cxxxviii. (cxxxix.) 16. Dionysius quotes the best text here
   of LXX, but his application is rather obscure. Apparently he means that
   the Epicureans claimed to know without either revelation or research
   what the Psalmist knew only by revelation from God.

   [219] Dionysius says that even the spider has more notion of design
   than the atoms, but the sarcasm is not quite to the point.

   [220] 1 Cor. xv. 41.

   [221] "God ever brings like to like."--Homer, Od. xvii. 218, a proverb
   quoted both by Plato and Aristotle.

   [222] Dionysius is probably thinking of Plato's Timæus 56B, where the
   pyramid is said to be the geometrical shape of fire which is the
   principal constituent of the bodies of the stars (Professor H.
   Jackson).

   [223] Dionysius is here referring to such a passage as Gen. i. 6 ff. No
   doubt the ancients thought the vault of heaven was solid, enclosing the
   atmosphere which covers the earth, and that the stars were either fixed
   upon it or moved in their courses on its surface.

   [224] Ps. civ. 23.

   [225] i. e. the sun's yearly (as opposed to its daily) course.

   [226] "The righteous" here is a very unusual equivalent for "the
   Christians": it is possible, however, that the translation is: "however
   much these men disagree, being but poor creatures, though righteous
   enough in their own estimate."

   [227] Ecclus. xliii. 5.

   [228] The idea is of some stars being solitary, like a Greek or Roman
   colony (apoikia) with a constitution of its own, and of others grouping
   themselves into constellations or communities (sunoikia). The colony
   had a founder (oikistes), the community or household would have some
   sort of controller (oikodespotes).

   [229] Ecclus. xvi. 26 f.

   [230] The natural motion of atoms was downwards, but there was also a
   slight sideward motion, and when they impinged a motion upwards by
   blows and tossings, and this produced the shape of things. But
   Dionysius here says, how is that theory consistent with the orderly
   march of the stars?

   [231] Dionysius here plays on the derivation of atomoi, from temnein (=
   to cut).

   "agreed" to the last word.

   [234] Viz. the heathen, to whom the poets were to some extent what the
   prophets are to us Christians.

   [235] Jer. xlviii. 10.

   [236] The happiness of the King of Persia was proverbial: see Hor., Od.
   ii. 12, 21, iii. 9, 4.

   [237] By "Necessity" here Dionysius means not "Fate" in the fatalist's
   sense, but that supreme Will and Purpose of God, which is opposed to
   the Epicurean doctrine of chance.

   [238] The title here given (hupothekai) is not given in the list of
   Democritus's works, but the hupomnemata ethika may be meant.

   [239] It is impossible to reproduce the play upon words here, eutuche
   ten phronesin, emphronestaten ten tuchen. The reference seems to be to
   such poetical passages as Soph., O. T. 977 ff., and Eur., Alc. 785 ff.,
   where the practical wisdom of leaving the future to take care of itself
   is extolled.

   [240] Epicurus himself contended that by hedone (pleasure) he meant not
   sensual enjoyments so much as freedom from pain of body and from
   disturbance of soul (ataraxia), the source of which was largely in the
   exercise of the mind and will: see Zeller, Stoics, Epicureans and
   Sceptics, pp. 473 ff.

   [241] The words quoted (doteras eaon) are a Homeric phrase, e. g. Od.
   viii. 325 and 335.

   [242] The derivation from theein is proposed by Plato, Cratyl. 397 C:
   that from theinai by Herod, ii. 52, and of the two the latter is the
   more likely (?the) though Curtius suggests a root thes = to pray: see
   Peile, Introd. to Philology, p. 37 (3rd ed., 1875).

  "Refutation and Defence"
  (Eus., Præp. Evang. vii. 19)

   (1) They are not pious, who hand over matter to God as a thing without
   beginning for His orderly disposition, [243] maintaining that, being
   subject to treatment and change, it yields to the modifications imposed
   by God. For they should explain how both the like and the unlike belong
   both to God and to matter. For some one must be imagined superior to
   either, [244] and that may not be entertained about God. For whence
   came it that there is in them both the being without beginning, which
   is what is said to be "like" in both and which is also conceived of as
   different from both? [245] For if God is of Himself without beginning
   and the being without beginning is, as some would say, His very
   essence, matter will not be without beginning, too: for matter and God
   are not identical. But, if each is what it is independently, and to
   both belongs in addition the property of being without beginning, it is
   clear that the being without beginning is different from either and
   older and higher than both. And thus the difference between their
   opposing states is entirely subversive of their co-existence, or rather
   of the one, viz. matter existing of itself. Otherwise let them state
   the reason why, both being without beginning, God is not subject to
   treatment, unchangeable, immovable, productive, and matter is the
   opposite, subject to treatment, changeable, mobile, varying.

   Again, how is it that God and matter came in contact and combined? Was
   it that God adapted Himself to match the nature of matter and exercised
   His craft upon it? Nay, that is absurd that God, like men, should work
   in gold and stone and busy Himself in the other handicrafts which the
   various materials can give shape and form to. [246]

   But if God endowed matter with the qualities which He in His own wisdom
   determined, impressing on it as with a seal the multiform and diverse
   shape and fashion of His own workmanship, this account of it is both
   proper and true, and yet further proves that God, who is the
   fundamental principle on which the universe exists, is without
   beginning. For to its being (according to them) without beginning God
   add its bearing certain qualities. So, then, there is still much to be
   said in answer to these views, but we do not propose to say it now.
   Nevertheless they are expressed with more propriety than those who are
   absolutely atheistical polytheists. [247]

   (2) (Athan., de sent. Dion., 18). However, when I spoke of certain
   things that had an origin (geneta) and certain things that were made
   (poieta), I did indeed casually mention examples of such things,
   recognizing that they were not altogether useful for my purpose: for
   instance, I said that neither was the plant the same as the husbandman,
   nor the boat as the shipwright. But afterwards I dwelt at length on
   those which were more to the point and cognate to the subject, and went
   more into detail about these truer examples, seeking out various
   additional evidences which I set out for you [248] also in another
   letter: and in them I refuted as false the accusation also which they
   bring against me, as not stating that Christ is of one substance
   (homoousios) [249] with the Father. For even if I say [250] that this
   word is not found nor read anywhere in Holy Writ, yet these later
   attempts of mine to explain which they have ignored are not
   inconsistent with this conception. For I compared human generation,
   which is clearly a transmission of the parents' own nature (homogenes),
   saying that the parents were different from their children in this
   single point, that they were not themselves the children: or else it
   must needs be that neither parents nor children should exist. The
   letter itself I cannot, as I have said before, owing to circumstances,
   [251] lay my hand on: otherwise I would have sent you my exact words,
   or rather a copy of the whole letter: and I will do so, if I have the
   opportunity. But I know from memory that I added several illustrations
   from things kindred to one another: for instance, I said that a plant
   coming up from a seed or a root was different from that whence it
   sprang and yet was absolutely of one nature (homophues) with it: and a
   river flowing from a source partakes of a different shape and name; for
   neither is the source called river nor the river source, and both these
   things exist, [252] and the source is, in a sense, the father and the
   river is the water from the source. But these and similar remarks they
   pretend never to have seen written, but act as if they were blind. They
   only try to pelt me from afar [253] with those poor ill-fitting phrases
   of mine [254] as with stones, failing to recognize that where a subject
   is obscure and requires to be brought within our understanding, not
   only do diverse but even quite contradictory illustrations convey the
   meaning sought for.

   (3) (Ibid., 17.) It has been already said that God is the Fountain of
   all good things: and the Son is described [255] as the stream flowing
   forth from Him. For the Word is "the effluence" of mind, and, to use
   human phraseology, is conveyed from the heart through the mouth, i. e.
   the mind that finds expression by means of the tongue, being
   differentiated from the word in the heart. For the one having sent it
   forth remains and is still what it was; but the other being sent forth
   issues and is carried in all directions: and thus each is in each,
   being different one from the other: and they are one, being two. And it
   was in this way that the Father and the Son also were said to be one
   and in one another. [256]

   Each of the titles employed by me is indivisible and inseparable from
   its neighbour. I spoke of the Father, and before introducing the Son I
   implied Him, too, in the Father. I introduced the Son: even if I had
   not already mentioned the Father He would, of course, have been
   presupposed in the Son. I added the Holy Spirit: but at the same time I
   intimated both from Whom and through Whom [257] He came. But they are
   not aware that the Father is not separated from the Son qua Father--for
   the title (Father) is suggestive of such connexion (as Son with
   Father)--nor is the Son cut off from the Father; for the appellation
   "Father" denotes their common bond. And the Spirit is the object of
   their dealings, [258] being incapable of desertion by either Him that
   sends, or Him that conveys. How then can I, who use these titles, hold
   that They are wholly divided and separated? [259]

   (4) (Ibid., 23). For, as our mind overflows with speech [260] of
   itself, as says the prophet: "My heart overfloweth with good speech,"
   [261] and each is diverse from the other, each occupying its proper
   place distinct from the other, the one dwelling and moving in the heart
   and the other on the tongue and in the mouth, and yet they are not
   entirely unconnected nor deprived of one another; the mind is not
   speechless, nor the speech mindless, but the mind produces the speech,
   revealing itself thereby; and the speech shows the mind, having been
   gendered therein; the mind is, as it were, the inlying speech and the
   speech is the issuing mind; the mind is transferred into the speech and
   the speech displays [262] the mind to the hearers; and thus the mind
   through the speech gains a lodgment in the souls of those that hear,
   entering together with the speech, and the mind is, as it were, the
   father of the speech, having an independent existence withal; and the
   speech is, as it were, the son of the mind, being an impossibility
   prior to the mind, yet brought into association with it from any
   outside source, but springing from the mind; even so the Father, who is
   the Almighty and Universal Mind, has the Son, the Word as the
   Interpreter and Messenger of Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [243] These are probably some sort of Gnostics who took over Manichean
   views of God and Matter, but not of the worst kind, for they recognized
   that God had the control and disposition of matter.

   [244] Some one, i. e. who could give them the property of being without
   beginning.

   [245] "Different from both," because the being without beginning is not
   of the very essence of both. See further on.

   [246] A curious expression, for which one would have expected the
   opposite statement, viz. that the handicrafts can shape and form the
   materials they deal with rather than that the materials give the
   necessary methods and designs to the handicrafts which deal with them.
   Up to this point Dionysius has been combating the view with which the
   extract begins. The rest of the extract proceeds to show what amount of
   truth there is in it.

   [247] The reference here is to Manichean views of the worst kind, i. e.
   that matter is not only without beginning, but the source of evil and
   altogether independent of God.

   [248] i. e. Dionysius of Rome, to whom this treatise was addressed.
   This particular "other letter" does not seem to have been known to
   Eusebius, and when Athanasius quotes this extract in another of his
   treatises he omits the words "to thee."

   [249] Athanasius himself was sparing in his use of the term, and the
   Synod of Antioch (A.D. 264) refused to accept it, as liable to
   misconstruction.

   [250] i. e. in the letter to Euphranor (about Sabellianism in Libya)
   which had given rise to the Bishop of Rome's intervention.

   [251] It looks as if Dionysius was in exile when he wrote this. See
   above, p. 19.

   [252] i. e. each of the two is itself and not the other, as was said
   above in the case of parents and children.

   [253] i. e. they had gone or sent to Rome, in order to attack him.

   [254] Viz. about the plant and the ship, which he has already
   apologized for as not quite appropriate.

   [255] i. e. in Scripture, e. g. in such passage as Wisd. vii. 25, to
   which he refers in the next sentence.

   [256] Sc. in Dionysius's letter to Euphranor: cf. John x. 30, xvii. 11,
   21, 22. The extract on p. 106 below deals with the same thought more
   fully. In both places Dionysius's language is based on Philo's
   discussion of the logos endiathetos and the logos prophorikos (the
   conceived and the expressed word), de vita Mosis, p. 230, Cohn.

   [257] i. e. from the Father and through the Son: Dionysius seems to
   have derived this view of the Holy Spirit's Procession from his master,
   Origen, though he is thinking here rather of the Mission of the Spirit
   into the Church and its members than of the eternal and necessary
   relations of the three Persons in the Holy Trinity to one another, as
   the sentences that follow indicate.

   [258] Lit. in their hands: a striking expression which Athanasius
   borrows from Dionysius in his Exposition of the Faith.

   [259] This is what Dionysius of Rome had imputed to our Dionysius,
   though without the word "wholly" he would not have altogether discarded
   the position.

   [260] Logos is translated throughout this passage by "speech" (i. e.
   uttered words), except in the last clause, where it refers to the Son
   Himself and where it must be rendered by "Word" as usual: but obviously
   "speech" is only part of the full meaning of logos. The whole passage
   should be compared with the preceding extract.

   [261] Ps. xliv. (xlv.) 1: here R.V. translates logon agathon, "a goodly
   matter," in accordance with A.V.

   [262] The word used (enkuklein) suggests the scenic device of the
   enkuklema, by which some kind of change of scene was brought on to the
   stage in the Greek theatre: see Classical Dict., s.v.

Additional Note to [73]p. 12.

   Jerome (in his letter ad Evangelum) is responsible for the assertion
   that Dionysius was the last who, in accordance with the original custom
   of the Church of Alexandria, was nominated as Bishop by his
   fellow-presbyters there. Subsequently the Bishop was chosen (at least
   in theory) by the whole body of the faithful in the diocese, as in
   other parts of Christendom. Jerome's words do not seem to include
   consecration also by a fresh laying of hands by the presbytery, though
   Bishop Lightfoot (Philippians, p. 231) inferred from certain other
   evidence of a not very decisive kind that this was the case and that it
   was rendered necessary at first by the Bishop of Alexandria having had
   no other Bishops with him in Egypt until 190. Others hold that no fresh
   laying on of hands at all had been considered necessary, which is
   hardly probable. Mr. C. H. Turner (Cambridge Medieval History, vol. i.)
   has suggested that Jerome was misled by Arians who had their own
   interests to serve in making the assertion, while he himself was too
   ready to credit it in his zeal to uphold the presbyterate against the
   arrogant claims of the Roman deacons at that time. The present writer
   ventures to think that Jerome's statement, if correct, refers only to
   nomination and that an episcopal consecrator had been found elsewhere
   (e. g. in Africa or Palestine or Syria) for the laying on of hands as
   usual.
