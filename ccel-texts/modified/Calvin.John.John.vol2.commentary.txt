   CHAPTER 12
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 12:1-8

   1. Jesus therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany,
   where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
   2. There therefore they made him a banquet, and Martha served; [1] and
   Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with him. 3. Then Mary took a
   pound of ointment of costly spikenard, and anointed the feet of Jesus,
   and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the
   odor of the ointment. 4. Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the
   son of Simon, who was to betray him, saith, 5. Why was not this
   ointment sold for three hunted denarii, and given to the poor? 6. Now
   he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a
   thief, and had the purse, and carried what was put into it. 7. Jesus
   therefore said, Let her alone; for the day of my burial she hath kept
   it. 8. For the poor you have always with you, but me you have not
   always.


   1. Jesus came to Bethany. We see that they judged too rashly who
   thought that Christ would not come to the feast, [2] (John 11:56;) and
   this, reminds us that we ought not to be so hasty as not to wait
   patiently and quietly, till the season arrive, which is unknown to us.
   Now Jesus came first to Bethany, that thence he might go three days
   afterwards to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, he intended to give Judas a fit
   time and place for betraying him, that he might present himself, ready
   to be sacrificed, at the appointed time; for he is not ignorant of what
   is to take place, but willingly comes forward to be sacrificed.

   Having come to Bethany six days before the passover, he remained there
   four days; which may easily be inferred from Matthew and Mark. On what
   day the banquet was made for him, at which he was anointed by Mary,
   John does not state; but it seems probable that it took place not long
   after he had arrived. There are some who think that, the anointing
   mentioned by Matthew (Matthew 26:7) and Mark (Mark 14:3) is different
   from what is mentioned here; but they are mistaken. They have been led
   to adopt this view by a calculation of time, because the two
   Evangelists, (Matthew 26:2; Mark 14:1,) before relating that Christ was
   anointed, speak of two days as having elapsed. But the solution is
   easy, and may be given in two ways. For John does not say that Christ
   was anointed on the first day after his arrival; so that this might
   happen even when he was preparing to depart. Yet, as I have already
   said, there is another conjecture which is more probable, that he was
   anointed one day, at least, or two days, before his departure; for it
   is certain that Judas had made a bargain with the priests, before
   Christ sent two of his disciples to make ready the passover. [3] Now,
   at the very least, one day must have intervened. The Evangelists add,
   that he

   sought a convenient opportunity for betraying Christ,
   (Matthew 26:16,)

   after having received the bribe. When, therefore, after mentioning two
   days, they add the history of the anointing, they place last in the
   narrative what happened first. And the reason is, that after having
   related the words of Christ,

   You know that after two days the Son of man shall be betrayed,
   (Matthew 26:2,)

   they now add -- what had been formerly omitted -- in what manner and on
   what occasion he was betrayed by his disciple. There is thus a perfect
   agreement in the account of his having been anointed at Bethany.

   2. There therefore they made him a banquet. Matthew (Matthew 26:7) and
   Mark, (Mark 14:3) say that he then supped at the house of Simon the
   leper. John does not mention the house, but shows plainly enough, that
   it was in some other place than the house of Lazarus and Martha that he
   supped; for he says that Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with
   him, that is, one who had been invited along with Christ. Nor does it
   involve any contradiction, that Matthew and Mark relate that the head
   of Christ was anointed, while John relates that his feet were anointed.
   The usual practice was the anointing of the head, and on this account
   Pliny reckons it an instance of excessive luxury, that some anointed
   the ankles. The three Evangelists agree in this; that Mary did not
   anoint Christ sparingly, but poured on him a large quantity of
   ointment. What John speaks, about the feet, amounts to this, that the
   whole body of Christ, down to the feet, was anointed. There is an
   amplification in the word feet, which appears more fully from what
   follows, when he adds, that Mary wiped his feet with her hair

   3. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. It was not a
   simple liquor extracted from spikenard, but a compound of many
   odoriferous substances; and therefore it is not wonderful that the
   whole house was filled with the odor

   4. One of his disciples, therefore, saith. Next follows the murmuring
   of Judas, which Matthew (Matthew 16:8) attributes to the disciples
   indiscriminately, and Mark (Mark 14:4) to some of them; but it is
   customary in Scripture to apply to many, by way of synecdoche, what
   belongs to one or to a few. Yet I think it is probable, that the
   murmuring proceeded from Judas alone, and that the rest were induced to
   give him their assent, as murmurings, by fanning a flame, easily kindle
   in us a variety of dispositions; and more especially, as we are too
   prone to form unfavorable judgments, slanders are readily embraced by
   us. But the credulity which the Spirit of God reproves in the Apostles
   is a warning to us not to be too easy and credulous in listening to
   calumnious statements.

   5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii? A pound of
   ordinary ointment, Pliny tells us, cost not more than ten denarii; but
   the same Pliny says, that the highest price of the best ointment was
   three hundred and ten denarii. Now the Evangelists agree, that this was
   the most costly ointment, and Therefore Judas is correct in valuing a
   pound of it at three hundred denarii, -- a sum which, according to the
   computation of Budaeus, amounts to fifty livres of French money. And as
   almost every kind of luxury involves excess and superfluity, the
   greater the waste of money, the more plausible reason had Judas for
   murmuring; as if he had said, "Had Mary spent little, there would have
   been some excuse for her; but now, since, in a matter of no importance,
   she has wasted a vast sum of money, has she not done an injury to the
   poor, who might have obtained from such a sum great relief? What she
   has done, therefore, admits of no apology."

   6. Because he was a thief. The rest of the Apostles, not from any bad
   disposition, but thoughtlessly, condemn Mary. But Judas resorts to a
   plausible pretext for his wickedness, when he brings forward the poor,
   though he cared nothing about them. We are taught by this instance what
   a frightful beast the desire of possessing is; the loss which Judas
   thinks that he has sustained, by the loss of an opportunity for
   stealing, excites him to such rage that he does not hesitate to betray
   Christ. And probably, in what he said about the poor having been
   defrauded, he did not only speak falsely to others, but likewise
   flattered himself inwardly, as hypocrites are wont to do; as if the act
   of betraying Christ were a trivial fault, by which he endeavored to
   obtain compensation for the loss which he had sustained. He had but one
   reason, indeed, for betraying Christ; and that was, to regain in some
   way the prey which had been snatched from his hands; for it was the
   indignation excited in him, by the gain which he had lost, that drove
   him to the design of betraying Christ.

   It is wonderful that Christ should have chosen, as a steward, a person
   of this description, whom he knew to be a thief. For what else was it
   than to put into his hands a rope for strangling himself? Mortal man
   can give no other reply than this, that the judgments of God are a deep
   gulf. Yet the action of Christ ought not to be viewed as an ordinary
   rule, that we should commit the care of the poor, or any thing sacred,
   to a wicked and ungodly man. for God has laid down to us a law, who
   they are that ought to be called to the government of the Church, and
   to other offices; and this law we are not at liberty to violate. The
   case was otherwise with Christ, who, being the eternal Wisdom of God,
   furnished an opportunity for his secret predestination in the person of
   Judas.

   7. Let her alone. When Christ bids them let Mary alone, he shows that
   they act improperly and unjustly who disturb their neighbors without a
   good reason, and raise a disturbance about nothing. Christ's reply, as
   given by the other Evangelists, is longer; but the meaning is the same.
   The anointing, which Judas finds fault with, is defended on this
   ground, that it will serve for his burial. Christ, therefore, does not
   approve of! it as an ordinary service, or one which ought to be
   commonly used in the Church; for if he had intended that an office of
   this sort should be performed daily, he could have said something else
   instead of speaking of it as connected with his burial. God certainly
   does not approve of outward display. Nay, more, perceiving that the
   mind of man is too prone to carnal observances, He frequently enjoins
   us to be sober and moderate in the use of them. Those persons,
   therefore, are absurd interpreters, who infer from Christ's reply, that
   costly and magnificent worship is pleasing to God; for he rather
   excuses Mary on the ground of her having rendered to him an
   extraordinary service, which ought not to be regarded as a perpetual
   rule for the worship of God.

   For the day of my burial she hath kept it. When he says, that the
   ointment was kept, he means that it was not poured unseasonably, but
   with a due regard to the time when it occurred; for a thing is said to
   be kept, which is reserved in store to be brought cut at a fit time and
   place. It is certain that, if any person, at a former period, had
   burdened him with costly delicacies, he would not have endured it. But
   he affirms that Mary did not do this as a customary matter, but in
   order to discharge her last duty towards him. Besides, the anointing of
   bodies was not at that time a useless ceremony, but rather a spiritual
   symbol, to place before their eyes the hope of a resurrection. The
   promises were still obscure; Christ had not risen, who is justly
   designated the first-fruits of them that rise, (1 Corinthians 15:20.)
   Believers, therefore, needed such aids to direct them to Christ, who
   was still absent; and, accordingly, the anointing of Christ was not at
   that time superfluous, for he was soon to be buried, and he was
   anointed as if he were to be laid in the tomb. The disciples were not
   yet aware of this, and Mary unquestionably was suddenly moved to do,
   under the direction of the Spirit of God, what she had not previously
   intended. But Christ applies to the hope of his resurrection what they
   so greatly disapproved, in order that the usefulness, which he pointed
   out to them in this action, [4] might lead them to renounce the fretful
   and wicked opinion which they had formed respecting it. As it was the
   will of God that the childhood of his ancient people should be guided
   by such exercises, so, in the present day, it would be foolish to
   attempt the same thing; nor could it be done without offering an insult
   to Christ, who has driven away such shadows by the brightness of his
   coming. But as his resurrection had not yet brought the fulfillment of
   the shadows of the Law, it was proper that his burial should be adorned
   by an outward ceremony. The odor of his resurrection has now sufficient
   efficacy, without spikenard and costly ointments, to quicken the whole
   world. But let us remember that, in judging of the actions of men, we
   ought to abide by the decision of Christ alone, at whose tribunal we
   must one day stand.

   8. For the poor you have always with you. We must observe what I have
   already pointed out, that a distinction is here drawn expressly between
   the extraordinary action of Mary, and the daily service which is due to
   Christ. Those persons, therefore, are apes, and not imitators, who are
   desirous to serve Christ by costly and splendid display; as if Christ
   approved of what was done once, and did not rather forbid that it
   should be done afterwards.

   But me you have not always. When he says, that he will not always be
   with his disciples, this ought to be referred to that kind of presence
   to which carnal worship and costly honors are suitable. For as to his
   presence with us by the grace and power of his Spirit, his dwelling in
   us, and also feeding us with his flesh and blood, this has nothing to
   do with bodily observances. Of all the pompous ceremonies which the
   Papists have contrived for the worship of Christ, in vain do they tell
   us, that they have bestowed them upon him, for he openly rejects them.
   When he says, that the poor will always be with us, though, by this
   saying, he reproves the hypocrisy of the Jews, yet we may learn from it
   a profitable doctrine; namely, that alms, by which the wants of the
   poor are relieved, are sacrifices acceptable, and of sweet savor, to
   God, and that any other kind of expense in the worship of God is
   improperly bestowed.

   John 12:9-15

   9. Then a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was there, and came,
   not on account of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also,
   whom he had raised from the dead. 10. Now the chief priests consulted,
   that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11. For many of the Jews on
   his account went away, and believed on Jesus. 12. next day, a great
   multitude, who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was
   come to Jerusalem, 13. Took branches of palm trees, trod went out to
   meet him, and shouted, Hosanna, Blessed be the King of Israel, that
   cometh in the name of the Lord. 14. And Jesus, having found a young'
   ass, sat upon it, as it is written, 15. Fear not, daughter of Zion,
   because thy King cometh sitting on the foal of an ass.


   9. Then a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was there. The more
   nearly the time of the death of Christ approached, it became the more
   necessary that his name should be universally celebrated, in order that
   it might be a preparation for stronger faith after his death. More
   especially, the Evangelist relates that the recent miracle of the
   resurrection of Lazarus had acquired great celebrity: and as Christ
   showed in it a remarkable proof of his Divinity, God intended that it
   should have many witnesses. When he says that they came not on account
   of Jesus only, but also for the sake of Lazarus, he does not mean that
   they came out of regard to Lazarus, as if they bestowed this mark of
   honor on him in particular, but that they might behold the astonishing
   display of the power of Christ in Lazarus.

   10. Now the chief priests consulted. It certainly was worse than insane
   fury to endeavor to put to death one who had manifestly been raised
   from the dead by divine power. But such is the spirit of giddiness with
   which Satan torments the wicked, so that there is no end of their
   madness, even though God should bring heaven, and earth, and sea, to
   oppose them. For this wicked consultation is thus described, for the
   purpose of informing us that the enemies of Christ were led to so great
   obstinacy, not by mistake or folly, but by furious wickedness, so that
   they did not even shrink from making war against God; and also for the
   purpose of informing us that the power of God was not dimly seen in the
   resurrection of Lazarus, since ungodliness could contrive no other
   method of banishing it from remembrance than by perpetrating a base and
   shocking murder on an innocent man. Besides, since Satan labors with
   his utmost strength utterly to bury, or at least in some measure to
   obscure, the works of God, it is our duty to devote ourselves
   diligently to continual meditation on them.

   12. The next day, a great multitude. This entrance of Christ is more
   copiously related (Matthew 21:1; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:29) by the other
   Evangelists; but John here embraces the leading points. In the first
   place, we ought to remember Christ's design, which was, that he came to
   Jerusalem of his own accord, to. offer himself to die; for it was
   necessary that his death should be voluntary, because the wrath of God
   could be appeased only by a sacrifice of obedience. And, indeed, he
   well knew what would be the result; but before he is dragged to the
   cross, he wishes to be solemnly acknowledged by the people as their
   King; nay, he openly declares that he commences his reign by advancing
   to death, but though his approach was celebrated by a vast crowd of
   people, still he remained unknown to his enemies until, by the
   fulfillment of prophecies, which we shall afterwards see in their own
   place, he proved that he was the true Messiah; for he wished to omit
   nothing that would contribute to the full confirmation of our faith.

   A great multitude, which came to the feast. Thus strangers were more
   ready to discharge the duty of paying respect to the Son of God than
   the citizens of Jerusalem, who ought rather to have been all example to
   all others. For they had sacrifices daily; the temple was always before
   their eyes, which ought to have: kindled in their hearts the desire of
   seeking God; these too were the highest teachers of the Church, and
   there was the sanctuary of the divine light. It is therefore a
   manifestation of excessively base ingratitude in them that, after they
   have been trained to such exercise from their earliest years, they
   reject or despise the Redeemer who had been promised to them. But this
   fault has prevailed in almost every age, that the more nearly and the
   more familiarly God approached to men, the more daringly did men
   despise God.

   In other men who, having left their homes, assembled to celebrate the
   feast, we observe much greater ardor, so that they eagerly inquire
   about Christ; and when they hear that he is coming into the city, they
   go out to meet and congratulate him. And yet it cannot be doubted that
   they were aroused by a secret movement of the Spirit to meet him. We do
   not read that this was done on any former occasion. But as earthly
   princes summon their subjects by the sound of a trumpet or by the
   public crier, when they go to take possession of their kingdom, so
   Christ, by a movement of his Spirit, assembled this people, that they
   might hail him as their king. When the multitudes wished to make him a
   king, while he was in the wilderness, (John 6:15,) he withdrew secretly
   into the mountain; for at that time they dreamed of no other kingdom
   than one under which they might be well fattened, in the same manner as
   cattle. Christ could not therefore grant and comply with their foolish
   and absurd wish, without denying himself, and renouncing the office
   which the Father had bestowed upon him. But now he claims for himself
   such a kingdom as he had received from the Father. I readily
   acknowledge that the people who went out to meet him were not well
   acquainted with the nature of this kingdom; but Christ looked to the
   future. Meanwhile, he permitted nothing to be done that was not
   suitable to his spiritual kingdom.

   13. Took branches of palm-trees. The palm was the emblem of victory and
   peace among the ancients; but they were wont to employ branches of
   palm-trees, when they bestowed kingly power on any one, or when they
   humbly supplicated the favor of a conqueror. But those persons appear
   to have taken into their hands branches of palm-trees, as a token of
   gladness and rejoicing at receiving a new king.

   Shouted, Hosanna. By this phrase they testified that they acknowledged
   Jesus Christ to be the Messiah, who had anciently been promised to the
   fathers, and from whom redemption and salvation were to be expected.
   For the Psalm 118:25 from which that exclamation is taken was composed
   in reference to the Messiah for this purpose, that all the saints might
   continually desire and ardently long for his coming, and might receive
   him with the utmost reverence, when he was manifested. It is therefore
   probable, or rather it may be inferred with certainty, that this prayer
   was frequently used by the Jews, and, consequently, was in every man's
   mouth; so that the Spirit of God put words into the mouths, [5] of
   those men, when they wished a prosperous arrival to the Lord Jesus; and
   they were chosen by him as heralds to attest that Christ was come.

   The word Hosanna is composed of two Hebrew words, and means, Save, I
   beseech you. The Hebrews, indeed, pronounce it differently, (hvsy-n')
   Hoshianna; [6] but it usually happens that the pronunciation of words
   is corrupted, when they are transferred to a foreign language. Yet the
   Evangelists, though they wrote in Greek, purposely retained the Hebrew
   word, in order to express more fully that the multitude employed the
   ordinary form of prayer, which was first employed by David, and
   afterwards throughout an uninterrupted succession of ages, received by
   the people of God, and peculiarly consecrated for the purpose of
   blessing the kingdom of the Messiah. [7] To the same purpose are the
   words which immediately follow, Blessed be the King of Israel, who
   cometh in the name of the Lord; for this is also a joyful prayer for
   the happy and prosperous success of that kingdom, on which the
   restoration and prosperity of the Church of God depended.

   But as David appears to speak of himself rather than of Christ in that
   psalm, we must first of all solve this difficulty; nor will the task be
   hard. We know for what purpose the kingdom was established in the hand
   of David and of his posterity; and that purpose was, that it might be a
   sort of prelude of the everlasting kingdom which was to be manifested
   at the proper time. And, indeed, it was not necessary that David should
   confine his attention to himself; and the Lord, by the prophets,
   frequently commands all the godly to turn their eyes to a different
   person from David. [8] So then all that David sung about himself is
   justly referred to that king who, according to the promise, was to
   arise from the seed of David to be the redeemer.

   But we ought to derive from it a profitable admonition; for if we are
   members of the Church, the Lord calls upon us to cherish the same
   desire which he wished believers to cherish under the Law; that is,
   that we should wish with our whole heart that the kingdom of Christ
   should flourish and prosper; and not only so, but that we should
   demonstrate this by our prayers. In order To give us greater courage in
   prayer, we ought to observe that he prescribes to us the words. Woe
   then to our slothfulness, if we extinguish by our coldness, or quench
   by indifference, that ardor which God excites. Yet let us know that the
   prayers which we offer by the direction and authority of God will not
   be in vain. Provided that we be not indolent or grow weary in praying,
   He will be a faithful guardian of his kingdom, to defend it by his
   invincible power and protection. True, indeed, though we remain drowsy
   and inactive, [9] the majesty of his kingdom will be firm and sure; but
   when -- as is frequently the ease -- it is less prosperous than it
   ought to be, or rather falls into decay, as we perceive it to be, at
   the present day, fearfully scattered and wasted, this unquestionably
   arises through our fault. And when but a small restoration, or almost
   none, is to be seen, or when at least it advances slowly, let us
   ascribe it to our indifference. We daily ask from God that his kingdom
   may come, (Matthew 6:10,) but scarcely one man in a hundred earnestly
   desires it. Justly, therefore, are we deprived of the blessing of God,
   which we are weary of asking.

   We are also taught by this expression, that it is God alone who
   preserves and defends the Church; for He does not claim for himself, or
   command us to give him, anything but what is his own. Since, therefore,
   while He guides our tongues, we pray that he may preserve the kingdom
   of Christ, we acknowledge that, in order that this kingdom may remain
   in a proper state, God himself is the only bestower of salvation. He
   employs, indeed, the labors of men for this purpose, but of men whom
   his own hand has prepared for the work. Besides, while he makes use of
   men for advancing, or maintaining the kingdom of Christ, still every
   thing is begun and completed, through their agency, by God alone
   through the power of his Spirit.

   Who cometh in the name of the Lord. We must first understand what is
   meant by this phrase, to come in the name of the Lord. He who does not
   rashly put himself forward, or falsely assume the honor, but, being
   duly called, has the direction and authority of God for his actions,
   cometh in the name of God This title belongs to all the true servants
   of God. A Prophet who guided by the Holy Spirit, honestly delivers to
   men the doctrine which he has received from heaven, -- cometh in the
   name of God. A King, by whose hand God governs his people cometh in the
   same name. But as the Spirit of the Lord rested on Christ, and he is
   the Head of all things, (Ephesians 1:22,) and all who have ever been
   ordained to rule over the Church are subject to his say, or rather, are
   streams flowing from him as the fountain, he is justly said to have
   come in the name of God. Nor is it only by the high rank of his
   authority that he surpasses others, but because God manifests himself
   to us fully in him; for in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead
   bodily, as Paul says, (Colossians 2:9,) and he is the lively image of
   God, (Hebrews 1:3,) and, in short, is the true lmmanuel, (Matthew
   1:23.) It is therefore by a special right that he is said to have come
   in the name of the Lord, because by him God has manifested himself
   fully, and not partially, as he had formerly done by the Prophets. We
   ought therefore to begin with him as the Head, when we wish to bless
   the servants of God.

   Now since the false prophets arrogantly boast of the name of God, and
   shelter themselves under this false pretense, we ought to supply an
   opposite clause in the prayer, that the Lord may scatter and utterly
   destroy them. Thus we cannot bless Christ without cursing the Pope and
   that sacrilegious tyranny which he has raised up against the Son of
   God. [10] He huffs his excommunications against us, indeed, with great
   violence, as if they were thunderbolts, but they are mere air-bladders,
   [11] and therefore we ought boldly to despise them. On the contrary,
   the Holy Spirit here dictates to us an awful curse, that it may sink
   the Pope to the lowest hell, with all his pomp and splendor. Nor is it
   necessary that there should be any Bishop or Pontiff [12] to pronounce
   the curse against him, since Christ at one time bestowed this authority
   on children, when he approved of their crying in the temple, and
   saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, as the other Evangelists relate,
   (Matthew 21:15, 16.)

   14. And Jesus having found a young ass. This part of the history is
   more minutely related by the other Evangelists, who tell us, that
   Christ sent two of his disciples to bring an ass, (Matthew 21:1; Mark
   11:1; Luke 19:29.) John, who was the latest writer of all the
   Evangelists, reckoned it enough to notice briefly the substance of what
   had been stated by the rest; and, on this account, he leaves out many
   circumstances. An apparent contradiction, by which many persons are
   perplexed, is very easily removed. When Matthew says, that Christ sat
   upon a she-ass and her colt, we ought to view it as a synecdoche. [13]
   Some imagine that he sat first on the she-ass, and afterwards on her
   colt; and out of this conjecture they frame an allegory, that he first
   sat on the Jewish people, who had been long accustomed to bear the yoke
   of the Law, and afterwards. subdued the Gentiles, like an untrained
   young ass which had never carried a rider. [14] But the plain truth is,
   that Christ rode on an ass which had been brought along with its
   mother; and to this agree the words of the Prophet, who, by a
   repetition very frequent among the Hebrews, expresses the same thing
   twice by different words. On an ass, he says, and on the colt of an ass
   which was under the yoke, (hupozugiou) Our Evangelist, who studies
   brevity, leaves out the former clause, and quotes only the latter.

   The Jews themselves are constrained to expound the prediction of
   Zechariah 9:9, which was at that time fulfilled, as referring to the
   Messiah; but, at the same time, they ridiculed us for being led astray
   by the shadow of an ass, [15] a so as to give the honor of the Messiah
   to the son of Mary. But far different are the testimonies on which our
   faith rests. And, indeed, when we say that Jesus is the Messiah, we do
   not begin by saying, that he entered into Jerusalem sitting on an ass;
   for there was displayed in him a glory, such as belonged to the Son of
   God, as we have seen under the first chapter of this Gospel; [16] and
   it was chiefly in his resurrection that his Divine power was
   illustriously displayed. But we ought not to despise this confirmation,
   that God, by his wonderful Providence, exhibited on that entrance, as
   on a public stage, the fulfillment of that which Zechariah had
   foretold.

   Fear not. In these words of the Prophet, as the Evangelist quotes them,
   we ought to observe, first, that never is tranquillity restored to our
   minds, or fear and trembling banished from them, except by knowing that
   Christ reigns amongst us. The words of the Prophet, indeed, are
   different; for he exhorts believers to gladness and rejoicing. But the
   Evangelist has here described the manner in which our hearts exult with
   true joy. It is, when that fear is removed, with which all must be
   tormented, until, being reconciled to God, they obtain that peace which
   springs from faith, (Romans 5:1.) This benefit, therefore, comes to us
   through Christ, that, freed from the tyranny of Satan, the yoke of sin
   being broken, guilt canceled, and death abolished, we freely boast,
   relying on the protection of our King, since they who are placed under
   his guardianship ought not to fear any danger. Not that we are free
   From fear, so long as we live in the world, but because confidence,
   founded on Christ, rises superior to all than. Though Christ was still
   at a distance, yet the Prophet exhorted the godly men of that age to be
   glad and joyful, because Christ was to come. Behold, said he, thy King
   will come; therefore fear not. Now that he is come, in order that we
   may enjoy his presence, we ought more vigorously to contend with fear,
   that, freed from our enemies, we may peacefully and joyfully honor our
   King.

   Daughter of Zion. The Prophet addressed Zion in his own time, because
   that was the habitation and abode of the Church. God has now, indeed,
   collected a Church for himself out of the whole world; but this promise
   is peculiarly addressed to believers, who submit to Christ, that he may
   reign in them. When he describes Christ as riding on an ass, the
   meaning is, that his kingdom will have nothing in common with the pomp,
   splendor, wealth, and power of the world; and it was proper that this
   should be made known by an outward manifestation, that all might be
   fully assured that it is spiritual.

   John 12:16-19

   16. These things his disciples did not understand at first; but when
   Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been
   written concerning him, and that they had done these things to him. 17.
   And the multitude, which were with him, gave their testimony that he
   had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and had raised him from the dead.
   18. For this reason the multitude met him, because they had heard that
   he had performed. this miracle. 19. The Pharisees therefore said among
   themselves, Perceive you not that you gain nothing? Behold, the world
   is gone after him.


   16. These things his disciples did not understand at first. As the seed
   does not spring up as soon as it is thrown into the earth, so the
   result of the works of God is not immediately seen. The Apostles are
   the servants of God to fulfill the prophecy, but they do not understand
   what they are doing. They hear the shout of the multitude, which was no
   confused noise, but a distinct salutation of Christ as King; but they
   do not perceive what is the object of it, or what it means. To them,
   therefore, it is an unmeaning exhibition, until the Lord, after his
   glorious resurrection, opens their eyes.

   When it is said, that they at length remembered that these things had
   been written concerning him, the Evangelist points out the cause of
   such gross ignorance, by which their knowledge was preceded. It was
   because they had not the Scripture at that time as their guide and
   instructor, to direct their minds to just and accurate views; for we
   are blind, unless the word of God go before,, our steps, and it is not
   even enough that the word of God shine on us, if the Spirit do not also
   enlighten our eyes, which otherwise would be blind amidst the clearest
   light. This grace Christ bestowed on his disciples after his
   resurrection, because the full time, when the Spirit should bestow his
   riches in great abundance, was not come, until he was received into the
   heavenly glory, as we have seen under John 7:39 [17]

   Taught by this example, let us learn to form our judgment of every
   thing that relates to Christ, not by our own carnal feelings, but by
   the Scripture. Besides, let us remember that it is a special favor of
   the Holy Spirit to instruct us in a gradual manner, that we may not be
   stupid in considering the works of God.

   That these things had been written concerning him, and that they had
   done these things to him. I interpret that clause in this manner:
   "Then, for the first time, did it occur to the disciples that Christ
   did not do these things rashly, and that those men were not employed in
   idle amusement; but that the whole of this transaction had been
   regulated by the providence of God, because those things which had been
   written must necessarily be fulfilled;" so that the words may be thus
   arranged: "They did these things to him, as they had been written
   concerning him."

   17. The multitude gave their testimony. He again repeats what he had
   said, that many persons, aroused by the report of so great a miracle,
   came to meet Christ. The reason why they go out in crowds is, that the
   rumor, respecting Lazarus who had been restored to life, was widely
   spread. They had good reason, therefore, for ascribing to the son of
   Mary the honor of the Messiah, since he was known to possess such
   extraordinary power.

   19. Do you not see that you gain nothing? By these words they urge
   themselves to greater rage; for it may be regarded as a reproach of
   their slothfulness, as if they had said, that the reason why the people
   revolted and followed Christ was their own excessive indolence and
   cowardice. This is the way in which desperate men are wont to talk,
   when they are making themselves ready for attempting any extreme
   measures. And if the enemies of God persevere so obstinately in what is
   evil, we ought to be far more steady in a just undertaking.

   John 12:20-26

   20. Low there were some Greeks among these who had come up to worship
   at the feast. 21. These therefore went to Philip, who was of Bethsaida
   of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. 22.
   Philip cometh and telleth, Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell
   Jesus. 23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, when the
   Son of man must be glorified. 24. Verily, verily, I say to you, Unless
   a grain of wheat, having fallen into the ground, die, it remaineth
   alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. 25. He who loveth
   his soul shall destroy it; and he who hateth his soul in this world
   shall keep it to eternal life. 26. If any man serves me, let him follow
   me; and where I am, there also shall my servant be. And if any man
   shall serve me, my Father will honor him.


   20. Now there were some Greeks. I do not think that they were Gentiles
   or uncircumcised, because immediately afterwards it follows that they
   came to worship. Now it was strictly prohibited by the Roman laws, and
   severely punished by the Proconsuls and other magistrates, if any
   person was discovered to have left the worship of his native country
   and passed over to, the Jewish religion. But Jews, who were scattered
   throughout Asia and Greece, were allowed to cross the sea for the
   purpose of offering sacrifices in the temple. Besides, the Jews were
   not permitted to associate with them in the solemn worship of God,
   because they thought that the temple, and the sacrifices, and
   themselves, would in that way be polluted. But though they were the
   descendants of Jews, yet as they resided at a great distance beyond the
   sea, we need not wonder that the Evangelist introduces them as
   strangers and unacquainted with the occurrences which took place at
   that time in Jerusalem and in places adjacent. The meaning therefore
   is, that Christ was received as King, not only by the inhabitants of
   Judea, who had come from villages and towns to the feast, but that the
   report had also reached men who lived beyond the sea, and who had come
   from distant countries.

   To worship. They might have done this also in their own country; but
   John describes here solemn worship, which was accompanied by
   sacrifices. For though religion and the fear of God were not confined
   to the temple, yet in no other place were they permitted to offer
   sacrifices to God, nor had they any where else the Ark of the
   Testimony, which was the token of the presence of God. Every man
   worshipped God daily at his own house in a spiritual manner; but the
   saints under the Law were likewise bound to make profession of outward
   worship and obedience, [18] such as was prescribed by Moses, by
   appearing in the temple in the presence of God. Such was the design for
   which the feasts were appointed. And if those men undertook so long a
   journey at great expense, with great inconvenience, and not without
   personal risk, that they might not treat with indifference the external
   profession of their piety, what apology can we now offer, if we do not
   testify, in our own houses, that we worship the true God? The worship
   which belonged to the Law has indeed come to an end; but the Lord has
   left to his Church Baptism, the Lord's Supper, and public prayer, that
   in those exercises believers may be employed. If we despise them,
   therefore. it proves that our desire of godliness is excessively cold.

   21. These men therefore went to Philip. It is an indication of
   reverence, that they do not address Christ, but are desirous to obtain
   access through Philip; for reverence always begets modesty. The
   inference which the Papists draw from this, that we ought to call on
   departed saints, [19] that they may be our advocates with Christ and
   with the Father, is so ridiculous that it does not need refutation. The
   Greeks address Philip, while he is present; and, pray, where is the
   resemblance to those who address their prayers to departed saints, from
   whom they are separated? [20] But such are the fruits of human
   presumption, when it has once permitted itself to go beyond the limits
   of the word of God. Invocation of the saints has been rashly fabricated
   by the Papists out of their own brain; and now, in order to shelter
   themselves under a false pretense borrowed from the word of God, they
   corrupt the Scripture, and tear it to pieces, and do not scruple to
   expose it to shameful taunts.

   23. The hour is come. Many explain this as referring to the death of
   Christ, because by it the glory of Christ was manifested; so that, in
   their opinion, Christ now declares that the time of his death is at
   hand. But I rather view it as referring to the publication of the
   gospel; as if he had said, that the knowledge of him would soon be
   spread through every region of the world. Thus he wished to meet the
   astonishment which his death might excite in his disciples; for he
   shows that there is no reason why their courage should fail, because
   the doctrine of the' gospel will nevertheless be proclaimed throughout
   the whole world. Again, that this contemplation of his glow may not
   soon afterwards vanish, when he shall be condemned to death, hung on
   the cross, and finally buried. he gives them early information and
   warning that the ignominy of his death is no obstruction to his glory.
   For this purpose he employs a most appropriate comparison.

   24. Unless a grain of wheat having fallen into the ground, die, it
   remaineth alone. If a grain of wheat do not die or putrefy, it
   continues to be dry and unfruitful; but the death of the seed has the
   beneficial effect of quickening it, that it may yield fruit. In short,
   Christ compares his death to sowing, which appears to tend to the
   destruction of the wheat, but yet is the cause of far more abundant
   increase. Though this admonition was especially necessary at that time,
   yet it is of continual use in the Church. And, first, we ought to begin
   with the Head. That dreadful appearance of disgrace and cursing, which
   appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures his glory, but
   removes it altogether from our view. We must not, therefore, confine
   our attention to his death alone, but must likewise consider the fruit
   which has been yielded by his glorious resurrection. [21] Thus there
   will be nothing to prevent his glory from being every where displayed.
   From him we must next come to the members; for not only do we think
   that we perish in death, but our life also is a sort of continual
   death, (Colossians 3:3.) We shall therefore be undone, unless we be
   supported by that consolation which Paul holds out:

   if our outward man decays, the inward man is renewed
   from day to day, (2 Corinthians 4:16.)

   When, therefore, the godly are distressed by various afflictions, when
   they are pressed hard by the difficulties of their situation, when they
   suffer hunger, or nakedness, or disease, when they are assailed by
   reproaches, when it appears as if they would every hour be almost
   overwhelmed by death, let them unceasingly consider that this is a
   sowing which, in due time, will yield fruit.

   25. He who loveth his soul shall destroy it. To doctrine Christ joins
   exhortation; for if we must die in order that we may bring forth fruit,
   we ought patiently to permit God to mortify us. But as he draws a
   contrast between the love of life and the hatred of lit, we ought to
   understand what it is to love and hate life. He who, under the
   influence of immoderate desire of the present life, cannot leave the
   world but by constraint, is said to love life; but he who, despising
   life, advances courageously to death, is said to hate life. Not that we
   ought absolutely to hate life, which is justly reckoned to be one of
   the highest of God's blessings; but because believers ought cheerfully
   to lay it down, when it retards them from approaching to Christ; just
   as a man, when he wishes to make haste in any matter, would shake off
   from his shoulders a heavy and disagreeable burden. In short, to love
   this life is not in itself wrong, provided that we only pass through it
   as pilgrims, keeping our eyes always fixed on our object. For the true
   limit of loving life, is, when we continue in it as long as it pleases
   God, and when we are prepared to leave it as soon as he shall order us,
   or -- to express it in a single word -- when we carry it, as it were,
   in our hands, and offer it to God as a sacrifice. Whoever carries his
   attachment to the present life beyond this limit, destroys his life;
   that is, he consigns it to everlasting ruin. For the word destroy
   (apolesei) does not signify to lose, or to sustain the loss of
   something valuable, but to devote it to destruction.

   His soul. It frequently happens that the word psuche, soul, is put for
   life. Some consider it as denoting, in this passage, the seat of the
   affections; as if Christ had said, "tie who too much indulges the
   (desires of his flesh destroys his soul." But that is a forced
   interpretation, and the other is more natural, that he who disregards
   his own life takes the best method of enjoying it eternally.

   In this world. To make the meaning still more clear, the phrase in this
   world, which is but once expressed, ought to be twice repeated, so that
   the meaning may be, "They do not take the proper method of preserving
   their life who love it in this world, but, on the other hand, they
   truly know how to preserve their life who despise it in this world."
   And, indeed, whoever is attached to the world does, of his own accord,
   deprive himself of the heavenly life, of which we cannot be heirs in
   any other way than by being strangers and foreigners in the world. The
   consequence is, that the more anxious any person is about his own
   safety, the farther does he remove himself from the kingdom of God,
   that is, from the true life.

   He who hateth his soul [22] I have already suggested that this
   expression is used comparatively; because we ought to despise life, so
   far as it hinders us from living to God; for if meditation on the
   heavenly life were the prevailing sentiment in our hearts:. the world
   would have no influence in detaining us. Hence, too, we obtain a reply
   to an objection that might be urged. "Many persons, through despair, or
   for other reasons, and chiefly from weariness of life, kill themselves;
   and yet we will not say that such persons provide for their own safety,
   while others are hurried to death by ambition, who also rush down to
   ruin." [23] But here Christ speaks expressly of that hatred or contempt
   of this fading life, which believers derive: from the contemplation of
   a better life. Consequently, whoever does not look to heaven, has not
   yet learned in what way life must be preserved. Besides, this latter
   clause was added by Christ, in order to strike terror into those who
   are too desirous of the earthly life; for if we are overwhelmed by the
   love of the world, so that we cannot easily forget it, it is impossible
   for us to go to heaven. But since the Son of God [24] arouses us so
   violently, it would be the height of folly to sleep a mortal sleep.

   26. If any, man serve me. That death may not be exceedingly bitter and
   disagreeable to us, Christ invites us by his example to submit to it
   cheerfully; and certainly we shall be ashamed to refuse the honor of
   being his disciples. But on no other condition does he admit us into
   their number, except that we follow the path which he points out. He
   leads the way to us to suffer death. The bitterness of death is
   therefore mitigated, and is in some measure rendered agreeable, when we
   have in common with the Son of God the condition of submitting to it.
   So far is it from being proper that we should shrink from Christ on
   account of the cross, that we ought rather to desire death for his
   sake. To the same purpose. pose is the statement which immediately
   follows:

   And where I am, there shall also my servant be. For he demands that his
   servants should not refuse to submit to death, to which they see him go
   before them as an example; for it is not right that; the servant should
   have any thing separate from his lord.. The future tense, shall be,
   (estai) is put for let him be, according to the custom of the Hebrew
   language. Others regard it as a consolation, as if Christ promised to
   those who should not be unwilling to die along with him, that they
   would be partakers of his resurrection. But the former view, as I have
   said, is more probable; for he afterwards adds the consolation, that
   the Father will not leave without reward the servants of Christ who
   shall have been his companions both in life and in death.

   John 12:27-33

   27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from
   this hour; but for this cause came I into this hour. 28. Father,
   glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have both glorified
   and will glorify it again. 29. Therefore the multitude, who were there,
   and heard it, said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to
   him. 30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for my sake, but
   for yours. 31. Now is the judgment of this world; now is the prince of
   this world cast out. 32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
   draw all men to me. 33. Now this he said, intimating by what death he
   should die.


   27. Now is my soul troubled. This statement appears at first to differ
   widely from the preceding discourse. He had displayed extraordinary
   courage and magnanimity by exhorting his disciples not only to suffer
   death, but willingly and cheerfully to desire it, whenever it is
   necessary; and now, by shrinking from death, he confesses his
   cowardice. Yet there is nothing in this passage that is not in perfect
   harmony, as every believer knows by his own experience. If scornful men
   laugh at it, we need not wonder; for it cannot be understood but by
   practice.

   Besides, it was highly useful, and even necessary for our salvation,
   that the Son of God should have experience of such feelings, In his
   death we ought chiefly to consider his atonement, by which he appeased
   the wrath and curse of God, which he could not have done, without
   taking upon himself our guilt. The death which he underwent must
   therefore have been full of horror, because he could not render
   satisfaction for us, without feeling, in his own experience, the
   dreadful judgment of God; and hence we come to know more fully the
   enormity of sin, for which the Heavenly Father exacted so dreadful a
   punishment from his only-begotten Son. Let us therefore know, that
   death was not a sport and amusement to Christ, but that he endured the
   severest torments on our account.

   Nor was it unsuitable that the Son of God should be troubled in this
   manner; for the Divine nature, being concealed, and not exerting its
   force, may be said to have reposed, in order to give an opportunity of
   making expiation. But Christ himself was clothed, not only with our
   flesh, but with human feelings. In him, no doubt, those feelings were
   voluntary; for he feared, not through constraint, but because he had,
   of his own accord, subjected himself to fear. And yet we ought to
   believe, that it was not in pretense, but in reality, that he feared;
   though he differed from other men in this respect, that he had all his
   feelings regulated in obedience to the righteousness of God, as we have
   said elsewhere.

   There is also another advantage which it yields to us. If the dread of
   death had occasioned no uneasiness to the Son of God, [25] which of us
   would have thought that his example was applicable to our case? For it
   has not been given to us to die without, feeling of regret; but when we
   learn that He had not within him a hardness like stone or iron, [26] we
   summon courage to follow him, and the weakness of the flesh, which
   makes us tremble at death, does not hinder us from becoming the
   companions of our General in struggling with it.

   And what shall I, say? Here we see, as it were, before our eyes, how
   much our salvation cost the Son of God, when he was reduced to such
   extremity of distress, that he found neither words to express the
   intensity of his sorrow, nor yet resolution as man. He betakes himself
   to prayer, which is his only remaining resource, and asks to be
   delivered from death. Again, perceiving also that, by the eternal
   purpose of God, he has been appointed to be a sacrifice for sins, he
   suddenly corrects that wish which his prodigious sorrow had wrung from
   him, and puts forth his hand, as it were, to pull himself back, that he
   may entirely acquiesce in the will of his Father.

   In this passage we ought to observe five steps. For, first, there is
   the complaint, which breaks out from vehement sorrow. Secondly, he
   feels that he needs a remedy, and, in order that he may not be
   overwhelmed with fear, he puts the question to himself, what he ought
   to do. Thirdly, he goes to the Father, and entreats him to deliver him.
   Fourthly, he recalls the wish which he knows to be inconsistent with
   his calling, and chooses rather to suffer anything than not to fulfill
   what his Father has enjoined upon him. Lastly, he is satisfied with the
   glory of God alone, forgets all things else, and reckons them of no
   value.

   But it may be thought, that it is unbecoming in the Son of God rashly
   to utter a wish which he must immediately retract, in order to obey his
   Father. I readily admit, that this is the folly of the cross, which
   gives offense to proud men; but the more the Lord of glory humbled
   himself, so much the more illustrious is the manifestation of his vast
   love to us. Besides, we ought to recollect what I have already stated,
   that the human feelings, from which Christ was not exempt, were in him
   pure and free from sin. The reason is, that they were guided and
   regulated in obedience to God; for there is nothing to prevent Christ
   from having a natural dread of death, and yet desiring to obey God.
   This holds true in various respects: and hence he corrects himself by
   saying,

   For this cause came I into this hour. For though he may lawfully
   entertain a dread of death, yet, considering why he was sent, and what
   his office as Redeemer demands from him, he presents to his Father the
   dread which arose out of his natural disposition, in order that it may
   be subdued, or rather, having subdued it, he prepares freely and
   willingly to execute the command of God. Now, if the feelings of
   Christ, which were free from all sin, needed to be restrained in this
   manner, how earnestly ought we to apply to this object, since the
   numerous affections which spring from our flesh are so many enemies to
   God in us! Let the godly, therefore, persevere in doing violence to
   themselves, until they have denied themselves.

   It must also be observed, that we ought to restrain not only those
   affections which are directly contrary to the will of God, but those
   which hinder the progress of our calling, though, in other respects,
   they are not wicked or sinful. To make this more fully evident, we
   ought to place in the first rank the will of God; in the second, the
   will of man pure and entire, such as God gave to Adam, and such as was
   in Christ: and, lastly, our own, which is infected by the contagion of
   sin. The will of God is the rule, to which every thing that is inferior
   ought to be subjected. Now, the pure will of nature will not of itself
   rebel against God; but man, though he were wholly formed to
   righteousness, would meet with many obstructions, unless he subject his
   affections to God. Christ, therefore, had but one battle to fight,
   which was, to cease to fear what he naturally feared, as soon as he
   perceived that the pleasure of God was otherwise. We, on the other
   hand, have a twofold battle; for we must struggle with the obstinacy of
   the flesh. The consequence is, that the most valiant combatants never
   vanquish without being wounded.

   Father, save me. This is the order which ought to be maintained,
   whenever we are either distressed by fear, or oppressed with grief. Our
   hearts ought instantly to be raised up to God. For there is nothing
   worse, or more injurious, than to nourish inwardly what torments us; as
   we see a great part of the world consumed by hidden torments, and all
   who do not rise to God are justly punished for their indolence by never
   receiving any alleviation.

   28. Father, glorify thy name. By these words he testifies, that he
   prefers the glory of the Father to all things else, and even neglects
   and disregards his own life. And the true regulation of all our desires
   is, to seek the glory of God in such a manner that all other things
   shall give way to it; for it ought to be reckoned by us an abundant
   recompense, leading us to endure patiently all that is vexatious or
   irksome.

   I have both glorified it. It is as if he had said, I will finish what I
   have begun; for God never leaveth the work of his hands imperfect as it
   is said, Psalm 138:8. But as it is the purpose of God to prevent the
   offense of the cross, he not only promises that the death of Christ
   will be glorious, but also mentions with commendation the numerous
   ornaments with which he had already adorned it.

   29. That it thundered. It was truly monstrous, that the assembled
   multitude were unmoved by so evident a miracle. Some are so deaf, that
   they hear as a confused sound what God had distinctly pronounced.
   Others are less dull of caring, but yet take away much from the majesty
   of the Divine voice, by pretending that it was an angel who spoke. But
   the same thing is practiced every day; for God speaks plainly enough in
   the Gospel, in which is also displayed the power and energy of the
   Spirit, which ought to shake heaven and earth; but many are as little
   affected by the doctrine, as if it only proceeded from a mortal man,
   and others consider the word of God to be confused and barbarous, as if
   it were nothing else than thunder.

   But a question arises: Did that voice sound from heaven without any
   profit or advantage? I reply, what the Evangelist here ascribes to the
   multitude belongs only to a part of them; for there were some besides
   the Apostles who did not interpret it so badly. But the Evangelist
   intended to point out briefly what is commonly done in the world; and
   that is, that the greater part of men, while they hear God, do not hear
   him though he speak plainly and distinctly.

   30. This voice came not for my sake. Had Christ no need of being
   strengthened, or did the Father care less for him than for us? But we
   must attend to this principle. As it was on our account that Christ
   clothed himself with flesh, so all the blessings which he received from
   the Father were bestowed on our account. Again, it is also true, that
   the voice came from heaven for the sake of the people; for he had no
   need of an outward miracle. Besides, there is here an indirect reproof,
   that the Jews are deaf like stones to the voice of God; for since God
   speaks for their sake, there can be no excuse for their ingratitude,
   when they do not lend their ears.

   31. Now is the judgment of this world. The Lord now, as if he had
   already succeeded in the contest, boasts of having obtained a victory
   not only over fear, but over death; for he describes, in lofty terms,
   the advantage of his death, which might have struck his disciples with
   consternation. Some view the word, judgment (prisis) as denoting
   reformation, and others, as denoting condemnation. I rather agree with
   the former who explain it to mean, that the world must be restored to a
   proper order; for the Hebrew word mspht, mishpat, which is translated
   judgment, means a well-ordered state. Now we know, that out of Christ
   there is nothing but confusion in the world; and though Christ had
   already begun to erect the kingdom of God, yet his death was the
   commencement of a well-regulated condition, and the full restoration of
   the world.

   Yet it must also be observed, that this proper arrangement cannot be
   established in the world, until the kingdom of Satan be first
   destroyed, until the flesh, and every thing opposed to the
   righteousness of God, be reduced to nothing. Lastly, the renovation of
   the world must be preceded by mortification. Accordingly, Christ
   declares:

   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out; for the confusion and
   deformity arise from this, that while Satan usurps tyrannical dominion,
   iniquity everywhere abounds. When Satan has been cast out, therefore,
   the world is brought back from its revolt, and placed under obedience
   to the government of God. It may be asked, how was Satan cast out by
   the death of Christ, since he does not cease to make war continually? I
   reply, this casting out must not be limited to any short period of
   time, but is a description of that remarkable effect of the death of
   Christ which is daily manifested.

   32. If I be lifted up. Next follows the method by which the judgment
   shall be conducted; namely, Christ, being lifted up on the cross, shall
   gather all men to himself, in order that he may raise them from earth
   to heaven. The Evangelist says, that Christ pointed out the manner of
   his death; and, therefore, the meaning undoubtedly is, that the cross
   will be, as it were, a chariot, by which he shall raise all men, along
   with himself, to his Father. It might have been thought, that at that
   time he was carried away from the earth, so as no longer to have any
   interests in common with men; but he declares, that he will go in a
   very different manner, so as to draw upwards to himself those who were
   fixed on the earth. Now, though he alludes to the form of his death,
   yet he means generally, that his death will not be a division to
   separate him from men, but that it will be an additional means of
   drawing earth upwards towards heaven.

   I will draw all men to myself. The word all, which he employs, must be
   understood to refer to the children of God, who belong to his flock.
   Yet I agree with Chrysostom, who says that Christ used the universal
   term, all, because the Church was to be gathered equally from among
   Gentiles and Jews, according to that saying,

   There shall be one shepherd, and one sheepfold,
   (John 10:16.)

   The old Latin translation has, I will draw all things to me; and
   Augustine maintains that we ought to read it in that manner; but the
   agreement of all the Greek manuscripts ought to have greater weight
   with us.

   John 12:34-36

   34. The multitude answered, We have heard from the law, that Christ
   remaineth for ever; and how sayest thou, that the Son of man must be
   lifted up.? Who is that Son of man? 35. Jesus therefore said to them,
   Yet a little while you have the light with you. Walk while you have the
   light, lest darkness overtake you; for he who walketh in darkness
   knoweth not whither he goeth. 36. While you have the light, believe in
   the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke
   Jesus, and went away, and hid himself from them.


   34. We have heard from the law. Their intention undoubtedly was, to
   carp malignantly at the words of Christ; and therefore their malice
   blinds them, so that they perceive nothing amidst the clearest light.
   They say that Jesus ought not to be regarded as the Christ, because he
   said that he would die, while the Law ascribes perpetuity to the
   Messiah; as if both statements had not been expressly made in the Law
   that Christ will die, and that afterwards his kingdom will flourish to
   the end of the world. But they seize on the second clause, and make it
   a ground of calumny. The origin of their error was, that they judged of
   the splendor of Messiah's kingdom according to their carnal views; in
   consequence of which, they reject Christ because he does not correspond
   to their foolish notion. Under the term the Law they embrace also the
   Prophets, and the present tense -- remaineth -- -is used, agreeably to
   the Hebrew idiom, instead of the future tense, will remain

   Who is that Son of man? This is a reproachful question, as if that
   short refutation vanquished Christ so completely that he had nothing
   more to say. [27] This shows how haughty their ignorance was; for it is
   as if they had said, "Go now, and boast that thou art the Christ, since
   thine own confession proves that thou hast nothing to do with the
   Messiah."

   35. Yet a little while the light is with you. Though in this reply the
   Lord gently admonishes them, yet at the same time he reproves them
   sharply; for he charges them with shutting their eyes against the
   light, and at the same time threatens that ere long the light will be
   taken away from them. When he says that yet a little while there is
   some remaining light, he confirms what he had already said about his
   death; for though by the light he does not mean his bodily presence,
   but his Gospel, yet he alludes to his departure; as if he had said,
   When I shall have gone away, I will not cease to be the light, and thus
   my glory will not be diminished through your darkness. When he says
   that the light is with them, he indirectly reproves them for closing
   their eyes and shutting out the light; and thus he declares that they
   do not deserve an answer to their objection, because of their own
   accord they seek an opportunity of falling into error.

   Walk while you have the light lest darkness overtake you. This
   statement, that the light does not continue to shine on them but for a
   little while, Applies equally to all unbelievers; for Scripture
   promises that to the children of God the Sun of righteousness (Malachi
   4:2) will rise, and will never go down.

   The sun shall no longer be your light by day, nor the moon by night,
   but the Lord shall be your everlasting light,
   (Isaiah 60:19.)

   But all ought to walk cautiously, because contempt of the light is
   followed by darkness. This, too, is the reason why night so thick and
   dark sat down on the world for many centuries. It was because there
   were few who deigned to walk in the brightness of heavenly wisdom; for
   Christ enlightens us by his Gospel, in order that we may follow the way
   of salvation, which he points out to us. For this reason, they who do
   not avail themselves of the grace of God extinguish, as far as lies in
   their power, the light which is offered to them.

   And he who walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth. To strike
   them with still deeper alarm, he reminds them how wretched is the
   condition of those who, being destitute of light, do nothing but wander
   throughout the whole course of, their life. For they cannot move a step
   without the risk of falling or even of destruction. But now Christ
   declares that we are in darkness, unless he shine upon us. Hence infer
   what is the value of the sagacity of the human mind, when it is the
   sole guide and instructor, apart from Christ.

   36. Believe in the light. He exhorts them to retain by faith the
   possession of the light, for he gives the appellation, children of
   light, to those who, like true heirs, enjoy it to the end.

   These things spoke Jesus. We might have wondered why he withdrew
   himself from them, when they were so eager to receive him; but from the
   other Evangelists it may easily be inferred that what is here said
   relates to adversaries, who burned with envy on account of the godly
   zeal of good and sincere disciples. For the strangers, who had gone out
   to meet Christ, followed him even to the temple, where he met with the
   saints and with the multitude of the inhabitants of the town.

   John 12:37-41

   37. And though he had done so many signs in their presence, they
   believed not in him: 38. That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be
   fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? [28] and
   to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 39. Therefore they
   could not believe, because Isaiah saith again, 40. He hath blinded
   their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their
   eyes, and under- stand with their heart, and be converted, and I should
   heal them. 41. These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and
   spoke of him.


   37. And though he had done so many signs. That no man may be disturbed
   or perplexed at seeing that Christ was despised by the Jews, the
   Evangelist removes this offense, by showing that he was supported by
   clear and undoubted testimonies, which proved that credit was due to
   him and to his doctrine; but that the blind did not behold the glory
   and power of God, which were openly displayed in his miracles. First,
   therefore, we ought to believe that it was not owing to Christ that the
   Jews did not place confidence in him, because by many miracles he
   abundantly testified who he was, and that it was therefore unjust and
   highly unreasonable that their unbelief should diminish his authority.
   But as this very circumstance might lead many persons to anxious and
   perplexing inquiry how the Jews came to be so stupid, that the power of
   God, though visible, produced no effect upon them, John proceeds
   further, and shows that faith does not proceed from the ordinary
   faculties of men, but is an uncommon and extraordinary gift of God, and
   that this was anciently predicted concerning Christ, that very few
   would believe the Gospel.

   38. That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled. John does
   not mean that the prediction laid a necessity on the Jews; for Isaiah
   (Isaiah 53:1; Romans 10:16) uttered nothing but what the Lord revealed
   to him from the secret treasures of his purpose. Indeed, it must have
   happened, though the prophet had not spoken of it; but as men would not
   have known what should take place, if God had not testified by the
   mouth of the prophet, the Evangelist places before our eyes in the
   prediction, as in a mirror, what would otherwise have appeared to men
   obscure and almost incredible.

   Lord, who hath believed? This sentence contains two clauses. In the
   former, Isaiah, having begun to speak of Christ, fore-seeing that all
   that he proclaims concerning Christ, and all that shall afterwards be
   made known by the Apostles, will be generally rejected by the Jews,
   exclaims, as if in astonishment at something strange and monstrous,
   Lord, who shall believe our report, or, our speech? [29]

   To whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? In this second clause
   he assigns the reason why they are few; and that reason is, that men do
   not attain it by their own strength, and God does not illuminate all
   without distinction, but bestows the grace of his Holy Spirit on very
   few, [30] And if among the Jews the obstinate unbelief of many ought
   not to have been an obstacle to believers, though they were few in
   number, the same argument ought to persuade us, at the present day, not
   to be ashamed of the Gospel, though it has few disciples. But we ought
   first to observe the reason which is added, that what makes men
   believers is not their own sagacity, but the revelation of God. The
   word arm, it is well known, denotes power. The prophet declares that
   the arm of God, which is contained in the doctrine of the Gospel, lies
   hid until it is revealed, and at the same time testifies that all are
   not indiscriminately partakers of this revelation. Hence it follows,
   that many are left in their blindness destitute of inward light,
   because hearing they do not hear, (Matthew 13:13.)

   39. Therefore they could not believe. This is somewhat more harsh;
   because, if the words be taken in their natural meaning, the way was
   shut up against the Jews, and the power of believing was taken from
   them, because the prediction of the prophet adjudged them to blindness,
   before they determined what choice they should make. I reply, there is
   no absurdity in this, if nothing could happen different from what God
   had foreseen. But it ought to be observed, that the mere foreknowledge
   of God is not in itself the cause of events; though, in this passage,
   we ought to consider not so much the foreknowledge of God as his
   justice and vengeance. For God declares not what he beholds from heaven
   that men will do, but what He himself will do; and that is, that he
   will strike wicked men with giddiness and stupidity, and thus will take
   vengeance on their obstinate wickedness. In this passage he points out
   the nearer and inferior cause why God intends that his word, which is
   in its own nature salutary and quickening, shall be destructive and
   deadly to the Jews. It is because they deserved it by their obstinate
   wickedness.

   This punishment it was impossible for them to escape, because God had
   once decreed to give them over to a reprobate mind, and to change the
   light of his word, so as to make it darkness to them. For this latter
   prediction differs from the former in this respect, that in the former
   passage the prophet testifies that none believe but those whom God, of
   his free grace, enlightens for his own good pleasure, the reason of
   which does not appear; for since all are equally ruined, God, of his
   mere good pleasure, distinguishes from others those whom he thinks fit
   to distinguish. But, in the latter passage, he speaks of the hardness
   by which God has punished the wickedness of an ungrateful people. They
   who do not attend to these steps mistake and confound passages of
   Scripture, which are quite different from each other.

   40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart. The passage
   is taken from Isaiah 6:9, where the Lord forewarns the prophet, that
   the labor which he spends in instructing will lead to no other result
   than to make the people worse. First then he says, Go, and tell this
   people, Hearing, hear and do not hear; as if he had said, "I send thee
   to speak to the deaf." He afterwards adds, Harden the heart of this
   people, &c. By these words he means, that he intends to make his word a
   punishment to the reprobate, that it may render them more thoroughly
   blind, and that their blindness may be plunged in deeper darkness. It
   is indeed a dreadful judgment of God, when He overwhelms men by the
   light of doctrine, in such a manner as to deprive them of all
   understanding; and when, even by means of that which is their only
   light, he brings darkness upon them.

   But it ought to be observed, that it is accidental to the word of God,
   that it blinds men; for nothing can be more inconsistent than that
   there should be no difference between truth and falsehood, that the
   bread of life should become a deadly poison, and that medicine should
   aggravate a disease. But this must be ascribed to the wickedness of
   men, which turns life into death. It ought also to be observed, that
   sometimes the Lord, by himself, blinds the minds of men, by depriving
   them of judgment and understanding; sometimes by Satan and false
   prophets, when he maddens them by their impostures; sometimes. too by
   his ministers, when the doctrine of salvation is injurious and deadly
   to them. But provided that prophets labor faithfully in the work of
   instruction, and commit to the Lord the result of their labor, though
   they may not succeed to their wish, they ought not to give way or
   despond. Let them rather be satisfied with knowing that God approves of
   their labor, though it be useless to men' and that even the savor of
   doctrine, which wicked men render deadly to themselves elves, is good
   and pleasant to God, as Paul testifies, (2 Corinthians 2:15.)

   The heart is sometimes in Scripture put for the seat of the affections;
   but here, as in many other passages, it denotes what is called the
   intellectual part of the soul. To the same purpose Moses speaks:

   God hath not given you a heart to understand,
   (Deuteronomy 29:4.)

   Lest they should see with their eyes. Let us remember that the prophet
   speaks of unbelievers who had already rejected the grace of God. It is
   certain that all would continue to be such by nature, if The Lord did
   not form to obedience to him those whom he has elected. At first,
   therefore, the condition of men is equal and alike, but when reprobate
   men have, of their own accord, and by their own wickedness, rebelled
   against God, they subject themselves to this vengeance, by which, being
   given up to a reprobate mind, they continually rush forward more and
   more to their own destruction. It is their own fault, therefore, if God
   does not choose to convert them, because they were the cause of their
   own despair. We are briefly instructed also, by these words of the
   prophet, what is the beginning of our conversion to God. It is when he
   enlightens the hearts, which must have been turned away from him, so
   long as they were held by the darkness of Satan; but, on the contrary,
   such is the power of Divine light, that it attracts us to itself, and
   forms us to the image of God.

   And I should heal them. He next adds the fruit of conversion, that is,
   healing. By this word the prophet means the blessing of God and a
   prosperous condition, and likewise deliverance from all the miseries
   which spring from the wrath of God. Now, if this happens to the
   reprobate, contrary to the nature of the word, we ought to attend to
   the contrast implied in the, opposite use of it; namely, that the
   purpose for which the word of God is preached is, to enlighten us in
   the true knowledge of God, to turn us to God, and reconcile us to him,
   that we may be happy and blessed.

   41. These things spoke Jesus. Lest readers should think that this
   prediction was inappropriately quoted, John expressly states, that the
   prophet was not sent as a teacher to a single age, but, on the
   contrary, that the glory of Christ was exhibited to him, that he might
   be a witness of those things which should take place under his reign.
   Now the Evangelist takes for granted, that Isaiah saw the glory of
   Christ; and hence he infers, that Isaiah accommodates his instruction
   to the future state of Christ's kingdom.

   John 12:42-46

   42. Nevertheless, many of the rulers believed on him, but on account of
   the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be cast out of
   the synagogue. 43. For they loved the glory of men more than the glory
   of God. 44. And Jesus stood, and said, He who believeth on me,
   believeth not on me, but on him who sent me; 45. And he who seeth me
   seeth him that sent me. 46. I am come into the world as a light, that
   whosoever believeth on me may not remain in darkness.


   Nevertheless, many even of the rulers believed on Him. The murmuring
   and fierceness of the Jews, in rejecting Christ, having risen to such a
   height of insolence, it might have been thought that all the people,
   without exception, conspired against him. But the Evangelist says that,
   amidst the general madness of the nation, there were many who were of a
   sound mind. A striking instance, truly, of the grace of God; for, when
   ungodliness has once prevailed, it is a sort of universal plague, which
   infects with its contagion every part of the body. It is therefore a
   remarkable gift, and special grace of God, when, amidst a people so
   corrupt, there are some who remain untainted. And yet we now perceive
   in the world the same grace of God; for though ungodliness and contempt
   of God abound everywhere, and though a vast multitude of men make
   furious attempts to exterminate utterly the doctrine of the Gospel, yet
   it always finds some places of retreat; and thus faith has -- what may
   be called -- its harbors or places of refuge, that it may not be
   entirely banished from the world.

   The word even is emphatic; for in the order of the rulers, there
   existed so deep and inveterate a hatred of the Gospel, that it could
   scarcely be believed that a single believer could be found amongst
   them. So much the greater admiration was due to the power of the Spirit
   of God, which entered where no opening was made; though it was not a
   vice, peculiar to a single age, that rulers were rebellious and
   disobedient to Christ; for honor, and wealth, and high rank, are
   usually accompanied by pride. The consequence is, that they who,
   swelled with arrogance, scarcely acknowledge themselves to be men, are
   not easily subdued by voluntary humility. Whoever, then, holds a high
   station in the world, will, if he is wise, look with suspicion on his
   rank, that it may not stand in his way. When the Evangelist says that
   there were many, this must not be understood as if they were the
   majority or the half; for, as compared with others who were vastly
   numerous, they were few, but yet they were many, when viewed in
   themselves.

   On account of the Pharisees. It may be thought that he speaks
   incorrectly, when he separates faith from confession; for

   with the heart we believe to righteousness,
   and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,
   (Romans 10:10)

   and it is impossible that the faith, which has been kindled in the
   heart, shall not put forth its flame. I reply, he points out here how
   weak was the faith of those men who were so lukewarm, or rather cold.
   In short, John means that they embraced the doctrine of Christ, because
   they knew that it had come from God, but that they have not a lively
   faith, or a faith so vigorous as it ought to have been; for Christ does
   not grant to his followers a spirit of fear, but of firmness, that they
   may boldly and fearlessly confess what they have learned from him. Yet
   I do not think that they were altogether silent; but as their
   confession was not sufficiently open, the Evangelist, in my opinion,
   simply declares that they did not make profession of their faith; for
   the proper kind of profession was, openly to declare that they were the
   disciples of Christ. Let no man, therefore, flatter himself who, in any
   respect, conceals or dissembles his faith for fear of incurring the
   hatred of men; for however hateful the name of Christ may be, that
   cowardice which compels us to turn aside, in the smallest degree, from
   the confession of him, admits of no excuse.

   It must also be observed, that rulers have less rigor and firmness,
   because ambition almost always reigns in them, which is the most
   slavish of all dispositions; and, to express it in a single word,
   earthly honors may be said to be golden fetters, which bind a man, so
   that he cannot perform his duty with freedom. On this account, persons
   who are placed in a low and mean condition ought to bear their lot with
   the greater patience, for they are, at least, delivered from many very
   bad snares. Yet the great and noble ought to struggle against their
   high rank, that it may not hinder them from submitting to Christ.

   John says that they were afraid of the Pharisees; not that the other
   scribes and priests freely permitted any man to call himself a disciple
   of Christ, but because, under the semblance of zeal, cruelty burned in
   them with greater fierceness. Zeal, in defending religion, is, indeed,
   an excellent virtue; but if hypocrisy be added to it, no plague can be
   more dangerous. So much the more earnestly ought we to entreat the Lord
   to guide us by the unerring rule of his Spirit.

   Lest they should be thrown out of the synagogue. This was what hindered
   them, the fear of disgrace; for they would have been thrown out of the
   synagogue. Hence we see how great is the perversity of men, which not
   only corrupts and debases the best of God's ordinances, but turns them
   into destructive tyranny. Excommunication ought to have been the sinew
   of holy discipline, that punishment might be ready to be inflicted, if
   any person despised the Church. But matters had come to such a pitch,
   that any one who confessed that he belonged to Christ was banished from
   the society of believers. In like manner, at the present day, the Pope,
   in order to exercise the same kind of tyranny, falsely pretends to a
   right of excommunicating, and not only thunders with blind rage against
   all the godly, but endeavors to cast down Christ from his heavenly
   throne; and yet he does not hesitate impudently to hold out the right
   of sacred jurisdiction, with which Christ has adorned his Church.

   43. For they loved the glory of men. The Evangelist expressly states
   that those men were not guided by any superstition, but only endeavored
   to avoid disgrace among men; for if ambition had greater influence over
   them than the fear of God, it follows, that it was no vain scruple of
   conscience that gave them uneasiness. Now, let the reader observe how
   great ignominy is incurred before God, by the cowardice of those who,
   from the fear of being hated, dissemble their faith before men. Can any
   thing be more foolish, or rather, can any thing be more beastly, than
   to prefer the silly applause of men to the judgment of God? But he
   declares that all who shrink from the hatred of men, when the pure
   faith ought to be confessed, are seized with this kind of madness. And
   justly; for the apostle, in applauding the unshaken steadiness of
   Moses, says that

   he remained firm, as if he had seen him who is invisible,
   (Hebrews 11:27.)

   By these words he means that, when any person has fixed his eyes on
   God, his heart will be invincible, and utterly incapable of being
   moved.

   Whence, therefore, comes the effeminacy [31] , which causes us to give
   way to treacherous hypocrisy, but because, at the sight of the world,
   all our senses grow dull? For a true sight of God would instantly chase
   away all the mists of wealth and honors. Away with those who look upon
   an indirect denial of Christ as some trivial offense, or, as they call
   it, a venial sin! For, on the contrary, the Holy Spirit declares that
   it is more base and monstrous than if heaven and earth were mingled.

   To love the glory of men means, in this passage, to desire to enjoy
   reputation among men. The Evangelist, therefore, means, that those men
   were so much devoted to the world, that they were more desirous to
   please men than to please God. Besides, when he accuses of this crime
   those who denied Christ, he, at the same time, shows that the
   excommunication, which the priests abused, contrary to all that was
   right and lawful, had no value or efficacy. Let us know, therefore,
   that all the excommunications which the Pope now mutters against us are
   mere bugbears to frighten children, [32] since we are fully convinced,
   in our own consciences, that he aims at nothing else than to lead us
   away from Christ.

   44. And Jesus cried. The object of Christ, in this statement, is to
   encourage his followers to a proper and unshaken steadfastness of
   faith; but it contains also an implied reproof, by which he intended to
   correct that perverse fear. The cry is expressive of vehemence; for it
   is not a simple doctrine, but an exhortation intended to excite them
   more powerfully. The statement amounts to this, that faith in Christ
   does not rely on any mortal man, but on God; for it finds in Christ
   nothing but what is divine, or rather, it beholds God in his face.
   Hence he infers, that it is foolish and unreasonable for faith to be
   wavering or doubtful; for it is impossible to offer a greater insult to
   God, than not to rely on his truth. Who is it then that has duly
   profited by the Gospel? It is he who, relying or this confidence, that
   he does not believe men but God, quietly and steadily contends against
   all the machinations of Satan. If, then, we would render to God the
   honor due to him, we must learn to remain firm in faith, not only
   though the world were shaken, but even though Satan should disturb and
   overturn all that is under heaven.

   He that believeth on me believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
   Believers are said not to believe on Christ, when they do not fix their
   whole attention on his human countenance. Comparing himself with the
   Father, he bids us look at the power of God; for the weakness of the
   flesh has no firmness in

   itself. When we shall, afterwards, find him exhorting the disciples to
   believe on him, it will be in a different sense; for, in that passage,
   God is not contrasted with man, but Christ is brought forward with all
   his gifts and graces [33] which ought to be sufficient for upholding
   our faith.

   45. And he who seeth me. The word see is here taken for knowledge; for,
   in order to give true and thorough tranquillity to our consciences,
   which would otherwise have been constantly liable to various
   agitations, he sends us to the Father. The reason why the stability of
   faith is firm and secure is, that it is stronger than the world, and is
   above the world. [34] Now, when Christ is truly known, the glory of God
   shines in him, that we may be fully persuaded that the faith which we
   have in him does not depend on man, but that it is founded on the
   eternal God; for it rises from the flesh of Christ to his Divinity.
   And, if it be so, not only must it be fixed perpetually in our hearts,
   but it must likewise show itself boldly in the tongue, when it is
   necessary.

   46. I am come into the world as a light. In order to render his
   disciples more bold and persevering, he proceeds still farther in
   maintaining the certainty of faith. And, first, he testifies that he
   came into the world to be a light, by which men might be delivered from
   darkness and errors; and, at the same time, he points out the means of
   obtaining so great a benefit, when he says, that whosoever believeth in
   me may not remain in darkness. Besides, he accuses of ingratitude all
   who, after having been taught by the Gospel, do not separate themselves
   from unbelievers; for the higher the excellence of this benefit, of
   being called from darkness to light, the less excusable are they who,
   through their indolence or carelessness, quench the light that had been
   kindled in them.

   The words, I am come into the world as a light, are highly emphatic;
   for though Christ was a light from the beginning, yet there is a good
   reason why he adorns himself with this title, that he has come to
   perform the part of a light. That we may perceive distinctly the
   various steps, he shows, first, that he is a light to others rather
   than to himself; secondly, that he is a light, not only to angels, but
   also to men; thirdly, that he was manifested in the flesh, in order
   that he might shine with full brightness.

   The term, whosoever, appears to have been added on purpose, partly,
   that all believers, without exception, may enjoy this benefit ill
   common, and partly, to show that the reason why unbelievers perish in
   darkness is, that, of their own accord, they forsake the light. Now, if
   the whole wisdom of the world were collected into one mass, not a
   single ray of the true light would be found in that vast heap; but,
   contrary, it will be a confused chaos; for it belongs to Christ alone
   to deliver us from darkness.

   John 12:47-50

   47. And if any man hear my words, and do not believe them, [35] I do
   not judge him; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the
   world. 48. He who rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one
   who judgeth him. The word which I have spoken shall judge him at the
   last day. 49. For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who
   hath sent me hath given me a commandment what to say and what to speak.
   50. And I know that his commandment is eternal life: those things,
   therefore, which I speak, I speak as my Father hath told me.


   47. If any man hear my words. After having spoken concerning his grace,
   and exhorted his disciples to steady faith, he now begins to strike the
   rebellious, though even here he mitigates the severity due to the
   wickedness of those who deliberately -- as it were -- reject God; for
   he delays to pronounce judgment on them, because, on the contrary, he
   has come for the salvation of all. In the first place, we ought to
   understand that he does not speak here of all unbelievers without
   distinction, but of those who, knowingly and willingly, reject the
   doctrine of the Gospel which has been exhibited to them. Why then does
   Christ not choose to condemn them? It is because he lays aside for a
   time the office of a judge, and offers salvation to all without
   reserve, and stretches out his arms to embrace all, that all may be the
   more encouraged to repent. And yet there is a circumstance of no small
   moment, by which he points out the aggravation of the crime, if they
   reject an invitation so kind and gracious, for it is as if he had said,
   "Lo, I am here to invite all, and, forgetting the character of a judge,
   I have this as my single object, to persuade all, and to rescue from
   destruction those who are already twice ruined." No man, therefore, is
   condemned on account of having despised the Gospel, except he who,
   disdaining the lovely message of salvation, has chosen of his own
   accord to draw down destruction on himself.

   The word judge, as is evident from the word save, which is contrasted
   with it, here signifies to condemn. Now this ought to be understood as
   referring to the office which properly and naturally belongs to Christ;
   for that unbelievers are not more severely condemned on account of the
   Gospel is accidental, and does not arise from its nature, as we have
   said on former occasions.

   48. He who rejecteth me. That wicked men may not flatter themselves as
   if their unbounded disobedience to Christ would pass unpunished, he,
   adds here a dreadful threatening, that though he were to do nothing in
   this matter, yet his doctrine alone would be sufficient to condemn
   them, as he says elsewhere, that there would be no need of any other
   judge than Moses, in whom they boasted, (John 5:45.) The meaning,
   therefore, is: "Burning with ardent desire to promote your salvation, I
   do indeed abstain from exercising my right to condemn you, and am
   entirely employed in saving what is lost; but do not think that you
   have escaped out of the hands of God; for though I should altogether
   hold my peace, the word alone, which you have despised, is sufficient
   to judge you."

   And receiveth not my words. This latter clause is an explanation of the
   former; for since hypocrisy is natural to men, nothing is easier for
   them than to boast in words that they are ready to receive Christ; and
   we see how common this boasting is even amongst the most wicked men. We
   must therefore attend to this definition, that Christ is rejected when
   we do not embrace the pure doctrine of the Gospel.

   Loudly do the Papists, indeed, proclaim this word which Christ uttered;
   but as soon as his pure truth is brought forward, nothing is more
   hateful to them. Such persons kiss Christ in the same manner as Judas
   kissed him, (Matthew 26:49.) Let us therefore learn to receive him
   along with his word, and to render to him that homage and obedience
   which he demands as his sole right.

   The word which I speak shall judge you at the last day. It is
   impossible to give a nobler or more magnificent title to the Gospel
   than to, ascribe to it the power of judging; for, according to these
   words, the last judgment shall be nothing else than an approbation or
   ratification [36] of the doctrine of the Gospel. Christ himself will
   indeed ascend the tribunal, but he declares that he will pronounce the
   sentence according to the word which is now preached. This threatening
   ought to strike deep? terror into the ungodly, since they cannot escape
   the judgment of that doctrine which they now so haughtily disdain.

   But when Christ mentions the last judgment, he means that they are now
   destitute of understanding; for he reminds them that the punishment
   which they now treat with mockery will then be openly displayed. On the
   other hand, it yields to the godly an invaluable consolation, that to
   whatever extent. they may be now condemned by the world, still they do
   not doubt that they are already acquitted in heaven; for, wherever the
   faith of the Gospel has its seat, the tribunal of God is erected to
   save. Relying on this right, we need not trouble ourselves about
   Papists or their absurd decisions; for our faith rises even above
   angels.

   49. For I do not speak from myself. That the outward appearance of man
   may not lessen the majesty of God, Christ frequently sends us to the
   Father. This is the reason why he so often mentions the Father; and,
   indeed, since it would be unlawful to transfer to another a single
   spark of the Divine glory, the word, to which judgment is ascribed,
   must have proceeded from God. Now Christ here distinguishes himself
   from the Father, not simply as to his Divine Person, but rather as to
   his flesh; lest the doctrine should be judged after the manner of men,
   and, therefore, should have less weight. But if consciences were
   subject to the laws and doctrine of men, this argument of Christ would
   not apply, "My word (he says) will judge, because it has not proceeded
   from man;" according to that saying,

   There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy,
   (James 4:12.)

   We may likewise infer from it, how monstrous, is the sacrilege of the
   Pope in daring to bind souls by his inventions; for in this way he
   claims more for himself than the Son of God does, who declares that he
   does not speak but by the commandment of his Father.

   50. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. He again applauds
   the fruit of his doctrine, that all may more willingly yield to it; and
   it is reasonable that wicked men should feel the vengeance of God, whom
   they now refuse to have as the Author of life.

   CHAPTER 13
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 13:1-7

   1. Before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour was
   come, that he should remove out of this world to the Father, having
   loved his own, who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 2. And
   after supper, [37] the devil having already put it into the heart of
   Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him, 3. Jesus, knowing that
   the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come
   from God, and was going to God, 4. Riseth from supper, and layeth aside
   his garments, and, taking a towel, he girdeth himself. 5. Then he
   poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of his
   disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 6.
   He cometh, therefore, to Simon Peter, who saith to him, Lord, dost thou
   wash my feet? 7. Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest
   not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.


   1. Before the feast of the passover. John intentionally passes by many
   things which, he knew, had been related by Matthew and others. He
   undertakes to explain those circumstances which they had left out, one
   of which was the narrative of the washing of feet. And though he will
   afterwards explain more clearly for what purpose Christ washed the feet
   of his disciples, yet, before doing so, he states, in a single word,
   that the Lord testified, by this visible sign, that the love with which
   he embraced them was firm and lasting; that, though they were deprived
   of his presence, they might still be convinced that death itself would
   not quench this love. This conviction ought now to be fixed also in our
   hearts.

   The words are, that Christ loved even to the end his own, who were in
   the world. Why does he employ this circumlocution in describing the
   Apostles, but in order to inform us that, in consequence of their being
   engaged, as we are, in a hazardous and difficult warfare, Christ
   regarded them with so much the greater solicitude? And, therefore,
   though we think that we are at a distance from Christ, yet we ought to
   know that he is looking at us; for he loveth his own, who are in the
   world; for we, have no reason to doubt that he still bears the same
   affection which he retained at the very moment of his death.

   To remove from this world to the Father. This phrase is worthy of
   notice; for it refers to the knowledge of Christ, that he knew that his
   death was a passage to the heavenly kingdom of God. And if, while he
   was hastening thither, he did not cease to regard his own with his
   wonted love, there is no reason why we should now think that his
   affection is changed. Now, since he is the first-born from the dead,
   this definition of death applies to the whole body of the Church, that
   it is an opening or passage to go to God, from whom believers are now
   absent. [38]

   2. After supper. [39] We shall afterwards take into consideration, at
   the proper place, the whole of Christ's design in washing the feet of
   his disciples, and the advantage to be derived from this narrative. Let
   us now attend to the connection of the words. The Evangelist says that
   this was done, while Judas already resolved to betray Christ, not only
   to show the wonderful patience of Christ, who could endure to wash the
   feet of such a wicked and detestable traitor; but also that he
   purposely selected the time when he was near death, for performing what
   may be regarded as the last act of his life.

   The devil having already put it into the heart of Judas. When the
   Evangelist says that Judas had been impelled by the devil to form the
   design of betraying Christ, this tends to show the enormity of the
   crime; for it was dreadful and most atrocious wickedness, in which the
   efficacy of Satan was openly displayed. There is no wickedness, indeed,
   that is perpetrated by men, to which Satan does not excite them, but
   the more hideous and execrable any crime is, the more ought we to view
   in it the rage of the devil, who drives about, in all possible
   directions, [40] men who have been forsaken by God. But though the lust
   of men is kindled into a fiercer flame by Satan's fan, still it does
   not cease to be a furnace; it contains the flame kindled within itself,
   it receives with avidity the agitation of the fan, so that no excuse is
   left for wicked men.

   3. Jesus, knoweth that the Father had given all things into his hands.
   I am of opinion that this was added for the purpose of informing us
   whence Christ obtained such a well-regulated composure of mind. It was
   because, having already obtained a victory over death, he raised his
   mind to the glorious triumph which was speedily to follow. It usually
   happens, that men seized with fear are greatly agitated. The Evangelist
   means, that no agitation of this sort was to be found in Christ,
   because, though he was to be immediately betrayed by Judas, still he
   knew that the Father had given all things into his hand. It may be
   asked, How then was he reduced to such a degree of sadness that he
   sweat blood? I reply, both were necessary. It was necessary that he
   should have a dread of death, and it was necessary that,
   notwithstanding of this, he should fearlessly discharge every thing
   that belonged to the office of the Mediator.

   4. And layeth aside his garments. The meaning is, that he laid aside
   his upper garment, not his coat; for we know that the inhabitants of
   Eastern countries wore long garments

   5. And began to wash the feet of his disciples. These words express the
   design of Christ, rather than the outward act; for the Evangelist adds,
   that he began with Peter.

   6. Lord, dost thou wash my feet? This speech expresses strong dislike
   of the action as foolish and unsuitable; for by asking what Christ is
   doing, he puts out his hand, as it were, to push him back. The modesty
   would be worthy of commendation, were it not that obedience is of
   greater value in the sight of God than any kind of honor or service, or
   rather, if this were not the true and only rule of humility, to yield
   ourselves in obedience to God, and to have all our senses regulated by
   his good pleasure, so that every thing which he declares to be
   agreeable to Him shall also be approved by us, without any scruple. We
   ought, therefore, above all, to observe this rule of serving God, that
   we shall be always ready to acquiesce, without delay, as soon as he
   issues any command.

   7. What I do. We are taught by these words, that we ought simply to
   obey Christ, even though we should not perceive the reason why he
   wishes this or that thing to be done. In a well-regulated house, one
   person, the head of the family, has the sole fight to say what ought to
   be done; and the servants are bound to employ their hands and feet in
   his service. That man, therefore, is too haughty, who refuses to obey
   the command of God, because he does not know the reason of it. But this
   admonition has a still more extensive meaning, and that is, that we
   should not take it ill to be ignorant of those things which God wishes
   to be hidden from us for a time; for this kind of ignorance is more
   learned than any other kind of knowledge, when we permit God to be wise
   above us.

   John 13:8-11

   8. Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered
   him, If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me. 9. Simon
   Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my
   head. 10. Jesus saith to, him, lie who is washed needeth not to wash
   more than his feet, but is altogether clean; and you are clean, but not
   all. 11. For he knew who it was that should betray him; [41] therefore
   he said, You are not all clean.


   8. Thou shalt never wash my feet. Hitherto Peter's modesty was
   excusable, though it was not free from blame; but now he errs more
   grievously, when he has been corrected, and yet does not yield. [42]
   And, indeed, it is a common fault, that ignorance is closely followed
   by obstinacy. It is a plausible excuse, no doubt, that the refusal
   springs from reverence for Christ; but since he does not absolutely
   obey the injunction, the very desire of showing his respect for Christ
   loses all its gracefulness. The true wisdom of faith, therefore, is to
   approve and embrace with reverence whatever proceeds from God, as done
   with propriety and in good order; nor is there any other way, indeed,
   in which his name can be sanctified by us; for if we do not believe
   that whatever he does is done for a very good reason: our flesh, being
   naturally stubborn, will continually murmur, and will not render to God
   the honor due to him, unless by constraint. In short, until a man
   renounce the liberty of judging as to the works of God, whatever
   exertions he may make to honor God, still pride will always lurk under
   the garb of humility.

   If I wash thee not. This reply of Christ does not yet explain the
   reason why he resolved to wash the feet of his disciples; only by a
   comparison drawn from the soul to the body, he shows that, in washing
   the feet of his disciples, he does nothing that is unusual or
   inconsistent with his rank. Meanwhile, the reply points out the folly
   of Peter's wisdom. The same thing will always happen to us, whenever
   the Lord begins to contend with us. So long as he remains silent, men
   imagine that they have a good right to differ from him: but nothing is
   easier far him than to refute, by a single word, all the plausible
   arguments which they employ. As Christ is Lord and Master, Peter thinks
   it inconsistent that Christ should wash his feet. But the evil is, [43]
   that, in refusing such a service, he rejects the principal part of his
   own salvation. There is also a general doctrine contained in this
   statement, that we are all filthy and abominable in the sight of God,
   until Christ wash away our stains. Now, since he claims for himself the
   exclusive right of washing, let every man present himself, o be
   cleansed from his pollution, that he may obtain a place among the
   children of God.

   But before proceeding farther, we must understand what is the meaning
   of the word wash. Some refer it to the free pardon of sins; others, to
   newness of life; while a third class extends it to. both, and this last
   view I cheerfully admit. For Christ washes us when he removes the guilt
   of our sins by his atoning sacrifice, that they may not come into
   judgment before God; and, on the other hand, he washes us when he takes
   away, by his Spirit, the wicked and sinful desires of the flesh. But as
   it will shortly afterwards be evident from what follows, that he speaks
   of the grace of regeneration, I do not absolutely maintain the opinion
   that he included here the washing of pardon.

   9. Lord, not my feet only. When Peter heard that he was ruined, if he
   did not accept the cleansing which was offered to him by Christ, this
   necessity proved, at length, to be a sufficient instructor to tame him.
   He therefore lays aside opposition and yields, but wishes to be
   entirely washed, and, indeed, acknowledges that, for his own part, he
   is altogether covered with pollution, and, therefore, that it is doing
   nothing, if he be only washed in one part. But here too he goes wrong
   through thoughtlessness, in treating, as a thing of no value, the
   benefit which he had already received; for he speaks as if he had not
   yet obtained any pardon of sins, or any sanctification by the Holy
   Spirit. On this account, Christ justly reproves him, for he recalls to
   his recollection what he had formerly bestowed on him; at the same
   time, reminding all his disciples in the person of one man, that, while
   they remembered the grace which they had received, they should consider
   what they still needed for the future.

   10. He who is washed needeth not to wash more than his feet, but is
   altogether clean. First, he says that believers are altogether clean;
   not that they are in every respect pure, so that there no longer
   remains in them any stain, but because they are cleansed in their chief
   part; that is, when sin is deprived of its kingly power, so that the
   righteousness of God holds the superiority; just as if we were to say,
   that a body was altogether healthy, Because it was not infected with
   any universal disease. It is by newness of life, therefore, that we
   must testify ourselves to be the disciples of Christ, for he declares
   that he is the Author of purity in all his followers.

   Again, the other comparison was also applied to the case in hand, that
   Peter might not set aside the washing of the feet as foolish; for, as
   Christ washes from the head to the feet, those whom he receives as his
   disciples, so, in those whom he has cleansed, the lower part remains to
   be daily cleansed. The children of God are not altogether regenerated
   on the first day, so as to aim at nothing but the heavenly life; but,
   on the contrary, the remains of the flesh continue to dwell in them,
   with which they maintain a continued struggle throughout their whole
   life. The term feet, therefore, is metaphorically applied to all the
   passions and cares by which we are brought into contact with the world;
   for, if the Holy Spirit occupied every part of us, we would no longer
   have anything to do with the pollutions of the world; but now, by that
   part in which we are carnal, we creep on the ground, or at least fix
   our feet in the clay, and, therefor are to some extent unclean. Thus
   Christ always finds in us something to cleanse. What is here spoken of
   is not the forgiveness of sins, but the renewal, by which Christ, by
   gradual and uninterrupted succession, delivers his followers entirely
   from the sinful desires of the flesh.

   And you are clean. This proposition may be said to be the minor in the
   syllogism, and hence it follows that the washing of the feet applies to
   them with strict propriety.

   But not all. This exception is added, that every one may examine
   himself, if Judas may perhaps be moved by a feeling of repentance;
   though he intended by it to take an early opportunity of fortifying the
   rest of the disciples, that they might not be perplexed by the atrocity
   of the crime, which was soon afterwards to be made known. Yet he
   purposely abstains from naming him, that he may not shut against him
   the gate of repentance. As that hardened hypocrite [44] was utterly
   desperate, the warning served only to aggravate his guilt; but it was
   of great advantage to the other disciples, for by means of it the
   Divinity of Christ was more fully made known to them, and they likewise
   perceived that purity is no ordinary gift of the Holy Spirit.

   John 13:12-17

   12. After then he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
   sitting down again at table, [45] he saith to them, Know ye what I have
   done to you? 13. You call me Master and Lord; and you say well, for so
   I am. 14. If I then, who am the Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
   you ought also to wash one another's feet. 15. For I have given you an
   example, that, as I have done to you, you should do also. 16. Verily,
   verily, I tell you, the servant is not greater than his lord, nor the
   ambassador [46] greater than he who sent him. 17. If you know these
   things, happy are you if you do them.


   12. When then he had washed their feet. Christ at length explains what
   was his intention in washing the feet of his disciples; for what he had
   said about the spiritual washing was a sort of digression from his main
   design. Had it not been for the opposition made by Peter, Christ would
   not have spoken on that subject. Now, therefore, he discloses the
   reason of what he had done; namely, that he who is the Master and Lord
   of all gave an example to be followed by all the godly, that none might
   grudge to descend to do a service to his brethren and equals, however
   mean and low that service might be. For the reason why the love of the
   brethren is despised is, that every man thinks more highly of himself
   than he ought, and despises almost every other person. Nor did he
   intend merely to inculcate modesty, but likewise to lay down this rule
   of brotherly love, that they should serve one another; for there is no
   brotherly love where there is not a voluntary subjection in assisting a
   neighbor.

   Know you what I have done? We see that Christ, for a short time,
   concealed his intention from his disciples, but that, after having
   tried their obedience, he seasonably revealed to them that which it was
   not expedient for them previously to know. Nor does he now wait till
   they ask, but of his own accord anticipates them. The same thing will
   be experienced by us also, provided that we suffer ourselves to be
   guided by his hand, even through unknown ways.

   14. If then I, who am your Lord and Master. This is an argument from
   the greater to the less. Pride hinders us from maintaining that
   equality which ought to exist amongst us. But Christ, who is far
   exalted above all others, stoops down, that he may make the proud men
   ashamed, who, forgetting their station and rank, look upon themselves
   as not bound to hold intercourse with the brethren. For what does a
   mortal man imagine himself to be, when he refuses to bear the burdens
   of brethren, to accommodate himself to their customs, and, in short, to
   perform those offices by which the unity of the Church is maintained?
   In short, he means that the man who does not think of associating with
   weak brethren, on the condition of submitting mildly and gently even to
   offices which appear to be mean, claims more than he has a right to
   claim, and has too high an opinion of himself. [47]

   15. For I have given you an example. It deserves our attention that
   Christ says that he gave an example; for we are not at liberty to take
   all his actions, without reserve, as subjects of imitation. The Papists
   boast that, by Christ's example, they observe the forty days' fast, or
   Lent. But we ought first to see whether or not he intended to lay down
   his fast as an example that the disciples might conform to it as a
   rule. We read: nothing of this sort, and, therefore, the imitation of
   it is not less wicked than if they attempted to fly to heaven. Besides,
   when they ought to have followed Christ, they were not imitators, but
   apes. Every year they have a fashion of washing some people's feet, as
   if it were a farce which they were playing on the stage; [48] and so,
   when they have performed this idle and unmeaning ceremony, they think
   that they have fully discharged their duty, and reckon themselves at
   liberty to despise their brethren during the rest of the year. [49] But
   -- what is far worse [50] -- after having washed the feet of twelve
   men, they subject every member of Christ to cruel torture, and thus
   spit in Christ's face. This display of buffoonery, therefore, is
   nothing else than a shameful mockery of Christ. At all events, Christ
   does not here enjoin an annual ceremony, but bids us be ready,
   throughout our whole life, to wash the feet of our brethren and
   neighbors. [51]

   16. Verily, verily, I tell you. These are indeed proverbial sayings,
   which admit of a far more extensive application, but which ought to be
   accommodated to the case in hand. In my opinion, therefore, they are
   mistaken who suppose them to have a general acceptation, as if Christ
   were now exhorting his disciples to bear the cross; for it is more
   correct to say that he employed them to serve his purpose.

   17. If you know these things. He declares that they are happy, if they
   know and do these things; for knowledge is not entitled to be called
   true, unless it produce such an effect on believers as to lead them to
   conform themselves to their Head. On the contrary, it is a vain
   imagination, when we look upon Christ, and the things which belong to
   Christ, as separate from ourselves. We may infer from this that, until
   a man has learned to yield to his brethren, he does not know if Christ
   be the Master. Since there is no man who performs his duty to his
   brethren in all respects, and since there are many who are careless and
   sluggish in brotherly offices, this shows us that we are still at a
   great distance from the full light of faith.

   John 13:18-20

   18. I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the
   Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eateth bread with me hath lifted up
   his heel against me. 19. I tell you this now, before it happen, that
   when it shall have happened, you may believe that I am. [52] 20.
   Verily, verily, I tell you, if I send any one. he who receiveth him
   receiveth me; and he who receiveth me receiveth him who sent me.


   18. I speak not of you all. He again declares that there is one among
   the disciples who, in reality, is the very reverse of a disciple; and
   he does so, partly for the sake of Judas, in order to render him the
   more inexcusable, and partly for the sake of the others, That they may
   not be overpowered by the ruin of Judas. Not only does he encourage
   them still to persevere in their calling when Judas falls away; but as
   the happiness which he speaks of is not common to all, he exhorts them
   to desire it with so much the greater eagerness, and to adhere to it
   the more firmly.

   I know whom I have chosen. This very circumstance -- that they will
   persevere -- he ascribes to their election; for the virtue of men,
   being frail, would tremble at every breeze, and would be laid down by
   the feeblest stroke, if the Lord did not uphold it by his hand. But as
   he governs those whom he has elected, all the engines which Satan can
   employ will not prevent them from persevering to the end with unshaken
   firmness. And not only does he ascribe to election their perseverance,
   but likewise the commencement of their piety. Whence does it arise that
   one man, rather than another, devotes himself to the word of God? It
   is, because he was elected. Again, whence does it arise that this man
   makes progress, and continues to lead a good and holy life, but because
   the purpose of God is unchangeable, to complete the work which was
   begun by his hand? In short, this is the source of the distinction
   between the children of God and unbelievers, that the former are drawn
   to salvation by the Spirit of adoption, while the latter are hurried to
   destruction by their flesh, which is under no restraint. Otherwise
   Christ might have said, "know what kind of person each of you will be;"
   but that they may not claim anything for themselves, but, on the
   contrary, may acknowledge that, by the grace of God alone, and not by
   their own virtue, they differ from Judas, he places before them that
   election by free grace on which they are founded. Let us, therefore,
   learn that every part of our salvation depends on election.

   In another passage he includes Judas in the number of the elect.

   Have not I chosen (or, elected) you twelve,
   and one of you is a devil? (John 6:70.) [53]

   But in that passage the mode of expression, though different, is not
   opposite, for there the word denotes a temporal election, by which God
   appoints us to any particular work; in the same manner as Saul, who was
   elected to be a king, and yet was a reprobate. But here Christ speaks
   of the eternal election, by which we become the children of God, and by
   which God predestinated us to life before the creation of the world.
   And, indeed, the reprobate are sometime, endued by God with the gifts
   of the Spirit, to execute the office with which he invests them. Thus,
   in Saul, we perceive, for a time, the splendor of royal virtues, and
   thus Judas also was distinguished by eminent gifts, and such as were
   adapted to an apostle of Christ. But this is widely different from the
   sanctification of the Holy Spirit, which the Lord bestows on none but
   his own children; for he renews them in understanding and heart, that
   they may be holy and unblameable in his sight. Besides, that
   sanctification has a deep root in them, which cannot be removed;
   because the adoption of God is without repentance. Meanwhile, let us
   regard it as a settled point, that it results from the election of God,
   when, having embraced by faith the doctrine of Christ, we also follow
   it during our life; and that this is the only cause of our happiness,
   by which we are distinguished from the reprobate; for they, being
   destitute of the grace of the Spirit, miserably perish, while we have
   Christ for our guardian, who guides us by his hand, and upholds us by
   his power.

   Besides, Christ gives here a clear proof of his Divinity; first, when
   he declares that he does not judge after the manner of men; and,
   secondly, when he pronounces himself to be the Author of election. For
   when he says, I know, the knowledge, of which he speaks, belongs
   peculiarly to God; but the second proof -- contained in the words, whom
   I have chosen -- is far more powerful, for he testifies that they who
   were elected before the creation of the world were elected by himself.
   So remarkable a demonstration of his Divine power ought to affect us
   more deeply, than if the Scripture had called him God a hundred times.

   That the Scripture may be fulfilled. It might have been thought
   improper that one should have been elected to so honorable a rank, who
   yet did not possess true piety; for it might readily have been
   objected, Why did not Christ elect one whom he intended to admit into
   the number of the Apostles? or rather Why did he appoint a man to be an
   Apostle, who, he well knew, would become so wicked? He explains that
   this must have happened, because it was foretold; or at least, that it
   was no new occurrence, for David had experienced the same thing. For
   some think that it is a prediction quoted, which properly applies to
   Christ; while others think that it is merely a comparison, that, as
   David was basely betrayed by a private enemy, so a similar condition
   awaits the children of God. According to the latter, the meaning would
   be: That one of my disciples wickedly betrays his Master, is not the
   first instance of treachery that has taken place in the world; but, on
   the contrary, we now experience what Scripture declares to have
   happened in ancient times." But, as in David there was shadowed out
   what was afterwards to be seen more fully in Christ, I readily agree
   with the former expositors, who think that this was strictly the
   fulfillment of that which David, by the Spirit of prophecy, had
   foretold, (Psalm 41:9.) Besides, some are of opinion that the clause
   under consideration does not contain a complete sense, and needs to
   have the principal verb supplied. But if we read it continuously, That
   the Scripture may be fulfilled, he who eateth bread with me lifteth up
   his heel against me, there will be nothing wanting.

   To lift up the heel is a metaphorical expression, and means, to attack
   a person in an unperceived manner, under the pretense of friendship, so
   as to gain an advantage over him, when he is not on his guard. Now what
   Christ suffered, who is our Head and our Pattern, we, who are his
   members, ought to endure patiently. And, indeed, it has usually
   happened in the Church in almost every age, that it has had no enemies
   more inveterate than the members of the Church; and, therefore, that
   believers may not have their minds disturbed by such atrocious
   wickedness, let them accustom themselves early to endure the attacks of
   traitors.

   19. I tell you this now, before it happen. By this statement he reminds
   his disciples that, when one of their number becomes a reprobate, this
   is so far from being a good reason for their being discouraged, that it
   ought to be a more full confirmation of their faith. For if we did not
   see before our eyes, in the Church, what has been foretold about her
   distresses and struggles, a doubt might justly arise in our minds,
   Where are the prophecies? But when the truth of Scripture agrees with
   our daily experience,^17 then do we perceive more clearly, that God
   takes care of us, and that we are governed by his providence.

   That you may believe that I am. [54] By the phrase, that I am, he means
   that he is that Messiah who had been promised; not that the conduct of
   Judas, as a traitor, was the first event that led the disciples to the
   exercise of faith, but because their faith made greater progress, when
   they arrived at the experience of those things which they had formerly
   heard from the mouth of Christ. Now this may be explained in two ways;
   either that Christ says that they will believe after the event has
   happened, because there was nothing which was hidden from him, or that
   nothing will be wanting in him of all that the Scripture testifies
   concerning Christ. As the two interpretations agree well enough
   together, I leave my readers at liberty to choose which of them they
   will prefer.

   20. Verily, verily, I tell you. In these words either the Evangelist
   relates a discourse on a different subject, and in a broken and
   imperfect state, or, Christ intended to meet the offense which was
   likely to arise from the crime of Judas; for the Evangelists do not
   always exhibit the discourses of Christ in unbroken succession, but
   sometimes throw together, in heaps, a variety of statements. It is more
   probable, however, that Christ intended to provide against this
   scandal. There is too good evidence that we are very ready to be
   wounded by bad examples; for, in consequence of this, the revolt of one
   man inflicts a deadly wound on two hundred others, while the steadiness
   of ten or twenty pious men hardly edifies a single individual. On this
   account, while Christ was placing such a monster before the eyes of his
   disciples, it was also necessary that he should stretch out his hand to
   them, lest, struck by the novelty, they should fall back. Nor was it
   only on their account that he said this, but he also consulted the
   advantage of those who should come after; for, otherwise, the
   remembrance of Judas might, even at the present day, do us grievous
   injury. When the devil cannot estrange us from Christ by hatred of his
   doctrine, he excites either dislike or contempt of the ministers
   themselves.

   Now this admonition of Christ shows that it is unreasonable that the
   impiety of any whose conduct is wicked or unbecoming their office,
   should at all diminish the apostolical authority. The reason is, we
   ought to contemplate God, the Author of the ministry, in whom,
   certainly, we find nothing which we have a right to despise; and next,
   we ought to contemplate Christ, who, having been appointed by the
   Father to be the only Teacher, speaks by his apostles. Whoever, then,
   does not deign to receive the ministers of the Gospel, rejects Christ
   in them, and rejects God in Christ.

   The Papists act a foolish and ridiculous part, when they endeavor to
   obtain this applause for themselves, in order exhibit their tyranny.
   For, in the first place, they adorn themselves with begged and borrowed
   feathers, having no resemblance to the apostles of Christ; and,
   secondly, granting that they are apostles, nothing was farther from
   Christ's intention, in this passage, than to transfer his own right to
   men; for what else is it to receive those whom Christ sends, but to
   give place to them, that they may fulfill the office which has been
   committed to them?

   John 13:21-29

   21. When Jesus had said these words, he was troubled in spirit, and
   testified, and said, Verily, verily, I tell you, that one of you will
   betray me. 22. The disciples, therefore, looked on one another,
   doubting of whom he spoke. 23. And one of the disciples, whom Jesus
   loved, was lying at table in Jesus' bosom. 24. Therefore Simon Peter
   made a sign to him, to ask who it was of whom he spoke. 25. Lying on
   the breast of Jesus.,., therefore, he saith to him, Lord, who is he?
   26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the dipped sop; and
   when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of
   Simon. 27. And after the sop, Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus
   to him, What thou doest, do quickly. 28. And no one of those who were
   at table knew why he said this to him. 29. For some thought, because
   Judas had the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy the things which we
   need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.


   21. When Jesus had said these words. The more sacred the apostolic
   office is, and the higher its dignity, the more base and detestable was
   the treachery of Judas. A crime so monstrous and detestable struck
   Christ himself with horror, when he saw how the incredible wickedness
   of one man had polluted that sacred order in which the majesty of God
   ought to have shone with brightness. To the same purpose is what the
   Evangelist adds, that he testified. His meaning is, the action was so
   monstrous that the bare mention of it could not be immediately
   believed.

   He was troubled in spirit. The Evangelist says that Christ was troubled
   in spirit, in order to inform us that he did not merely, in countenance
   and language, assume the appearance of a man who was troubled, but that
   he was deeply moved in his mind. Spirit here denotes the understanding,
   or, the soul; for I do not assent to the opinion of some who explain
   it, as if Christ had been driven by a violent impulse of the Holy
   Spirit to break out into these words. I readily acknowledge. that all
   the affections of Christ were guided by the Holy Spirit; but the
   meaning of the Evangelist is different, namely, that this suffering of
   Christ was inward, and was not feigned; and it is of great importance
   for us to know this, because his zeal is held out for our imitation,
   that we may be moved with deep horror by those monsters which overturn
   the sacred order of God and of his Church.

   22. The disciples, therefore, looked on one another. They who are not
   conscious of any crime are rendered uneasy by what Christ has said:
   Judas alone is so stupid amidst his malice, that he remains unmoved.
   The authority of Christ was held in so great estimation by the
   disciples, that they were fully convinced that he said nothing without
   a good reason; but Satan had expelled from the heart of Judas all
   reverence, so that it was harder than a rock to reject every
   admonition. And though Christ appears to be somewhat unkind in
   inflicting this torture, for a time, on those who were innocent, yet as
   anxiety of this kind was profitable to them, Christ did them no injury.
   It is proper that, when the children of God have heard the sentence of
   the ungodly, they should themselves feel uneasiness, that they may sift
   themselves, and guard against hypocrisy; for this gives them an
   opportunity of examining themselves and their life.

   This passage shows that we ought sometimes to reprove the ungodly in
   such a manner as not instantly to point the finger to them, until God,
   by his own hand, drag them forth to the light. For it frequently
   happens that there are secret diseases in the Church, which we are not
   at liberty to disguise; and yet the wickedness of men is not so ripe as
   to be capable of being laid open. In such cases we ought to take this
   middle path.

   23. Whom Jesus loved. The peculiar love with which Christ loved John
   plainly testifies that, if we love some more than others, this is not
   always inconsistent with brotherly love; but all lies in this, that our
   love shall be directed towards God, and that every man, in proportion
   as he excels in the gifts of God, shall share in it the more largely.
   From this end Christ never turned aside in the smallest degree; but
   with us the case is widely different, for such is the vanity of our
   mind, that there are few who, in loving men, approach more nearly to
   God. And yet the love of men towards each other will never be properly
   regulated, unless it be directed to God.

   Lay at table in Jesus' bosom. What is here related by John might be
   regarded in the present day as indecorous; but such was, at that time,
   the manner of being placed at table; for they did not sit, as we do, at
   table, but, after having put off their shoes, lay half-stretched out,
   reclining on small cushions.

   26. To whom I shall give the dipped sop. It may be asked, what purpose
   did it serve to give a dipped sop, for discovering the traitor, when
   Christ might have openly pointed him out by name, if he wished to make
   him known? I answer, the sign was of such a nature, that it discovered
   Judas to one person only, and did not immediately bring him forward to
   the view of all. But it was advantageous that John should be witness of
   this fact, in order that he might afterwards reveal it to others at the
   proper time; and Christ intentionally delayed to make Judas publicly
   known, that, when hypocrites are concealed, we may more patiently bear,
   till they are dragged forth to the light. We see Judas sitting amongst
   the others, and yet condemned by the mouth of the Judge. In no respect
   better is the condition of those who hold a place among the children of
   God.

   27. Satan entered into him. As it is certain that it was only at the
   instigation of Satan that Judas formed the design of committing so
   heinous a crime, why is it now said, for the first time, that Satan
   entered into him, who had already held the throne in his heart? But as
   they who are more fully confirmed in the faith which they formerly
   possessed are often said to believe, and thus an increase of their
   faith is called faith, so now that Judas is utterly given up to Satan,
   so as to be hurried on, by vehement impetuosity, to every extremity of
   evil, Satan is said to have entered into him. For as the saints make
   gradual progress, and in proportion to the new gifts by which they are
   continually enlarged, they are said to be filled with the Holy Spirit;
   so, in proportion as wicked men provoke the anger of God against
   themselves by their ingratitude, The Lord deprives them of his Spirit,
   of all light of reason, and, indeed, of all human feeling, and delivers
   them unreservedly to Satan. This is a dreadful vengeance of God, when
   men are given up to a reprobate mind, (Romans 1:28,) so that they
   scarcely differ at all from the brutes, and -- what is worse -- fall
   into horrid crimes from which the brutes themselves would shrink. We
   ought, therefore, to walk diligently in the fear of the Lord, lest, if
   we overpower his goodness by our wickedness, he at length give us up to
   the rage of, Satan.

   By giving the sop, Christ did not give an opportunity to Satan, but
   rather Judas, having received the sop, gave himself up entirely to
   Satan. It was, indeed, the occasion, but not the cause. His heart,
   which was harder than iron, ought to have been softened by so great
   kindness showed to him by Christ; and now his desperate and incurable
   obstinacy deserves that God, by his just judgment, should harden his
   heart still more by Satan. Thus, when, by acts of kindness to enemies,
   we heap coals of fire on their heads, (Romans 12:20,) if they are
   utterly incurable, they are the more enraged and inflamed [55] to their
   destruction. And yet no blame is due, on this account, to our kindness,
   by which their hearts ought to have been inflamed to love us.

   Augustine was wrong in thinking that this sop was an emblem of the body
   of Christ, since it was not during the Lord's Supper that it was given
   to Judas. It is also a very foolish dream to imagine that the devil
   entered essentially -- as the phrase is -- into Judas; for the
   Evangelist speaks only of the power and efficacy of Satan. This example
   reminds us what a dreadful punishment awaits all those who profane the
   gifts of the Lord by abusing them.

   What thou doest, do quickly. The exhortation addressed by Christ to
   Judas is not of such a nature that he can be regarded as exciting him
   to do the action: it is rather the language of one who views the crime
   with horror and detestation. [56] Hitherto he had endeavored, by
   various methods, to bring him back, but to no purpose. Now he addresses
   him as a desperate man, "Go to destruction, since you have resolved to
   go to destruction;" and, in doing so, he performs the office of a,
   judge, who condemns to death not those whom he, of his own accord,
   desires to ruin, but those who have already ruined themselves by their
   own fault. In short, Christ does not lay Judas under the necessity of
   perishing, but declares him to be what he had formerly been.

   28. Not one of those who were at table. Either John had not yet related
   to others what Christ had told him, or they were so much struck by it,
   that they lost their presence of mind; and, indeed, it is probable,
   that John himself was almost out of his senses. But what then happened
   to the disciples, we frequently see: taking place in the Church, that
   few of the believers discern the hypocrites whom the Lord loudly
   condemns.

   29. Or that he should give something to the poor. It is plain enough
   from other passages how great was Christ's poverty, and yet, out of the
   little that he had, he gave something to the poor, in order to lay down
   a rule for us; for the Apostles would not have conjectured that he had
   spoken about the poor, if it had not been their usual custom to relieve
   the poor

   John 13:30-35

   30. When, therefore, he had received the sop, he went immediately out;
   and it was night. 31. When, therefore, he was gone out, Jesus said, Now
   is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32. If God is
   glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will
   immediately glorify him. 33. Little children, but a little while am I
   yet with you. You shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, that
   whither I go, you cannot come, so now I say to you. 34. A new
   commandment I give you, That you love one another; as I have loved you,
   that you also love one another. 35. By this will all men know that you
   are my disciples, if you have love one to another.


   31. Now is the Son of man glorified. The last hour was at hand; Christ
   knew that the minds of his disciples were very weak, and, therefore, he
   endeavored, by every possible method, to support them, that they might
   not give way. Even at the present day, the remembrance of the cross of
   Christ is sufficient to make us tremble, were we not instantly met by
   the consolation, that he triumphed in the cross, having obtained a
   victory over Satan, sin, and death. What, then, might have happened to
   the Apostles, when they saw the Lord soon dragged to the cross, loaded
   with every kind of reproaches? Might not an exhibition so melancholy
   and revolting have overwhelmed them a hundred times? Christ, therefore,
   provides against this danger, and withdraws them from the outward
   aspect of death to its spiritual fruit. Whatever ignominy, then, may be
   seen in the cross, fitted to confound believers, yet Christ testifies
   that the same cross brings glory and honor to him. [57]

   And God is glorified in him. This clause, which immediately follows the
   other, is added for confirmation; for it was a paradoxical statement,
   that the glory of the Son of man arose from a death which was reckoned
   ignominious among men, and was even accursed before God. He shows,
   therefore, in what manner he would obtain glory to himself from such a
   death. It is, because by it [58] he glorifies God the Father; for in
   the cross of Christ:, as in a magnificent theater, the inestimable
   goodness of God is displayed before the whole world. In all the
   creatures, indeed, both high and low, the glory of God shines, but
   nowhere has it shone more brightly than in the cross, in which there
   has been an astonishing change of things, the condemnation of all men
   has been manifested, sin has been blotted out, salvation has been
   restored to men; and, in short, the whole world has been renewed, and
   every thing restored to good order.

   In him. Though the preposition (en) in is often used instead of the
   Hebrew v, and, in such eases, is equivalent to by, yet I have preferred
   translating it simply, that God is glorified in the Son of man; because
   I considered that phrase to be more emphatic. When he says, and God is
   glorified, the meaning, I apprehend, is, for God is glorified

   32. If God be glorified. Christ concludes that he will obtain a
   glorious triumph by his death; because his sole design in it is, to
   glorify his Father; for the Father did not seek his glory from the
   death of his Son in such a manner as not to make the Son a partaker of
   that glory. He promises, therefore, that when the ignominy which he
   shall endure for a short time has been effaced, illustrious honor will
   be displayed in his death. And this too was accomplished; for the death
   of the cross, which Christ suffered, is so far from obscuring his high
   rank, that in that death his high rank is chiefly displayed, since
   there his amazing love to mankind, his infinite righteousness in
   atoning for sin and appeasing the wrath of God, his wonderful power in
   conquering death, subduing Satan, and, at length, opening heaven,
   blazed with full brightness. This doctrine is now extended also to all
   of us; for though the whole world should conspire to cover us with
   infamy, yet if we sincerely and honestly endeavor to promote the glory
   of God, we ought not to doubt that God will also glorify us.

   And will immediately glorify him. Christ heightens the consolation by
   arguments drawn from the shortness of the time, when he promises that
   it will take place immediately. And though this glory began at the day
   of his resurrection, yet what is chiefly described here is the
   extension of it, which followed immediately afterwards, when, raising
   the dead by the power of the Gospel and of his Spirit, he created a new
   people for himself; for the honor which peculiarly belongs to the death
   of Christ, is the fruit which sprung from it for the salvation of men.

   33. Little children, yet a little while am I with you. As it was
   impossible that the disciples should not be deeply grieved at their
   Master's departure, so he gives them early warning that he will no
   longer be with them, and, at the same time, exhorts them to patience.
   Lastly, to remove unseasonable eagerness of desire, he declares that
   they cannot immediately follow him. In calling them little children, he
   shows, by that gentle appellation, that his reason for departing from
   them is not that he cares little about their welfare, for he loves them
   very tenderly. True, the object which he had in view in clothing
   himself with our flesh was, that he might be our brother, but by that
   other name he expresses more strongly the ardor of his love.

   As I said to the Jews. When he says, that he repeats to them what he
   had formerly said to the Jews, this is true as to the words, but there
   is a wide difference in the meaning; for he declares that they cannot
   follow him, in order that they may endure patiently his temporary
   absence, and -- so to speak -- bridles them in, that; they may remain
   in their office, till they have finished their warfare on earth; so
   that he does not perpetually exclude them, as Jews, from the kingdom of
   God, but only bids them wait patiently, till he bring them, along with
   himself, into the heavenly kingdom.

   34. A new commandment I give you. To the consolation he adds an
   exhortation, that they should love one another; as if he had said, "Yet
   while I am absent from you in body, testify, by mutual love, that I
   have not taught you in vain; let this be your constant study, your
   chief meditation." Why does he call it a new commandment? All are not
   agreed on this point. There are some who suppose the reason to be,
   that, while the injunction formerly contained in the Law about
   brotherly love was literal and external, Christ wrote it anew by his
   Spirit on the hearts of believers. Thus, according to them, the Law is
   new, because he publishes it in a new manner, that it may have full
   vigor. But that is, in my opinion, far-fetched, and at variance with
   Christ's meaning. The exposition given by others is, that, though the
   Law directs us to the exercise of love, still, because in it the
   doctrine of brotherly love is encumbered by many ceremonies and
   appendages, it is not so clearly exhibited; but, on the other hand,
   that perfection in love is laid down in the Gospel without any shadows.
   For my own part, though I do not absolutely reject this interpretation,
   I consider what Christ said to be more simple; for we know that laws
   are more carefully observed at the commencement, but they gradually
   slip out of the remembrance of men, till at length they become
   obsolete. In order to impress more deeply, therefore, on the minds of
   his disciples the doctrine of brotherly love, Christ recommends it on
   the ground of novelty; as if he had said, "I wish you continually to
   remember this commandment, as if it had been a law but lately made."

   In short, we see that it was the design of Christ, in this passage, to
   exhort his disciples to brotherly love, that they might never permit
   themselves to be withdrawn from the pursuit of it, or the doctrine of
   it to slip out of their minds. And how necessary this admonition was,
   we learn by daily experience; for, since it is difficult to maintain
   brotherly love, men lay it aside, and contrive, for themselves, new
   methods of worshipping God, and Satan suggests many things for the
   purpose of occupying their attention. Thus, by idle employments, they
   in vain attempt to mock God, but they deceive themselves. Let this
   title of novelty, therefore, excite us to the continual exercise of
   brotherly love. Meanwhile, let us know that it is called new, not
   because it now began, for the first time, to please God, since it is
   elsewhere called the fulfilling of the law, (Romans 13:10.)

   That you love one another. Brotherly love is, indeed, extended to
   strangers, for we are all of the same flesh, and are all created after
   the image of God; but because the image of God shines more brightly in
   those who have been regenerated, it is proper that the bond of love,
   among the disciples of Christ, should be far more close. In God
   brotherly love seeks its cause, from him it has its root, and to him it
   is directed. Thus, in proportion as it perceives any man to be a child
   of God, it embraces him with the greater warmth and affection. Besides,
   the mutual exercise of love cannot exist but in those who are guided by
   the same Spirit. It is the highest degree of brotherly love, therefore,
   that is here described by Christ; but we ought to believe, on the other
   hand, that, as the goodness of God extends to the whole world, so we
   ought to love all, even those who hate us.

   As I have loved you. He holds out his own example, not because we can
   reach it, for we are at a vast distance behind him, but that we may, at
   least, aim at the same end.

   35. By this all men will know. Christ again confirms what he had
   formerly said, that they who mutually love one another have not been in
   vain taught in his school; as if he had said, Not only will you know
   that you are my disciples, but your profession will also be
   acknowledged by others to be sincere." Since Christ lays down this mark
   for distinguishing between his disciples and strangers, they who lay
   aside brotherly love, and adopt new and invented modes of worship,
   labor in vain; and folly of this kind prevails at this day in Popery.
   Nor is it superfluous that Christ dwells so largely on this subject.
   There is no greater agreement between the love of ourselves, and the
   love of our neighbor, than there is between fire and water. Self love
   keeps all our senses bound in such a manner that brotherly love is
   altogether banished; and yet we think that we fully discharge our duty,
   because Satan has many enticements to deceive us, that we may not
   perceive our faults. [59] Whoever, then, desires to be truly a disciple
   of Christ, and to be acknowledged by God, let him form and direct his
   whole life to love the brethren, and let him pursue this object with
   diligence.

   John 13:36-38

   36. Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered
   him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow
   me afterwards. 37. Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee
   now? I, will lay down my life for thee. 38. Jesus answered him, Wilt
   thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I tell thee, The cock
   will not crow until thou hast denied me thrice.


   36. Lord, whither goest thou? This question is founded on that saying
   of Christ,

   I said to the Jews, that whither I go you cannot come, so now I say to
   you,
   (John 13:33.)

   From this it is evident how ignorant Peter was, who, after having been
   so frequently warned about Christ's departure, was as greatly perplexed
   as if he had heard something new. Yet in this respect we are too like
   him; for we hear daily from the mouth of Christ all that is fitted for
   usefulness in life, and all that is necessary to be known, and, when we
   come to practice, we are as much astonished as apprentices to whom not
   a word had ever been spoken. Besides, Peter shows that he is under the
   influence of an immoderate desire of Christ's bodily presence; for he
   reckons it absurd that, while he remains, Christ shall go elsewhere.

   Whither I go. By these words Christ restrains Peter's excessive desire.
   His language is concise, as becomes a Master, but immediately softens
   the hardness of his statement. He shows that it will only be for a time
   that he shall be separated from his disciples. We are taught by this
   passage to subject all our desires to God, that they may not go beyond
   their proper bounds; and if at any time they become extravagant and
   foolish, let us at least submit to be held in by this bridle. That we
   may not lose courage, let us avail ourselves of the consolation which
   is immediately added, when Christ promises that we shall one day be
   gathered to him.

   But thou shalt follow me afterwards. He means that Peter is not yet
   ripe for bearing the cross, but, like corn still in the blade, must be
   formed and strengthened by the progress of time, that he may follow. We
   ought therefore to pray to God to carry forward to a higher degree of
   excellence what he has begun in us. In the meantime, we must creep,
   till we are able to run more swiftly. Now as Christ bears with us,
   while we are tender and delicate, so let us learn not to reject weak
   brethren, who are still very far from the goal. It is desirable,
   indeed, that all should run with the greatest eagerness, and we ought
   to encourage all to quicken their pace; but if there are any who walk
   more slowly, we ought to hope well concerning them, provided that they
   keep the road.

   37. Why cannot I follow thee now? By these words Peter declares that he
   was dissatisfied with Christ's answer. He is aware that he has been
   warned of his own weakness, from which he concludes that it is his own
   fault that hinders him from following Christ immediately; but he is not
   at all convinced of it, for mankind are naturally puffed up with
   confidence in their own value. This expression of Peter shows the
   opinion which we entertain from our very birth, which is, that we
   attribute more to our own strength than we ought to do. The consequence
   is, that they who can do nothing venture to attempt every thing,
   without imploring the assistance of God.

   38. Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Christ did not choose to debate
   with Peter, but wished that he should grow wise by his own experience,
   like fools, who never grow wise till they have received a stroke. Peter
   promises unshaken firmness, and indeed expresses the sincere conviction
   of his mind; but his confidence is full of rashness, for he does not
   consider what strength has been given to him. Now since this example
   belongs to us, let each of us examine his own defects, that he may not
   be swelled with vain confidence. We cannot indeed make too large
   promises about the grace of God; but what is here reproved is the
   arrogant presumption of the flesh, for faith rather produces fear and
   anxiety.

   The cock will not crow. As presumption and rashness proceed from
   ignorance of ourselves, Peter is blamed for pretending to be a valiant
   soldier while he is beyond arrow-shot; for he has not yet made trial of
   his strength, and imagines that he could do any thing. He was
   afterwards punished, as he deserved, for his arrogance. Let us learn to
   distrust our own strength, and to betake ourselves early to the Lord,
   that he may support us by his power.

   CHAPTER 14
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 14:1-7

   1. Let not your heart be troubled -- you believe in God, believe also
   in me. 2. In my Father's house are many dwellings, and if it were not
   so, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you. 3. And if I
   go away and prepare a place for you, [60] I will return again, and
   receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be also. 4. And whither
   I go you know, and you know the way. 5. Thomas saith to him, Lord, we
   know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way? 6. Jesus
   saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh
   to the Father but by me. 7. If you had known me, you would have known
   my Father also; and henceforth you know him, and have seen him.


   1. Let not your heart be troubled. Not without good reason does Christ
   confirm his disciples by so many words, since a contest so arduous and
   so terrible awaited them; for it was no ordinary temptation, that soon
   afterwards they would see him hanging on the cross; a spectacle in
   which nothing was to be seen but ground for the lowest despair. The
   season of so great distress being at hand, he points out the remedy,
   that they may not be vanquished and overwhelmed; for he does not simply
   exhort and encourage them to be steadfast, but likewise informs them
   where they must go to obtain courage; that is, by faith, when he is
   acknowledged to be the Son of God, who has in himself a sufficiency of
   strength for maintaining the safety of his followers.

   We ought always to attend to the time when these words were spoken,
   that Christ wished his disciples to remain brave and courageous, when
   they might think that every thing was in the greatest confusion; and
   therefore we ought to employ the same shield for warding off such
   assaults. It is impossible for us, indeed, to avoid feeling various
   emotions, but though we are shaken, we must not fall down. Thus it is
   said of believers, that they are not troubled, because, relying on the
   word of God, though very great difficulties press hard upon them, still
   they remain steadfast and upright.

   You believe in God. It might also be read in the imperative mood,
   Believe in God, and believe in me; but the former reading agrees
   better, and has been more generally received. Here he points out the
   method of remaining steadfast, as I have already said; that is, if our
   faith rest on Christ, and view him in no other light than as being
   present and stretching out his hand to assist us. But it is wonderful
   that faith in the Father is here placed first in order, for he ought
   rather to have told his disciples that they ought to believe in God,
   since they had believed in Christ; because, as Christ is the lively
   image of the Father, so we ought first to cast our eyes on him; and for
   this reason, too, he descends to us, that our faith, beginning with
   him, may rise to God. But Christ had a different object in view, for
   all acknowledge that we ought to believe in God, and this is an
   admitted principle to which all assent without contradiction; and yet
   there is scarce one in a hundred who actually believes it, not only
   because the naked majesty of God is at too great a distance from us,
   but also because Satan interposes clouds of every description to hinder
   us from contemplating God. The consequence is, that our faith, seeking
   God in his heavenly glory and inaccessible light, vanishes away; and
   even the flesh, of its own accord, suggests a thousand imaginations, to
   turn away our eyes from beholding God in a proper manner.

   The Son of God, then, who is Jesus Christ, [61] holds out himself as
   the object to which our faith ought to be directed, and by means of
   which it will easily find that on which it can rest; for he is the true
   Immanuel, who answers us within, as soon as we seek him by faith. It is
   one of the leading articles of our faith, that our faith ought to be
   directed to Christ alone, that it may not wander through long windings;
   and that it ought to be fixed on him, that it may not waver in the
   midst of temptations. And this is the true proof of faith, when we
   never suffer ourselves to be torn away from Christ, and from the
   promises which have been made to us in him. When Popish divines
   dispute, or, I should rather say, chatter, about the object of faith,
   they mention God only, and pay no attention to Christ. They who derive
   their instruction from the notions of such men, must be shaken by the
   slightest gale of wind that blows. Proud men are ashamed of Christ's
   humiliation, and, therefore, they fly to God's incomprehensible
   Divinity. But faith will never reach heaven unless it submit to Christ,
   who appears to be a low and contemptible God, and will never be firm if
   it do not seek a foundation in the weakness of Christ.

   2. In my Father's house are many dwellings. As the absence of Christ
   was a cause of grief, he declares that he does not, go away in such a.
   manner as to remain separate from them, since there is room for them
   also in the heavenly kingdom. For it was proper that he should remove
   the suspicion from their minds, that, when Christ ascended to the
   Father, he left his disciples on earth without taking any farther
   notice of them. This passage has been erroneously interpreted in
   another sense, as if Christ taught that' there are various degrees of
   honor in the heavenly kingdom; for he says, that the mansions are many,
   not that they are different or unlike, but that there are enough of
   them for a great number of persons; as if he had said, that there is
   room not only for himself, but also for all his disciples.

   And if it were not so, I would have told you. Here commentators differ.
   Some read these words as closely connected with what goes before: "If
   the dwellings had not been already prepared, I would have said that I
   go before you to prepare them." But I rather agree with those who
   render it thus: "If the heavenly glory had awaited me only, I would not
   have deceived you. I would have told you that there was no room for any
   one but myself in my Father's house. But the case is widely different;
   for I go before, to prepare a place for you." The context, in my
   opinion, demands that we read it in this manner; for it follows
   immediately afterwards, If I go to prepare a place for you. By these
   words Christ intimates that the design of his departure is, to prepare
   a place for his disciples. In a word, Christ did not ascend to heaven
   in a private capacity, to dwell there alone, but rather that it might
   be the common inheritance of all the godly, and that in this way the
   Head might be united to his members.

   But a question arises, What was the condition of the fathers after
   death, before Christ ascended to heaven? For the conclusion usually
   drawn is, that believing souls were shut up in an intermediate state or
   prison, because Christ says that, by his ascension into heaven, the
   place will be prepared. But the answer is easy. This place is said to
   be prepared for the day of the resurrection; for by nature mankind are
   banished from the kingdom of God, but the Son, who is the only heir of
   heaven, took possession of it in their name, that through him we may be
   permitted to enter; for in his person we already possess heaven by
   hope, as Paul informs us, (Ephesians 1:3.) Still we will not enjoy this
   great blessing, until he come from heaven the second time. The
   condition of the fathers after death, therefore, is not here
   distinguished from ours; because Christ has prepared both for them and
   for us a place, into which he will receive us all at the last day.
   Before reconciliation had been made, believing souls were, as it were,
   placed on a watch-tower, looking for the promised redemption, and now
   they enjoy a blessed rest, until the redemption be finished.

   3. And if I go away. The conditional term, if, ought to be interpreted
   as an adverb of time; as if it had been said, "After that I have gone
   away, I will return to you again." This return must not be understood
   as referring to the Holy Spirit, as if Christ had manifested to the
   disciples some new presence of himself by the Spirit. It is
   unquestionably true, that Christ dwells with us and in us by his
   Spirit; but here he speaks of the last day of judgment, when he will,
   at length, come to assemble his followers. And, indeed, if we consider
   the whole body of the Church, he every day prepares a place for us;
   whence it follows, that the proper time for our entrance into heaven is
   not yet come.

   4. And whither I go you know. As we need no ordinary fortitude, that we
   may patiently endure to be so long separated from Christ, he adds
   another confirmation, that the disciples know that his death is not a
   destruction, but a passage to the Father; and next, that they know the
   way which they must follow, that they may arrive at the participation
   of the same glory. Both clauses ought to be carefully observed. First,
   we must see Christ, by the eyes of faith, in the heavenly glory and a
   blessed immortality; and, secondly, we ought to know that he is the
   first-fruits of our life, and that the way which was closed against us
   has been opened by him.

   5. Thomas saith to him. Though, at first sight, the reply of Thomas
   appears to contradict what Christ had said, yet he did not intend to
   give the lie to his Master. But it may be asked, In what sense does he
   deny what Christ asserted? I reply, the knowledge possessed by the
   saints is sometimes confused, because they do not understand the manner
   or the reason of those things which are certain, and which have been
   explained to them. For example, the Prophets foretold the calling of
   the Gentiles with a true perception of faith, and yet Paul declares
   that it was a mystery hidden from them, (Ephesians 3:2, 4.) In like
   manner, when the Apostles believed that Christ was departing to the
   Father, and yet did not know in what way he would obtain the kingdom,
   Thomas justly replies, that they do not know whither he is going. Hence
   he concludes that they know still less about the way; for before we
   enter into a road, we must know where we intend to go.

   6. I am the way. Though Christ does not give a direct reply to the
   question put to him, yet he passes by nothing that is useful to be
   known. It was proper that Thomas' curiosity should be checked; and,
   therefore, Christ does not explain what would be his condition when he
   should have departed out of this world to go to the Father, [62] but
   dwells on a subject far more necessary. Thomas would gladly have heard
   what Christ intended to do in heaven, as we never become weary of those
   intricate speculations; but it is of greater importance to us to employ
   our study and labor in another inquiry, how we may become partakers of
   the blessed resurrection. The statement amounts to this, that whoever
   obtains Christ is ill want of nothing; and, therefore, that whoever is
   not satisfied with Christ alone, strives after something beyond
   absolute perfection.

   The way, the truth, and the life. He lays down three degrees, as if he
   had said, that he is the beginning, and the middle, and the end; and
   hence it follows that we ought to begin with him, to continue in him,
   and to end in him. We certainly ought not to seek for higher wisdom
   than that which leads us to eternal life, and he testifies that this
   life is to be found in him. Now the method of obtaining life is, to
   become new creatures. He declares, that we ought not to seek it
   anywhere else, and, at the same time, reminds us, that he is the way,
   by which alone we can arrive at it. That he may not fail us in any
   respect, he stretches out the hand to those who are going astray, and
   stoops so low as to guide sucking infants. Presenting himself as a
   leader, he does not leave his people in the middle of the course, but
   makes them partakers of the truth. At length he makes them enjoy the
   fruit of it, which is the most excellent and delightful thing that can
   be imagined.

   As Christ is the way, the weak and ignorant have no reason to complain
   that they are forsaken by him; and as he is the truth and the life, he
   has in himself also what is fitted to satisfy the most perfect. In
   short, Christ now affirms, concerning happiness, what I have lately
   said concerning the object of faith. All believe and acknowledge that
   the happiness of man lies in God alone: but they afterwards go wrong in
   this respect, that, seeking God elsewhere than in Christ, they tear him
   -- so to speak -- from his true and solid Dignity.

   The truth is supposed by some to denote here the saving light of
   heavenly wisdom, and by others to denote the substance of life and of
   all spiritual blessings, which is contrasted with shadows and figures;
   as it is said, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, (John 1:17.) My
   opinion is, that the truth means here the perfection of faith as the
   way means its beginning and first elements. The whole may be summed up
   thus: "If any man turn aside from Christ, he will do nothing but go
   astray; if any man do not rest on him, he will feed elsewhere on
   nothing but wind and vanity; if any man, not satisfied with him alone,
   wishes to go farther, [63] he will find death instead of life."

   No man cometh to the Father. This is an explanation of the former
   statement', for he is the way, because he leads us to the Father, and
   he is the truth and the life, because in him we perceive the Father. As
   to calling on God, it may indeed be said, with truth, that no prayers
   are heard but through the intercession of Christ; but as Christ does
   not now speak about prayer, we ought simply to understand the meaning
   to be, that men contrive for themselves true labyrinths, whenever,
   after having forsaken Christ, they attempt to come to God. For Christ
   proves that he is the life, because God, with whom is the fountain of
   life, (Psalm 36:9,) cannot be enjoyed in any other way than in Christ.
   Wherefore all theology, when separated from Christ, is not only vain
   and confused, but is also mad, deceitful, and spurious; for, though the
   philosophers sometimes utter excellent sayings, yet they have nothing
   but what is short-lived, and even mixed up with wicked and erroneous
   sentiments.

   7. If you had known me. He confirms what we have just now said, that it
   is a foolish and pernicious curiosity, when men, not satisfied with
   him, attempt to go to God by indirect and crooked paths. [64] They
   admit that there is nothing better than the knowledge of God; but when
   he is near them, and speaks to them familiarly, they wander through
   their own speculations, and seek above the clouds him whom they do not
   deign to acknowledge as present. Christ, therefore, blames the
   disciples for not acknowledging that the fullness of the Godhead was
   manifested in him. "I see," (says he,) "that hitherto you have not
   known me in a right and proper manner, because you do not yet
   acknowledge the lively image of the Father which is exhibited in me."

   And henceforth you know him, and have seen him. He adds this, not only
   to soften the severity of the reproof, but likewise to accuse them of
   ingratitude and slothfulness, if they do not consider and inquire what
   has been given to them; for he said this rather for the purpose of
   commending his doctrine than of extolling their faith. The meaning
   therefore is, that God is now plainly exhibited to them if they would
   but open their eyes. The word see expresses the certainty of faith.

   John 14:8-14

   8. Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
   9. Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou
   not known me, Philip? He who hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how
   sayest thou, Show us the Father? 10. Believest thou not that I am in
   the Father, and the Father in me? The words which I speak to you I
   speak not from myself; but my Father who dwelleth in me, he doeth the
   works. 11. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me;
   but if not, believe me on account of the works themselves. 12. Verily,
   verily, I tell you, He who believeth in me shall himself also do the
   works which I do, and shall do greater works than these, because I go
   to my Father. 13. And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that
   the Father may be, glorified in the Son. 14. If you shall ask any thing
   in my name, I will do it.


   8. Show us the Father. It appears to be very absurd that the Apostles
   should offer so many objections to the Lord; for why did he speak but
   to inform them on that point about which Philip puts the question? Yet
   there is not one of their faults that is here described that may not be
   charged on us as well as on them. We profess to be earnest in seeking
   God; and when he presents himself before our eyes, we are blind.

   9. Have I been so long time with you? Christ justly reproves Philip for
   not having the eyes of his faith pure. He had God present in Christ,
   and yet he did not behold him. What prevented him but his own
   ingratitude? Thus, in the present day, they who, in consequence of not
   being satisfied with Christ alone, are hurried into foolish
   speculations, in order to seek God in them, make little progress in the
   Gospel. This foolish desire springs from the meanness of Christ's low
   condition; and this is very unreasonable, for by that humiliation he
   exhibits the infinite goodness of God.

   10. That I am in the Father, and the Father in me. I do not consider
   these words to refer to Christ's Divine essence, but to the manner of
   the revelation; for Christ, so far as regards his hidden Divinity, is
   not better known to us than the Father. But he is said to be the lively
   Image, or Portrait, of God, [65] because in him God has fully revealed
   himself, so far as God's infinite goodness, wisdom, and power, are
   clearly manifested in him. And yet the ancient writers do not take an
   erroneous view of this passage, when they quote it as a proof for
   defending Christ's Divinity; but as Christ does not simply inquire what
   he is in himself, but what we ought to acknowledge him to be, this
   description applies to his power rather than to his essence. The
   Father, therefore, is said to be in Christ, because full Divinity
   dwells in him, and displays its power; and Christ, on the other hand,
   is said to be in the Father, because by his Divine power he shows that
   he is one with the Father

   The words which I speak to you. He proves from the effect that we ought
   not to seek God anywhere else than in him; for he maintains that his
   doctrine, being heavenly and truly Divine, is a proof and bright mirror
   of the presence of God. If it be objected, that all the Prophets ought
   to be accounted sons of God, because they speak divinely from the
   inspiration of the Spirit, and because God was the Author of their
   doctrine, the answer is easy. We ought to consider what their doctrine
   contains; for the Prophets send their disciples to another person, but
   Christ attaches them to himself. Besides, we ought to remember what the
   apostle declares, that now God speaketh from heaven (Hebrews 12:25) by
   the mouth of his Son, and that, when he spoke by Moses, he spoke, as it
   were, from the earth.

   I do not speak, from myself; that is, as a man only, or after the
   manner of men; because the Father, exhibiting the power of his Spirit
   in Christ's doctrine, wishes his Divinity to be recognized in him.

   This must not be confined to miracles; for it is rather a continuation
   of the former statement, that the majesty of God is clearly exhibited
   in Christ's doctrine; as if he had said, that his doctrine is truly a
   work of God, from which it may be known with certainty that God
   dwelleth in him. By the works, therefore, I understand a proof of the
   power of God.

   Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. He first
   demands from the disciples to give credit to his testimony, when he
   asserts that he is the Son of God; but as they had hitherto been too
   lazy, he indirectly reproves their indolence. "If my assertion," says
   he, "does not produce conviction, and if you have so mean an opinion of
   me, that you do not think that you ought to believe my words, consider,
   at least, that power which is a visible image of the presence of God."
   It is very absurd in them, indeed, not to believe, entirely, the words
   which proceed from the mouth of the Lord Jesus, [66] since they ought
   to have embraced, without any hesitation, every thing that he
   expressed, even by a single word. But here Christ reproves his
   disciples for having made so little progress, though they had received
   so many admonitions on the same subject. He does not explain what is
   the nature of faith, but declares that he has what is even sufficient
   for convicting unbelievers.

   The repetition of the words, I am in the Father, and the Father in me,
   is not superfluous; for we know too well, by experience, how our nature
   prompts us to foolish curiosity. As soon as we have gone out of Christ,
   we shall have nothing else than the idols which we have formed, but in
   Christ, there is nothing but what is divine, and what keeps us in God

   12. Verily, verily, I, tell you. All that he had hitherto told his
   disciples about himself, so far as it regarded them, was temporal; and,
   therefore, if he had not added this clause, the consolation would not
   have been complete; particularly since our memory is so short, when we
   are called to consider the gifts of God. On this subject it is
   unnecessary to go to others for examples; for, when God has loaded us
   with every kind of blessings, if He pause for fourteen days, we fancy
   that he is no longer alive. This is the reason why Christ not only
   mentions his present power, which the Apostles, at that time, beheld
   with their eyes, but promises an uninterrupted conviction of it for the
   future. And, indeed, not only was his Divinity attested, so long as he
   dwelt on the earth, but after he had gone to the Father, striking
   proofs of it were enjoyed by believers. But either our stupidity or our
   malice hinders us from perceiving God in his works, and Christ in the
   works of God.

   And shall do greater works than these. Many are perplexed by the
   statement of Christ, that the Apostles would do greater works than he
   had done I pass by the other answers which have been usually given to
   it, and satisfy myself with this single answer. First, we must
   understand what Christ means; namely, that the power by which he proves
   himself to be the Son of God, is so far from being confined to his
   bodily presence, that it must be clearly demonstrated by many and
   striking proofs, when he is absent. Now the ascension of Christ was
   soon afterwards followed by a wonderful conversion of the world, in
   which the Divinity of Christ was more powerfully displayed than while
   he dwelt among men. Thus, we see that the proof of his Divinity was not
   confined to the person of Christ, but was diffused through the whole
   body of the Church.

   Because I go to the Father. This is the reason why the disciples would
   do greater things than Christ himself. It is because, when he has
   entered into the possession of his kingdom, he will more fully
   demonstrate his power from heaven. Hence it is evident that his glory
   is in no degree diminished, because, after his departure, the Apostles,
   who were only his instruments, performed more excellent works. What is
   more, in this manner it became evident that he sitteth at the right
   hand of the Father, that every knee may bow before him, (Philippians
   2:10.)

   13. And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do. By these words He
   plainly declares that he will be the Author of all that shall be done
   by the hands of the Apostles. But it may be asked, was he not even then
   the Mediator in whose name men ought to pray to the Father? I reply, he
   plainly discharged the office of Mediator, ever since he entered into
   the heavenly sanctuary; as we shall afterwards repeat at the proper
   place.

   That the Father may be glorified in the Son. This passage agrees with
   what Paul says,

   That every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory
   of God the Father, (Philippians 2:11.)

   The end of all things is the sanctification of the name of God; but
   here the true method of sanctifying it is declared; that is, in the
   Son, and by the Son. For, though the majesty of God be in itself hidden
   from us, it shines in Christ; though his hand be concealed, we have it
   visible in Christ. Consequently, in the benefits which the Father
   bestows upon us, we have no right to separate the Father from the Son,
   according to that saying,

   He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father,
   (John 6:23.)

   14. If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. This is not a
   useless repetition. All see and feel that they are unworthy to approach
   God; and yet the greater part of men burst forward, as if they were out
   of their senses, and rashly and haughtily address God; and afterwards,
   when that unworthiness, of which I have spoken, comes to their
   recollection, every man contrives for himself various expedients. On
   the other hand, when God invites us to himself, he holds out to us one
   Mediator only, by whom he is willing to be appeased and reconciled. But
   here again the wickedness of the human mind breaks out for the greater
   part do not cease to forsake the road, and to pass through many
   windings. The reason why they do so is, that they have but a poor and
   slender perception of the power and goodness of God in Christ. To this
   is added a second error, that we do not consider that we are justly
   excluded from approaching God, until he calls us, and that we are
   called only through the Son. And if one passage has not sufficient
   weight with us, let us know that, when Christ repeats, a second time,
   that we must pray to the Father in his name, he lays his hand on us, as
   it were, that we may not lose our pains by fruitlessly seeking other
   intercessors.

   John 14:15-18

   15. If you love me, keep my commandments. 16. And I will pray to the
   Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with
   you for ever; 17. The Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
   because it seeth him not, and knoweth him not; but you know him; for he
   dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 18. I will not leave you
   orphans; I come to you. [67]


   15. If you love me. The love with which the disciples loved Christ was
   true and sincere, and yet there was some superstition mixed with it, as
   is frequently the case with ourselves; for it was very foolish in them
   to wish to keep him in the world. To correct this fault, he bids them
   direct their love to another end; and that is, to employ themselves in
   keeping the commandments which he had given them. This is undoubtedly a
   useful doctrine, for of those who think that they love Christ, there
   are very few who honor him as they ought to do; but, on the contrary,
   after having performed small and trivial services, they give themselves
   no farther concern. The true love of Christ, on the other hand, is
   regulated by the observation of his doctrine as the only rule. But we
   are likewise reminded how sinful our affections are, since even the
   love which we bear to Christ is not without fault, if it be not
   directed to a pure obedience.

   16. And I will pray to the Father. This was given as a remedy for
   soothing the grief which they might feel on account of Christ's
   absence; but at the same time, Christ promises that he will give them
   strength to keep his commandments; For otherwise the exhortation would
   have had little effect. He therefore loses no time in informing them
   that, though he be absent from them in body, yet he will never allow
   them to remain destitute of assistance; for he will be present with
   them by his Spirit.

   Here he calls the Spirit the gift of the Father, but a gift which he
   will obtain by his prayers; in another passage he promises that he will
   give the Spirit. If I depart, says he, I will send, Him to you, (John
   16:7.) Both statements are true and correct; for in so far as Christ is
   our Mediator and Intercessor, he obtains from the Father the grace of
   the Spirit, but in so far as he is God, he bestows that grace from
   himself. The meaning of this passage therefore is: "I was given to you
   by the Father to be a Comforter, but only for a time; now, having
   discharged my office, I will pray to him to give another Comforter, who
   will not be for a short time, but will remain always with you."

   And he will, give you another Comforter. The word Comforter is here
   applied both to Christ and to the Spirit, and justly; for it is an
   office which belongs equally to both of them, to comfort and exhort us,
   and to guard us by their protection. Christ was the Protector of his
   disciples, so long as he dwelt in the world: and afterwards he
   committed them to the protection and guardianship of the Spirit. It may
   be asked, are we not still under the protection of Christ? The answer
   is easy. Christ is a continual Protector, but not in a visible way. So
   long as he dwelt in the world, he openly manifested himself as their
   Protector; but now he guards us by his Spirit.

   He calls the Spirit another Comforter, on account of the difference
   between the blessings which we obtain from both. The peculiar office of
   Christ was, to appease the wrath of God by atoning for the sins of the
   world, to redeem men from death, to procure righteousness and life; and
   the peculiar office of the Spirit is, to make us partakers not only of
   Christ himself, but of all his blessings. And yet there would be no
   impropriety in inferring from this passage a distinction of Persons;
   for there must be some peculiarity in which the Spirit differs from the
   Son so as to be another than the Son.

   17. The Spirit of truth. Christ bestows on the Spirit another title,
   namely, that he is the Master or Teacher of truth. [68] Hence it
   follows, that until we have been inwardly instructed by him, the
   understandings of all of us are seized with vanity and falsehood.

   Whom the world cannot receive. This contrast shows the peculiar
   excellence of that grace which God bestows on none but his elect; for
   he means that it is no ordinary gift of which the world is deprived. In
   this sense, too, Isaiah says, "For, the darkness shall cover the earth,
   and thick darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise on thee, O
   Jerusalem!" [69] For the mercy of God towards the Church deserves so
   much the higher praise, when he exalts the Church, by a distinguished
   privilege, above the whole world. And yet Christ exhorts the disciples,
   that they must not be puffed up, as the world is wont to be, by carnal
   views, and thus drive away from themselves the grace of the Spirit. All
   that Scripture tells us about the Holy Spirit is regarded by earthly
   men as a dream; because, trusting to their own reason, they despise
   heavenly illumination. Now, though this pride abounds everywhere, which
   extinguishes, so far as lies in our power, the light of the Holy
   Spirit; yet, conscious of our own poverty, we ought to know, that
   whatever belongs to sound understanding proceeds from no other source.
   Yet Christ's words show that nothing which relates to the Holy Spirit
   can be learned by human reason, but that He is known only by the
   experience of faith.

   The world, he says, cannot receive the Spirit, because it knoweth him
   not; but you know him, because he dwelleth with you. It is the Spirit
   alone therefore, who, by dwelling in us, makes himself to be known by
   us, for otherwise, he is unknown and incomprehensible.

   18. I will not have you orphans. This passage shows what men are, and
   what they can do, when they have been deprived of the protection of the
   Spirit. They are orphans, exposed to every kind of fraud and injustice,
   incapable of governing themselves, and, in short, unable of themselves
   to do any thing. The only remedy for so great a defect is, if Christ
   govern us by his Spirit, which he promises that he will do. First then,
   the disciples are reminded of their weakness, that, distrusting
   themselves, they may rely on nothing else than the protection of
   Christ; and, secondly, having promised a remedy, he gives them good
   encouragement; for he declares that he will never leave them When he
   says, I will come to you, he shows in what manner he dwells in his
   people, and in what manner he fills all things. It is, by the power of
   his Spirit; and hence it is evident, that the grace of the Spirit is a
   striking proof of his Divinity.

   John 14:19-20

   19. Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more; but you see
   me: because I live, you also shall live. 20. At that day you shall know
   that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.


   19. Yet a little while. He continues the commendation of special grace,
   which ought to have been sufficient for alleviating, and even for
   removing the grief of the disciples. "When I shall have withdrawn,"
   says he, "from the view of the world: still I shall be present with
   you." That we may enjoy this secret beholding of Christ, we must not
   judge of his presence or his absence according to carnal perception,
   but we must earnestly employ the eyes of faith for contemplating his
   power. Thus believers always have Christ present by his Spirit, and
   behold him, though they be distant from him in body.

   Because I live. This statement may be explained in two ways. Either it
   may be viewed as a confirmation of the former clause, because I live,
   and you shall live; or, it may be read separately, because I live, you
   also shall live; and then the meaning will be, that believers will
   live, because Christ liveth I willingly embrace the former opinion, and
   yet we may draw from it the other doctrine, that the life of Christ is
   the cause of our life. He begins by pointing out the cause of the
   difference, why he shall be seen by his disciples, and not by the world
   It isn't because Christ cannot be seen but according to the spiritual
   life, of which the world is deprived. The world seeth not Christ; this
   is not wonderful, for the death of blindness is the cause; but as soon
   as any man begins to live by the Spirit, he is immediately endued with
   eyes to see Christ. Now, the reason of this is, that our life is
   closely connected with the life of Christ, and proceeds from it as from
   its source; for we are dead in ourselves, and the life with which we
   flatter ourselves is a very bad death. Accordingly, when the question
   is, how we are to obtain life, our eyes must be directed to Christ, and
   his life must be conveyed to us by faith, that our consciences may be
   fully convinced, that, so long as Christ lives, we are free from all
   danger of destruction; for it is an undoubted truth, that his life
   would be nothing, when his members were dead.

   20. At that day Some refer this to the day of Pentecost; but it rather
   denotes the uninterrupted course, as it were, of a single day, from the
   time when Christ exerted the power of his Spirit till the last
   resurrection. From that time they began to know, but it was a sort of
   feeble beginning, because the Spirit had not yet wrought so powerfully
   in them. For the object of these words is, to show that we cannot, by
   indolent speculation, know what is the sacred and mystical union
   between us and him, and again, between him and the Father; but that the
   only way of knowing it is, when he diffuses his life in us by the
   secret efficacy of the Spirit; and this is the trial of faith, which I
   lately mentioned.

   As to the manner in which this passage was formerly abused by the
   Aryans, to prove that Christ is God only by participation and by grace,
   it is easy to refute their sophistry. For Christ does not speak merely
   of his eternal essence, but of that Divine power which was manifested
   in him. As the Father has laid up in the Son all fullness of blessings,
   so, on the other hand, the Son has conveyed himself entirely into us.
   He is said to be in us, because he plainly shows, by the efficacy of
   his Spirit, that he is the Author and the cause of our life.

   John 14:21-24

   21. He who hath my commandments, and keepeth them, is he that loveth
   me; and he that loveth me will be loved by my Father; and I will love
   him, and will manifest myself to him. 22. Judas (not Iscariot) saith to
   him, Lord, why is it [70] that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and
   not to the world? 23. Jesus answered and said to him, "If any one love
   me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come
   to him, and make our abode with him. 24. He who loveth me not keepeth
   not my words; and the word which you have heard is not mine, but that
   of the Father who sent me."


   21. He who hath my commandments. He again repeats the former statement,
   that the undoubted proof of our love to him lies in our keeping his
   commandments; and the reason why he so frequently reminds the disciples
   of this is, that they may not turn aside from this object; for there is
   nothing to which we are more prone than to slide into a carnal
   affection, so as to love something else than Christ under the name of
   Christ. Such is also the import of that saying of Paul,

   Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth we know him
   no longer in this manner. Let us therefore be a new creature,
   (2 Corinthians 5:16, 17.)

   To have his commandments means to be properly instructed in them; and
   to keep his commandments is to conform ourselves and our life to their
   rule.

   And he that loveth me will be loved by my Father. Christ speaks as if
   men loved God before he loved them; which is absurd, for,

   when we were enemies, he reconciled us to him,
   (Romans 5:10;)

   and the words of John are well known,

   Not that we first loved him, but he first loved us,
   (1 John 4:10.)

   But there is no debate here about cause or effect; and therefore there
   is no ground for the inference, that the love with which we love Christ
   comes in order before the love which God has toward us; for Christ
   meant only, that all who love him will be happy, because they will also
   be loved by him and by the Father; not that God then begins to love
   them, but because they have a testimony of his love to them, as a
   Father, engraven on their hearts. To the same purpose is the clause
   which immediately follows: --

   And I will manifest myself to him. Knowledge undoubtedly goes before
   love; but Christ's meaning was, I will grant to those who purely
   observe my doctrine, that they shall make progress from day to day in
   faith; "that is, "I will cause them to approach more nearly and more
   familiarly to me." Hence infer, that the fruit of piety is progress in
   the knowledge of Christ; for he who promises that he will give himself
   to him who has it rejects hypocrites, and causes all to make progress
   in faith who, cordially embracing the doctrine of the Gospel, bring
   themselves entirely into obedience to it. And this is the reason why
   many fall back, and why we scarcely see one in ten proceed in the right
   course; for the greater part do not deserve that he should manifest
   himself to them It ought also to be observed, that a more abundant
   knowledge of Christ is here represented as an extraordinary reward of
   our love to Christ; and hence it follows that it is an invaluable
   treasure.

   22. Judas (not Iscariot) saith to him. It is not without reason that he
   asks why Christ does not cause his light to be imparted [71] to more
   than a few persons; since he is the Sun of Righteousness, (Malachi 4:2)
   by whom the whole world ought to be enlightened; and, therefore, it is
   unreasonable that he should enlighten but a few, and not shed his light
   everywhere without distinction. Christ's reply does not solve the whole
   question; for it makes no mention of the first cause, why Christ
   manifested himself to a few,' conceals himself from the greater part of
   men; for certainly he finds all men at first alike, that is, entirely
   alienated from him; and, therefore, he cannot choose any person who
   loves him, but he chooses from among his enemies those whose hearts he
   bends to the love of him. But he did not intend, at present, to take
   any notice of that distinction, which was far from the object he had in
   view. His design was, to exhort his disciples to the earnest study of
   godliness, that they might make greater progress in faith; and,
   therefore, he is satisfied with distinguishing them from the world by
   this mark, that they keep the doctrine of the Gospel.

   Now, this mark comes after the commencement of faith, for it is the
   effect of their calling. In other passages, Christ had reminded the
   disciples of their being called by free grace, and he will afterwards
   bring it to their recollection. At present, he only enjoins them to
   observe his doctrine, and to maintain godliness. By these words, Christ
   shows in what manner the Gospel is properly obeyed. It is, when our
   services and outward actions proceed from the love of Christ; for in
   vain do the arms, and the feet, and the whole body toil, if the love of
   God does not reign in the heart, to govern the outward members. Now,
   since it is certain that we keep the commandments of Christ only in so
   far as we love him, it follows that a perfect love of him can nowhere
   be found in the world, because there is no man who keeps his
   commandments perfectly; yet God is pleased with the obedience of those
   who sincerely aim at this end.

   23. And my Father will love him. We have already explained that the
   love of God to us is not placed in the second rank, as if it came after
   our piety as the cause of that love, but that believers may be fully
   convinced that the obedience which they render to the Gospel is
   pleasing to God, and that they may continually expect from him fresh
   additions of gifts.

   And we will come to him who loveth me; that is, he will feel that the
   grace of God dwelleth in him, and will every day receive additions to
   the gifts of God. He therefore speaks, not of that eternal love with
   which he loved us, before we were born, and even before the world was
   created, but since the time when he seals it on our hearts by making us
   partakers of his adoption. Nor does he even mean the first
   illumination, but those degrees of faith by which believers must
   continually advance, according to that saying,

   Whosoever hath it shall be given to him, (Matthew 13:12.)

   The Papists; therefore are wrong in inferring from this passage that
   there are two kinds of love with which we love God. They falsely
   maintain that we naturally love God, before he regenerates us by his
   Spirit, and even that by this preparation we merit the grace of
   regeneration; as if Scripture did not everywhere teach, and as if
   experience also did not loudly proclaim, that we are altogether
   alienated from God, and that we are infected and filled with hatred of
   him, until he change our hearts. We must therefore keep in view the
   design of Christ, that he and the Father will come, to confirm
   believers, in uninterrupted confidence in his grace.

   24. He who loveth, me but keepeth not my words. As believers are mixed
   with unbelievers in the world, and as they must be agitated by various
   storms, as in a troubled sea, Christ again confirms them by this
   admonition, that they may not be drawn away by bad examples. As if he
   had said, "Do not look upon the world so as to depend on it; for there
   will always be some who despise me and my doctrine; but as for you,
   preserve constantly to the end the grace which you have once received."
   Yet he likewise intimates that the world is justly punished for its
   ingratitude, when it perishes in its blindness, since, by despising
   true righteousness, it manifests a wicked hatred towards Christ.

   And the word which you hear. That the disciples may not be discouraged
   or waver on account of the obstinacy of the world, he again procures
   credit to his doctrine, by testifying that it is from God, and that it
   was not contrived by men on the earth. And, indeed, the strength of our
   faith consists in our knowing that God is our leader, and that we are
   founded on nothing else than his eternal truth. Whatever then may be
   the rage and madness of the world, let us follow the doctrine of
   Christ, which rises far above heaven and earth. When he says that the
   word is not his, he accommodates himself to the disciples; as if he had
   said that it is not human, because he teaches faithfully what has been
   enjoined on him by the Father. Yet we know that, in so far as he is the
   eternal Wisdom of God, he is the only fountain of all doctrine, and
   that all the prophets who have been from the beginning spoke by his
   Spirit.

   John 14:25-28

   25. These things I have spoken to you, while I remain with you. 26. But
   the Comforter, (who is [72] ) the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
   send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will bring to your
   remembrance all things that I have said to you. 27. Peace I leave with
   you, my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I it to you.
   [73] Let not your heart be troubled, and let it not be afraid. 28. You
   heard that I said to you, I go away, and come to you. If you loved me,
   you would certainly rejoice that I said, I go to the Father; for the
   Father is greater than I.


   25. These things I have spoken to you. He adds this, that they may not
   despair, though they may have profited less than they ought to have
   done; for at that time he scattered a seed of doctrine, which lay
   hidden, and, as it were, suffocated in the disciples. He therefore
   exhorts them to entertain good hopes, until fruit be yielded by the
   doctrine which might now appear to be useless. In short, he testifies
   that in the doctrine which they had heard they have abundant ground of
   consolation, and that they ought not to seek it anywhere else. And if
   they do not immediately see it, he bids them be of good courage, until
   the Holy Spirit, who is the inward Teacher, speak the same thing in
   their hearts. This admonition is highly useful to all; for, if we do
   not immediately understand what Christ teaches, we begin to grow weary,
   and grudge to bestow unprofitable labor on what is obscure. But we must
   bring an eager desire to receive instruction; we must lend our ears and
   give attention, if we desire to make due proficiency in the school of
   God; and especially we need patience, until the Holy Spirit enable us
   to understand what we thought that we had often read or heard to no
   purpose. That the desire of learning may not be weakened in us, or that
   we may not fall into despair, when we do not immediately perceive the
   meaning of Christ speaking to us, let us know that this is spoken to us
   all.

   The Holy Spirit will bring to your remembrance all things that I have
   said to you. It is indeed a punishment threatened by Isaiah against
   unbelievers, that the Word of God shall be to them as a book that is
   sealed, (Isaiah 29:11) but in this manner, also, the Lord frequently
   humbles his people. We ought, therefore, to wait patiently and mildly
   for the time of revelation, and must not, on that account, reject the
   word. When Christ testifies that it is the peculiar office of the Holy
   Spirit to teach the apostles what they had already learned from his
   mouth, it follows that the outward preaching will be vain and useless,
   if it be not accompanied by the teaching of the Spirit. God has
   therefore two ways of teaching; for, first, he sounds in our ears by
   the mouth of men; and, secondly, he addresses us inwardly by his
   Spirit; and he does this either at the same moment, or at different
   times, as he thinks fit.

   But observe what are all these things which he promises that the Spirit
   will teach. He will suggest, he says, or bring to your remembrance, all
   that I have said. Hence it follows, that he will not be a builder of
   new revelations. By this single word we may refute all the inventions
   which Satan has brought into the Church from the beginning, under the
   pretense of the Spirit. Mahomet and the Pope agree in holding this as a
   principle of their religion, that Scripture does not contain a
   perfection of doctrine, but that something loftier has been revealed by
   the Spirit. From the same point the Anabaptists and Libertines, in our
   own time, have drawn their absurd notions. But the spirit that
   introduces any doctrine or invention apart from the Gospel is a
   deceiving spirit, and not the Spirit of Christ. What is meant by the
   Spirit being sent by the Father in the name of Christ, I have already
   explained.

   27. Peace I leave with you. By the word peace he means prosperity,
   which men are wont to wish for each other when they meet or part; for
   such is the import of the word peace in the Hebrew language. He
   therefore alludes to the ordinary custom of his nation; as if he had
   said, I give you my Farewell But he immediately adds, that this peace
   is of far greater value than that which is usually to be found among
   men, who generally have the word peace but coldly in their mouth, by
   way of ceremony, or, if they sincerely wish peace for any one, yet
   cannot actually bestow it. But Christ reminds them that his peace does
   not consist in an empty and unavailing wish, but is accompanied by the
   effect. In short, he says that he goes away from them in body, but that
   his peace remains with the disciples; that is, that they will be always
   happy through his blessing.

   Let not your heart be troubled. He again corrects the alarm which the
   disciples had felt on account of his departure. It is no ground for
   alarm, he tells them; for they want only his bodily presence, but will
   enjoy his actual presence through the Spirit. Let us learn to be always
   satisfied with this kind of presence, and let us not give a loose reign
   to the flesh, which always binds God by its outward inventions.

   28. If you loved me you would rejoice. The disciples unquestionably
   loved Christ, but not as they ought to have done; for some carnal
   affection was mixed with their love, so that they could not endure to
   be separated from him; but if they had loved him spiritually, there was
   nothing which they would have had more deeply at heart, than his return
   to the Father.

   For the Father is greater than I. This passage has been tortured in
   various ways. The Aryans, in order to prove that Christ is some sort of
   inferior God, argued that he is less than the Father The orthodox
   Fathers, to remove all ground for such a calumny, said that this must
   have referred to his human nature; but as the Aryans wickedly abused
   this testimony, so the reply given by the Fathers to their objection
   was neither correct nor appropriate; for Christ does not now speak
   either of his human nature, or of his eternal Divinity, but,
   accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself between God and
   us; and, indeed, as it has not been granted to us to reach the height
   of God, Christ descended to us, that he might raise us to it. You ought
   to have rejoiced, he says, because I return to the Father; for this is
   the ultimate object at which you ought to aim. By these words he does
   not show in what respect he differs in himself from the Father, but why
   he descended to us; and that was that he might unite us to God; for
   until we have reached that point, we are, as it were, in the middle of
   the course. We too imagine to ourselves but a half-Christ, and a
   mutilated Christ, if he do not lead us to God.

   There is a similar passage in the writings of Paul, where he says that
   Christ

   will deliver up the Kingdom to God his Father, that God may be all in
   all,
   (1 Corinthians 15:24.)

   Christ certainly reigns, not only in human nature, but as he is God
   manifested in the flesh. In what manner, therefore, will he lay aside
   the kingdom? It is, because the Divinity which is now beheld in
   Christ's face alone, will then be openly visible in him. The only point
   of difference is, that Paul there describes the highest perfection of
   the Divine brightness, the rays of which began to shine from the time
   when Christ ascended to heaven. To make the matter more clear, we must
   use still greater plainness of speech. Christ does not here make a
   comparison between the Divinity of the Father and his own, nor between
   his own human nature and the Divine essence of the Father, but rather
   between his present state and the heavenly glory, to which he would
   soon afterwards be received; as if he had said, "You wish to detain me
   in the world, but it is better that I should ascend to heaven." Let us
   therefore learn to behold Christ humbled in the flesh, so that he may
   conduct us to the fountain of a blessed immortality; for he was not
   appointed to be our guide, merely to raise us to the sphere of the moon
   or of the sun, but to make us one with God the Father.

   John 14:29-31

   29. And I have told you now, before it take place, that, when it shall
   take place, you may believe. 30. Henceforth I will not talk much with
   you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 31.
   But that the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do as
   the Father hath commanded me. Arise, let us go hence.


   29. And I have told you now. It was proper that the disciples should be
   frequently admonished on this point; for it was a secret far exceeding
   all human capacity. He testifies that he foretells what shall happen,
   that, when it has happened, they may believe; for it was a useful
   confirmation of their faith when they brought to recollection the
   predictions of Christ, and saw accomplished before their eyes what they
   had formerly heard from his mouth. Yet it appears to be a sort of
   concession, as if Christ had said, "Because you are not yet capable of
   comprehending so deep a mystery, I bear with you till the event has
   happened, which will serve as an interpreter to explain this doctrine."
   Although for a time he seemed to speak to the deaf, yet it afterwards
   appeared that his words were not scattered in vain, or, as we may say,
   in the air, but that it was a seed thrown into the earth. Now, as
   Christ speaks here about his word and the accomplishment of events, so
   his death, and resurrection, and ascension to heaven, are combined with
   doctrine, that they may produce faith in us.

   30. Henceforth I will not talk much with you. By this word he intended
   to fix the attention of the disciples on himself, and to impress his
   doctrine more deeply on their minds; for abundance generally takes away
   the appetite, and we desire more eagerly what we have not in our
   possession, and delight more in the enjoyment of that which is speedily
   to be taken from us. In order, therefore, to make them more desirous of
   hearing his doctrines, he threatens that he will very soon go away.
   Although Christ does not cease to teach us during the whole course of
   our life, yet this statement may be applied to our use; for, since the
   course of our life is short, we ought to embrace the present
   opportunity.

   For the prince of this world cometh He might have said, in direct
   language, that he would soon die, and that the hour of his death was at
   hand; but he makes use of a circumlocution, to fortify their minds
   beforehand, lest, terrified by a kind of death so hideous and
   detestable, they should faint; for to believe in him crucified, what is
   it but to seek life in hell? First, he says that his power will be
   given to Satan; and next he adds, That he will go away, not because he
   is compelled to do so, but in order to obey the Father.

   The devil is called the prince of this world, not because he has a
   kingdom separated from God, (as the Manicheans imagined,) but because,
   by God's permission, he exercises his tyranny over the world. Whenever,
   therefore, we hear this designation applied to the devil, let us be
   ashamed of our miserable condition; for, whatever may be the pride of
   men, they are the slaves of the devil, till they are regenerated by the
   Spirit of Christ; for under the term world is here included the whole
   human race. There is but one Deliverer who frees and rescues us from
   this dreadful slavery. Now, since this punishment was inflicted on
   account of the sin of the first man, and since it daily grows worse on
   account of new sins, let us learn to hate both ourselves and our sins.
   While we are held captives under the dominion of Satan, still this
   slavery does not free us from blame, for it is voluntary. It ought also
   to be observed, that what is done by wicked men is here ascribed to the
   devil; for, since they are impelled by Satan, all that they do is
   justly reckoned his work.

   And hath nothing in me. [74] It is in consequence of the sin of Adam
   that Satan holds the dominion of death, and, therefore, he could not
   touch Christ, who is pure from all the pollution of sin, if he had not
   voluntarily subjected himself. And yet I think that these words have a
   wider meaning than that in which they are usually explained; for the
   ordinary interpretation is, "Satan hath found nothing in Christ, for
   there is nothing in him that deserves death, because he is pure from
   every stain of sin." But, in my opinion, Christ asserts here not only
   his own purity, but likewise his Divine power, which was not subject to
   death; for it was proper to assure the disciples that he did not yield
   through weakness, lest they should think less highly of his power. But
   in this general statement the former is also included, that, in
   enduring death, he was not compelled by Satan. Hence we infer, that he
   was substituted in our room, when he submitted to death.

   31. But that the world may know. Some think that these words should be
   read as closely connected with the words, Arise, let us go hence, so as
   to make the sense complete. Others read the former part of the verse
   separately, and suppose that it breaks off abruptly. As it makes no
   great difference in regard to the meaning, I leave it to the reader to
   give a preference to either of these views. What chiefly deserves our
   attention is, that the decree of God is here placed in the highest
   rank; that we may not suppose that Christ was dragged to death by the
   violence of Satan, in such a manner that anything happened contrary to
   the purpose of God. It was God who appointed his Son to be the
   Propitiation, and who determined that the sins of the world should be
   expiated by his death. In order to accomplish this, he permitted Satan,
   for a short time, to treat him with scorn; as if he had gained a
   victory over him. Christ, therefore, does not resist Satan, in order
   that he may obey the decree of his Father, and may thus offer his
   obedience as the ransom of our righteousness.

   Arise, let us go hence. Some think that Christ, after he said these
   things, changed his place, and that what follows was spoken by him on
   the road; but as John afterwards adds, that Christ went away with his
   disciples beyond the brook Kedron, [75] it appears more probable that
   Christ intended to exhort the disciples to render the same obedience to
   God, of which they beheld in him so illustrious an example, and not
   that he led them away at that moment.

   John 15:1-6

   1. I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman. 2. Every branch
   in me that beareth not fruit he will take away, and every branch that
   beareth fruit he will prune, that it may bear more fruit. 3. You are
   already clean, on account of the word which I have spoken to you. 4.
   Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
   unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in
   me. 5. I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abideth in me, and I
   in him, beareth much fruit; for without me you can do nothing. 6. If
   any one abide not in me, he shall be cast out, and wither as a branch;
   and men shall gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it shall be
   burned.


   1. I am the true Vine. The general meaning of this comparison is, that
   we are, by nature, barren and dry, except in so far as we have been
   engrafted into Christ, and draw from him a power which is new, and
   which does not proceed from ourselves. I have followed other
   commentators in rendering ampelos by vitis, (a vine,) and klemata by
   palmites, (branches.) Now, vitis (a vine) strictly denotes the plant
   itself, and not a field planted with vines, which the Latin writers
   call vinea, (a vineyard;) although it is sometimes taken for vinea a
   vineyard; as, for example, when Cicero mentions in the same breath,
   pauperum agellos et vlticulas, the small fields and small vineyards of
   the poor Palmites (branches) are what may be called the arms of the
   tree, which it sends out above the ground. But as the Greek word kloma
   sometimes denotes a vine, and ampelos, a vineyard, I am more disposed
   to adopt the opinion, that Christ compares himself to a field planted
   with vines, and compares us to the plants themselves. On that point,
   however, I will not enter into a debate with any person; only I wish to
   remind the reader, that he ought to adopt that view which appears to
   him to derive greater probability from the context.

   First, let him remember the rule which ought to be observed in all
   parables; that we ought not to examine minutely every property of the
   vine, but only to take a general view of the object to which Christ
   applies that comparison. Now, there are three principal parts; first,
   that we have no power of doing good but what comes from himself;
   secondly, that we, having a root in him, are dressed and pruned by the
   Father; thirdly, that he removes the unfruitful branches, that they may
   be thrown into the fire and burned.

   There is scarcely any one who is ashamed to acknowledge that every
   thing good which he possesses comes from God; but, after making this
   acknowledgment, they imagine that universal grace has been given to
   them, as if it had been implanted in them by nature. But Christ dwells
   principally on this, that the vital sap -- that is, all life and
   strength [76] -- proceeds from himself alone. Hence it follows, that
   the nature of man is unfruitful and destitute of everything good;
   because no man has the nature of a vine, till he be implanted in him.
   But this is given to the elect alone by special grace. So then, the
   Father is the first Author of all blessings, who plants us with his
   hand; but the commencement of life is in Christ, since we begin to take
   root in him. When he calls himself the true vine the meaning is, I am
   truly the vine, and therefore men toil to no purpose in seeking
   strength anywhere else, for from none will useful fruit proceed but
   from the branches which shall be produced by me.

   2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit As some men corrupt the
   grace of God, others suppress it maliciously, and others choke it by
   carelessness, Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry,
   by declaring that all the branches which shall be unfruitful will be
   cut off from the vine But here comes a question. Can any one who is
   engrafted into Christ be without fruit? I answer, many are supposed to
   be in the vine, according to the opinion of men, who actually have no
   root in the vine Thus, in the writings of the prophets, the Lord calls
   the people of Israel his vine, because, by outward profession, they had
   the name of The Church.

   And every branch that beareth, fruit he pruneth. By these words, he
   shows that believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented
   from degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God
   continually apply his hand; for it will not be enough to have been once
   made partakers of adoption, if God do not continue the work of his
   grace in us. He speaks of pruning or cleansing, [77] because our flesh
   abounds in superfluities and destructive vices, and is too fertile in
   producing them, and because they grow and multiply without end, if we
   are not cleansed or pruned [78] by the hand of God. When he says that
   vines are pruned, that they may yield more abundant fruit, he shows
   what ought to be the progress of believers in the course of true
   religion? [79]

   3. You are already clean, on account of the word. He reminds them that
   they have already experienced in themselves what he had said; that they
   have been planted in him, and have also been cleansed or pruned He
   points out the means of pruning, namely, doctrine; and there can be no
   doubt that he speaks of outward preaching, for he expressly mentions
   the word, which they had heard from his mouth. Not that the word
   proceeding from the mouth of a man has so great efficacy, but, so far
   as Christ works in the heart by the Spirit, the word itself is the
   instrument of cleansing Yet Christ does not mean that the apostles are
   pure from all sin, but he holds out to them their experience, that they
   may learn from it that the continuance of grace is absolutely
   necessary. Besides, he commends to them the doctrine of the gospel from
   the fruit which it produces, that they may be more powerfully excited
   to meditate on it continually, since it resembles the vine-dresser's
   knife to take away what is useless.

   4. Abide in me. He again exhorts them to be earnest and careful in
   keeping the grace which they had received, for the carelessness of the
   flesh can never be sufficiently aroused. And, indeed, Christ has no
   other object in view than to keep us

   as a hen keepeth her chickens under her wings,
   (Matthew 23:37)

   lest our indifference should carry us away, and make us fly to our
   destruction. In order to prove that he did not begin the work of our
   salvation for the purpose of leaving it imperfect in the middle of the
   course, he promises that his Spirit will always be efficacious in us,
   if we do not prevent him. Abide in me, says he; for I am ready to abide
   in you And again, He who abideth in me beareth much fruit. By these
   words he declares that all who have a living root in him are
   fruit-bearing branches

   5. Without me you can do nothing. This is the conclusion and
   application of the whole parable. So long as we are separate from him,
   we bear no fruit that is good and acceptable to God, for we are unable
   to do anything good. The Papists not only extenuate this statement, but
   destroy its substance, and, indeed, they altogether evade it; for,
   though in words they acknowledge that we can do nothing without Christ,
   yet they foolishly imagine that they possess some power, which is not
   sufficient in itself, but, being aided by the grace of God, co-operates
   (as they say,) that is, works along with it; [80] for they cannot
   endure that man should be so much annihilated as to do nothing of
   himself. But these words of Christ are too plain to be evaded so easily
   as they suppose. The doctrine invented by the Papists is, that we can
   do nothing without Christ, but that, aided by him, we have something of
   ourselves in addition to his grace. But Christ, on the other hand,
   declares that we can do nothing of ourselves. The branch, he says,
   beareth not fruit of itself; and, therefore, he not only extols the aid
   of his co-operating grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but
   what he imparts to us. Accordingly, this phrase, without me, must be
   explained as meaning, except from me.

   Next follows another sophism; for they allege that the branch has
   something from nature, for if another branch, which is not
   fruit-bearing, be engrafted in the vine, it will produce nothing. But
   this is easily answered; for Christ does not explain what the branch
   has naturally, before it become united to the vine, but rather means
   that we begin to become branches at the time when we are united to him.
   And, indeed, Scripture elsewhere shows that, before we are in him, we
   are dry and useless wood.

   6. If any one abide not in me. He again lays before them the punishment
   of ingratitude, and, by doing so, excites and urges them to
   perseverance. It is indeed the gift of God, but the exhortation to fear
   is not uncalled for, lest our flesh, through too great indulgence,
   should root us out.

   He is cast out, and withered, like a branch. Those who are cut off from
   Christ are said to wither like a dead branch; because, as the
   commencement of strength is from him, so also is its uninterrupted
   continuance. Not that it ever happens that any one of the elect is
   dried up, but because there are many hypocrites who, in outward
   appearance, flourish and are green for a time, but who afterwards, when
   they ought to yield fruit, show the very opposite of that which the
   Lord expects and demands from his people. [81]

   John 15:7-11

   7. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what
   you will, [82] and it shall be done for you. 8. In this my Father is
   glorified, that you bear much fruit, and become my disciples. 9. As the
   Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love. 10. If you
   keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, as I also have kept my
   Father's commandments, and abide in his love. 11. These things I have
   spoken to you, that my joy may abide in you, and that your joy may be
   full.


   7. If you abide in me. Believers often feel that they are starved, and
   are very far from that rich fatness which is necessary for yielding
   abundant fruit. For this reason it is expressly added, whatever those
   who are in Christ may need, there is a remedy provided for their
   poverty, as soon as they ask it from God. This is a very useful
   admonition; for the Lord often suffers us to hunger, in order to train
   us to earnestness in prayer. But if we fly to him, we shall never want
   what we ask, but, out of his inexhaustible abundance, he will supply us
   with every thing that we need, (1 Corinthians 1:5.)

   If my words abide in you. He means that we take root in him by faith;
   for as soon as we have departed from the doctrine of the Gospel, we
   seek Christ separately from himself. When he promises that he will
   grant whatever we wish, he does not give us leave to form wishes
   according to our own fancy. God would do what was ill fitted to promote
   our welfare, if he were so indulgent and so ready to yield to us; for
   we know well that men often indulge in foolish and extravagant desires.
   But here he limits the wishes of his people to the rule of praying in a
   right manner, and that rule subjects, to the good pleasure of God, all
   our affections. This is confirmed by the connection in which the words
   stand; for he means that his people will or desire not riches, or
   honors, or any thing of that nature, which the flesh foolishly desires,
   but the vital sap of the Holy Spirit, Which enables them to bear fruit.

   8. In this my Father is glorified This is a confirmation of the former
   statement; for he shows that we ought not to doubt that God will listen
   to the prayers of his people, when they desire to be rendered fruitful;
   for this contributes very greatly to his glory. But by this end or
   effect he likewise kindles in them the desire of doing good; for there
   is nothing which we ought to value more highly than that the name of
   God may be glorified by us. To the same effect is the latter clause,
   that you may become my disciples; for he declares that he has no one in
   his flock who does not bear fruit to the glory of God.

   9. As the Father hath loved me. He intended to express something far
   greater than is commonly supposed; for they who think that he now
   speaks of the sacred love of God the Father, which he always had
   towards the Son, philosophize away from the subject; for it was rather
   the design of Christ to lay, as it were, in our bosom a sure pledge of
   God's love towards us. That abstruse inquiry, as to the manner in which
   the Father always loved himself in the Son, has nothing to do with the
   present passage. But the love which is here mentioned must be
   understood as referring to us, because Christ testifies that the Father
   loves him, as he is the Head of the Church. And this is highly
   necessary for us; for he who without a Mediator, inquires how he is
   loved by God, involves him in a labyrinth, in which he will neither
   discover the entrance, nor the means of extricating himself. We ought
   therefore to cast our eyes on Christ, in whom will be found the
   testimony and pledge of the love of God; for the love of God was fully
   poured out on him, that from him it might flow to his members. He is
   distinguished by this title, that he is the beloved Son, in whom the
   will of the Father is satisfied, (Matthew 3:17.) But we ought to
   observe the end, which is, that God may accept us in him. So, then, we
   may contemplate in him, as in a mirror, God's paternal love towards us
   all; because he is not loved apart, or for his own private advantage,
   but that he may unite us with him to the Father.

   Abide in my love. Some explain this to mean, that Christ demands from
   his disciples mutual love; but others explain it better, who understand
   it to mean the love of Christ towards us. He means that we should
   continually enjoy that love with which he once loved us, and,
   therefore, that we ought to take care not to deprive ourselves of it;
   for many reject the grace which is offered to them, and many throw away
   what they once had in their hands. So, then, since we have been once
   received into the grace of Christ, we must see that we do not fall from
   it through our own fault.

   The conclusion which some draw from these words, that there is no
   efficacy in the grace of God. unless it be aided by our steadfastness,
   is frivolous. For I do not admit that the Spirit demands from us no
   more than what is in our own power, but he shows us what we ought to
   do, that, if our strength be deficient, we may seek it from some other
   quarter. In like manner, when Christ exhorts us, in this passage, to
   perseverance, we must; not rely on our own strength and industry, but
   we ought to pray to him who commands us, that he would confirm us in
   his love.

   10. If you keep my commandments. He points out to us the method of
   perseverance. his, to follow where he calls, for, as Paul says,

   They who are in Christ walk not according to the flesh, but according
   to the Spirit,
   (Romans 8:1.)

   For these two things are continually united, that faith which perceives
   the undeserved love of Christ toward us, and a good conscience and
   newness of life. And, indeed, Christ does not reconcile believers to
   the Father, that they may indulge in wickedness without reserve, and
   without punishment; but that, governing them by his Spirit, he may keep
   them under the authority and dominion of his Father. Hence it follows,
   that the love of Christ is rejected by those who do not prove, by true
   obedience, that they are his disciples.

   If any one object that, in that case, the security of our salvation
   depends on ourselves, I reply, it is wrong to give such a meaning to
   Christ's words; for the obedience which believers render to him is not
   the cause why he continues his love toward us, but is rather the effect
   of his love. For whence comes it that they answer to their calling, but
   because they are led by the Spirit of adoption of free grace?

   But again, it may be thought that the condition imposed on us is too
   difficult, that we should keep the commandments of Christ, which
   contain the absolute perfection of righteousness, -- a perfection which
   far exceeds our capacity, -- for hence it follows, that the love of
   Christ will be useless, if we be not endued with angelical purity. The
   answer is easy; for when Christ speaks of the desire of living a good
   and holy life, he does not exclude what is the chief article in his
   doctrine, namely, that which alludes to righteousness being freely
   imputed, in consequence of which, through a free pardon, our duties are
   acceptable to God, which in themselves deserved to be rejected as
   imperfect and unholy. Believers, therefore, are reckoned as keeping the
   commandments of Christ when they apply their earnest attention to them,
   though they be far distant from the object at which they aim; for they
   are delivered from that rigorous sentence of the law,

   Cursed be he that hath not confirmed all the words of this law to do
   them,
   (Deuteronomy 27:26).

   As I also have kept my Father's commandments. As we have been elected
   in Christ, so in him the image of our calling is exhibited to us in a
   lively manner; and therefore he justly holds himself out to us as a
   pattern, to the imitation of which all the godly ought to be conformed.
   "In me," says he, "is brightly displayed the resemblance of those
   things which I demand from you; for you see how sincerely I am devoted
   to obedience to my Father, and how I persevere in this course. My
   Father, too, hath loved me, not for a moment, or for a short time, but
   his love toward me is constant." This conformity between the Head and
   the members ought to be always placed before our eyes, not only that
   believers may form themselves after the example of Christ, but that,
   they may entertain a confident hope that his Spirit will every day form
   them anew to be better and better, that they may walk to the end in
   newness of life.

   11. These things I have spoken to you. He adds, that his love is far
   from being unknown to the godly, but that it is perceived by faith, so
   that they enjoy blessed peace of conscience; for the joy which he
   mentions springs from that peace with God which is possessed by all
   that have been justified by free grace. As often, then, as God's
   fatherly love towards us is preached, let us know that there is given
   to us ground for true joy, that, with peaceable consciences, we may be
   certain of our salvation.

   My joy and your joy. It is called Christ's joy and our joy in various
   respects. It is Christ's, because it is given to us by him; for he is
   both the Author and the Cause of it. I say that he is the Cause of it,
   because we were freed from guilt, when

   the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, (Isaiah 53:5.)

   I call him also the Author of it, because by his Spirit he drives away
   dread and anxiety in our hearts, and then arises that calm
   cheerfulness. It is said to be ours for a different reason; because we
   enjoy it since it has been given to us. Now since Christ declares that
   he spake these things, that the disciples might have joy, we conclude
   from these words, that all who have duly profited by this sermon have
   something on which they can rest.

   That my joy may abide in you. By the word abide he means, that it is
   not a fleeting or temporary joy of which he speaks, but a joy which
   never fails or passes away. Let us therefore learn that we ought to
   seek in the doctrine of Christ the assurance of salvation, which
   retains its vigor both in life and in death.

   That your joy may be full. He adds, that this joy will be solid and
   full; not that believers will be entirely free from all sadness, but
   that the ground for joy will be far greater, so that no dread, no
   anxiety, no grief, will swallow them up; for those to whom it has been
   given to glory in Christ will not be prevented, either by life, or by
   death, or by any distresses, from bidding defiance to sadness.

   John 15:12-15

   12. This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved
   you. 13. Greater love hath no one than this, that one should lay down
   his life for his friends. 14. You are my friends, if you do the things
   that I command you. [83] 15. Henceforth I will not call you servants,
   for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you
   friends, because I have made known to you all things that I have heard
   from my Father.


   12. This is my commandment. Since it is proper that we regulate our
   life according to the commandment of Christ, it is necessary, first of
   all, that we should understand what it is that he wills or commands He
   now therefore repeats what he had formerly said, that it is his will,
   above all things, that believers should cherish mutual love among
   themselves. True, the love and reverence for God comes first in order,
   but as the true proof of it is love toward our neighbors, he dwells
   chiefly on this point. Besides, as he formerly held himself out for a
   pattern in maintaining the general doctrine, so he now holds himself
   out for a pattern in a particular instance; for he loved all his
   people, that they may love each other. Of the reason why he lays down
   no express rule, in this passage, about loving unbelievers, we have
   spoken under the former chapter.

   13. Greater love hath no one than this. Christ sometimes proclaims the
   greatness of his love to us, that he may more fully confirm our
   confidence in our salvation; but now he proceeds further, in order to
   inflame us, by his example, to love the brethren. Yet he joins both
   together; for he means that we should taste by faith how inestimably
   delightful his goodness is, and next he allures us, in this way, to
   cultivate brotherly love. Thus Paul writes:

   Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for
   us an offering and sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savor,
   (Ephesians 5:2.)

   God might have redeemed us by a single word, or by a mere act of his
   will, if he had not thought it better to do otherwise for our own
   benefit, that, by not sparing his own well-beloved Son, he might
   testify in his person how much he cares for our salvation. But now our
   hearts, if they are not softened by the inestimable sweetness of Divine
   love, must be harder than stone or iron.

   But a question is put. How did Christ die for friends, since

   we were enemies, before he reconciled us, (Romans 5:10;)

   for, by expiating our sins through the sacrifice of his death, he
   destroyed the enmity that was between God and us? The answer to this
   question will be found under the third chapter, where we said that, in
   reference to us, there is a state of variance between us and God, till
   our sins are blotted out by the death of Christ; but that the cause of
   this grace, which has been manifested in Christ, was the [84] In this
   way, too, Christ laid down his life for those who were strangers, but
   whom, even while they were strangers, he loved, otherwise he would not
   have died for them.

   14. You are my friends. He does not mean that we obtain so great an
   honor by our own merit, but only reminds them of the condition on which
   he receives us into favor, and deigns to reckon us among his friends;
   as he said a little before,

   If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,
   (John 15:10.)

   For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared, teaching us that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and
   righteously, and piously, in this world,
   (Titus 2:11.)

   But ungodly men, who, through wicked contempt of the Gospel, want only
   oppose Christ, renounce his friendship.

   15. Henceforth I will not call you servants. By another argument he
   shows his love toward the disciples, which was, that he opened his mind
   fully to them, as familiar communication is maintained among friends.
   "I have condescended," he says, "far more to you than a mortal man is
   wont to condescend to his servants Let this be regarded by you,
   therefore, as a pledge of my love toward you, that I have, in a kind
   and friendly manner, explained to you the secrets of heavenly wisdom
   which I had heard from the Father." It is indeed a noble commendation
   of the Gospel, that we have the heart of Christ opened (so to speak) in
   it, so that we can no longer doubt of it or perceive it slightly. We
   have no reason for desiring to rise above the clouds, or to penetrate
   into the deep, (Romans 10:6, 7) to obtain the certainty of our
   salvation. Let us be satisfied with this testimony of his love toward
   us which is contained in the Gospel, for it will never deceive us.
   Moses said to the ancient people,

   What nation under heaven is so highly favored as to have God near to
   them, as God talked, with you this day?
   (Deuteronomy 4:7.)

   But far higher is the distinction which God hath conferred on us, since
   God hath entirely conveyed himself to us in his Son. So much the
   greater is the ingratitude and wickedness of those who, not satisfied
   with the admirable wisdom of the Gospel, fly with proud eagerness to
   new speculations.

   All that I have heard from my Father. It is certain that the disciples
   did not know all that Christ knew, and indeed it was impossible that
   they should attain to so great a height; and because the wisdom of God
   is incomprehensible, he distributed to each of them a certain measure
   of knowledge, according as he judged to be necessary. Why then does he
   say that he revealed all things? I answer, this is limited to the
   person and office of the Mediator. He places himself between God and
   us, having received out of the secret sanctuary of God those things
   which he should deliver to us -- as the phrase is -- from hand to hand.
   Not one of those things, therefore, which related to our salvation, and
   which it was of importance for us to know was omitted by Christ in the
   instructions given to his disciples. Thus, so far as he was appointed
   to be the Master and Teacher of the Church, he heard nothing from the
   Father which he did not faithfully teach his disciples. Let us only
   have an humble desire and readiness to learn, and we shall feel that
   Paul has justly called the Gospel wisdom to make men perfect,
   (Colossians 1:28.)

   John 15:16-21

   16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you; and I have ordained
   you to go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should continue; that
   whatever you shall ask from the Father in my name he may give you. 17.
   These things I command you, that you may love another. 18. If the world
   hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you. 19. If you
   were of the world, the world would love what was its own; but because
   you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
   therefore the world hateth you. 20. Remember the word which I said to
   you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have
   persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word,
   they will keep yours also. 21. But all these things they will do to you
   on account of my name, because they know not him who sent me.


   16. You have not chosen me. He declares still more clearly that it must
   not be ascribed to their own merit, but to his grace, that they have
   arrived at so great an honor; for when he says that he was not chosen
   by them, it is as if he had said, that whatever they have they did not
   obtain by their own skill or industry. Men commonly imagine some kind
   of concurrence to take place between the grace of God and the will of
   man; but that contrast, I chose you, I was not chosen by you, claims,
   exclusively, for Christ alone what is usually divided between Christ
   and man; as if he had said, that a man is not moved of his own accord
   to seek Christ, until he has been sought by him.

   True, the subject now in hand is not the ordinary election of
   believers, by which they are adopted to be the children of God, but
   that special election, by which he set apart his disciples to the
   office of preaching the Gospel. But if it was by free gift, and not by
   their own merit, that they were chosen to the apostolic office, much
   more is it certain that the election, by which, from being the children
   of wrath and an accursed seed, we become the children of God, is of
   free grace. Besides, in this passage Christ magnifies his grace, by
   which they had been chosen to be Apostles, so as to join with it that
   former election by which they had been engrafted into the body of the
   Church; or rather, he includes in these words all the dignity and honor
   which he had conferred on them. Yet I acknowledge that Christ treats
   expressly of the apostleship; for his design is, to excite the
   disciples to execute their office diligently and faithfully. [85]

   He takes, as the ground of his exhortation, the undeserved favor which
   he had bestowed on them; for the greater our obligations to the Lord,
   the more earnest ought we to be in performing the duties which he
   demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for us to avoid the
   charge of base ingratitude. Hence it appears that there is nothing
   which ought more powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a holy and
   religious life, than when we acknowledge that we owe every thing to
   God, and that we have nothing that is our own; that both the
   commencement of our salvation, and all the parts which follow from it,
   flow from his undeserved mercy. Besides, how true this statement of
   Christ is, may be clearly perceived from the fact, that Christ chose to
   be his apostles those who might have been thought to be the most unfit
   of all for the office; though in their person he intended to preserve
   an enduring monument of his grace. For, as Paul says, (1 Corinthians
   2:16,) who among men shall be found fit for discharging the embassy by
   which God reconciles mankind to himself? Or rather, what mortal is able
   to represent the person of God? It is Christ alone who makes them fit
   by his election. Thus Paul ascribes his apostleship to grace, (Romans
   1:5,) and again mentions that

   he had been separated from his mother's womb,
   (Galatians 1:15.)

   Nay more, since we are altogether useless servants, those who appear to
   be the most excellent of all will not be fit for the smallest calling,
   till they have been chosen. Yet the higher the degree of honor to which
   any one has been raised, let him remember that he is under the deeper
   obligations to God.

   And I have appointed you. The election is hidden till it is actually
   made known, when a man receives an office to which he had been
   appointed; as Paul, in the passage which I quoted a little ago, where
   he says that he had been separated from his mother's womb, adds, that
   he was created an apostle, because it so pleased God His words are:

   When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called
   me by his grace,
   (Galatians 1:15.)

   Thus also the Lord testifies that he knew Jeremiah before he was in his
   mother's womb, (Jeremiah 1:5,) though he calls him to the prophetical
   office at the proper and appointed time. It may happen, no doubt, that
   one who is duly qualified enters into the office of teaching; or
   rather, it usually happens in the Church that no one is called till he
   be endued and furnished with the necessary qualifications. That Christ
   declares himself to be the Author of both is not wonderful; since it is
   only by him that God acts, and he acts along with the Father. So then,
   both election and ordination belong equally to both.

   That you may go. He now points out the reason why he mentioned his
   grace. It was, to make them apply more earnestly to the work. The
   apostleship was not a place of honor without toil, but they had to
   contend with very great difficulties; and therefore Christ encourages
   them not to shrink from labors, and annoyances, and dangers. This
   argument is drawn from the end which they ought to have in view; but
   Christ reasons from the effect, when he says,

   That you may bear fruit; for it is hardly possible that any one would
   devote himself earnestly and diligently to the work, if he did not
   expect that the labor would bring some advantage. Christ, therefore,
   declares that their efforts will not be useless or unsuccessful,
   provided that they are ready to obey and follow when he calls them.
   [86] For he not only enjoins on the apostles what their calling
   involves and demands, but promises to them also prosperity and success,
   that they may not be cold or indifferent. It is hardly possible to tell
   how great is the value of this consolation against those numerous
   temptations which daily befall the ministers of Christ. Whenever, then,
   we see that we are losing our pains, let us call to remembrance that
   Christ will, at length, prevent our exertions from being vain or
   unproductive; for the chief accomplishment of this promise is at the
   very time when there is no appearance of fruit. Scorners, and those
   whom the world looks upon as wise men, ridicule our attempts as
   foolish, and tell us that it is in vain for us to attempt to mingle
   heaven and earth; because the fruit does not yet correspond to our
   wishes. But since Christ, on the contrary, has promised that the happy
   result, though concealed for a time, will follow, let us labor
   diligently in the discharge of our duty amidst the mockeries of the
   world.

   And that your fruit may abide. A question now arises, why does Christ
   say that this fruit will be perpetual? As the doctrine of the Gospel
   obtains souls to Christ for eternal salvation, many think that this is
   the perpetuity of the fruit But I extend the statement much farther, as
   meaning that the Church will last to the very end of the world; for the
   labor of the apostles yields fruit even in the present day, and our
   preaching is not for a single age only, but will enlarge the Church, so
   that new fruit will be seen to spring up after our death.

   When he says, your fruit, he speaks as if it had been obtained by their
   own industry, though Paul teaches that they who plant or water are
   nothing, (1 Corinthians 3:7.) And, indeed, the formation of the Church
   is so excellent a work of God, that the glory of it ought not to be
   ascribed to men. But as the Lord displays his power by the agency of
   men, that they may not labor in vain, he is wont to transfer to them
   even that which belongs peculiarly to himself. Yet let us remember
   that, when he so graciously commends his disciples, it is to encourage,
   and not to puff them up.

   That your Father may give you all that you ask in my name. This clause
   was not added abruptly, as many might suppose; for, since the office of
   teaching far exceeds the power of men, there are added to it
   innumerable attacks of Satan, which never could be warded off but by
   the power of God. That the apostles may not be discouraged, Christ
   meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had said, "If the work
   assigned to you be so great that you are unable to fulfill the duties
   of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I have appointed
   you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that my Father
   will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you pray to
   him, in my name, to grant you assistance." And, indeed, that the
   greater part of teachers either languish through indolence, or utterly
   give way through despair, arises from nothing else than that they are
   sluggish in the duty of prayer.

   This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us to call upon God; for
   whoever acknowledges that the success of his work depends on God alone,
   will offer his labor to him with fear and trembling. On the other hand,
   if any one, relying on his own industry, disregard the assistance of
   God, he will either throw away his spear and shield, when he comes to
   the trial, or he will be busily employed, but without any advantage.
   Now, we must here guard against two faults, pride and distrust; for, as
   the assistance of God is fearlessly disregarded by those who think that
   the matter is already in their own power, so many yield to
   difficulties, because they do not consider that they fight through the
   power and protection of God, under whose banner they go forth to war.

   17. These things I command you. This too, was appropriately added, that
   the Apostles might know that mutual love among ministers is demanded
   above all things, that they may be employed, with one accord, in
   building up the Church of God; for there is no greater hindrance than
   when every one labors apart, and when all do not direct their exertions
   to the common good. If, then, ministers do not maintain brotherly
   intercourse with each other, they may possibly erect some large heaps,
   but latterly disjointed and confused; and, all the while, there will be
   no building of a Church.

   18. If the world hate you. After having armed the Apostles for the
   battle, Christ exhorts them likewise to patience; for the Gospel cannot
   be published without instantly driving the world to rage. Consequently,
   it will never be possible for godly teachers to avoid the hatred of the
   world. Christ gives them early information of this, that they may not
   be instances of what usually happens to raw recruits, who, from wont of
   experience, are valiant before they have seen their enemies, but who
   tremble as soon as the battle is commenced. And not only does Christ
   forewarn his disciples, that nothing may happen to them which is new
   and unexpected, but likewise confirms them by his example; for it is
   not reasonable that Christ should be hated by the world, and that we,
   who represent his person, should have the world on our side, which is
   always like itself.

   You know. I have translated the verb ginoskete in the indicative mood,
   you know; but if any one prefer to translate it in the imperative mood,
   know ye, I have no objection, for it makes no change in the meaning.
   There is greater difficulty in the phrase which immediately follows,
   proton humon, before you; for when he says that he is before the
   disciples, this may be referred either to time or to rank The former
   exposition has been more generally received, namely, that Christ was
   hated by the world before the Apostles were hated But I prefer the
   second exposition, namely, that Christ, who is far exalted above them,
   was not exempted from the hatred of the world, and therefore his
   ministers ought not to refuse the same condition; for the phraseology
   is the same as that which we have seen twice before, in John 1:27 and
   30, He who cometh after me is preferred to me, (hoti protos mou en,)
   for he was before me

   19. If you were of the world. This is another consolation, that the
   reason why they are hated by the world is, that they have been
   separated from it. Now, this is their true happiness and glory, for in
   this manner they have been rescued from destruction.

   But I have chosen you out of the world. To choose means here to
   separate Now, if they were chosen out of the world, it follows that
   they were a part of the world, and that it is only by the mercy of God
   that they are distinguished from the rest who perish. Again, by the
   term, the world, Christ describes, in this passage, all who have not
   been regenerated by the Spirit of God; for he contrasts the Church with
   the world, as we shall see more fully under the seventeenth chapter.
   And yet this doctrine does not contradict the exhortation of Paul,

   Be at peace with all men, as far as lieth in you,
   (Romans 12:18;)

   for the exception which he adds amounts to saying, that we ought to see
   what is right and proper for us to do that no man, by seeking to please
   the world, may give himself up to its corruptions.

   But there is still another objection that may be urged; for we see that
   it commonly happens that wicked men, who are of the world, are not only
   hated, but accursed by others. In this respect, certainly, the world
   loveth not what is its own. I reply, earthly men, who are regulated by
   the perception of their flesh, never have a true hatred of sin, but
   only so far as they are affected by the consideration of their own
   convenience or injury. And yet the intention of Christ was not to deny
   that the world foams and rages within itself by internal quarrels. He
   only intended to show, that the world hates nothing in believers but
   what is of God. And hence, too, it plainly appears how foolish are the
   dreams of the Anabaptists, who conclude, from this single argument that
   they are the servants of God, because they displease the greater part
   of men. For it is easy to reply, that many who are of the world favor
   their doctrine, because they are delighted at the thought of having
   every thing in shameful confusion; while many who are out of the world
   hate it, because they are desirous that the good order of the state
   should remain unbroken.

   20. Remember the word. It might also be read in the indicative mood,
   You remember the word, and the meaning is not very different; but I
   think that it is more suitable to read it in the imperative mood,
   Remember the word. It is a confirmation of what Christ had spoken
   immediately before, when he said that he was hated by the world, though
   he was far more excellent than his disciples; for it is unreasonable
   that the condition of the servant should be better than that of his
   master Having spoken of persons, he likewise makes mention of doctrine.

   If they have heard my word, they will keep yours also. Nothing gives
   greater uneasiness to the godly than when they see the doctrine, which
   is of God, haughtily despised by men; for it is truly shocking and
   dreadful, and the sight of it might shake the stoutest heart. But when
   we remember on the other hand, that not less obstinate resistance was
   manifested against the Son of God himself, we need not wonder that the
   doctrine of God is so little reverenced among men. When he calls it his
   doctrine and their doctrine, this refers to the ministry. Christ is the
   only Teacher of the Church; but he intended that his doctrine, of which
   he had been the first Teacher, should be afterwards preached by the
   apostles.

   21. But all these things they will do to you. As the fury of the world
   is monstrous, when it is so enraged against the doctrine of its own
   salvation, Christ assigns the reason to be, that it is hurried on by
   blind ignorance to its own destruction; for no man would deliberately
   engage in battle against God. It is blindness and ignorance of God,
   therefore, that hurries on the world, so that it does not hesitate to
   make war with Christ. We ought, then, always to observe the cause of
   this conduct, and the true consolation consists in nothing else than
   the testimony of a good conscience. It should also excite gratitude in
   our minds, that, while the world perishes in its blindness, God hath
   given to us his light. Yet let it be understood that hatred of Christ
   arises from stupidity of mind, when God is not known; for, as I have
   often said, unbelief is blind; not that wicked men do not understand or
   know anything, but because all the knowledge that they have is
   confused, and quickly vanishes away. On this subject I have elsewhere
   treated more largely.

   John 15:22-27

   22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but
   now they have no excuse for their sin. 23. He who hateth me hateth my
   Father also. 24. If I had not done among them the works which no other
   man did, they would not have had sin; but now have they both seen and
   hated both me and my Father. 25. But that the word may be fulfilled
   which is written in their law. They have hated me without a cause. 26.
   But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the
   Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, will
   testify of me: 27. And you also will bear testimony, (or, are
   witnesses) because from the beginning you are with me.


   22. If I had not come. He had said that the Jews regarded the Gospel
   with hatred, because they did not know God. Lest any one should think
   that this tended to alleviate their guilt, he adds, that it is through
   malice that they are blind, just as if one were to shut his eyes, that
   he might not be compelled to see the light. For otherwise it might have
   been brought as an objection against Christ. "If they do not know thy
   Father, how comes it that thou dost not cure their ignorance? Why didst
   thou not at least make trial whether they were altogether incapable of
   being taught, or not?" He replies, that he has performed the duty of a
   good and faithful Teacher, but without success, because their malice
   would not suffer them to acquire soundness of mind. In the person of
   those men he intended to strike terror into all who reject the truth of
   God, when it is offered to them, or intentionally fight against it,
   when it is known. And though a dreadful vengeance awaits them, still
   Christ, in this passage, looks chiefly to his own disciples, to animate
   them by the confident and well-grounded expectation of victory, lest,
   at any time, they should yield to the malice of wicked men; for when we
   learn that such will be the issue, we may already triumph, as if we
   were in the midst of the battle.

   They would not have sin. It may be thought that Christ intended by
   these words to say, that there is no other sin but unbelief; and there
   are some who think so. Augustine speaks more soberly, but he approaches
   to that opinion; for, since faith forgives and blots out all sins, he
   says, that the only sin that damns a man is unbelief. This is true, for
   unbelief not only hinders men from being delivered from the
   condemnation of death, but is the source and cause of all evils. But
   the whole of that reasoning is inapplicable to the present passage; for
   the word sin is not taken in a general sense, but as related to the
   subject which is now under consideration; as if Christ had said, that
   their ignorance is utterly inexcusable, because in his person they
   maliciously rejected God; just as if we were to pronounce a person to
   be innocent, just, and pure, when we wished merely to acquit him of a
   single crime of which he had been accused. Christ's acquittal of them,
   therefore, is confined to one kind of sin, because it takes away from
   the Jews every pretense of ignorance in this sin, [87] of despising and
   hating the Gospel.

   But there is still another question that arises: "Was not unbelief
   sufficient to condemn men before the coming of Christ?" There are
   fanatics who reason inconclusively from this passage, that all who died
   before the coming of Christ died without faith, and remained in a state
   of doubt and suspense till Christ manifested himself to them; as if
   there were not many passages of Scripture which testify that their
   conscience alone was sufficient to condemn them. Death, says Paul,
   reigned in the world even to Moses, (Romans 5:14.) And again he
   declares, that

   they who have sinned without law shall perish without law,
   (Romans 2:12.)

   What, then, does Christ mean? There is undoubtedly an admission made in
   these words, by which he means that the Jews have nothing more to offer
   in extenuation of their guilt, since they knowingly and willfully
   rejected the life which was offered to them. Thus the excuse which he
   makes for them does not free them from all blame, but only extenuates
   the heinousness of their crime, according to that saying, The servant,
   who knoweth the will of his master, and despiseth it, shall be severely
   punished? [88] For it was not the intention of Christ here to promise
   pardon to any, but to hold his enemies convicted, who had obstinately
   rejected the grace of God, that it might be fully evident that they
   were unworthy of all pardon and mercy.

   If I had not come and SPOKEN TO THEM. It ought to be observed, that he
   does not speak of his coming, as viewed by itself, but as connected
   with his doctrine, for they would not have been held guilty of so great
   a crime on account of his bodily presence alone, but the contempt of
   the doctrine made them utterly inexcusable.

   23. He who hateth me hateth my Father also. This is a remarkable
   passage, which teaches us that no man can hate the doctrine of the
   Gospel without manifesting his impiety against God. There are many,
   indeed, who profess differently in words; for, though they abhor the
   Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good servants of God; but it
   is false, for a contempt of God is concealed within. In this manner
   Christ discovers the hypocrisy of many by the light of his doctrine;
   and on this subject we have spoken more largely under that passage,

   Whosoever doeth what is evil hateth the light [89] (John 3:20,)

   and under that passage,

   He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father, [90]
   (John 5:23.)

   24. If I had not done among them the works Under the word works he
   includes, in my opinion, all the proofs which he gave of his Divine
   glory; for by miracles, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, and by
   other demonstrations, he clearly proved that he was the Son of God, so
   that in him was plainly seen the majesty of the Only-begotten Son, as
   we have seen under John 1:14 [91] It is commonly objected, that he did
   not perform more miracles or greater miracles than Moses and the
   Prophets. The answer is well known, that Christ is more eminent in
   miracles in this respect, that he was not merely a minister, like the
   rest, but was strictly the Author of them; for he employed his own
   name, his own authority, and his own power, in performing miracles.
   But, as I have said, he includes in general all the testimonies of
   heavenly and spiritual power by which his Divinity was displayed.

   They have seen and hated. He concludes that his enemies cannot escape
   by any shifts to which they may have recourse, since they despised his
   power, which evidently was altogether Divine; for God had openly
   manifested his Divinity in the Son; and therefore it would serve no
   purpose for them to say that they had only to do with a mortal man.
   This passage reminds us to consider attentively the works of God, in
   which, by displaying his power, he wishes us to render the honor which
   is due to him. Hence it follows, that all who obscure the gifts of God,
   or who contemptuously overlook them, are ungrateful to God, and
   malicious.

   25. But that the word may be fulfilled. What is contrary to nature
   appears to be incredible. But nothing is more contrary to reason than
   to hate God; and, therefore, Christ says that so great was the malice
   with which their minds were envenomed, that they hated him without a
   cause Christ quotes a passage from Psalm 35:19, which, he says, is now
   fulfilled Not that the same thing did not happen, formerly, to David,
   but to reprove the obstinate malice of the nation, which reigned
   perpetually from age to age, being continued from grandfathers to
   grandchildren in unbroken succession; as if he had said, that they were
   in no respect better than their fathers, who hated David without a
   cause.

   Which is written in their Law. By the word Law, he means the Psalms;
   for the whole doctrine of the Prophets was nothing else than an
   appendage to the Law; and we know that the ministry of Moses lasted
   till the time of Christ. He calls it their Law, not as an expression of
   respect for them, but to wound them more deeply by a designation which
   was well known among them; as if he had said, "They have a Law
   transmitted to them by hereditary right, in which they see their morals
   painted to the life."

   26. But when the Comforter is come. After having explained to the
   apostles that the Gospel ought not to be less highly valued by them,
   because it has many adversaries, even within the Church itself; Christ
   now, in opposition to the wicked fury of those men, produces the
   testimony of the Spirit, and if their consciences rest on this
   testimony, they will never be shaken; as if he had said, "True, the
   world will rage against you; some will mock, and others will curse your
   doctrine; but none of their attacks will be so violent as to shake the
   firmness of your faith, when the Holy Spirit shall have been given to
   you to establish you by his testimony." And, indeed, when the world
   rages on all sides, our only protection is, that the truth of God,
   scaled by the Holy Spirit on our hearts, despises and defies all that
   is in the world; for, if it were subject to the opinions of men, our
   faith would be overwhelmed a hundred times in a day.

   We ought, therefore, to observe carefully in what manner we ought to
   remain firm among so many storms. It is because

   we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
   of God, that we may know the things which have been given to us by God,
   (1 Corinthians 2:12.)

   This single witness powerfully drives away, scatters, and overturns,
   all that the world rears up to obscure or crush the truth of God. All
   who are endued with this Spirit are so far from being in danger of
   falling into despondency on account of the hatred or contempt of the
   world, that every one of them will obtain glorious victory over the
   whole world. Yet we must beware of relying on the good opinion of men;
   for so long as faith shall wonder in this manner, or rather, as soon as
   it shall have gone out of the sanctuary of God, it must become involved
   in miserable uncertainty. It must, therefore, be brought back to the
   inward and secret testimony of the Spirit, which, believers know, has
   been given to them from heaven.

   The Spirit is said to testify of Christ, because he retains and fixes
   our faith on him alone, that we may not seek elsewhere any part of our
   salvation. He calls him also the Comforter, that, relying on his
   protection, we may never be alarmed; for by this title Christ intended
   to fortify our faith, that it may not yield to any temptations. When he
   calls him the Spirit of truth, we must apply the term to the matter in
   hand; for we must presuppose a contrast to this effect, that, when they
   have not this Witness, men are carried about in various ways, and have
   no firm resting-place, but, wherever he speaks, he delivers the minds
   of men from all doubt and fear of being deceived.

   When he says that he will send him from the Father, and, again, that he
   proceedeth from the Father, he does so in order to increase the weight
   of his authority; for the testimony of the Spirit would not be
   sufficient against attacks so powerful, and against efforts so numerous
   and fierce, if we were not convinced that he proceedeth from God So
   then it is Christ who sends the Spirit, but it is from the heavenly
   glory, that we may know that it is not a gift of men, but a sure pledge
   of Divine grace. Hence it appears how idle was the subtlety of the
   Greeks, when they argued, on the ground of these words, that the Spirit
   does not proceed from the Son; for here Christ, according to his
   custom, mentions the Father in order to raise our eyes to the
   contemplation of his Divinity.

   27. And you also bear testimony. Christ means that the testimony of the
   Spirit will not be of such a nature that the apostles shall have it for
   their private advantage, or that they alone shall enjoy it, but that by
   them it will be widely diffused, because they will be organs of the
   Holy Spirit, as indeed, he spoke by their mouth. We now see in what way
   faith is by hearing, (Romans 10:17,) and yet it derives its certainty
   from the seal and earnest of the Spirit, (Ephesians 1:13, 14.) Those
   who do not sufficiently know the darkness of the human mind imagine
   that faith is formed naturally by hearing and preaching alone; [92] and
   there are many fanatics who disdain the outward preaching, and talk in
   lofty terms about secret revelations and inspirations, (enthousiasmous)
   But we see how Christ joins these two things together; and, therefore,
   though there is no faith till the Spirit of God seal our minds and
   hearts, still we must not go to seek visions or oracles in the clouds;
   but the word,

   which is near us, in our mouth and heart,
   (Romans 10:8,)

   must keep all our senses bound and fixed on itself, as Isaiah says
   beautifully:

   My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
   mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
   seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the Lord, from
   henceforth and for ever,
   (Isaiah 59:21.)

   Because you are with me from the beginning. This clause was added in
   order to inform us that so much the greater credit is due to the
   apostles on this ground, that they were eye-witnesses of what they
   relate; as John says,

   what we have heard, what we have seen,
   what our hands have handled, we declare to you;
   (1 John 1:1)

   for thus the Lord intended to provide for our welfare in every possible
   way, that nothing might be wanting for a full confirmation of the
   Gospel.

   CHAPTER 16
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 16:1-7

   1. These things I have spoken to you, that you may not be offended. 2.
   They will drive you out of the synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that
   whosoever shall kill you will think that he offereth service to God. 3.
   And they will do these things to you, because they have not known the
   Father, nor me. 4. But these things I have spoken to you, that, when
   the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And I
   told you not these things at the beginning, because I was with you. 5.
   And now I go to him who sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither
   goest thou? 6. But because I have told you these things, sorrow hath
   filled your hearts. 7. But I tell you the truth; It is expedient for
   you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come
   to you; but shall go away, I will send him to you.


   1. These things I have spoken to you. He again states that none of
   those things which he has spoken are superfluous; for, since wars and
   contests await them, it is necessary that they should be provided
   beforehand with the necessary arms. Yet he also means that, if they
   meditate deeply on this doctrine, they will be fully prepared for
   resistance. Let us remember that what he then said to the disciples is
   also spoken to us. And, first, we ought to understand that Christ does
   not send his followers into the field unarmed, and, therefore, that, if
   any man fail in this warfare, his own indolence alone is to blame. And
   yet we ought not to wait till the struggle be actually commenced, but
   ought rather to endeavor to become well acquainted with these
   discourses of Christ, and to render them familiar to our minds, so that
   we may march into the field of battle, as soon as it is necessary; for
   we must not doubt that the victory is in our hands, so long as those
   admonitions of Christ shall be deeply imprinted on our minds. For, when
   he says THAT YOU MAY NOT be offended, he means that there is no danger,
   lest anything turn us aside from the right course. But how few there
   are that learn this doctrine in a proper manner, is evident from this
   fact, that they who think that they know it by heart when they are
   beyond arrow-shot, are no sooner obliged to enter into actual combat
   than they give way, as if they were utterly ignorant, and had never
   received any instruction. [93] Let us, therefore accustom ourselves to
   use this armor in such a manner that it may never drop out of our
   hands.

   2. They will drive you out of the synagogues. This was no light offense
   to disturb their minds, that they were to be banished like wicked men
   from the assembly of the godly, or, at least, of those who boasted that
   they were the people of God, and gloried in the title of The Church;
   for believers are subject not only to persecutions, but to ignominy and
   reproaches, as Paul tells us, (1 Corinthians 4:12, 18.) But Christ bids
   them stand firm against this attack; because, though they be banished
   from the synagogues, still they remain within the kingdom of God. His
   statement amounts to this, that we ought not to be dismayed by the
   perverse judgments of men, but ought to endure boldly the reproach of
   the cross of Christ, satisfied with this single consideration, that our
   cause which men unjustly and wickedly condemn, is approved by God.

   Hence too we infer, that the ministers of the Gospel not only are ill
   treated by the avowed enemies of the faith, but sometimes also endure
   the greatest reproaches from those who appear to belong to the Church,
   and who are even regarded as its pillars. The scribes and priests, by
   whom the apostles were condemned, boasted that they were appointed by
   God to be judges of the Church; and, indeed, the ordinary government of
   the Church was in their hands, and the office of judging was from God,
   and not from men. But by their tyranny, they had corrupted the whole of
   that order which God had appointed. The consequence was, that the power
   which had been given to them for edification, was nothing else than a
   cruel oppression of the servants of God; and excommunication, which
   ought to have been a medicine for purifying the Church, was turned to
   an opposite purpose, for driving away from it the fear of God.

   Since the apostles knew this by experience, in their own age, we have
   no reason to be greatly alarmed at the Pope's excommunications, with
   which he thunders against us on account of the testimony of the Gospel;
   for we ought not to fear that they will do us any more injury than
   those ancient excommunications which were made against the apostles.
   Nay more, nothing is more desirable than to be driven out of that
   assembly from which Christ is banished. Yet let us observe that, though
   the abuse of excommunication was so gross, still it did not effect the
   destruction of that discipline which God had appointed in his Church
   from the beginning; for, though Satan devotes his utmost efforts to
   corrupt all the ordinances of God, we must not yield to him, so as to
   take away, on account of corruptions, what God has appointed to be
   perpetual. Excommunication, therefore, not less than Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper, must be brought back, by the correction of abuses, to
   its pure and lawful use.

   But the hour cometh. Christ dwells still more largely on this offense,
   that the enemies of the Gospel lay claim to so much authority, that
   they think they are offering sacrifices to God where they slay
   believers. It is sufficiently hard in itself, that innocent people
   should be cruelly tormented, but it is far more grievous and
   distressing that those outrages, which wicked men commit against the
   children of God, should be reckoned punishments justly due to them on
   account of their crimes. But we ought to be so fully assured of the
   protection of a good conscience, as to endure patiently to be oppressed
   for a time, till Christ appear from heaven, to defend his cause and
   ours.

   It may be thought strange, however, that the enemies of the truth,
   though they are conscious of their own wickedness, not only impose on
   men, but even in the presence of God lay claim to praise for their
   unjust cruelty. I reply, hypocrites, though their conscience accuses
   them, always resort to flatteries to deceive themselves. They are
   ambitious, cruel, and proud, but they cover all these vices with the
   cloak of zeal, that they may indulge in them without restraint. To this
   is added what may be called a furious drunkenness, after having tasted
   the blood of martyrs.

   3. And they will do these things. Not without good reason does Christ
   frequently remind the apostles of this consideration, that there is
   only one reason why unbelievers are so greatly enraged against them. It
   is, because they do not know God. And yet this is not said for the
   purpose of extenuating their guilt, but that the apostles may boldly
   despise their blind fury; for it often happens that the authority which
   wicked men possess, and the luster which shines in them, shake modest
   and pious minds. But Christ, on the other hand, enjoins his followers
   to rise with holy magnanimity, to despise their adversaries, who are
   impelled by nothing else than error and blindness; for this is our wall
   of brass, when we are fully persuaded that God is on our side, and that
   they who oppose us are destitute of reason. Again, these words remind
   us, what a serious evil it is not to know God, since it leads even
   those who have murdered their own parents to expect praise and
   approbation for their wickedness.

   4. That when the hour cometh, you may remember. He repeats what he had
   already said, that this is not a philosophy fitted only for a season of
   leisure, but that it is adapted to practice and use, and that he now
   discourses on these matters, that they may actually demonstrate that
   they have not been taught in vain. When he says, that you may remember,
   he enjoins them, first, to lay up in their minds what they have heard;
   secondly, to remember them, when they shall be required to put them in
   practice; and, lastly, he declares that no small importance attaches to
   the fact, that he utters predictions of future events.

   And I told you not these things at the beginning. As the apostles were
   still weak and tender, so long as Christ conversed with them in the
   flesh, their singularly good and indulgent Master spared them, and did
   not suffer them to be urged beyond what they were able to bear. At that
   time, therefore, they had no great need of confirmation, while they
   enjoyed leisure and freedom from persecution; but now he tells them
   that they must change their mode of life, and as a new condition awaits
   them, he likewise exhorts them to prepare for a conflict.

   5. And now I go to him who sent me. By a very excellent consolation he
   assuages the grief which they might feel on account of his departure,
   and this was highly necessary. They who had hitherto been allowed to
   remain at their ease, were called to severe and arduous battles for the
   future. What then, would have become of them, if they had not known
   that Christ was in heaven, as the guardian of their salvation? For to
   go to the Father is nothing else than to be received into the heavenly
   glory, in order to possess the highest authority. This is held out to
   them, therefore, as a solace and remedy of grief, that, though Christ
   be absent from them in body, yet he will sit at the right hand of the
   Father, to protect believers by his power.

   Here Christ reproves the apostles for two faults; first, that they were
   too much attached to the visible presence of his flesh; and, secondly,
   that, when this had been taken away, they were seized with grief, and
   did not lift their eyes to a higher region. The same thing happens to
   us; for we always hold Christ bound by our senses, and then, if he do
   not appear to us according: to our desire, we contrive for ourselves a
   ground of despair.

   And none of you asketh me, whither goest thou? It may appear to be an
   unfounded charge against the apostles, that they did not ask whether
   their Master was going; for they had formerly inquired at him on this
   subject with great earnestness. But the answer is easy. When they
   inquired, they did not raise their minds to confidence, and this was
   the chief duty which they were bound to perform. The meaning therefore
   is, as soon as you hear of my departure, you become alarmed, and do not
   consider whither I am going, or for what purpose I go away."

   7. Yet I tell you the truth. That they may no longer wish to have him
   present before their eyes, he testifies that his absence will be
   advantageous, and makes use of a sort of oath; for we are carnal, and
   consequently nothing is more difficult than to tear from our minds this
   foolish inclination, by which we attempt to draw down Christ from
   heaven to us. He explains where the advantage lies, by saying that the
   Holy Spirit could not be given to them, if he did not leave the world.
   But far more advantageous and far more desirable is that presence of
   Christ, by which he communicates himself to us through the grace and
   power of his Spirit, than if he were present before our eyes. And here
   we must not put the question, "Could not Christ have drawn down the
   Holy Spirit while he dwelt on earth?" For Christ takes for granted all
   that had been decreed by the Father and, indeed, when the Lord has once
   pointed out what he wishes to be done, to dispute about what is
   possible would be foolish and pernicious.

   John 16:8-15

   8. And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and of judgment 9. Of sin, because they believe not in
   me 10. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no
   more. 11. Of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been
   judged. 12. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear
   them now. 13. But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will lead
   you into all truth; for he will not speak from himself, but will speak
   all that he has heard, and will declare to you the things that are to
   come. 14. He will glorify me, for he will take of what is mine, and
   will declare it to you. 15. All things that the Father hath are mine;
   therefore I said to you, He will take of what is mine, and will declare
   it to you.


   8. And when he is come. Passing by the diversity of expositions, which
   we have received in consequence of the obscurity of the passage, I
   shall only state what appears to me to be in accordance with Christ's
   true meaning. He had promised his Spirit to the disciples; and now he
   praises the excellence of the gift from its effect, because this Spirit
   will not only guide, support, and protect them in private, but will
   extend more widely his power and efficacy.

   He will convince the world; that is, he will not remain shut up in you,
   but; his power will go forth from you to be displayed to the whole
   world. He therefore promises to them a Spirit, who will be the Judge of
   the world, and by whom their preaching will be so powerful and
   efficacious, that it will bring into subjection those who formerly
   indulged in unbounded licentiousness, and were restrained by no fear or
   reverence.

   It ought to be observed, that in this passage Christ does not speak of
   secret revelations, but of the power of the Spirit, which appears in
   the outward doctrine of the Gospel, and in the voice of men. For how
   comes it that the voice proceeding from the mouth of a man [94]
   penetrates into the hearts, takes root there, and at length yields
   fruit, changing hearts of stone into hearts of flesh, and renewing men,
   but because the Spirit of Christ quickens it? Otherwise it would be a
   dead letter and a useless sound, as Paul says in that beautiful
   passage, in which he boasts of being a minister of the Spirit, (2
   Corinthians 3:6,) because God wrought powerfully in his doctrine. The
   meaning therefore is, that, though the Spirit had been given to the
   apostles, they would be endued with a heavenly and Divine power, by
   which they would exercise jurisdiction over the whole world. Now, this
   is ascribed to the Spirit rather than to themselves, because they will
   have no power of their own, but will be only ministers and organs, and
   the Holy Spirit will be their director and governor. [95]

   Under the term world are, I think, included not only those who would be
   truly converted to Christ, but hypocrites and reprobates. For there are
   two ways in which the Spirit convinces men by the preaching of the
   Gospel. Some are moved in good earnest, so as to bow down willingly,
   and to assent willingly to the judgment by which they are condemned.
   Others, though they are convinced of guilt and cannot escape, yet do
   not sincerely yield, or submit themselves to the authority and
   jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit, but, on the contrary, being subdued
   they groan inwardly, and, being overwhelmed with confusion, still do
   not cease to cherish obstinacy within their hearts.

   We now perceive in what manner the Spirit was to convince the world by
   the apostles. It was, because God revealed his judgment in the Gospel,
   by which their consciences were struck, and began to perceive their
   evils and the grace of God. for the verb elenchein here signifies to
   convince or convict; and, for understanding this passage, not a little
   light will be obtained from the words of the Apostle Paul, when he
   says,

   If all shall prophesy, and an unbeliever or unlearned man enter, he is
   convicted by all, he is judged by all, and thus shall the secrets of
   his heart be made manifest,
   (1 Corinthians 14:23.)

   In that passage Paul speaks particularly of one kind of conviction,
   that is; when the Lord brings his elect to repentance by the Gospel;
   but this plainly shows in what manner the Spirit of God, by the sound
   of the human voice, constrains men, who formerly were not accustomed to
   his yoke, to acknowledge and submit to his authority.

   A question now arises, For what purpose did Christ say this? Some think
   that he points out the cause of the hatred which he had mentioned; as
   if he had said, that the reason why they will be hated by the world is,
   that the Spirit, on the other hand, will earnestly solicit the world by
   means of them. But I rather agree with those who tell us that the
   design of Christ was different, as I stated briefly at the commencement
   of the exposition of this verse; for it was of great importance that
   the apostles should know that the gift of the Spirit, which had been
   promised to them, was of no ordinary value. He therefore describes its
   uncommon excellence, by saying that God will, in this way, erect his
   tribunal for judging the whole world.

   9. Of sin. It now remains that we see what it is to convince of sin
   Christ appears to make unbelief the only cause of sin, and this is
   tortured by commentators in various ways; but, as I have already said,
   I do not intend to detail the opinions which have been held and
   advanced. First, it ought to be observed, that the judgment of the
   Spirit commences with the demonstration of sin; for the commencement of
   spiritual instruction is, that men born in sin have nothing in them but
   what leads to sin Again, Christ mentioned unbelief, in order to show
   what is the nature of men in itself for, since faith is the bond by
   which he is united to us, until we believe in him, we are out of him
   and separated from him. The import of these words is as if he had said,
   "When the Spirit is come, he will produce full conviction that, apart
   from me, sin reigns in the world;" and, therefore, unbelief is here
   mentioned, because it separates us from Christ, in consequence of which
   nothing is left to us but sin In short, by these words he condemns the
   corruption and depravity of human nature, that we may not suppose that
   a single drop of integrity is in us without Christ.

   10. Of righteousness. We must attend to the succession of steps which
   Christ lays down. He now says that the world must be convinced of
   righteousness; for men will never hunger and thirst for righteousness,
   but, on the contrary, will disdainfully reject all that is said
   concerning it, if they have not been moved by a conviction of sin As to
   believers particularly, we ought to understand that they cannot make
   progress in the Gospel till they have first been humbled; and this
   cannot take place, till they have acknowledged their sins. It is
   undoubtedly the peculiar office of the Law to summon consciences to the
   judgment-seat of God, and to strike them with terror; but the Gospel
   cannot be preached in a proper manner, till it lead men from sin to
   righteousness, and from death to life; and, therefore, it is necessary
   to borrow from the Law that first clause of which Christ spoke.

   By righteousness must here be understood that which is imparted to us
   through the grace of Christ. Christ makes it to consist in his
   ascension to the Father, and not without good reason; for, as Paul
   declares that he rose for our justification, (Romans 4:25) so he now
   sits at the right hand of the Father in such a manner as to exercise
   all the authority that has been given to him, and thus to fill all
   things, (Ephesians 4:10.) In short, from the heavenly glory he fills
   the world with the sweet savor of his righteousness Now the Spirit
   declares, by the Gospel, that this is the only way in which we are
   accounted righteous Next to the conviction of sin, this is the second
   step, that the Spirit should convince the world what true righteousness
   is, namely, that Christ, by his ascension to heaven, has established
   the kingdom of life, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, to
   confirm true righteousness

   11. Of judgment. Those who understand the word (kriseos) judgment as
   signifying condemnation, have some argument on their side; for Christ
   immediately adds, that the prince of this world hath been judged But I
   prefer a different opinion, namely, that, the light of the Gospel
   having been kindled, the Spirit manifests that the world has been
   brought into a state of good order by the victory of Christ, by which
   he overturned the authority of Satan; as if he had said, that this is a
   true restoration, by which all things are reformed, when Christ alone
   holds the kingdom, having subdued and triumphed over Satan. Judgment,
   therefore, is contrasted with what is confused and disordered, or, to
   express it briefly, it is the opposite (tos ataxias) of confusion, or,
   we might call it righteousness, a sense which it often bears in
   Scripture. The meaning therefore is, that Satan, so long as he retains
   the government, perplexes and disturbs all things, so that there is an
   unseemly and disgraceful confusion in the works of God; but when he is
   stripped of his tyranny by Christ, then the world is restored, and good
   order is seen to reign. Thus the Spirit convinces the world of
   judgment; that is, having vanquished the prince of wickedness, Christ
   restores to order those things which formerly were torn and decayed.

   12. I have still many things to say to you. Christ's discourse could
   not have so much influence over his disciples, as to prevent their
   ignorance from still keeping them in perplexity about many things; and
   not only so, but they scarcely obtained a slight taste of those things
   which ought to have imparted to them full satisfaction, had it not been
   for the obstruction arising from the weakness of the flesh. It was,
   therefore, impossible but that the consciousness of their poverty
   should oppress them with fear and anxiety. But Christ meets it by this
   consolation, that, when they have received the Spirit, they will be new
   men, and altogether different from what they were before.

   But you are not able to bear them now. When he says that, were he to
   tell them anything more, or what was loftier, they would not be able to
   bear it, his object is to encourage them by the hope of better
   progress, that they may not lose courage; for the grace which he was to
   bestow on them ought not to be estimated by their present feelings,
   since they were at so great a distance from heaven. In short, he bids
   them be cheerful and courageous, whatever may be their present
   weakness. But as there was nothing else than doctrine on which they
   could rely, Christ reminds them that he had accommodated it to their
   capacity, yet so as to lead them to expect that they would soon
   afterwards obtain loftier and more abundant instruction; as if he had
   said, "If what you have heard from me is not yet sufficient to confirm
   you, have patience for a little; for ere long, having enjoyed the
   teaching of the Spirit, you will need nothing more; he will remove all
   the ignorance that now remains in you."

   Now arises a question, what were those things which the apostles were
   not yet able to learn? The Papists, for the purpose of putting forward
   their inventions as the oracles of God, wickedly abuse this passage.
   "Christ," they tell us, "promised to the apostles new revelations; and,
   therefore, we must not abide solely by Scripture, for something beyond
   Scripture is here promised by him to his followers." In the first
   place, if they choose to talk with Augustine, the solution will be
   easily obtained. His words are, "Since Christ is silent, which of us
   shall say that it was this or that? Or, if he shall venture to say so,
   how shall he prove it? Who is so rash and insolent, even though he say
   what is true, as to affirm, without any Divine testimony, that those
   are the things which the Lord at that time did not choose to say?" But
   we have a surer way of refuting them, taken from Christ's own words,
   which follow.

   13. But when he is come, the Spirit of truth. The Spirit, whom Christ
   promised to the apostles, is declared to be perfect Master or Teacher
   [96] of truth And why was he promised, but that they might deliver from
   hand to hand the wisdom which they had received from him? The Spirit
   was given to them, and under his guidance and direction they discharged
   the office to which they had been appointed.

   He will lead you into all truth. That very Spirit had lead them into
   all truth, when they committed to writing the substance of their
   doctrine. Whoever imagines that anything must be added to their
   doctrine, as if it were imperfect and but half-finished, not only
   accuses the apostles of dishonesty, but blasphemes against the Spirit
   If the doctrine which they committed to writing had proceeded from mere
   learners or persons imperfectly taught, an addition to it would not
   have been superfluous; but now that their writings may be regarded as
   perpetual records of that revelation which was promised and given to
   them, nothing can be added to them without doing grievous injury to the
   Holy Spirit.

   When they come to determine what those things actually were, the
   Papists act a highly ridiculous part, for they define those mysteries,
   which the apostles were unable to bear, to be certain childish
   fooleries, the most absurd and stupid things that can be imagined. Was
   it necessary that the Spirit should come down from heaven that the
   apostles might learn what ceremony must be used in consecrating cups
   with their altars, in baptizing church-bells, in blessing the holy
   water, and in celebrating Mass? Whence then do fools and children
   obtain their learning, who understand all those matters most
   thoroughly? Nothing is more evident than that the Papists mock God,
   when they pretend that those things came from heaven, which resemble as
   much the mysteries of Ceres or Proserpine as they are at variance with
   the pure wisdom of the Holy Spirit.

   If we do not wish to be ungrateful to God, let us rest satisfied with
   that doctrine of which the writings of the apostles declare them to be
   the authors, since in it the highest perfection of heavenly wisdom is
   made known to us, fitted to make the man of God perfect (2 Timothy
   3:17.) Beyond this let us not reckon ourselves at liberty to go; for
   our height, and breadth, and depth, consist in knowing the love of God,
   which is manifested to us in Christ. This knowledge, as Paul informs
   us, far exceeds all learning, (Ephesians 3:18;) and when he declares
   that

   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ,
   (Colossians 2:3,)

   he does not contrive some unknown Christ, but one whom by his preaching
   he painted to the life, so that, as he tells the Galatians,

   we see him, as it were, crucified before our eyes,
   (Galatians 3:1.)

   But that no ambiguity may remain, Christ himself afterwards explains by
   his own words what those things are which the apostles were not yet
   able to bear.

   He will tell you things which are to come Some indeed limit this to the
   Spirit of prophecy; but, in my opinion, it denotes rather the future
   condition of his spiritual kingdom, such as the apostles, soon after
   his resurrection, saw it to be, but were at that time utterly unable to
   comprehend. He does not therefore promise them prophecies of things
   that would happen after their death, but means only that the nature of
   his kingdom will be widely different, and its glory far greater than
   their minds are now able to conceive. The Apostle Paul, in the Epistle
   to the Ephesians, from the first chapter to the close of the fourth,
   explains the treasures of this hidden wisdom, which the heavenly angels
   learn with astonishment from the Church; and therefore we need not go
   to seek them from the archives or repositories of the Pope.

   For he will not speak from himself This is a confirmation of the
   clause, He will lead you into all truth. We know that God is the
   fountain of truth, and that out of Him there is nothing that is firm or
   sure; and, therefore, that the apostles may safely place full
   confidence in the oracles of the Spirit, Christ declares that they will
   be divine oracles; as if he had said, that every thing which the Holy
   Spirit shall bring proceeds from God himself. And yet these words take
   nothing away from the majesty of the Spirit, as if he were not God, or
   as if he were inferior to the Father, but are accommodated to the
   capacity of our understanding; for the reason why his Divinity is
   expressly mentioned is, because, on account of the veil that is between
   us, we do not sufficiently understand with what reverence we ought to
   receive what the Spirit reveals to us. In like manner, he is elsewhere
   called the earnest, by which God ratifies to us our salvation, and the
   seal, by which he seals to us its certainty, (Ephesians 1:13, 14.) In
   short, Christ intended to teach that the doctrine of the Spirit would
   not be of this world, as if it were produced in the air, but that it
   would proceed from the secret places of the heavenly sanctuary.

   14. He will glorify me Christ now reminds them that the Spirit will not
   come to erect any new kingdom, but rather to confirm the glory which
   has been given to him by the Father. For many foolishly imagine that
   Christ taught only so as to lay down the first lessons, and then to
   send the disciples to a higher school. In this way they make the Gospel
   to be of no greater value than the Law, of which it is said that it was
   a schoolmaster of the ancient people, (Galatians 3:24.)

   This error is followed by another equally intolerable, that, having bid
   adieu to Christ, as if his reign were terminated, and he were now
   nothing at all, they substitute the Spirit in his place. From this
   source the sacrileges of Popery and Mahometanism have flowed; for,
   though those two Antichrists differ from each other in many respects,
   still they agree in holding a common principle; and that is, that in
   the Gospel we receive the earliest instructions to lead us into the
   right faith, [97] but that we must seek elsewhere the perfection of
   doctrine, that it may complete the course of our education. If
   Scripture is quoted against the Pope, he maintains that we ought not to
   confine ourselves to it, because the Spirit is come, and has carried us
   above Scripture by many additions. Mahomet asserts that, without his
   Alcoran, men always re-main children. Thus, by a false pretense of the
   Spirit, the world was bewitched to depart from the simple purity of
   Christ; for, as soon as the Spirit is separated from the word of
   Christ, the door is open to all kinds of delusions and impostures. A
   similar method of deceiving has been attempted, in the present age, by
   many fanatics. The written doctrine appeared to them to be literal,
   and, therefore, they chose to contrive a new theology that would
   consist of revelations.

   We now see that the information given by Christ, that he would be
   glorified by the Spirit whom he should send, is far from being
   superfluous; for it was intended to inform us, that the office of the
   Holy Spirit was nothing else than to establish the kingdom of Christ,
   and to maintain and confirm for ever all that was given him by the
   Father. Why then does he speak of the Spirit's teaching? Not to
   withdraw us from the school of Christ, but rather to ratify that word
   by which we are commanded to listen to him, otherwise he would diminish
   the glory of Christ. The reason is added, Christ says,

   For he will take of what is mine. By these words he means that we
   receive the Spirit in order that we may enjoy Christ's blessings. For
   what does he bestow on us? That we may be washed by the blood of
   Christ, that sin may be blotted out in us by his death, that our old
   man may be crucified, (Romans 6:6,) that his resurrection may be
   efficacious in forming us again to newness of life, (Romans 6:4;) and,
   in short, that we may become partakers of his benefits. Nothing,
   therefore, is bestowed on us by the Spirit apart from Christ, but he
   takes it from Christ, that he may communicate it to us. We ought to
   take the same view of his doctrine; for he does not enlighten us, in
   order to draw us away in the smallest degree from Christ, but to
   fulfill what Paul says, that Christ is made to us wisdom, (1
   Corinthians 1:30,) and likewise to display those treasures which are
   hidden in Christ, (Colossians 2:3.) In a word, the Spirit enriches us
   with no other than the riches of Christ, that he may display his glory
   in all things.

   15. All things that the Father hath are mine. As it might be thought
   that Christ took away from the Father what he claimed for himself, he
   acknowledges that he has received from the Father all that he
   communicates to us by the Spirit. When he says that all things that the
   Father hath are his, he speaks in the person of the Mediator, for we
   must draw out of his fullness, (John 1:16.) He always keeps his eye on
   us, as we have said. We see, on the other hand, how the greater part of
   men deceive themselves; for they pass by Christ, and go out of the way
   to seek God by circuitous paths.

   Other commentators explain these words to mean, that all that the
   Father hath belongs equally to the Son, because he is the same God. But
   here he does not speak of his hidden and intrinsic power, as it is
   called, but of that office which he has been appointed to exercise
   toward us. In short, he speaks of his riches, that he may invite us to
   enjoy them, and reckons the Spirit among the gifts which we receive
   from the father by his hand.

   John 16:16-20

   16. A little while, and you do not see me [98] and again a little
   while, and you will see me; because I go to the Father. 17. Then said
   some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith to
   us, a little while, and you do not see me and again a little while, and
   you will see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 18. They said,
   therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what
   he saith. 19. Jesus, therefore. knew that they wished to ask him, and
   he said to them, You ask among yourselves about what I said, A little
   while, and you do not see me: and again a little while, and you will
   see me. 20. Verily, verily, I tell you, That you will weep and lament,
   but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow
   will be turned into joy.


   16. A little while, and you do not see me. Christ had often forewarned
   the apostles of his departure, partly that they might bear it with
   greater courage, partly that they might desire more ardently the grace
   of the Spirit, of which they had no great desire, so long as they had
   Christ present with them in body. We must, therefore, guard against
   becoming weary of reading what Christ, not without cause, repeats so
   frequently. First, he says that he will very soon be taken from them,
   that, when they are deprived of his presence, on which alone they
   relied, they may continue to be firm. Next, he promises what will,
   compensate them for his absence, and he even testifies that he will
   quickly be restored to them, after he has been removed, but in another
   manner, that is, by the presence of the Holy Spirit.

   And again a little while, and you will see me. Yet some explain this
   second clause differently: You will see, me when I shall have risen
   from the dead, but only for a short time; for I shall very soon be
   received into heaven." But I do not think that the words will bear that
   meaning. On the contrary, he mitigates and soothes their sorrow for his
   absence, by this consolation, that it will not last long; and thus he
   magnifies the grace of the Spirit, by which he will be continually
   present with them; as if he had promised that, after a short interval,
   he would return, and that they would not be long deprived of his
   presence.

   Nor ought we to think it strange when he says that he is seen, when he
   dwells in the disciples by the Spirit; for, though he is not seen with
   the bodily eyes, [99] yet his presence is known by the undoubted
   experience of faith. What we are taught by Paul is indeed true, that
   believers,

   so long as they remain on earth, are absent from the Lord, because they
   walk, by faith, and not by sight,
   (2 Corinthians 5:6, 7.)

   But it is equally true that they may justly, in the meantime, glory in
   having Christ dwelling in them by faith, in being united to him as
   members to the Head, in possessing heaven along with him by hope. Thus
   the grace of the Spirit is a mirror, in which Christ wishes to be seen
   by us, according to the words of Paul,

   Though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet we know him no
   more; if any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature,
   (2 Corinthians 5:16, 17)

   Because I go to the Father. Some explain these words as meaning that
   Christ will no longer be seen by the disciples, because he will be in
   heaven, and they on earth. For my part, I would rather refer it to the
   second clause, You will soon see me; for my death is not a destruction
   to separate me from you, but a passage into the heavenly glory, from
   which my divine power will diffuse itself even to you." He intended,
   therefore, in my opinion, to teach what would be his condition after
   his death, that they might rest satisfied with his spiritual presence,
   and might not think that it would be any loss to them that he no longer
   dwelt with them as a mortal man.

   19. Jesus, therefore, knew that they wished to ask him. Though
   sometimes the Lord appears to speak to the deaf, he, at length, cures
   the ignorance of his disciples, that his instruction may not be
   useless. Our duty is to endeavor that our slowness of apprehension may
   not be accompanied by either pride or indolence, but that, on the
   contrary, we show ourselves to be humble and desirous to learn.

   20. You will weep and lament. He shows for what reason he foretold that
   his departure was at hand, and, at the same time, added a promise about
   his speedy return. It was, that they might understand better that the
   aid of the Spirit was highly necessary. "A hard and severe temptation,"
   says he, "awaits you; for, when I shall be removed from you by death,
   the world will proclaim its triumphs over you. You will feel the
   deepest anguish. The world will pronounce itself to be happy, and you
   to be miserable. I have resolved, therefore, to furnish you with the
   necessary arms for this warfare." He describes the interval that
   elapsed between his death and the day when the Holy Spirit was sent;
   [100] for at that time their faith, so to speak, lay prostrate and
   exhausted.

   Your sorrow will be turned into joy. He means the joy which they felt
   after having received the Spirit; not that they were afterwards free
   from all sorrow, but that all the sorrow which they would endure was,
   swallowed up by spiritual joy We know that the apostles: so long as
   they lived, sustained a severe warfare, that they endured base
   reproaches, that they had many reasons for weeping and lamenting; but,
   renewed by the Spirit, they had laid aside their former consciousness
   of weakness, so that, with lofty heroism, they nobly trampled under
   foot all the evils that they endured. Here then is a comparison between
   their present weakness and the power of the Spirit, which would soon be
   given to them; for, though they were nearly overwhelmed for a time, yet
   afterwards they not only fought bravely, but obtained a glorious
   triumph in the midst of their struggles. Yet it ought also to be
   observed, that he points out not only the interval that elapsed between
   the resurrection of Christ and the death of the apostles, but also the
   period which followed afterwards; as if Christ had said, "You will lie
   prostrate, as it were, for a short time; but when the Holy Spirit shall
   have raised you up again, then will begin a new joy, which will
   continue to increase, until, having been received into the heavenly
   glory, you shall have perfect joy."

   John 16:21-24

   21. A woman, when she is in labor, hath sorrow, because her hour is
   come; but when she hath brought forth a child, she remembereth no more
   her anguish, on account of the joy that a man is born into the world.
   22. And you therefore have sorrow now; but I will see you again, and
   your heart will rejoice, and your joy no man shall take from you. 23.
   And in that day you will ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I tell you,
   That whatever you shall ask from the Father in my name, he will give to
   you. 24. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name: ask, and receive,
   that your joy may be full.


   21. A woman, when she is in labor. He employs a comparison to confirm
   the statement which he had just now made, or rather, he expresses his
   meaning more clearly, that not only will their sorrow be turned into
   joy, but also that it contains in itself the ground and occasion of joy
   It frequently happens that, when adversity has been followed by
   prosperity, men forget their former grief, and give themselves up
   unreservedly to joy, and yet the grief which came before it is not the
   cause of the joy But Christ means that the sorrow which they shall
   endure for the sake of the Gospel will be profitable. Indeed, the
   result of all griefs cannot be otherwise than unfavorable, unless when
   they are blessed in Christ. But as the cross of Christ always contains
   in itself the victory, Christ justly compares the grief arising from it
   to the sorrow of a woman in labor, which receives its reward when the
   mother is cheered by the birth of the child. The comparison would not
   apply, if sorrow did not produce joy in the members of Christ, when
   they become partakers of his sufferings, just as the labor in the,
   woman is the cause of the birth. The comparison must also be applied in
   this respect, that though the sorrow of the woman is very severe, it
   quickly passes away. It was no small solace to the apostles, therefore,
   when they learned that their sorrow would not be of long duration.

   We ought now to appropriate the use of this doctrine to ourselves.
   Having been regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, we ought to feel in
   ourselves such a joy as would remove every feeling of our distresses.
   We ought, I say, to resemble women in labor, on whom the mere sight of
   the child born produces such an impression, that their pain gives them
   pain no longer. But as we have received nothing more than the
   first-fruits, and these in very small measure, we scarcely taste a few
   drops of that spiritual gladness, to soothe our grief and alleviate its
   bitterness. And yet that small portion clearly shows that they who
   contemplate Christ by faith are so far from being at any time
   overwhelmed by grief, that, amidst their heaviest sufferings, they
   rejoice with exceeding great joy.

   But since it is an obligation laid

   on all creatures to labor till the last day of redemption,
   (Romans 8:22, 23,)

   let us know that we too must groan, until, having been delivered from
   the incessant afflictions of the present life, we obtain a full view of
   the fruit of our faith. To sum up the whole in a few words, believers
   are like women in labor, because, having been born again in Christ,
   they have not yet entered into the heavenly kingdom of God and a
   blessed life; and they are like pregnant women who are in childbirth,
   because, being still held captive in the prison of the flesh, they long
   for that blessed state which lies hidden under hope.

   22. Your joy no man shall take from you. The value of the joy is
   greatly enhanced by its perpetuity; for it follows that the afflictions
   are light, and ought to be patiently endured, because they are of short
   duration. By these words Christ reminds us what is the nature of true
   joy The world must unavoidably be soon deprived of its joys, which it
   seeks only in fading things; and, therefore, we must come to the
   resurrection of Christ, in which there is eternal solidity.

   But I will see you again. When he says that he will see his disciples,
   he means that he will visit them again by the grace of his Spirit, that
   they may continually enjoy his presence.

   23. And in that day you will ask me nothing. After having promised to
   the disciples that they would derive joy from their unshaken firmness
   and courage, he now speaks of another grace of the Spirit which would
   be given to them, that they would receive so great light of
   understanding as would raise them on high to heavenly mysteries. They
   were at that time so slow that the slightest difficulty of any kind
   made them hesitate; for as children who are learning the alphabet
   cannot read a single verse without pausing frequently, so almost every
   word of Christ gave them some sort of offense, and this hindered their
   progress. But soon afterwards, having been enlightened by the Holy
   Spirit, they no longer had any thing to prevent them from becoming
   familiarly acquainted with the wisdom of God, so as to move amidst the
   mysteries of God without stumbling.

   True, the apostles did not cease to ask at the mouth of Christ, even
   when they had been elevated to the highest degree of wisdom, but this
   is only a comparison between the two conditions; as if Christ had said
   that their ignorance would be corrected, so that, instead of being
   stopped -- as they now were -- by the smallest obstructions, they would
   penetrate into the deepest mysteries without any difficulty. Such is
   the import of that passage in Jeremiah,

   No longer shall every man teach his neighbor, saying, Know the Lord for
   all shall know me, from the least to the greatest, saith the Lord,
   (Jeremiah 31:34.)

   The prophet assuredly does not take away or set aside instruction,
   which must be in its most vigorous state in the kingdom of Christ; but
   he affirms that, when all shall be taught by God, no room will be any
   longer left for this gross ignorance, which holds the minds of men,
   till Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, (Malachi 4:2,) shall enlighten
   them by the rays of his Spirit. Besides, though the apostles were
   exceedingly like children, or rather, were more like stocks of wood
   than men, we know well what they suddenly became, after having enjoyed
   the teaching of the Holy Spirit.

   Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name. He shows whence they will
   obtain this new faculty. It is because they will have it in their power
   to draw freely from God, the fountain of wisdom, as much as they need;
   as if he had said, "You must not fear that you will be deprived of the
   gift of understanding; for my Father will be ready, with all the
   abundance of blessings, to enrich you bountifully." Besides, by these
   words he informs them that the Spirit is not promised in such a manner
   that they to whom He is promised may wait for him in sloth and
   inactivity, but, on the contrary, that they may be earnestly employed
   in seeking the grace which is offered. In short, he declares that he
   will at that time discharge the office of Mediator, so that whatever
   they shall ask he will obtain for them from the Father abundantly, and
   beyond their prayers.

   But here arises a difficult question: Was this the first time that men
   began to call on God in the name of Christ? for never could God be
   reconciled to men in any other way than for the sake of the Mediator.
   Christ describes the future time, when the Heavenly Father will give to
   the disciples whatever they shall ask in his name If this be a new and
   unwonted favor, it would seem that we may infer from it that, so long
   as Christ dwelt on earth, he did not yet exercise the office of
   Advocate, that through him the prayers of believers might be acceptable
   to God. This is still more clearly expressed by what immediately
   follows.

   24. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name. It is probable that the
   apostles kept the rule of prayer which had been laid down in the Law.
   Now we know that the fathers were not accustomed to pray without a
   Mediator; for God had trained them, by so many exercises, to such a
   form of prayer. They saw the high priest enter into the holy place in
   the name of the whole people, and they saw sacrifices offered every
   day, that the prayers of the Church might be acceptable before God. It
   was, therefore, one of the principles of faith, that prayers offered to
   God, when there was no Mediator, were rash and useless. Christ had
   already testified to his disciples plainly enough that he was the
   Mediator, but their knowledge was so obscure, that they were not yet
   able to form their prayers in his name in a proper manner.

   Nor is there any absurdity in saying that they prayed to God, with
   confidence in the Mediator, according to the injunction of the Law, and
   yet did not clearly and fully understand what that meant. The veil of
   the temple was still stretched out, the majesty of God was concealed
   under the shadow of the cherubim, the true High Priest had not yet
   entered into the heavenly sanctuary to intercede for his people, and
   held not yet consecrated the way by his blood. We need not wonder,
   therefore, if he was not acknowledged to be the Mediator as he is, now
   that he appears for us in heaven before the Father, reconciling Him to
   us by his sacrifice, that we, miserable men, may venture to appear
   before him with boldness; for truly Christ, after having completed the
   satisfaction for sin, was received into heaven, and publicly showed
   himself to be the Mediator.

   But we ought to attend to the frequent repetition of this clause, that
   we must pray in the name of Christ. This teaches us that it is a wicked
   profanation of the name of God, when any one, leaving Christ out of
   view, ventures to present himself before the judgment-seat of God. And
   if this conviction be deeply impressed on our minds, that God will
   willingly and abundantly give to us whatever we shall ask in the name
   of his Son, we will not go hither and thither to call to our aid
   various advocates, but will be satisfied with having this single
   Advocate, who so frequently and so kindly offers to us his labors in
   our behalf. We are said to pray in the name of Christ when we take him
   as our Advocate, to reconcile us, and make us find favor with his
   Father, [101] though we do not expressly mention his name with our
   lips.

   Ask, and receive. This relates to the time of his manifestation, which
   was to take place soon afterwards. So much the less excusable are those
   who, in the present day, obscure this part of doctrine by the pretended
   intercessions of the Saints. The people, under the Old Testament, [102]
   had to turn their eyes to the high priest, (who was given to them to be
   a figure and shadow [103] ) and to the sacrifices of beasts, whenever
   they wished to pray. We are, therefore, worse than ungrateful, if we do
   not keep our senses fixed on the true High Priest, who is exhibited to
   us as our Propitiator, that by him we may have free and ready access to
   the throne of the glory of God. He adds, lastly,

   That your joy may be full. By this he means that nothing will be
   wanting which could contribute to a perfect abundance of all blessings,
   to the accomplishment of our desires, and to calm satisfaction,
   provided that we ask from God, in his name, whatever we need.

   John 16:25-28

   25. These things I have spoken to you in proverbs; but the time cometh
   when I shall no longer speak to you in parables, but will tell you
   plainly about the Father. 26. In that day you shall ask in my name and
   I do not say that I will pray the Father for you; 27. For the Father
   himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I
   came out from God. 28. I came out from the Father, and am come into the
   world again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.


   25. These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The intention of
   Christ is to give courage to his disciples, that, entertaining good
   hopes of making better progress, they may not think that the
   instruction to which they now listen is useless, though there be but
   little of it that they comprehend; for such a suspicion might lead them
   to suppose that Christ did not wish to be understood, and that he
   purposely kept them in suspense. He declares, therefore, that they will
   soon perceive the fruit of this doctrine, which, by its obscurity,
   might produce disgust in their minds. The Hebrew word, msl (mashal)
   sometimes denotes a proverb; but as proverbs most commonly contain
   tropes and figures, this is the reason why the Hebrews give the name of
   mslym (meshalim) to enigmas or remarkable sayings, which the Greeks
   call (apophthegmata) apophthegms, which have almost always some
   ambiguity or obscurity. The meaning therefore is, "You think that I now
   speak to you figuratively, and not in plain and direct language; but I
   will soon speak to you in a more familiar manner, in order that there
   may be nothing puzzling or difficult to you in my doctrine."

   We now see what I mentioned a little ago, that this is intended to
   encourage the disciples by holding out to them the expectation of
   making greater progress, that they may not reject the doctrine, because
   they do not yet understand what it means; for, if we are not animated
   by the hope of profiting, the desire of learning must, unavoidably, be
   cooled. The fact, however, clearly shows that Christ did not employ
   terms purposely obscure, but addressed his disciples in a simple and
   even homely style but such was their ignorance that they hung on his
   lips with astonishment. That obscurity, therefore, did not lie so much
   in the doctrine as in their understandings; and, indeed, the same thing
   happens to us in the present day, for not without good reason does the
   word of God receive this commendation, that it is our light, (Psalm
   119:105; 2 Peter 1:19;) but its brightness is so obscured by our
   darkness, that, what we hear we reckon to be pure allegories. For, as
   he threatens by the prophet, that he will be a barbarian to the
   unbelievers and reprobate, as if he had a stammering tongue, (Isaiah
   28:11;) and Paul says that

   the Gospel is hidden from such persons, because Satan hath blinded
   their understandings,
   (2 Corinthians 4:3, 4;)

   so to the weak and ignorant it commonly appears to be something so
   confused that it cannot be understood. For, though their understandings
   are not completely darkened, like those of unbelievers, still they are
   covered, as it were, with clouds. Thus God permits us to be stupefied
   for a time, in order to humble us by a conviction of our own poverty;
   but those whom he enlightens by his Spirit he causes to make such
   progress, that the word of God is known and familiar to them. Such,
   too, is the import of the next clause:

   But the time cometh; that is, the time will soon come, when I shall no
   more speak to you in figurative language. The Holy Spirit, certainly,
   did not teach the apostles anything else than what they had heard from
   the mouth of Christ himself, but, by enlightening their hearts, he
   drove away their darkness, so that they heard Christ speak, as it were,
   in a new and different manner, and thus they easily understood his
   meaning.

   But will tell you plainly about the Father. When he says that he will
   tell them about the Father, he reminds us that the design of his
   doctrine is to lead us to God, in whom true happiness lies. But another
   question remains: How does he say, elsewhere, that

   it was given to the disciples to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
   heaven?
   (Matthew 13:11.)

   For here he acknowledges that he has spoken to them in obscure
   language, but there he lays down a distinction between them and the
   rest of the people, that he speaketh to the people in parables,
   (Matthew 13:13.) I reply, the ignorance of the apostles was not so
   gross that they had not, at least, a slight perception of what their
   Master meant, and, therefore, it is not without reason that he excludes
   them from the number of the blind. He now says that his discourses have
   hitherto been allegorical, in comparison of that clear light of
   understanding which he would soon give to them by the grace of his
   Spirit. Both statements are therefore true, that the disciples were far
   above those who had no relish for the word of the Gospel, and yet they
   were still like children learning the alphabet, in comparison of the
   new wisdom which was bestowed on them by the Holy Spirit.

   26. In that day you shall ask in my name. He again repeats the reason
   why the heavenly treasures were then to be so bountifully opened up. It
   is, because they ask in the name of Christ whatever they need, and God
   will refuse nothing that shall be asked in the name of his Son. But
   there appears to be a contradiction in the words; for Christ
   immediately adds, that it will be unnecessary for him to pray to the
   Father Now, what purpose does it serve to pray in his name, if he does
   not undertake the office of Intercessor? In another passage John calls
   him our Advocate, ( 1 John 2:1.) Paul also testifies that Christ now
   intercedes for us, (Romans 8:34;) and the same thing is confirmed by
   the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who declares that Christ
   always liveth to make intercession for us, (Hebrews 7:25.) I reply,
   Christ does not absolutely say, in this passage, that he will not be
   Intercessor, but he only means, that the Father will be so favorably
   disposed towards the disciples, that, without any difficulty, he will
   give freely whatever they shall ask. "My Father," he says, "will meet
   you, and, on account of the great love which he bears towards you, will
   anticipate the Intercessor, who, otherwise, would speak on your
   behalf."

   Besides, when Christ is said to intercede with the Father for us, let
   us not indulge in carnal imaginations about him, as if he were on his
   knees before the Father, offering humble supplication in our name. But
   the value of his sacrifice, by which he once pacified God toward us, is
   always powerful and efficacious; the blood by which he atoned for our
   sins, the obedience which he rendered, is a continual intercession for
   us. This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that we have
   the heart of the Heavenly Father, [104] as soon as we have placed
   before Him the name of his Son.

   27. Because you have loved me. These words remind us that the only bond
   of our union with God is, to be united to Christ; and we are united to
   him by a faith which is not reigned, but which springs from sincere
   affection, which he describes by the name of love; for no man believes
   purely in Christ who does not cordially embrace him, and, therefore, by
   this word he has well expressed the power and nature of faith. But if
   it is only when we have loved Christ that God begins to love us, it
   follows that the commencement of salvation is from ourselves, because
   we have anticipated the grace of God. Numerous passages of Scripture,
   on the other hand, are opposed to this statement. The promise of God
   is, I will cause them to love me; and John says, Not that we first
   loved Him, [105] (1 John 4:10.) It would be superfluous to collect many
   passages; for nothing is more certain than this doctrine, that the Lord
   calleth those things which are not, (Romans 4:17) raises the dead,
   (Luke 7:22,) unites himself to those who were strangers to him,
   (Ephesians 2:12,) makes hearts of flesh out of hearts of stone,
   (Ezekiel 36:26,) manifests himself to those who do not seek him,
   (Isaiah 65:1; Romans 10:20.) I reply, God loves men in a secret way,
   before they are called, if they are among the elect; for he loves his
   own before they are created; but, as they are not yet reconciled, they
   are justly accounted enemies of God, as Paul speaks,

   When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
   Son,
   (Romans 5:10.)

   On this ground it is said that we are loved by God, when we love
   Christ; because we have the pledge of the fatherly love of Him from
   whom we formerly recoiled as our offended Judge.

   28. I came out from the Father. This mode of expression draws our
   attention to the Divine power which is in Christ. Our faith in him
   would not be steady, if it did not perceive his Divine power; for his
   death and resurrection, the two pillars of faith, would be of little
   avail to us, if heavenly power were not connected with them. We now
   understand in what manner we ought to love Christ. Our love ought to be
   of such a nature that our faith shall contemplate the purpose and power
   of God, by whose hand he is offered to us. for we must not receive
   coldly the statement that he came out from God, but must also
   understand for what reason and for what purpose he came out, namely,
   that he might be

   to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,
   (1 Corinthians 1:30.)

   Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. By this second clause
   he points out to us that this power is perpetual- for the disciples
   might have thought that it was a temporary blessing, that he was sent
   into the world to be a Redeemer. He therefore said that he returns to
   the Father, that they may be fully persuaded that none of those
   blessings which he brought are lost by his departure, because from his
   heavenly glory he sheds on the world the power and efficacy of his
   death and resurrection. He therefore left the world when, laying aside
   our weaknesses, he was received into heaven; but his grace toward us is
   still in all its force, because he is seated at the right hand of the
   Father, that he may sway the scepter of the whole world. [106]

   John 16:29-33

   29. His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speakest openly, and
   speakest no proverb. 30. Now we know that thou knowest all things, and
   needest not that any one should ask thee; by this we believe that thou
   camest out from God. 31. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? 32.
   Behold, the hour cometh, and is now come, when you shall be scattered,
   every one to his own, and shall leave me alone; yet I am not alone,
   because the Father is with me. 33. These things I have spoken to you,
   that you may have peace in me. In the world you will have tribulation;
   but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.


   29. His disciples say to him. This shows how great was the efficacy of,
   that consolation, for it suddenly brought into a state of great
   cheerfulness those minds which formerly were broken and cast down. And
   yet it is certain that the disciples did not yet understand fully the
   meaning of Christ's discourse; but though they were not yet capable of
   this, the mere odor of it refreshed them. When they exclaim that their
   Master speaketh openly, and without a figure, their language is
   certainly extravagant, and yet they state honestly what they feel. The
   same thing falls within our own experience in the present day; for he
   who has only tasted a little of the doctrine of the Gospel is more
   inflamed, and feels much greater energy in that small measure of faith,
   than if he had been acquainted with all the writings of Plato. Not only
   so, but the roads which the Spirit of God produces in the hearts of the
   godly are sufficient proofs that God worketh in a secret manner beyond
   their capacity; for otherwise Paul would not call them groans that
   cannot be uttered, (Romans 8:26.)

   Thus we ought to understand that the apostles were conscious of having
   made some progress, so that they could say with truth, that they did
   not now find the words of Christ to be altogether obscure; but that
   they were deceived in this respect, that they thought they understood
   more than they did. Now the source of their mistake was, that they did
   not know what the gift of the Holy Spirit would be. They therefore give
   themselves up to joy before the time, just as if a person should think
   himself rich with a single gold piece. They conclude, from certain
   signs, that Christ came out from God, and they glory in it, as if
   nothing more were needed. Yet still they were far from that knowledge,
   so long as they did not understand what Christ would be to them in
   future.

   31. Do you now believe? As the disciples were too highly pleased with
   themselves, Christ reminds them that, remembering their weakness, they
   ought rather to confine themselves within their own little capacity.
   Now, we never are fully aware of what we want, and of our great
   distance from the fullness of faith, till we come to some serious
   trial; for then the fact shows how weak our faith was, which we
   imagined to be full. Christ recalls the attention of the disciples to
   this matter, and declares that they will ere long forsake him; for
   persecution is a touchstone to try faith, and when its smallness
   becomes evident, they who formerly were swelled with pride begin to
   tremble and to draw back.

   The question put by Christ is therefore ironical; as if he had said,
   "Do you boast as if you were full of faith? But the trial is at hand,
   which will disclose your emptiness." In this manner we ought to
   restrain our foolish confidence, when it indulges itself too freely.
   But it might be thought, either that the disciples had no faith at all,
   or that it was extinguished, when they had forsaken Christ, and were
   scattered in all directions. I reply, though their faith was weakened,
   and had almost given way, still something was left, from which fresh
   branches might afterwards shoot forth.

   32. Yet I am not alone. This correction is added, in order to inform us
   that, when Christ is forsaken by men, he loses nothing of his dignity.
   For since his truth and his glory are founded on himself, and. do not
   depend on what the world believes, if it happen that he is forsaken by
   the whole world, still he is in no degree impaired, because he is God,
   and needs not any assistance from another.

   Because my Father is with me. When he says that the Father will be with
   me, the meaning is, that God will be on his side, so that he will have
   no need to borrow anything from men. Whoever shall meditate on this in
   a proper manner will remain firm, though the whole world should be
   shaken, and the revolt of all men will not overturn his faith; for we
   do not render to God the honor which is due to him, if we are not
   satisfied with having God alone.

   33. These things I have spoken to you. He again repeats how necessary
   those consolations are which he had addressed to them; and he proves it
   by this argument, that numerous distresses and tribulations await them
   in the world. We ought to attend, first, to this admonition, that all
   believers ought to be convinced that their life is exposed to many
   afflictions, that they may be disposed to exercise patience. Since,
   therefore, the world is like a troubled sea, true peace will be found
   nowhere but in Christ. Next, we ought to attend to the manner of
   enjoying that peace, which he describes in this passage. He says that
   they will have peace, if they make progress in this doctrine. Do we
   wish then to have our minds calm and easy in the midst of afflictions?
   Let us be attentive to this discourse of Christ, which in itself will
   give us peace

   But be of good courage. As our sluggishness must be corrected by
   various afflictions, and as we must be awakened to seek a remedy for
   our distress, so the Lord does not intend that our minds shall be cast
   down, but rather that we shall fight keenly, which is impossible, if we
   are not certain of success; for if we must fight, while we are
   uncertain as to the result, all our zeal will quickly vanish. When,
   therefore, Christ calls us to the contest, he arms us with assured
   confidence of victory, though still we must toil hard.

   I have overcome the world. As there is always in us much reason for
   trembling, he shows that we ought to be confident for this reason, that
   he has obtained a victory over the world, not for himself individually,
   but for our sake. Thus, though in ourselves almost overwhelmed, if we
   contemplate that magnificent glory to which our Head has been exalted,
   we may boldly despise all the evils which hang over us. If, therefore,
   we desire to be Christians, we must not seek exemption from the cross,
   but must be satisfied with this single consideration, that, fighting
   under the banner of Christ, we are beyond all danger, even in the midst
   of the combat. Under the term World, Christ here includes all that is
   opposed to the salvation of believers, and especially all the
   corruptions which Satan abuses for the purpose of laying snares for us.

   CHAPTER 17
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 17:1-5

   1. These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
   Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
   glorify thee: 2. As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he
   may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given to him. 3. And this
   is eternal life, that they may know thee, the only true God, and him
   whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ. 4. I have glorified thee on the
   earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 5. And now,
   O Father, glorify thou me with thyself, with the glory which I had with
   thee before the world was.


   1. These words spake Jesus. After having preached to the disciples
   about bearing the cross, the Lord exhibited to them those consolations,
   by relying on which they would be enabled to persevere. Having promised
   the coming of the Spirit, he raised them to a better hope, and
   discoursed to them about the splendor and glory of his reign. Now he
   most properly betakes himself to prayer; for doctrine has no power, if
   efficacy be not imparted to it from above. He, therefore, holds out an
   example to teachers, not to employ themselves only in sowing the word,
   but, by mingling their prayers with it, to implore the assistance of
   God, that his blessing may render their labor fruitful. In short, this
   passage of the Lord Jesus [107] Christ might be said to be the seal of
   the preceding doctrine, both that it might be ratified in itself, and
   that it might obtain full credit with the disciples.

   And lifted up his eyes to heaven. This circumstance related by John,
   that Christ prayed, lifting up his eyes to heaven, was an indication of
   uncommon ardor and vehemence; for by this attitude Christ testified
   that, in the affections of his mind, he was rather in heaven than in
   earth, so that, leaving men behind him, he converted familiarly with
   God. He looked towards heaven, not as if God's presence were confined
   to heaven, for He filleth also the earth, (Jeremiah 23:24,) but because
   it is there chiefly that his majesty is displayed. Another reason was,
   that, by looking towards heaven, we are reminded that the majesty of
   God is far exalted above all creatures. It is with the same view that
   the hands are lifted up in prayer; for men, being by nature indolent
   and slow, and drawn downwards by their earthly disposition, need such
   excitements, or I should rather say, chariots, to raise them to heaven

   Yet if we desire actually to imitate Christ, we must take care that
   outward gestures do not express more than is in our mind, but that the
   inward feeling shall direct the eyes, the hands, the tongue, and every
   thing about us. We are told, indeed, that the publican, with downcast
   eyes, prayed aright to God, (Luke 18:13,) but that is not inconsistent
   with what has now been stated; for, though he was confused and humbled
   on account of his sins, still this self-abasement did not prevent him
   from seeking pardon with full confidence. But it was proper that Christ
   should pray in a different manner, for he had nothing about him of
   which he ought to be ashamed; and it is certain that David himself
   prayed sometimes in one attitude, and sometimes in another, according
   to the circumstances in which he was placed.

   Father, the hour is come. Christ asks that his kingdom may be
   glorified, in order that he also may advance the glory of the Father.
   He says that the hour is come, because though, by miracles and by every
   kind of supernatural events, he had been manifested to be the Son of
   God, yet his spiritual kingdom was still in obscurity, but soon
   afterwards shone with full brightness. If it be objected, that never
   was there any thing less glorious than the death of Christ, which was
   then at hand, I reply, that in that death we behold a magnificent
   triumph which is concealed from wicked men; for there we perceive that,
   atonement having been made for sins, the world has been reconciled to
   God, the curse has been blotted out, and Satan has been vanquished.

   It is also the object of Christ's prayer, that his death may produce,
   through the power of the Heavenly Spirit, such fruit as had been
   decreed by the eternal purpose of God; for he says that the hour is
   come, not an hour which is determined by the fancy of men, but an hour
   which God had appointed. And yet the prayer is not superfluous,
   because, while Christ depends on the good pleasure of God, he knows
   that he ought to desire what God promised would certainly take place.
   True, God will do whatever he has decreed, not only though the whole
   world were asleep, but though it were opposed to him; but it is our
   duty to ask from him whatever he has promised, because the end and use
   [108] of promises is to excite us to prayer.

   That thy Son also may glorify thee. He means that there is a mutual
   connection between the advancement of his glory and of the glory of his
   Father; for why is Christ manifested, but that he may lead us to the
   Father? Hence it follows, that all the honor which is bestowed on
   Christ is so far from diminishing the honor of the Father, that it
   confirms it the more. We ought always to remember under what character
   Christ speaks in this passage; for we must not look only at his eternal
   Divinity, because he speaks as God manifested in the flesh, and
   according to the office of Mediator.

   2. As thou hast given him. He again confirms the statement, that he
   asks nothing but what is agreeable to the will of the Father; as it is
   a constant rule o prayer not to ask more than God would freely bestow;
   for nothing is more contrary to reason, than to bring forward in the
   presence of God whatever we choose.

   Power over all flesh means the authority which was given to Christ,
   when the Father appointed him to be King and Head; but we must observe
   the end, which is, to give eternal life to all his people. Christ
   receives authority, not so much for himself as for the sake of our
   salvation; and, therefore, we ought to submit to Christ, not only that
   we may obey God, but because nothing is more lovely than that
   subjection, since it brings to us eternal life.

   To all whom thou hast given me. Christ does not say that he has been
   made Governor over the whole world, in order to bestow life on all
   without any distinction; but he limits this grace to those who have
   been given to him But how were they given to him? For the Father has
   subjected to him the reprobate. I reply, it is only the elect who
   belong to his peculiar flock, which he has undertaken to guard as a
   Shepherd. So then, the kingdom of Christ extends, no doubt, to all men;
   but it brings salvation to none but the elect, who with voluntary
   obedience follow the voice of the Shepherd; for the others are
   compelled by violence to obey him, till at length he utterly bruise
   them with his iron scepter.

   3. And this is eternal life He now describes the manner of bestowing
   life, namely, when he enlightens the elect in the true knowledge of
   God; for he does not now speak of the enjoyment of life which we hope
   for, but only of the manner in which men obtain life And that this
   verse may be fully understood, we ought first to know that we are all
   in death, till we are enlightened by God, who alone is life Where he
   has shone, we possess him by faith, and, therefore, we also enter into
   the possession of life; and this is the reason why the knowledge of him
   is truly and justly called saving, or bringing salvation. [109] Almost
   every one of the words has its weight; for it is not every kind of
   knowledge that is here described, but that knowledge which forms us
   anew into the image of God from faith to faith, or rather, which is the
   same with faith, by which, having been engrafted into the body of
   Christ, we are made partakers of the Divine adoption, and heirs of
   heaven. [110]

   To know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. The reason why he
   says this is, that there is no other way in which God is known but in
   the face of Jesus Christ, who is the bright and lively image of Him. As
   to his placing the Father first, this does not refer to the order of
   faith, as if our minds, after having known God, afterwards descend to
   Christ; but the meaning is, that it is by the intervention of a
   Mediator that God is known.

   The only true God. Two epithets are added, true and only; because, in
   the first place, faith must distinguish God from the vain inventions of
   men, and embracing him with firm conviction, must never change or
   hesitate; and, secondly, believing that there is nothing defective or
   imperfect in God, faith must be satisfied with him alone. Some explain
   it, That they may know thee, who alone art God; but this is a poor
   interpretation. The meaning therefore is, That they may know thee alone
   to be the true God

   But it may be thought that Christ disclaims for himself the right and
   title of Divinity. Were it replied, that the name of God is quite as
   applicable to Christ as to the Father, the same question might be
   raised about the Holy Spirit; for if only the Father and the Son are
   God, the Holy Spirit is excluded from that rank, which is as absurd as
   the former. The answer is easy, if we attend to that manner of speaking
   which Christ uniformly employs throughout the Gospel of John, of which
   I have already reminded my readers so frequently, that they must have
   become quite accustomed to it. Christ, appearing in the form of a man,
   describes, under the person of the Father, the power, essence, and
   majesty of God. So then the Father of Christ is the only true God; that
   is, he is the one God, who formerly promised a Redeemer to the world;
   but in Christ the oneness and truth of Godhead will be found, because
   Christ was humbled, in order that he might raise us on high. When we
   have arrived at this point, then his Divine majesty displays itself;
   then we perceive that he is wholly in the Father, and that the Father
   is wholly in him. In short, he who separates Christ from the Divinity
   of the Father, does not yet acknowledge Him who is the only true God,
   but rather invents for himself a strange god. This is the reason why we
   are enjoined to know God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, by whom,
   as it were, with outstretched hand, he invites us to himself.

   As to the opinion entertained by some, that it would be unjust, if men
   were to perish solely on account of their ignorance of God, it arises
   from their not considering that there is no fountain of life but in God
   alone, and that all who are alienated from him are deprived of life.
   Now, if there be no approach to God but by faith, we are forced to
   conclude, that unbelief keeps us in a state of death. If it be
   objected, that persons otherwise righteous and innocent are unjustly
   treated, if they are condemned, the answer is obvious, that nothing
   right or sincere is found in men, so long as they remain in their
   natural state. Now, Paul informs us that

   we are renewed in the image of God by the knowledge of him,
   (Colossians 3:10.)

   It will be of importance for us now to bring into one view those three
   articles of faith; first, that the kingdom of Christ brings life, and
   salvation; secondly, that all do not receive life from him, and it is
   not the office of Christ to give life to all, but only to the elect
   whom the Father has committed to his protection; and, thirdly, that
   this life consists in faith, and Christ bestow, it on those whom he
   enlightens in the faith of the Gospel. Hence we infer that the gift of
   illumination and heavenly wisdom is not common to all, but peculiar to
   the elect. It is unquestionably true that the Gospel is offered to all,
   but Christ speaks here of that secret and efficacious manner of
   teaching by which the children of God only are drawn to faith.

   4. I have glorified thee. His reason for saying this is, that God had
   been made known to the world both by the doctrine of Christ, and by his
   miracles; and the glory of God is, when we know what he is. When he
   adds, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do, he means
   that he has completed the whole course of his calling; for the full
   time was come when he ought to be received into the heavenly glory Nor
   does he speak only of the office of teaching, but includes also the
   other parts of his ministry; for, though the chief part of it still
   remained to be accomplished, namely, the sacrifice of death, by which
   he was to take away the iniquities of us all, yet, as the hour of his
   death was already at hand, he speaks as if he had already endured it.
   The amount of his request, therefore, is that the Father would put him
   in possession of the kingdom; since, having completed his course,
   nothing more remained for him to do, than to display, by the power of
   the Spirit, the fruit and efficacy of all that he had done on earth by
   the command of his Father, according to the saying of Paul,

   He humbled and annihilated himself, [111] by taking the form of a
   servant. Therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
   which is above every name,
   (Philippians 2:7, 10.)

   5. The glory which I had with thee. He desires to be glorified with the
   Father, not that the Father may glorify him secretly, without any
   witnesses, but that, having been received into heaven, he may give a
   magnificent display of his greatness and power, that every knee may bow
   to him, (Philippians 2:10.) Consequently, that phrase in the former
   clause, with the Father, is contrasted with earthly and fading glory,
   as Paul describes the blessed immortality of Christ, by saying that

   he died to sin once, but now he liveth to God, (Romans 6:10.)

   The glory which I had with thee before the world was. He now declares
   that he desires nothing that does not strictly belong to him, but only
   that he may appear in the flesh, such as he was before the creation of
   the world; or, to speak more plainly, that the Divine majesty, which he
   had always possessed, may now be illustriously displayed in the person
   of the Mediator, and in the human flesh with which he was clothed. This
   is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that Christ is not a God who
   has been newly contrived, or who has existed only for a time; for if
   his glory was eternal, himself also has always been. Besides, a
   manifest distinction between the person of Christ and the person of the
   rather is here expressed; from which we infer, that he is not only the
   eternal God, but also that he is the eternal Word of God, begotten by
   the rather before all ages.

   John 17:6-11

   6. I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of
   the world; thine they were, and thou hast given them to me, and they
   have kept thy word. 7. Now they have known that all things which thou
   hast given me are from thee; 8. For I have given to them the words
   which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known truly
   that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou hast sent me. 9.
   I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those whom thou
   hast given me, for they are thine; 10. And all that is mine is thine,
   and thine is mine; [112] and I am glorified in them. 11. And I am no
   longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.
   Holy Father, keep in thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they
   may be one, as we are.


   6. I have manifested thy name. Here Christ begins to pray to the Father
   for his disciples, and, with the same warmth of love with which he was
   immediately to suffer death for them, he now pleads for their
   salvation. The first argument which he employs on their behalf is, that
   they have embraced the doctrine which makes men actually children of
   God. There was no want of faith or diligence on the part of Christ, to
   call all men to God, but among the elect only was his labor profitable
   and efficacious. His preaching, which manifested the name of God, was
   common to all, and he never ceased to maintain the glory of it even
   among the obstinate. Why then does he say that it was only to a small
   number of persons that he manifested the name of his Father, but
   because the elect alone profit by the grace of the Spirit, who teaches
   inwardly? [113] Let us therefore infer that not all to whom the
   doctrine is exhibited are truly and efficaciously taught, but only
   those whose minds are enlightened. Christ ascribes the cause to the
   election of God; for he assigns no other difference as the reason why
   he manifested the name of the Father to some, passing by others, but
   because they were given to him. Hence it follows their faith flows from
   the outward predestination of God, and that therefore it is not given
   indiscriminately to all, because all do not belong to Christ. [114]

   Thine they were, and thou hast given them to me. By adding these words,
   he points out, first, the eternity of election; and, secondly, the
   manner in which we ought to consider it. Christ declares that the elect
   always belonged to God. God therefore distinguishes them from the
   reprobate, not by faith, or by any merit, but by pure grace; for, while
   they are alienated from him to the utmost, still he reckons them as his
   own in his secret purpose. The certainty of that election by free grace
   [115] lies in this, that he commits to the guardianship of his son all
   whom he has elected, that they may not perish; and this is the point to
   which we should turn our eyes, that we may be fully certain that we
   belong to the rank of the children of God; for the predestination of
   God is in itself hidden, but it is manifested to us in Christ alone.

   And they have kept thy word. This is the third step; for the first is,
   the election by free grace, and the second is, that gift by which we
   enter into the guardianship of Christ. Having been received by Christ,
   we are gathered by faith into the fold. The word of God flows out to
   the reprobate, but it takes root in the elect, and hence they are said
   to keep it.

   7. Now they have known. Here our Lord expresses what is the chief part
   in faith, which consists in our believing in Christ in such a manner,
   that faith does not rest satisfied with beholding the flesh, but
   perceives his Divine power. For when he says, They have known that all
   things which thou hast given me are from thee, he means, that believers
   feel that all that they possess is heavenly and divine. And, indeed, if
   we do not perceive God in Christ, we must remain continually in a state
   of hesitation.

   8. And they have received them. He expresses the manner of this
   knowledge. It is, because they have received the doctrine which he
   taught them. But that no one may think that his doctrine is human or is
   earthly in its origin, he declares that God is the Author of it, when
   he says, The words which thou gavest me I have given to them. He speaks
   according to his ordinary custom, in the person of the Mediator or
   servant of God, when he says that he taught nothing but what he had
   received from the Father; for, since his own condition was still mean,
   while he was in the flesh, and since his Divine majesty was concealed
   under the form of a servant, under the person of the Father he simply
   means God. Yet we must hold by the statement which John made at the
   beginning of his Gospel, that, in so far as Christ was the Eternal Word
   of God, he was always one God with the Father. The meaning therefore
   is, that Christ was a faithful witness of God to the disciples, so that
   their faith was founded exclusively on the truth of God, since the
   Father himself spoke in the Son. The receiving, of which he speaks,
   arose from his having efficaciously manifested to them the name of his
   Father by the Holy Spirit.

   And have known truly. He now repeats in other words what he had
   formerly mentioned; for that Christ came out from the Father, and was
   sent by him, has the same meaning with what went before, that all
   things which he has are from the Father. The meaning amounts to this,
   that faith ought to cast its eyes direct on Christ, yet so as to form
   no conception of him that is earthly or mean, but to be carried upwards
   to his Divine power, so as to believe firmly that he has perfectly in
   himself God, and all that belongs to God.

   And have believed. Let it be observed, also, that in the former clause
   he employs the verb know and now he employs the verb believe; for thus
   he shows that nothing which relates to God can be known aright but by
   faith, but that in faith there is such certainty that it is justly
   called knowledge.

   9. I pray for them. Hitherto Christ has brought forward what might
   procure for the disciples favor with the Father. He now forms the
   prayer itself, in which he shows that he asks nothing but what is
   agreeable to the will of the Father, because he pleads with the Father
   in behalf of those only whom the Father himself willingly loves. He
   openly declares that he does not pray for the world, because he has no
   solicitude but about his own flock, which he received from the hand of
   the Father. But this might be thought to be absurd; for no better rule
   of prayer can be found than to follow Christ as our Guide and Teacher.
   Now, we are commanded to pray for all, (1 Timothy 2:8) and Christ
   himself afterwards prayed indiscriminately for all,

   Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do,
   (Luke 23:34.)

   I reply, the prayers which we offer for all are still limited to the
   elect of God. We ought to pray that this man, and that man, and every
   man, may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we
   cannot yet distinguish the elect from the reprobate; and yet, while we
   desire the coming of the kingdom of God, we likewise pray that God may
   destroy his enemies.

   There is only this difference between the two cases, that we pray for
   the salvation of all whom we know to have been created after the image
   of God, and who have the same nature with ourselves; and we leave to
   the judgment of God those whom he knows to be reprobate. But in the
   prayer which is here related there was some special reason, which ought
   not to be produced as an example; for Christ does not now pray from the
   mere impulse of faith and of love towards men, but, entering into the
   heavenly sanctuary, he places before his eyes the secret judgments of
   the Father, which are concealed from us, so long as we walk by faith.

   Besides, we learn from these words, that God chooses out of the world
   those whom he thinks fit to choose to be heirs of life, and that this
   distinction is not made according to the merit of men, but depends on
   his mere good-pleasure. For those who think that the cause of election
   is in men must begin with faith. Now, Christ expressly declares that
   they who are given to him belong to the Father; and it is certain that
   they are given so as to believe, and that faith flows from this act of
   giving. If the origin of faith is this act of giving, and if election
   comes before it in order and time, what remains but that we acknowledge
   that those whom God wishes to be saved out of the world are elected by
   free grace? Now since Christ prays for the elect only, it is necessary
   for us to believe the doctrine of election, if we wish that he should
   plead with the Father for our salvation. A grievous injury, therefore,
   is inflicted on believers by those persons who endeavor to blot out the
   knowledgeof election from the hearts of believers, because they deprive
   them of the pleading and intercession of the Son of God. [116] These
   words serve also to expose the stupidity of those who, under the
   pretence of election, give themselves up to the indolence, whereas it
   ought rather to arouse us to earnestness in prayer, as Christ teaches
   us by his example.

   10. And all things that are mine are thine. The object of the former
   clause is to show that the Father will assuredly listen to him. "I do
   not," says he, "plead with thee for any but those whom thou
   acknowledgest to be thine, for I have nothing separated from thee, and
   therefore I shall not meet with a refusal." In the second clause, and
   thine are mine, he shows that he has good reason for caring about the
   elect; for they are his in consequence of their being his Father's. All
   these things are spoken for the confirmation of our faith. We must not
   seek salvation anywhere else than in Christ. But we shall not be
   satisfied with having Christ, if we do not know that we possess God in
   him. We must therefore believe that there is such a unity between the
   Father and the Son as makes it impossible that they shall have anything
   separate from each other.

   And I am glorified in them. This is connected with the second clause of
   the verse, and thine are mine; for it follows that it is reasonable
   that he, for his part, should promote their salvation; and this is a
   most excellent testimony for confirming our faith, that Christ never
   will cease to care for our salvation, since he is glorified in us.

   11. And I am no longer in the world. He assigns another reason why he
   prays so earnestly for the disciples, namely, because they will very
   soon be deprived of his bodily presence, under which they had reposed
   till now. So long as he dwelt with them, he cherished them,

   as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
   (Matthew 23:37;)

   but now that he is about to depart, he asks that the Father will guard
   them by his protection. And he does so on their account; for he
   provides a remedy for their trembling, that they may rely on God
   himself, to whose hands, as it were, he now commits them. It yields no
   small consolation to us, when we learn that the Son of God becomes so
   much the more earnest about the salvation of his people, when he leaves
   them as to his bodily presence; for we ought to conclude from it, that,
   while we are labouring under difficulties in the world, he keeps his
   eye on us, to send down, from his heavenly glory, relief from our
   distresses.

   Holy Father. The whole prayer is directed to this object, that the
   disciples may not lose courage, as if their condition were made worse
   on account of the bodily absence of their Master. For Christ, having
   been appointed by the Father to be their guardian for a time, and
   having now discharged the duties of that office gives them back again,
   as it were, into the hands of the Father, that henceforth they may
   enjoy his protection, and may be upheld by his power. It amounts
   therefore to this, that, when the disciples are deprived of Christ's
   bodily presence they suffer no loss, because God receives them under
   his guardianship, the efficacy of which shall never cease.

   That they may be one. This points out the way in which they shall be
   kept; for those whom the Heavenly Father has decreed to keep, he brings
   together in a holy unity of faith and of the Spirit. But as it is not
   enough that men be agreed in some manner, he adds, As we are. Then will
   our unity be truly happy, when it shall bear the image of God the
   Father and of Christ, as the wax takes the form of the seal which is
   impressed upon it. But in what manner the Father, and Jesus Christ
   [117] his Son, are one, I shall shortly afterwards explain.

   John 17:12-13

   12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those
   whom thou hast given to me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but
   the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 13. And
   now I come to thee, and speak those things in the world, that they may
   have my joy fulfilled in themselves.


   12. While I was with them in the world. Christ says that he hath kept
   them in the name of his Father; for he represents himself to be only a
   servant, who did nothing but by the power, and under the protection, of
   God. He means, therefore, that it were most unreasonable to suppose
   that they would now perish, as if by his departure the power of God had
   been extinguished or dead. But it may be thought very absurd that
   Christ surrenders to God the office of keeping them, as if, after
   having finished the course of his life, he ceased to be the guardian of
   his people. The reply is obvious. He speaks here of visible
   guardianship only which ended at the death of Christ; for, while he
   dwelt on earth, he needed not to borrow power from another, in order to
   keep his disciples; but all this relates to the person of the Mediator,
   who appeared, for a time, under the form of a servant. But now he bids
   the disciples, as soon as they have begun to be deprived of the
   external aid, to raise their eyes direct towards heaven. Hence we infer
   that Christ keeps believers in the present day not less than he
   formerly did, but in a different manner, because Divine majesty is
   openly displayed in him.

   Whom thou hast given me. He again employs the same argument, that it
   would be highly unbecoming that the Father should reject those whom his
   Son, by his command, has kept to the very close of his ministry; as if
   he had said, "What thou didst commit to me I have faithfully executed,
   and I took care that nothing was lost in my hands; and when thou now
   receivest what thou hadst intrusted to me, it belongs to thee to see
   that it continue to be safe and sound."

   But the son of perdition. Judas is excepted, and not without reason;
   for, though he was not one of the elect and of the true flock of God,
   yet the dignity of his office gave him the appearance of it; and,
   indeed, no one would have formed a different opinion of him, so long as
   he held that exalted rank. Tried by the rules of grammar, [118] the
   exception is incorrect; but if we examine the matter narrowly, it was
   necessary that Christ should speak thus, in accommodation to the
   ordinary opinion of men. But, that no one might think that the eternal
   election of God was overturned by the damnation of Judas, he
   immediately added, that he was the son of perdition By these words
   Christ means that his ruin, which took place suddenly before the eyes
   of men, had been known to God long before; for the son of perdition,
   according to the Hebrew idiom, denotes a man who is ruined, or devoted
   to destruction.

   That the Scripture might be fulfilled. This relates to the former
   clause. Judas fell, that the Scripture might be fulfilled But it would
   be a most unfounded argument, if any one were to infer from this, that
   the revolt of Judas ought to be ascribed to God rather than to himself;
   because the prediction laid him under a nccesslty. For the course of
   events ought not to be ascribed to prophecies, because it was predicted
   in them; and, indeed, the prophets threaten nothing but what would have
   happened, though they had not spoken of it. It is not in the
   prophecies, therefore, that we must go to seek the cause of events. I
   acknowledge, indeed, that nothing happens but what has been appointed
   by God; but the only question now is, Do those things which it has
   foretold, or predicted, lay men under a necessity? which I have already
   demonstrated to be false.

   Nor was it the design of Christ to transfer to Scripture the cause of
   the ruin of Judas, but he only intended to take away the occasion of
   stumbling, which might shake weak minds. [119] Now the method of
   removing it is, by showing that the Spirit of God had long ago
   testified that such an event would happen; for we commonly startle at
   what is new and sudden. This is a highly useful admonition, and admits
   of extensive application. For how comes it that in our own day, the
   greater part of men give way on account of offences, but because they
   do not remember the testimonies of Scripture, by which God has
   abundantly fortified his people, having foretold early all the evils
   and distresses which would come before their eyes?

   13. And these things I speak in the world. Here Christ shows that the
   reason why he was so earnest in praying for his disciples was, not that
   he was anxious about their future condition, but rather to provide a
   remedy for their anxiety. We know how prone our minds are to seek
   external aids; and if these present themselves, we eagerly seize them,
   and do not easily suffer ourselves to be torn from them. Christ,
   therefore, prays to his Father in the presence of his disciples, not
   because he needed any words, but to remove from them all doubt. I speak
   in the world, says he; that is, within their hearing, or, in their
   presence, [120] that their minds may be calm; for their salvation
   already was in no danger, having been placed by Christ in the hands of
   God.

   That they may have my joy fulfilled. He calls it HIS joy, because it
   was necessary that the disciples should obtain it from him; or, if you
   choose to express it more briefly, he calls it his, because he is the
   Author, Cause, and Pledge of it; for in us there is nothing but alarm
   and uneasiness, but in Christ alone there is peace and joy.

   John 17:14-19

   14. I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them; because
   they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 15. I ask not
   that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest
   keep them from the evil. 16. They are not of the world, even as I am
   not of the world. 17. Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth.
   18. As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the
   world. 19. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be
   sanctified by the truth.


   14. I have given them thy word. He employs a different argument in
   pleading with the Father on behalf of the disciples. It is, because
   they need his assistance on account of the hatred of the world. He
   likewise declares the cause of that hatred to be, that they have
   embraced the word of God, which the world cannot receive; as if he had
   said, "It belongs to thee to protect those who, on account of thy word,
   are hated by the world." We must now keep in remembrance what we have
   lately heard, that the end of this prayer is, that Christ's joy may be
   fulflled in us As often, therefore, as the rage of the world is kindled
   against us to such an extent that we think we are very near
   destruction, let us learn suddenly to ward it off by this shield, that
   God will never forsake those who labor in defense of the Gospel.

   Because they are not of the world. He says that his disciples are not
   of the world, because all those whom he regenerates by his Spirit are
   separated from the world God will not suffer his sheep to wander among
   wolves, without showing himself to be their shepherd.

   15. I ask not that thou shouldest take them out of the world. He shows
   in what the safety of believers [121] consists; not that they are free
   from every annoyance, and live in luxury and at their ease, but that,
   in the midst of dangers, they continue to be safe through the
   assistance of God. For he does not admonish the Father of what is
   proper to be done, but rather makes provision for their weakness, that,
   by the method which he prescribes, they may restrain their desires,
   which are apt to go beyond all bounds. In short, he promises to his
   disciples the grace of the Father; not to relieve them from all anxiety
   and toil, but to furnish them with invincible strength against their
   enemies, and not to suffer them to be overwhelmed by the heavy burden
   of contests which they will have to endure. If, therefore, we wish to
   be kept according to the rule which Christ has laid down, we must not
   desire exemption from evils, or pray to God to convey us immediately
   into a state of blessed rest, but must rest satisfied with the certain
   assurance of victory, and, in the meantime, resist courageously all the
   evils, from which Christ prayed to his Father that we might have a
   happy issue. In short, God does not take his people out of the world,
   because he does not wish them to be effeminate and slothful; but he
   delivers them from evil, that they may not be overwhelmed; for he
   wishes them to fight, but does not suffer them to be mortally wounded.

   16. They are not of the world. That the heavenly Father may be more
   favourably disposed to assist them, he again says that the whole world
   hates them, and, at the same time, states that this hatred does not
   arise from any fault of theirs, but because the world hates God and
   Christ.

   17. Sanctify them by thy truth. This sanctification includes the
   kingdom of God and his righteousness; that is, when God renews us by
   his Spirit, and confirms in us the grace of renewal, and continues it
   to the end. He asks, first, therefore, that the Father would sanctify
   the disciples, or, in other words, that he would consecrate them
   entirely to himself, and defend them as his sacred inheritance. Next,
   he points out the means of sanctification, and not without reason; for
   there are fanatics who indulge in much useless prattle about
   sanctification, but who neglect the truth of God, by which he
   consecrates us to himself. Again, as there are others who chatter quite
   as foolishly about the truth and yet disregard the word, Christ
   expressly says that the truth, by which God sanctifies his sons, is not
   to be found any where else than in the word.

   Thy word is truth; for the word here denotes the doctrine of the
   Gospel, which the apostles had already heard from the mouth of their
   Master, and which they were afterwards to preach to others. In this
   sense Paul says that

   the Church has been cleansed with the washing of water by the word of
   life,
   (Ephesians 5:26

   True, it is God alone who sanctifies; but as

   the Gospel is the power of God to salvation to every one that
   believeth,
   (Romans 1:16,)

   whoever departs from the Gospel as the means must become more and more
   filthy and polluted.

   The truth is here taken, by way of eminence, for the light of heavenly
   wisdom, in which God manifests himself to us, that he may conform us to
   his image. The outward preaching of the word, it is true, does not of
   itself accomplish this, For that preaching is wickedly profaned by the
   reprobate; but let us remember that Christ speaks of the elect whom the
   Holy Spirit efficaciously regenerates by the word. Now, as the apostles
   were not altogether destitute of this grace, we ought to infer from
   Christ's words, that sanctification is not instantly completed in us on
   the first day, but that we make progress in it through the whole course
   of our life, till at length God, having taken away from us the garment
   of the flesh, fills us with his righteousness.

   18. As thou hast sent me into the world. He confirms his prayer by
   another argument; namely, because the calling of Christ and of the
   apostles is the same calling, and is common to both. "I now," he says,
   "appoint them to an office, which I have hitherto held by thy command;
   and, therefore, it is necessary that they should be furnished with the
   power of thy Spirit, that they may be able to sustain so weighty a
   charge."

   19. And for their sales I sanctify myself. By these words he explains
   more clearly from what source that sanctification flows, which is
   completed in us by the doctrine of the Gospel. It is, because he
   consecrated himself to the Father, that his holiness might come to us;
   for as the blessing on the first-fruits is spread over the whole
   harvest, so the Spirit of God cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and
   makes us partakers of it. Nor is this done by imputation only, for in
   that respect he is said to have been made to us righteousness; but he
   is likewise said to have been made to us sanctification, (1 Corinthians
   1:30,) because he has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in his
   own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit.
   Besides, though this sanctification belongs to the whole life of
   Christ, yet the highest illustration of it was given in the sacrifice
   of his death; for then he showed himself to be the true High Priest, by
   consecrating the temple, the altar, all the vessels, and the people, by
   the power of his Spirit.

   John 17:20-23

   20. And I ask not for these only, but for those also who shall believe
   on me through their word; 21. That all may be one; as thou, rather, art
   in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world
   may believe that thou hast sent me. 22. And I have given to them the
   glory which thou gavest to me; that they may be one, as we are one: 23.
   I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one; and that
   the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, [122]
   as thou hast loved me.


   20. And I ask not for these only. He now gives a wider range to his
   prayer, which hitherto had included the apostles alone; for he extends
   it to all the disciples of the Gospel, so long as there shall be any of
   them to the end of the world. This is assuredly a remarkable ground of
   confidence; for if we believe in Christ through the doctrine of the
   Gospel, we ought to entertain no doubt that we are already gathered
   with the apostles into his faithful protection, so that not one of us
   shall perish. This prayer of Christ is a safe harbour, and whoever
   retreats into it is safe from all danger of shipwreck; for it is as if
   Christ had solemnly sworn that he will devote his care and diligence to
   our salvation.

   He began with his apostles, that their salvation, which we know to be
   certain, might make us more certain of our own salvation; and,
   therefore, whenever Satan attacks us, let us learn to meet him with
   this shield, that it is not to no purpose that the Son of God united us
   with the apostles, so that the salvation of all was bound up, as it
   were, in the same bundle. There is nothing, therefore that ought more
   powerfully to excite us to embrace the Gospel; for as it is an
   inestimable blessing that we are presented to God by the hand of Christ
   to be preserved from destruction, so we ought justly to love it, and to
   care for it above all things else. In this respect the madness of the
   world is monstrous. All desire salvation; Christ instructs us in a way
   of obtaining it, from which if any one turn aside, there remains for
   him no good hope; and yet scarcely one person in a hundred deigns to
   receive what was so graciously offered.

   For those who shall believe on me, We must attend to this form of
   expression. Christ prays for all who shall believe in him. By these
   words he reminds us of what we have sometimes said already, that our
   faith ought to be directed to him. The clause which immediately
   follows, through their word, expresses admirably the power and nature
   of faith, and at the same time is a familiar confirmation to us who
   know that our faith is founded on the Gospel taught by the apostles.
   Let the world then condemn us a thousand times, this alone ought to
   satisfy us, that Christ acknowledges us to be his heritage and pleads
   with the Father for us.

   But woe to the Papists, whose faith is so far removed from this rule,
   that they are not ashamed to vomit out this horrid blasphemy, that
   there is nothing in Scripture but what is ambiguous, and may be turned
   in a variety of ways. The tradition of the Church is therefore their
   only authoritative guide to what they shall believe. But let us
   remember that the Son of God, who alone is competent to judge, does not
   approve of any other faith [123] than that which is drawn from the
   doctrine of the apostles, and sure information of that doctrine will be
   found no where else than in their writings.

   We must also observe that form of expression, to believe through the
   word, which means that faith springs from hearing, because the outward
   preaching of men is the instrument by which God draws us to faith. It
   follows, that God is, strictly speaking, the Author of faith, and men
   are the ministers by whom we believe, as Paul teaches (1 Corinthians
   3:5.)

   21. That all may be one. He again lays down the end of our happiness as
   consisting in unity, and justly; for the ruin of the human race is,
   that, having been alienated from God, it is also broken and scattered
   in itself. The restoration of it, therefore, on the contrary, consists
   in its being properly united in one body, as Paul declares the
   perfection of the Church to consist in

   believers being joined together in one spirit and says that apostles,
   prophets, evangelists, and pastors, were given, that they might edify
   and restore the body of Christ, till it came to the unity of faith; and
   therefore he exhorts believers to grow into Christ, who is the Head,
   from whom the whole body joined together, and connected by every bond
   of supply, according to the operation in the measure of every part,
   maketh increase of it to edifcation,
   (Ephesians 4:3, 11-16.)

   Wherefore, whenever Christ speaks about unity, let us remember how
   basely and shockingly, when separated from him, the world is scattered;
   and, next, let us learn that the commencement of a blessed life is,
   that we be all governed, and that we all live, by the Spirit of Christ
   alone.

   Again, it ought to be understood, that, in every instance in which
   Christ declares, in this chapter, that he is one with the Father, he
   does not speak simply of his Divine essence, but that he is called one
   as regards his mediatorial office, and in so far as he is our Head.
   Many of the fathers, no doubt, interpreted these words as meaning,
   absolutely, that Christ is one with the Father, because he is the
   eternal God. But their dispute with the Arians led them to seize on
   detached passages, and to torture them out of their natural meaning, in
   order to employ them against their antagonists. [124] Now, Christ's
   design was widely different from that of raising our minds to a mere
   speculation about his hidden Divinity; for he reasons from the end, by
   showing that we ought to be one, otherwise the unity which he has with
   the Father would be fruitless and unavailing. To comprehend aright what
   was intended by saying, that Christ and the Father are one, we must
   take care not to deprive Christ of his office as Mediator, but must
   rather view him as he is the Head of the Church, and unite him with his
   members. Thus will the chain of thought be preserved, that, in order to
   prevent the unity of the Son with the Father from being fruitless and
   unavailing, the power of that unity must be diffused through the whole
   body of believers. Hence, too, we infer that we are one with the Son of
   God; [125] not because he conveys his substance to us, but because, by
   the power of his Spirit, he imparts to us his life and all the
   blessings which he has received from the Father.

   That the world may believe. Some explain the word world to mean the
   elect, who, at that time, were still dispersed; but since the word
   world, throughout the whole of this chapter, denotes the reprobate, I
   am more inclined to adopt a different opinion. It happens that,
   immediately afterwards, he draws a distinction between all his people
   and the same world which he now mentions.

   The verb, to believe, has been inaccurately used by the Evangelist for
   the verb, to know; that is, when unbelievers, convinced by their own
   experience, perceive the heavenly and Divine glory of Christ. The
   consequence is, that, believing, they do not believe, because this
   conviction does not penetrate into the inward feeling of the heart. And
   it is a just vengeance of God, that the splendor of Divine glory
   dazzles the eyes of the reprobate because they do not deserve to have a
   clear and pure view of it. He afterwards uses the verb, to know in the
   same sense.

   22. And I have given to them the glory which thou gavest to me. Let it
   be observed here, that, while a pattern of perfect happiness was
   exhibited in Christ, he had nothing that belonged peculiarly to
   himself, but rather was rich, in order to enrich those who believed in
   him. Our happiness lies in having the image of God restored and formed
   anew in us, which was defaced by sin. Christ is not only the lively
   image of God, in so far as he is the eternal Word of God. but even on
   his human nature, which he has in common with us, the likeness of the
   glory of the Father has been engraved, so as to form his members to the
   resemblance of it. Paul also teaches us this, that

   we all, with unveiled face, by beholding THE GLORY OF GOD, are changed
   into the same image,
   (2 Corinthians 3:18.)

   Hence it follows, that no one ought to be reckoned among the disciples
   of Christ, unless we perceive the glory of God impressed on him, as
   with a seal, by the likeness of Christ. To the same purpose are the
   words which immediately follow:

   23. I in them, and thou in me; for he intends to teach that in him
   dwells all fullness of blessings, and that what was concealed in God is
   now manifested in him, that he may impart it to his people, as the
   water, flowing from the fountain by various channels, waters the fields
   on all sides.

   And hast loved them, [126] He means that it is a very striking
   exhibition, and a very excellent pledge, of the love of God towards
   believers, which the world is compelled to feel, whether it will or
   not, when the Holy Spirit dwelling in them sends forth the rays of
   righteousness and holiness. There are innumerable other ways, indeed,
   in which God daily testifies his fatherly love towards us, but the mark
   of adoption is justly preferred to them all. He likewise adds, and hast
   loved them, As Thou Hast Loved Me. By these words he intended to point
   out the cause and origin of the love; for the particle as, means
   because, and the words, AS thou hast loved me, mean, Because thou hast
   loved me; for to Christ alone belongs the title of Well-beloved,
   (Matthew 3:17; 17:5.) Besides, that love which the heavenly Father
   bears towards the Head is extended to all the members, so that he loves
   none but in Christ.

   Yet this gives rise to some appearance of contradiction; for Christ, as
   we have seen elsewhere [127] declares that the unspeakable love of God
   towards the world was the reason why he gave his only-begotten Son,
   (John 3:16.) If the cause must go before the effect, we infer that God
   the Father loved men apart from Christ; that is, before he was
   appointed to be the Redeemer. I reply, in that, and similar passages,
   love denotes the mercy with which God was moved towards unworthy
   persons, and even towards his enemies, before he reconciled them to
   himselfi It is, indeed, a wonderful goodness of God, and inconceivable
   by the human mind, that, exercising benevolence towards men whom he
   could not but hate, he removed the cause of the hatred, that there
   might be no obstruction to his love. And, indeed, Paul informs us that
   there are two ways in which we are loved in Christ; first, because the
   Father

   chose us in him before the creation of the world,
   (Ephesians 1:4;)

   and, secondly, because in Christ God hath reconciled us to himself, and
   hath showed that he is gracious to us, (Romans 5:10.) Thus we are at
   the same time the enemies and the friends of God, until, atonement
   having been made for our sins, we are restored to favor with God. But
   when we are justified by faith, it is then, properly, that we begin to
   be loved by God, as children by a father. That love by which Christ was
   appointed to be the person, in whom we should be fiercly chosen before
   we were born, and while we were still ruined in Adam, is hidden in the
   breast of God, and far exceeds the capacity of the human mind. True, no
   man will ever feel that God is gracious to him, unless he perceives
   that God is pacified in Christ. But as all relish for the love of God
   vanishes when Christ is taken away, so we may safely conclude that,
   since by faith we are ingrafted into his body, there is no danger of
   our falling from the love of God; for this foundation cannot be
   overturned, that we are loved, because the Father hath loved his Son.

   John 17:24-26

   24. Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me may also be with
   me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me;
   for thou lovedst me before the creation of the world. 25. Righteous
   Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these
   have known that thou hast sent me. 26. And I have declared to them thy
   name, and will declare it; that the love with which thou hast loved me
   may be in them, and I in them.


   24. Father, I will. To will is put for to desire; [129] for it
   expresses not a command but a prayer. But it may be understood in two
   ways; either that he wills that the disciples may enjoy his eternal
   presence, or, that God may, at length, receive them into the heavenly
   kingdom, to which he goes before them.

   That they may behold my glory. Some explain beholding his glory to
   mean, partaking of the glory which Christ has. Others explain it to be,
   to know by the experience of faith what Christ is, and how great is his
   majesty. For my own part, after carefully weighing the whole matter, I
   think that Christ speaks of the perfect happiness of believers, as if
   he had said, that his desire will not be satisfied till they have been
   received into heaven. In the same manner I explain the Beholding of the
   glory. At that time they saw the glory of Christ, just as a man shut up
   in the dark obtains, through small chinks, a feeble and glimmering
   light. Christ now wishes that they shall make such progress as to enjoy
   the full brightness of heaven. In short, he asks that the Father will
   conduct them, by uninterrupted progress, to the full vision of his
   glory.

   For thou lovedst me. This also agrees better with the person of the
   Mediator than with Christ's Divinity alone. It would be harsh to say
   that the Father loved his Wisdom; and though we were to admit it, the
   connection of the passage leads us to a different view. Christ,
   unquestionably, spoke as the Head of the Church, when he formerly
   prayed that the apostles might be united with him, and might behold the
   glory of his reign. He now says that the love of the Father is the
   cause of it; and, therefore, it follows that he was beloved, in so far
   as he was appointed to be the Redeemer of the world. With such a love
   did the Father love him before the creation of the world, that he might
   be the person in whom the Father would love his elect.

   25. Righteous Father. He compares his disciples to the world, so as to
   describe more fully the approbation and favour which they had received
   from the Father; for it is proper that they who alone know God, whom
   the whole world rejects, should be distinguished above others, and most
   properly does Christ plead with peculiar warmth for those whom the
   unbelief of the world did not prevent from acknowledging God. By
   calling him Righteous Father, Christ defies the world and its malice;
   as if he had said, "However proudly the world may despise or reject
   God, still it takes nothing from him, and cannot hinder the honor of
   his righteousness from remaining unimpaired." By these words he
   declares that the faith of the godly ought to be founded on God, in
   such a manner that, though the whole world should oppose, it would
   never fail; just as, in the present day, we must charge the Pope with
   injustice, in order that we may vindicate for God the praise which is
   due to him.

   But I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
   Christ does not merely say that God was known by the disciples, but
   mentions two steps; first, that he has known the Father; and, secondly,
   that the disciples have known that he was sent by the Father But as he
   adds immediately afterwards, that he has declared to them the name of
   the Father, he praises them, as I have said, for the knowledge of God,
   which separates them from the rest of the world. Yet we must attend to
   the order of faith, as it is here described. The Son came out of the
   bosom of the Father, and, properly speaking, he alone knows the Father;
   and, therefore, all who desire to approach God must betake themselves
   to Christ meeting them, and nmst devote themselves to him; and, after
   having been known by the disciples, he will, at length, raise them to
   God the Father.

   26. And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare it. Christ
   discharged the office of Teacher, but, in order to make known the
   Father, he employed the secret revelation of the Spirit, and not the
   sound of his voice alone. He means, therefore, that he taught the
   apostles efficaciously. Besides, their faith being at that time very
   weak, he promises greater progress for the future, and thus prepares
   them to expect more abundant grace of the Holy Spirit. Though he speaks
   of the apostles, we ought to draw from this a general exhortation, to
   study to make constant progress, and not to think that we have run so
   well that we have not still a long journey before us, so long as we are
   surrounded by the flesh.

   That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them; that is,
   that thou mayest love them in me, or, that the love with which thou
   hast loved me may be extended to them; for, strictly speaking, the love
   with which God loves us is no other than that with which he loved his
   Son from the beginning, so as to render us also acceptable to him, and
   capablc of being loved in Christ. And, indeed, as was said a little
   before, so far as relates to us, apart from Christ, we are hated by
   God, and he only begins to love us, when we are united to the body of
   his beloved Son. It is an invaluable privilege of faith, that we know
   that Christ was loved by the Father on our account, that we might be
   made partakers of the same love, and might enjoy it for ever.

   And I in them. This clause deserves our attention, for it teaches us
   that the only way in which we are included in that love which he
   mentions is, that Christ dwells in us; for, as the Father cannot look
   upon his Son without having likewise before his eyes the whole body of
   Christ, so, if we wish to be beheld in him, we must be actually his
   members.

   CHAPTER 18.
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 18:1-6

   1. When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples
   over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and
   his disciples. 2. And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place; for
   Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples. 3. Then Judas, having
   received a band of soldiers, and officers from the chief pricsts and
   Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons. 4. Now
   Jesus, knowing all the things which were coming upon him, went forward
   and said to them, Whom seek ye? 5. They answered him, Jesus of
   Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, It is I. And Judas also, who betrayed
   him, stood with them. 6. As soon therefore as he said to them, It is I,
   they went backward, and fell to the ground.


   1. When Jesus bad spoken these words. In this narrative John passes by
   many things which the other three Evangelists relate, and he does so on
   purposej as his intention was to collect many things worthy of being
   recorded, about which they say nothing; and, therefore, let the reader
   go to the other Evangelists to find what is wanting here.

   Over the brook Kedron. In the Greek original there is an article
   prefixed to Kedron, which would seem to intimate that the brook takes
   its name from the cedars; [130] but this is probably an error which has
   crept into the text; for the valley or brook Kedron is often mentioned
   in Scripture. The place was so called from its being dark or gloomy,
   because, being a hollow valley, it was shady, [131] on that point,
   however, I do not dispute: I only state what is more probable.

   The chief thing to be considered is, the intention of the Evangelist in
   pointing out the place; for his object was, to show that Christ went to
   death willingly. He came into a place which, he knew, was well known to
   Judas. Why did he do this but to present himself, of his own accord, to
   the traitor and to the enemies? Nor was he led astray by inadvertency,
   for he knew beforehand all that was to happen. John afterwards mentions
   also that he went forward to meet them. He therefore suffered death,
   not by constraint, but willingly, that he might be a voluntary
   sacrifice; for without obedience atonement would not have been obtained
   for us. Besides, he entered into the garden, not for the purpose of
   seeking a place of concealment, but that he might have a better
   opportunity, and greater leisure, for prayer. That he prayed three
   times to be delivered from death, (Matthew 26:44,) is not inconsistent
   with that voluntary obedience of which we have spoken; [132] for it was
   necessary that he should contend with difficulties, that he might be
   victorious. Now, having subdued the dread of death, he advances to
   death freely and willingly.

   3. Judas, therefore, having received a band of soldiers. That Judas
   came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a
   bad conscience, which always trembles without any cause. It is certain
   that the band of soldiers was borrowed from the governor, who also sent
   a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers; for, on account of sudden
   mutinies, a garrison was stationed in the city, and the governor
   himself kept a body-guard, wherever he was. The rest were officers sent
   by the priests; but John makes separate mention of the Pharisee,
   because they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared
   more about religion.

   4. Jesus therefore, hnowing. The Evangelist states more clearly with
   what readiness Christ went forward to death, but, at the same time,
   describes the great power which he exercised by a single word, in order
   to inform us that wicked men had no power over him, except so far as he
   gave permission.

   5. It is I. He replies mildly that he is the person whom they seek, and
   yet, as if they had been struck down by a violent tempest, or rather by
   a thunderbolt, he lays them prostrate on the ground. There was no want
   of power in him, therefore, to restrain their hands, if he had thought
   proper; but he wished to obey his Father, by whose decree he knew that
   he was called to die.

   We may infer from this how dreadful and alarming to the wicked the
   voicc of Christ will be, when he shall ascend his throne to judge the
   world. At that time he stood as a lamb ready to be sacrificed; his
   majesty, so far as outward appearance was concerned, was utterly gone;
   and yet when he utters but a single word, his armed and courageous
   enemies fall down. And what was the word? He thunders no fearful
   excommunication against them, but only replies, It is I What then will
   be the result, when he shall come, not to be judged by a man, but to be
   the Judge of the living and the dead; not in that mean and despicable
   appearance but shining in heavenly glory, and accompanied by his
   angels? He intended, at that time, to give a proof of that efficacy
   which Isaiah ascribes to his voice. Among other glorious attributes of
   Christ, the Prophet relates that

   he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
   and will slay the wicked by the breath of his lips,
   (Isaiah 11:4.)

   True, the fulfillment of this prophecy is declared by Paul to be
   delayed till the end of the world, (2 Thessalonians 2:8.) Yet we daily
   see the wicked, with all their rage and pride, struck down by the voice
   of Christ; and, when those men fell down who had come to bind Christ,
   there was exhibited a visible token of that alarm which wicked men feel
   within themselves, whether they will or not, when Christ speaks by his
   ministers. Besides, as this was in some measure accidental to the voice
   of Christ, to whom it peculiarly belongs to raise up men who were lying
   in a state of death, he will undoubtedly display toward us such power
   as to raise us even to heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [130] Is Kedron, a proper name, or an appellative? Calvin does not mean
   that the presence of the article settles this question, but that it
   depends on the preference which shall be given to one or another of the
   various readings. If we read ton Kedron, it will be difficult to resist
   the conclusion that Kedron is the genitive plural of Kedros, a cedar;
   but if we read tou Kedron, or rather, tou Kedron, we must treat Kedron,
   as an indeclinable Hebrew word, though Josephus chooses sometimes to
   decline it, as in the phrase, cheimarron Kedronos, the brook of Kedron,
   (Ant. 8:1.) "Instead of the common reading, ton Kedron," says
   Bloomfield, "four of the most ancient MSS. and six ancient Versions,
   with some Fathers, have,tou Kedron, which was preferred by Beza,
   Casaubon, Campbell, Castalio, Drusius, Lightfoot, Bols, Bynmus, Reland,
   and others of the best Commentators down to Middleton, Kuinoel, and
   Tittmann, and has been received by Bengel, Griesbach, Knapp, Vater, and
   Scholz. The common reading, however, is strenuously, but not
   satisfactorily, defended by Lampe and Matthsei." Our Author proceeds no
   further than to propose, tou instead of ton, as a conjectural
   emendation; but Bloomfield has given a prodigious list of authorities
   on the same side. -- Ed.

   [131] The Hebrew name qdrvn (Kidron) is derived from qdr, (Kadar,) it
   was black, and signifies the black brook. -- Ed.

   [132] On this point the reader will do well to consult our Author's
   elaborate exposition and argument, Harmony of the Evangelists, [10]vol.
   3, pp. 226-234.

   John 18:7-9

   7. He therefore asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
   Nazareth. 8. Jesus answered, I told you that it is I: if therefore you
   seek me, allow these to go away. 9. That the word which he had spoken
   might be fulfilled, Of those whom thou gavest to me I have lost none.


   7. He therefore asked them again. Hence it appears what is the powerful
   effect of that blindness with which God strikes the minds of wicked
   men, and how dreadful is their stupidity, when, by a just judgment of
   God, they have been bewitched by Satan. Oxen and asses, if they fall,
   are touched with some kind of feeling; but those men, after having had
   an open display of the divine power of Christ, proceed as fearlessly as
   if they had not perceived in him even the shadow of a man; nay, Judas
   himself remains unmoved. Let us learn, therefore, to fear the judgment
   of God, by which the reprobate, delivered into the hands of Satan,
   become more stupid than brute beasts. Nor can it be doubted that Satan
   hurried them on, with wild fury, to such a desperate hardihood; for
   there is no insanity that drives a man with such viohnee as this kind
   of blindness; Wicked men, after having been given over to a reprobate
   mind, (Romans 1:28,) care no more about rushing against God than if
   they had only to do with a fly. They feel his power, indeed, but not so
   as to be disposed to obey; for sooner will they be broken a hundred
   times than they will yield. In short, their malice is a veil to hinder
   them from observing the light of God; their obstinacy renders them
   harder than stones, so that they never suffer themselves to be subdued.

   8. I have told you that it is I. Here we see how the Son of God not
   only submits to death of his own accord, that by his obedience he may
   blot out our transgressions, but also how he discharges the office of a
   good Shepherd in protecting his flock. He sees the attack of the
   wolves, and does not wait till they come to the sheep which have been
   committed to his care, but immediately goes forward to guard them.
   Whenever, therefore, either wicked men or devils make an attack upon
   us, let us not doubt that this good Shepherd is ready [133] to aid us
   in the same manner. Yet by his example Christ has laid down to
   shepherds a rule which they ought to follow, if they wish to discharge
   their office in a right manner.

   9. I have lost none. This passage appears to be inappropriately quoted,
   as it relates to their souls rather than to their bodies; for Christ
   did not keep the apostles safe to the last, but this he accomplished,
   that, amidst incessant dangers, and even in the midst of death, still
   their eternal salvation was secured. I reply, the Evangelist does not
   speak merely of their bodily life, but rather means that Christ,
   sparing them for a time, made provision for their eternal salvation.
   Let us consider how great their weakness was; what do we think they
   would have done, if they had been brought to the test? While,
   therefore, Christ did not choose that they should be tried beyond the
   strength which he had given to them, he rescued them from eternal
   destruction. And hence we may draw a general doctrine, that, though he
   try our faith by many temptations, still he will never allow us to come
   into extreme danger without supplying us also with strength to
   overcome. And, indeed, we see how he continually bears with our
   weakness, when he puts himself forward to repel so many attacks of
   Satan and wicked men, because he sees that we are not yet able or
   prepared for them. In short, he never brings his people into the field
   of battle till they have been fully trained, so that even in perishing
   they do not perish, because there is gain provided for them both in
   death and in life.

   John 18:10-14

   10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high
   priest's servant, and cut off his right ear; and the servant's name was
   Malchus. 11. Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the
   sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which my Father hath given me? 12.
   Then the band, and the captain, and officers of the Jews, took Jesus,
   and bound him; 13. And led him away to Annas first; for he was
   father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest of that year. 14.
   And Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was
   expedient that one man should die for the people.


   10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it. The Evangelist now
   describes the foolish zeal of Peter, who attempted to defend his Master
   in an unlawful manner. Boldly and courageously, indeed, he incurs great
   risk on Christ's account; but as he does not consider what his calling
   demands, and what God permits, his action is so far from deserving
   praise, that he is severely blamed by Christ. But let us learn that, in
   the person of Peter, Christ condemns every thing that men dare to
   attempt out of their own fancy. This doctrine is eminently worthy of
   attention; for nothing is more common than to defend, under the cloak
   of zeal, every thing that we do, as if it were of no importance whether
   God approved, or not, what men suppose to be right, whose prudence is
   nothing else than mere vanity.

   If we saw nothing faulty in the zeal of Peter, still we ought to be
   satisfied on this single ground, that Christ declares that he is
   displeased with it. But we see that it was not owing to him that Christ
   did not turn aside from death, and that his name was not exposed to
   perpetual disgrace; for, in offering violence to the captain and the
   soldiers, he acts the part of a highwayman, because he resists the
   power which God has appointed. Christ having already been more than
   enough hated by the world, this single deed might give plausibility to
   all the calumnies which his enemies falsely brought against him.
   Besides, it was exceedingly thoughtless in Peter to attempt to prove
   his faith by his sword, while he could not do so by his tongue. When he
   is called to make confession, he denies his Master; and now, without
   his Master's authority, he raises a tumult.

   Warned by so striking an example, let us learn to keep our zeal within
   proper bounds; and as the wantonness of our flesh is always eager to
   attempt more than God commands, let us learn that our zeal will succeed
   ill, whenever we venture to undertake any thing contrary to the word of
   God. It will sometimes happen that the commencement gives us flattering
   promises, but we shall at length be punished for our rashness. Let
   obedience, therefore, be the foundation of all that we undertake. We
   are also reminded, that those who have resolved to plead the cause of
   Christ do not always conduct themselves so skilfully as not to commit
   some fault; and, therefore, we ought the more earnestly to entreat the
   Lord to guide us in every action by the spirit of prudence.

   11. Put up thy sword into the sheath. By this command Christ reproves
   Peter's action. But we must attend to the reason, which is, that a
   private individual was not permitted to rise in opposition to those who
   had been invested with public authority; for this may be inferred from
   the other three Evangelists, who relate Christ's general declaration,

   He who strikes with the sword shall perish by the sword,
   (Matthew 26:52.)

   We must also beware of repelling our enemies by force or violence, even
   when they unjustly provoke us, except so far as the institutions and
   laws of the community admit; for whoever goes beyond the limits of his
   calling, though he should gain the applause of the whole world, will
   never obtain for his conduct the approbation of God. [134]

   Shall I not drink the cup which my Father hath given to me? This
   appears to be a special reason why Christ ought to be silent, that he
   might be led as a lamb to be sacrificed, (Isaiah 53:7;) but it serves
   the purpose of an example, for the same patience is demanded from all
   of us. Scripture compares afflictions to medicinal draughts; for, as
   the master of a house distributes meat and drink to his children and
   servants, so God has this authority over us, that he has a right to
   treat every one as he thinks fit; and whether he cheers us by
   prosperity, or humbles us by adversity, he is said to administer a
   sweet or a bitter draught. The draught appointed for Christ was, to
   suffer the death of the cross for the reconciliation of the world. He
   says, therefore, that he must drink the cup which his Father measured
   out and delivered to him.

   In the same manner we, too, ought to be prepared for enduring the
   cross. And yet we ought not to listen to fanatics, who tell us that we
   must not seek remedies for diseases and any other kind of distresses,
   lest we reject the cup which the Heavenly Father [135] presents to us.
   Knowing that we must once die, (Hebrews 9:27,) we ought to be prepared
   for death; but the time of our death being unknown to us, the Lord
   permits us to defend our life by those aids which he has himself
   appointed. We must patiently endure diseases, however grievous they may
   be to our flesh; and though they do not yet appear to be mortal, we
   ought to seek alleviation of them; only we must be careful not to
   attempt any thing but what is permitted by the word of God. In short,
   provided that this remain always fixed in our hearts, Let the will of
   the Lord be done, (Acts 21:14,) when we seek deliveralice from the
   evils which press upon us, we do not fail to drink the cup which the
   Lord has given to us.

   12. Then the band of soldiers and the captain. It might be thought
   strange that Christ, who laid the soldiers prostrate on the ground by a
   single word, now allows himself to be taken; for if he intended at
   length to surrender to his enemies, what need was there for performing
   such a miracle? But the demonstration of divine power was advantageous
   in two respects; for, first, it serves to take away the offense, that
   we may not think that Christ yielded as if he had been overcome by
   weakness; and, secondly, it proves that in dying he was altogether
   voluntary. So far as it was useful, therefore, he asserted his power
   against his enemies; but when it was necessary to obey the Father, he
   restrained himself, that he might be offered as a sacrifice. But let us
   remember that the body of the Son of God was bound, that our souls
   might be loosed from the cords of sin and of Satan.

   13. And led him away to Annas first. The other Evangelists omit this
   circumstance, because it does not greatly affect the substance of the
   narrative; for nothing was done there that was worthy of being
   recorded. Perhaps the convenience of the place induced them to imprison
   Christ in the house of Annas, till the high priest assembled the
   council.

   The high priest of that year. He does not mean that the office of the
   high priesthood was annual, as many have falsely imagined, but that
   Caiaphas was high priest at that time, which appears plainly from
   Josephus. By the injunction of the Law, this honor was perpetual, and
   ended only at the death of him who held it; but ambition and intestine
   broils gave occasion to the Roman governors to dethrone one high priest
   and put another in his room, at their own pleasure, either for money or
   for favor. Thus Vitellius deposed Caiaphas, and appointed Jonathan, the
   son of Annas, to be his successor.

   14. Who had given counsel to the Jews. The Evangelist repeats the
   opinion of Caiaphas, which formerly came under our notice; [136] for
   God employed the foul mouth of a wicked and treacherous high priest to
   utter a prediction, (John 11:50,) just as he guided the tongue of the
   prophet Baham, contrary to his wish, so that he was constrained to
   bless the people, though he desired to curse them, to gain favor with
   king Balak, (Numbers 23:7, 8.)

   John 18:15-18

   15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple; [137] and
   that disciple was known to the high priest; therefore he went in with
   Jesus into the court of the high priest. 16. But Peter stood without at
   the door. The other disciple, therefore, who was known to the high
   priest, went out, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in
   Peter [138] 17. Then the maid that kept the door said to Peter, Art not
   thou also one of that man's disciples? He saith, I am not. 18. And the
   servants and officers, who had kindled a fire of coals, because it was
   cold, stood there and warmed themselves; and Simon Peter was also
   standing with them, and warming himself.


   15. And another disciple. Some have been led astray, by a slight
   conjecture, to suppose that this disciple was the Evangelist [139]
   John, because he is accustomed to speak of himself without mentioning
   his name. But what intimacy with a proud high priest could John have,
   who was a mean fisherman? And how was it possible for him, being one of
   Christ's household, to be in the habit of visiting the house of the
   high priest? It is more probable that he was not one of the twelve, but
   that he is called a disciple, because he had embraced the doctrine of
   the Son of God.

   John is not very exact in arranging the narrative, being satisfied with
   drawing up a brief summary; for, after having related that Peter once
   denied Christ, he intermingles other matters, and afterwards returns to
   the other two denials. Inattentive readers were led by this
   circumstance to conclude that the first denial took place in the house
   of Annas. The words, however, convey no such meaning, but rather state
   clearly that it was the high priest's maid that constrained Peter to
   deny Christ. We must, therefore, understand that, when Christ was
   brought before the high priest, admission was not granted to any person
   who chose, but that the disciple who was known to the high priest
   requested, as a personal favor, that Peter might be admitted. There is
   no reason to doubt that godly zeal was the motive that induced both of
   them to follow Christ; but since Christ had plainly declared that he
   spared Peter and the others, he who was so weak would have found it to
   be far better for him to groan and pray in some dark corner than to go
   into the presence of men. He now undertakes, with great earnestness,
   the performance of a duty from which Christ had released him; and when
   he comes to the confession of faith, in which he ought to have
   persevered even to death, his courage fails. We ought always to
   consider what the Lord requires from us, that those who are weak may
   not undertake what is not necessary.

   17. Then the maid that kept the door said to Peter. Peter is introduced
   into the high priest's hall; but it cost him very dear, for, as soon as
   he sets his foot within it, he is constrained to deny Christ. When he
   stumbles so shamefully at the first step, the foolishness of his
   boasting is exposed. He had boasted that he would prove to be a valiant
   champion, and able to meet death with firmness; and now, at the voice
   of a single maid, and that voice unaccompanied by threatening, he is
   confounded and throws down his arms. Such is a demonstration of the
   power of man. Certainly, all the strength that appears to be in men is
   smoke, which a breath immediately drives away. When we are out of the
   battle, we are too courageous; but experience shows that our lofty talk
   is foolish and groundless; and, even when Satan makes no attacks, we
   contrive for ourselves idle alarms which disturb us before the time.
   The voice of a feeble woman terrified Peter: and what is the case with
   us? Do we not continually tremble at the rustling of a falling leaf? A
   false appearance of danger, which was still distant, made Peter
   tremble: and are we not every day led away from Christ by childish
   absurdities? In short, our courage is of such a nature, that, of its
   own accord, it gives way where there is no enemy; and thus does God
   revenge the arrogance of men by reducing fierce minds to a state of
   weakness. A man, filled not with fortitude but with wind, promises that
   he will obtain an easy victory over the whole world; and yet, no sooner
   does he see the shadow of a thistle, than he immediately trembles. Let
   us therefore learn not to be brave in any other than the Lord.

   I am not. This does not seem, indeed, to be an absolute denial of
   Christ; but when Peter is afraid to acknowledge that he is one of
   Christs disciples, it amounts to an assertion that he has nothing to do
   with him. This ought to be carefully observed, that no one may imagine
   that he has escaped by acting the part of a sophist, when it is only in
   an indirect manner that he shrinks from the confession of his faith.

   18. And Simon Peter was standing with them. When the evangelist adds
   that Peter was standing near the fire, along with the others and
   servants, this serves to connect the various parts of the narrative, as
   we shall afterwards see. But this shows how great was Peter's
   stupidity, when, without the least concern, he warmed himself along
   with a multitude of wicked men, after having denied his Master; though
   it is possible that he may have been restrained by fear lest, in going
   out of the high priest's house, he should fall into another danger of
   the same kind.

   John 18:19-24

   19. The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and
   concerning his doctrine. 20. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly in the
   world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all
   the Jews assemble, and in secret I have spoken nothing. 21. Why askest
   thou me? Ask those who have heard what I have spoken to them: behold,
   they know what I have said. 22. When he had said these things, one of
   the officers that stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand,
   saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 23. Jesus answered him, If I
   have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest
   thou me? 24. Now Annas had sent him bound to Calaphas the high priest.


   19. The high priest then asked Jesus. The high priest interrogates
   Christ, as if he had been some seditious person, who had split the
   Church into parties by collecting disciples; and he interrogates him as
   if he had been a false prophet, who had endeavored to corrupt the
   purity of the faith by new and perverse doctrines. Our Lord [140] Jesus
   Christ, having completely and faithfully discharged the office of
   teacher, does not enter into a new defense; but, that he may not
   abandon the cause of truth, he shows that he was prepared to defend all
   that he had taught. Yet he likewise reproves the impudence of the high
   priest, who inquires about a matter perfectly well known, as if it had
   been doubtful. Not satisfied with having rejected the Redeemer offered,
   together with the salvation promised to them, they likewise condemn all
   the exposition of the Law.

   20. I spoke openly in the world. It is a childish error into which some
   have fallen, who think that this reply of Christ condemns those who
   expound the word of God in private apartments, when the tyranny of
   wieked men does not allow them to expound it publicly; for Christ does
   not argue as to what is lawful and what is not lawful, but his
   intention was to put down the insolent malice of Caiaphas.

   This passage, however, appears to be inconsistent with another saying
   of Christ, where he enjoins the apostles to

   proclaim on the house-tops what he had whispered in their ear,
   (Matthew 10:27;)

   and again, when he declares that

   it is not given to all to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
   (Matthew 13:14)

   and that he therefore confers this favor on none but the twelve
   apostles. I answer, when he says in the passage now under review, that
   he spoke nothing in secret, this refers to the substance of the
   doctrine, which was always the same, though the form of teaching it was
   various; for he did not speak differently among the disciples, so as to
   instruct them in something different; nor did he act cunningly, as if
   he purposely intended to conceal from the people what he spoke to a
   small number of persons in the house. He could, therefore, testify with
   a good conscience that he had openly declared and honestly proclaimed
   the substance of his doctrine.

   22. When he had said these things. This is added, in order to inform
   us, first, how great was the rage of the enemies of Christ, and how
   tyrannical their government was; and, secondly, what sort of discipline
   existed among those priests. They sit like judges, but they are as
   cruel as ferocious beasts. A council is assembled, in which the utmost
   gravity ought to have prevailed; and yet a single officer is so daring
   and presumptuous, that, in the midst of the judicial proceedings, and
   in the presence of the judges, he strikes the person accused, who was
   not found to be in any respect guilty. We need not wonder, therefore,
   that the doctrine of Christ is condemned by so barbarous an assembly,
   from which not only all justice, but likewise all humanity and modesty,
   are banished.

   23. If I have spoken evil. That is, "If I have sinned, accuse me, that,
   when the cause has been tried, I may be punished according to the
   offense; for this is not a lawful mode of procedure, but very different
   order and very different modesty ought to be maintained in judicial
   courts." Christ complains, therefore, that a grievous injury has been
   clone to him, if he has committed no offense, and that, even if he has
   committed an offense, still they ought to proceed in a lawful manner,
   and not with rage and violence.

   But Christ appears not to observe, in the present instance, the rule
   which he elsewhere lays down to his followers; for he does not

   hold out the right cheek to him who had struck him on the left,
   (Matthew 5:39.)

   I answer, in Christian patience it is not always the duty of him who
   has been struck to brook the injury done him, without saying a word,
   but, first, to endure it with patience, and, secondly, to give up all
   thoughts of revenge, and to endeavor to overcome evil by good, (Romans
   12:21.) Wicked men are already too powerfully impelled by the spirit of
   Satan to do injury to others, in order that nobody may provoke them. It
   is a foolish exposition of Christ's words, therefore, that is given by
   those who view them in such a light as if we were commanded to hold out
   fresh inducements to those who already are too much disposed to do
   mischief; for he means nothing else than that each of us should be more
   ready to bear a second injury than to take revenge for the first; so
   that there is nothing to prevent a Christian man from expostulating,
   when he has been unjustly treated, provided that his mind be free from
   rancour, and his hand from revenge.

   24. Now Annas had sent him bound. This sentence must be read by way of
   parenthesis; for, having said that Christ was taken to the house of
   Annas, and having continued his narrative, as if the assembly of the
   priests had been held there, the Evangelist now reminds the reader that
   Christ was taken from the house of Annas to the high priest's house.
   But as the tense of the Greek verb apesteile has led many people into a
   mistake, I have preferred translating it by the pluperfect tense, Had
   sent. [141]

   John 18:25-27

   25. And Simon Peter was standing there and warming, himself. They said
   therefore to him, Art not thou also one of his discipYes? He denied it?
   [142] and said, I am not. 26. One of the servants of the high priest,
   who was a kinsman of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did not I
   see thee in the garden with him? 27. Then Peter denied it again; [143]
   and immediately the cock crew.


   25. He denied it. How shocking the stupidity of Peter, who, after
   having denied his Master, not only has no feeling of repentance, but
   hardens himself by the very indulgence he takes in sinning! If each of
   them in his turn had asked him, he would not have hesitated to deny his
   Master a thousand times. Such is the manner in which Satan hurries
   along wretched men, after having degraded them. We must also attend to
   the circumstance which is related by the other Evangelists, (Matthew
   26:74; Mark 14:71,) that he began to curse and to swear, saying, that
   he did not know Christ. Thus it happens to many persons every day. At
   first, the fault will not be very great; next, it becomes habitual, and
   at length, after that conscience has been laid asleep, he who has
   accustomed himself to despise God will think nothing unlawful for him,
   but will dare to commit the greatest wickedness. There is nothing
   better for us, therefore, than to be early on our guard, that he who is
   tempted by Satan, while he is yet uncorrupted, may not allow himself
   the smallest indulgence.

   27. Immediately the coch crew. The Evangelist mentions the crowing of
   the coch, in order to inform us, that Peter was warned by God at the
   very time; and for this reason the other Evangelists tell us, that he
   then remembered the words of the Lord, (Matthew 26:75; Mark 14:72,)
   though Luke relates that the mere crowing of the cock did not produce
   any effect on Peter, till Christ looked at him, (Luke 22:61.) Thus,
   when any person has once begun to fall through the suggestions of
   Satan, no voice, no sign, no warning, will bring him back, until the
   Lord himself cast his eyes upon him.

   John 18:28-32

   28. Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the hall of the governor;
   [144] and it was early in the morning; and they themselves did not
   enter into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the
   passover [145] 29. Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What
   accusation do you bring against this man? 30. They answered and said to
   him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to
   thee. 31. Pilate therefore said to them, Take you him, and judge him
   according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, We are not
   allowed to put any man to death: 32. That the word of Jesus might be
   fulfilled, which he had spoken, signifying by what death he should die.


   28. Then they lead Jesus. That trial, which the Evangelist mentions,
   took place before daybreak; and yet there can be no doubt, that they
   had their bellows at work throughout the whole of the city to inflame
   the people. Thus the rage of the people was suddenly kindled, as if
   all, with one consent, demanded that Christ should be put to death,
   Now, the trial was conducted by the priests, not that they had it in
   their power to pronounce a sentence, but that, after having excited a
   prejudice against him by their previous decislon, they might deliver
   him to the governor, as if he had already been fully tried. [146] The
   Romans gave the name Praetorium both to the governor's house or palace,
   [147] and to the judgment-seat, where he was wont to decide causes.

   That they might not be defiled. In abstaining from all defilement,
   that, being purified according to the injunction of the Law, they may
   eat the Lord's Passover, their religion, in this respect, deserves
   commendation. But there are two faults, and both of them are very
   heinous. The first is, [148] they do not consider that they carry more
   pollution within their hearts, than they can contract by entering any
   place however profane; and the second is, they carry to excess their
   care about smaller matters, and neglect what is of the highest
   importance.

   To the defiled and to unbelievers, says Paul, nothing is pure;
   because their minds are polluted,
   (Titus 1:15.)

   But these hypocrites, though they are so full of malice, ambition,
   fraud, cruelty, and avarice, that they almost infect heaven and earth
   with their abominable smell, are only afraid of external pollutions. So
   then it is an intolerable mockery, that they expect to please God,
   provided that they do not contract defilement by touching some unclean
   thing, though they have disregarded true purity.

   Another fault connected with hypocrisy is, that, while it is careful in
   performing ceremonies, it makes no scruple of neglecting matters of the
   highest importance; for God enjoined on the Jews those ceremonies which
   are contained in the Law, for no other reason, than that they might be
   habituated to the love and practice of true holiness. Besides, no part
   of the Law forbade them to enter into the house of a Gentile, but it
   was a precaution derived from the traditions of the fathers, that no
   person might, through oversight, contract any pollution from an unclean
   house. But those venerable expounders of the Law, while they carefully
   strain at a gnat, swallow the camel [149] without any hesitation,
   (Matthew 23:24;) and it is usual with hypocrites to reckon it a greater
   crime to kill a flea than to kill a man. This fault is closely allied
   to the other, of greatly preferring the traditions of men to the holy
   commandments of God. In order that they may eat the passover in a
   proper manner, they wish to keep themselves pure; but they suppose
   uncleanness to be confined within the wails of the governor's house,
   and yet they do not hesitate, while heaven and earth are witnesses, to
   pursue an innocent person to death. In short, they observe the shadow
   of the passover with a false and pretended reverence, and yet not only
   do they violate the true passover by sacrilegious hands, but endeavor,
   as far as lies in their power, to bury it in eternal oblivion, [150]

   29. Pilate therefore went out to them. This heathen is not unwilling to
   encourage a superstition, which he ridicules and despises; but in the
   main point of the cause, he performs the duty of a good judge, when he
   orders them, if they have any accusation, to bring it forward. The
   priests, on the other hand, not having sufficient authority to condemn
   him whom they pronounce to be guilty, make no other reply, than that he
   ought to abide by their previous decision.

   30. If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to
   thee. They indirectly complain of Pilate, that he has not a proper
   reliance on their integrity. "Why do you not, without further concerns"
   say they, "hold it to be certain, that the person whom we prosecute
   deserves to die?" Such is the manner in which wicked men, whom God has
   raised to a high degree of honor, blinded as it were by their own
   greatness, allow themselves to do whatever they choose. Such, too, is
   the intoxicating nature of pride. [151] They wish that Christ should be
   reckoned a malefactor, and for no other reason [152] but because they
   accuse him. But if we come to the truth of the matter, what deeds of a
   malefactor shall we find in him, except that he has cured every kind of
   diseases, has driven the devils out of men, has made the paralytics and
   the lame to walk, has restored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf,
   and life to the dead? Such were the real facts, and those men knew them
   well; but, as I said a little ago, when men are intoxicated with pride,
   nothing is more difficult than to arouse them to form a sound and
   correct judgment.

   31. According to your law. Pilate, offended by their barbarous and
   violent proceedings, undoubtedly reproaches them by stating that this
   form of condemnation, which they were eager to carry into effcct, was
   at variance with the common law of all nations and with the feelings of
   mankind; and, at the same time he censures them for boasting that they
   had a law given to them by God.

   Take you him. He says this ironically; for he would not have allowed
   them to pronounce on a man a sentence of capital punishment; but it is
   as if he had said, "Were he in your power, he would instantly be
   executed, without being heard in his own defense; and, is this the
   equity of your Law, to condemn a man without any crime?" Thus do wicked
   men, falsely assuming the name of God as an excuse for their conduct,
   expose his holy doctrine to the reproaches of enemies, and the world
   eagerly seizes on it as an occasion of slander.

   We are not allowed. Those who think that the Jews refuse an offer,
   which Pilate had made to them, are mistaken; but rather, knowing that
   he had said to them in mockery, Take you him, they reply, "You would
   not allow it; and since you are the judge, execute your office."

   32. That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled. Finally, the Evangelist
   adds, that it was necessary that this should be done, in order that the
   prediction which Christ had uttered

   might be fulfilled, The Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of
   the Gentiles,
   (Matthew 20:19.)

   And, indeed, if we wish to read with advantage the history of Christ's
   death, the chief point is, to consider the eternal purpose of God. The
   Son of God is placed before the tribunal of a mortal man. If we suppose
   that this is done by the caprice of men, and do not raise our eyes to
   God, our faith must necessarily be confounded and put to shame. But
   when we perceive that by the condemnation of Christ, our condemnation
   before God is blotted out, because it pleased the Heavenly Father to
   take this method of reconciling mankind to himself, raised on high by
   this single consideration, we boldly, and without shame, glory even in
   Christ's ignominy. Let us therefore learn, in each part of this
   narrative, to turn our eyes to God as the Author of our redemption.

   John 18:33-36

   33. Then Pilate went again into the hall, and called Jesus, and said to
   him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 34. Jesus answered him, Sayest thou
   this from thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? 35. Pilate
   answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the priests have delivered
   thee to me: what hast thou done? 36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not
   of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have
   striven that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom
   is not from hence.


   33. Then Pilate went again into the hall. It is probable that many
   things were said on both sides, which the Evangelist passes over; and
   this conclusion might be readily drawn from the other Evangelists. But
   John dwells chiefly on a single point, that Pilate made a laborious
   inquiry whether Christ was justly or unjustly accused. In the presence
   of the people, who were inflamed with sedition, nothing could be done
   but in a riotous manner. He therefore goes again into the hall; and,
   indeed, his intention is to acquit Christ, but Christ himself, in order
   that he may obey his Father, presents himself to be condemned; and this
   is the reason why he is so sparing in his replies. Having a judge who
   was favorable, and who would willingly have lent an ear to him, it was
   not difficult for him to plead his cause; but he considers for what
   purpose he came down into the world, and to what he is now called by
   the Father. Of his own accord, therefore, he refrains from speaking,
   that he may not escape from death.

   Art thou the King of the Jews? It would never have struck Pilate's mind
   to put this question about the kingdom, if this charge had not been
   brought against Christ by the Jews. Now, Pilate takes up what was more
   offensive than all the rest, that, having disposed of it, he may acquit
   the prisoner. The tendency of Christ's answer is to show that there is
   no ground for that accusation; and thus it contains an indirect
   refutation; as if he had said, "It is absurd to bring that charge
   against me, for not even the slightest suspicion of it can fall upon
   me."

   Pilate appears to have taken amiss that Christ asked him why he
   suspected him of such a crime; [153] and, therefore, he angrily
   reproaches him, that all the evil comes from his own nation. "I sit
   here as a judge," says he; "it is not foreigners, but your own
   countrymen, who accuse you. There is no reason, therefore, why you
   should involve me in your quarrels. You would be allowed by me and by
   the Romans to live at peace; but you raise disturbances among
   yourselves, and I am reluctantly compelled to bear a part in them."

   36. My kingdom is not of this world. By these words he acknowledges
   that he is a king, but, so far as was necessary to prove his innocence,
   he clears himself of the calumny; for he declares, that there is no
   disagreement between his kingdom and political government or order;
   [154] as if he had said, "I am falsely accused, as if I had attempted
   to produce a disturbance, or to make a revolution in public affairs. I
   have preached about the kingdom of God; but that is spiritual, and,
   therefore, you have no right to suspect me of aspiring to kingly
   power." This defense was made by Christ before Pilate, but the same
   doctrine is useful to believers to the end of the world; for if the
   kingdom of Christ were earthly, it would be frail and changeable,
   because

   the fashion of this world passeth away,
   (1 Corinthians 7:31;)

   but now, since it is pronounced to be heavenly, this assures us of its
   perpetuity. Thus, should it happen, that the whole world were
   overturned, provided that our consciences are always directed to the
   kingdom of Christ, they will, nevertheless, remain firm, not only
   amidst shakings and convulsions, but even amidst dreadful ruin and
   destruction. If we are cruelly treated by wicked men, still our
   salvation is secured by the kingdom of Christ, which is not subject to
   the caprice of men. In short, thouglh there are innumerable storms by
   which the world is continually agitated, the kingdom of Christ, in
   which we ought to seek tranquillity, is separated from the world.

   We are taught, also, what is the nature of this kingdom; for if it made
   us happy according to the flesh, and brought us riches, luxuries, and
   all that is desirable for the use of the present life, it would smell
   of the earth and of the world; but now, though our condition be
   apparently wretched, still our true happiness remains unimpaired. We
   learn from it, also, who they are that belong to this kingdom; those
   who, having been renewed by the Spirit of God, contemplate the heavenly
   life in holiness and righteousness. Yet it deserves our attention,
   likewise, that it is not said, that the kingdom of Christ is not in
   this world; for we know that it has its seat in our hearts, as also
   Christ says elsewhere, The kingdom of God is within you, (Luke 17:21.)
   But, strictly speaking, the kingdom of God, while it dwells in us, is a
   stranger to the world, because its condition is totally different.

   My servants would strive. He proves that he did not aim at an earthly
   kingdom, because no one moves, no one takes arms in his support; for if
   a private individual lay claim to royal authority, he must gain power
   by means of seditious men. Nothing of this kind is seen in Christ; and,
   therefore, it follows that he is not an earthly king.

   But here a question arises, Is it not lawful to defend the kingdom of
   Christ by arms? For when Kings and Princes [155] are commanded to kiss
   the Son of God, (Psalm 2:10-12) not only are they enjoined to submit to
   his authority in their private capacity, but also to employ all the
   power that they possess, in defending the Church and maintaining
   godliness. I answer, first, they who draw this conclusion, that the
   doctrine of the Gospel and the pure worship of God ought not to be
   defended by arms, are unskillful and ignorant reasoners; for Christ
   argues only from the facts of the case in hand, how frivolous were the
   calumnies which the Jews had brought against him. Secondly, though
   godly kings defend the kingdom of Christ by the sword, still it is done
   in a different manner from that in which worldly kingdoms are wont to
   be defended; for the kingdom of Christ, being spiritual, must be
   founded on the doctrine and power of the Spirit. In the same manner,
   too, its edification is promoted; for neither the laws and edicts of
   men, nor the punishments inflicted by them, enter into the consciences.
   Yet this does not hinder princes from accidentally defending the
   kingdom of Christ; partly, by appointing external discipline, and
   partly, by lending their protection to the Church against wicked men.
   It results, however, from the depravity of the world, that the kingdom
   of Christ is strengthened more by the blood of the martyrs than by the
   aid of arms.

   John 18:37-40

   37. Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou then aking? Jesus answered,
   Thou sayest that I am a king. For this cause was I born, and for this
   cause came I into the world, that I may bear testimony to the truth:
   every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 38. Pilate saith to
   him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the
   Jews, and said to them, I find no guilt in him. 39. But you have a
   custom, that I should release to you some one at the passover; do you
   wish then that I should release to you the King of the Jews? 40. Then
   they all cried out again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now
   Barabbas was a robber.


   37. Thou sayest that I am a king. Although Pilate had already learned,
   from the former answer, that Christ claims for himself some sort of
   kingdom, yet now Christ asserts the same thing more firmly; and, not
   satisfied with this, he makes an additional statement, which serves for
   a seal, as it were, to ratify what he had said. Hence we infer, that
   the doctrine concerning Christ's kingdom is of no ordinary importance,
   since he has deemed it worthy of so solemn an affirmation.

   For this cause was I born, that I may bear witness to the truth. This
   is, no doubt, a general sentiment; but it must be viewed in relation to
   the place which it holds in the present passage. The words mean, that
   it is natural for Christ to speak the truth; and, next, that he was
   sent for this purpose by the Father; and, consequently, that this is
   his peculiar office. There is no danger, therefore, that we shall be
   deceived by trusting him, since it is impossible that he who has been
   commissioned by God, and whose natural disposition leads him to
   maintain the truth, shall teach any thing that is not true.

   Every one that is of the truth. Christ added this, not so much for the
   purpose of exhorting Pilate, (for he knew that he would gain nothing by
   doing so,) as of defending his doctrine against the base reproaches
   which had been cast on it; as if he had said, "It is imputed to me as a
   crime that I have asserted that I am a king; and yet this is an
   unquestionable truth, which is received with reverence and without
   hesitation by all who have a correct judgment and a sound
   understanding." When he says, that they are of the truth he does not
   mean that they naturally know the truth, but that they are directed by
   the Spirit of God.

   38. What is truth? Some think that Pilate puts this question through
   curiosity, as irreligious men are sometimes accustomed to be eagerly
   desirous of learning something that is new to them, and yet do not know
   why they wish it; for they intend nothing more than to gratify their
   ears. For my own part, I rather think that it is an expression of
   disdain; for Pilate thought himself highly insulted when Christ
   represented him as destitute of all knowledge of the truth. Here we see
   in Pilate a disease which is customary among men. Though we are all
   aware of our ignorance, yet there are few who are willing to confess
   it; and the consequence is, that the greater part of men reject the
   true doctrine. Afterwards, the Lord, who is the Teacher of the humble,
   blinds the proud, and thus inflicts on them the punishment which they
   deserve. From the same pride arises such disdain, that they do not
   choose to submit to learn, because all lay claim to sagacity and
   acuteness of mind. Truth is believed to be a common thing; but God
   declares, on the contrary, that it far exceeds the capacity of the
   human understanding.

   The same thing happens in other matters. The principal articles of
   theology are, the curse pronounced on the human race, the corruption of
   nature, the mortification of the flesh, the renewal of the life, the
   reconciliation effected by free grace through the only sacrifice, the
   imputation of righteousness, by means of which a sinner is accepted by
   God, and the illumination of the Holy Spirit. These, being paradoxes,
   are disdainfully rejected by the ordinary understanding of men. Few,
   therefore, make progress in the school of God, because we scarcely find
   one person in ten who attends to the first and elementary instructions;
   and why is this, but because they measure the secret wisdom of God by
   their own understanding?

   That Pilate spoke in mockery is evident from this circumstance, that he
   immediately goes out. In short, he is angry with Christ for boasting
   that he brings forward the truth, which formerly lay hidden in
   darkness. Yet this indignation of Pilate shows that wicked men never
   reject the doctrine of the Gospel so spitefully as not to be somewhat
   moved by its efficacy; for, though Pilate did not proceed so far as to
   become humble and teachable, yet he is constrained to feel some inward
   compunction.

   39. But you have a custom. Pilate was all along pondering in what way
   he might save Christ's life; but, the people being so fiercely enraged,
   he attempted to keep a middle path, in order to allay their fury; for
   he thought that it would be enough if Christ, being dismissed as a
   malefactor, were marked with perpetual ignominy. He therefore selects
   Barabbas above all others, in order that, by a comparison with that
   man, the hatred which they bore to Christ might be softened down; for
   Barabbas was universally and strongly detested on account of his
   atrocious crimes. And, indeed, is there any thing more detestable than
   a robber? But Luke (Luke 23:19) relates that, in addition to this, he
   was guilty of other crimes.

   That the Jews preferred him to Christ, did not happen without a
   singular interposition of the providence of God; for it would have been
   highly unbecoming, that the Son of God should be rescued from death by
   so dishonorable a price. Yet by his death, he was thrown into the
   deepest ignominy, so that, in consequence of the release of Barabbas,
   he was crucified between two robbers; for he had taken upon himself the
   sins of all, which could not be expiated in any other way; and the
   glory of his resurrection, by which it was speedily followed, caused
   his death itself to be a splendid triumph.

   This custom, by which the Roman governor delivered up to the Jews,
   every year, at the passover, some criminal, involved a base and heinous
   crime. It was done, no doubt in order to honor the sacredness of the
   day, but was, in reality, nothing else than a shameful profanation of
   it; for Scripture declares, that

   he who acquitteth the guilty is abomination in the sight of God,
   (Proverbs 17:15;)

   and therefore he is far from taking delight in that improper kind of
   forgiveness. Let us learn by this example, that nothing is more
   ridiculous, than to attempt to serve God by our inventions; for, as
   soon as men begin to follow their own imaginations, there will be no
   end till, by falling into some of the most absurd fooleries, they
   openly insult God. The rule for the worship of God, therefore, ought to
   be taken from nothing else than from his own appointment.

   CHAPTER 19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 19:1-6

   1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 2. And the
   soldiers, platting a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and put on
   him a purple robe, 3. And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and struck him
   with the palms of their hands. 4. Pilate therefore went out again, and
   said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I
   find no guilt in him. 5. Jesus then went out, wearing the crown of
   thorns and the purple robe. Then he said to them, [156] Behold the man!
   6. When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried
   out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take you
   him, and crucify him; for I find no guilt in him.


   1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus. Pilate adheres to his original
   intention; but to the former ignominy he adds a second, hoping that,
   when Christ shall have been scourged, the Jews will be satisfied with
   this light chastisement. When he labors so earnestly, and without any
   success, we ought to recognize in this the decree of Heaven, by which
   Christ was appointed to death. Yet his innocence is frequently attested
   by the testimony of the judge, in order to assure us that he was free
   from all sin, and that he was substituted as a guilty person in the
   room of others, and bore the punishment due to the sins of others. We
   see also in Pilate a remarkable example of a trembling conscience. He
   acquits Christ with his mouth, and acknowledges that there is no guilt
   in him, and yet inflicts punishment on him, as if he were guilty. Thus,
   they who have not so much courage as to defend, with unshaken
   constancy, what is right, must be driven hither and thither, and led to
   adopt opposite and conflicting opinions.

   We all condemn Pilate; and yet, it is shameful to relate that there are
   so many Pilates [157] in the world, who scourge Christ, not only in his
   members, but also in his doctrine. There are many who, for the purpose
   of saving the life of those who are persecuted for the sake of the
   Gospel, constrain them wickedly to deny Christ. What is this, but to
   expose Christ to ridicule, that he may lead a dishonorable life? Others
   select and approve of certain parts of the Gospel, and yet tear the
   whole Gospel to pieces. They think that they have done exceedingly
   well, if they have corrected a few gross abuses. It would be better
   that the doctrine should be buried for a time, than that it should be
   scourged in this manner, for it would spring up again ill spite of the
   devil and of tyrants; but nothing is more difficult than to restore it
   to its purity after having been once corrupted.

   2. And the soldiers, platting a crown of thorns. This was
   unquestionably done by the authority of Pilate, in order to affix a
   mark of infamy on the Son of God, for having made himself a king; and
   that in order to satisfy the rage of the Jews, as if he had been
   convinced that the accusations which they brought against Christ were
   well founded. Yet the wickedness and insolence of the soldiers is
   indulged more freely than had been ordered by the judge; as ungodly men
   eagerly seize on the opportunity of doing evil whenever it is offered
   to them. But we see here the amazing cruelty of the Jewish nation,
   [158] whose minds are not moved to compassion by so piteous a
   spectacle; but all this is directed by God, in order to reconcile the
   world to himself by the death of his Son.

   6. Take you him. He did not wish to deliver Christ into their hands, or
   to abandon him to their fury; only he declares that he will not be
   their executioner. This is evident from the reason immediately added,
   when he says that he finds no guilt in him; as if he had said, that he
   will never be persuaded to shed innocent blood for their gratification.
   That it is only the priests and officers who demand that he shall be
   crucified, is evident from the circumstance that the madness of the
   people was not so great, except so far as those bellows contributed
   afterwards to kindle it.

   John 19:7-11

   7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law he
   ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 8. When therefore
   Pilate heard this saying, he was the more afraid; 9. And went again
   into the hall, and said to Jesus, Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him
   no answer. 10. Then Pilate said to him, Speakest thou not to me?
   Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to
   release thee? 11. Jesus answered, Thou wouldest have no power against
   me, unless it were given to thee from above; therefore he who hath
   delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.


   7. We have a law. They mean that, in proceeding against Christ, they do
   what is right, and are not actuated by hatred or sinful passion; for
   they perceived that Pilate had indirectly reproved them. Now, they
   speak as in the presence of a man who was ignorant of the law; as if
   they had said, "We are permitted to live after our own manner, and our
   religion does not suffer any man to boast of being the Son of God."
   Besides, this accusation was not altogether void of plausibility, but
   they erred grievously in the application of it. The general doctrine
   was undoubtedly true, that it was not lawful for men to assume any
   honor which is due to God, and that they who claimed for themselves
   what is peculiar to God alone deserved to be put to death. But the
   source of their error related to the person of Christ, because they did
   not consider what are the titles given by Scripture to the Messiah,
   from which they might easily have learned that he was the Son of God,
   and did not even deign to inquire whether or not Jesus was the Messiah
   whom God had formerly promised.

   We see, then, how they drew a false conclusion from a true principle,
   for they reason badly. This example warns us to distinguish carefully
   between a general doctrine and the application of it, [159] for there
   are many ignorant and unsteady persons who reject the very principles
   of Scripture, if they have once been deceived by the semblance of
   truth; and such licentiousness makes too great progress in the world
   every day. Let us, therefore, remember that we ought to guard against
   imposition, so that principles which are true may remain in all their
   force, and that the authority of Scripture may not be diminished.

   On the other hand, we may easily find a reply to wicked men, who
   falsely and improperly allege the testimony of Scripture, and the
   principles which they draw from it, to support their bad designs; just
   as the Papists, when they extol in lofty terms the authority of the
   Church, bring forward nothing about which all the children of God are
   not agreed. They maintain that the Church is the mother of believers,
   that she is the pillar of truth, that she ought to be heard, that she
   is guided by the Holy Spirit. [160] All this we ought to admit, but
   when they wish to appropriate to themselves all the authority that is
   due to the Church, they wickedly, and with sacrilegious presumption,
   seize what does not at all belong to them. For we must inquire into the
   grounds of what they assume as true, that they deserve the title of The
   Church; and here they utterly fail. In like manner, when they exercise
   furious cruelty against all the godly, they do so on this pretence,
   that they have been ordained to defend the faith and peace of the
   Church. But when we examine the matter more closely, we plainly see
   that there is nothing which they have less at heart than the defense of
   true doctrine, that nothing affects them less than a care about peace
   and harmony, but that they only fight to uphold their own tyranny. They
   who are satisfied with general principles, and do not attend to the
   circumstances, imagine that the Papists do right in attacking us; but
   the investigation of the matter quickly dissipates that smoke by which
   they deceive the simple. [161]

   8. He was the more afraid. These words may be explained in two ways.
   The first is, that Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to
   him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ. The second
   is, that, after having heard the name of the Son of God, his mind was
   moved by religion. This second view is confirmed by what immediately
   follows:

   9. And he entered again into the hall, and said to Jesus; Whence Art
   Thou? It is evident from this that he was in a state of perplexity and
   anguish, because he was afraid that he would be punished for sacrilege,
   if he laid his hand on the Son of God It ought to be observed that,
   when he asks whence Christ is, he does not inquire about his country,
   but the meaning is, as if he had said, "Art thou a man born on the
   earth, or art thou some god?" The interpretation which I give to this
   passage, therefore, is, that Pilate, struck with the fear of God, was
   in perplexity and doubt as to what he ought to do; [162] for he saw, on
   the one hand, the excitement of a mutiny, and, on the other hand,
   conscience held him bound not to offend God for the sake of avoiding
   danger.

   This example is highly worthy of observation. Though the countenance of
   Christ was so disfigured, yet, as soon as Pilate hears the name of God,
   he is seized with the fear of violating the majesty of God in a man who
   was utterly mean and despicable. If reverence for God had so much
   influence on an irreligious man, must not they be worse than reprobate,
   who now judge of divine things in sport and jest, carelessly, and
   without any fear? for, indeed, Pilate is a proof that men have
   naturally a sentiment of religion, which does not suffer them to rush
   fearlessly in any direction they choose, when the question relates to
   divine things. This is the reason why I said that those who, in
   handling the doctrine of Scripture, are not more impressed with the
   majesty of God, than if they had been disputing about the shadow of an
   ass, are given up to a reprobate mind, (Romans 1:28.) Yet they will one
   day feel to their destruction, what veneration is due to the name of
   God, which they now treat with such disdainful and outrageous mockery.
   It is shocking to relate how haughtily the Papists condemn the plain
   and ascertained truth of God, and with what cruelty they shed innocent
   blood. Whence, I beseech you, comes that drunken stupidity, but because
   they do not recollect that they have anything to do with God?

   And Jesus gave him no answer. We ought not to think it strange that
   Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly
   mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause,
   -- as is customary with persons accused who are desirous to be
   acquitted, -- but rather to suffer condemnation; for it was proper that
   he should be condemned, when he appeared in our room. This is the
   reason why he makes no defense; and yet Christ's silence is not
   inconsistent with what Paul says,

   Remember that Christ, before Pilate, made a good confession,
   (1 Timothy 6:13;)

   for there he maintained the faith of the Gospel, as far as was
   necessary, and his death was nothing else than the sealing of the
   doctrine delivered by him. Christ left nothing undone of what was
   necessary to make a lawful confession, but he kept silence as to asking
   an acquittal. Besides, there was some danger that Pilate would acquit
   Christ as one of the pretended gods, as Tiberius wished to rank him
   among the gods of the Romans. Justly, therefore, does Christ, by his
   silence, frown on this foolish superstition.

   10. Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee? This shows that
   the dread with which Pilate had been suddenly seized was transitory,
   and had no solid root; for now, forgetting all fear, he breaks out into
   haughty and monstrous contempt of God. He threatens Christ, as if there
   had not been a Judge in heaven; but this must always happen with
   irreligious men, that, shaking off the fear of God, they quickly return
   to their natural disposition. Hence also we infer, that it is not
   without good reason that the heart of man is called deceitful,
   (Jeremiah 17:9;) for, though some fear of God dwells in it, there
   likewise comes from it mere impiety. Whoever, then, is not regenerated
   by the Spirit of God, though he pretend for a time to reverence the
   majesty of God, will quickly show, by opposite facts, that this fear
   was hypocritical.

   Again, we see in Pilate an image of a proud man, who is driven to
   madness by his ambition; for, when he wishes to exalt his power, he
   deprives himself of all praise and reputation for justice. He
   acknowledges that Christ is innocent, and therefore he makes himself no
   better than a robber, when he boasts that he has power to cut his
   throat! Thus, wicked consciences, in which faith and the true knowledge
   of God do not reign, must necessarily be agitated, and there must be
   within them various feelings of the flesh, which contend with each
   other; and in this manner God takes signal vengeance on the pride of
   men, when they go beyond their limits, so as to claim for themselves
   infinite power. By condemning themselves for injustice, they stamp on
   themselves the greatest reproach and disgrace. No blindness, therefore,
   is greater than that of pride; and we need not wonder, since pride
   feels the hand of God, against which it strikes, to be armed with
   vengeance. Let us therefore remember, that we ought not rashly to
   indulge in foolish boastings, lest we expose ourselves to ridicule; and
   especially that those who occupy a high rank ought to conduct
   themselves modestly, and not to be ashamed of being subject to God and
   to his laws.

   11. Thou wouldest have no power. Some explain this in a general sense,
   that nothing is done in the world but by the permission of God; as if
   Christ had said, that Pilate, though he thinks that he can do all
   things, will do nothing more than God permits. The statement is, no
   doubt, true, that this world is regulated by the disposal of God, and
   that, whatever may be the efforts of wicked men, still they cannot even
   move a finger but as the secret power of God directs. But I prefer the
   opinion of those who confine this passage to the office of the
   magistrate; for by these words Christ rebukes the foolish boasting of
   Pilate, in extolling himself, as if his power had not been from God; as
   if he had said, Thou claimest every thing for thyself', as if thou
   hadst not to render an account one day to God; but it was not without
   His providence that thou wast made a judge. Consider, then, that His
   heavenly throne is far higher than thy tribunal. It is impossible to
   find any admonition better fitted to repress the insolence of those who
   rule over others, that they may not abuse their authority. The father
   imagines that he may do what he pleases towards his children, the
   husband towards his wife, the master towards his servants, the prince
   towards his people, unless when they look to God, who hath determined
   that their authority shall be limited by a fixed rule.

   Therefore he who delivered me to thee. Some think that this declares
   the Jews to be more guilty than Pilate, because, with wicked hatred and
   malicious treachery, they are enraged against an innocent man, that is,
   those of them who were private individuals, and not clothed with lawful
   authority. But I think that this circumstance renders their guilt more
   heinous and less excusable on another ground, that they constrain a
   divinely appointed government to comply with their lawless desires; for
   it is a monstrous sacrilege to pervert a holy ordinance of God for
   promoting any wickedness. The robber, who, with his own hand, cuts the
   throat of a wretched passenger, is justly held in abhorrence; but he
   who, under the forms of a judicial trial, puts to death an innocent
   man, is much more wicked. Yet Christ does not aggravate their guilt,
   for the purpose of extenuating that of Pilate; for he does not
   institute a comparison between him and them, but rather includes them
   all in the same condemnation, because they equally pollute a holy
   power. There is only this difference, that he makes direct attack on
   the Jews, but indirectly censures Pilate, who complies with their
   wicked desire.

   [159] "Entre la doctrine generale et l'application d'icelle."

   [160] These statements regarding "The Church" our Author considers to
   be what logicians call the major proposition of the syllogism; and by
   the Latin word "hypothesis" rendered in French "l'application," he
   evidently means the minor proposition, which he declares not only to be
   unsupported by proof, but to be utterly false. His own early training
   and habits, as a lawyer, naturally led him to throw the argument into
   this form, especially when it related to a criminal prosecution; for
   even in our own times indictments invariably take the form of a
   syllogism. He appears to have conceived the accusation against Christ
   to run thus: "Any mere man, declaring himself to be the Son of God, is
   guilty of blasphemy, and deserves to die. But Jesus of Nazareth, who is
   a mere man, hath made himself to be the Son of God. Therefore,
   according to our law, Jesus ought to die." The major proposition
   cannot, be questioned, being manifestly taken from the law of Moses.
   The minor proposmon consists of two parts. 1. Jesus is a mere man. 2.
   Jesus hath made himself to be the Son of God. The second part is true,
   but the first is false; and, consequently, the whole argument,
   plausible as it had seemed, falls to the ground. It ought to have been
   known and acknowledged by the Jews, that the honorable rank of the Son
   of God, though it could not without blasphemy be claimed by a mere
   child of Adam, belonged of right to Jesus of Nazareth, of whom, even
   before his birth, the angel said to the Virgin Mary, That holy thing
   which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God, (Luke
   1:35.)

   John 19:12-16

   12. From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried
   out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend:
   whoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 13. When Pilate,
   therefore, had heard this saying, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on
   the judgment-seat, in a place which is called the Stone-pavement, and
   in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14. And it was the preparation of the passover,
   about the sixth hour; and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King! [163]
   15. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
   Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests
   answered, We have no king but Caesar. 16. Then, therefore, he delivered
   him to them to be crucified; and they took Jesus, and led him away.


   12. From that time Pilate sought to release him. Though Pilate does not
   conduct himself conscientiously, and is actuated more by ambition than
   by a regard to justice, and, on that account, is wretchedly irresolute,
   yet his modesty is commendable on this ground, that, when he is
   severely reproved by Christ, he does not fly into a passion, but, on
   the contrary, is still more disposed to release him. He is a judge, and
   yet he meekly permits the accused person to be his reprover; and,
   indeed, scarcely one person in a hundred will be found, who so mildly
   suffers a reproof, even from one who is his equal.

   Thou art not Caesar's friend. By threats they prevail on Pilate to
   condemn Christ; for they could do nothing that was more hateful, or
   more fitted to produce terror, than to hold him suspected of disloyalty
   to Caesar. "Thou showest," say they, "that thou dost not care about
   Caesar's authority, if thou acquit him who has endeavored to throw
   every thing into confusion." This wickedness at length broke down the
   resolution of Pilate, who, till now, had only been shaken by their
   furious clamours. Nor is it without a good reason that the Evangelist
   so laboriously examines and details those circumstances; for it is of
   great importance to us to know, that Pilate did not condemn Christ,
   before he had several times acquitted him with his own mouth, in order
   that we may learn from it, that it was for our sins that he was
   condemned, and not on his own account. We may also learn from it, how
   voluntarily he offered himself to die, when he disdained to avail
   himself of the favorable disposition of the judge towards him; and,
   indeed, it was this obedience that caused his death to be a sacrifice
   of sweet savour, (Ephesians 5:2,) for blotting out all sins.

   13. And sat down on the judgment-seat. Hence we see what conflicting
   opinions passed through the mind of Pilate, as if he had been a
   stage-player who was acting two characters. He ascends the
   judgment-seat, in order to pronounce sentence of death on Christ
   solemnly, and in the customary form; [164] and yet he declares openly,
   that he does so reluctantly and against his conscience. When he calls
   Christ king, he speaks ironically, meaning that it was a trivial charge
   which the Jews brought against him; or rather, for the purpose of
   allaying their fury, he warns them, that it would bring disgrace on the
   whole nation, if a report were spread abroad, that a person of that
   nation had been condemned to die for aspiring to kingly power.

   In the place which is called the Stone-pavement, but in the Hebrew,
   Gabbatha. When the Evangelist says, that gvt' (Gabbatha) was the name
   of the place in Hebrew he means the Chaldaic or Syriac language, which
   was then in common use; for in Hebrew, gvh(Gabach) means to be lofty.
   It was proper, therefore, that Christ should be condemned from a lofty
   place, that he, coming from heaven as the supreme Judge, may acquit us
   at the last day.

   14. About the sixth hour. The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to
   contradict each other, in the computation of time. The other three
   Evangelists say that the darkness came on about the sixth hour, while
   Christ was hanging on the cross, (Matthew 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke
   23:44.) Mark, too says expressly that it was the third hour when the
   sentence was pronounced on him, (Mark 15:25.) But this may be easily
   explained. It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at
   that time divided into four parts, as the night also contained four
   watches; in consequence of which, the Evangelists sometimes allot not
   more than four hours to each day, and extend each hour to three, and,
   at the same time, reckon the space of an hour, which was drawing to a
   close, as belonging to the next part. According to this calculation,
   John relates that Christ was condemned about the sixth hour, because
   the time of the day was drawing towards the sixth hour, or towards the
   second part of the day. Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or
   about the sixth hour; for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions, (John
   19:20,) the place was near to the city. The darkness began between the
   sixth and ninth hour, and lasted till the ninth hour, at which time
   Christ died.

   15. We have no king but Caesar. This is a display of shocking madness,
   that the priests, who ought to have been well acquainted with the Law,
   reject Christ, in whom the salvation of the people was wholly
   contained, on whom all the promises depended, and on whom the whole of
   their religion was founded; and, indeed, by rejecting Christ, they
   deprive themselves of the grace of God and of every blessing. We see,
   then, what insanity had seized them. Let us suppose that Jesus Christ
   was not the Christ; [165] still they have no excuse for acknowledging
   no other king but Caesar. For, first, they revolt from the spiritual
   kingdom of God; and, secondly, they prefer the tyranny of the Roman
   Empire, which they greatly abhorred, to a just government, such as God
   had promised to them. Thus wicked men, in order to fly from Christ, not
   only deprive themselves of eternal life, but draw down on their heads
   every kind of miseries. On the other hand, the sole happiness of the
   godly is, to be subject to the royal authority of Christ, whether,
   according to the flesh, they are placed under a just and lawful
   government, under the oppression of tyrants.

   16. Then, therefore, he delivered him to them to be crucified. Pilate
   was, no doubt constrained by their importunity to deliver Christ; and
   yet this was not done in a tumultuous manner, but he was solemnly
   condemned in the ordinary form, because there were also two robbers
   who, after having been tried, were at the same time condemned to be
   crucified. But John employs this expression, in order to make it more
   fully evident that Christ, though he had not been convicted of any
   crime, was given up to the insatiable cruelty of the people.

   John 19:17-22

   17. And he, bearing his cross, went forth to a place which is called
   (the place) of a Skull, and: in Hebrew, Golgotha; [166] 18. Where they
   crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus
   in the midst. 19. And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the
   cross; and it was written, Jesus of Nazareth, The King Of The Jews ·20.
   This title then many of the Jews read, because the place where Jesus
   was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and
   Greek, and Latin· 21. The chief priests of the Jews, therefore, said to
   Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King,
   of the Jews. 22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.


   17. He went forth to a place. The circumstances which are here related
   contribute greatly, not only to show the truth of the narrative, but
   likewise to build up our faith. We must look for righteousness through
   the satisfaction made by Christ. To prove that he is the sacrifice for
   our sins, he wished both to be led out of the city, and to be hanged on
   a tree; for the custom was, in compliance with the injunction of the
   Law, that the sacrifices, the blood of which was shed for sin, were
   carried out of the camp, (Leviticus 6:30; 16:27;) and the same Law
   declares that

   he who hangeth on a tree is accursed,
   (Deuteronomy 21:23.)

   Both were fulfilled in Christ, that we might be fully convinced that
   atonement has been made for our sins by the sacrifice of his death;
   that

   he was made subject to the curse, in order that he might redeem us from
   the curse of the law,
   (Galatians 3:13;)

   that

   he was made sin, in order that we might be the righteousness of God in
   him,
   (2 Corinthians 5:21;)

   that he was led out of the city, in order that he might carry with him,
   and take away, our defilements which were laid on him, (Hebrews 12:12.)
   To the same purpose is the statement about the robbers, which
   immediately follows: --

   18. And two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the
   midst. As if the severity of the punishment had not been sufficient of
   itself, he is hanged in the midst between two robbers, as if he not
   only had deserved to be classed with other robbers, but had been the
   most wicked and the most detestable of them all. We ought always to
   remember, that the wicked executioners of Christ did nothing but what
   had been determined by the hand and purpose of God; [167] for God did
   not surrender his Son to their lawless passions, but determined that,
   according to his own will and good pleasure, he should be offered as a
   sacrifice. And if there were the best reasons for the purpose of God in
   all those things which he determined that his Son should suffer, we
   ought to consider, on the one hand, the dreadful weight of his wrath
   against sin, and, on the other hand, his infinite goodness towards us.
   In no other way could our guilt be removed than by the Son of God
   becoming a curse for us. We see him driven out into an accursed place,
   as if he had been polluted by a mass of all sorts of crimes, that there
   he might appear to be accursed before God and men. Assuredly we are
   prodigiously stupid, if we do not plainly see in this mirror with what
   abhorrence God regards sin; and we are harder than stones, if we do not
   tremble at such a judgment as this.

   When, on the other hand, God declares that our salvation was so dear to
   him, that he did not spare his only-begotten Son, what abundant
   goodness and what astonishing grace do we here behold! Whoever, then,
   takes a just view of the causes of the death of Christ, together with
   the advantage which it yields to us, will not, like the Greeks, regard
   the doctrlne of the cross as foolishness, nor, like the Jews, will he
   regard it as an offense, (1 Corinthians 1:23,) but rather as an
   invaluable token and pledge of the power, and wisdom, and
   righteousness, and goodness of God.

   When John says, that the name of the place was Golgotha, he means that,
   in the Chaldaic or Syriac language, it was called glglt', (Gulgaltha.)
   The name is derived from glgl, (Gilgel, [168] ) which signifies, to
   roll; because a skull is round like a ball or globe. [169]

   19. And Pilate wrote also a title. The Evangelist relates a memorable
   action of Pilate, after having pronounced the sentence. It is perhaps
   true that it was customary to affix titles, when malefactors were
   executed, that the cause of the punishment might be known to all, and
   might serve the purpose of an example. But in Christ there is this
   extraordinary circumstance, that the title which is affixed to him
   implies no disgrace; for Pilate's intention was, to avenge himself
   indirectly on the Jews, (who, by their obstinacy, had extorted from him
   an unjust sentence of death on an innocent man,) and, in the person of
   Christ, to throw blame on the whole nation. Thus he does not brand
   Christ with the commission of any crime.

   But the providence of God, which guided the pen of Pilate, had a higher
   object in view. It did not, indeed, occur to Pilate to celebrate Christ
   as the Author of salvation, and the Nazarene of God, and the King of a
   chosen people; but God dictated to him this commendation of the Gospel,
   though he knew not the meaning of what he wrote. It. was the same
   secret guidance of the Spirit that caused the title to be published in
   three languages; for it is not probable that this was an ordinary
   practice, but the Lord showed, by this preparatory arrangement, that
   the time was now at hand, when the name of his Son should be made known
   throughout the whole earth.

   21. The chief priests of the Jews said therefore to Pilate. They feel
   that they are sharply rebuked; and, therefore, they would wish that the
   title were changed, so as not to involve the nation in disgrace, but to
   throw the whole blame on Christ. But yet they do not conceal their deep
   hatred of the truth, since the smallest spark of it is more than they
   are able to endure. Thus Satan always prompts his servants to endeavor
   to extinguish, or, at least, to choke, by their own darkness, the light
   of God, as soon as the feeblest ray of it appears.

   22. What I have written I have written. Pilate's firmness must be
   ascribed to the providence of God; for there can be no doubt that they
   attempted, in various ways, to change his resolution. Let us know,
   therefore, that he was held by a Divine hand, so that he remained
   unmoved. Pilate did not yield to the prayers of the priests, and did
   not allow himself to be corrupted by them; but God testified, by his
   mouth, the firmness and stability of the kingdom of his Son. And if, in
   the writing of Pilate, the kingdom of Christ was shown to be so firm
   that it could not be shaken by all the attacks of its enemies, what
   value ought we to attach to the testimonies of the Prophets, whose
   tongues and hands God consecrated to his service?

   The example of Pilate reminds us, also, that it is our duty to remain
   steady in defending the truth. A heathen refuses to retract what he has
   justly and properly written concerning Christ, though he did not
   understand or consider what he was doing. How great, then, will be our
   dishonor, if, terrified by threatenigs or dangers, we withdraw from the
   profession of his doctrine, which God hath sealed on our hearts by his
   Spirit! Besides, it ought to be observed how detestable is the tyranny
   of the Papists, which prohibits the reading of the Gospel, and of the
   whole of the Scripture, by the common people. Pilate, though he was a
   reprobate man, and, in other respects, an instrument of Satan, was
   nevertheless, by a secret guidance, appointed to be a herald of the
   Gospel, that he might publish a short summary of it in three languages.
   What rank, therefore, shall we assign to those who do all that they can
   to suppress the knowledge of it, since they show that they are worse
   than Pilate?

   John 19:23-24

   23. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
   garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part. They took also
   his coat. [170] But the coat was without seam, woven from the top
   throughout. 24. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend
   it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the Scripture might
   be fulfilled, which saith, They divided my garments among them, and
   cast lots on my vesture: these things therefore the soldiers did.


   23. Then the soldiers. The other Evangelists also mention the parting
   of Christ's garments among the soldiers, (Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:24;
   Luke 23:34.) There were four soldiers who parted among themselves all
   his garments, except the coat, which, being without seam could not be
   divided, and therefore they cast lots on it. To fix our minds on the
   contemplation of the purpose of God, the Evangelists remind us that, in
   this occurrence also, there was a fulfillment of Scripture. It may be
   thought, however, that the passage, which they quote from Psalm 22:18,
   is inappropriately applied to the subject in hand; for, though David
   complains in it that he was exposed as a prey to his enemies, he makes
   use of the word garments to denote metaphorically all his property; as
   if he had said, in a single word, that "he had been stripped naked and
   bare by wicked men;" and, when the Evangelists disregard the figure,
   they depart from the natural meaning of the passage. But we ought to
   remember, in the first place, that the psalm ought not to be restricted
   to David, as is evident from many parts of it, and especially from a
   clause in which it is written, I will proclaim thy name among the
   Gentiles, (Psalm 22:22) which must be explained as referring to Christ.
   We need not wonder, therefore, if that which was faintly shadowed out
   in David is beheld in Christ with all that superior clearness which the
   truth ought to have, as compared with the figurative representation of
   it.

   Let us also learn that. Christ was stripped of his garments, that he
   might clothe us with righteousness; that his naked body was exposed to
   the insults of men, that we may appear in glory before the
   judgment-seat of God. As to the allegorical meaning to which some men
   have tortured this passage, by making it mean, that heretics tear
   Scripture in pieces, it is too far-fetched; though I would not object
   to such a comparison as this, --that, as the garments of Christ were
   once divided by ungodly soldiers, so, in the present day, there are
   perverse men who, by foreign inventions, tear the whole of the
   Scripture, with which Christ is clothed, in order that he may be
   manifested to us. But the wickedness of the Papists, accompanied by
   shocking blasphemy against God, is intolerable. They tell us, that
   Scripture is torn to pieces by heretics, but that the coat -- that is,
   the Church -- remains entire; and thus they endeavor to prove that,
   without paying any attention to the authority of Scripture, the unity
   of faith consists in the mere title of the Church; as if the unity of
   the Church were itself founded on any thing else than the authority of
   Scripture. When, therefore, they separate faith from Scripture, so that
   it may continue to be attached to the Church alone, by such a divorce
   they not only strip Christ of his garments, but tear in pieces his body
   by shocking sacrilege. And though we should admit what they maintain,
   that the coat without seam is a figure of the Church, they will be very
   far from gaining their point: for it will still remain to be proved,
   that the Church is placed under their authority, of which they show no
   sign whatever.

   John 19:25-27

   25. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's
   sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 26. Jesus, therefore,
   seeing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by her,
   saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 27. Then he saith to the
   disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour, the disciple took her
   to his own home.


   25. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus. The Evangelist here mentions
   incidentally, that while Christ obeyed God the Father, he did not fail
   to perform the duty which he owed, as a son, towards his mother. True,
   he forgot himself, and he forgot every thing, so far as was necessary
   for the discharge of obedience to his Father, but, after having
   performed that duty, he did not neglect what he owed to his mother.
   Hence we learn in what manner we ought to discharge our duty towards
   God and towards men. It often happens that, when God calls us to the
   performance of any thing, our parents, or wife, or children, draw us in
   a contrary direction, so that we cannot give equal satisfaction to all.
   If we place men in the same rank with God, we judge amiss. We must,
   therefore, give the preference to the command, the worship, and the
   service of God; after which, as far as we are able, we must give to men
   what is their due.

   And yet the commands of the first and second table of the Law never jar
   with each other, though at first sight they appear to do so; but we
   must begin with the worship of God, and afterwards assign to men an
   inferior place. Such is the import of the following statements:

   He who loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me,
   (Matthew 10:41;)

   and,

   If any one hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
   brethren, and sisters, he cannot be my disciple,
   (Luke 14:26.)

   We ought, therefore, to devote ourselves to the interests of men, so as
   not in any degree to interfere with the worship and obedience which we
   owe to God. When we have obeyed God, it will then be the proper time to
   think about parents, and wife, and children; as Christ attends to his
   mother, but it is after that he is on the cross, to which he has been
   called by his Father's decree.

   Yet, if we attend to the time and place when these things happened,
   Christ's affection for his mother was worthy of admiration. I say
   nothing about the severe tortures of his body; I say nothing about the
   reproaches which he suffered; but, though horrible blasphemies against
   God filled his mind with inconceivable grief, and though he sustained a
   dreadful contest with eternal death and with the devil, still, none of
   these things prevent him from being anxious about his mother. We may
   also learn from this passage, what is the honor which God, by the Law,
   commands us to render to parents, (Exodus 20:12.) Christ appoints the
   disciple to be his substitute, and charges him to support and take care
   of his mother; and hence it follows, that the honor which is due to
   parents consists, not in cold ceremony, [171] but in the discharge of
   all necessary duties.

   On the other hand, we ought to consider the faith of those holy women
   [172] It is true that, in following Christ to the cross, they displayed
   more than ordinary affection; but, if they had not been supported by
   faith they could never have been present at this exhibition. As to John
   himself, we infer that, though his faith was choked for a short time,
   it was not wholly extinguished. How shameful will it be, if the dread
   of the cross deters us from following Christ, when the glory of his
   resurrection is placed before our eyes, whereas the women beheld in it
   nothing but disgrace and cursing!

   Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. He calls her either the wife or
   the daughter of Cleophas; but I prefer the latter interpretation. [173]
   He says, that she was the sister of the mother of Jesus, and, in saying
   so, he adopts the phraseology of the Hebrew language, which includes
   cousins, and other relatives, [174] under the term brothers. We see
   that it was not in vain that Mary Magdalene was delivered from seven
   devils, (Mark 16:9; Luke 8:2;) since she showed hersclf, to the last,
   to be so faithful a disciple to Christ.

   26. Woman, behold thy son! [175] As if he had said, "Henceforth I shall
   not be an inhabitant of the earth, so as to have it in my power to
   discharge to thee the duties of a son; and, therefore, I put this man
   in my room, that he may perform my office." The same thing is meant,
   when he says to John,

   Behold thy mother! For by these words he charges him to treat her as a
   mother, and to take as much care of her as if she had been his own
   mother.

   In refraining from mentioning his mother's name and in simply calling
   her Woman! some think that he did so, in order not to pierce her heart
   with a deeper wound. I do not object to this view; but there is another
   conjecture which is equally probable, that Christ intended to show
   that, after having completed the course of human life, he lays down the
   condition in which he had lived, and enters into the heavenly kingdom,
   where he will exercise dominion over angels and men; for we know that
   Christ was always accustomed to guard believers against looking at the
   flesh, and it was especially necessary that this should be done at his
   death.

   27. The disciple took her to his own home. It is a token of the
   reverence due by a disciple to his master, that John so readily obeys
   the command of Christ. Hence also it is evident, that the Apostles had
   their families; for John could not have exercised hospitality towards
   the mother of Christ, or have taken her to his own home, if he had not
   had a house and a regular way of living. Those men, therefore, are
   fools, who think that the Apostles relinquished their property, and
   came to Christ naked and empty; but they are worse than fools, who make
   perfection to consist in beggary.

   John 19:28-30

   28. After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished,
   that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. 29. And a
   vessel full of vinegar was placed there; and, filling a sponge with
   vinegar, they fixed it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 30. When,
   therefore, Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished;
   and, bowing his head, he yielded up his breath.


   28. Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished. John
   purposely passes by many things which are related by the other three
   Evangelists. He now describes the last act, which was an event of the
   greatest importance.When John says that a vessel was placed there, he
   speaks of it as a thing that was customary. There has been much
   controversy on this subject; but I agree with those who think (and,
   indeed, the custom is proved by histories) that it was a kind of
   beverage usually administered for the purpose of accelerating the death
   of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone sufficient torture
   [176] Now, it ought to be remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing
   to drink till all things have been accomplished; and thus he testified
   his infinite love towards us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his
   desire to promote our salvation. No words can fully express the
   bitterness of the sorrows which he endured; and yet he does not desire
   to be freed from them, till the justice of God has been satisfied, and
   till he has made a perfect atonement. [177]

   But how does he say, that all things were accomplished, while the most
   important part still remained to be performed, that is, his death?
   Besides, does not his resurrection contribute to the accomplishment of
   our salvation? I answer, John includes those things which were
   immediately to follow. Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen
   again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going
   forward to death and resurrection. In this manner he instructs us, by
   his own example, to render perfect obedience, that we may not think it
   hard to live according to his good pleasure, even though we must
   languish in the midst of the most excruciating pains.

   That the Scripture might be fulfilled. From what is stated by the other
   Evangelists, (Matthew 27:48; Mark 15:23, 36; Luke 23:36,) it may
   readily be concluded that the passage referred to is Psalm 69:21,

   They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
   drink.

   It is, undoubtedly, a metaphorical expression, and David means by it,
   not only that they refused to him the assistance which he needed, but
   that they cruelly aggravated his distresses. But there is no
   inconsistency in saying that what had been dimly shadowed out in David
   was more clearly exhibited in Christ: for thus we are enabled more
   fully to perceive the difference between truth and figures, when those
   things which David suffered, only in a figurative manner, are
   distinctly and perfectly manifested in Christ. To show that he was the
   person whom David represented, Christ chose to drink vinegar; and he
   did so for the purpose of strengthening our faith.

   I thirst. Those who contrive a metaphorical meaning for the word
   thirst, as if he meant that, instead of a pleasant and agreeable
   beverage, they gave him bitterness, as if they intended to flay his
   throat, [178] are more desirous to be thought ingenious than to promote
   true edification; and, indeed, they are expressly refuted by the
   Evangelist, who says that Christ asked for vinegar when he was near
   death; from which it is evident that he did not desire any luxuries.
   [179]

   29. And, having filled a sponge with vinegar, they fixed it on hyssop.
   When he says that they fixed the sponge on hyssop, the meaning is, that
   they fastened it to the end of a bunch of hyssop, that it might be
   raised to Christ's mouth; for, in that country, hyssops grow as large
   as small shrubs, [180]

   30. It is finished. He repeats the same word which he had lately
   employed, [181] Now this word, which Christ employs, well deserves our
   attention; for it shows that the whole accomplishment of our salvation,
   and all the parts of it, are contained in his death. We have already
   stated that his resurrection is not separated from his death, but
   Christ only intends to keep our faith fixed on himself alone, and not
   to allow it to turn aside in any direction whatever. The meaning,
   therefore, is, that every thing which contributes to the salvation of
   men is to be found in Christ, and ought not to be sought anywhere else;
   or -- which amounts to the same thing -- that the perfection of
   salvation is contained in him.

   There is also an implied contrast; for Christ contrasts his death with
   the ancient sacrifices and with all the figures; as if he had said," Of
   all that was practiced under the Law, there was nothing that had any
   power in itself to make atonement for sins, to appease the wrath of
   God, and to obtain justification; but now the true salvation is
   exhibited and manifested to the world." On this doctrine depends the
   abolition of all the ceremonies of the Law; for it would be absurd to
   follow shadows, since we have the body in Christ.

   If we give our assent to this word which Christ pronounced, we ought to
   be satisfied with his death alone for salvation, and we are not at
   liberty to apply for assistance in any other quarter; for he who was
   sent by the Heavenly Father to obtain for us a full acquittal, and to
   accomplish our redemption, knew well what belonged to his office, and
   did not fail in what he knew to be demanded of him. It was chiefly for
   the purpose of giving peace and tranquillity to our consciences that he
   pronounced this word, It is finished. Let us stop here, therefore, if
   we do not choose to be deprived of the salvation which he has procured
   for us. [182]

   But the whole religion of Popery tends to lead men to contrive for
   themselves innumerable methods of seeking salvation; and hence we
   infer, that it is full to overflowing with abominable sacrileges. More
   especially, this word of Christ condemns the abomination of the Mass.
   All the sacrifices of the Law must have ceased, for the salvation of
   men has been completed by the one sacrifice of the death of Christ.
   What right, then, have the Papists, or what plausible excuse can they
   assign for saying, that they are authorised to prepare a new sacrifice,
   to reconcile God to men? They reply that it is not a new sacrifice, but
   the very sacrifice which Christ offered. But this is easily refuted;
   for, in the first place, they have no command to offer it; and,
   secondly, Christ, having once accomplished, by a single oblation, all
   that was necessary to be done, declares, from the cross, that all is
   finished. They are worse than forgers, therefore, for they wickedly
   corrupt and falsify the testament sealed by the precious blood of the
   Son of God.

   He yielded up his breath. All the Evangelists take great care to
   mention the death of Christ, and most properly; for we obtain from it
   our confident hope of life, and we likewise obtain from it a fearless
   triumph over death, because the Son of God has endured it in our room,
   and, in his contest with it, has been victorious. But we must attend to
   the phraseology which John employs, and which teaches us, that all
   believers, who die with Christ, peacefully commit their souls to the
   guardianship of God, who is faithful, and will not suffer to perish
   what he hath undertaken to preserve. The children of God, as well as
   the reprobate, die; but there is this difference between them, that the
   reprobate give up the soul, without knowing where it goes, or what
   becomes of it; [183] while the children of God commit it, as a precious
   trust, to the protection of God, who will faithfully guard it till the
   day of the resurrection. The word breath is manifestly used here to
   denote the immortal soul.

   John 19:31-37

   31. The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain upon the
   cross on the Sabbath-day, (for it was the preparation, and it was the
   great day of that Sabbath,) besought Pilate that their legs might be
   broken, and that they might be taken away. 32. Then the soldiers came,
   and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
   with him. 33. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already
   dead, they broke not his legs; 34. But one of the soldiers pierced his
   side with a spear, and immediately there came out of it blood and
   water. 35. And he who saw it hath borne testimony of it, and his
   testimony is true, and he knoweth that he saith true, that you may
   believe. 36. And these things were done [184] that the Scripture might
   be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 37. And again, another
   Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.


   31. For it was the preparation. This narrative also tends to the
   edification of our faith; first, because it shows that what had been
   foretold in the Scriptures is fulfilled in the person of Christ; and,
   secondly, because it contains a mystery of no ordinary value. The
   Evangelist says, that the Jews besought that the bodies might be taken
   down from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of
   God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their
   whole attention to small matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes
   without any hesitation; for, in order to a strict observance of their
   Sabbath, they are careful to avoid outward pollution; and yet they do
   not consider how shocking a crime it is to take away the life of an
   innocent man. Thus we saw a little before, that

   they did not enter into the governor's hall, that they might not be
   defiled,
   (John 18:28,)

   while the whole country was polluted by their wickedness. Yet, by their
   agency, the Lord carries into effect what was of the greatest
   importance for our salvation, that, by a wonderful arrangement, the
   body of Christ remains uninjured, and blood and water low out of his
   side.

   And it was the great day of that Sabbath [185] Another reading more
   generally approved is, and that Sabbath-day was great; but the reading
   which I have adopted is supported by many manuscripts that are ancient
   and of great authority. Let the reader choose for himself. If we read
   ekeinou in the genitive case, (ekeinou tou sabbatou of that Sabbath)
   the word Sabbath must be understood to denote the week; as if the
   Evangelist had said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on
   account of the Passover. Note, the Evangelist speaks of the following
   day, which began at sunset. But, if we choose rather to read ekeine, in
   the nominative case, en gar megale he hemera ekeine tou sabbatou, and
   That was the great day of the Sabbath, the meaning will be nearly the
   same in substance; only there would be this difference in the words,
   that the Passover, which was to take place on the following day, would
   render that Sabbath more solemn.

   33. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead. That
   they break the legs of the two robbers, and after having done so, find
   that Christ is already dead, and therefore do not touch his body,
   appears to be a very extraordinary work of the providence of God.
   Ungodly men will, no doubt, say that it happens naturally that one man
   dies sooner than another; but, if we examine carefully the whole course
   of the narrative, we shall be constrained to ascribe it to the secret
   purpose of God, that the death of Christ was brought on much more
   rapidly than men could have at all expected, and that this prevented
   his legs from being broken.

   34. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear. When the
   soldier pierced Christ's side with his spear, he did so for the purpose
   of ascertaining if he was dead; but God had a higher object in view, as
   we shall immediately see. It was a childish contrivance of the Papists,
   when, out of the Greek word lonche, which means a spear, [186] they
   manufactured the proper name of a man, and called this soldier
   Longinus, and, to give an air of plausibility to their story, foolishly
   alleged that he had been formerly blind, and that, after having
   received his sight, he was converted to the faith. Thus they have
   placed him in the catalogue of the saints. [187] Since their prayers,
   whenever they call on God, rest on such intercessors, what, I ask, will
   they ever be able to obtain? But they who despise Christ, and seek the
   intercessions of the dead, deserve that the devil should drive them to
   ghosts and phantoms.

   And immediately there came out blood and water. Some men have deceived
   themselves by imagining that this was a miracle; for it is natural that
   the blood, when it is congealed, should lose its red color, and come to
   resemble water. It is well known also that water is contained in the
   membrane which immediately adjoins the intestines. What has led them
   astray is, that the Evangelist takes so much pains to explain that
   blood flowed along with the water, as if he were relating something
   unusual and contrary to the order of nature. But he had quite a
   different intention; namely, to accommodate his narrative to the
   passages of Scripture which he immediately subjoins, and more
   especially that believers might infer from it what he states elsewhere,
   that Christ came with water and blood, (1 John 5:6.) By these words he
   means that Christ brought the true atonement and the true washing; for,
   on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and justification, and, on the
   other hand, the sanctification of the soul, were prefigured in the Law
   by those two symbols, sacrifices and washings. In sacrifices, blood
   atoned for sins, and was the ransom for appeasing the wrath of God.
   Washings were the tokens of true holiness, and the remedies for taking
   away uncleanness and removing the pollutions of the flesh.

   That faith may no longer rest on these elements, John declares that the
   fulfillment of both of these graces is in Christ; and here he presents
   to us a visible token of the same fact. The sacraments which Christ has
   left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and
   sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, (Romans
   6:4,) is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord's Supper is the
   pledge of a perfect atonement. But they differ widely from the ancient
   figures of the Law; for they exhibit Christ as being present, whereas
   the figures of the Law pointed out that he was still at a distance. For
   this reason I do not object to what Augustine says, that our sacraments
   have flowed from Christ's side; for, when Baptism and the Lord's Supper
   lead us to Christ's side, that by faith we may draw from it, as from a
   fbuntain, what they represent, then are we truly washed from our
   pollutions, and renewed to a holy life, and then do we truly live
   before God, redeemed from death, and delivered from condemnation.

   36. A bone of him shall not be broken. This citation is made from
   Exodus 12:46, and Numbers 9:12, where Moses treats of the paschal lamb.
   Note, Moses takes for granted that that lamb was a figure of the true
   and only sacrifice, by which the Church was to be redeemed. Nor is this
   inconsistent with the fact, that it was sacrificed as the memorial of a
   redemption which had been already made; for, while God intended that it
   should celebrate the former favor, he also intended that it should
   exhibit the spiritual deliverance of the Church, which was still
   future. On that account Paul, without any hesitation, applies to Christ
   the rule which Moses lays down about eating the lamb:

   for even Christ, our Passover, is sacred for us. Therefore let us keep
   the feast, not with old leaven, neither with, the leaven of malice and
   wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,
   (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8.)

   From this analogy, or resemblance, faith derives no ordinary advantage,
   for, in all the ceremonies of the Law, it beholds the salvation which
   has been manifested in Christ. Such is also the design of the
   Evangelist John, when he says that Christ was not only the pledge of
   our redemption, but also the price of it, because in him we see
   accomplished what was formerly exhibited to the ancient people under
   the figure of the passover. Thus also the Jews are reminded that they
   ought to seek in Christ the substance of all those things which the Law
   prefigured, but did not actually accomplish.

   37. They shall look on him whom they pierced. This passage is violently
   tortured by those who endeavor to explain it literally as referring to
   Christ. Nor is this the purpose for which the Evangelist quotes ib but
   rather to show that Christ is that God who formerly complained, by
   Zechariah, that the Jews had pierced his heart, (Zechariah 12:10) Now,
   God speaks there after the manner of men, declaring that He is wounded
   by the sins of his people, and especially by their obstinate contempt
   of his word, in the same manner as a mortal man receives a deadly
   wound, when his heart is pierced; as he says, elsewhere, that his
   Spirit was deeply grieved, [188] Now, as Christ is God manifested in
   the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16,) John says that in his visible flesh was
   plainly accomplished what his Divine Majesty had endured from the Jews,
   so far as it was capable of enduring; not that God can be at all
   affected by the outrages of men, or that the reproaches which are cast
   at him from the earth ever reach him, but because by this mode of
   expression he intended to declare with what enormous sacrilege the
   wickedness of men is chargeable, when it rises in rebellion against
   heaven. What was done by the hand of a Roman soldier the ]Evangelist
   John justly imputes to the Jews; as they are elsewhere said to have
   crucified the Son of God, (Acts 2:36,) though they did not lay a finger
   on his body.

   A question now arises as to this passage taken from the prophet, [189]
   Does God promise to the Jews repentance to salvation, or, does he
   threaten that he will come as an avenger? For my own part, when I
   closely examine the passage, I think that it includes both; namely,
   that out of a worthless and unprincipled nation God will gather a
   remnant for salvation, and that, by his dreadful vengeance, he will
   show to despisers who it is with whom they have to do; for we know that
   they were wont to treat the prophets as insolently as if the prophets
   had told nothing but fables, and had received no commission from God.
   God declares that they will not pass unpunished, for he will at length
   maintain his cause.

   of St Mary, at Lyons, is as follows: -- Qui Salvatoris latus Cruce
   Cuspfdefixit, Lo,'Ginus Mc jacet --' Here lies Longinu's, who pierced
   the Savior's side on the Cross with a spear.'" As the learned annotator
   has thus summarily adverted to this legendary tale, it is right that
   the reader should be briefly put in possession of the whole of it, as
   it has been collected by Moreri from Tillemont and other ecclesiastical
   writers, in his "Directory" under the head, St Longin -- (St Longinns.)
   This St Longinus is twofold: "some saying, that he was the soldier that
   pierced our Lord's side with a spear; and some, that he was the
   centurion who commanded the guard at the cross. The legends report both
   these persons to have been converted to the Christian faith, to have
   suffered martyrdom, and to have been canonized." Moreri, however,
   though an ecclesiastic of the Romish Church, was constrained to add,
   The acts of both Longinuses are manifestly false; and the circumstances
   they allege mutually refute each other." It would appear that the name
   Longinus has been formed from the Greek lonche, spear: Longinus being
   the Latin form of lonchimnos, -- spear-man. Thus, St Longinus is found
   to be a similar saint to the Sancta Veronica, reported by Brydone. "The
   Greeks," continues Moreri, celebrate the martyrdom of Longinus, the
   centurion, on the 16th of October, the Latins on the 15th of March, and
   the Copts on the 1st of November. The martyrdom of Longinus, the
   soldier, is not acknowledged by the Greeks; but the Latins commemorate
   it on different days; some on the 15th of March, some on the 1st of
   September, others on the 22nd of November; or 11th of December." We
   thus see how little this offspring of credulity and superstition merits
   the attention of the readers of the Gospel. -- Granville Penn's

     __________________________________________________________________

   John 19:38-42

   38. After these things, Joseph of Arimathen (who was a disciple of
   Jesus, but secretly, through fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he
   might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. He came,
   then, and took the body of Jesus. 39. And Nicodemus, also, (who at
   first came to Jesus by night,) came bearing a mixture of myrrh and
   aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. 40. Then they took the body of
   Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with spices, as the custom of the
   Jews is to bury. 41. And in the place where he was crucified there was
   a garden; and in the garden there was a new sepulcher, in which no
   person had yet been laid. 42. There they laid Jesus, therefore, on
   account of the preparation of the Jews; for the sepulcher was near at
   hand.


   38. Joseph of Arimathea besought Pilate. John now relates by whom, and
   in what place, and with what magnificence, Christ was buried. He
   mentions two persons who buried Christ; namely, Joseph and Nicodemus,
   the former of whom requested Pilate to give him the dead body, which
   otherwise would have been exposed to the lawless violence of the
   soldiers. Matthew (Matthew 27:57) says, that he was a rich man, and
   Luke (Luke 23:50) says, that he was a counsellor; that is, he held the
   rank of a senator. As to Nicodemus, we have seen, in the Third Chapter
   of this Gospel, that he held an honorable rank among his own
   countrymen; and that he was also rich, may be easily inferred from the
   great expense which he laid out in procuring this mixture.

   Till now, therefore, riches had prevented them from professing to be
   the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less influence in
   keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred. The
   Evangelist expressly says, that Joseph has formerly been kept back by
   this fear from venturing to declare openly that he was a disciple of
   Christ; and as to Nicodemus, he repeats what we have already seen, that
   he came to Jesus secretly, and by night, (John 3:2 and John 7:50.)
   Whence, therefore, do they derive such heroic magnanimity that, when
   affairs are at the lowest ebb, they fearlessly come forth to public
   view? I say nothing of the great and evident danger which they must
   have incurred; but the most important point is, that they did not
   scruple to place themselves in a state of perpetual warfare with their
   own nation. It is therefore certain that this was effected by a
   heavenly impulse, so that they who, through, fear, did not render the
   honor due to him while he was alive, now run to his dead body, as if
   they had become new men.

   They bring their spices to embalm the body of Christ; but they would
   never have done so, if they had been perfumed with the sweet sayour of
   his death. This shows the truth of what Christ had said,

   Unless a grain of corn die, it remaineth alone;
   but when it is dead, it bringeth forth much fruit,
   (John 12:24.)

   For here we have a striking proof that his death was more quickening
   than his life; and so great was the efficacy of that sweet sayour which
   the death of Christ conveyed to the minds of those two men, that it
   quickly extinguished all the passions belonging to the flesh. So long
   as ambition and the love of money reigned in thenb the grace of Christ
   had no charms for them; but now they begin to disrelish the whole
   world.

   Besides, let us learn that their example points out to us what we owe
   to Christ. Those two men, as a testimony of their faith, not only took
   down Christ from the cross with great hazard, but boldly carried him to
   the grave. Our slothfulness will be base and shameful if, now that he
   reigns in the heavenly glory, we withhold from him the confession of
   our faith. So much the less excusable is the wickedness of those who,
   though they now deny Christ by base hypocrisy, plead in his behalf the
   example of Nicodemus. In one thing, I admit, they resemble him, that
   they endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to bury Christ; but the
   time for burying is past, since he hath ascended to the right hand of
   the Father, that he may reign gloriously over angels and men, and that
   every tongue may proclaim his dominion, (Philippians 2:9, 10.)

   Secretly, through fear of the Jews. As this fear is contrasted with the
   holy boldness which the Spirit of the Lord wrought in the heart of
   Joseph, there is reason to believe that it was not free from blame. Not
   that all fear, by which believers guard against tyrants and enemies of
   the Church, is faulty, but because the weakness of faith is manifested,
   whenever the confession of faith is withheld through fear. We ought
   always to consider what the Lord commands, and how far he bids us
   advance. He who stops in the middle of the course shows that he does
   not trust in God, and he who sets a higher value on his own life than
   on the command of God is without excuse.

   Who was a disciple of Jesus. When we perceive that the Evangelist
   bestows on Joseph the honorable designation of a disciple, at a time
   when he was excessively timid, and did not venture to profess his faith
   before the world, we learn from it how graciously God acts towards his
   people, and with what fatherly kindness he forgives their offenses. And
   yet the false Nicodemites have no right to flatter themselves, who not
   only keep their faith concealed within their own breast, but, by
   pretending to give their consent to wicked superstitions, do all that
   is in their power to deny that they are disciples of Christ.

   40. As the custom of the Jews is to bury. When Christ had endured
   extreme ignominy on the cross, God determined that his burial should be
   honourable, that it might serve as a preparation for the glory of his
   resurrection. The money expended on it by Nicodemus and Joseph is very
   great, and may be thought by some to be superfluous; but we ought to
   consider the design of God, who even led them, by his Spirit, to render
   this honor to his own Son, that, by the sweet savor of his grave he
   might take away our dread of the cross. But those things which are cut
   of the ordinary course ought not to be regarded as an example.

   Besides, the Evangelist expressly states that he was buried according
   to the custom of the Jews. By these words he informs us that this was
   one of the ceremonies of the Law; for the ancient people, who did not
   receive so clear a statement of the resurrection, and who had not such
   a demonstration and pledge of it as we have in Christ, needed such aids
   to support them, that they might firmly believe and expect the coming
   of the Mediator [190] We ought, therefore, to attend to the distinction
   between us, who have been enlightened by the brightness of the Gospel,
   and the rather, to whom the figures supplied the absence of Christ.
   This is the reason why allowance could then be made for a greater pomp
   of ceremonies, which, at the present day, would not be free from blame;
   for those who now bury the dead at so great an expense do not, strictly
   speaking, bury dead men, but rather, as far as lies in their power,
   draw down from heaven Christ himself, the King of life, and lay him in
   the tomb, for his glorious resurrection [191] abolished those ancient
   ceremonies.

   Among the heathen, too, there was great anxiety and ceremony in burying
   the dead, which unquestionably derived its origin from the ancient
   Fathers of the Jews, [192] in the same manner as sacrifices; but, as no
   hope of the resurrection existed along them, they were not imitators of
   the Fathers, but apes of them; for the promise and word of God is, as
   it were, the soul, which gives life to ceremonies. Take away the word,
   and all the ceremonies which men observe, though outwardly they may
   resemble the worship of godly persons, is nothing else than foolish or
   mad superstition. For our part, as we have said, we ought now to
   maintain sobriety and moderation in this matter, for immoderate expense
   quenches the sweet savour of Christ's resurrection.

   41. Now, in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. This
   is the third point, as I have said, which ought to be observed in the
   history of the burial. It is related by the Evangelist for various
   reasons. In the first place, it did not happen by accident, but by an
   undoubted providence of God, that the body of Christ was buried in a
   new sepulchre; for although he died as all other men die, still, as he
   was to be the first-born from the dead, (Colossians 1:18,) and the
   first-fruits of them that rise, (1 Corinthians 15:20) he had a new
   sepulcher, in which no person had ever been laid True, Nicodemus and
   Joseph had a different object in view; for, in consequence of the short
   time that now remained till sunset, which was the commencement of the
   Sabbath, they looked to the convenience of the place, but, contrary to
   their intention God provided for his own Son a sepulchre which had not
   yet been used. The good men are merely gratified by the place being
   near at hand, that they might not violate the Sabbath; but God offers
   them what they did not seek, that the burial of his Son might have some
   token to distinguish him from the rank of other men. The local
   situation served also to prove the truth of his resurrection, and to
   throw no small light on the narrative which is contained in the
   following chapter.

   John 20:1-9

   1. Now, on;he first day of the week, [193] Mary Magdelene goeth early
   to the sepulcher, while it was, yet dark, and seeth the stone rolled
   away from the sepulchre. 2. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon
   Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them,
   They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not
   where they have laid him. 3. Peter therefore went forth, and the other
   disciple, and came to the sepulcher. 4. And they both ran together, and
   the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 5.
   And, stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying; yet he went not in.
   6. Then Simon Peter came following him, and entered into the sepulcher,
   and saw the linen clothes lying; 7. And the napkin that was about his
   head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place
   by itself. 8. Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher,
   went in also, and he saw and believed. 9. For as yet they knew not the
   scripture, that tie must must rise from the dead.


   1. Now, on the first day of the week. As the resurrection of Christ is
   the most important article of our faith, and without it the hope of
   eternal life is extinguished, for this reason the Evangelists are the
   more careful to prove it, as John here collects many proofs, in order
   to assure us that Christ is risen from the dead. It may be thought
   strange, however, that he does not produce more competent witnesses;
   for he begins with a woman; but thus the saying is fulfilled, that

   God chooseth what is weak, and foolish, and contemptible in the world,
   that he may bring to nought the wisdom, and excellence, and glory, of
   the flesh,
   (1 Corinthians 1:27.)

   There certainly was nothing more of earthly grandeur in the disciples
   than in the women who followed Christ; but as Christ was pleased to
   reckon them the principal witnesses of his resurrection, on this single
   ground their testimony is entitled to the greatest deference, and is
   not liable to any objection. As to the priests, and scribes, and the
   whole people, and even Pilate, nothing but gross and wilful blindness
   prevented them from firmly believing that Christ was risen. All of
   them, therefore, deserved that seeing they should not see; yet Christ
   revealed himself to the little flock.

   Before proceeding farther, however, it is necessary to show how the
   Evangelists agree with each other; for, at first sight, there appears
   to be some contradiction in their words. John mentions but one woman,
   Mary Magdalene; Matthew 28:1 mentions two, Mary Magdalene, and the
   other Mary; Mark 16:1 mentions three, Mary Magdalene, and Mary (the
   mother) of James, and Salome; Luke 24:10, 22 does not fix the number,
   but only relates that women came, who had followed Christ from Galilee.
   But the difficulty is easily solved in this manner. As Matthew inserts
   the names of two women who were best known, and had the highest
   reputation among the disciples, so John satisfies himself with
   mentioning the name of Mary Magdalene alone, but yet does not exclude
   the others; and, indeed, it is evident, from viewing his words in their
   connection, that she was not alone, for, shortly afterwards, Mary
   Magdalene says, in the plural number, WE know not where they have laid
   him. Although, therefore, John says nothing about her companions, yet
   the other Evangelists, who relate that there were many along with her,
   say nothing that is contradicted by John's narrative.

   The discrepancy as to the time may be easily solved. When John says
   that they came before daybreak, we must understand, that they had set
   out on their journey during the darkness of the night; that, before
   they came to the sepulcher, the day had dawned; and that in the
   evening, after sunset, when the Sabbath was ended, they had bought the
   spices; and thus the narrative of the other Evangelists must be
   reconciled.

   It may be thought that there is another appearance of contradiction in
   its being stated by John, that Mary spoke to none but himself and
   Peter, while Luke 24:10, 11 relates, that she came to the eleven
   Apostles, and that her words appeared to them to be idle tales. But
   this is easily explained, for John intentionally passed by the rest of
   the Apostles, because it was only himself and Peter that came to the
   sepulcher. As to Luke mentioning Peter alone, it is for the same reason
   as we have just now assigned in reference to Mary Megdalene and the
   rest of the women. It is also probable, that the other nine disciples
   were restrained by fear, lest they should be too easily observed if
   they went in a body. Nor is this inconsistent with what Luke appears to
   suggest, that they despised Mary's words; for immediately afterwards he
   adds, that Peter ran, (Luke 24:12.) He therefore means simply that,
   when they first heard it, they appeared to be astonished, but that at
   length Peter took courage, and followed her for the purpose of seeing.

   When Luke relates that Christ appeared to Mary before that she had
   informed the disciples that the grave was empty, the order of the
   narrative is inverted. This is evident from the context, for he adds
   what, John tells us, happened before she saw Jesus; nor is there any
   thing strange in this, for the Hebrew writers frequently relate first
   what is later in the order of time.

   On the first day of the week; or, literally, on the first day of the
   Sabbaths. The Evangelists do not relate when or how Christ rose; for it
   was enough for them to explain at what time, and to what persons, his
   resurrection was made known. John therefore says, that Mary came on the
   first day of the Sabbaths. Literally, the words may be rendered, on One
   (mia) day of the Sabbaths; but it is customary with the Hebrews to use
   the word 'hd (ehad) one, instead of first, because in reckoning we
   begin with one. Now as every seventh day was dedicated to rest, they
   called the whole week a Sabbath conferring this honor on the sacredness
   of the day, that the rest of the time was named from it. The women,
   therefore, came to the sepulcher on the day after the Sabbath, having
   on the same day (but after sunset) bought spices; and afterwards went
   out of the city secretly, and during the darkness of the night, as
   people are wont to do when they are afraid. Now, it was the first day
   of the Sabbaths, with respect to the following Sabbath, because it was
   the commencement of the week, of which the Sabbath was the close.

   3. Peter therefore went forth. There being so little faith, or rather
   almost no faith, both in the disciples and in the women, it is
   astonishing that they had so great zeal; and, indeed, it is not
   possible that religious feelings led them to seek Christ. Some seed of
   faith, therefore, remained in their hearts, but quenched for a time, so
   that they were not aware of having what they had. Thus the Spirit of
   God often works in the elect in a secret manner. In short, we must
   believe that there was some concealed root, from which we see fruit
   produced. Though this feeling of piety, which they possessed, was
   confused, and was accompanied by much superstition, still I give to it
   -- though inaccurately -- the name of faith, because it was only by the
   doctrine of the Gospel that it was produced, and it had no tendency but
   towards Christ. From this seed there at length sprang a true and
   sincere faith, which, leaving the sepulcher, ascended to the heavenly
   glory of Christ.

   When Scripture speaks of the feeble beginnings of faith, it says that
   Christ is born in us, and that we, on the other hand, are born in him;
   but the disciples must be placed almost below infancy, for they are
   ignorant of the resurrection of Christ, but yet the Lord nourishes them
   as a mother nourishes the child that is contained in her womb. Formerly
   they resembled children, and had made a little progress, but the death
   of Christ had rendered them so weak, that they must be again begotten
   and formed, as Paul says of the Galatians,

   My little children, of whom I Travail In Birth again until Christ Be
   Formed in you,
   (Galatians 4:19.)

   When we find that Peter, though he made less haste, is the first to
   enter into the sepulcher, let us learn from it that many persons have
   more given to them in the end than appears at the beginning. And,
   indeed, we sometimes see many, who were full of fervour at the
   commencement, give way when they come to the conflict; while others,
   who appeared to be slow and indolent, assume new courage when danger is
   at hand.

   5. And seeth the linen clothes lying. The linen clothes might be
   regarded as the spoils, intended to lead to the belief of Christ's
   resurrection; for it was not probable that his body had been stripped
   naked, in order that it might be removed to another place. This would
   not have been done by a friend, nor even by an enemy.

   7. And the napkin which was about his head. When the Evangelist says,
   that a napkin was wrapped about his head, this refutes the falsehood of
   the Papists, who pretend that the whole body was sewed up in one linen
   garment, which they hold out to the wretched populace, calling it "the
   holy winding-sheet." [194] I say nothing about their gross ignorance of
   the Latin language, which led them to suppose that the word napkin --
   denoting what was used for wiping the sweat from the face, such as a
   handkerchief [195] -- signified a covering for the whole body; nor do I
   say any thing about their impudence in boasting that they have this
   very napkin in five or six different places. But this gross falsehood
   is intolerable, because it openly contradicts the evangelical history.
   To this is added a fabulous miracle, which they have contrived, to this
   effect, that the likeness of Christ's body continued to be visible in
   the linen cloth. I appeal to you, if such a miracle had been wrought,
   would nothing have been said about it by the Evangelist, who is so
   careful to relate events which were not of so great importance? Let us
   be satisfied with this simple view of the matter, that Christ, by
   laying aside the tokens of death, intended to testify that he had
   clothed himself with a blessed and immortal life.

   8. And he saw and believed. It is a poor exposition which some give of
   these words, that John believed what he had heard Mary say, namely,
   that Christ's body had been carried away; for there is no passage in
   which the word believe bears this meaning, especially when it is used
   simply and without any addition. Nor is this inconsistent with the
   fact, that Peter and John return home, while they are still in doubt
   and perplexity; for in some passages John had employed this
   phraseology, when lie intended to describe the increase of faith.
   Besides, Luke 24:12 relates that Peter wondered at seeing the sepulcher
   in such good order; meaning by this, that Peter thought of something
   greater and loftier than what Mary had told him.

   9. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from
   the dead. They had often heard from the mouth of Christ what they now
   saw with their eyes, but this flowed from their hearts. Being now
   warned by the sight of a strange spectacle, they begin to think of
   Christ as having something Divine, though they are still far from
   having a clear and accurate knowledge of him. John, therefore, accuses
   himself, when he acknowledges that the first time that he believed was,
   when he beheld the proofs of Christ's resurrection.

   Besides, he represents more strongly his own guilt and that of his
   brethren, by adding, that they not only had forgotten the words of
   Christ, but that they did not believe the Scriptures; for to this
   ignorance he ascribes the deficiency of their faith. Hence, too, we may
   draw a useful instruction, that we ought, to ascribe it to our
   carelessness, when we are ignorant of what we ought to know about
   Christ, because we have not profited as we ought to have done by the
   Scriptures, which clearly reveal the excellence of Christ.

   Not to go farther for an instance of this, it may be thought that the
   resurrection of Christ is taught in them obscurely, and only under
   figures; but the attentive reader will find abundantly clear
   testimonies. Paul proves (Acts 13:34) that Christ must have risen from
   the dead, because God declares by the prophet Isaiah, (Isaiah 55:3)
   that, under his reign, the mercy promised to David would be sure. An
   unskilful person might imagine that what Paul quotes is not at all to
   the purpose; but they who believe the principles of fkith, and are well
   acquainted with the Scriptures, have no difficulty in perceiving the
   force of this argument; for, in order theft Christ may secure to us for
   ever the grace of God, Christ himself; must live for ever.

   There are many passages of the same kind, which it is not, now
   necessary to collect. Let us therefore rest satisfied with the three
   following. It is written,

   Thou wilt not permit thy Holy One to see corruption,
   (Psalm 16:10.)

   Peter and Paul explain this prediction as referring to Christ, (Acts
   2:27, and Acts 13:35,) and justly; for there is not one of all the sons
   of Adam who is not of himself liable to corruption. Consequently, the
   immortality of Christ is there declared. It is likewise beyond all
   doubt that the following passage refers to Christ,

   The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy
   enemies thy footstool, (Psalm 110:1.)

   Now, death will not be destroyed till the last day. The kingdom is
   titan given to Christ till the end of the world, and this kingdom
   cannot exist without his life. But Isaiah speaks more clearly than all
   the rest when, after having foretold the death of Christ, he
   immediately adds, that it impossible to declare his age, (Isaiah 53:8.)
   In short we ought to believe that the doctrine of Scripture is so full
   and complete in every respect that whatever is defective in our faith
   ought justly to be attributed to ignorance of the Scriptures.

   John 20:10-15

   10. Then the disciples went away again to their own homes. 11. But Mary
   stood without at the sepulcher, weeping; and as she wept, she stooped
   down to the sepulcher, 12. And seeth two angels in white garments
   sitting, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of
   Jesus had lain. 13. And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She
   saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
   where they have laid him. 14. Having said this, she turned back, and
   seeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 15. Jesus saith
   to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She, thinking that he was the
   gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast carried him hence, tell me
   where thou hast laid hint, and I will take him away.


   10. Then the disciples went away again to their own homes. It is
   possible that their minds were still in a state of doubt and
   uncertainty, when they returned home; for, though John says that they
   believed, yet their faith was not strong, but was only some confused
   remembrance of the miracle and resembled a trance, until it was more
   fully confirmed; and indeed, a strong faith could not be produced
   merely by the sight which they had beheld. Besides, Christ did not
   present himself to their view, until they had been more fully awakened
   from their carnal stupidity. They had indeed given a praise worthy
   demonstration of their zeal, in hastening to the sepulcher; yet Christ
   hid himself from them, because they sought him with too great
   superstition.

   11. But Mary stood at the sepulcher without. The Evangelist now begins
   to describe the manner in which Christ appeared both to the women and
   to the disciples, to testify his resurrection. Though he mentions but
   one woman, Mary, yet I think it is probable that the other women were
   also along with her; for it is not reasonable to suppose, as some have
   done, that the women fainted through fear. Those writers wish to avoid
   a contradiction, but I have already shown that no such contradiction
   exists.

   As to the women remaining at the sepulchre, while the disciples return
   to the city, they are not entitled to great accommodation on this
   account; for the disciples carry with them consolation and joy, but the
   women torment themselves by idle and useless weeping. In short, it is
   superstition alone, accompanied by carnal feelings, that keeps them
   near the sepulchre

   12. And seeth two angels. What an amazing forbearance displayed by our
   Lord, in bearing with so many faults in Mary and her companions! For it
   is no small honor which he confers on them by sending his angels, and,
   at length, making himself known to them, which he had not done to the
   apostles. Though the apostles and the women were afflicted with the
   same disease, yet the stupidity of the apostles was less excusable,
   because they had profited so little by the valuable and careful
   instruction which they had received. One purpose, certainly, which
   Christ had in view in selecting the women, to make the first
   manifestation of himself to them, was, to fill the apostles with shame.

   In white garments. Whether Mary knew them to be angels, or thought that
   they were men, is uncertain. We know that white garments were an emblem
   of the heavenly glory; as we find that Christ was clothed in white
   garments, when he was transfigured on the mountain, and showed his
   glorious majesty to his three apostles, [196] (Matthew 17:2.) Luke
   relates that the angel who appeared to Cornelius stood before him In
   Bright Clothing, (Acts 10:30.) Nor do I deny that linen garments were
   commonly used by the inhabitants of Eastern countries; but by the dress
   of the angels God pointed out something remarkable and uncommon, and
   put marks on them, as it were, that they might be distinguished from
   men. Besides, Matthew 28:3 compares the countenance of the angel, who
   conversed with the women, to lightning. And yet it is possible that
   their fear arose solely from their minds being struck with admiration,
   for it appears that they stood astonished.

   Again, whenever we read that the angels appeared in the visible form of
   men and clothed with garments, this was done on account of the
   ignorance of men. For my part, I have no doubt that they sometimes were
   clothed with real bodies; but whether or not those two angels had
   merely the appearance of bodies, would be a useless inquiry, and I
   shall therefore leave it undetermined. To me it is enough that the Lord
   gave them a human shape, that the women might see and hear them, while
   the magnificent and uncommon dress which they wore distinguished them
   from the ordinary rank of men, and pointed out something divine and
   heavenly.

   One at the head, and the other at the feet. One angel only is mentioned
   by Matthew, (Matthew 28:2.) This, however, does not contradict John's
   narrative; for both angels did not address Mary at the same time, but
   only one of them who had a commission to speak. There is no good ground
   for Augustine's allegory, that the position of the angels -- one at the
   head, and the other at the feet -- pointed out that the Gospel would be
   preached from the East to the West. It is more worthy of observation,
   that Christ, by preparatory arrangements of this nature, made a
   commencement of the glory of his kingdom; for, by the honor which the
   angels render to the sepulcher, not only is the ignominy of the cross
   taken away, but the heavenly majesty of Christ shines.

   13. Woman, why weepest thou? From the statements of the Evangelists, it
   may be readily concluded, that the angel held a long conversation; but
   John gives a brief summary of what was spoken, because this was
   sufficient for proving the resurrection of Christ. The conversation
   consists of reproof mingled with comfort. The angel reproves Mary for
   her excessive weeping, but, at the same time, mingles joy, when he says
   that there is no reason to weep, since Christ has risen.

   14. And seeth Jesus standing It may be asked, Whence arose this
   mistake, that Mary does not recognize Jesus, with whom she must have
   been intimately acquainted? Some think that he appeared in a different
   form, but I think that the fault lay rather in the eyes of the women,
   as Luke (Luke 24:16) says of the two disciples, their eyes were
   withheld from knowing him We will not say, therefore, that Christ was
   continually assuming new shapes, like Proteus [197] but that it is in
   the power of God, who gave eyes to men, to lessen their sharpness of
   vision whenever he thinks proper, that seeing they may not see.

   In Mary we have an example of the mistakes into which the human mind
   frequently falls. Though Christ presents himself to our view, yet we
   imagine that he assumes various shapes, so that our senses conceive of
   any thing rather than of the true Christ; for not only are our powers
   of understanding liable to be deceived, but they are also bewitched by
   the world and by Satan, that they may have no perception of the truth.

   15. Lord, if thou hast carried him hence. She calls him Lord, according
   to the custom of her nation; for the same appellation, Lord, (Kurie
   [198] ) is employed by the Hebrews in addressing laborers and other
   persons of low condition. We see that Mary has no view of this matter
   but what is earthly. She desires only to obtain the dead body of
   Christ, that she may keep it hidden in the sepulcher; but she leaves
   out the most important matter, the elevation of her mind to the divine
   power of his resurrection. We need not wonder, therefore, if such
   grovelling views place a veil before her eyes.

   [196] "Quand il se transfigura on la montague, e, monstra sa majeste
   glorieuse a ses trois apostres."

   [197] Proteus, (Proteus,) a king of Egypt, is mentioned by Herodotus,
   who relates that at Memphis, his native place, a magnificent temple was
   erected for him. The historian quotes as his authorities, the Egyptian
   priests with whom he had conversed, and who detailed to him the most
   mentorable transactions of that reign, connected with the carrying of
   Helena into Egypt; and he produces passages from the Iliad and the
   Odyssey, to prove that Homer was well acquainted with the leading
   facts, though he chose to disguise or palliate them, so as to make a
   better figure in his story, (Herodotus, Book 2 112-116.) The key to the
   present allusion, however, must be found in the fabulous accounts of
   Proteus, as a sea deity, whom Ovid describes as Protea Ambiguum, the
   shape-changing Proteus, (Metamorphoses, Book 2. Fable 1. 5:9,) and
   whose alleged habit frequently changing his shape passed into a
   proverb. "he had (says Lempriere) received the gift of prophecy from
   Neptune, and from his knowledge of futurity mankind received the
   greatest services. He was difficult of access, and, when consulted, he
   refused to give answers, by immediately assuming different shapes, and
   eluding the grasp, if not properly secured by fetters." Proverbial
   references to this fable occur frequently in the ancient writers. --

   John 20:16-18

   16. Jesus saith to her, Mary! She turned herself, and said to him,
   Rabboni! which means, Master! 17. Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for
   I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to
   them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your
   God. 18. Mary Magdalene went and told the disciples that she had seen
   the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.


   16. Jesus saith to her, Mary! That Christ allowed Mary, a short time,
   to fall into a mistake, was useful for confirming her faith; but now,
   by a single word, he corrects her mistake. He had formerly addressed
   her, but his discourse seemed to be that of an unknown person; he now
   assumes the character of the Master, and addresses his disciple by
   name, as we have formerly seen that

   the good shepherd calleth to him by name every sheep of his flock,
   (John 10:3.)

   That voice of the shepherd, therefore, enters into Mary's heart, opens
   her eyes, arouses all her senses, and affects her in such a manner,
   that she immediately surrenders herself to Christ.

   Thus in Mary we have a lively image of our calling; for the only way in
   which we are admitted to the true knowledge of Christ is, when he first
   knows us, and then familiarly invites us to himself, not by that
   ordinary voice which sounds indiscriminately in the ears of all, but by
   that voice with which he especially calls the sheep which the Father
   hath given to him. Thus Paul says,

   After that you have known God, or rather, after that you have been
   known by him,
   (Galatians 4:9.)

   And said to him, Rabboni! The efficacy of the address is evident from
   this circumstance, that Mary immediately renders to Christ the honor
   which is due to him; for the word Rabboni is not only respectful, but
   involves a profession of obedience. Mary therefore declares, that she
   is a disciple of Christ, and submits to him as her Master. This is a
   secret and wonderful change effected on the human understanding, when
   God, enlightening her by his Spirit, renders her clear-sighted, who
   formerly was slow of apprehension, and, indeed, altogether blind.
   Besides, the example of Mary ought to serve the purpose of exhortation,
   that all whom Christ invites to himself may reply to him without delay.

   The word Rabboni is Chaldee, though the Chaldeans pronounce it Ribboni;
   but it is customary to make a change on words, when they are
   transferred to a foreign tongue. The meaning is the same as if we were
   to say, My Lord! or, My Master! But in the time of Christ this mode of
   expression had gained currency, of using Rabbi and Rabboni instead of
   Master.

   17. Touch me not. This appears not to agree with the narrative of
   Matthew; for he expressly says, that the women held him By The Feet,
   and worshipped him, (Matthew 28:9.) Now, since he allowed himself to be
   touched by his disciples, what reason was there for forbidding Mary to
   touch him? The answer is easy, provided that we remember that the women
   were not repelled from touching Christ, till their eagerness to touch
   him had been carried to excess; for, so far as it was necessary for
   removing doubt, he unquestionably did not forbid them to touch him,
   but, perceiving that their attention was too much occupied with
   embracing his feet, he restrained and corrected that immoderate zeal.
   They fixed their attention on his bodily presence, and did not
   understand any other way of enjoying his society than by conversing
   with him on the earth. We ought, therefore, to conclude, that they were
   not forbidden to touch him, until Christ saw that, by their foolish and
   unreasonable desire, they wished to keep him in the world.

   For I am not yet ascended to my Father. We ought to attend to this
   reason which he adds; for by these words he enjoins the women to
   restrain their feelings, until he be received into the heavenly glory.
   In short, he pointed out the design of his resurrection; not such as
   they had imagined it to be, that, after having returned to life, he
   should triumph in the world, but rather that, by his ascension to
   heaven, he should enter into the possession of the kingdom which had
   been promised to him, and, seated at the right hand of the Father,
   should govern the Church by the power of his Spirit. The meaning of the
   words therefore is, that his state of resurrection would not be full
   and complete, until he should sit down in heaven at the right hand of
   the Father; and, therefore, that the women did wrong in satisfying
   themselves with having nothing more than the half of his resurrection,
   and desiring to enjoy his presence in the world. This doctrine yields
   two advantages. The first is, that those who are desirous to succeed in
   seeking Christ must raise their minds upwards; and the second is, that
   all who endeavor to go to him must rid themselves of the earthly
   affections of the flesh, as Paul exhorts,

   If ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God,
   (Colossians 3:1.)

   But go to my brethren. Some limit the word brethren to the cousins and
   relatives [199] of Christ, but, in my opinion, improperly; for why
   should he have sent to them rather than to the disciples? They reply,
   Because John elsewhere testifies, that His Brethren did not believe in
   him. (John 7:5.)

   But I do not think it probable that Christ conferred so great an honor
   on those who are there mentioned. It must also be admitted, that Mary
   Magdalene [200] fully obeyed the injunctions of Christ. Now, it
   immediately follows, that she went to the disciples; from which we
   conclude, that Christ had spoken of them. [201]

   Besides, Christ knew that the disciples, whom those men, by their
   opinion, treat as separated, were assembled in one place; and it would
   have been exceedingly absurd that he should pay attention to I know not
   what sort of persons, and disregard the disciples, who, having been
   collected into one place, were subjected to a violent conflict between
   hope and fear. To this it may be added, that Christ appears to have
   borrowed this expression from Psalm 22:22, where we and these words: I
   will declare thy name to my brethren; for it is beyond all controversy,
   that this passage contains the fulfillment of that prediction.

   I conclude, therefore, that Mary was sent to the disciples in general;
   and I consider that this was done by way of reproach, because they had
   been so tardy and sluggish to believe. And, indeed, they deserve not
   only to have women for their teachers, but even oxen and asses; since
   the Son of God had been so long and laboriously employed in teaching,
   and yet they had made so little, or hardly any progress. Yet this is a
   mild and gentle chastisement, when Christ thus sends his disciples to
   the school of the women, that by their agency, he may bring them back
   to himself. Here we behold also the inconceivable kindness of Christ,
   in choosing and appointing women to be the witnesses of his
   resurrection to the Apostles; for the commission which is given to them
   is the only foundation of our salvation, and contains the chief point
   of heavenly wisdom.

   It ought likewise to be observed, however, that this occurrence was
   extraordinary, and -- we might almost say -- accidental. They are
   commanded to make known to the Apostles what they afterwards, in the
   exercise of the office committed to them, proclaimed to the whole
   world. But, in executing this injunction, they do not act as if they
   had been Apostles; and, therefore, it is wrong to frame a law out of
   this injunction of Christ, and to allow women to perform the office of
   baptizing. Let us be satisfied with knowing that Christ displayed in
   them the boundless treasures of his grace, when he once appointed them
   to be the teachers of the Apostles, and yet did not intend that what
   was done by a singular privilege should be viewed as an example. This
   is peculiarly apparent in Mary Magdalene, who had formerly been
   possessed by seven devils, (Mark 16:9; Luke 8:2;) for it amounted to
   this, that Christ had brought her out of the lowest hell, that he might
   raise her above heaven.

   If it be objected, that there was no reason why Christ should prefer
   the women to the Apostles, since they were not less carnal and stupid,
   I reply, it does not belong to us, but to the Judge, to estimate the
   difference between the Apostles and the women. But I go farther, and
   say, that the Apostles deserved to be more severely censured, because
   they not only had been better instructed than all others, but, after
   having been appointed to be the teachers of the whole world, and after
   having been called the light of the world, (Matthew 5:14,) and the salt
   of the earth, (Matthew 5:13,) they so basely apostatized. Yet it
   pleased the Lord, by means of those weak and contemptible vessels, to
   give a display of his power.

   I ascend to my Father. By using the word ascend he confirms the
   doctrine which I have lately explained; that he rose from the dead, not
   for the purpose of remaining any longer on the earth, but that he might
   enter into the heavenly life, and might thus draw believers to heaven
   along with him. In short, by this term he forbids the Apostles to fix
   their whole attention on his resurrection viewed simply in itself, but
   exhorts them to proceed farther, until they come to the spiritual
   kingdom, to the heavenly glory, to God himself. There is great
   emphasis, therefore, in this word ascend; for Christ stretches out his
   hand to his disciples that they may not seek their happiness anywhere
   else than in heaven;

   for where our treasure is, there also must our heart be,
   (Matthew 6:21.)

   Now, Christ declares, that he ascends on high; and, therefore, we must
   ascend, if we do not wish to be separated from him.

   When he adds, that he ascends To God, he quickly dispels the grief and
   anxiety which the Apostles might feel on account of his departure; for
   his meaning is, that he will always be present with his disciples by
   Divine power. True, the word ascend denotes the distance of places; but
   though Christ be absent in body, yet, as he is with God, his power,
   which is everywhere felt, plainly shows his spiritual presence; for why
   did he ascend to God, but in order that, being seated at God's right
   hand, [202] he might reign both in heaven and in earth? In short, by
   this expression he intended to impress on the minds of his disciples
   the Divine power of his kingdom, that they might not be grieved on
   account of his bodily absence.

   To my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God. The benefit
   and efficacy of that brotherly union, which has been lately mentioned,
   is expressed, when Christ declares that we have this in common with
   himself, that he who is his God and his Father is also our God and our
   Father. I ascend, says he, to my Father, who is also your Father. In
   other passages we learn that we are made partakers of all the blessings
   of Christ; but this is the foundation of the privilege, that he imparts
   to us the very fountain of blessings. It is, unquestionably, an
   invaluable blessing, that believers can safely and firmly believe, that
   He who is the God of Christ is their God, and that He who is the Father
   of Christ is their Father. Nor have we any reason to fear that this
   confidence will be charged with rashness, since it is founded on
   Christ, or that it will be proud boasting, since Christ himself has
   dictated it to us with his own mouth.

   Christ calls Him his God, in so far as, by

   taking upon him the form of a servant, he humbled himself,
   (Philippians 2:7.)

   This is, therefore, peculiar to his human nature, but is applied to his
   whole person, on account of the unity, because he is both God and Man.
   As to the second clause, in which he says that he ascends to his Father
   and our Father, [203] there is also a diversity between him and us; for
   he is the Son of God by nature, while we are the sons of God only by
   adoption; but the grace which we obtain through him is so firmly
   established, that it cannot be shaken by any efforts of the devil, so
   as to hinder us from always calling him our Father, who hath adopted us
   through his Only-begotten Son.

   John 20:19-23

   19. When, therefore, it was evening on that day, which was the first
   day of the Sabbath [204] and while the doors were shut, where the
   disciples were assembled through fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and
   stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be to you. 20. And when he
   had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the
   disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21. Then said Jesus to them
   again, Peace be to you; as the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
   22. When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,
   Receive the Holy Spirit. 23. To those whose sins you remit they shall
   be remitted; and to those whose sins you retain they shall be retained.


   19. When, therefore, it was evening. The Evangelist now relates that
   the resurrection of Christ was proved to the disciples by his presence.
   It did not happen without the providence of God, that all were
   assembled in one place, that the event might be more certain and more
   manifest. It is worthy of notice how gently Christ acted towards them,
   in not keeping them in suspense any longer than till the evening.
   Besides, he enlightened them, bringing the pledge of a new life, while
   darkness was overspreading the world.

   Where the disciples were assembled. As to their having assembled, it
   was an indication of faith, or, at least, of religious feelings. As to
   the circumstance of their keeping themselves concealed by shut doors,
   we perceive in it some proof of their weakness; for, though the
   strongest and boldest minds are sometimes seized with fear, yet it may
   easily be inferred that the apostles, at that time, trembled in such a
   manner as to manifest the deficiency of their faith. This example is
   worthy of notice; for, though they are less courageous than they ought
   to have been, still they do not give way to their weakness. True, they
   seek concealment for the sake of avoiding danger, but they gather
   courage so far as to remain together; otherwise they would have been
   scattered hither and thither, and no man would have ventured to look at
   his neighbor. In this manner we ought to struggle against the weakness
   of our flesh, and not to indulge fear, which tempts us to apostacy.
   Christ also blesses their zeal, when he appears to them while they are
   assembled; and Thomas is justly deprived of the favor bestowed on all
   his brethren, because, like a wandering soldier, he had withdrawn from
   the standard of union. Here, then, is a lesson for those who are
   excessively timid, to sharpen and encourage themselves to correct their
   carnal fear; and particularly they ought to beware lest fear should
   cause them to scatter.

   And while the doors were shut. This circumstance was expressly added,
   because it contains a manifest proof of the Divine power of Christ; but
   this is utterly at variance with the meaning of the Evangelist. We
   ought, therefore, to believe that Christ did not enter without a
   miracle, in order to give a demonstration of his Divinity, by which he
   might stimulate the attention of his disciples; and yet I am far from
   admitting the truth of what the Papists assert, that the body of Christ
   passed through the shut doors. Their reason for maintaining this is,
   for the purpose of proving not only that the glorious body of Christ
   resembled a spirit, but that it was infinite, and could not be confined
   to any one place. But the words convey no such meaning; for the
   Evangelist does not say that he entered through the shut doors, but
   that he suddenly stood in the midst of his disciples, though the doors
   had been shut, and had not been opened to him by the hand of man. We
   know that Peter (Acts 10:10) went out of a prison which was locked; and
   must we, therefore, say that he passed through the midst of the iron
   and of the planks? Away, then, with that childish trifling, which
   contains nothing solid, and brings along with it many absurdities! Let
   us be satisfied with knowing that Christ intended, by a remarkable
   miracle, to confirm his disciples in their belief of his resurrection.

   Peace be to you! This is the ordinary form of salutation among the
   Hebrews; and by the word peace they denote all that cheerfulness and
   prosperity which is usually desired for a happy life. The phrase,
   therefore, means, "May you be well and prosperous!" I mention this,
   because there are some who, in explaining these words, enter into
   unnecessary discussions about peace and harmony, though Christ intended
   nothing else than to desire that his disciples might be happy and
   prosperous.

   20. He showed them his hands and his side. It was necessary to add this
   confirmation, that by all these methods they might be fully assured
   that Christ was risen. If any person think it strange and inconsistent
   with the glory of Christ, that he should bear the marks of his wounds
   even after his resurrection, let him consider, first, that Christ rose
   not so much for himself as for us; and, secondly, that whatever
   contributes to our salvation is glorious to Christ; for, when he
   humbled himself for a time, this took nothing away from his majesty,
   and now, since those wounds, of which we are speaking, serve to confirm
   the belief of his resurrection, they do not diminish his glory. But if
   any person should infer from this, that Christ has still the wounded
   side and the pierced hands, that would be absurd; for it is certain
   that the use of the wounds was temporary, until the Apostles were fully
   convinced that he was risen from the dead.

   Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. This means, that
   all the grief which had been occasional to them by the death of Christ
   was dispelled by his new life.

   21. Jesus saith to them again, Peace be to you. This second salutation
   appears to me to have no other object than that the Lord should receive
   such a degree of attention as was due to the greatness and importance
   of the subjects on which he was about to speak.

   As the Father hath sent me. By these words, Christ, as it were, instals
   them in the office to which he had previously appointed them. True,
   they had been already sent throughout Judea, but only as heralds, to
   issue a command that the supreme Teacher should be heard, and not as
   Apostles, to execute a perpetual office of teaching. But now the Lord
   ordains them to be his ambassadors, to establish his kingdom in the
   world. Let it therefore be held by us as an ascertained truth, that the
   Apostles were now, for the first time, appointed to be ordinary
   ministers of the Gospel.

   His words amount to a declaration, that hitherto he has discharged the
   office of a Teacher, and that, having finished his course, he now
   confers on them the same office; for he means that the Father appointed
   him to be a Teacher on this condition, that he should be employed, for
   a time, in pointing out the way to others, and should, afterwards, put
   those persons in his room to supply his absence, for this reason Paul
   says that he gave some, apostles; some, evangelists; some, pastors, to
   govern the Church till the end of the world, (Ephesians 4:11.) Christ
   therefore testifies, first, that, though he held a temporary office of
   teaching, still the preaching of the Gospel is not for a short time,
   but will be perpetual. Again, that his doctrine may not have less
   authority in the mouth of the Apostles, he bids them succeed to that
   office which he has received from his Father, places them in his room,
   and bestows on them the same authority; and it was proper that their
   ministry should be ratified in this manner, for they were unknown
   persons and of mean condition. Moreover, though they had the highest
   splendor and dignity, yet we know that all that belongs to men does not
   approach to the excellence of faith.

   It is not without reason, therefore, that Christ communicates to his
   Apostles the authority which he received from the Father, that thus he
   may declare that the preaching of the Gospel was committed to him, nut
   by human authority, but by the command of God. But he does not
   substitute them in his room, in such a manner as to resign to them the
   highest authority as a teacher, which the Father intended to be vested
   in him alone. He therefore continues, and will eternally continue to
   be, the only Teacher of the Church; but there is only this difference,
   that he spoke with his mouth so long as he dwelt on earth, but now
   speaks by the Apostles. The succession or substitution, [205]
   therefore, is of such a nature that it takes nothing from Christ, but
   his authority remains full and entire, and his honor unimpaired; for
   that decree by which we are enjoined to hear him, and not others,
   cannot be set aside:

   This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him,
   (Matthew 17:5.)

   In short, Christ intended here to adorn the doctrine of the Gospel and
   not men.

   It ought likewise to be observed, that the only subject which is
   handled in this passage is the preaching of the Gospel; for Christ does
   not send his Apostles to atone for sins, and to procure justification,
   as he was sent by the Father. Accordingly, he makes no allusion in this
   passage to anything which is peculiar to himself, but only appoints
   ministers and pastors to govern the Church; and on this condition, that
   he alone keeps possession of the whole power, while they claim nothing
   for themselves but the ministry.

   22. He breathed on them. Not one of the sons of men is qualified for
   discharging so difficult an office, and, therefore, Christ prepares the
   Apostles for it by the grace of his Spirit. And, indeed, to govern the
   Church of God, to carry the embassy of eternal salvation, to erect the
   kingdom of God on earth, and to raise men to heaven, is a task far
   beyond human capacity. We need not be astonished, therefore, that no
   man is found qualified unless he be inspired by the Holy Spirit; for no
   man can speak a word concerning Christ unless the Spirit guide his
   tongue, (1 Corinthians 12:3;) so far is it from being true that there
   is any man who is competent to discharge faithfully and honestly all
   the duties of so excellent an office. Again, it is the glory of Christ
   alone to form those whom he appoints to be teachers of his Church; for
   the reason why the fullness of the Spirit has been poured out upon him
   is, that he may bestow it upon each person according to a certain
   measure.

   Receive ye the Holy Spirit. Though he continues to be the only Shepherd
   of his Church, he must necessarily display the power of his Spirit in
   the ministers whose agency he employs; and this also he testified by
   the outward symbol, when he breathed on the Apostles; for this would
   not be applicable, if the Spirit did not proceed from him. So much the
   more detestable is the sacrilege of the Papists, who seize and claim
   for themselves the honor which belongs to the Son of God, for their
   mitred bishops, when they make priests, have the effrontery to boast of
   breathing the Holy Spirit on them. But the fact plainly shows how
   different their stinking breath is from the Divine breathing of Christ;
   for what else is it that they do than to change horses into asses?
   Besides, not only does Christ communicate to his disciples the Spirit
   which he has received, but he bestows it as his own, as the Spirit
   which he has in common with the Father. Consequently, all those who
   boast of giving the Spirit by breathing lay claim to the glory of
   Divinity.

   It ought to be observed, that those whom Christ calls to the pastoral
   office he likewise adorns with the necessary gifts, that they may be
   qualified for discharging the office, or, at least, may not come to it
   empty and unprovided. And if this be true, there is no difficulty in
   refuting the foolish boasting of the Papists, who, while they employ
   lofty terms of commendation in extolling their hierarchy, cannot show a
   single spark of the Holy Spirit in their bishops. They wish us to
   believe that they are the lawful pastors of the Church, and, in like
   manner, that they are the apostles and vicars of Christ, while it is
   evident that they are utterly destitute of the grace of the Holy
   Spirit. A sure criterion is here laid down for judging of the calling
   of those who govern the Church of God; and that criterion is, if we see
   that they have received the Holy Spirit

   What Christ chiefly, however, intended by it was, to uphold the dignity
   of the rank of the Apostles; for it was reasonable that those, who had
   been chosen to be the earliest and most distinguished preachers of the
   Gospel, should possess uncommon authority. But if Christ, at that time,
   bestowed the Spirit on the Apostles by breathing, it may be thought
   that it was superfluous to send the Holy Spirit afterwards. I reply,
   the Spirit was given to the Apostles on this occasion in such a manner,
   that they were only sprinkled by his grace, but were not filled with
   full power; for, when the Spirit appeared on them in tongues of fire,
   (Acts 2:3,) they were entirely renewed. And, indeed, he did not appoint
   them to be heralds of his Gospel, so as to send them forth immediately
   to the work, but ordered them to take repose, as we read elsewhere,

   Remain ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye are endued with power from
   on high,
   (Luke 24:49.)

   And if we take all things properly into consideration, we shall
   conclude, not that he furnishes them with necessary gifts for present
   use, but that he appoints them to be the organs of his Spirit for the
   future; and, therefore, this breathing ought to be understood as
   referring chiefly to that magnificent act of sending the Spirit which
   he had so often promised.

   Although Christ might have bestowed grace on his Apostles by a secret
   inspiration, he chose to add a visible breathing in order to confirm
   them more fully. Christ took this outward emblem from the ordinary
   manner of speaking in the Scriptures, which very frequently compare the
   Spirit to wind; a comparison which we briefly accounted for in the
   exposition of the Third Chapter of this Gospel [206] But let the reader
   observe, that with the visible and outward sign the word is also
   joined; for this is the source from which the sacraments derive their
   efficacy; not that the efficacy of the Holy Spirit is contained in the
   word which sounds in our ears, but because the effect of all those
   things which believers receive from the sacraments depends on the
   testimony of the word. Christ breathes on the Apostles: they receive
   not only the breathing, but also the Spirit. And why, but because
   Christ promises to them?

   In like manner, in baptism we put on Christ, (Galatians 3:27,) we are
   washed by his blood, (Revelation 1:5,) our old man is crucified,
   (Romans 6:6,) in order that the righteousness of God may reign in us.
   In the Holy Supper we are spiritually fed with the flesh and blood of
   Christ. Whence do they derive so great efficacy but from the promise of
   Christ, who does and accomplishes by his Holy Spirit what he declares
   by his word? Let us therefore learn, that all the sacraments which men
   have contrived are nothing else than absolute mockeries or frivolous
   amusements, because the signs can have no truth unless they be
   accompanied by the word of the Lord. Now, since we never sport in this
   manner with sacred things, without wickedly pouring contempt on God and
   ruining souls, we ought to be most carefully on our guard against those
   stratagems of Satan.

   If it be objected, that we ought not to blame the Popish bishops, when
   by breathing they consecrate their priests, because in those cases the
   word of Christ accompanies the sign, the answer is obvious. In the
   first place, Christ did not speak to the Apostles so as to appoint a
   perpetual sacrament in the Church, but intended to declare once what we
   said a little ago, that the Spirit proceeds from no other than from
   himself alone. Secondly, he never appoints men to an office without at
   the same time communicating strength to his ministers, and furnishing
   them with ability. I do not mention that in Popery the priests are
   ordained for a totally different, or rather a contrary purpose; namely,
   to murder Christ daily, while the disciples were made Apostles in order
   to slay men by the sword of the Gospel. Yet we ought also to believe
   that it is Christ alone who gives all the blessings which he represents
   and promises by outward signs; for he does not bid the Apostles receive
   the Holy Spirit from the outward breathing, but from himself.

   23. To all whose sins you shall remit. Here, unquestionably, our Lord
   has embraced, in a few words, the sum of the Gospel; for we must not
   separate this power of forgiving sins from the office of teaching, with
   which it is closely connected in this passage. Christ had said a little
   before, As the living Father hath sent me, so I also send you [207] He
   now makes a declaration of what is intended and what is meant by this
   embassy, only he interwove with that declaration what was necessary,
   that he gave to them his Holy Spirit, in order that they might have
   nothing from themselves.

   The principal design of preaching the Gospel is, that men may be
   reconciled to God, and this is accomplished by the unconditional pardon
   of sins; as Paul also informs us, when he calls the Gospel, on this
   account, the ministry of reconciliation, (2 Corinthians 5:18.) Many
   other things, undoubtedly, are contained in the Gospel, but the
   principal object which God intends to accomplish by it is, to receive
   men into favor by not imputing their sins. If, therefore, we wish to
   show that we are faithful ministers of the Gospel, we must give our
   most earnest attention to this subject; for the chief point of
   difference between the Gospel and heathen philosophy lies in this, that
   the Gospel makes the salvation of men to consist in the forgiveness of
   sins through free grace. This is the source of the other blessings
   which God bestows, such as, that God enlightens and regenerates us by
   his Spirit, that he forms us anew to his image, that he arms us with
   unshaken firmness against the world and Satan. Thus the whole doctrine
   of godliness, and the spiritual building of the Church, rests on this
   foundation, that God, having acquitted us from all sins, adopts us to
   be his children by free grace.

   While Christ enjoins the Apostles to forgive sins, he does not convey
   to them what is peculiar to himself. It belongs to him to forgive sins.
   This honor, so far as it belongs peculiarly to himself, he does not
   surrender to the Apostles, but enjoins them, in his name, to proclaim
   the forgiveness of sins, that through their agency he may reconcile men
   to God. In short, properly speaking, it is he alone who forgives sins
   through his apostles and ministers. [208]

   But it may be asked, Since he appoints them to be only the witnesses or
   heralds of this blessing, and not the authors of it, why does he extol
   their power in such lofty terms? I reply, he did so in order to confirm
   their faith. Nothing is of more importance to us, than to be able to
   believe firmly, that our sins do not come into remembrance before God.
   Zacharias, in his song, calls it the knowledge of salvation, (Luke
   1:77;) and, since God employs the testimony of men to prove it,
   consciences will never yield to it, unless they perceive God himself
   speaking in their person. Paul accordingly says,

   We exhort you to be reconciled to God, as if Christ besought you by us,
   (2 Corinthians 5:20.)

   We now see the reason why Christ employs such magnificent terms, to
   commend and adorn that ministry which he bestows and enjoins on the
   Apostles. It is, that believers may be fully convinced, that what they
   hear concerning the forgiveness of sins is ratified, and may not less
   highly value the reconciliation which is offered by the voice of men,
   than if God himself stretched out his hand from heaven. And the Church
   daily receives the most abundant benefit from this doctrine, when it
   perceives that her pastors are divinely ordained to be sureties for
   eternal salvation, and that it must not go to a distance to seek the
   forgiveness of sins, which is committed to their trust.

   Nor ought we to esteem less highly this invaluable treasure, because it
   is exhibited in earthen vessels; but we have ground of thanksgiving to
   God, who hath conferred on men so high an honor, as to make them the
   ambassadors and deputies of God, and of his Son, in declaring the
   forgiveness of sins. There are fanatics who despise this embassy; but
   let us know, that, by doing so, they trample under foot the blood of
   Christ.

   Most absurdly do the Papists, on the other hand, torture this passage,
   to support their magical absolutions. If any person do not confess his
   sins in the ear of the priest, he has no right, in their opinion, to
   expect forgiveness; for Christ intended that sins should be forgiven
   through the Apostles, and they cannot absolve without having examined
   the matter; therefore, confession is necessary. Such is their beautiful
   argument. [209] But they fall into a strange blunder, when they pass by
   the most important point of the matter; namely, that this right was
   granted to the Apostles, in order to maintain the credit of the Gospel,
   which they had been commissioned to preach. For Christ does not here
   appoint confessors, to inquire minutely into each sin by means of low
   mutterings, but preachers of his Gospel, who shall cause their voice to
   be heard, and who shall seal on the hearts of believers the grace of
   the atonement obtained through Christ. We ought, therefore, to keep by
   the manner of forgiving sins, so as to know what is that power which
   has been granted to the apostles.

   And to those whose sins you retain. Christ adds this second clause, in
   order to terrify the despisers of his Gospel, that they may know that
   they will not escape punishment for this pride. As the embassy of
   salvation and of eternal life has been committed to the apostles, so,
   on the other hand, they have been armed with vengeance against all the
   ungodly, who reject the salvation offered to them, as Paul teaches, (2
   Corinthians 10:6.) But this is placed last in order, because it was
   proper that the true and real design of preaching the Gospel should be
   first exhibited. That we are reconciled to God belongs to the nature of
   the Gospel; that believers are ad-judged to eternal life may be said to
   be accidentally connected with it. [210] For this reason, Paul, in the
   passage which I lately quoted, when he threatens vengeance against
   unbelievers, immediately adds,

   after that your obedience shall have been fulfilled,
   (2 Corinthians 10:6;)

   for he means, that it belongs peculiarly to the Gospel to invite all to
   salvation, but that it is accidental to it that it brings destruction
   to any.

   It ought to be observed, however, that every one who hears the voice of
   the Gospel, if he do not embrace the forgiveness of sins which is there
   promised to him, is liable to eternal damnation; for, as it is a living
   savior to the children of God, so to those who perish it is the savour
   of death to death, (2 Corinthians 2:16.) Not that the preaching of the
   Gospel is necessary for condemning the reprobate, for by nature we are
   all lost, and, in addition to the hereditary curse, every one draws
   down on himself additional causes of death, but because the obstinacy
   of those who knowingly and willingly despise the Son of God deserves
   much severer punishment.

   John 20:24-25

   24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, [211] was
   not with them when Jesus came. 25. The other disciples, therefore, said
   to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in
   his hands the print [212] of the nails, and put my finger into the
   print of the nails, [213] and put my hand into his side, I will not
   believe. 26. And after eight days, his disciples were again within, and
   Thomas with them. Then Jesus came, while the doors were shut, and stood
   in the midst, and said, Peace be to you. 27. Then he saith to Thomas,
   Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach thy hand, and
   put it into mv side; and be not faithless, but believing. 28. Thomas
   answered, and said to him, My Lord and my God! 29. Jesus saith to him,
   Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; blessed are they
   who have not seen, and have believed.


   24. But Thomas, one of the twelve. The unbelief of Thomas is here
   related, that by means of it the faith of the godly may be more fully
   confirmed. He was not only slow and reluctant to believe, but even
   obstinate. His dulness of apprehension was the reason why Christ again
   permitted them both to see and to feel him, in the same manner as
   before. In this manner, a new addition to the proof of Christ's
   resurrection was given, not only to Thomas, but, also to us. Besides,
   the obstinacy of Thomas is an example to show, that this wickedness is
   almost natural to all men, to retard themselves of their own accord,
   when the entrance to faith is opened to them.

   25. Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails. This points out
   the source of the vice to be, that every one wishes to be wise from his
   own understanding, and flatters himself beyond measure. If I do not
   see, says he, "and if I do not touch, I will not believe." [214] These
   words have no approach to faith, but it is what may be called a sensual
   judgment, by which I mean, a judgment which is founded on the
   perception of the senses, [215] The same thing happens to all who are
   so devoted to themselves [216] that they leave no room for the word of
   God. It is of no consequence, whether you read the place, or the shape,
   or The Print of the nails; for transcribers may have exchanged tupon
   (print) for topon, (place,) or topon (place) for tupon, (print;) but
   the meaning is not altered on that account. Let the reader, therefore,
   choose which of them he shall prefer. [217]

   26. Reach hither thy finger. We have already spoken once about Christ's
   entrance, and the form of salutation which he employed. When Christ so
   readily yields to the improper request of Thomas, [218] and, of his own
   accord, invites him to feel his hands, and touch the wound of his side,
   we learn from this how earnestly desirous he was to promote our faith
   and that of Thomas; for it was not to Thomas only, but to us also, that
   he looked, that nothing might be wanting which was necessary for
   confirming our faith.

   The stupidity of Thomas was astonishing and monstrous; for he was not
   satisfied with merely beholding Christ but wished to have his hands
   also as witnesses of Christ's resurrection. Thus he was not only
   obstinate, but also proud and contemptuous in his treatment of Christ.
   Now, at least, when he saw Christ, he ought to have been overwhelmed
   with shame and amazement; but, on the contrary, he boldly and
   fearlessly stretches forth his hand, as if he were not conscious of any
   guilt; for it may be readily inferred from the words of the Evangelist,
   that he did not repent before that he had convinced himself by
   touching. Thus it happens that, when we render to the word of God less
   honor than is due to it, there steals upon us, without our knowledge, a
   glowing obstinacy, which brings along with it a contempt of the word of
   God, and makes us lose all reverence for it. So much the more earnestly
   should we labor to restrain the wantonness of our mind, that none of
   us, by improperly indulging in contradiction, and extinguishing, as it
   were, the feeling of piety, may block up against ourselves the gate of
   faith.

   My Lord and my God! Thomas awakes at length, though late, and as
   persons who have been mentally deranged commonly do when they come to
   themselves, exclaims, in astonishment, My Lord and my God! For the
   abruptness of the language has great vehemence; nor can it be doubted
   that shame compelled him to break out into this expression, in order to
   condemn his own stupidity. Besides, so sudden an exclamation shows that
   faith was not wholly extinguished in him, though it had been choked;
   for in the side or hands of Christ he does not handle Christ's
   Divinity, but from those signs he infers much more than they exhibited.
   Whence comes this, but because, after forgetfulness and deep sleep, he
   suddenly comes to himself? This shows, therefore, the truth of what I
   said a little ago, that the faith which appeared to be destroyed was,
   as it were, concealed and buried in his heart.

   The same thing happens sometimes with many persons; for they grow
   wanton for a time, as if they had cast off all fear of God, so that
   there appears to be no longer any faith in them; but as soon as God has
   chastised them with a rod, the rebellion of their flesh is subdued, and
   they return to their right senses. It is certain that disease would
   not, of itself, be sufficient to teach piety; and hence we infer, that,
   when the obstructions have been removed, the good seed, which had been
   concealed and crushed, springs up. We have a striking instance of this
   in David; for, so long as he is permitted to gratify his lust, we see
   how he indulges without restraint. Every person would have thought
   that, at that time, faith had been altogether banished from his mind;
   and yet, by a short exhortation of the Prophet, he is so suddenly
   recalled to life, that it may easily be inferred, that some spark,
   though it had been choked, still remained in his mind, and speedily
   burst into a flame. So far as relates to the men themselves, they are
   as guilty as if' they had renounced faith and all the grace of the Holy
   Spirit; but the infinite goodness of God prevents the elect from
   falling so low as to be entirely alienated from God. We ought,
   therefore, to be most zealously on our guard not to fall from faith;
   and yet we ought to believe that God restrains his elect by secret
   bridle, that they may not fall to their destruction, and that He always
   cherishes miraculously in their hearts some sparks of faith, which he
   afterwards, at the proper time, kindles anew by the breath of his
   Spirit.

   There are two clauses in this confession. Thomas acknowledges that
   Christ is his Lord, and then, in the second clauses, [219] he ascends
   higher, and calls him also his God. We know in what sense Scripture
   gives to Christ the name of Lord. It is, because the rather hath
   appointed him to be the highest governor, that he may hold all things
   under his dominion., that every knee may bow before him, (Philippians
   2:10,) and., in short, that he may be the Father's vicegerent in
   governing the world. Thus the name Lord properly belongs to him, so far
   as he is the Mediator manifested in the flesh, and the Head of the
   Church. But Thomas, having acknowledged him to be Lord, is immediately
   carried upwards to his eternal Divinity, and justly; for the reason why
   Christ descended to us, and first was humbled, and afterwards was
   placed at the Father's right hand, and obtained dominion over heaven
   and earth, was, that he might exalt us to his own Divine glory, and to
   the glory of the Father. That our faith may arrive at the eternal
   Divinity of Christ., we must begin with that knowledge which is nearer
   and more easily acquired. Thus it has been justly said by some, that by
   Christ Man we are conducted to Christ God, because our faith makes such
   gradual progress that, perceiving Christ on earth, born in a stable,
   and hanging on a cross, it rises to the glory of his resurrection, and,
   proceeding onwards, comes at length to his eternal life and power, in
   which his Divine Majesty is gloriously displayed.

   Yet we ought to believe, that we cannot know Christ as our Lord, in a
   proper manner, without immediately obtaining also a knowledge of his
   Divinity. Nor is there any room to doubt that this ought to be a
   confession common to all believers., when we perceive that it is
   approved by Christ. He certainly would never have endured that the
   Father should be robbed of the honour due to him, and that this honor
   should be falsely and groundlessly conveyed to himself. But he plainly
   ratifies what Thomas said; and, therefore, this passage is abundantly
   sufficient for refuting the madness of Arius; for it is not lawful to
   imagine two Gods. Here also is declared the unity of person in Christ;
   for the same Jesus Christ [220] is called both God and Lord.
   Emphatically, to, he twice calls him his own, MY Lord and MY God!
   declaring, that he speaks in earnest, and with a lively sentiment of
   faith.

   29. Because thou hast seen me, Thomas. Christ blames nothing in Thomas,
   but that he was so slow to believe, that he needed to be violently
   drawn to faith by the experience of the senses; which is altogether at
   variance with the nature of faith. If it be objected, that nothing is
   more unsuitable than to say that faith is a conviction obtained from
   touching and seeing, the answer may be easily obtained from what I have
   already said; for it was not by mere touching or seeing that Thomas was
   brought to believe that Christ is God, but, being awakened from sleep,
   he recalled to remembrance the doctrine which formerly he had almost
   forgotten. Faith cannot flow from a merely experimental knowledge of
   events, but must draw its origin from the word of God. Christ,
   therefore, blames Thomas for rendering less honor to the word of God
   than he ought to have done, and for having regarded faith -- which
   springs from hearing, and ought to be wholly fixed on the word -- as
   bound to the other senses.

   Blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed Here Christ
   commends faith on this ground, that it acquiesces in the bare word, and
   does not depend on carnal views or human reason [221] He therefore
   includes, in a short definition, the power and nature of faith; namely,
   that it does not rest satisfied with the immediate exercise of sight,
   but penetrates even to heaven, so as to believe those things which are
   hidden from the human senses. And, indeed, we ought to give to God this
   honor, that we should view His truth as (autopistos [222] ) beyond all
   doubt without any other proof [223] Faith has, indeed, its own sight
   but one which does not confine its view to the world, and to earthly
   objects. For this reason it is called

   a demonstration of things invisible or not seen,
   (Hebrews 11:1;)

   and Paul contrasts it with sight, (2 Corinthians 5:7,) meaning, that it
   does not rest satisfied with looking at the condition of present
   object, and does not cast its eye in all directions to those things
   which are visible in the world, but depends on the mouth of God, and,
   relying on His word, rises above the whole world, so as to fix its
   anchor in heaven. It amounts to this, that faith is not of a right
   kind, unless it be founded on the word of God, and rise to the
   invisible kingdom of God, so as to go beyond all human capacity.

   If it be objected, that this saying of Christ is inconsistent with
   another of his sayings, in which he declares that the eyes which behold
   him are blessed, (Matthew 13:16,) I answer, Christ does not there speak
   merely of bodily sight, as he does in this passage, but of revelation,
   which is common to all believers, since he appeared to the world as a
   Redeemer. He draws a comparison between the Apostles and the holy kings
   and prophets, (Matthew 13:17,) who had been kept under the dark shadows
   of the Mosaic Law. He says, that now the condition of believers is much
   more desirable, because a brighter light shines around them, or rather,
   because the substance and truth of the figures was made known to them.
   There were many unbelievers who, at that time, beheld Christ with the
   eyes of flesh, and yet were not more blessed on that account; but we,
   who have never beheld Christ with the eyes, enjoy that blessedness of
   which Christ speaks with commendation. Hence it follows, that he calls
   those eyes blessed which spiritually behold in him what is heavenly and
   divine; for we now behold Christ in the Gospel in the same manner as if
   he visibly stood before us. In this sense Paul says to the Galatians,
   (Galatians 3:1,) that Christ was crucified before their eyes; and,
   therefore, if we desire to see in Christ what may render us happy and
   blessed, let us learn to believe, when we do not see. To these words of
   Christ corresponds what is stated in another passage, in which the
   Apostle commends believers, who

   love Christ whom they have not seen, and rejoice with unspeakable joy,
   though they do not behold him.
   (1 Peter 1:8.)

   The manner in which the Papists torture these words, to prove their
   doctrine of transubstantiation, is exceedingly absurd. That we may be
   blessed, they bid us believe that Christ is present under the
   appearance of bread. But we know that nothing was farther from Christ's
   intention than to subject faith to the inventions of men; and as soon
   as it passes, in the smallest degree, beyond the limits of the word, it
   ceases to be faith. If we must believe without reserve all that we do
   not see, then every monster which men may be pleased to form, every
   fable which they may contrive, will hold our faith in bondage. That
   this saying of Christ may apply to the case in hand, we must first
   prove from the word of God the very point in question. They bring
   forward the word of God, indeed, in support of their doctrine of
   transubstantiation; but when the word is properly expounded, it gives
   no countenance to their foolish notion.

   John 20:30-31

   30. Many other signs also Jesus did in the presence of the disciples,
   which are not written in this book. 31. But these are written, that you
   may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that,
   believing, you may have life through his name.


   30. Many other signs also Jesus did. If the Evangelist had not
   cautioned his readers by this observation, they might have supposed
   that he had left out none of the miracles which Christ had performed,
   and had given a full and complete account of all that happened. John,
   therefore, testifies, first, that he has only related some things out
   of a large number; not that the others were unworthy of being recorded,
   but because these were sufficient to edify faith. And yet it does not
   follow that they were performed in vain, for they profited that age.
   Secondly, though at the present day we have not a minute knowledge of
   them, still we must not suppose it to be of little importance for us to
   know that the Gospel was sealed by a vast number of miracles.

   31. But these are written, that you may believe. By these words he
   means, that he committed to writing what ought to satisfy us, because
   it is abundantly sufficient for confirming our faith; for he intended
   to reply to the vain curiosity of men, which is insatiable, and allows
   itself excessive indulgence. Besides, John was well aware of what the
   other Evangelists had written; and, as nothing was farther from his
   intention than to set aside their writings, he unquestionably does not
   separate their narrative from his own.

   It may be thought strange, however, that faith is founded on miracles,
   while it ought to rest exclusively on the promises and word of God. I
   reply, no other use is here assigned to miracles than to be the aids
   and supports of faith; for they serve to prepare the minds of men, that
   they may cherish greater reverence for the word of God, and we know how
   cold and sluggish our attention is, if we be not excited by something
   else. Besides, it adds no small authority to the doctrine already
   received, when, for the purpose of supporting it, he stretches out his
   mighty hand from heaven; as Mark says that the Apostles taught,

   the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by accompanying
   signs,
   (Mark 16:20.)

   Although, therefore, strictly speaking, faith rests on the word of God,
   and looks to the word as its only end, still the addition of miracles
   is not superfluous, provided that they be also viewed as relating to
   the word, and direct faith towards it. Why miracles are called signs we
   have already explained. It is because, by means of them, the Lord
   arouses men to contemplate his power, when he exhibits any thing
   strange and unusual.

   That Jesus is the Christ. He means the Christ, such as he had been
   promised in the Law and the Prophets, as the Mediator between God and
   men, the Father's highest Ambassador the only Restorer of the world,
   and the Author of perfect happiness. For John did not seize upon an
   empty and unmeaning title to adorn the Son of God, but included, under
   the name Christ, all the offices which the Prophets ascribe to him. We
   ought, therefore, to contemplate him such as he is there described.
   This shows more fully what was said a little ago, that faith does not
   confine its view to miracles, but carries us direct to the word; for it
   is as if John had said, that what the Prophets formerly taught by the
   word has been proved by miracles. And, indeed, we see that the
   Evangelists themselves do not occupy their whole attention in relating
   miracles, but dwell more largely on doe-trine, because miracles by
   themselves would produce nothing but a confused admiration. The meaning
   of the words therefore is, that these things have been written, that we
   may believe, so far as faith can be aided by signs.

   The Son of God. The Evangelist adds this, because not one of the
   ordinary rank of men could have been found, who was competent to
   perform so great undertakings; that is, to reconcile the Father to us,
   to atone for the sins of the world, to abolish death, to destroy the
   kingdom of Satan, to bring to us true righteousness and salvation.
   Besides, as the name, Son of God, belongs only to Christ, it follows
   that he is a Son, not by adoption, but by nature; and, therefore, under
   this name is comprehended the eternal Divinity of Christ. And, indeed,
   he who, after having received those striking proofs, which are to be
   found in the Gospel, does not perceive Christ to be God, does not
   deserve to look even at the sun and the earth, for he is blind amidst
   the brightness of noonday.

   That believing, you may have life. This effect of faith was also added,
   to restrain the foolish longings of men, that they may not desire to
   know more than what is sufficient for obtaining life. For what
   obstinacy was it, not to be satisfied with eternal salvation, and to
   wish to go beyond the limits of the heavenly kingdom? Here John repeats
   the most important point of his doctrine, that we obtain eternal life
   by faith, because, while we are out of Christ, we are dead, and we are
   restored to life by his grace alone. On this subject we have spoken
   largely enough in our exposition of the Third and Fifth Chapters of
   this Gospel.

   Through his name. As to his saying, through the name of Christ, rather
   than through Christ, the reason of this form of expression has been
   assigned by us in our exposition of the twelfth verse of the First
   Chapter of this Gospel. The reader may consult that passage, if he
   think proper, that I may not be troubled with repeating the same things
   frequently. [224]

   CHAPTER 21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 21:1-14

   1. After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples
   at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself thus. 2. Simon Peter,
   and Thomas, who is called Didymus, [225] and Nathanael, who was of Cana
   of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples,
   were together. 3. Simon Peter saith to them, I am going to fish; they
   say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a
   ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 4. And when it
   was morning, Jesus stood on the shore; and the disciples knew not that
   it was Jesus. 5. Jesus saith to them, Children, have you any thing to
   eat? [226] They answered him, No. 6. But he said to them, Cast the net
   on the right side of the ship, and you will find. They cast it,
   therefore; and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of
   fishes. 7. Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It
   is the Lord. When, therefore, Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
   he girded his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and threw himself
   into the sea. 8. And the other disciples carne in the boat, (for they
   were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net
   with fishes. 9. As soon, then, as they came to land, they saw a fire
   burning, and fish laid on it, and bread. 10. Jesus saith to them, Bring
   some of the fish which you have now caught. 11. Simon Peter, therefore,
   went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and
   fifty-three; and although they were so many, the net was not broken.
   12. Jesus saith to them, Come and dine. And not one of the disciples
   dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that he was the Lord. 13. Jesus
   therefore cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth it to them, and fish
   likewise. 14. This is now the third time that Jesus manifested himself
   to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.


   1. After these things Jesus manifested himself again. The Evangelist
   still labors to prove the resurrection of Christ, and relates, that he
   appeared to seven disciples, among whom he mentions Thomas, not out of
   respect to him, so much as because his testimony ought to be the more
   readily believed in proportion to the obstinacy of his unbelief. The
   Evangelist enters sufficiently into detail; for he carefully collects
   all the circumstances which contribute to prove the truth of the
   history. We have formerly mentioned that the Lake of Tiberias,
   according to the Hebrew custom, is called the Sea of Tiberias.

   3. I am going to fish. That Peter gave his attention to fishing, ought
   not to be regarded as inconsistent with his office. By breathing on
   him, Jesus had ordained him to be an Apostle, as we saw a little
   before; but he abstained from the exercise of the apostleship for a
   short time, till he should be clothed with new power. For he had not
   yet been enjoined to appear in public for the discharge of his office
   of teaching, but had only been reminded of his future calling, that he
   and the others might understand that they had not in vain been chosen
   from the beginning. Meanwhile, they do what they were accustomed to do,
   and what belonged to men in private life. It is true that Paul, in the
   midst of his employment as a preacher, gained the support of his life
   by his own hands, but it was for a different reason; for his time was
   so arranged, that the labors of his hands did not withdraw him from
   teaching. Peter and his companions, on the other hand, give themselves
   up entirely to fishing, because they are not hindered from doing so by
   any public employment.

   And that night they caught nothing. God permitted them to toil to no
   purpose during the whole night, in order to prove the truth of the
   miracle; for if they had caught any thing [227] what followed
   immediately afterwards would not have so clearly manifested the power
   of Christ, but when, after having toiled ineffectually during the whole
   night, they are suddenly favored with a large take of fishes, they have
   good reason for acknowledging the goodness of the Lord. In the same
   manner, also, God often tries believers, that he may lead them the more
   highly to value his blessing. If we were always prosperous, whenever we
   put our hand to labor, scarcely any man would attribute to the blessing
   of God the success of his exertions, all would boast of their industry,
   and would kiss their hands. But when they sometimes labor and torment
   themselves without any advantage, if they happen afterwards to succeed
   better, they are constrained to acknowledge something out of the
   ordinary course; and the consequence is, that they begin to ascribe to
   the goodness of God the praise of their prosperity and success.

   6. Cast the net on the right side of the ship. Christ does not command
   with authority and power as Master and Lord, but gives advice like one
   of the people; and the disciples, being at a loss what to do, readily
   obey him, though they did not know who he was. If, before the first
   casting of the net, any thing of this sort had been said to them, they
   would not have so quickly obeyed. I mention this, that no one may
   wonder that they were so submissive, for they had already been worn out
   by long and useless toil. Yet it was no small proof of patience and
   perseverance, that, though they had labored unsuccessfully during the
   whole night, they continue their toil after the return of daylight.
   And, indeed, if we wish to allow an opportunity for the blessing of God
   to descend on us, we ought constantly to expect it; for nothing can be
   more unreasonable than to withdraw the hand immediately from labor, if
   it do not give promise of success.

   That Simon Peter Was Naked, is a proof that the disciples had labored
   in earnest; and yet they do not hesitate to cast the net again to make
   another trial, that they may not neglect any opportunity. Their
   obedience to the command of Christ cannot be ascribed to faith; for
   they hear him speak as a person who was unknown to them. Now, if we
   dislike our calling, because the labor which we undertake appears to be
   unproductive, yet, when the Lord exhorts us to steadiness and
   perseverance, we ought to take courage; in the end we shall obtain a
   happy result, but it will be at the proper time.

   And now they were not able to draw it [228] Christ here exhibited two
   proofs of his Divine power. The first consisted in their taking so
   large a draught of fishes; and the second was, when, by his concealed
   power, he preserved the net whole, which otherwise must unavoidably
   have been broken in pieces. Other circumstances are mentioned, namely,
   that the disciples find burning coals on the shore, that fishes are
   laid on them, and that bread is also prepared. As to the number of the
   fishes, we ought not to look for any deep mystery in it. Augustine
   enters into ingenious reasonings about the statement of the number, and
   says that it denotes the Law and the Gospel; but if we examine the
   matter carefully, we shall find that this is childish trifling.

   7. Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter. The
   Evangelist shows, by his example, that it is our duty to raise our
   hearts to God, whenever we succeed in any thing beyond our expectation;
   because we ought instantly to remember that this act of kindness has
   flowed from the favor of Him who is the Author of every blessing. That
   holy recognition of the grace of God, which dwelt in the heart of John,
   led him also to the knowledge of Christ; for he does not perceive
   Christ with his eyes, but, being convinced that the great multitude of
   fishes has been brought to him by the hand of God, he concludes that it
   was Christ who had guided his hands. But, as John goes before Peter in
   faith, so Peter afterwards excels him in zeal, when, disregarding
   personal danger, he throws himself into the lake. The rest follow in
   the ship. True, all come to Christ at length, but Peter is actuated by
   a peculiar zeal in comparison of the others. Whether he crossed over to
   the shore by walking or by swimming, is uncertain; but let us rest
   satisfied with knowing that the act of leaving the ship and going on
   shore was not the result of folly and rashness, but that he advanced
   beyond the others in proportion to his zeal.

   10. Bring some of the fishes which you have now caught. Though the net
   was filled in a moment, without any great labor on their part yet the
   taking of them is not ascribed by Christ to the disciples, thus, we
   call the bread which we daily eat, OUR bread, and yet, by asking that
   it may be given to us, we acknowledge that it proceeds from the
   blessing of God, (Matthew 6:11.)

   12. And not one of his disciples dared to ask him. It may be inquired,
   What hindered them? Was it shame arising from reverence, or was it any
   thing else? But if Christ saw that they were in a state of uncertainty,
   he ought to remove their doubt, as he had done on many other occasions.
   I reply, there was no other reason for shame, but because they were not
   sufficiently certain that he was the Christ; for it is not usual with
   us to inquire about matters that are doubtful and obscure. The
   Evangelist, therefore, means that the disciples did not ask Christ,
   because they were afraid of doing him wrong; so plain and manifest were
   the signs by which he had made himself known to them.

   14. The third time. The number three refers to the distance of time.
   Christ had already appeared to his disciples more than seven times, but
   all that had been transacted in one day is included in one
   manifestation. The Evangelist, therefore, means that Christ had been
   seen by the disciples at intervals, in order to confirm their belief of
   his resurrection.

   John 21:15-19

   15. When, therefore, they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon
   (son) of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yea,
   Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.
   16. He saith to him again the second time, Simon (son) of John, lovest
   thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He
   saith to him, Feed my sheep. 17. He saith to him the third time, Simon
   (son) of John, [229] lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said
   to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou
   knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him,
   Feed my sheep. 18. Verily, verily, I tell thee, When thou wast young,
   thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when
   thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another will
   gird thee, and will carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 19. And this
   he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God; and when he
   had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me.


   15. When, therefore, they had dined. The Evangelist now relates in what
   manner Peter was restored to that rank of honor from which he had
   fallen. That treacherous denial, which has been formerly described,
   had, undoubtedly, rendered him unworthy of the apostleship; for how
   could he be capable of instructing others in the faith, who had basely
   revolted from it? He had been made an Apostle, but it was along with
   Judas, and from the time when he had abandoned his post, [230] he had
   likewise been deprived of the honor of apostle-ship. Now, therefore,
   the liberty, as well as the authority, of teaching is restored to him,
   both of which he had lost through his own fault. And that the disgrace
   of his apostacy might not stand in his way, Christ blots out and
   destroys the remembrance of it. Such a restoration was necessary, both
   for Peter and for his hearers; for Peter, that he might the more boldly
   execute his office, being assured of the calling with which Christ had
   again invested him; for his hearers, that the stain which attached to
   his person might not be the occasion of despising the Gospel. To us
   also, in the present day, it is of very great importance, that Peter
   comes forth to us as a new man, from whom the disgrace that might have
   lessened his authority has been removed.

   Simon (son) of John [231] lovest thou me? By these words Christ means
   that no man can faithfully serve the Church, and employ himself in
   feeding the flock, if he do not look higher than to men. First, the
   office of feeding [232] is in itself laborious and troublesome; since
   nothing is more difficult than to keep men under the yoke of God, among
   whom there are many who are weak, others who are wanton and unsteady,
   others who are dull and sluggish, and others who are slow and
   unteachable. Satan now brings forward as many causes of offense as he
   can, that he may destroy or weaken the courage of a good pastor. [233]
   In addition to this, we must take into account the ingratitude of many
   and other causes of disgust. No man, therefore, will steadily persevere
   in the discharge of this office, unless the love of Christ shall reign
   in his heart, in such a manner that, forgetful of himself and devoting
   himself entirely to Christ, he overcomes every obstacle. Thus Paul
   declares this to have been the state of his own feelings, when he says,

   The love of Christ constraineth us, judging thus, that if one died for
   all,
   then all must have been dead,
   (2 Corinthians 5:14.)

   For, though he means that love with which Christ hath loved us, and of
   which he hath given us a proof by his death, yet he connects with us
   that mutual love which springs from the conviction of having received
   so great a blessing. Ungodly and false teachers, on the other hand, are
   pointed out by him in another passage by this mark, that they do not
   love the Lord Jesus, (1 Corinthians 16:22.)

   Those who are called to govern the Church ought, therefore, to remember
   that, if they are desirous to discharge their office properly and
   faithfully, they must begin with the love of Christ. Meanwhile, Christ
   openly testifies how highly he values our salvation, when he employs
   such earnest and striking language in recommending it to Pastors, and
   when he declares that, if the salvation of their flock be the object of
   their earnest solicitude, he will reckon it a proof of the ardor of
   their love to himself. And, indeed, nothing could have been spoken that
   was better fitted for encouraging the ministers of the Gospel, than to
   inform them that no service can be more agreeable to Christ than that
   which is bestowed on feeding his flock. All believers ought to draw
   from it no ordinary consolation, when they are taught that they are so
   dear and so precious in the sight of the Son of God, that he
   substitutes them, as it were, in his own room. But the same doctrine
   ought greatly to alarm false teachers, who corrupt and overturn the
   government of the Church; for Christ, who declares that he is insulted
   by them, will inflict on them dreadful punishment.

   Feed my lambs. The word feed is metaphorically applied by Scripture to
   any kind of government; but as the present subject is the spiritual
   government of the Church, it is of importance to observe what are the
   parts of which the office of pastor or shepherd consists. No idle rank
   is here described to us, nor does Christ bestow on a mortal man any
   government to be exercised by him in a confused manner according to his
   own pleasure. In expounding the Tenth Chapter, we have seen that Christ
   is the only Pastor or Shepherd of the Church. [234] We have seen also
   why he takes this name to himself. If, is, because he feeds, that is,
   he governs his sheep, because he is the only true food of the soul. But
   because he employs the agency of men in preaching doctrine, he conveys
   to them also his own name, or, at least, shares it with them. Those
   men, therefore, are reckoned to be Pastors in the sight of God, who
   govern the Church by the ministry of the word under Christ, who is
   their Head. Hence we may easily infer what is the burden which Christ
   lays on Peter, and on what condition he appoints him to govern his
   flock.

   This enables us plainly to refute the wicked adherents of the Church of
   Rome, who torture this passage to support the tyranny of their Popery.
   "To Peter" they tell us, "in preference to others, it is said, Feed my
   sheep " We have already explained the reason why it was said to him
   rather than to the others; namely, that being free from every
   disgraceful stain, he might boldly preach the Gospel; and the reason
   why Christ thrice appoints him to be a pastor is, that the three
   denials, by which Peter had brought on himself everlasting shame, may
   be set aside, and thus may form no barrier to his apostleship, as has
   been judiciously observed by Chrysostom, Augustine, and Cyril, and most
   of the other Commentators. Besides, nothing was given to Peter by these
   words, that is not also given to all the ministers of the Gospel.

   In vain, therefore, do the Papists maintain that he holds the highest
   rank, because he alone is specially addressed; and, granting that some
   special honor was conferred on him, how, I ask, will they prove from
   this that he has been elevated to the primacy? Though he were the chief
   among the apostles, does it thence follow that he was the universal
   bishop of the whole world? To this it must be added, that all that
   Peter received does not belong to the Pope any more than to Mahomet;
   for on what ground does he claim to be Peter's heir, and what man of
   sound understanding will admit that Christ here bestows on him any
   hereditary right? Yet he wishes to be reckoned Peter's successor: I
   wish he were so. None of us hinders him from loving Christ, and from
   taking care to feed his flock; but to take no concern about loving
   Christ, and to throw aside the office of feeding, and then to boast of
   being Peter's successor, is excessively foolish and absurd. Now, as
   Christ, in assigning to Peter the duty of teaching, did not intend to
   erect a throne for an idol or for a murderer of souls, that by means of
   it he might miserably oppress the Church, so he stated in a few words,
   what kind of government of the Church he approves. This removes the
   mask from all the mitred bishops, who, satisfied with a mere theatrical
   display and an empty title, claim for themselves the authority of
   bishops.

   16. Feed my sheep. Christ does not give to Peter and others the office
   of feeding all sorts of persons, but only his sheep or his lambs. He
   elsewhere describes who they are whom he reckons to belong to his
   flock.

   My sheep, says he, hear my voice, and follow me; they hear not the
   voice of a stranger,
   (John 10:5, 27.)

   True, faithful teachers ought to endeavor to gather all to Christ; and
   as they cannot distinguish between sheep and wild beasts, they ought to
   try by all methods if they can tame those who resemble wolves rather
   than sheep. But after having put forth their utmost efforts, their
   labor will be of no avail to any but the elect sheep; for docility and
   faith arise from this, that the heavenly Father delivers to his Son,
   that they may obey him, those whom he elected before the creation of
   the world. Again, we are taught by this passage, that none can be fed
   to salvation by the doctrine of the Gospel but those who are mild and
   teachable; for it is not without reason that Christ compares his
   disciples to lambs and sheep; but it must also be observed, that the
   Spirit of God tames those who by nature were bears or lions.

   17. Peter was grieved. Peter undoubtedly did not perceive the object
   which Christ had in view, in putting the same question so frequently;
   and therefore he thinks that he is-in-directly accused, as if he had
   not answered with sincerity. But we have already showed that the
   repetition was not superfluous. Besides, Peter was not yet sufficiently
   aware how deeply the love of Christ must be engraven on the hearts of
   those who have to struggle against innumerable difficulties. He
   afterwards learned by long experience, that such a trial had not been
   made in vain. Those who are to undertake the charge of governing the
   Church are also taught, in his person, not to examine themselves
   slightly, but to make a thorough scrutiny what zeal they possess, that
   they may not shrink or faint in the middle of their course. We are
   likewise taught, that we ought patiently and mildly to submit, if at
   any time the Lord subject us to a severe trial; because he has good
   reasons for doing so, though they are generally unknown to us.

   18. Verily, verily, I tell thee. After having exhorted Peter to feed
   his sheep, Christ likewise arms him to maintain the warfare which was
   approaching. Thus he demands from him not only faithfulness and
   diligence, but invincible courage in the midst of dangers, and firmness
   in bearing the cross. In short, he bids him be prepared for enduring
   death whenever it shall be necessary. Now, though the condition of all
   pastors is not alike, still this admonition applies to all in some
   degree. The Lord spares many, and abstains from shedding their blood,
   satisfied with this alone, that they devote themselves to him sincerely
   and unreservedly as long as they live. But as Satan continually makes
   new and various attacks, all who undertake the office of feeding must
   be prepared for death; as they certainly have to do not only with
   sheep, but also with wolves. So far as relates to Peter, Christ
   intended to forewarn him of his death, that he might at all times
   ponder the thought, that the doctrine of which he was a minister must
   be at length ratified by his own blood. Yet it appears that in these
   words Christ did not speak with a view to Peter alone, but that he
   adorned him with the honourable title of Martyr in presence of the
   others; as if he had said, that Peter would be a very different kind of
   champion from what he had formerly shown himself to be.

   When thou wast younger. Old age appears to be set apart for
   tranquillity and repose; and, accordingly, old men are usually
   discharged from public employments, and soldiers are discharged from
   service. Peter might, therefore, have promised to himself at that age a
   peaceful life. Christ declares, on the other hand, that the order of
   nature will be inverted, so that he who had lived at his ease when he
   was young will be governed by the will of another when he is old, and
   will even endure violent subjection.

   In Peter we have a striking mirror of our ordinary condition. Many have
   an easy and agreeable life before Christ calls them; but as soon as
   they have made profession of his name, and have been received as his
   disciples, or, at least, some time afterwards, they are led to
   distressing struggles, to a troublesome life, to great dangers, and
   sometimes to death itself. This condition, though hard, must be
   patiently endured. Yet the Lord moderates the cross by which he is
   pleased to try his servants, so that he spares them a little while,
   until their strength has come to maturity; for he knows well their
   weakness, and beyond the measure of it he does not press them. Thus he
   forbore with Peter, so long as he saw him to be as yet tender and weak.
   Let us therefore learn to devote ourselves to him to the latest breath,
   provided that he supply us with strength.

   In this respect, we behold in many persons base ingratitude; for the
   more gently the Lord deals with us, the more thoroughly do we habituate
   ourselves to softness and effeminacy. Thus we scarcely find one person
   in a hundred who does not murmur if, after having experienced long
   forbearance, he be treated with some measure of severity. But we ought
   rather to consider the goodness of God in sparing us for a time. Thus
   Christ says that, so long as he dwelt on earth, he conversed cheerfully
   with his disciples, as if he had been present at a marriage, but that
   fasting and tears afterwards awaited them, [235] (Matthew 9:15.)

   Another will gird thee. Many think that this denotes the manner of
   death which Peter was to die, [236] meaning that he was hanged, with
   his arms stretched out; but I consider the word gird as simply denoting
   all the outward actions by which a man regulates himself and his whole
   life. Thou girdedst thyself; that is, "thou wast accustomed to wear
   such raiment as thou chosest, but this liberty of choosing thy dress
   will be taken from thee." As to the manner in which Peter was put to
   death, it is better to remain ignorant of it than to place confidence
   in doubtful fables.

   And will lead thee whither thou wouldst not. The meaning is, that Peter
   did not die a natural death, but by violence and by the sword. It may
   be thought strange that Christ should say that Peter's death will not
   be voluntary; for, when one is hurried unwillingly to death, there is
   no firmness and none of the praise of martyrdom. But this must be
   understood as referring to the contest between the flesh and the
   Spirit, which believers feel within themselves; for we never obey God
   in a manner so free and unrestrained as not to be drawn, as it were, by
   ropes, in an opposite direction, by the world and the flesh. Hence that
   complaint of Paul,

   "The good that I would I do not, but the evil that I would not, that I
   do,"
   (Romans 7:19.)

   Besides, it ought to be observed, that the dread of death is naturally
   implanted in us, for to wish to be separated from the body is revolting
   to nature. Accordingly, Christ, though he was prepared to obey God with
   his whole heart, prays that he may be delivered from death. Moreover,
   Peter dreaded the cross on account of the cruelty of men; and,
   therefore, we need not wonder if, in some measure, he recoiled from
   death. But this showed the more clearly the obedience which he rendered
   to God, that he would willingly have avoided death on its own account,
   and yet he endured it voluntarily, because he knew that such was the
   will of God; for if there had not been a struggle of the mind, there
   would have been no need of patience.

   This doctrine is highly useful to be known; for it urges us to prayer,
   because we would never be able, without extraordinary assistance from
   God, to conquer the fear of death; and, therefore, nothing remains for
   us but to present ourselves humbly to God, and to submit to his
   government. It serves also to sustain our minds, that they may not
   altogether faint, if it happen at any time that persecutions make us
   tremble. They who imagine that the martyrs were not moved by any fear
   make their own fear to yield them a ground of despair. But there is no
   reason why our weakness should deter us from following their example,
   since they experienced a fear similar to ours, so that they could not
   gain a triumph over the enemies of truth but by contending with
   themselves.

   19. Signifying by what death he should glorify God. This circumlocution
   is highly emphatic; for though the end held out to all believers ought
   to be, to glorify God both by their life and by their death, yet John
   intended to employ a remarkable commendation for adorning the death of
   those who, by their blood, seal the Gospel of Christ and glorify his
   name, as Paul teaches us, (Philippians 1:20.) It is now our duty to
   reap the fruit which the death of Peter has yielded; for it ought to be
   imputed to our indolence, if our faith be not confirmed by it, and if
   we do not keep the same object in view, that the glory of God may be
   displayed by us. If the Papists had considered this end in the death of
   the martyrs, that sacrilegious and detestable invention would never
   have entered into their minds, that their death contributes to appease
   the wrath of God, and to pay the ransom for our sins.

   And when he had said this. Christ here explains what was the design of
   that prediction of a violent death. It was, that Peter might be
   prepared to endure it; as if he had said, "Since you must endure death
   by my example, follow your leader." Again, that Peter may the more
   willingly obey God who calls him to the cross, Christ offers himself as
   a leader; for this is not a general exhortation by which he invites him
   to imitate himself, but he speaks only of the kind of death. Now, this
   single consideration greatly soothes all the bitterness that is in
   death, when the Son of God presents himself before our eyes with his
   blessed resurrection, which is our triumph over death.

   John 21:20-25

   20. And Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following whom Jesus
   loved, who had also leaned on his breast at the supper, and had said,
   Lord, which is he who betrayeth thee? 21. When, therefore, Peter saw
   him, he said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall he do? 22. Jesus saith to
   him, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to thee? follow
   thou me. 23. Then this saying went forth among the brethren, that that
   disciple would not die; yet Jesus had not said to him that he would not
   die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
   24. This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote
   these things; and we know that his testimony is true. 25. There are
   also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written
   every one, I think that even the world itself would not contain the
   books that would be written.


   20. And Peter, turning about. We have in Peter an instance of our
   curiosity, which is not only superfluous, but even hurtful, when we are
   drawn aside from our duty by looking at others; for it is almost
   natural to us to examine the way in which other people live, instead of
   examining our own, and to attempt to find in them idle excuses. We
   willingly deceive ourselves by this semblance of apology, that other
   people are no better than we are, as if their indolence freed us from
   blame. Scarce one person in a hundred considers the import of those
   words of Paul,

   Every man shall bear his own burden, (Galatians 6:5.)

   In the person of one man, therefore, there is a general reproof of all
   who look around them in every direction, to see how other men act, and
   pay no attention to the duties which God has enjoined on themselves.
   Above all, they are grievously mistaken in this respect, that they
   neglect and overlook what is demanded by every man's special calling.

   Out of ten persons it may happen that God shall choose one, that he may
   try him by heavy calamities or by vast labors, and that he shall permit
   the other nine to remain at ease, or, at least, shall try them lightly.
   Besides, God does not treat all in the same manner, but makes trial of
   every one as he thinks fit. As there are various kinds of Christian
   warfare, let every man learn to keep his own station, and let us not
   make inquiries like busybodies about this or that person, when the
   heavenly Captain addresses each of us, to whose authority we ought to
   be so submissive as to forget every thing else.

   Whom Jesus loved. This circumlocution was inserted, in order to inform
   us what was the reason why Peter was induced to put the question which
   is here related; for he thought it strange that he alone should be
   called, and that John should be overlooked, whom Christ had always
   loved so warmly. Peter had, therefore, some apparently good reason for
   asking why no mention was made of John, as if Christ's disposition
   towards him had undergone a change. Yet Christ cuts short his
   curiosity, by telling him that he ought to obey the calling of God, and
   that he has no right to inquire what other people do.

   22. If I will that he remain. It has been customary to take this
   sentence as detached, and to read the former clause affirmatively, I
   will that he tarry till I come; but this has been done through the
   ignorance of transcribers, not through the mistake of the translator;
   for he could not have been mistaken about the Greek word, but a single
   letter might easily creep into the Latin version, so as to alter the
   whole meaning. [237] The whole sentence, therefore, is a question, and
   ought to be read in immediate connection; for Christ intended to put
   his hand on his disciple, in order to keep him within the limits of his
   calling. "It is no concern of yours," says he, "and you have no right
   to inquire what becomes of your companion; leave that to my disposal;
   think only about yourself, and prepare to follow where you are called."
   Not that all anxiety about brethren is uncalled for but it ought to
   have some limit, so that it may be anxiety, and not curiosity, that
   occupies our attention. Let every man, therefore, look to his
   neighbours, if by any means he may succeed in drawing them along with
   him to Christ, and let not the offenses of others retard his own
   progress.

   23. Then this saying went forth. The Evangelist relates that, from
   misunderstanding Christ's words, an error arose among the disciples,
   that John would never die. He means those who were present at that
   conversation, that is, the Apostles; not that the name brethren belongs
   to them alone, but that they were the first-fruits, as it were, of that
   holy union. It is also possible, that, besides the eleven, he refers to
   others who were at that time in company with them; and by the
   expression, went forth, he means that this error was spread in all
   directions; yet probably it was not of long duration, but subsisted
   among them, until, being enlightened by the Holy Spirit, they formed
   purer and more correct views of the kingdom of Christ, having laid
   aside carnal and foolish imaginations. [238]

   What John relates about the Apostles happens every day, and we ought
   not to wonder at it; for if Christ's disciples, who belonged to his
   family and were intimately acquainted with him, were so egregiously
   mistaken, how much more are they liable to fall into mistakes, who have
   not been so familiarly instructed in the school of Christ? But let us
   also observe whence this fault arises. The teaching of Christ is
   useful, and for edification; that is, it is plain; but we obscure the
   light by our wicked inventions, which we bring to it from our own
   views. Christ had not intended to pronounce any thing certain or
   definite about John, but only to affirm that he had full power to
   decide about his life and death; so that the doctrine is simple and
   useful in itself, but the disciples imagine and contrive more than had
   been told them. Accordingly, in order that we may be safe from this
   danger, let us learn to be wise and to think soberly. But such is the
   wantonness of the human understanding, that it rushes with all its
   force into foolishness. The consequence was, that this very error,
   against which the Evangelist had expressly warned them to be on their
   guard, continued notwithstanding to gain currency in the world; for a
   fable has been contrived, that he ordered a ditch to be digged for him,
   and went down into it, and that next day it was found empty. We see,
   therefore, that we shall never cease to err, unless we unreservedly
   receive what the Lord hath taught us, and reject all inventions of men.

   24. This is that disciple. Having hitherto mentioned himself in the
   third person, John now declares that it is himself; that greater weight
   may be attached to the statements of one who was an eye-witness, and
   who had fully known all that he relates.

   25. There are also many other things that Jesus did. Lest any one
   should view his narrative with suspicion, as if it had been written
   through partiality, because Jesus loved him, he anticipates this
   objection, by saying, that he has passed over more than he has written.
   He does not speak of Christ's actions of every kind, but of those which
   relate to his public office; nor ought we to think that the hyperbole
   is absurd, when we bear with many figures of speech of the same kind in
   heathen authors. Not only ought we to take into account the number of
   Christ's works, but we ought also to consider their importance and
   magnitude. The majesty of Christ, which by its infinity swallowed up,
   if I may so speak, not only the senses of men, but heaven and earth,
   gave a miraculous display of its own splendor in those works. If the
   Evangelist, casting his eyes on that brightness, exclaims in
   astonishment, that even the whole world could not contain a full
   narrative, ought we to wonder at it? Nor is he at all to be blamed, if
   he employ a frequent and ordinary figure of speech for commending the
   excellence of the works of Christ. For we know how God accommodates
   himself to the ordinary' way of speaking, on account of our ignorance,
   and sometimes even, if I may be allowed the expression, stammers.

   Yet we ought to remember what we formerly stated, that the summary
   which the Evangelists have committed to writing, is sufficient both for
   regulating faith and for obtaining salvation. That man who has duly
   profited under such teachers will be truly wise. And, indeed, since
   they were appointed by God to be witnesses to us, as they have
   faithfully discharged their duty; so it is our duty, on the other hand,
   to depend wholly on their testimony, and to desire nothing more than
   what they have handed down to us; and especially, because their pens
   were guided by the sure providence of God, that they might not oppress
   us by an unlimited mass of narratives, and yet, in making a selection,
   might make known to us all that God knew to be necessary for us, who
   alone is wise, and the only fountain of wisdom; to whom be praise and
   glory for ever. Amen.
