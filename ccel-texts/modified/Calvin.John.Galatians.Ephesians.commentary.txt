   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   The extraordinary ability and skill displayed by Calvin, in his
   Commentaries on the Inspired Writings, have been set forth by almost
   all the Translators of this Series. I have always thought, and am happy
   to have the support of his latest Editor, Dr. Tholuck, that he is more
   successful in expounding the Epistles Of Paul than in any other portion
   of Scripture. This might arise in part from having studied them with
   uncommon ardor and perseverance. The times in which he lived held out
   strong inducements to examine the great peculiarities of the Christian
   Faith. And where were these so likely to be found as in the writings of
   an Apostle whom the Spirit of God employed, more than all the others,
   in unfolding to the Church "the unsearchable riches of Christ?"
   (Ephesians 3:8.)

   How far that success might be promoted by the resemblance of character
   which an able and eloquent writer [1] asserts to have existed between
   the great Apostle and the Reformer, I leave undetermined. But the chief
   cause unquestionably lay in his singularly clear perception of that
   scheme of doctrine which Paul was honored to declare. This enabled him
   to penetrate the design of the Apostle, and to follow closely the
   course of his argument. In discussions of the greatest intricacy he
   seldom loses his way.

   Various authors, who cannot be named without awakening gratitude, and
   to whom it would be impossible to do justice in this brief sketch, have
   supplied the materials of valuable Notes to this volume. From their
   pages it would have been easy to select many a warm tribute to the
   Genevan Reformer, to whom they were deeply indebted, and whose writings
   were consulted by them with acknowledged deference. The greatest lights
   of our age have not superseded the labors of Calvin, and ablest divines
   vie with each other in doing homage to his great sagacity as an
   interpreter of the Holy Scriptures.

   To my younger brethren in the ministry may I take the liberty of
   recommending these Commentaries as an excellent model for expounding
   the inspired Epistles? The frequent mention of Popery does not lessen
   the value of this recommendation. How far it may be necessary, at all
   times, to fortify our hearers against the attacks of the "man of sin,"
   (2 Thessalonians 2:3,) I do not now stay to inquire. But as a skillful,
   natural, and impressive application of divine truth to the
   controversies of the day, the warnings against Popery deserve careful
   study. They are appropriately introduced, and serve to illustrate more
   fully the mind of the Spirit.

   In describing them as models, it may be proper to mention that they are
   strictly what their title bears, Commentaries, unaccompanied by those
   illustrations which, in public instruction, are indispensably
   necessary. To devout minds they will have many attractions. They are
   imbued with the ardent piety and that copious use of the language of
   Scripture by which all the writings of Calvin are so eminently
   distinguished.

   TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE

   CHRISTOPER,

   DUKE OF WIRTEMBERG, EARL OF MONTEBELIARD, ETC.

   Though personally unknown to you, most illustrious Prince, I venture
   unhesitatingly [2] to dedicate to you one of my productions. It may be
   thought that so bold a step will be censured by some persons as rash,
   and therefore demands an apology. Nothing is more easy. A few words
   shall suffice. My motives to address you are chiefly two.

   You have hitherto, indeed, pursued the right course with great spirit
   and energy. Yet I thought that it might not be altogether unnecessary
   to excite you, by a direct appeal, to the perusal of a work not a
   little fitted to strengthen your resolutions. One advantage you
   possess, in the kind providence of God, above most princes of the
   present day. Having enjoyed an early and liberal education in the Latin
   language, you are enabled to employ your leisure in reading profitable
   and religious books. If ever there was a time when the consolations
   derived from religious instruction were necessary, what other resource
   is left to the most heroic minds by the present distress of the Church,
   and by greater and heavier distresses which appear to be approaching?
   Whoever, therefore, wishes to remain unmoved to the last, let him rely
   entirely on this support; whoever desires to have a sure protection,
   let him learn to betake himself to this refuge. Besides, in these four
   Epistles, [3] of which I now present to you my Expositions, you will
   find, noble Prince, many subjects of consolation exceedingly adapted to
   the present times; but to which I do not now more particularly refer,
   because they will occur to yourself with much better effect in their
   own places.

   I come now to my second reason for dedicating to you this work. During
   the present confusion of affairs, while some are shaken, and others are
   entirely thrown down, you have preserved an astonishing composure and
   moderation, accompanied by a remarkable steadfastness, amidst all the
   storms which have arisen. I consider, therefore, that it is highly
   advantageous to the whole Church, to hold out in you, as in a bright
   mirror, an example which all may imitate. For, while the Son of God
   enjoins on all his followers, without exception, that they shall choose
   rather to fight under the banner of his cross than to triumph with the
   world, yet very few are found who are ready to engage in that kind of
   warfare. It is the more necessary that all should be stimulated and
   taught, by such uncommon examples as yours, to correct their
   effeminacy.

   Of my Commentaries I shall only say, that they perhaps contain more
   than it would become me to acknowledge. On this point, however, I wish
   you to read and judge for yourself. Farewell, most illustrious Prince.
   May the Lord Jesus long preserve you for himself and his Church, and
   guide you by His Spirit!

   Geneva,
   1st February 1548.

   THE ARGUMENT

   OF

   THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE GALATIANS.

   What part of Asia was inhabited by the Galatians, and what were the
   boundaries of their country, is well known; but whence they originally
   came [4] is not agreed among historians. It is universally admitted
   that they were Gauls, and, on that account, were denominated
   Gallo-Grecians. But from what part of Gaul they came it is more
   difficult to determine.

   Strabo thought that the Tectosages came from Gallia Narbonensis, and
   that the remainder were Celtae; [5] and this opinion has been generally
   adopted. But, as Pliny enumerates the Ambiani [6] among the Tectosagi,
   and as it is universally agreed that they were allied to the
   Tolistobogi, who dwelt on the banks of the Rhine, I think it more
   probable that, they were Belgians, whose territory extended from a very
   distant part of the course of the Rhine to the English Channel. The
   Tolistobogi inhabited that part which receives from its present
   inhabitants the names of Cleves and Brabant.

   The mistake originated, I think, in this way. A band of Tectosagi, who
   had made all irruption into Gallia Narbonensis, retained their own
   name, and gave it to the country which they had conquered. This is
   intimated by Ausonius, [7] who says, "As far as the Teutosagi, whose
   original name was Belgians; [8] for he calls them Belgians, and says
   that they were first called Teutosagi, and afterwards Tectosagi.
   Caesar, [9] indeed, places the Tectosagi in the Hercynian [10] forest;
   but I consider this to have been in consequence of their emigration,
   which indeed appears from that very passage.

   But more than enough has now been said as to the origin of the nation,
   so far as relates to the present passage. Pliny informs us that the
   Galatians, who inhabited that part of Asia to which they gave their
   name, were divided into three chief nations, Tectosagi, Tolistobogi,
   and Trocmi, and accordingly occupied three chief cities. So great was
   the power which they at one time swayed over their unwarlike neighbors,
   that they received tribute from a great part of Lesser Asia. Losing at
   length their ancient valor, and giving themselves up to pleasure and
   luxury, they were vanquished in war and subdued, with little
   difficulty, by Cneius Manlius, a Roman consul.

   At the time of the Apostle Paul they were under the dominion of the
   Romans. He had purely and faithfully instructed them in the Gospel; but
   false apostles had entered, during his absence, and had corrupted the
   true seed by false and erroneous doctrines. They taught that the
   observation of ceremonies was still necessary. This might appear to be
   a trivial matter; but Paul very properly contends as for a fundamental
   article of the Christian faith. It is no small evil to quench the light
   of the Gospel, to lay a snare for consciences, and to remove the
   distinction between the Old and New Testaments. He perceived that these
   errors were also connected with a wicked and dangerous opinion as to
   the manner in which justification is obtained. This is the reason why
   he fights with so much earnestness and vehemence; and, having learned
   from him the important and serious nature of the controversy, it is our
   duty to read with greater attention.

   One who forms his views of the subject from the Commentaries of Origen
   and Jerome, will be astonished that Paul should take so deep an
   interest in external rites; but whoever goes to the fountain will
   acknowledge that there was abundant reason for all this sharpness of
   reproof. The Galatians had allowed themselves to be drawn aside from
   the right course by excessive credulity, or rather by lightness and
   folly. He therefore censures them more severely; for I do not agree
   with those who attribute the harshness of his language to their
   slowness of apprehension. The Ephesians and Colossians had been
   subjected to the same temptations. If they had lent as ready an ear to
   the tale of the impostors, do we imagine that Paul would have treated
   them with greater gentleness? This boldness of rebuke was not suggested
   by the disposition of the people, but extorted by the baseness of their
   conduct.

   Having ascertained what was the design of writing the Epistle, let us
   attend to the order in which it is treated. In the first and second
   Chapters (Galatians 1 and Galatians 2) he maintains the authority of
   his Apostleship, except that, towards the close of the second chapter,
   he touches incidentally on his main point, the question of Man's
   Justification, which, however, is avowedly and directly argued in the
   third Chapter, Galatians 3. Although he appears in those two Chapters
   to have many objects in view, yet his sole object is to prove that He
   is equal to the highest apostles, and that there is no reason why he
   should not be considered to hold an equally honorable rank with any of
   them.

   But it is of importance to know why he labors so hard in establishing
   his own claim to respect. Provided that Christ reigns, and that the
   purity of doctrine remains uncontaminated, what matters it whether he
   is higher or lower than Peter, or whether they are all on a footing of
   equality? If all must "decrease," that Christ alone may "increase,"
   (John 3:30,) it is idle to dispute about human ranks. Besides, it may
   be asked, why does he draw a comparison between himself and other
   apostles? What dispute had he with Peter, and James, and John? What
   good purpose did it serve to bring into collision those who were united
   in sentiment, and in the closest friendship?

   I reply, the false apostles, who had deceived the Galatians, endeavored
   to obtain favor by pretending that they had received a commission from
   the Apostles. Their chief influence arose from insinuating the belief
   that they represented the Apostles, and delivered their message. To
   Paul, on the other hand, they refused the name and authority of an
   Apostle. They objected that he had not been chosen by our Lord as one
   of the Twelve; that he had never been acknowledged as such by the
   college of the Apostles; that he did not receive his doctrine from
   Christ, or even from the Apostles themselves. All this tended not only
   to lower Paul's authority, but to rank him with the ordinary members of
   the Church, and therefore to place him far below those persons who made
   these insinuations.

   If this had been merely a personal matter, it would have given no
   uneasiness to Paul to be reckoned an ordinary disciple. But when he saw
   that his doctrine was beginning to lose its weight and authority, he
   was not entitled to be silent. It became his duty to make a bold
   resistance. When Satan does not venture openly to attack doctrine, his
   next stratagem is to diminish its influence by indirect attacks. Let us
   remember, then, that in the person of Paul the truth of the Gospel was
   assailed; for, if he had allowed himself to be stripped of the honor of
   apostleship, it followed that he had hitherto claimed what he had no
   title to enjoy; and this false boasting would have made him liable to
   suspicion in other matters. The estimation in which his doctrine was
   held depended on the question, whether it came, as some had begun to
   think, from an ordinary disciple, or from an apostle of Christ.

   He was overwhelmed, on the other hand, by the lustre of great names.
   Those who referred, in a boastful manner, to Peter, and James, and
   John, pretended to apostolical authority. If Paul had not manfully
   resisted this boasting, he would have given way to falsehood, and would
   have allowed the truth of God [11] to suffer again in his own person.
   He therefore contends earnestly for both points: that he was appointed
   by the Lord to be an apostle, and that he was in no respect inferior to
   the rest, but enjoyed the same title, and was equal to them in
   authority and rank. He might, indeed, have denied that those men were
   either sent, or hold any commission from Peter and his associates. But
   he takes far higher ground, that he does not yield to the Apostles
   themselves; and if he had declined doing so, he would have been
   supposed to have distrusted his cause.

   Jerusalem was, at that time, the Mother of all the Churches; for the
   Gospel had spread from it over the whole world, and it might be said to
   be the principal seat of the kingdom of Christ. Any one who came from
   it into other churches was received with due respect. But many were
   foolishly elated with the thought that they had enjoyed the friendship
   of the Apostles, or at least had been taught in their school; and
   therefore nothing pleased them but what they had seen at Jerusalem.
   Every custom that had not been practiced there was not only disliked,
   but unsparingly condemned by them. This peevish manner becomes highly
   pernicious, when the custom of a single church is attempted to be
   enforced as a universal law. We are sometimes so devoted to an
   instructor or a place, that, without exercising any judgment of our
   own, we make the opinion of one man the standard for all men, and the
   customs of one place the standard for every other place. Such
   attachment is ridiculous, if there be not always in it a mixture of
   ambition; or rather we should say, excessive peevishness is always
   ambitious.

   To return to those false apostles, if they had only attempted, through
   wicked contention, to establish everywhere the use of those ceremonies,
   which they had seen observed at Jerusalem, that would have been no
   slight offense; for, when a custom is forthwith converted into a law,
   injustice is perpetrated. But a more serious evil was involved in the
   wicked and dangerous doctrine, which held consciences to be bound to
   them by religious considerations, which made justification to depend on
   the observation of them. Such were the reasons why Paul defended his
   Apostleship with so much earnestness, and why he contrasted himself
   with the rest of the Apostles.

   He pursues this subject to the end of the second Chapter, Galatians 2,
   when he proceeds to argue the doctrine, that we are justified in the
   sight of God by Free Grace, and not by the Works of the Law. His
   argument is this: If Ceremonies have not the power of bestowing
   Justification, the observation of them is therefore unnecessary. We
   must remark, however, that he does not confine himself entirely to
   Ceremonies, but argues generally about Works, otherwise the whole
   discussion would be trifling.

   If any person thinks that we are thus straining the matter too far, let
   him attend to the two following reasons. First, the question could not
   be settled without assuming the general principle, that we are
   justified by the free grace of God; and this principle sets aside not
   only ceremonies, but every other kind of works. Secondly, Paul did not
   attach so much importance to Ceremonies as to the wicked doctrine of
   obtaining Salvation by Works. Let it be observed, therefore, that Paul
   had good reasons for recurring to first principles. It was necessary to
   go to the fountain, and to warn his readers that the controversy
   related, not to some insignificant trifle, but to the most important of
   all matters -- the method of obtaining salvation.

   It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that the Apostle confined
   himself wholly to the special question about Ceremonies, a subject
   which did not admit of being settled by itself. A similar instance
   occurs in history. (Acts 15:2.) Strife and contention had arisen out of
   the question, whether or not Ceremonies were necessary to be observed.
   In the course of the discussion, the Apostles dwell largely on the
   intolerable yoke of the Law, and on the Forgiveness of Sins through
   Free Grace. What was the object of this? It appears to be a foolish
   departure from the point in hand; but the contrary is the fact, for a
   particular error cannot be satisfactorily refuted without assuming a
   universal principle. As, for instance, if I am called to dispute about,
   forbidding the use of flesh, I shall not speak merely about the
   different kinds of food, but shall arm myself with the general
   doctrine: What authority have the Traditions of men for binding the
   conscience? I shall quote the declaration, that

   "There is one Lawgiver, who has power to save and to destroy." (James
   4:12.)

   In short, Paul here argues negatively from general to particular
   propositions, which is the ordinary and most natural method of
   reasoning. By what evidences and arguments he proves this principle,
   that we are justified by the grace of God alone, we shall see when we
   come to the passage. He pursues this topic till the end of the third
   Chapter, Galatians 3.

   In the commencement of the fourth Chapter, Galatians 4, he inquires
   into the proper use of Ceremonies, and the reason why they were
   appointed; shewing, at the same time, that they are now abolished. It
   became necessary to meet this silly objection, which might occur to
   some minds. What, then, was the purpose of Ceremonies? Were they
   useless? Were the Fathers idly employed in observing them? He
   illustrates briefly two statements, that in their own time they were
   not superfluous, and that they have now been abolished by the coming of
   Christ, because He is the truth and end of them; and therefore he shews
   that we must abide by Him. Glancing briefly at the difference between
   our condition and that of the Fathers, he infers that the doctrine of
   the false apostles is wicked and dangerous, because it darkens the
   clearness of the gospel by ancient shadows. The Apostle's doctrine is
   now intermingled with some affecting exhortations. Towards the close of
   the Chapter his argument is enlivened by a beautiful allegory.

   In the fifth Chapter, Galatians 5, he exhorts them to hold fast the
   Liberty which has been obtained by the blood of Christ, that they may
   not surrender their consciences to be ensnared by the opinions of men.
   But he reminds them, at the same time, in what manner Liberty may be
   lawfully used. [12] He then takes occasion to point out the proper
   employments of Christians, that they may not uselessly spend their time
   in Ceremonies, and neglect matters of real importance.

   COMMENTARIES ON THE

   EPISTLE OF PAUL

   TO THE GALATIANS.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Galatians 1:1-5

   1. Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,
   and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,)

   1. Paulus apostolus, non ab hominibus, neque per hominem, sed per Iesum
   Christum, et Deum Patrem, qui suscitavit illum ex mortuis,

   2. And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
   Galatia:

   2. Et qui mecum sunt fratres omnes, ecclesiis Galatiae:

   3. Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord
   Jesus Christ,

   3. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre, et Domino nostro Iesu Christo,

   4. Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
   present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:

   4. Qui dedit se ipsum pro peccatis nostris, ut nos eriperet a praesenti
   saeculo maligno, secundum voluntatem Dei et Patris nostri,

   5. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   5. Cui gloria in saecula saeculorum. Amen.


   1. Paul, an apostle. In the salutations with which he commenced his
   Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of "an Apostle." His
   object in doing so, as we have remarked on former occasions, was to
   employ the authority of his station, for the purpose of enforcing his
   doctrine. This authority depends not on the judgment or opinion of men,
   but exclusively on the calling of God; and therefore he demands a
   hearing on the ground of his being "an Apostle." Let us always bear
   this in mind, that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and
   to Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed to be our teacher. Whoever
   assumes a right to instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of
   Christ.

   But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently disputed among the
   Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that church,
   than in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm that he was
   called by God, but states expressly that it was not either from men or
   by men. This statement, be it observed, applies not to the office which
   he held in common with other pastors, but to the apostleship. The
   authors of the calumnies which he has in his eye did not venture to
   deprive him altogether of the honor of the Christian ministry. They
   merely refused to allow him the name and rank of an apostle.

   We are now speaking of the apostleship in the strictest sense; for the
   word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it denotes preachers
   of the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but here it bears a
   distinct reference to the highest rank in the church; so that Paul is
   equal to Peter and to the other twelve.

   The first clause, that he was called not from men, he had in common
   with all the true ministers of Christ. As no man ought to "take this
   honor unto himself," (Hebrews 5:4,) so it is not in the power of men to
   bestow it on whomsoever they choose. It belongs to God alone to govern
   his church; and therefore the calling cannot be lawful, unless it
   proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned, a man who has been
   led to the ministry, not by a good conscience, but by ungodly motives,
   may happen to be regularly called. But Paul is here speaking of a call
   ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that nothing farther can be
   desired.

   It will, perhaps, be objected -- Do not the false apostles frequently
   indulge in the same kind of boasting? I admit they do, and in a more
   haughty and disdainful style than the servants of the Lord venture to
   employ; but they want that actual call from Heaven to which Paul was
   entitled to lay claim.

   The second clause, that he was called not by man, belonged in a
   peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary pastor, this would
   have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling through
   various cities in company with Barnabas, "ordained elders in every
   church," by the votes of the people, (Acts 14:23;) and he enjoins Titus
   and Timothy to proceed in the same work. (1 Timothy 5:17 Titus 1:5.)
   Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for we are not
   entitled to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the names of the
   persons whom he has chosen.

   But if human agency was not improper, if it was even commendable, why
   does Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already mentioned
   that something more was necessary to be proved than that Paul was a
   pastor, or that he belonged to the number of the ministers of the
   Gospel; for the point in dispute was the apostleship. It was necessary
   that the apostles should be elected, not in the same manner as other
   pastors, but by the direct agency of the Lord himself. Thus, Christ
   himself (Matthew 10:1) called the Twelve; and when a successor was to
   be appointed in the room of Judas, the church does not venture to
   choose one by votes, but has recourse to lot. (Acts 1:26.) We are
   certain that the lot was not employed in electing pastors. Why was it
   resorted to in the election of Matthias? To mark the express agency of
   God for it was proper that the apostles should be distinguished from
   other ministers. And thus Paul, in order to shew that he does not
   belong to the ordinary rank of ministers, contends that his calling
   proceeded immediately from God. [13]

   But how does Paul affirm that he was not called by men, while Luke
   records that Paul and Barnabas were called by the church at Antioch?
   Some have replied, that he had previously discharged the duties of an
   apostle, and that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded on his
   appointment by that church. But here, again, it may be objected, that
   this was his first designation to be the apostle of the Gentiles, to
   which class the Galatians belonged. The more correct, and obvious reply
   is, that he did not intend here to set aside entirely the calling of
   that church, but merely to shew that his apostleship rests on a higher
   title. This is true; for even those who laid their hands on Paul at
   Antioch did so, not of their own accord, but in obedience to express
   revelation.

   "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
   Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
   them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
   them, they sent them away." (Acts 13:2,3.)

   Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation, and was also
   appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the
   Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward by men, although
   the customary rite of ordination was afterwards added. [14]

   It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect contrast between Paul and
   the false apostles is here intended. I have no objection to that view;
   for they were in the habit of glorying in the name of men. His meaning
   will therefore stand thus: "Whoever may be the persons by whom others
   boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to them; for I hold
   my commission from God and Christ."

   By Jesus Christ and God the Father He asserts that God the Father and
   Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is first named,
   because it is his prerogative to send, and because we are his
   ambassadors. But to make the statement more complete, the Father is
   also mentioned; as if he had said, "If there be any one whom the name
   of Christ is not sufficient to inspire with reverence, let him know
   that I have also received my office from God the Father."

   Who raised him from the dead. The resurrection of Christ is the
   commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected with the
   present subject. It was a reproach brought by them against Paul that he
   had held no communication with Christ, while he was on the earth. He
   argues, on the other hand, that, as Christ was glorified by his
   resurrection, so he has actually exercised his authority in the
   government of his church. The calling of Paul is therefore more
   illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal,
   had ordained him to the office. And this circumstance deserves
   attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt to set aside his
   authority, involved a malignant opposition to the astonishing power of
   God, which was displayed in the resurrection of Christ; because the
   same heavenly Father, who raised Christ from the dead, commanded Paul
   to make known that exertion of his power.

   2. And all the brethren who are with me. -- He appears to have usually
   written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those to whom he
   wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual, they might
   listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole congregation.
   His general practice is, to insert the salutations from brethren at the
   conclusion, instead of introducing them at the commencement as joint
   authors of the epistle: at least, he never mentions more than two
   names, and those very well known. But here he includes all the
   brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good reason, an opposite
   method. The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some
   degree of influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and
   preparing them to receive instruction.

   To the churches of Galatia. It was an extensive country, and therefore
   contained many churches scattered through it. But is it not wonderful
   that the term "Church", which always implies unity of faith, should
   have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost entirely revolted
   from Christ? I reply, so long as they professed Christianity,
   worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and enjoyed some kind of
   Gospel ministry, they retained the external marks of a church. We do
   not always find in churches such a measure of purity as might be
   desired. The purest have their blemishes; and some are marked, not by a
   few spots, but by general deformity. Though the doctrines and practices
   of any society may not, in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not
   instantly pronounce its defects to be a sufficient reason for
   withholding from it the appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a
   gentleness of disposition utterly at variance with such a course. Yet
   our acknowledgment of societies to be churches of Christ must be
   accompanied by an explicit condemnation of everything in them that is
   improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that, wherever there is
   some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be desired in a
   church is perfect.

   I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing on the single
   word Church, think that whatever they choose to force upon us is
   sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome are
   widely different from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were alive at
   the present day, he would perceive the miserable and dreadfully
   shattered remains of a church; but he would perceive no building. In
   short, the word Church is often applied by a figure of speech in which
   a part is taken for the whole, to any portion of the church, even
   though it may not fully answer to the name.

   3. Grace be to you and peace. This form of salutation, which occurred
   in the other epistles, has received an explanation, to which I still
   adhere. Paul wishes for the Galatians a state of friendship with God,
   and, along with it, all good things; for the favor of God is the source
   from which we derive every kind of prosperity. He presents both
   petitions to Christ, as well as to the Father; because without Christ
   neither grace, nor any real prosperity, can be obtained.

   4. Who gave himself for our sins. He begins with commending the grace
   of Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention of the
   Galatians; for, if they had justly appreciated this benefit of
   redemption, they would never have fallen into opposite views of
   religion. He who knows Christ in a proper manner beholds him earnestly,
   embraces him with the warmest affection, is absorbed in the
   contemplation of him, and desires no other object. The best remedy for
   purifying our minds from any kind of errors or superstitions, is to
   keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and the benefits which he
   has conferred upon us.

   These words, who gave himself for our sins, were intended to convey to
   the Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other
   satisfactions can lawfully be brought into comparison with that
   sacrifice of himself which Christ offered to the Father; that in
   Christ, therefore, and in him alone, atonement for sin, and perfect
   righteousness, must be sought; and that the manner in which we are
   redeemed by him ought to excite our highest admiration. What Paul here
   ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other parts of
   Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one hand, the Father, by an
   eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave this proof of his
   love to us, that he "spared not his only-begotten Son, (Romans 8:32,)
   but delivered him up for us all;" and Christ, on the other hand,
   offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God. Hence it
   follows, that his death is the satisfaction for sins. [15]

   That he might deliver us. He likewise declares the design of our
   redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase us to be
   his own property. This takes place when we are separated from the
   world; for so long as we are of the world, we do not belong to Christ.
   The word aion, (age,) is here put for the corruption which is in the
   world; in the same manner as in the first Epistle of John, (1 John
   5:19) where it is said that "the whole world lieth in the wicked one,"
   and in his Gospel, (John 17:15,) where the Savior says,

   "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world,
   but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;"

   for there it signifies the present life.

   What then is meant by the word "World" in this passage? Men separated
   from the kingdom of God and the grace of Christ. So long as a man lives
   to himself, he is altogether condemned. The World is, therefore,
   contrasted with regeneration, as nature with grace, or the flesh with
   the spirit. Those who are born of the world have nothing but sin and
   wickedness, not by creation, but by corruption. [16] Christ, therefore,
   died for our sins, in order to redeem or separate us from the world.

   From the present wicked age. By adding the epithet "wicked", he
   intended to shew that he is speaking of the corruption or depravity
   which proceeds from sin, and not of God's creatures, or of the bodily
   life. And yet by this single word, as by a thunderbolt, he lays low all
   human pride; for he declares, that, apart from that renewal of the
   nature which is bestowed by the grace of Christ, there is nothing in us
   but unmixed wickedness. We are of the world; and, till Christ take us
   out of it, the world reigns in us, and we live to the world. Whatever
   delight men may take in their fancied excellence, they are worthless
   and depraved; not indeed in their own opinion, but in the judgment of
   our Lord, which is here pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which
   ought to satisfy our minds.

   According to the will. He points out the original fountain of grace,
   namely, the purpose of God;

   "for God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son." (John
   3:16.)

   But it deserves notice, that Paul is accustomed to represent the decree
   of God as setting aside all compensation or merit on the part of men,
   and so Will denotes here what is commonly called "good pleasure." [17]
   The meaning is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were
   worthy, or because anything done by us moved him to the act, but
   because such was the purpose of God. Of God and our Father is of the
   same import as if he had said, "Of God who is our Father." [18]

   5. To whom be glory. By this sudden exclamation of thanksgiving, he
   intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the contemplation of that
   invaluable gift which they had received from God, and in this manner to
   prepare their minds more fully for receiving instruction. It must at
   the same time be viewed as a general exhortation. Every instance in
   which the mercy of God occurs to our remembrance, ought to be embraced
   by us as an occasion of ascribing glory to God.

   Galatians 1:6-9

   6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
   the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

   6. Miror quod ita cito transferimini a Christo, qui vos vocavit in
   gratia, ad aliud evangehum;

   7. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would
   pervert the gospel of Christ.

   7. Quod non est aliud, nisi quod sunt quidant, qui vos turbant, ae
   volunt evertere evangelium Christi.

   8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
   you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

   8. Verum etiamsi nos, aut Angelus e coelo evangelizet vobis praeter id
   quod evangelizavimus vobis, anathema sit.

   9. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other
   gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

   9. Quemadmodum praediximus, nunc quoque iterum dico; si quis vobis
   evangelizaverit praeterquam quod accepistis, anathema sit.


   6. I wonder. He commences by administering a rebuke, though a somewhat
   milder one than they deserved; but his greatest severity of language is
   directed, as we shall see, against the false apostles. He charges them
   with turning aside, not only from his gospel, but from Christ; for it
   was impossible for them to retain their attachment to Christ, without
   acknowledging that he has graciously delivered us from the bondage of
   the law. But such a belief cannot be reconciled with those notions
   respecting the obligation of ceremonial observance which the false
   apostles inculcated. They were removed from Christ; not that they
   entirely rejected Christianity, but that the corruption of their
   doctrines was such as to leave them nothing more than an imaginary
   Christ.

   Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing to have a divided and
   mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore "removed from Christ."
   They are full of superstitions, which are directly at variance with the
   nature of Christ. Let it be carefully observed, that we are removed
   from Christ, when we fall into those views which are inconsistent with
   his mediatorial office; for light can have no fellowship with darkness.

   On the same principle, he calls it another gospel, that is, a gospel
   different from the true one. And yet the false apostles professed that
   they preached the gospel of Christ; but, mingling with it their own
   inventions, [19] by which its principal efficacy was destroyed, they
   held a false, corrupt, and spurious gospel. By using the present tense,
   ("ye are removed") he appears to say that they were only in the act of
   failing. As if he had said, "I do not yet say that ye have been
   removed; for then it would be more difficult to return to the right
   path. But now, at the critical moment, do not advance a single step,
   but instantly retreat."

   From Christ, who called you by grace. Others read it, "from him who
   called you by the grace of Christ," understanding it to refer to the
   Father; but the reading which we have followed is more simple. When he
   says that they were called by Christ through grace, this tends to
   heighten the criminality of their ingratitude. To revolt from the Son
   of God under any circumstances, is unworthy and disgraceful; but to
   revolt from him, after being invited to partake salvation by grace, is
   more eminently base. His goodness to us renders our ingratitude to him
   more dreadfully heinous.

   So soon. When it is considered how soon they had discovered a want of
   steadfastness, their guilt is still further heightened. A proper
   season, indeed, for departing from Christ cannot be imagined. But the
   fact, that no sooner had Paul left them than the Galatians were led
   away from the truth, inferred still deeper blame. As the consideration
   of the grace by which they had been called was adduced to aggravate
   their ingratitude, so the circumstance of the time when they were
   removed is now adduced to aggravate their levity.

   7. Which is not another thing [20] Some explain it thus, "though there
   is not another gospel;" as if it were a sort of correction of the
   Apostle's language, to guard against the supposition that there were
   more gospels than one. So far as the explanation of the words is
   concerned, I take a more simple view of them; for he speaks
   contemptuously of the doctrine of the false apostles, as being nothing
   else than a mass of confusion and destruction. As if he had said, "What
   do those persons allege? On what grounds do they attack the doctrine
   which I have delivered? They merely trouble you, and subvert the
   gospel. They do nothing more." But it amounts to the same meaning; for
   this, too, I acknowledge, is a correction of the language he had used
   about another gospel. He declares that it is not a gospel, but a mere
   disturbance. All I intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word
   another means another thing. It resembles strongly the expression in
   common use, "this amounts to nothing, but that you wish to deceive."

   And wish to pervert. He charges them with the additional crime of doing
   an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his gospel. Subversion
   is an enormous crime. It is worse than corruption. And with good reason
   does he fasten on them this charge. When the glow of justification is
   ascribed to another, and a snare is laid for the consciences of men,
   the Savior no longer occupies his place, and the doctrine of the gospel
   is utterly ruined.

   The gospel of Christ. To know what are the leading points of the
   gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are attacked,
   the gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words, of Christ, this may be
   explained in two ways; either that it has come from Christ as its
   author, or that it purely exhibits Christ. The apostle's reason for
   employing that expression unquestionably was to describe the true and
   genuine gospel, which alone is worthy of the name.

   8. But though we. As he proceeds in defending the authority of his
   doctrine, his confidence swells. First of all, he declares that the
   doctrine which he had preached is the only gospel, and that the attempt
   to set it aside is highly criminal. But then he was aware, the false
   apostles might object: "We will not yield to you in our desire to
   maintain the gospel, or in those feelings of respect for it which we
   are accustomed to cherish." Just as, at the present day, the Papists
   describe in the strongest terms the sacredness with which they regard
   the gospel, and kiss the very name with the deepest reverence, and yet,
   when brought to the trial, are found to persecute fiercely the pure and
   simple doctrine of the gospel. Accordingly, Paul does not rest
   satisfied with this general declaration, but proceeds to define what
   the gospel is, and what it contains, and declares boldly that his
   doctrine is the true gospel; so as to resist all further inquiry.

   Of what avail was it to profess respect for the gospel, and not to know
   what it meant? With Papists, who hold themselves bound to render
   implicit faith, that might be perfectly sufficient; but with
   Christians, where there is no knowledge, there is no faith. That the
   Galatians, who were otherwise disposed to obey the gospel, might not
   wander hither and thither, and "find no rest for the sole of their
   foot," (Genesis 8:9,) Paul enjoins them to stand steadfastly by his
   doctrine. He demands such unhesitating belief of his preaching, that he
   pronounces a curse on all who dared to contradict it.

   And here it is not a little remarkable, that he begins with himself;
   for thus he anticipates a slander with which his enemies would have
   loaded him. "You wish to have everything which comes from you received
   without hesitation, because it is your own." To show that there is no
   foundation for such a statement, he instantly surrenders the right of
   advancing anything against his own doctrine. He claims no superiority,
   in this respect, over other men, but justly demands from all, equally
   with himself, subjection to the word of God.

   Or an angel from heaven. In order to destroy more completely the
   pretensions of the false apostles, he rises so high as to speak of
   angels; and, on the supposition that they taught a different doctrine,
   he does not satisfy himself with saying that they were not entitled to
   be heard, but declares that they ought to be held accursed. Some may
   think, that it was absurd to engage in a controversy with angels about
   his doctrine; but a just view of the whole matter will enable any one
   to perceive, that this part of the apostle's proceedings was proper and
   necessary. It is impossible, no doubt, for angels from heaven to teach
   anything else than the certain truth of God. But when the credit due to
   doctrines which God had revealed concerning the salvation of men was
   the subject of controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the
   judgment of men, without declining, at the same time, the authority of
   angels.

   And thus, when he pronounces a curse on angels who should teach any
   other doctrine [21] though his argument is derived from an
   impossibility, it is not superfluous. This exaggerated language must,
   have contributed greatly to strengthen the confidence in Paul's
   preaching. His opponents, by employing the lofty titles of men,
   attempted to press hard on him and on his doctrine. He meets them by
   the bold assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his authority.
   This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the glory of God by
   every possible means was the design of their creation. He who
   endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish this object, by an
   apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts nothing from
   their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an impressive
   manner, the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also, a powerful
   confirmation to our faith while, in reliance on that word, we feel
   ourselves at liberty to treat even angels with defiance and scorn. When
   he says, "let him be accursed," the meaning must be, "let him be held
   by you as accursed." In expounding 1 Corinthians 12:3, we had occasion
   to speak of the word anathema. [22] . Here it denotes cursing, and
   answers to the Hebrew word, hrm (hherem.)

   9. As we said before. Leaving out, in this instance, the mention of
   himself and of angels, he repeats the former assertion, that it is
   unlawful for any man to teach anything contrary to what they had
   learned. [23] Observe the expression -- ye have received; for he
   uniformly insists, that they must not regard the gospel as something
   unknown, existing in the air, or in their own imaginations. He exhorts
   them to entertain a firm and serious conviction, that the doctrine
   which they had received and embraced is the true gospel of Christ.
   Nothing can be more inconsistent with the nature of faith than a
   feeble, wavering assent. What, then, must be the consequence, if
   ignorance of the nature and character of the gospel shall lead to
   hesitation? Accordingly he enjoins them to regard as devils those who
   shall dare to bring forward a gospel different from his, -- meaning by
   another gospel, one to which the inventions of other men are added;
   [24] for the doctrine of the false apostles was not entirely contrary,
   or even different, from that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions.

   To what poor subterfuges do the Papists resort, in order to escape from
   the Apostle's declaration! First, they tell us, that we have not in our
   possession the whole of Paul's preaching, and cannot know what it
   contained, unless the Galatians who heard it shall be raised from the
   dead, in order to appear as witnesses. Next, they assert, that it is
   not every kind of addition which is forbidden, but that other gospels
   only are condemned. What Paul's doctrine was, so far as it concerns us
   to know, may be learned with sufficient clearness from his writings. Of
   this gospel, it is plain, the whole of Popery is a dreadful perversion.
   And from the nature of the case, we remark in conclusion, it is
   manifest that any spurious doctrine whatever is at variance with Paul's
   preaching; so that these cavils will avail them nothing.

   Galatians 1:10-14

   10. For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for
   if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

   10. Nunc enim suadeone secundum homines, an secundum Deum? vel quaero
   hominibus placere? si enim adhuc hominibus placerem, Christi servus non
   essem.

   11. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of
   me is not after man.

   11. Notum autem vobis faeio, fratres, Deuteronomy Evangelio, quod
   evangelizatum est a me, quod non est secundum hominem;

   12. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
   the revelation of Jesus Christ.

   12. Neque enim ego ab hormine accepi illud, neque didici; sed per
   revelationem Iesu Christi.

   13. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
   religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
   wasted it;

   13. Audistis enim conversationem meam, quae aliquando fuit in Iudaismo;
   quod supra modum persequebar ecclesiam Dei, et vastabam illam,

   14. And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own
   nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

   14. Et proficiebam in Iudaismo supra multos aequales meos in gernere
   meo, quum vehementius studiosus essem paternarum traditionum.


   Having extolled so confidently his own preaching, he now shows that
   this was no idle or empty boast. He supports his assertion by two
   arguments. The first is, that he was not prompted by ambition, or
   flattery, or any similar passion, to accommodate himself to the views
   of men. The second and far stronger argument is, that he was not the
   author of the gospel, but delivered faithfully what he had received
   from God.

   10. For do I now persuade according to men or according to God? The
   ambiguity of the Greek construction in this passage, has given rise to
   a variety of expositions. Some render it, Do I now persuade men or God?
   [25] Others interpret the words "God" and "men," as meaning divine and
   human concerns. This sense would agree very well with the context, if
   it were not too wide a departure from the words. The view which I have
   preferred is more natural; for nothing is more common with the Greeks
   than to leave the preposition kata, according to, to be understood.

   Paul is speaking, not about the subject of his preaching, but about the
   purpose of his own mind, which could not refer so properly to men as to
   God. The disposition of the speaker, it must be owned, may have some
   influence on his doctrine. As corruption of doctrine springs from
   ambition, avarice, or any other sinful passion, so the truth is
   maintained in its purity by an upright conscience. And so he contends
   that his doctrine is sound, because it is not modified so as to gratify
   men.

   Or, do I seek to please men? This second clause differs not much, and
   yet it differs somewhat from the former; for the desire of obtaining
   favor is one motive for speaking "according to men." When there reigns
   in our hearts such ambition, that we desire to regulate our discourse
   so as to obtain the favor of men, our instructions cannot be sincere.
   Paul therefore declares, that he is in no degree chargeable with this
   vice; and, the more boldly to repel the calumnious insinuation, he
   employs the interrogative form of speech; for interrogations carry the
   greater weight, when our opponents are allowed an opportunity of
   replying, if they have anything to say. This expresses the great
   boldness which Paul derived from the testimony of a good conscience;
   for he knew that he had discharged his duty in such a manner as not to
   be liable to any reproach of that kind. (Acts 23:1; 2 Corinthians
   1:12.)

   If I yet pleased men This is a remarkable sentiment; that ambitious
   persons, that is, those who hunt after the applause of men, cannot
   serve Christ. He declares for himself, that he had freely renounced the
   estimation of men, in order to devote himself entirely to the service
   of Christ; and, in this respect, he contrasts his present position with
   that which he occupied at a former period of life. He had been regarded
   with the highest esteem, had received from every quarter loud applause;
   and, therefore, if he had chosen to please men, he would not have found
   it necessary to change his condition. But we may draw from it the
   general doctrine which I have stated, that those who resolve to serve
   Christ faithfully, must have boldness to despise the favor of men.

   The word men is here employed in a limited sense; for the ministers of
   Christ ought not to labor for the express purpose of displeasing men.
   But there are various classes of men. Those to whom Christ "is
   precious," (1 Peter 2:7,) are men whom we should endeavor to please in
   Christ; while they who choose that the true doctrine shall give place
   to their own passions, are men to whom we must give no countenance. And
   godly, upright pastors, will always find it necessary to contend with
   the offenses of those who choose that, on all points, their own wishes
   shall be gratified; for the Church will always contain hypocrites and
   wicked men, by whom their own lusts will be preferred to the word of
   God. And even good men, either through ignorance, or through weak
   prejudice, are sometimes tempted by the devil to be displeased with the
   faithful warnings of their pastor. Our duty, therefore, is not to take
   alarm at any kind of offenses, provided, at the same time, that we do
   not excite in weak minds a prejudice against Christ himself.

   Many interpret this passage in a different manner, as implying an
   admission to the following effect: "If I pleased men, then I should not
   be the servant of Christ. I own it, but who shall bring such a charge
   against me? Who does not see that I do not court the favor of men?" But
   I prefer the former view, that Paul is relating how large an amount of
   the estimation of men he had relinquished, in order to devote himself
   to the service of Christ.

   11. Now I make known to you. This is the most powerful argument, the
   main hinge on which the question turns, that he has not received the
   gospel from men, but that it has been revealed to him by God. As this
   might be denied, he offers a proof, drawn from a narrative of facts. To
   give his declaration the greater weight, he sets out with stating that
   the matter is not doubtful, [26] but one which he is prepared to prove;
   and thus introduces himself in a manner well adapted to a serious
   subject. He affirms that it is not according to man; that it savours of
   nothing human, or, that it was not of human contrivance; and in proof
   of this he afterwards adds, that he had not been instructed by any
   earthly teacher. [27]

   12. For I neither received it from man. What then? shall the authority
   of the word be diminished, because one who has been instructed by the
   instrumentality of men shall afterwards become a teacher? We must take
   into account, all along, the weapons with which the false apostles
   attacked him, alleging that his gospel was defective and spurious; that
   he had obtained it from an inferior and incompetent teacher; and that
   his imperfect education led him to make unguarded statements. They
   boasted, on the other hand, that they had been instructed by the
   highest apostles, with whose views they were most intimately
   acquainted. It was therefore necessary that Paul should state his
   doctrine in opposition to the whole world, and should rest it on this
   ground, that he had acquired it not in the school of any man, but by
   revelation from God. In no other way could he have set aside the
   reproaches of the false apostles.

   The objection, that Ananias (Acts 9:10) was his teacher, may be easily
   answered. His divine instruction, communicated to him by immediate
   inspiration, did not render it improper that a man should be employed
   in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his public ministry. In
   like manner, we have already shown, that he had a direct call from God
   by revelation, and that he was ordained by the votes and the solemn
   approbation of men. These statements are not inconsistent with each
   other.

   13. For ye have heard of my conversation. The whole of this narrative
   was added as a part of his argument. He relates that, during his whole
   life, he had such an abhorrence of the gospel, that he was a mortal
   enemy of it, and a destroyer of the name of Christianity. Hence we
   infer that his conversion was divine. And indeed he calls them as
   witnesses of a matter not at all doubtful, so as to place beyond
   controversy what he is about to say.

   His equals were those of his own age; for a comparison with older
   persons would have been unsuitable. When he speaks of the traditions of
   the fathers, he means, not those additions by which the law of God had
   been corrupted, but the law of God itself, in which he had been
   educated from his childhood, and which he had received through the
   hands of his parents and ancestors. Having been strongly attached to
   the customs of his fathers, it would have been no easy matter to tear
   him from them, had not the Lord drawn him by a miracle.

   Galatians 1:15-24

   15. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb,
   and called me by his grace,

   15. At postquam placuit Deo, qui me segregaverat ab utero matris meae,
   et vocavit per gratiam suam,

   16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen;
   immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

   16. Revelare Filium suum mihi, ut praedicarem ipsnm inter Gentes,
   continuo non contuli cum carne et sanguine;

   17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before
   me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.

   17. Neque redii Hierosolymam, ad eos qui ante me fuerunt Apestoli; sed
   abii in Arabiam, ac denuo reversus sum Damascum.

   18. Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
   abode with him fifteen days.

   18. Deinde post annos tres redii Hierosolymam, ut viderein Petrum; et
   mansi apud illum dies quindecim.

   19. But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
   brother.

   19. Alium antem ex Apostolis non vidi quenquam, nisi Iacobum fratrem
   Domini.

   20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
   not.

   20. Porro quae scribo vobis, ecce coram Deo, non mentier.

   21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

   21. Deinde vent in regiones Syriae ac Ciliciae.

   22. And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in
   Christ:

   22. Eram autem facie ignotus Ecclesiis Iudaeae, qute erant in Christo.

   23. But they had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past,
   now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

   23. Sed tantum hic rumor apud illos erat; Qui persequebatur nos
   aliquando, nunc praedicat fidem quam quondam expugnabat.

   24. And they glorified God in me.

   24. Et glorificabant in me Deum.


   15. But after that it pleased God. This is the second part of the
   narrative, and relates to his miraculous conversion. He tells us,
   first, that he had been called by the grace of God to preach Christ
   among the Gentiles; and, next, that as soon as he had been called,
   without consulting the apostles, he unhesitatingly proceeded to the
   performance of the work, which, he felt assured, had been enjoined upon
   him by the appointment of God. In the construction of the words,
   Erasmus differs from the Vulgate. He connects them in the following
   manner: "When it pleased God that I should preach Christ among the
   Gentiles, who called me for this purpose that he might reveal him by
   me." But I prefer the old translation; for Christ had been revealed to
   Paul before he received a command to preach. Admitting that Erasmus
   were right in translating en emoi, by me, still the clause, that I
   might preach, is added for the purpose of describing the kind of
   revelation.

   Paul's reasoning does not, at first sight, appear so strong; for
   although, when he had been converted to Christianity, he instantly, and
   without consulting the apostles, entered into the office of preaching
   the gospel, it does not thence follow that he had been appointed to
   that office by the revelation of Christ. But the arguments which he
   employs are various, and, when they are all collected, will be found
   sufficiently strong to establish his conclusion. He argues, first, that
   he had been called by the grace of God; next, that his apostleship had
   been acknowledged by the other apostles; and the other arguments
   follow. Let the reader, therefore, remember to read the whole narrative
   together, and to draw the inference, not from single parts, but from
   the whole.

   Who had separated me. This separation was the purpose of God, by which
   Paul was appointed to the apostolic office, before he knew that he was
   born. The calling followed afterwards at the proper time, when the Lord
   made known his will concerning him, and commanded him to proceed to the
   work. God had, no doubt, decreed, before the foundation of the world,
   what he would do with regard to every one of us, and had assigned to
   every one, by his secret counsel, his respective place. But the sacred
   writers frequently introduce those three steps: the eternal
   predestination of God, the destination from the womb, and the calling,
   which is the effect and accomplishment of both.

   The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah, though expressed a little
   differently from this passage, has entirely the same meaning.

   "Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest
   forth from the womb I sanctified thee; a prophet to the nations have I
   made thee." (Jeremiah 1:5.)

   Before they even existed, Jeremiah had been set apart to the office of
   a prophet, and Paul to that of an apostle; but he is said to separate
   us from the womb, because the design of our being sent into the world
   is, that he may accomplish, in us, what he has decreed. The calling is
   delayed till its proper time, when God has prepared us for the office
   which he commands us to undertake.

   Paul's words may therefore be read thus: "When it pleased God to reveal
   his Son, by me, who called me, as he had formerly separated me." He
   intended to assert, that his calling depends on the secret election of
   God; and that he was ordained an apostle, not because by his own
   industry he had fitted himself for undertaking so high an office, or
   because God had accounted him worthy of having it bestowed upon him,
   but because, before he was born, he had been set apart by the secret
   purpose of God.

   Thus, in his usual manner, he traces his calling to the good pleasure
   of God. This deserves our careful attention; for it shows us that we
   owe it to the goodness of God, not only that we have been elected and
   adopted to everlasting life, but that he deigns to make use of our
   services, who would otherwise have been altogether useless, and that he
   assigns to us a lawful calling, in which we may be employed. What had
   Paul, before he was born, to entitle him to so high an honor? In like
   manner we ought to believe, that it is entirely the gift of God, and
   not obtained by our own industry, that we have been called to govern
   the Church.

   The subtle distinctions into which some commentators have entered in
   explaining the word separated, are altogether foreign to the subject.
   God is said to separate us, not because he bestows any peculiar
   disposition of mind which distinguishes us from others, but because he
   appoints us by his own purpose [28] . Although the apostle had most
   explicitly attributed his calling to the free grace of God, when he
   pronounced that voluntary separation from the womb to be the origin of
   it, yet he repeats the direct statement, both that, by his commendation
   of Divine grace, he may take away all grounds of boasting, and that he
   may testify his own gratitude to God. On this subject he is wont freely
   to expatiate, even when he has no controversy with the false apostles.

   16. To reveal his Son to me. If we read it, "to reveal by me," it will
   express the design of the apostleship, which is to make Christ known.
   And how was this to be accomplished? By preaching him among the
   Gentiles, which the false apostles treated as a crime. But I consider
   the Greek phrase en emoi [29] to be a Hebrew idiom for to me; for the
   Hebrew particle v (beth) is frequently redundant, as all who know that
   language are well aware. The meaning will therefore be, that Christ was
   revealed to Paul, not that he might alone enjoy, and silently retain in
   his own bosom the knowledge of Christ, but that he might preach among
   the Gentiles the Savior whom he had known.

   Immediately I conferred not. To confer with flesh and blood, is to
   consult with flesh and blood. So far as the meaning of these words is
   concerned, his intention was absolutely to have nothing to do with any
   human counsels. The general expression, as will presently appear from
   the context, includes all men, and all the prudence or wisdom which
   they may possess. [30] He even makes a direct reference to the
   apostles, for the express purpose of exhibiting, in a stronger light,
   the immediate calling of God. Relying on the authority of God alone,
   and asking nothing more, he proceeded to discharge the duty of
   preaching the gospel.

   17. Neither did I return to Jerusalem. What he had just written is now
   explained, and more fully stated. As if he had said, "I did not ask the
   authority of any man," not even of the apostles themselves. It is a
   mistake to suppose, that, because the apostles are now separately
   mentioned, they are not included in the words, flesh and blood. Nothing
   new or different is here added, but merely a clearer explanation of
   what had been already said. And no disrespect to the apostles is
   implied in that expression. For the purpose of shewing that he did not
   owe his commission to man, the false boasting of unprincipled men laid
   him under the necessity of contrasting. the authority of the apostles
   themselves with the authority of God. When a creature is brought into
   comparison with God, however contemptuous or humiliating may be the
   language employed, he has no reason to complain.

   But I went into Arabia. In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke has omitted
   these three years. In like manner, there are other passages of the
   history which he does not touch; and hence the slander of those who
   seek to build on this a charge of inconsistency in the narratives is
   ridiculous. Let godly readers consider the severe temptation with which
   Paul was called to struggle at the very commencement of his course. He
   who but yesterday, for the sake of doing him honor, had been sent to
   Damascus with a magnificent retinue, is now compelled to wander as an
   exile in a foreign land: but he does not lose his courage.

   18. Then after three years. It was not till three years after he had
   begun to discharge the apostolic office, that he went up to Jerusalem.
   Thus, he did not, at the outset, receive the calling of men. But lest
   it should be supposed that he had separate interests from theirs, and
   was desirous to avoid their society, he tells us that he went up for
   the express purpose to see [31] Peter. [32] Although he had not waited
   for their sanction before undertaking the office, yet it was not
   against their will, but with their full consent and approbation, that
   he held the rank of an apostle. He is desirous to shew that at no
   period was he at variance with the apostles, and that even now he is in
   full harmony with all their views. By mentioning the short time that he
   remained there, he shews that he had come, not with a view to learn,
   but solely for mutual intercourse.

   19. But I saw no other of the apostles. This is added to make it
   evident that he had but one object in his journey, and attended to
   nothing else.

   Except James. Who this James was, deserves inquiry. Almost all the
   ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was
   "Oblias" and "The Just," and that he presided over the church at
   Jerusalem. [33] Yet others think that he was the son of Joseph by
   another wife, and others (which is more probable) that he was the
   cousin of Christ by the mother's side: [34] but as he is here mentioned
   among the apostles, I do not hold that opinion. Nor is there any force
   in the defense offered by Jerome, that the word Apostle is sometimes
   applied to others besides the twelve; for the subject under
   consideration is the highest rank of apostleship, and we shall
   presently see that he was considered one of the chief pillars.
   (Galatians 2:9.) It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that
   the person of whom he is speaking is the son of Alpheus. [35]

   The rest of the apostles, there is reason to believe, were scattered
   through various countries; for they did not idly remain in one place.
   Luke relates that Paul was brought by Barnabas to the apostles. (Acts
   9:27.) This must be understood to relate, not to the twelve, but to
   these two apostles, who alone were at that time residing in Jerusalem.

   20. Now the things which I write to you. This affirmation extends to
   the whole narrative. The vast earnestness of Paul on this subject is
   evinced by his resorting to an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed
   but on great and weighty occasions. Nor is it wonderful that he insists
   with so much earnestness on this point; for we have already seen to
   what expedients the impostors had recourse in order to take from him
   the name and credit of an apostle. Now the modes of swearing used by
   good men deserve our attention; for we learn from them that an oath
   must be viewed simply as an appeal to the judgment-seat of God for the
   integrity and truth of our words and actions; and such a transaction
   ought to be guided by religion and the fear of God.

   22. And was unknown by face. This appears to be added for the sake of
   shewing more strongly the wickedness and malignity of his slanderers.
   If the churches of Judea who had only heard respecting him, were led to
   give glory to God for the astonishing change which he had wrought in
   Paul, how disgraceful was it that those who had beheld the fruits of
   his amazing labors should not have acted a similar part! If the mere
   report was enough for the former, why did not the facts before their
   eyes satisfy the latter?

   23. Which once he destroyed. This does not mean that faith [36] may
   actually be destroyed, but that he lessened its influence on the minds
   of weak men. Besides, it is the will, rather than the deed, that is
   here expressed.

   24. And they glorified God in me [37] This was an evident proof that
   his ministry was approved by all the churches of Judea, and approved in
   such a manner, that they broke out into admiration and praise of the
   wonderful power of God. Thus he indirectly reproves their malice, by
   showing that their venom and slanders could have no other effect than
   to hide the glory of God, which, as the apostles admitted and openly
   acknowledged, shone brightly in the apostleship of Paul.

   This reminds us of the light in which the saints of the Lord ought to
   be regarded by us. When we behold men adorned with the gifts of God,
   such is our depravity, or ingratitude, or proneness to superstition,
   that we worship them as gods, unmindful of Him by whom those gifts were
   bestowed. These words remind us, on the contrary, to lift up our eyes
   to the Great Author, and to ascribe to Him what is his own, while they
   at the same time inform us that an occasion of offering praise to God
   was furnished by the change produced on Paul, from being an enemy to
   becoming a minister of Christ.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Galatians 2:1-5

   1. Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with
   Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

   1. Deinde post annos quatuordecim ascendi rursus Hierosolymam una cum
   Barnaba, assumpto simul et Tito.

   2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel
   which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of
   reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

   2. Ascendi autem secundum revelationera, et contuli cum illis
   evangelium, quod praedico inter Gentes; privatim vero cum iis qui in
   pretio erant, ne quo mode in vahum currerem, aut cucurrssem,

   3. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to
   be circumcised:

   3. Sed neque Titus, qui mecum erat, quum esset Graecus, compulsus fuit
   circumcidi;

   4. And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in
   privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they
   might bring us into bondage:

   4. Propter subingresses falsos fratres, qui subintroierant ad
   explorandum libertatem nostram, quam habemus in Christo Iesu; quo nos
   in servitutem adigerent;

   5. To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour, that the
   truth of the gospel might continue with you.

   5. Quibus ne ad heram quidem cessimus per subjectionem, ut veri tas
   evangelii maneret apud vos.


   1. Fourteen years after. This cannot with certainty be affirmed to be
   the same journey mentioned by Luke. (Acts 15:2.) The connection of the
   history leads us rather to an opposite conclusion. We find that Paul
   performed four journeys to Jerusalem. Of the first we have already
   spoken. The second took place when, in company with Barnabas, he
   brought the charitable contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches.
   (Acts 15:25.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the
   present passage rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the
   statements of Paul and Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is
   ground for conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at
   Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now, this happened before he was
   sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the dispute which had
   arisen about ceremonial observances. (Acts 15:2.) It is not reasonable
   to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation, if that
   controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles published.
   But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards adds that he
   had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act which Peter
   certainly would not have committed except in matters that were
   doubtful. [38]

   Besides, he would scarcely have alluded, at any time, to that journey
   [39] undertaken with the consent of all the believers, without
   mentioning the occasion of it, and the memorable decision which was
   passed. It is not even certain at what time the Epistle was written,
   only that the Greeks conjecture that it was sent from Rome, and the
   Latins from Ephesus. For my own part, I think that it was written, not
   only before Paul had seen Rome, but before that consultation had been
   held, and the decision of the Apostles given about ceremonial
   observances. While his opponents were falsely pleading the name of the
   apostles, and earnestly striving to ruin the reputation of Paul, what
   carelessness would it have angered in him to pass by the decree
   universally circulated among them, which struck at those very persons!
   [40] Undoubtedly, this one word would have shut their mouth: "You bring
   against me the authority of the apostles, but who does not know their
   decision? and therefore I hold you convicted of unblushing falsehood.
   In their name, you oblige the Gentiles to keep the law, but I appeal to
   their own writing, which sets the consciences of men at liberty."

   We may likewise observe, that, in the commencement of the Epistle, he
   reproved the Galatians for having so soon revolted from the gospel
   which had been delivered to them. But we may readily conclude, that,
   after they had been brought to believe the gospel, some time must have
   elapsed before that dispute about the ceremonial law arose. I consider,
   therefore, that the fourteen years are to be reckoned, not from one
   journey to another, but from Paul's conversion. The space of time
   between the two journeys was eleven years.

   2. And I went up according to revelation. [41] He now proceeds to prove
   his apostleship and his doctrine, not only by works, but also by a
   Divine revelation. Since God directed that journey, which had for its
   object the confirmation of his doctrine, the doctrine was confirmed,
   not by the concurrence of men only, but likewise by the authority of
   God. This ought to have been more than enough to overcome the obstinacy
   of those who blamed Paul by holding up the names of the apostles. For
   although, up to this time, there had been some room for debate, the
   communication of the mind of God put an end to all discussion.

   I communicated to them. The word communicated claims our first
   attention; for the apostles do not describe to him what he ought to
   teach, but, after listening to his own account of his doctrine, express
   their concurrence and approbation. But, as his opponents might allege
   that, by cunning dissimulation on many points, he had gained the favor
   of the apostles, he expressly states that he "communicated to them that
   doctrine which he preacheth among the Gentiles;" which removes all
   suspicion of hypocrisy or imposture. We shall see what followed; for
   the apostles did not take it amiss that he had not waited to obtain
   their sanction. On the contrary, without dispute or expostulation, they
   approved of his labors; and did so by the direction of the same Spirit,
   under whose guidance Paul had performed his journey to Jerusalem. Thus,
   he was not made an apostle by them, but acknowledged to be an apostle.
   But this point will be treated more fully afterwards.

   Lest by any means. What then? Shall the word of God fall, when it is
   unsupported by the testimony of men? Though the whole world were
   unbelieving, yet the word of God remains firm and unshaken: and they
   who preach the gospel by the command of God are not uselessly employed,
   even when no fruit is produced by their labors. This is not Paul's
   meaning; but, as the consciences of men, so long as they doubt and
   hesitate, derive no benefit from the ministry of the word, so a
   preacher is said, so far as men is concerned, to run in vain, when his
   labors are ineffectual, and unaccompanied by proper edification.

   It was, therefore, a formidable weapon for shaking weak consciences,
   when the doctrine which Paul preached was falsely declared by impostors
   to be at variance with the doctrine of the apostles. Multitudes in this
   manner fell away. The certainty of faith, indeed, does not depend on
   the agreement of human opinions; but, on the contrary, it is our duty
   to rest in the naked truth of God, so that neither men nor all the
   angels together, could shake our faith. Yet ignorant persons, who have
   imperfectly understood, and never have cordially embraced, sound
   doctrine, feel the temptation to be almost irresistible, while teachers
   of acknowledged eminence are found to entertain opposite views. Nay,
   strong believers are sometimes powerfully affected by this stratagem of
   Satan, when he holds out to their view the "strife and divisions" (1
   Corinthians 3:3) of those who ought to have been

   "perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
   (1 Corinthians 1:10.)

   It is hard to tell how many were driven from the gospel, how many had
   their faith shaken, by the mournful controversy about the bodily
   presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, because, on a question of the
   highest moment, very distinguished men were observed to take opposite
   sides.

   On the other hand, the agreement of all who teach in the Church is a
   powerful aid for the confirmation of faith. Since, therefore, Satan was
   laboring so insidiously to hinder the progress of the gospel, Paul
   resolved to meet him. When he had succeeded in demonstrating that he
   held the same views with all the apostles, every hinderance was
   removed. Weak disciples were no longer perplexed by the inquiry, whom
   they ought to follow. His meaning may be thus summed up: "That my
   former labors might not be thrown away and rendered useless, I have set
   at rest the question which disturbed many minds, whether I or Peter
   deserved your confidence; for in all that I had ever taught we were
   perfectly at one." If many teachers in our own day were as heartily
   desirous as Paul was to edify the Church, they would take more pains to
   be agreed among themselves.

   3. But neither Titus. This is an additional argument to prove that the
   Apostles held the same views with himself; for he had brought to them
   an uncircumcised man, whom they did not hesitate to acknowledge as a
   brother. The reason is assigned why he was not circumcised; for
   circumcision, being a matter of indifference, might be neglected or
   practiced as edification required. Our invariable rule of action is,
   that, if "all things are lawful for us," (1 Corinthians 10:23) we ought
   to inquire what is expedient. He circumcises Timothy, (Acts 16:3,) in
   order to take away a ground of offense from weak minds; for he was at
   that time dealing with weak minds, which it was his duty to treat with
   tenderness. And he would gladly have done the same thing with Titus,
   for he was unwearied in his endeavors to "support (Acts 20:35) the
   weak;" but the case was different. For some false brethren were
   watching for an opportunity of slandering his doctrine, and would
   immediately have spread the report: "See how the valiant champion of
   liberty, when he comes into the presence of the apostles, lays aside
   the bold and fierce aspect which he is wont to assume among the
   ignorant!" Now, as it is our duty to "bear the infirmities of the
   weak," (Romans 15:1,) so concealed foes, who purposely watch for our
   liberty, must, be vigorously resisted. The duties of love to our
   neighbor ought never to be injurious to faith; and therefore, in
   matters of indifference, the love of our neighbour will be our best
   guide, provided that faith shall always receive our first regard.

   4. And that because of false brethren. This may mean either that false
   brethren made it the subject of wicked accusation, and endeavored to
   compel him; or that Paul purposely did not circumcise him, because he
   saw that they would immediately make it an occasion of slander. They
   had insinuated themselves into Paul's company with the hope of gaining
   one of two objects. Either he would treat with open scorn the
   ceremonial law, and then they would rouse the indignation of the Jews
   against him; or he would refrain entirely from the exercise of his
   liberty, and in that case they would exult over him among the Gentiles
   as one who, overwhelmed with shame, had retracted his doctrine.

   I prefer the second interpretation, that Paul, having discovered the
   snares laid for him, determined not to circumcise Titus. When he says
   that he was not "compelled," the reader is led to understand that
   circumcision is not condemned as a bad thing in itself, but that the
   obligation to observe it was the subject of dispute. As if he had said,
   "I would have been prepared to circumcise Titus if higher matters had
   not been involved." Their intention was to lay down a law; and to such
   compulsion he would not yield.

   5. To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour. This
   steadiness was the seal of Paul's doctrine. For when false brethren,
   who wished nothing more than a ground of accusation against him,
   exerted themselves to the utmost, and he stood firm, there could no
   longer be any room for doubt. It cannot now be insinuated that he
   deceived the apostles. He asserts that he did not for a moment give
   place to them by subjection, that is, by such a mode of yielding as
   would have implied that his liberty had been crushed. In every other
   respect, he was prepared, to the very close of his life, to exercise
   mildness and forbearance toward all men.

   That the truth of the gospel. There was no danger that Paul would be
   deprived of his liberty even by yielding to them; but the example would
   have done harm to others, and therefore he prudently inquired what was
   expedient. This shows us how far offenses must be avoided, and points
   us to edification as the object which ought to be kept in view in all
   matters of indifference. The amount, is this: "We are the servants of
   the brethren, but still keeping in view that we all serve the Lord, and
   that the liberty of our conscience shall remain unimpaired." When false
   brethren wished to bring the saints in to bondage, it was their duty
   not to yield to them.

   The truth of the gospel denotes its genuine purity, or, which means the
   same thing, its pure and entire doctrine. For the false apostles did
   not altogether set aside the gospel, but mixed up with it their own
   notions, so as to give it a false and disguised aspect, which it always
   has when we make the smallest departure "from the simplicity that is in
   Christ." (2 Corinthians 11:3.)

   With what effrontery then will the Papists boast that they possess the
   gospel, which is not only corrupted by many inventions, but more than
   adulterated by many wicked doctrines? Let us remember that it is not
   enough to retain the name of the gospel, and some kind of summary of
   its doctrines, if its solid purity do not remain untouched. Where are
   the men who, by pretended moderation, endeavor to bring about a
   reconciliation between us and the Papists? as if the doctrine of
   religion, like a matter affecting money or property, could be
   compromised. With what abhorrence would such a transaction have been
   regarded by Paul, who affirms that it is not the true gospel, if it is
   not pure!

   Galatians 2:6-10

   6. But of those who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
   maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who
   seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:

   6. Ab iis autem qui videbantur aliquid esse, quales aliquando fuerint,
   nihil mea refert (personam hominis Deus non accipit, Deuteronomy 10:
   17; 2 Paral. 19:7; Job 34:19; Wisdom 6:8.; Ecclesiastes 35:15; Acts
   10:34; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25; 1 Peter 1:17) nam
   mihi, qui videbantur esse in pretio nihil contulerunt

   7. But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
   uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision
   was unto Peter;

   7. Imo contra, quum vidissent mihi concreditum fuisse evangelium
   praeprputii, quemadmodum Petro Circumcisionis;

   8. (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the
   circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)

   8. (Nam qui efficax fuit in Petro ad apostolatum Circumcisionis efficax
   fuit et in me erga Gentes);

   9. And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
   perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and
   Barnabas right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen,
   and they unto the circumcision.

   9. Quumque cognovissent gratiam mihi datam Iaeobus et Cephas et
   Ioannes, qui videbantur columnae esse, dextras dederunt mihi ac
   Barnabae societatis, ut nos inter Gentes, ipsi vore in Circumcisionem,
   apestolatu fungerenur.

   10. Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I
   also was forward to do.

   10. Tanturn ut pauperurn memores essenms, in quo et diligens fui, ut
   hoc ipsum facerem.


   6. Of those who seemed to be somewhat. [42] Paul is not yet satisfied,
   without making the Galatians understand that he had learned nothing
   from Peter and the apostles. Hence Porphyry and Julian [43] accuse the
   holy man of pride, because he claims so much for himself that he cannot
   endure to learn anything from others; because he boasts of having
   become a teacher without any instruction or assistance; and because he
   labors so hard not to appear in an inferior character. But any one who
   will consider how necessary that boasting was, will acknowledge that it
   was holy boasting, and worthy of the highest praise; for, if he had
   yielded this point to his opponents, that he had profited under the
   apostles, he would have furnished them with two charges against him.
   They would immediately have said, "And so you made some progress; you
   corrected your past errors, and did not repeat your former rashness."
   Thus, in the first place, the whole doctrine which he had hitherto
   taught would have fallen under suspicion; and, secondly, he would ever
   afterwards have possessed less authority, because he would have been
   reckoned but an ordinary disciple. We find, therefore, that it was not
   on his own account, but by the necessity under which he lay to
   establish the doctrine, that he was led to this holy boasting. The
   controversy has no reference to individuals, and therefore cannot be a
   struggle of ambition; but Paul's determination was that no man, however
   eminent, should throw into the shade his apostleship, on which the
   authority of his doctrine depended. If this be not enough to silence
   those dogs, their barking is sufficiently answered.

   Whatsoever they were. These words must be read as a separate clause;
   for the parenthesis was intended to assure his opponents that he did
   not concern himself with the opinions of men. This passage has been
   variously interpreted. Ambrose thinks that it is a passing reference to
   the folly of attempting to lower Paul by holding up the apostles; and
   represents him as saying; "As if I were not equally at liberty to
   object that they were poor, illiterate men, while I, from my early
   years, enjoyed a liberal education under the care of Gamaliel. But I
   pass over all this, because I know that there is no respect of persons
   with God." Chrysostom and Jerome take a harsher view of the words, as
   an indirect threatening of the most distinguished apostles. "Whatsoever
   they may be, if they swerve from duty, they shall not escape the
   judgment of God; neither the dignity of their office, nor the
   estimation of men, shall protect them." But another interpretation
   appears to me more simple, and more agreeable to Paul's design. He
   admits that they were first in the order of time, but contends that
   this did not prevent him from being their equal in rank. He does not
   say that it is of no consequence to him what they are at present; but
   he is speaking of a period now past, when they were already apostles,
   and when he was opposed to the faith of Christ. In short, he does not
   choose that what is past shall decide the matter; and refuses to admit
   the proverb, that he who comes first has the best right.

   No man's person. Besides the interpretations which I have mentioned, a
   third is not unworthy of notice, -- that in the government of the world
   distinctions of rank are admitted, but in the spiritual kingdom of
   Christ they can have no place. There is plausibility in the statement,
   but it is in reference to worldly government, that it is said,

   "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment,."
   (Deuteronomy 1:17.)

   But I do not enter into that argument, for it does not affect this
   passage. Paul simply means, that the honorable rank which the apostles
   had attained did not prevent him from being called by God, and raised,
   all at once, from the lowest condition to be their equal. The
   difference between them, though great, is of no value in the sight of
   God, who does not accept persons, and whose calling is not influenced
   by any prejudices. But this view may likewise appear liable to
   objection; for, granting it to be true, and a truth which must be
   carefully maintained, that in our intercourse with God there is no
   respect of persons, how does this apply to Peter and his
   fellow-apostles, who were venerable, not merely for their rank, but for
   true holiness and spiritual gifts?

   The word person is contrasted with the fear of God and a good
   conscience; and this is its ordinary acceptation in Scripture. (Acts
   10:34,35 1 Peter 1:17.) But piety, zeal, holiness, and other similar
   graces, were the principal grounds of the esteem and respect in which
   the apostles were held; while Paul speaks contemptuously of them, as if
   they had possessed nothing but the outward forms.

   I reply: Paul is not discussing the real worth of the apostles, but the
   idle boasting of his adversaries. In order to support their own
   unfounded pretensions, they talked in lofty terms of Peter, and James,
   and John, and took advantage of the veneration with which they were
   regarded by the Church, for accomplishing their earnest desire of
   degrading Paul. His object is not to inquire what the apostles are, or
   what opinion must be formed respecting them when controversy is laid
   aside, but to tear off the disguises which the false apostles wore. As
   in a subsequent part of the Epistle he treats of circumcision, not in
   its real character, but in the false and impious notion attached to it
   by those impostors, so he now declares that the apostles were in the
   sight of God disguises, by which those persons attempted to shine in
   the world; and this is evident from the words. Why did they prefer them
   to Paul? because they were his predecessors in office. This was a mere
   disguise. In any other point of view, they would have been highly
   esteemed, and the gifts of God manifested in them would have been
   warmly admired by one so singularly modest as the apostle Paul, who
   elsewhere acknowledges that he was "the least of the apostles," and
   unworthy to occupy so exalted a station.

   "I am the least of the apostles, and not worthy to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God."
   (1 Corinthians 15:9.)

   They communicated nothing to me. It might also be rendered, "they
   communicated nothing with me;" for it is the same word which he
   formerly used twice. [44] But the meaning is the same. When the
   apostles had heard Paul's gospel, they did not on the other side bring
   forward their own, (as is commonly done when something better and more
   perfect is desired,) but were satisfied with his explanation, and
   simply and unhesitatingly embraced his doctrine, so that not even on
   the most doubtful point did a single word of debate pass between them.
   Nor are we to suppose that Paul, presuming on his superiority, took the
   lead in the discussion, and dictated to his brethren. On the contrary,
   his faith, about which unfavourable rumors had been spread, was fully
   explained by him, and sanctioned by their appropation.

   7. But, on the contrary. They immediately gave him the right hand of
   fellowship. (Galatians 2:9.) Consequently they gave their testimony to
   his doctrine, and without any exception; for they produced nothing on
   the other side, as is commonly done on debated points, but acknowledged
   that he held the same gospel in common with them, and was therefore
   entitled to the honors and rank of an associate. Now, one condition of
   this fellowship was, that they distributed the provinces among
   themselves. They were therefore equal, and there was no subjection on
   the part of Paul. To "give the right hands of fellowship" means here,
   to have a partnership settled by mutual agreement.

   When they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to
   me. He asserts that he was not indebted to the apostles for the favor
   of being made an apostle by their consent and approbation, but that, in
   conceding to him the apostleship, they only refused to take away what
   God had given. He constantly urges that he was made an apostle by the
   gift and appointment of God, but adds here that he was acknowledged as
   such by the apostles themselves. Hence it followed, that those
   unprincipled men were attempting, what the apostles durst not have
   attempted, to oppose the election of God.

   And here he begins to claim what belonged to himself in preference to
   others, the apostleship of the uncircumcision. For Paul and Barnabas
   differed from the rest in this respect, that they had been appointed to
   be apostles of the Gentiles. (Acts 13:2.) That had been done by a
   Divine revelation, which the apostles not only did not oppose, but
   determined to ratify, because not to obey it, would have been impious.
   This shows us in what manner they arranged their respective duties, in
   compliance with a Divine revelation, namely, that Paul and Barnabas
   should be the apostles of the Gentiles, and that the others should be
   the apostles of the Jews.

   But this appears to be at variance with the command of Christ, which
   enjoins that the twelve shall

   "go unto all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." (Mark
   16:15.)

   I reply, that command was not intended to apply specifically to each
   individual, but describes in general terms the design of the apostolic
   office, which was, that salvation must be proclaimed to all nations by
   the doctrine of the gospel. For the apostles evidently did not travel
   over the whole world; nay, it is probable that not one of the twelve
   ever passed into Europe. What they allege about Peter may, for aught I
   know, be fabulous, and is, at all events, quite uncertain.

   All of them, it will be objected, had still a commission both to
   Gentiles and to Jews. I own they had, as occasion offered. Each
   apostle, I grant, was entrusted with the publication of the gospel both
   among Gentiles and Jews; for the distribution was not of such a nature
   as to assign them fixed boundaries, like those of kingdoms,
   principalities, and provinces, which could not lawfully be passed. We
   see that Paul, wherever he went, uniformly offered his labors and
   services, in the first instance, to the Jews. As he had a right, while
   living among the Gentiles, to offer himself as an apostle and teacher
   to the Jews; so the others were at liberty, wherever they had it in
   their power, to bring Gentiles to Christ; and we find Peter exercising
   this privilege with regard to Cornelius and others. (Acts 10:1.) But as
   there were other apostles in that district, which was almost wholly
   inhabited by Jews, Paul traveled through Asia, Greece, and other
   distant parts, and on this occasion was specially ordained to be an
   apostle to the Gentiles. Nay, when the Lord first commanded him to be
   set apart, he directed him to leave Antioch and Syria, and perform
   voyages to distant countries for the sake of the Gentiles. On ordinary
   occasions, therefore, he was the apostle of the Gentiles, and on
   extraordinary occasions, he was the apostle of the Jews. The other
   apostles, again, took the Jews for their own department, but with the
   understanding that, when an opportunity occurred, they would be at
   liberty to direct their ministrations to the Gentiles; this last,
   however, being in their case an extraordinary service.

   But if Peter's apostleship had a peculiar reference to the Jews, let
   the Romanists see on what ground they derive from him their succession
   to the primacy. If the Pope of Rome claims the primacy because he is
   Peter's successor, he ought to exercise it over the Jews. Paul is here
   declared to be the chief apostle of the Gentiles, yet they affirm that
   he was not bishop of Rome; and, therefore, if the Pope would establish
   any claim to his primacy, let him gather churches from among the Jews.
   He who by a decree of the Holy Spirit, and by the consent of the whole
   apostolic college, has been solemnly declared to be one of the
   apostles, cannot but be acknowledged by us in that character. Those who
   would transfer that right to Peter set aside all ordination, both human
   and divine. It is unnecessary to explain here the well-known metaphor
   in the words circumcision and uncircumcision, as applied to Jews and
   Gentiles.

   8. He that wrought effectually. That the province which had been
   assigned to him was truly his own, is proved by the exertion of divine
   power during his ministry. Now, this manifestation of divine energy, as
   we have frequently seen, is the seal by which his doctrine was
   attested, and his office as a teacher sanctioned. Whether Paul refers
   God's effectual working to the success of his preaching, or to the
   graces of the Holy Spirit which were then bestowed on believers, is
   doubtful. I do not understand it as denoting the mere success, but the
   spiritual power and efficacy, [45] which he has elsewhere mentioned. (1
   Corinthians 2:4.) The amount of the whole is, that it was no idle
   bargain which the apostles had made among themselves, but a decision
   which God had sealed.

   9. And when they perceived the grace. They who treated with contempt
   the grace of God, by which the most eminent apostles had been led to
   admire and reverence Paul, are charged with hateful and proud disdain.
   If they should allege that they were ignorant of that which the
   apostles knew from the beginning, the hypocritical pretense was not to
   be endured. This admonishes us to yield to the grace of God, wherever
   it is perceived, unless we choose to contend with the Holy Spirit,
   whose will it is that his gifts shall not remain unemployed. The grace
   which the apostles perceived to have been given to Paul and Barnabas,
   induced them to sanction their ministry by receiving them as their
   associates.

   James and Cephas. I have already stated, that James was the son of
   Alpheus. He could not be "the brother of John" who had been lately put
   to death by Herod, (Acts 12:2,) and to suppose that one of the
   disciples had been placed above the apostles would be absurd. That he
   held the highest rank among the apostles, is made evident by Luke, who
   ascribes to him the summing up and decision of the cause in the
   council, (Acts 15:13,) and afterwards mentions his having assembled
   "all the elders" of the church of Jerusalem. (Acts 21:18.) When he
   says, that they seemed to be pillars, he does not speak contemptuously,
   but quotes the general opinion, arguing from it, that what was done by
   such men ought not to be lightly set aside. In a question relating to
   diversity of rank, it is surprising that James should be mentioned
   before Peter; but the reason perhaps is, that he presided over the
   church at Jerusalem. As to the word pillar, we know that, from the
   nature of things, those who excel in ability, prudence, or other gifts,
   possess greater authority. And even in the Church of God, he who enjoys
   a larger measure of grace ought, on that account, to receive the higher
   honor. It argues ingratitude, nay impiety, not to worship the Spirit of
   God wherever he appears in his gifts; and as a people cannot want a
   pastor, so the assemblies of pastors require a moderator. But in all
   cases let the rule be followed,

   "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant"
   (Matthew 23:11.)

   10. That we should remember the poor. It is evident that the brethren
   who were in Judea labored under extreme poverty: otherwise they would
   not have burdened other churches. That might arise both from the
   various calamities which befell the whole nation, and from the cruel
   rage of their own countrymen, by which they were every day stript of
   their possessions. It was proper that they should receive assistance
   from the Gentiles, who owed to them the inestimable benefit of the
   gospel. Paul says, that he was forward to do, that he faithfully
   performed, what the apostles had requested from him, and thus he takes
   away from his adversaries a pretext which they were desirous to seize.

   Galatians 2:11-16

   11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
   because he was to be blamed.

   11. Quum autem venisset Petrus Antiochiam, palam ei restiti, eo quod
   reprehensione dignus esset.

   12. For, before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
   Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself,
   fearing them which were of the circumcision.

   12. Nam antequam venissent quidam ab Iacobo, una cum Gentibus sumebat
   cibum; quum autem venissent, subduxit ac separavit se ab illis, metuens
   eos qui erant ex Circumcisione.

   13. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
   Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

   13. Acts simulabant una cum illo caeteri quoque Iudeai, adeo ut
   Barnabas simul abduceretur in illorum simulationem.

   14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the
   truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being
   a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why
   compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

   14. Verum ubi vidissem, quod non recto pede incederent ad veritatem
   evangelii, dixi Petro coram omnibus: Si tu, quum sis Iudaeus,
   Gentiliter vivis, et non Iudaice; cur cogis Gentes Iudaizare?

   15. We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

   15. Nos natura Iudaei, et non ex Gentibus peccatores,

   16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
   the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that
   we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of
   the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

   16. Cognito, non justificari hominem ex operibus legis, nisi per fidem
   Iesu Christi, et nos in Iesum Christum credidimus, ut justificaremur ex
   fide Christi, et non ex operibus legis; propterea quod non
   justificabitur ex operibus legis onmis care.


   11. When Peter was come. Whoever will carefully examine all the
   circumstances, will, I trust, agree with me in thinking, that this
   happened before the apostles had decided that the Gentiles should
   receive no annoyance about ceremonial observances. (Acts 15:28.) For
   Peter would have entertained no dread of offending James, or those sent
   by him, after that decision had been passed: but such was the
   dissimulation of Peter, that, in opposing it, Paul was driven to assert
   "the truth of the gospel." At first he said, that the certainty of his
   gospel does not in any degree depend on Peter and the apostles, so as
   to stand or fall by their judgment. Secondly, he said, that it had been
   approved by all without any exception or contradiction, and
   particularly by those who were universally admitted to hold the highest
   place. Now, as I have said, he goes further, and asserts that he had
   blamed Peter for leaning to the other side; and he proceeds to explain
   the cause of the dispute. It was no ordinary proof of the strength of
   his doctrine, that he not only obtained their cordial approbation, but
   firmly maintained it in a debate with Peter, and came off victorious.
   What reason could there now be for hesitating to receive it as certain
   and undoubted truth?

   At the same time, this is a reply to another calumny, that Paul was but
   an ordinary disciple, far below the rank of an apostle: for the reproof
   which he administered was an evidence that the parties were on an equal
   footing. The highest, I acknowledge, are sometimes properly reproved by
   the lowest, for this liberty on the part of inferiors towards their
   superiors is permitted by God; and so it does not follow, that he who
   reproves another must be his equal. But the nature of the reproof
   deserves notice. Paul did not simply reprove Peter, as a Christian
   might reprove a Christian, but he did it officially, as the phrase is;
   that is, in the exercise of the apostolic character which he sustained.

   This is another thunderbolt which strikes the Papacy of Rome. It
   exposes the impudent pretensions of the Roman Antichrist, who boasts
   that he is not bound to assign a reason, and sets at defiance the
   judgment of the whole Church. Without rashness, without undue boldness,
   but in the exercise of the power granted him by God, this single
   individual chastises Peter, in the presence of the whole Church; and
   Peter submissively bows to the chastisement. Nay, the whole debate on
   those two points was nothing less than a manifest overthrow of that
   tyrannical primacy, which the Romanists foolishly enough allege to be
   founded on divine right. If they wish to have God appearing on their
   side, a new Bible must be manufactured; if they do not wish to have him
   for an open enemy, those two chapters of the Holy Scriptures must be
   expunged.

   Because he was worthy of blame. The Greek participle, kategnosmenos,
   signifies Blamed, so that the words run, "because he was blamed;" but I
   have no doubt whatever, that the word was intended to express, "one who
   deserves just blame." Chrysostom makes the meaning to be, that others
   had previously indulged in complaint and accusation; but this is really
   trifling. It was customary with the Greeks to give to their participles
   the signification of nouns, which, every person must see, is applicable
   to this passage. This will enable us to perceive the absurdity of the
   interpretation given by Jerome and Chrysostom, who represent the whole
   transaction as a feigned debate, which the apostles had previously
   arranged to take place in presence of the people. They are not even
   supported by the phrase, "I withstood him to the face, kata prosopon,
   which means that "to the face," or "being present," Peter was chastised
   and struck dumb. The observation of Chrysostom, that, for the sake of
   avoiding scandal, they would have talked in private if they had any
   difference, is frivolous. The less important must be disregarded in
   comparison of the most dangerous of all scandals, that the Church would
   be rent, that Christian liberty was in danger, that the doctrine of the
   grace of Christ was overthrown; and therefore this public offense must
   be publicly corrected.

   The chief argument on which Jerome rests is excessively trifling. "Why
   should Paul," says he, "condemn in another what he takes praise for in
   himself? for he boasts that to the Jews he became as a Jew.'" (1
   Corinthians 9:20.) I reply, that what Peter did is totally different.
   Paul accommodated himself to the Jews no farther than was consistent
   with the doctrine of liberty; and therefore he refused to circumcise
   Titus, that the truth of the gospel might remain unimpaired. But Peter
   Judaized in such a manner as to "compel the Gentiles" to suffer
   bondage, and at the same time to create a prejudice against Paul's
   doctrine. He did not, therefore, observe the proper limit; for he was
   more desirous to please than to edify, and more solicitous to inquire
   what would gratify the Jews than what would be expedient for the whole
   body. Augustine is therefore right in asserting, that this was no
   previously arranged plan, but that Paul, out of Christian zeal, opposed
   the sinful and unseasonable dissimulation of Peter, because he saw that
   it would be injurious to the Church.

   12. For before that certain persons came. The state of the case is here
   laid down. For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from
   the Gentiles, in order to drive them from the communion of the Church,
   unless they would relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to
   the yoke of the Law. If Paul had been silent here, his whole doctrine
   fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined. It was
   therefore necessary that he should rise manfully, and fight with
   courage. This shews us how cautiously we ought to guard against giving
   way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please, or an
   undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right
   path. If this might happen to Peter, how much more easily may it happen
   to us, if we are not duly careful!

   14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly. Some apply these
   words to the Gentiles, who, perplexed by Peter's example, were
   beginning to give way; but it is more natural to understand them as
   referring to Peter and Barnabas, and their followers. The proper road
   to the truth of the gospel was, to unite the Gentiles with the Jews in
   such a manner that the true doctrine should not be injured. But to bind
   the consciences of godly men by an obligation to keep the law, and to
   bury in silence the doctrine of liberty, was to purchase unity at an
   exorbitant price.

   The truth of the gospel is here used, by Paul, in the same sense as
   before, and is contrasted with those disguises by which Peter and
   others concealed its beauty. In such a case, the struggle which Paul
   had to maintain must unquestionably have been serious. They were
   perfectly agreed about doctrine; [46] but since, laying doctrine out of
   view, Peter yielded too submissively to the Jews, he is accused of
   halting. There are some who apologize for Peter on another ground,
   because, being the apostle of the circumcision, he was bound to take a
   particular concern in the salvation of the Jews; while they at the same
   time admit that Paul did right in pleading the cause of the Gentiles.
   But it is foolish to defend what the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Paul
   has condemned. This was no affair of men, but involved the purity of
   the gospel, which was in danger of being contaminated by Jewish leaven.

   Before them all. This example instructs us, that those who have sinned
   publicly must be publicly chastised, so far as concerns the Church. The
   intention is, that their sin may not, by remaining unpunished, form a
   dangerous example; and Paul elsewhere (1 Timothy 5:20) lays down this
   rule expressly, to be observed in the case of elders,

   "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear;"

   because the station which they hold renders their example more
   pernicious. It was particularly advantageous, that the good cause, in
   which all had an interest, should be openly defended in presence of the
   people, that Paul might have a better opportunity of shewing that he
   did not shrink from the broad light of day.

   If thou, being a Jew. Paul's address to Peter consists of two parts. In
   the first, he expostulates with him for his injustice toward the
   Gentiles, in compelling them to keep the law, from the obligations of
   which he wished himself to be exempted. For, not to mention that every
   man is bound to keep the law which he lays down for others, his conduct
   was greatly aggravated by compelling the Gentiles to observe Jewish
   ceremonies, while he, being a Jew, left himself at liberty. The law was
   given to Jews, not to Gentiles; so that he argues from the less to the
   greater.

   Next, it is argued, that, in a harsh and violent manner, he compelled
   the Gentiles, by withdrawing from their communion, unless they chose to
   submit to the yoke of the law; and thus imposed on them an unjust
   condition. And, indeed, the whole force of the reproof lies in this
   word, which neither Chrysostom nor Jerome has remarked. The use of
   ceremonies was free for the purposes of edification, provided that
   believers were not deprived of their liberty, or laid under any
   restraint from which the gospel sets them free.

   15. We who are Jews by nature. Some, I am aware, think that this is
   stated in the form of an objection, (anthupophora,) anticipating what
   might be urged on the other side, that the Jews possessed higher
   privileges; not that they would boast of exemption from the law, (for
   it would have been highly absurd, that they to whom the Law was given
   should make this their boast,) but that there was a propriety in
   retaining some points of distinction between them and the Gentiles. I
   do not entirely reject, and yet, as will afterwards appear, I do not
   altogether adopt this view. Some, again, consider that it is Paul
   himself who uses this argument, "If you were to lay upon the Jews the
   burden of the law, it would be more reasonable, because it is theirs by
   inheritance." But neither do I approve of this view.

   He is now proceeding to the second part of his speech, which commences
   with an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in this respect,
   that they were "unholy and profane," (1 Timothy 1:9;) while the Jews,
   being holy, so far as God had chosen them for his people, might contend
   for this superiority. Skilfully anticipating the objection, Paul turns
   it to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all
   their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of
   Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look
   for salvation through faith? Paul's meaning therefore is: "We, who
   appear to excel others, -- we, who, by means of the covenant, have
   always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, (Deuteronomy 4:7,)
   have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in
   Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles?
   For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those
   who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous
   to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook
   ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged
   upon the Gentiles."

   The word sinner, signifies here, as in many other places, a "profane
   person," (Hebrews 12:16,) or one who is lost and alienated from God.
   Such were the Gentiles, who had no intercourse with God; while the Jews
   were, by adoption, the children of God, and therefore set apart to
   holiness. By nature, does not mean that they were naturally free from
   the corruption of the human race; for David, who was a descendant of
   Abraham, acknowledges,

   "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity,
   and in sin did my mother conceive me," (Psalm 51:5,)

   but the corruption of nature, to which they were liable, had been met
   by the remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise made the
   blessing hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just as, in the
   Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from a "holy
   root." (Romans 11:16.)

   When he says, we are Jews by nature, his meaning is, "We are born holy:
   not certainly by our own merit, but because God hath chosen us to be
   his people." Well, then, we who were by nature Jews, what have we done?
   "We have believed in Jesus Christ." What was the design of our
   believing? "That we might be justified by the faith of Christ." For
   what reason? Because we "know that a man is not justified by the works
   of the law." From the nature and effect of faith, he reasons that the
   Jews are in no degree justified by the law. For, as they who

   "go about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted
   themselves to the righteousness of God," (Romans 10:3,)

   so, on the contrary, they who believe in Christ, confess that they are
   sinners, and renounce justification by works. This involves the main
   question, or rather, in this single proposition nearly the whole
   controversy is embodied. It is the more necessary to bestow some care
   on the examination of this passage.

   The first thing to be noticed is, that we must seek justification by
   the faith of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works. Now, the
   question is, what is meant by the works of the law? The Papists, misled
   by Origen and Jerome, are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that
   the dispute relates to shadows; and accordingly assert, that by "the
   works of the law" are meant ceremonies. As if Paul were not reasoning
   about the free justification which is bestowed on us by Christ. For
   they see no absurdity in maintaining that "no man is justified by the
   works of the law," and yet that, by the merit of works, we are
   accounted righteous in the sight of God. In short, they hold that no
   mention is here made of the works of the moral law. But the context
   clearly proves that the moral law is also comprehended in these words;
   for almost everything which Paul afterwards advances belongs more
   properly to the moral than to the ceremonial law; and he is continually
   employed in contrasting the righteousness of the law with the free
   acceptance which God is pleased to bestow.

   It is objected by our opponents, that the term "works" must have been
   employed without any addition, if Paul had not intended to limit it to
   a particular class. But I reply, there is the best of all reasons for
   this mode of expression; for, though a man were to excel all the angels
   in holiness, no reward is due to works, but on the footing of a Divine
   promise. Perfect obedience to the law is righteousness, and has a
   promise of eternal life annexed to it; but it derives this character
   from God, who declares that "they who have fulfilled them shall live."
   (Leviticus 18:5.) On this point we shall afterwards treat more fully in
   its own place. [47] Besides, the controversy with the Jews was about
   the law. Paul, therefore, chose rather to bring the matter to an issue,
   by meeting them at once on their own ground, than to adopt a more
   circuitous route, which might wear the aspect of evading the subject,
   or distrusting his cause. Accordingly he resolves to have a close
   debate about the law.

   Their second objection is, that the whole question raised was about
   ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why then, say they, would the
   apostle pass suddenly from a particular department to the whole
   subject? This was the sole cause of the mistake into which Origen and
   Jerome were betrayed; for they did not think it natural that, while the
   false apostles were contending about ceremonies alone, Paul should take
   in a larger field. But they did not consider that the very reason for
   disputing so keenly was, that the doctrine led to more serious
   consequences than at first view appeared. It would not have given so
   much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies should be observed, as that the
   confident hope and the glory of salvation should be made to rest on
   works; just as, in the dispute about forbidding flesh on certain days,
   we do not look so much to the importance of the prohibition itself, as
   to the snare which is laid for the consciences of men. Paul, therefore,
   does not wander from the subject, when he enters into a controversy
   about the whole law, although the arguments of the false apostles were
   confined wholly to ceremonies. Their object in pressing ceremonies was,
   that men might seek salvation by obedience to the law, which, they
   falsely maintained, was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul meets them,
   not with the moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet
   this extended discussion does not occupy the whole of the Epistle; he
   comes at length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most
   serious difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by
   works or by faith, it was proper that this should be first settled. As
   the Papists of the present day are uneasy when we extort from them the
   acknowledgment that men are justified by faith alone, they reluctantly
   admit that "the works of the law" include those of a moral nature. Many
   of them, however, by quoting Jerome's gloss, imagine that they have
   made a good defense; but the context will show that the words relate
   also to the moral law. [48]

   16. But by the faith of Jesus Christ. He does not merely state that
   ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the
   assistance of faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting of
   no exception, as if he had said, "Not by works, but by the Gift of
   Christ alone." In any other point of view, the sentiment would have
   been trivial and foreign to the purpose; for the false apostles did not
   reject Christ nor faith, but demanded that ceremonies should be joined
   with them. If Paul had admitted this claim, they would have been
   perfectly at one, and he would have been under no necessity to agitate
   the church by this unpleasant debate. Let it therefore remain settled,
   that the proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception, "that we
   are justified in no other way than by faith," or, "that we are not
   justified but by faith," or, which amounts to the same thing, "that we
   are justified by faith alone."

   Hence it appears with what silly trifling the Papists of our day
   dispute with us about the word, as if it had been a word of our
   contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the theology of the
   Papists, who declare that a man is justified by faith, and yet make a
   part of justification to consist in works. Of such half-justification
   Paul knew nothing. For, when he instructs us that we are justified by
   faith, because we cannot be justified by works, he takes for granted
   what is true, that we cannot be justified through the righteousness of
   Christ, unless we are poor and destitute of a righteousness of our own.
   [49] Consequently, either nothing or all must be ascribed to faith or
   to works. As to the word justification, and the manner in which faith
   is the cause of it, we shall afterwards see.

   By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. He had already
   appealed to the consciences of Peter and others, and now confirms it
   more fully by affirming that such is the actual truth, that by the
   works of the law no mortal will obtain justification. This is the
   foundation of a freely bestowed righteousness, when we are stripped of
   a righteousness of our own. Besides, when he asserts that no mortal is
   justified by the righteousness of the law, the assertion amounts to
   this, that from such a mode of justification all mortals are excluded,
   and that none can possibly reach it.

   Galatians 2:17-21

   17. But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also
   are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.

   17. Porro si quaerentes justificari in Christo, inventi sumus ipsi
   quoque peccatores, ergo Christus peceati minister est? absit.

   18. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a
   transgressor.

   18. Nam si quae destruxi haec rursum aedifieo, praevaricatorem me ipsum
   constituo.

   19. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
   God.

   19. Ego enim per Legem Legi mortuus sum. Ut Deo viverem,

   20. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live
   by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

   20. Cum Christo sum crucifixus; vivo autem non amplius ego, sed vivit
   in me Christus; quod autem nunc vivo in carne, in fide vivo Filii Dei,
   qui dilexit me, et tradidit se ipsum pro me.

   21. I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by
   the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

   21. Non abjicio gratiam Dei; si enim per Legem justitia, ergo Christus
   gratis mortuus est.


   17. If, while we seek to be justified. He now returns to the Galatians.
   We must take care not to connect this verse with the preceding one, as
   if it were a part of the speech addressed to Peter: for what had Peter
   to do with this argument? It certainly has very little, if anything, to
   do with the speech; but let every one form his own opinion.

   Chrysostom, and some other commentators, make the whole passage to be
   an affirmation, and interpret it thus: "If, while we seek to be
   justified by Christ, we are not yet perfectly righteous, but still
   unholy, and if, consequently, Christ is not sufficient for our
   righteousness, it follows that Christ is the minister of the doctrine
   which leaves men in sin:" supposing that, by this absurd proposition,
   Paul insinuates a charge of blasphemy against those who attribute a
   part of justification to the law. But as the expression of indignant
   abhorrence immediately follows, which Paul is never accustomed to
   employ but in answer to questions, I am rather inclined to think that
   the statement is made for the purpose of setting aside an absurd
   conclusion which his doctrine appeared to warrant. He puts a question,
   in his usual manner, into the mouth of his antagonists. "If, in
   consequence of the righteousness of faith, we, who are Jews and were
   sanctified from the womb,' (Jeremiah 1:5 Galatians 1:15,) are reckoned
   guilty and polluted, shall we say that Christ makes sin to be powerful
   in his own people, and that he is therefore the author of sin?"

   This suspicion arose from his having said that Jews, by believing in
   Christ, renounce the righteousness of the law; for, while they are
   still at a distance from Christ, Jews, separated from the ordinary
   pollution of the Gentiles, appear to be in some respects exempted from
   the appellation of sinners. The grace of Christ places them on a level
   with the Gentiles; and the remedy, which is common to both, shews that
   both had labored under the same disease. This is the force of the
   particle also, -- we ourselves also, -- meaning not any description of
   men, but the Jews, who stood highest.

   Far from it. He properly rejects that inference. Christ, who discovers
   the sin which lay concealed, is not therefore the minister of sin; as
   if, by depriving us of righteousness, he opened the gate to sin, or
   strengthened its dominion. [50] The Jews were mistaken in claiming any
   holiness for themselves apart from Christ, while they had none. Hence
   arose the complaint: "Did Christ come to take from us the righteousness
   of the law, to change saints into polluted men, to subject us to sin
   and guilt?" Paul denies it, and repels the blasphemy with abhorrence.
   Christ did not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away
   righteousness, but stripped the Jews of a false disguise.

   18. For if I build again. The reply consists of two parts. This is the
   first part, and informs us that the supposition now made is at variance
   with his whole doctrine, since he had preached the faith of Christ in
   such a manner as to connect with it the ruin and destruction of sin.
   For, as we are taught by John, that Christ came not to build up the
   kingdom of sin, but "that he might destroy the works of the devil," (1
   John 3:8,) so Paul declares, that, in preaching the gospel, he had
   restoreth true righteousness, in order that sin might be destroyed. It
   was, therefore, in the highest degree improbable, that the same person
   who destroyed sin should renew its power; and, by stating the
   absurdity, he repels the calumny.

   19. For I through the law. Now follows the direct reply, that we must
   not ascribe to Christ that work which properly belongs to the law. It
   was not necessary that Christ should destroy the righteousness of the
   law, for the law itself slays its disciples. As if he had said, "You
   deceive wretched men by the false notion, that they must live by the
   law; and, under that pretext, you keep them in the law. And yet you
   bring it as a charge against the Gospel, that it annihilates the
   righteousness which we have by the law. But it is the law which forces
   us to die to itself; for it threatens our destruction, leaves us
   nothing but despair, and thus drives us away from trusting to the law."

   This passage will be better understood by comparing it with the seventh
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. There Paul describes beautifully,
   that no man lives to the law, but he to whom the law is dead, that is,
   has lost all power and efficacy; for, as soon as the law begins to live
   in us, it inflicts a fatal wound by which we die, and at the same time
   breathes life into the man who is already dead to sin. Those who live
   to the law, therefore, have never felt the power of the law, or
   properly understood what the law means; for the law, when truly
   perceived, makes us die to itself, and it is from this source, and not
   from Christ, that sin proceeds.

   To die to the law, may either mean that we renounce it, and are
   delivered from its dominion, so that we have no confidence in it, and,
   on the other hand, that it does not hold us captives under the yoke of
   slavery; or it may mean, that, as it allures us all to destruction, we
   find in it no life. The latter view appears to be preferable. It is not
   to Christ, he tells us, that it is owing that the law is more hurtful
   than beneficial; but the law carries within itself the curse which
   slays us. Hence it follows, that the death which is brought on by the
   law is truly deadly. With this is contrasted another kind of death, in
   the life-giving fellowship of the cross of Christ. He says, that he is
   crucified together with Christ, that he might live unto God. The
   ordinary punctuation of this passage obscures the true meaning. It is
   this: "I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God."
   But the context will read more smoothly thus: "I through the law am
   dead to the law;" then, in a separate sentence, "That I might live to
   God, I am crucified with Christ."

   That I might live to God. He shews that the kind of death, on which the
   false apostles seized as a ground of quarrel, is a proper object of
   desire; for he declares that we are dead to the law, not by any means
   that we may live to sin, but that we may live to God. To live to God,
   sometimes means to regulate our life according to his will, so as to
   study nothing else in our whole life but to gain his approbation; but
   here it means to live, if we may be allowed the expression, the life of
   God. In this way the various points of the contrast are preserved; for
   in whatever sense we are said to die to sin, in the same sense do we
   live to God. In short, Paul informs us that this death is not mortal,
   but is the cause of a better life; because God snatches us from the
   shipwreck of the law, and by his grace raises us up to another life. I
   say nothing of other interpretations; but this appears to be the
   apostle's real meaning.

   20. I am crucified with Christ. This explains the manner in which we,
   who are dead to the law, live to God. Ingrafted into the death of
   Christ, we derive from it a secret energy, as the twig does from the
   root. Again, the handwriting of the law,

   "which was contrary to us, Christ has nailed to his cross." (Colossians
   2:14.)

   Being then crucified with him, we are freed from all the curse and
   guilt of the law. He who endeavors to set aside that deliverance makes
   void the cross of Christ. But let us remember, that we are delivered
   from the yoke of the law, only by becoming one with Christ, as the twig
   draws its sap from the root, only by growing into one nature.

   Nevertheless I live. To the feelings of man, the word Death is always
   unpleasant. Having said that we are "crucified with Christ," he
   therefore adds, "that this makes us alive."

   Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. This explains what he meant by
   "living to God." He does not live by his own life, but is animated by
   the secret power of Christ; so that Christ may be said to live and grow
   in him; for, as the soul enlivens the body, so Christ imparts life to
   his members. It is a remarkable sentiment, that believers live out of
   themselves, that is, they live in Christ; which can only be
   accomplished by holding real and actual communication with him. Christ
   lives in us in two ways. The one life consists in governing us by his
   Spirit, and directing all our actions; the other, in making us
   partakers of his righteousness; so that, while we can do nothing of
   ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God. The first relates to
   regeneration, the second to justification by free grace. This passage
   may be understood in the latter sense; but if it is thought better to
   apply it to both, I will cheerfully adopt that view.

   And the life which I now live in the flesh. There is hardly a sentence
   here which has not been torn by a variety of interpretations. Some
   understand by the word flesh, the depravity of sinful nature; but Paul
   means by it simply the bodily life, and it is to this that the
   objection applies. "You live a bodily life; but while this corruptible
   body performs its functions, -- while it is supported by eating and
   drinking, this is not the heavenly life of Christ. It is therefore an
   unreasonable paradox to assert, that, while you are openly living after
   the ordinary manner of men, your life is not your own."

   Paul replies, that it consists in faith; which intimates that it is a
   secret hidden from the senses of man. The life, therefore, which we
   attain by faith is not visible to the bodily eye, but is inwardly
   perceived in the conscience by the power of the Spirit; so that the
   bodily life does not prevent us from enjoying, by faith, a heavenly
   life.

   "He hath made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
   (Ephesians 2:6.)

   Again,

   "You are fellow-citizens with the saints and of the
   household of God." (Ephesians 2:19.)

   And again,

   "Our conversation is in heaven." (Philippians 3:20.)

   Paul's writings are full of similar assertions, that, while we live in
   the world, we at the same time live in heaven; not only because our
   Head is there, but because, in virtue of union, we enjoy a life in
   common with him. (John 14:23.)

   Who loved me. This is added to express the power of faith; for it would
   immediately occur to any one, -- whence does faith derive such power as
   to convey into our souls the life of Christ? He accordingly informs us,
   that the love of Christ, and his death, are the objects on which faith
   rests; for it is in this manner that the effect of faith must be
   judged. How comes it that we live by the faith of Christ? Because "he
   loved us, and gave himself for us." The love of Christ led him to unite
   himself to us, and he completed the union by his death. By giving
   himself for us, he suffered in our own person; as, on the other hand,
   faith makes us partakers of every thing which it finds in Christ. The
   mention of love is in accordance with the saying of the apostle John,

   "Not that we loved God, but he anticipated us by his love."
   (1 John 4:10)

   For if any merit of ours had moved him to redeem us, this reason would
   have been stated; but now Paul ascribes the whole to love: it is
   therefore of free grace. Let us observe the order: "He loved us, and
   gave himself for us." As if he had said, "He had no other reason for
   dying, but because he loved us," and that "when we were enemies,"
   (Romans 5:10,) as he argues in another Epistle.

   He gave himself. No words can properly express what this means; for who
   can find language to declare the excellency of the Son of God? Yet he
   it is who gave himself as a price for our redemption. Atonement,
   cleansing, satisfaction, and all the benefits which we derive from the
   death of Christ, are here represented. [51] The words for me, are very
   emphatic. It will not be enough for any man to contemplate Christ as
   having died for the salvation of the world, unless he has experienced
   the consequences of this death, and is enabled to claim it as his own.
   [52]

   21. I do not reject. There is great emphasis in this expression; for
   how dreadful is the ingratitude manifested in despising the grace of
   God, so invaluable in itself, and obtained at such a price! Yet this
   heinous offense is charged against the false apostles, who were not
   satisfied with having Christ alone, but introduced some other aids
   towards obtaining salvation. For, if we do not renounce all other
   hopes, and embrace Christ alone, we reject the grace of God. And what
   resource is left to the man, who "puts from him" the grace of God, "and
   judges himself unworthy of everlasting life?" (Acts 13:46.)

   Christ is dead in vain [53] There would then have been no value in the
   death of Christ; or, Christ would have died without any reward; for the
   reward of his death is, that he has reconciled us to the Father by
   making an atonement for our sins. Hence it follows, that we are
   justified by his grace, and, therefore, not by works. The Papists
   explain this in reference to the ceremonial law; but who does not see
   that it applies to the whole law? If we could produce a righteousness
   of our own, then Christ has suffered in vain; for the intention of his
   sufferings was to procure it for us, and what need was there that a
   work which we could accomplish for ourselves should be obtained from
   another? If the death of Christ be our redemption, then we were
   captives; if it be satisfaction, we were debtors; if it be atonement,
   we were guilty; if it be cleansing, we were unclean. On the contrary,
   he who ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement,
   righteousness, or deliverance, makes void the death of Christ.

   This argument, we shall perhaps be told, is of no weight against those
   who propose to unite the grace of Christ with works; which, it is
   universally admitted, was done by the false apostles. The two
   doctrines, it is alleged, stand together, that righteousness is by the
   law, and that we are redeemed by the death of Christ. True; supposing
   it were granted that a part of our righteousness is obtained by works,
   and a part comes from grace. But such theology, it may easily be
   proved, was unknown to Paul. His argument with his opponents is either
   conclusive or inconclusive. If any blasphemer shall dare to accuse him
   of bad reasoning, a powerful defense is at hand; for that justification
   in the sight of God of which he treats, is not what men may imagine to
   be sufficient, but what is absolutely perfect.

   But we are not now called to plead in behalf of Paul against
   blasphemers, who venture to speak in reproachful language of the Holy
   Spirit himself. Our present business is with the Papists. They ridicule
   us, when we argue with Paul that, if righteousness come by works,
   Christ is dead in vain. They imagine it to be a beautiful reply, with
   which their sophists furnish them, that Christ merited for us the first
   grace, that is, the opportunity of meriting; and that the merit of his
   death concurs with the satisfactions of works for the daily pardon of
   sins. Let them ridicule Paul, whose language we quote. They must refute
   him before they can refute us. We know that he had to deal with men,
   who did not entirely reject the grace of Christ, but ascribed the half
   of salvation to works. In opposition to them he argues, that "if
   righteousness is by the law, then Christ is dead in vain;" and by so
   doing, he certainly does not allow to works one drop of righteousness.
   Between those men and the Papists there is no difference; and
   therefore, in refuting them, we are at liberty to employ Paul's
   argument.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Galatians 3:1-5

   1. O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey
   the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
   forth, crucified among you?

   1. O stulti Galatae, quis vos fascinavit, ut non obediatis veritati?
   quibus ante oculos Iesus Christus depictus est inter vos crucifixus.

   2. This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works
   of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

   2. Hoc solum volo discere a vobis: Ex operibus Legis Spiritum
   accepistis, an ex praedicatione fidei?

   3. Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
   perfect by the flesh?

   3. Ita stulti estis, ut, exorsi a Spiritu, nunc carne eonsummemini?

   4. Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

   4. Tanta passi estis frustra? si tamen etiam frustra.

   5. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
   miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
   hearing of faith?

   5. Qui ergo subministrat vobis Spiritum, et operatur in vobis virtutes;
   ex operibus legis, an ex praedieatione fidei id (facit)?


   1. O foolish Galatians. An expostulation is here interwoven -- I should
   rather say, inserted -- amidst his doctrinal statements. Some will
   wonder that he did not delay it to the close of the Epistle, but the
   very serious nature of the errors which he has brought forward
   unquestionably roused him to a burst of passion. When we hear that the
   Son of God, with all his benefits, is rejected, that his death is
   esteemed as nothing, what pious mind would not break out into
   indignation? He therefore declares that those who allowed themselves to
   be involved in so heinous a crime must have been anoetoi, that is,
   "disordered in mind." He accuses them not only of having suffered
   themselves to be deceived, but of having been carried away by some sort
   of magical enchantment, [54] which is a still more serious charge. He
   insinuates that their fall partook more of madness than of folly.

   Some think that Paul refers to the temper of the nation, that, being
   sprung from barbarians, it was more difficult to train them; but I
   rather think that he refers to the subject itself. It looks like
   something supernatural, that, after enjoying the gospel in such
   clearness, they should be affected by the delusions of Satan. He does
   not merely say that they were "bewitched" and "disordered in mind,"
   because they did not obey the truth; but because, after having received
   instruction so clear, so full, so tender, and so powerful, they
   immediately fell away. Erasmus has chosen to interpret the words, "that
   ye should not believe the truth." I am not quite prepared to set aside
   that rendering, but would prefer the word obey, because Paul does not
   charge them with having, from the outset, rejected the gospel, but with
   not having persevered in obedience.

   Before whose eyes. This is intended, as I have already hinted, to
   express an aggravation; for, the better opportunities they had of
   knowing Christ, the more heinous was the criminality of forsaking him.
   Such, he tells them, was the clearness of his doctrine, that it was not
   naked doctrine, but the express, living image of Christ. [55] They had
   known Christ in such a manner, that they might be almost said to have
   seen him.

   Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth. Augustine's interpretation
   of the word proegraphe, ("hath been set forth,") is harsh, and
   inconsistent with Paul's design. He makes it to signify that Christ was
   to be thrust out from possession. Others propose a different phrase,
   (proscriptus,) which, if used in the sense of "openly proclaimed,"
   would not be inapplicable. The Greeks, accordingly, borrow from this
   verb the word programmata, to denote boards on which property intended
   to be sold was published, so as to be exposed to the view of all. But
   the participle, painted, is less ambiguous, and, in my own opinion, is
   exceedingly appropriate. To shew how energetic his preaching was, Paul
   first compares it to a picture, which exhibited to them, in a lively
   manner, the image of Christ.

   But, not satisfied with this comparison, he adds, Christ hath been
   crucified among you, intimating that the actual sight of Christ's death
   could not have affected them more powerfully than his own preaching.
   The view given by some, that the Galatians had "crucified to themselves
   (Hebrews 6:6) the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame;"
   that they had withdrawn from the purity of the gospel; or, at least,
   had lent their ear, and given their confidence, to impostors who
   crucified him, -- appears to me overstrained. The meaning therefore is,
   that Paul's doctrine had instructed them concerning Christ in such a
   manner as if he had been exhibited to them in a picture, nay,
   "crucified among them." Such a representation could not have been made
   by any eloquence, or by "enticing words of man's wisdom," (1
   Corinthians 2:4,) had it not been accompanied by that power of the
   Spirit, of which Paul has treated largely in both the Epistles to the
   Corinthians.

   Let those who would discharge aright the ministry of the gospel learn,
   not merely to speak and declaim, but to penetrate into the consciences
   of men, to make them see Christ crucified, and feel the shedding of his
   blood. [56] When the Church has painters such as these, she no longer
   needs the dead images of wood and stone, she no longer requires
   pictures; both of which, unquestionably, were first admitted to
   Christian temples when the pastors had become dumb and been converted
   into mere idols, or when they uttered a few words from the pulpit in
   such a cold and careless manner, that the power and efficacy of the
   ministry were utterly extinguished.

   2. This one I wish to learn from you. He now proceeds to support his
   cause by additional arguments. The first is drawn from their
   experience, for he reminds them in what manner the gospel was
   introduced among themselves. When they heard the gospel, they received
   the Spirit. It was not to the law, therefore, but to faith, that they
   owed the reception of this benefit. This same argument is employed by
   Peter in the defense which he makes to his brethren for having baptized
   uncircumcised persons. (Acts 10:47.) Paul and Barnabas followed the
   same course in the debate which they maintained at Jerusalem on this
   subject. (Acts 15:2, 12.) There was therefore manifest ingratitude in
   not submitting to the doctrine, by means of which they had received the
   Holy Spirit. The opportunity which he gives them to reply is expressive
   not of doubt, but of greater confidence: for their convictions, founded
   on their own experience, forced them to acknowledge that it was true.

   Faith is here put, by a figure of speech, for the gospel, which is
   elsewhere called "the law of faith," (Romans 3:27,) because it exhibits
   to us the free grace of God in Christ, without any merit of works. The
   Spirit means here, I think, the grace of regeneration, which is common
   to all believers; though I have no objection to understand it as
   referring to the peculiar gifts by which the Lord, at that period,
   honored the preaching of the gospel. [57]

   It may be objected, that the Spirit was not, in this respect, given to
   all. But, it was enough for Paul's purpose, that the Galatians knew
   that the power of the Holy Spirit in his Church had accompanied Paul's
   doctrine, and that believers were variously endowed with the gifts of
   the Spirit for general edification. It may likewise be objected, that
   those gifts were not infallible signs of adoption, and so do not apply
   to the present question. I reply, that it was enough that the Lord had
   confirmed the doctrine of Paul by the visible gifts of his Spirit. A
   still simpler view of the case is, that they had been distinguished by
   the ordinary privilege of adoption, before those impostors had brought
   forward their additions. "In whom," says he to the Ephesians,

   "ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of
   your salvation; in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed
   with that Holy Spirit of promise." (Ephesians 1:13.)

   3. Are ye so foolish? Commentators are not agreed as to what he means
   by the Spirit and by the flesh. He alludes, in my opinion, to what he
   had said about the Spirit. As if he had said, "As the doctrine of the
   gospel brought to you the Holy Spirit, the commencement of your course
   was spiritual; but now ye have fallen into a worse condition, and may
   be said to have fallen from the Spirit into the flesh." The flesh
   denotes either outward and fading flyings, such as ceremonies are,
   particularly when they are separated from Christ; or it denotes dead
   and fading doctrine. There was a strange inconsistency between their
   splendid commencement and their future progress.

   4. Have ye suffered so many things? This is another argument. Having
   suffered so many things in behalf of the gospel, would they now, in an
   instant, lose it all? Nay, he puts it in the way of reproach, if they
   were willing to lose the advantage of so many illustrious struggles
   which they had made for the faith. If the true faith had not been
   delivered to them by Paul, it was rash to suffer anything in defense of
   a bad cause; but they had experienced the presence of God amidst their
   persecutions. Accordingly, he charges the false apostles with ill-will
   in depriving the Galatians of such valuable ornaments. But to mitigate
   the severity of this complaint, he adds, if it be yet in vain; thus
   inspiring their minds with the expectation of something better, and
   rousing them to the exercise of repentance. For the intention of all
   chastisement is, not to drive men to despair, but to lead them to a
   better course.

   5. He therefore that ministereth. He is not now speaking of the grace
   of regeneration, but of the other gifts of the Spirit; for a subject
   different from the preceding one is manifestly introduced. He warns
   them that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are
   the fruits of the gospel, of that gospel which had been preached among
   them by his own lips. Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts
   when they left the gospel, and fled to another kind of doctrine. In
   proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts, to which
   the apostle here adds miracles, they ought the more carefully and
   resolutely to adhere to the gospel.

   Galatians 3:6-9

   6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
   righteousness.

   6. Quemadmodum Abraham credidit Deo, et imputatum est illi in
   justitiam. (Genesis 15:6 Romans 4:3 James 2:23.)

   7. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the
   children of Abraham.

   7. Cognoscite ergo, quod qui ex fide sunt, ii sunt filii Abrahae.

   8. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
   through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee
   shall all nations be blessed.

   8. Scriptura autem, quia praevidebat, quod ex fide justificet Deus
   Gentes, ante evangelizavit Abrahae: In to benedicentur omnes Gentes.
   (Genesis 22:18.)

   9. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

   9. Itaque qui ex fide sunt, benedicuntur cure fideli Abraham.


   Having appealed to facts and experience, he now gives quotations from
   Scripture. And first, he brings forward the example of Abraham.
   Arguments drawn from examples are not always so conclusive, but this is
   one of the most powerful, because neither in the subject nor in the
   person is there any ground of exception. There is no variety of roads
   to righteousness, and so Abraham is called "the father of all them that
   believe," (Romans 4:11,) because he is a pattern adapted to all; nay,
   in his person has been laid down to us the universal rule for obtaining
   righteousness.

   6. Even as Abraham. We must here supply some such phrase as but rather;
   for, having put a question, he resolved instantly to cut off every
   ground of hesitation. At least the phrase "even as," (kathos,) refers
   only to the verse immediately preceding, to the "ministration of the
   Spirit and of miracles by the hearing of faith;" as if he had said,
   that, in the grace bestowed on them, a similarity might be found to the
   case of Abraham.

   Believed God. By this quotation he proves both here, and in the 4th
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, that men are justified by faith,
   because the faith of Abraham was accounted to him, for righteousness.
   (Romans 4:3.) We must here inquire briefly, first, what Paul intends by
   faith; secondly, what is righteousness; and thirdly, why faith is
   represented to be a cause of justification. Faith does not mean any
   kind of conviction which men may have of the truth of God; for though
   Cain had a hundred times exercised faith in God when denouncing
   punishment against him, this had nothing to do with obtaining
   righteousness. Abraham was justified by believing, because, when he
   received from God a promise of fatherly kindness, he embraced it as
   certain. Faith therefore has a relation and respect to such a divine
   promise as may enable men to place their trust and confidence in God.

   As to the word righteousness, we must attend to the phraseology of
   Moses. When he says, that

   "he believed in the Lord,
   and he counted it to him for righteousness," (Genesis 15:6,)

   he intimates that that person is righteous who is reckoned as such in
   the sight of God. Now, since men have not righteousness dwelling within
   themselves, they obtain this by imputation; because God holds their
   faith as accounted for righteousness. We are therefore said to be
   "justified by faith," (Romans 3:28; 5:1,) not because faith infuses
   into us a habit or quality, but because we are accepted by God.

   But why does faith receive such honor as to be entitled a cause of our
   justification? First, we must observe, that it is merely an
   instrumental cause; for, strictly speaking, our righteousness is
   nothing else than God's free acceptance of us, on which our salvation
   is founded. But as the Lord testifies his love and grace in the gospel,
   by offering to us that righteousness of which I have spoken, so we
   receive it by faith. And thus, when we ascribe to faith a man's
   justification, we are not treating of the principal cause, but merely
   pointing out the way in which men arrive at true righteousness. For
   this righteousness is not a quality which exists in men, but is the
   mere gift of God, and is enjoyed by faith only; and not even as a
   reward justly due to faith, but because we receive by faith what God
   freely gives. All such expressions as the following are of similar
   import: We are "justified freely by his grace." (Romans 3:24.) Christ
   is our righteousness. The mercy of God is the cause of our
   righteousness. By the death and resurrection of Christ, righteousness
   has been procured for us. Righteousness is bestowed on us through the
   gospel. We obtain righteousness by faith.

   Hence appears the ridiculousness of the blunder of attempting to
   reconcile the two propositions, that we are justified by faith, and
   that we are justified at the same time by works; for he who is "just by
   faith" (Habakkuk 2:4 Hebrews 10:38) is poor and destitute of personal
   righteousness, and relies on the grace of God alone. And this is the
   reason why Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, concludes that Abraham,
   having obtained righteousness by faith, had no right to glory before
   God. (Romans 4:2.) For it is not said that faith was imputed to him for
   a part of righteousness, but simply for righteousness; so that his
   faith was truly his righteousness. Besides, faith looks at nothing but
   the mercy of God, and a dead and risen Christ. All merit of works is
   thus excluded from being the cause of justification, when the whole is
   ascribed to faith. For faith, -- so far as it embraces the undeserved
   goodness of God, Christ with all his benefits, the testimony of our
   adoption which is contained in the gospel, -- is universally contrasted
   with the law, with the merit of works, and with human excellence. The
   notion of the sophists, that it is contrasted with ceremonies alone,
   will presently be disproved, with little difficulty, from the context.
   Let us therefore remember, that those who are righteous by faith, are
   righteous out of themselves, that is, in Christ.

   Hence, too, we obtain a refutation of the idle cavilling of certain
   persons who evade Paul's reasoning. Moses they tell us, gives the name
   of righteousness to goodness; and so means nothing more than that
   Abraham was reckoned a good man, because he believed God. Giddy minds
   of this description, raised up in our time by Satan, endeavor, by
   indirect slanders, to undermine the certainty of Scripture. Paul knew
   that Moses was not there giving lessons to boys in grammar, but was
   speaking of a decision which God had pronounced, and very properly
   viewed the word righteousness in a theological sense. For it is not in
   that sense in which goodness is mentioned with approbation among men,
   that we are accounted righteous in the sight of God, but only where we
   render perfect obedience to the law. Righteousness is contrasted with
   the transgression of the law, even in its smallest point; and because
   we have it not from ourselves, it is freely given to us by God.

   But here the Jews object that Paul has completely tortured the words of
   Moses to suit his own purpose; for Moses does not here treat of Christ,
   or of eternal life, but only mentions an earthly inheritance. The
   Papists are not very different from the Jews; for, though they do not
   venture to inveigh against Paul, they entirely evade his meaning. Paul,
   we reply, takes for granted, what Christians hold to be a first
   principle, that whatever promises the Lord made to Abraham were
   appendages of that first promise,

   "I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
   (Genesis 15:1.)

   When Abraham received the promise,

   "In multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens,
   and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore" (Genesis 22:17,)

   he did not limit his view to that word, but included it in the grace of
   adoption as a part of the whole, and, in the same manner, every other
   promise was viewed by him as a testimony of God's fatherly kindness,
   which tended to strengthen his hope of salvation. Unbelievers differ
   from the children of God in this respect, that, while they enjoy in
   common with them the bounties of Providence, they devour them like
   cattle, and look no higher. The children of God, on the other hand,
   knowing that all their blessings have been sanctified by the promises,
   acknowledge God in them as their Father. They are often directed, in
   this way, to the hope of eternal life; for they begin with the faith of
   their adoption, which is the foundation of the whole. Abraham was not
   justified merely because he believed that God would "multiply his
   seed," (Genesis 22:17,) but because he embraced the grace of God,
   trusting to the promised Mediator, in whom, as Paul elsewhere declares,
   "all the promises of God are yea and amen." (2 Corinthians 1:20.)

   7. Know ye therefore, or, ye know; for both readings are equally
   agreeable to the Greek termination ginoskete. But it matters little
   which is preferred, for the meaning is the same, only that the old
   translation, (know ye,) which I have followed, is more energetic. [58]
   He says that those "are of faith," who have relinquished all confidence
   in works, and rely on the promise of God alone. It is on the authority
   of Paul himself that we give this interpretation; for in the Epistle to
   the Romans he thus writes:

   "To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
   But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
   ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness." (Romans 4:4,5.)

   To be of faith, therefore, is to rest their righteousness and hope of
   salvation on the mercy of God. That such are the children of God he
   concludes from the preceding statement; for if Abraham was justified by
   faith those who wish to be his children must likewise abide firmly by
   faith. He has omitted one remark, which will be readily supplied, that
   there is no place in the church for any man who is not a son of
   Abraham.

   8. The scripture foreseeing. What he had said in a general manner is
   now applied expressly to the Gentiles; for the calling of the Gentiles
   was a new and extraordinary occurrence. Doubts existed as to the manner
   in which they should be called. Some thought that they were required
   "to be circumcised and to keep the law," (Acts 15:24,) and that
   otherwise they were shut out from having a share in the covenant. But
   Paul shews, on the other hand, that by faith they arrive at the
   blessing, and by faith they must be "in grafted" (Romans 11:17, 24,)
   into the family of Abraham. How does he prove this? Because it is said,
   In thee shall all nations be blessed. These words unquestionably recall
   that all must be blessed in the same manner as Abraham; for he is the
   model, nay, the rule, to be universally observed. Now, he obtained the
   blessing by faith, and in the same manner must it be obtained by all.

   9. Faithful Abraham. This expression is very emphatic. They are
   blessed, not with Abraham as circumcised, nor as entitled to boast of
   the works of the law, nor as a Hebrew, nor as relying on his own
   excellence, but with Abraham, who by faith alone obtained the blessing;
   for no personal quality is here taken into the account, but faith
   alone. The word Blessing is variously employed in Scripture: but here
   it signifies Adoption into the inheritance of eternal life.

   Galatians 3:10-14

   10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for
   it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them.

   10. Quictrnque enim ex operibus Legis sunt, sub maledictione sunt.
   Scripture est enim (Deuteronomy 27:26): Maledictus omnis, qui non
   permanet in omnibus, quae scripta sunt in libro Legis, ut facial ca.

   11. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is
   evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

   11. Quod autem in Lege nerno justificetur apud Deum, patet, quia justus
   ex fide rivet. (Habakkuk 2:4 Romans 1:17 Hebrews 10:38.)

   12. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall
   live in them.

   12. Lex autern non estex fide, sed, Qui fecerit haec homo, rivet in
   ipsis. (Leviticus 18:5.)

   13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
   curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
   tree:

   13. Christus nos redemit a maledictione Legis, factus pro nobis
   maledictio: (scriptum est enim, maledictus omnis qui pependerit in
   ligno, (Deuteronomy 21:23,)

   14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
   Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
   faith.

   14. Ut in Gentes benedictio Abrabae perveniat per Christum Iesnrn; quo
   promissionern Spiritus aecipiaruns per fidem.


   10. For as many as are of the works of the law. The argument is drawn
   from the contradictory nature of the two schemes; for the same fountain
   does not yield both hot and cold. The law holds all living men under
   its curse; and from the law, therefore, it is in vain to expect a
   blessing. They are declared to be of the works of the law who place
   their trust for salvation in those works; for such modes of expression
   must always be interpreted by the state of the question. Now, we know
   that the controversy here relates to righteousness. All who wish to be
   justified by the works of the law are declared to be liable to the
   curse. But how does he prove this? The sentence of the law is, that all
   who have transgressed any part of the law are cursed. Let us now see if
   there be any living man who fulfils the law. But no such person, it is
   evident, has been, or ever can be found. All to a man are here
   condemned. The minor and the conclusion are wanting, for the entire
   syllogism would run thus: "Whoever has come short in any part of the
   law is cursed; all are held chargeable with this guilt; therefore all
   are cursed." This argument of Paul would not stand, if we had
   sufficient strength to fulfill the law; for there would then be a fatal
   objection to the minor proposition. Either Paul reasons badly, or it is
   impossible for men to fulfill the law.

   An antagonist might now object: "I admit that all transgressors are
   accursed; what then? Men will be found who keep the law; for they are
   free to choose good or evil." But Paul places here beyond controversy,
   what the Papists at this day hold to be a detestable doctrine, that men
   are destitute of strength to keep the law. And so he concludes boldly
   that all are cursed, because all have been commanded to keep the law
   perfectly; which implies that in the present corruption of our nature
   the power of keeping it perfectly is wanting. Hence we conclude that
   the curse which the law pronounces, though, in the phrase of logicians,
   it is accidental, is here perpetual and inseparable from its nature.
   The blessing which it offers to us is excluded by our depravity, so
   that the curse alone remains.

   11. But that no man, is justified by the law. He again argues from a
   comparison of contradictory schemes. "If we are justified by faith, it
   is not by the law: but we are justified by faith therefore it is not by
   the law." The minor is proved by a passage from Habakkuk, which is also
   quoted in the Epistle to the Romans. (Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 1:17.) The
   major is proved by the difference in the methods of justification. The
   law justifies him who fulfils all its precepts, while faith justifies
   those who are destitute of the merit of works, and who rely on Christ
   alone. To be justified by our own merit, and to be justified by the
   grace of another, are two schemes which cannot be reconciled: one of
   them must be overturned by the other. Such is the amount of the
   argument: let us now attend to the separate clauses.

   The just shall live by faith. As we had occasion to expound this
   passage where it occurs in the Epistle to the Romans, it will be
   unnecessary to repeat the exposition of it here. The prophet evidently
   describes a proud confidence in the flesh as contrasted with true
   faith. He declares, that "the just shall live;" by which he means, not
   that they are supported for a short period, and liable to be
   overwhelmed by an approaching storm; but that they shall continue to
   live, and that, even amidst the most imminent danger, their life shall
   be preserved. There is therefore no weight in the scornful reproaches
   of our adversaries, who allege that the prophet there employs the word
   Faith in a wider acceptation than Paul does in this passage. By Faith
   he evidently means the exercise of a calm, steady conscience, relying
   on God alone; so that Paul's quotation is properly applied.

   12. And the law is not of faith. The law evidently is not contrary to
   faith; otherwise God would be unlike himself; but we must return to a
   principle already noticed, that Paul's language is modified by the
   present aspect of the case. The contradiction between the law and faith
   lies in the matter of justification. You will more easily unite fire
   and water, than reconcile these two statements, that men are justified
   by faith, and that they are justified by the law. "The law is not of
   faith;" that is, it has a method of justifying a man which is wholly at
   variance with faith.

   But the man who shall do these things. The difference lies in this,
   that man, when he fulfils the law, is reckoned righteous by a legal
   righteousness, which he proves by a quotation from Moses. (Leviticus
   18:5.) Now, what is the righteousness of faith? He defines it in the
   Epistle to the Romans,

   "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
   in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,
   thou shalt be saved." (Romans 10:9.)

   And yet it does not follow from this, that faith is inactive, or that
   it sets believers free from good works. For the present question is
   not, whether believers ought to keep the law as far as they can, (which
   is beyond all doubt,) but whether they can obtain righteousness by
   works, which is impossible. But since God promises life to the doers of
   the law, why does Paul affirm that they are not righteous? The reply to
   this objection is easy. There are none righteous by the works of the
   law, because there are none who do those works. We admit that the doers
   of the law, if there were any such, are righteous; but since that is a
   conditional agreement, all are excluded from life, because no man
   performs that righteousness which he ought. We must bear in memory what
   I have already stated, that to do the law is not to obey it in part,
   but to fulfill everything which belongs to righteousness; and all are
   at the greatest distance from such perfection.

   13. Christ hath redeemed us. The apostle had made all who are under the
   law subject to the curse; from which arose this great difficulty, that
   the Jews could not free themselves from the curse of the law. Having
   stated this difficulty, he meets it, by shewing that Christ hath made
   us free, which still farther aids his purpose. If we are saved, because
   we have been freed from the curse of the law, then righteousness is not
   by the law. He next points out the manner in which we are made free.

   It is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree. Now, Christ
   hung upon the cross, therefore he fell under that curse. But it is
   certain that he did not suffer that punishment on his own account. It
   follows, therefore, either that he was crucified in vain, or that our
   curse was laid upon him, in order that we might be delivered from it.
   Now, he does not say that Christ was cursed, but, which is still more,
   that he was a curse, -- intimating, that the curse "of all men [59] was
   laid upon him" (Isaiah 53:6.) If any man think this language harsh, let
   him be ashamed of the cross of Christ, in the confession of which we
   glory. It was not unknown to God what death his own Son would die, when
   he pronounced the law, "He that is hanged is accursed of God."
   (Deuteronomy 21:23.)

   But how does it happen, it will be asked, that a beloved Son is cursed
   by his Father? We reply, there are two things which must be considered,
   not only in the person of Christ, but even in his human nature. The one
   is, that he was the unspotted Lamb of God, full of blessing and of
   grace; the other is, that he placed himself in our room, and thus
   became a sinner, and subject to the curse, not in himself indeed, but
   in us, yet in such a manner, that it became necessary for him to occupy
   our place. He could not cease to be the object of his Father's love,
   and yet he endured his wrath. For how could he reconcile the Father to
   us, if he had incurred his hatred and displeasure? We conclude, that he
   "did always those things that pleased" (John 8:29) his Father. Again,
   how would he have freed us from the wrath of God, if he had not
   transferred it from us to himself? Thus, "he was wounded for our
   transgressions," (Isaiah 53:5,) and had to deal with God as an angry
   judge. This is the foolishness of the cross, (1 Corinthians 1:18,) and
   the admiration of angels, (1 Peter 1:12,) which not only exceeds, but
   swallows up, all the wisdom of the world.

   14. That the blessing of Abraham. Having said that "Christ hath
   redeemed us from the curse of the law" he now applies that statement
   more closely to his purpose. The promised blessing of Abraham is
   founded on this, and flows from it to the Gentiles. If the Jews must be
   delivered from the law, in order to become the heirs of Abraham, what
   shall hinder the Gentiles from obtaining the same benefit? And if that
   blessing is found in Christ alone, it is faith in Christ which alone
   brings it into our possession.

   The promise of the Spirit appears to me to mean, agreeably to a Hebrew
   idiom, a spiritual promise. Although that promise relates to the New
   Testament, "I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh," (Joel 2:28,)
   yet, in this passage, Paul refers to another subject. The spirit is
   here contrasted with all outward things, not with ceremonies merely,
   but with lineal descent, so as to leave no room for diversity of rank.
   From the nature of the promise, he proves that Jews differ nothing from
   Gentiles; because, if it is spiritual, it is received by faith alone.

   Galatians 3:15-18

   15. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's
   covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth
   thereto.

   15. Fratres, (secundum hominem dico) Hominis licet pactum, tamen si sit
   comprobatum, nemo rejicit aut addit aliquid.

   16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
   And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
   Christ.

   16. Porro Abrahae dictae sunt promissiones, et semini ejus. Non dicit,
   Et seminibus, tanquam Deuteronomy multis, sed tanquam Deuteronomy uno,
   Et semini tuo, qui est Christus.

   17. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God
   in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
   cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

   17. Hoc autem dico: pactum ante comprobatum a Deo erga Christum, Lex,
   quae post annos quadringentos et triginta coepit, non facit irritum, ut
   abroget Promissionem.

   18. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but
   God gave it to Abraham by promise.

   18. Nam si ex Lege haereditas, non jam ex Promissione; atqui Abrahae
   per Promissionem donavit Deus.


   15. I speak after the manner of men. By this expression he intended to
   put them to the blush. It is highly disgraceful and base that the
   testimony of God should have less weight with us than that of a mortal
   man. In demanding that the sacred covenant of God shall receive not
   less deference than is commonly yielded to ordinary human transactions,
   he does not place God on a level with men. The immense distance between
   God and men is still left for their consideration.

   Though it be but a man's covenant. This is an argument from the less to
   the greater. Human contracts are admitted on all hands to be binding:
   how much more what God has established? The Greek word diatheke, here
   used, signifies more frequently, what the Latin versions here render
   it, (testamentum,) a testament; but sometimes too, a covenant, though
   in this latter sense the plural number is more generally employed. It
   is of little importance to the present passage, whether you explain it
   covenant or testament. The case is different with the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, where the apostle unquestionably alludes to testaments,
   (Hebrews 9:16, 17;) but here I prefer to take it simply for the
   covenant which God made. The analogy from which the apostle argues,
   would not apply so strictly to a testament as to a covenant. The
   apostle appears to reason from human bargains to that solemn covenant
   into which God entered with Abraham. If human bargains be so firm that
   they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant remain
   inviolable?

   16. Now to Abraham, and his seed. Before pursuing his argument, he
   introduces an observation about the substance of the covenant, that it
   rests on Christ alone. But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain,
   it follows that it is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the
   word promise. As the law has respect to men and to their works, so the
   promise has respect to the grace of God and to faith.

   He saith not, And to seeds. To prove that in this place God speaks of
   Christ, he calls attention to the singular number as denoting some
   particular seed. I have often been astonished that Christians, when
   they saw this passage so perversely tortured by the Jews, did not make
   a more determined resistance; for all pass it slightly as if it were an
   indisputed territory. And yet there is much plausibility in their
   objection. Since the word seed is a collective noun, Paul appears to
   reason inconclusively, when he contends that a single individual is
   denoted by this word, under which all the descendants of Abraham are
   comprehended in a passage already quoted, "In multiplying I will
   multiply thy seed, zr (zerang,) or zrk (zargnacha,) as the stars of the
   heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore." (Genesis 22:17.)
   Having, as they imagine, detected the fallacy of the argument, they
   treat us with haughty triumph.

   I am the more surprised that our own writers should have been silent on
   this head, as we have abundant means of repelling their slander. Among
   Abraham's own sons a division began, for one of the sons was cut off
   from the family. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." (Genesis 21:12.)
   Consequently Ishmael is not included in the reckoning. Let us come a
   step lower. Do the Jews allow that the posterity of Esau are the
   blessed seed? nay, it will be maintained that their father, though the
   first-born, was struck off. And how many nations have sprung from the
   stock of Abraham who have no share in this "calling?" The twelve
   patriarchs, at length, formed twelve heads, not because they were
   descended from the line of Abraham, but because they had been appointed
   by a particular election of God. Since the ten tribes were carried
   away, (Hosa 9:17,) how many thousands have so degenerated that they no
   longer hold a name among the seed of Abraham? Lastly, a trial was made
   of the tribe of Judah, that the real succession to the blessing might
   be transmitted among a small people. And this had been predicted by
   Isaiah,

   "Though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,
   yet a remnant of them shall return." (Isaiah 10:22.)

   Hitherto I have said nothing which the Jews themselves do not
   acknowledge. Let them answer me then; how comes it that the thirteen
   tribes sprung from the twelve patriarchs were the seed of Abraham, in
   preference to Ishmaelites and Edomites? Why do they exclusively glory
   in that name, and set aside the others as a spurious seed? They will,
   no doubt, boast that they have obtained it by their own merit; but
   Scripture, on the contrary, asserts that all depends on the calling of
   God; for we must constantly return to the privilege conveyed in these
   words, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." (Genesis 21:12.) The
   uninterrupted succession to this privilege must have been in force
   until Christ; for, in the person of David, the Lord afterwards brought
   back by recovery, as we might say, the promise which had been made to
   Abraham. In proving, therefore, that this prediction applies to a
   single individual, Paul does not make his argument rest on the use of
   the singular number. He merely shews that the word seed must denote one
   who was not only descended from Abraham according to the flesh, but had
   been likewise appointed for this purpose by the calling of God. If the
   Jews deny this, they will only make themselves ridiculous by their
   obstinacy.

   But as Paul likewise argues from these words, that a covenant had been
   made in Christ, or to Christ, let us inquire into the force of that
   expression,

   "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
   (Genesis 22:18.)

   The Jews taunt the apostle with making a comparison, as if the seed of
   Abraham were to be quoted as an example in all disastrous omens and
   prayers; while, on the contrary, to curse in Sodom or Israel is to
   employ the name of Sodom or Israel in forms of cursing. This, I own, is
   sometimes the case, but not always; for to bless one's self in God has
   quite a different meaning, as the Jews themselves admit. Since,
   therefore, the phrase is ambiguous, denoting sometimes a cause and
   sometimes a comparison, wherever, it occurs, it must be explained by
   the context. We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by
   nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all
   nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not, but those
   only who are "gathered" (Isaiah 66:8) to the Messiah; for when, under
   His government and direction, they are collected into one body, they
   then become one people. Whoever then, laying disputing aside, shall
   inquire into the truth, will readily acknowledge that the words here
   signify not a mere comparison but a cause; and hence it follows that
   Paul had good ground for saying, that the covenant was made in Christ,
   or in reference to Christ.

   17. The law which was four hundred and thirty years after. If we listen
   to Origen and Jerome and all the Papists, there will be little
   difficulty in refuting this argument. Paul reasons thus: "A promise was
   given to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before the publication
   of the law; therefore the law which came after could not disannul the
   promise; and hence he concludes that ceremonies are not necessary." But
   it may be objected, the sacraments were given in order to preserve the
   faith, and why should Paul separate them from the promise? He does so
   separate them, and proceeds to argue on the matter. The ceremonies
   themselves are not so much considered by him as something higher, --
   the effect of justification which was attributed to them by false
   apostles, and the obligation on the conscience. From ceremonies,
   accordingly, he takes occasion to discuss the whole subject of faith
   and works. If the point in dispute had no connection with obtaining
   righteousness, with the merit of works, or with ensnaring the
   conscience, ceremonies would be quite consistent with the promise.

   What, then, is meant by this disannulling of the promise, against which
   the apostle contends? The impostors denied that salvation is freely
   promised to men, and received by faith, and, as we shall presently see,
   urged the necessity of works in order to merit salvation. I return to
   Paul's own language. "The law," he says, "is later than the promise,
   and therefore does not revoke it; for a covenant once sanctioned must
   remain perpetually binding." I again repeat, if you do not understand
   that the promise is free, there will be no force in the statement; for
   the law and the promise are not at variance but on this single point,
   that the law justifies a man by the merit of works, and the promise
   bestows righteousness freely. This is made abundantly clear when he
   calls it a covenant founded on Christ.

   But here we shall have the Papists to oppose us, for they will find a
   ready method of evading this argument. "We do not require," they will
   say, "that the old ceremonies shall be any longer binding; let them be
   laid out of the question; nevertheless a man is justified by the moral
   law. For this law, which is as old as the creation of man, went before
   God's covenant with Abraham; so that Paul's reasoning is either
   frivolous, or it holds against ceremonies alone." I answer, Paul took
   into account what was certainly true, that, except by a covenant with
   God, no reward is due to works. Admitting, then, that the law
   justifies, yet before the law men could not merit salvation by works,
   because there was no covenant. All that I am now affirming is granted
   by the scholastic theologians: for they maintain that works are
   meritorious of salvation, not by their intrinsic worth, but by the
   acceptance of God, (to use their own phrase,) and on the ground of a
   covenant. Consequently, where no divine covenant, no declaration of
   acceptance is found, -- no works will be available for justification:
   so that Paul's argument is perfectly conclusive. He tells us that God
   made two covenants with men; one through Abraham, and another through
   Moses. The former, being founded on Christ, was free; and therefore the
   law, which came after, could not enable men to obtain salvation
   otherwise than by grace, for then, "it would make the promise of none
   effect." That this is the meaning appears clearly from what immediately
   follows.

   18. If the inheritance be of the law. His opponents might still reply,
   that nothing was farther from their intention than to weaken or
   disannul God's covenant. To deprive them of every kind of subterfuge,
   he comes forward with the assertion, that salvation by the law, and
   salvation by the promise of God, are wholly inconsistent with each
   other. Who will dare to explain this as applying to ceremonies alone,
   while Paul comprehends under it whatever interferes with a free
   promise? Beyond all doubt, he excludes works of every description.
   "For," says he to the Romans,

   "if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
   and the promise made of none effect." (Romans 4:14.)

   Why so? Because salvation would be suspended on the condition of
   satisfying the law; and so he immediately concludes:

   "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, in order that the
   promise might be sure to all the seed." (Romans 4:16.)

   Let us carefully remember the reason why, in comparing the promise with
   the law, the establishment of the one overturns the other. The reason
   is, that the promise has respect to faith, and the law to works. Faith
   receives what is freely given, but to works a reward is paid. And he
   immediately adds, God gave it to Abraham, not by requiring some sort of
   compensation on his part, but by free promise; for if you view it as
   conditional, the word gave, (kecharistai,) would be utterly
   inapplicable.

   Galatians 3:19-22

   19. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
   transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made;
   and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

   19. Quid igitur Lex? transgressionum causa adjuneta fuit, donee veniret
   semen, cui promissum fuerat, ordinata per angelos in manu mediatoris.

   20. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

   20. Porro mediator unius non est; Deus autem unus est.

   21. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if
   there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
   righteousness should have been by the law.

   21. Lexne igitur adversus promissiones Dei? absit; nam si data esset
   Lex, quae posset vivificare, vere ex Lege esset justitia.

   22. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by
   faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

   22. Sed conclusit Scriptura omnia sub peccatum, ut promissio ex fide
   Iesu Christi daretur credentibus.


   When we are told that the law has no influence in obtaining
   justification, various suggestions immediately arise, that it must be
   either useless, or opposed to God's covenant, or something of that
   sort. Nay, it might occur, why should we not say of the law, what
   Jeremiah says of the New Testament, (Jeremiah 31:31,) that it was given
   at a later period, in order to supply the weakness of the former
   doctrine? Objections of this kind must be answered, if Paul wished to
   satisfy the Galatians. First, then, he inquires, -- what is the use of
   the law? Having come after the promise, it appears to have been
   intended to supply its defects; and there was room at least for
   doubting, whether the promise would have been effectual, if it had not
   been aided by the law. Let it be observed, that Paul does not speak of
   the moral law only, but of everything connected with the office held by
   Moses. That office, which was peculiar to Moses, consisted in laying
   down a rule of life and ceremonies to be observed in the worship of
   God, and in afterwards adding promises and threatenings. Many promises,
   no doubt, relating to the free mercy of God and to Christ, are to be
   found in his writings; and these promises belong to faith. But this
   must be viewed as accidental, and altogether foreign to the inquiry, so
   far as a comparison is made between the law and the doctrine of grace.
   Let it be remembered, that the amount of the question is this: When a
   promise had been made, why did Moses afterwards add that new condition,
   "If a man do, he shall live in them;" and, "Cursed be he that
   confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them?" (Leviticus 18:5;
   Deuteronomy 27:26.) Was it to produce something better and more
   perfect?

   19. Because of transgressions. The law has manifold uses, but Paul
   confines himself to that which bears on his present subject. He did not
   propose to inquire in how many ways the law is of advantage to men. It
   is necessary to put readers on their guard on this point; for very
   many, I find, have fallen into the mistake of acknowledging no other
   advantage belonging to the law, but what is expressed in this passage.
   Paul himself elsewhere speaks of the precepts of the law as profitable
   for doctrine and exhortations. (2 Timothy 3:16.) The definition here
   given of the use of the law is not complete, and those who refuse to
   make any other acknowledgment in favor of the law do wrong. Now, what
   is the import of the phrase, because of transgressions? It agrees with
   the saying of philosophers, that "The law was made for restraining
   evil-doers," and with the old proverb, "From bad manners have sprung
   good laws." But Paul's meaning is more extensive than the words may
   seem to convey. He means that the law was published in order to make
   known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge
   their guilt. As men naturally are too ready to excuse themselves, so,
   until they are roused by the law, their consciences are asleep.

   "Until the law," says Paul, "sin was in the world:
   but sin is not imputed where there is no law." (Romans 5:13.)

   The law came and roused the sleepers, for this is the true preparation
   for Christ. "By the law is the knowledge of sin." (Romans 3:20.) Why?

   "That Sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful." (Romans
   7:13.)

   Thus, "the law was added because of transgressions," in order to reveal
   their true character, or, as he tells the Romans, that it might make
   them to abound. (Romans 5:20.)

   This passage has tortured the ingenuity of Origen, but to no purpose.
   If God summon consciences to his tribunal, that those qualities in
   their transgression, which would otherwise give them pleasure, may
   humble them by a conviction of guilt, -- if he shake off the
   listlessness which overwhelmed all dread of his judgment-seat, -- if he
   drag to light; sin, which lurked like a thief in the den of hypocrisy,
   -- what is there in all this that can be reckoned absurd? But it may be
   objected: "As the law is the rule of a devout and holy life, why is it
   said to be added because of transgressions,' rather than because of
   obedience?'" I answer, however much it may point out true
   righteousness, yet, owing to the corruption of our nature, its
   instruction tends only to increase transgressions, until the Spirit of
   regeneration come, who writes it on the heart; and that Spirit is not
   given by the law, but is received by faith. This saying of Paul, let
   the reader remember, is not of a philosophical or political character,
   but expresses a purpose of the law, with which the world had been
   always unacquainted.

   Till the seed should come. If it has respect to seed, it must be to
   that on which the blessing has been pronounced, and therefore it does
   not interfere with the promise. The word till, (achris hou,) signifies
   so long as the seed is expected: and hence it follows, that it must
   have been intended to occupy not the highest, but a subordinate rank.
   It was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ. But
   was it necessary that it should last only until the coming of Christ?
   For if so, it follows that it is now abolished. The whole of that
   administration, I reply, was temporal, and was given for the purpose of
   preserving among the ancient people an attachment to the faith of
   Christ. And yet I do not admit that, by the coming of Christ, the whole
   law was abolished. The apostle did not intend this, but merely that the
   mode of administration, which for a time had been introduced, must
   receive its accomplishment in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the
   promise. [60] But on this subject we shall have occasion to speak more
   fully afterwards.

   Ordained by angels. The circumstance, that it was delivered through
   angels, tends to the commendation of the law. This is declared by
   Stephen (Acts 7:53) also, who says, that they had "received the law,
   (eis diatagas angelon,) into the dispositions of angels." The
   interpretation given by some, that Moses and Aaron, and the priests,
   are the angels here meant, is more ingenious than solid. Nor is it
   wonderful that angels, by whom God bestows on us some of the smallest
   of his blessings, should have been intrusted also with this office of
   attending as witnesses at the promulgation of the law.

   In the hand of a Mediator Hand usually signifies ministration; but as
   angels were ministers in giving the law, I consider "the hand of the
   Mediator" to denote the highest rank of service. The Mediator was at
   the head of the embassy, and angels were united with him as his
   companions. Some apply this expression to Moses, as marking a
   comparison between Moses and Christ; but I agree rather with the
   ancient expositors, who apply it to Christ himself. [61] This view, it
   will be found, agrees better with the context, though I differ from the
   ancients likewise as to the meaning of the word. Mediator does not, as
   they imagine, signify here one who makes reconciliation, which it does
   in these words,

   "There is one Mediator between God and men,
   the man Christ Jesus," (1 Timothy 2:5,)

   -- but an ambassador employed in promulgating a law.

   We are thus to understand, that, since the beginning of the world, God
   has held no intercourse with men, but through the agency of his eternal
   Wisdom or Son. Hence Peter says, that the holy prophets spake by the
   "Spirit of Christ," (1 Peter 1:11,) and Paul makes him the leader of
   the people in the wilderness. (1 Corinthians 10:4.) And certainly the
   Angel who appeared to Moses, (Exodus 3:2,) can be no other person; for
   he claims to himself the peculiar and essential name of God, which is
   never applied to creatures. As he is the Mediator of reconciliation, by
   whom we are accepted of God, -- the Mediator of intercession, who opens
   up for us a way to "call on the Father," (1 Peter 1:17,) -- so he has
   always been the Mediator of all doctrine, because by him God has always
   revealed himself to men. And this he intended to state expressly, for
   the purpose of informing the Galatians, that he who is the foundation
   of the covenant of grace, held also the highest rank in the giving of
   the law.

   20. Now, a mediator is not a mediator of one. Some are disposed to
   philosophize on this expression, and would make Paul's meaning to be,
   that the twofold nature of Christ is not one in essence. But that Paul
   is here speaking of the contracting parties, no man of sound judgment
   entertains a doubt. And so they commonly expound it, that there is no
   room for a Mediator, unless when one of the parties has a matter to
   transact with the other. But why that statement should have been
   introduced they leave undetermined, though the passage manifestly
   deserves the most careful attention. There may, perhaps, be an
   Anticipation (prolepsis) of some wicked thought that might arise about
   a change of the divine purpose. Some one might say, "As men, when they
   change their mind about their covenants, are wont to retract them, so
   has it happened with the covenants of God." If you take this to be the
   meaning, then, in the former clause, Paul would acknowledge that men,
   who occupy one side of this contract, are unsteady and changeable,
   while God nevertheless remains the same, is consistent with himself,
   and partakes not of the unsteadiness of men.

   But when I take a closer view of the whole subject, I rather think that
   it marks a difference between Jews and Gentiles. Christ is not the
   Mediator of one, because, in respect of outward character, there is a
   diversity of condition among those with whom, through his mediation,
   God enters into covenant. But Paul asserts that we have no right to
   judge in this manner of the covenant of God, as if it contradicted
   itself, or varied according to the diversities of men. The words are
   now clear. As Christ formerly reconciled God to the Jews in making a
   covenant, so now he is the Mediator of the Gentiles. The Jews differ
   widely from the Gentiles; for circumcision and ceremonies have erected
   "the middle wall of partition between them." (Ephesians 2:14.) They
   were "nigh" to God, (Ephesians 2:13,) while the Gentiles were "afar
   off;" but still God is consistent with himself. This becomes evident,
   when Christ brings those who formerly differed among themselves to one
   God, and makes them unite in one body. God is one, because he always
   continues to be like himself, and, with unvarying regularity, holds
   fixed and unalterable the purpose which he has once made. [62]

   21. Is the law then against the promises of God? The certainty and
   steadiness of the divine purpose being admitted, we are bound equally
   to conclude that its results are not contrary to each other. Still
   there was a difficulty to be resolved, arising from the apparent
   contradiction between the Law and the covenant of grace. This is,
   perhaps, an exclamation. Dreading no farther contradiction, now that
   the point is settled, Paul concludes, that the former arguments have
   placed it beyond a doubt, and exclaims: "Who will now dare to imagine a
   disagreement between the law and the promises?" And yet this does not
   prevent Paul from proceeding to remove the difficulties that might
   still arise.

   Before answering the question, he expresses, in his usual manner, a
   high disdain of such folly; thus intimating the strong abhorrence with
   which pious men must regard whatever brings reproach on the Divine
   character. But another instance of high address, which claims our
   notice, is found in this turn of expression. He charges his adversaries
   with the offense of making God contradict himself. For from him the Law
   and the promises have evidently proceeded: whoever then alleges any
   contradiction between them blasphemes against God: but they do
   contradict each other, if the Law justifies. Thus does Paul most
   dexterously retort upon his adversaries the charge which they falsely
   and calumniously brought against him.

   For if there had been a law given. The reply is (what is called)
   indirect, and does not plainly assert an agreement between the law and
   the promises, but contains all that is necessary to remove the
   contradiction. At first sight, you would say that this sentence departs
   from the context, and has nothing to do with the solution of the
   question; but this is not the case. The law would be opposed to the
   promises, if it had the power of justifying; for there would be two
   opposite methods of justifying a man, two separate roads towards the
   attainment of righteousness. But Paul refuses to the law such a power;
   so that the contradiction is removed. I would admit, says he, that
   righteousness is obtained by the law, if salvation were found in it.
   But what?

   22. The Scripture hath concluded. By the word Scripture is chiefly
   intended the law itself. It "hath concluded all under sin," and
   therefore, instead of giving, it takes away righteousness from all. The
   reasoning is most powerful. "You seek righteousness in the law: but the
   law itself, with the whole of Scripture, leaves nothing to men but
   condemnation; for all men, with their works, are pronounced to be
   unrighteous: who then shall live by the law?" He alludes to these
   words,

   "He who shall do these things, shall live in them." (Leviticus 18:5.)

   Shut out by it, says he, from life through guilt, in vain should we
   seek salvation by the law. -- The word translated all (ta panta)
   signifies all things, and conveys more than if he had said all men; for
   it embraces not only men, but every thing which they possess or can
   accomplish.

   That the promise by faith. There is no remedy but to throw away the
   righteousness of works, and betake ourselves to the faith of Christ.
   The result is certain. If works come into judgment, we are all
   condemned; therefore we obtain, by the faith of Christ, a free
   righteousness. This sentence is full of the highest consolation. It
   tells us that, wherever we hear ourselves condemned in Scripture, there
   is help provided for us in Christ, if we betake ourselves to him. We
   are lost, though God were silent: why then does he so often pronounce
   that we are lost? It is that we may not perish by everlasting
   destruction, but, struck and confounded by such a dreadful sentence,
   may by faith seek Christ, through whom we "pass from death into life."
   (1 John 3:14.) By a figure of speech, (metonumia,) in which the thing
   containing is put for the thing contained, the promise denotes that
   which is promised.

   perfect accomplishment of the promise."

   [61] "Though some learned men have been of opinion that the mediator
   here mentioned is the Son of God, yet I think no reasonable doubt can
   be entertained as to its denoting Moses. Strictly speaking, Aaron, or
   rather the priesthood, was the mediator of the old covenant. It answers
   to the Great High-Priest, (archiereus,) Mediator, (mesites,) and
   Surety, (enguos,) of the new covenant. But the reference seems here to
   the giving of the law: that was by Moses. The law was given by Moses.'
   (John 1:17.) God speaks to Moses, and Moses speaks to the people; and
   this arrangement was entered into by the express request of the people
   themselves. Moses himself says, I stood between the Lord and you at
   that time. (Deuteronomy 5:5.) Philo calls Moses mesites." -- Brown.

   [62] "This is confessedly one of the most obscure passages in the New

   are no less than 250 modes of explanation, most of which are stated and
   reviewed by Koppe, Berger, Keil, Bonitz, Weigand, and Scheft." --
   (Bloomfield.) Schott remarks, that the bare fact of upwards of 250
   interpretations makes it impossible to deny that some obscurity
   attaches to the Apostle's language in this passage, arising chiefly
   from mere brevity of style, but judiciously adds, that, had there not
   been many commentators more eager to bring forward anything that has
   the appearance of novelty, than to investigate the ordinary meaning of
   the terms, the scope of the passage, and the doctrinal statements and
   reasonings contained in the writings of the Apostle Paul, the
   interpretations would never have swelled to so large an amount. -- Ed.

   Galatians 3:23-29

   23. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the
   faith which should afterwards be revealed.

   23. Antequam autem veniret fides, sub Lege custodiebamur, conclusi sub
   fidem, quae revelanda erat.

   24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
   that we might be justified by faith.

   24. Itaque Lex paedagogus noster fuit in Christum, ut ex fide
   justificaremur.

   25. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
   schoolmaster.

   25. Adveniente autem fide, non amplius sub paedagogo sumus.

   26. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

   26. Nam omnes filii Dei estis per fidem in Christo Iesu.

   27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ.

   27. Siquidem quicunque in Christum baptizati estis, Christum induistis.

   28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
   there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

   28. Non est Iudaeus neque Graecus, non est servus neque liber, non est
   masculus neque femina; onmes enim vos unus estis in Christo Iesu.

   29. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
   according to the promise.

   29. Si autem vos Christi, ergo semen Abrahae estis, et secundum
   promissionem haeredes.


   23. Before faith came. The question proposed is now more fully defined.
   He explains at great length the use of the law, and the reason why it
   was temporal; for otherwise it would have appeared to be always
   unreasonable that a law should be delivered to the Jews, from which the
   Gentiles were excluded. If there be but one church consisting of Jews
   and Gentiles, why is there a diversity in its government? Whence is
   this new liberty derived, and on what authority does it rest, since the
   fathers were under subjection to the law? He therefore informs us, that
   the distinction is such as not to interrupt the union and harmony of
   the church.

   We must again remind the reader that Paul does not treat exclusively of
   ceremonies, or of the moral law, but embraces the whole economy by
   which the Lord governed his people under the Old Testament. It became a
   subject of dispute whether the form of government instituted by Moses
   had any influence in obtaining righteousness. Paul compares this law
   first to a prison, and next to a schoolmaster. Such was the nature of
   the law, as both comparisons plainly show, that it could not have been
   in force beyond a certain time.

   Faith denotes the full revelation of those things which, during the
   darkness of the shadows of the law, were dimly seen; for he does not
   intend to say that the fathers, who lived under the law, did not
   possess faith. The faith of Abraham has already come under our notice,
   and other instances are quoted by the author of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews. (Hebrews 11.) The doctrine of faith, in short, is attested by
   Moses and all the prophets: but, as faith was not then clearly
   manifested, so the time of faith is an appellation here given, not in
   an absolute, but in a comparative sense, to the time of the New
   Testament. That this was his meaning is evident from what he
   immediately adds, that they were shut up under the faith which should
   afterwards be revealed; for this implies that those who were under the
   custody of the law were partakers of the same faith. The law did not
   restrain them from faith; but, that they might not wander from the fold
   of faith, it kept possession of themselves. There is an elegant
   allusion, too, to what he had formerly said, that "the scripture hath
   concluded all under sin." They were besieged on every hand by the
   curse, but this siege was counteracted by an imprisonment which
   protected them from the curse; so that the imprisonment by the law is
   here proved to have been highly generous in its character.

   Faith was not yet revealed, not because the fathers wanted light, but
   because they had less light than we have. The ceremonies might be said
   to shadow out an absent Christ, but to us he is represented as actually
   present, and thus while they had the mirror, we have the substance.
   Whatever might be the amount of darkness under the law, the fathers
   were not ignorant of the road in which they ought to walk. Though the
   dawn is not equal to the splendor of noon, yet, as it is sufficient to
   direct a journey, travelers do not wait till the sun is fully risen.
   Their portion of light resembled the dawn, which was enough to preserve
   them from all error, and guide them to everlasting blessedness.

   24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster This is the second
   comparison, which still more clearly expresses Paul's design. A
   schoolmaster is not appointed for the whole life, but only for
   childhood, as the etymology of the Greek word paidagogos implies. [63]
   Besides, in training a child, the object is to prepare him, by the
   instructions of childhood, for maturer years. The comparison applies in
   both respects to the law, for its authority was limited to a particular
   age, and its whole object was to prepare its scholars in such a manner,
   that, when its elementary instructions were closed, they might make
   progress worthy of manhood. And so he adds, that it was our
   schoolmaster (eis Christon) unto Christ. The grammarian, when he has
   trained a boy, delivers him into the hands of another, who conducts him
   through the higher branches of a finished education. In like manner,
   the law was the grammar of theology, which, after carrying its scholars
   a short way, handed them over to faith to be completed. Thus, Paul
   compares the Jews to children, and us to advanced youth.

   But a question arises, what was the instruction or education of this
   schoolmaster? First, the law, by displaying the justice of God,
   convinced them that in themselves they were unrighteous; for in the
   commandments of God, as in a mirror, they might see how far they were
   distant from true righteousness. They were thus reminded that
   righteousness must be sought in some other quarter. The promises of the
   law served the same purpose, and might lead to such reflections as
   these: "If you cannot obtain life by works but by fulfilling the law,
   some new and different method must be sought. Your weakness will never
   allow you to ascend so high; nay, though you desire and strive ever so
   much, you will fall far short of the object." The threatenings, on the
   other hand, pressed and entreated them to seek refuge from the wrath
   and curse of God, and gave them no rest till they were constrained to
   seek the grace of Christ.

   Such too, was the tendency of all the ceremonies; for what end did
   sacrifices and washings serve but to keep the mind continually fixed on
   pollution and condemnation? When a man's uncleanness is placed before
   his eyes, when the unoffending animal is held forth as the image of his
   own death, how can he indulge in sleep? How can he but be roused to the
   earnest cry for deliverance? Beyond all doubt, ceremonies accomplished
   their object, not merely by alarming and humbling the conscience, but
   by exciting them to the faith of the coming Redeemer. In the imposing
   services of the Mosaic ritual, every thing that was presented to the
   eye bore an impress of Christ. The law, in short, was nothing else than
   an immense variety of exercises, in which the worshippers were led by
   the hand to Christ.

   That we might be justified by faith. He has already said that the law
   is not perfect, when he compared it to the training of childhood; but
   it would make men perfect if it bestowed upon them righteousness. What
   remains but that faith shall take its place? And so it does, when we,
   who are destitute of a righteousness of our own, are clothed by it with
   the righteousness of Christ. Thus is the saying accomplished, "he hath
   filled the hungry with good things." (Luke 1:53.)

   25. But after that faith is come. This phrase has been already
   considered. It denotes the brighter revelation of grace after that "the
   vail of the temple was rent in twain," (Matthew 27:51,) which, we know,
   was effected by the manifestation of Christ. He affirms that, under the
   reign of Christ, there is no longer any childhood which needs to be
   placed under a schoolmaster, and that, consequently, the law has
   resigned its office, -- which is another application of the comparison.
   There were two things which he had undertaken to prove, -- that the law
   is a preparation for Christ, and that it is temporal. But here the
   question is again put, Is the law so abolished that we have nothing to
   do with it? I answer, the law, so far as it is a rule of life, a bridle
   to keep us in the fear of the Lord, a spur to correct the sluggishness
   of our flesh, -- so far, in short, as it is

   "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
   in righteousness, that believers may be instructed in every good work,"
   (2 Timothy 3:16, 17,)

   -- is as much in force as ever, and remains untouched.

   In what respect, then, is it abolished? Paul, we have said, looks at
   the law as possessing certain qualities, and those qualities we shall
   enumerate. It annexes to works a reward and a punishment; that is, it
   promises life to those who keep it, and curses all transgressors.
   Meanwhile, it requires from man the highest perfection and most exact
   obedience. It makes no abatement, gives no pardon, but calls to a
   severe reckoning the smallest offenses. It does not openly exhibit
   Christ and his grace, but points him out at a distance, and only when
   hidden by the covering of ceremonies. All such qualities of the law,
   Paul tells us, are abolished; so that the office of Moses is now at an
   end, so far as it differs in outward aspect from a covenant of grace.

   26. For ye are all the children of God. It would be unjust, and in the
   highest degree unreasonable, that the law should hold believers in
   perpetual slavery. This is proved by the additional argument, that they
   are the children of God. It would not be enough to say that we are no
   longer children, unless it were added that we are freemen; for in
   slaves age makes no alteration. The fact of their being the children of
   God proves their freedom. How? By faith in Christ Jesus; for

   "as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
   God, even to them that believe on his name."
   (John 1:12.)

   Since, then, by faith we have obtained adoption, by faith likewise we
   have obtained our freedom.

   27. As many of you as have been baptized. The greater and loftier the
   privilege is of being the children of God, the farther is it removed
   from our senses, and the more difficult to obtain belief. He therefore
   explains, in a few words, what is implied in our being united, or
   rather, made one with the Son of God; so as to remove all doubt, that
   what belongs to him is communicated to us. He employs the metaphor of a
   garment, when he says that the Galatians have put on Christ; but he
   means that they are so closely united to him, that, in the presence of
   God, they bear the name and character of Christ, and are viewed in him
   rather than in themselves. This metaphor or similitude, taken from
   garments, occurs frequently, and has been treated by us in other
   places.

   But the argument, that, because they have been baptized, they have put
   on Christ, appears weak; for how far is baptism from being efficacious
   in all? Is it reasonable that the grace of the Holy Spirit should be so
   closely linked to an external symbol? Does not the uniform doctrine of
   Scripture, as well as experience, appear to confute this statement? I
   answer, it is customary with Paul to treat of the sacraments in two
   points of view. When he is dealing with hypocrites, in whom the mere
   symbol awakens pride, he then proclaims loudly the emptiness and
   worthlessness of the outward symbol, and denounces, in strong terms,
   their foolish confidence. In such cases he contemplates not the
   ordinance of God, but the corruption of wicked men. When, on the other
   hand, he addresses believers, who make a proper use of the symbols, he
   then views them in connection with the truth -- which they represent.
   In this case, he makes no boast of any false splendor as belonging to
   the sacraments, but calls our attention to the actual fact represented
   by the outward ceremony. Thus, agreeably to the Divine appointment, the
   truth comes to be associated with the symbols.

   But perhaps some person will ask, Is it then possible that, through the
   fault of men, a sacrament shall cease to bear a figurative meaning? The
   reply is easy. Though wicked men may derive no advantage from the
   sacraments, they still retain undiminished their nature and force. The
   sacraments present, both to good and to bad men, the grace of God. No
   falsehood attaches to the promises which they exhibit of the grace of
   the Holy Spirit. Believers receive what is offered; and if wicked men,
   by rejecting it, render the offer unprofitable to themselves, their
   conduct cannot destroy the faithfulness of God, or the true meaning of
   the sacrament. [64] With strict propriety, then, does Paul, in
   addressing believers, say, that when they were baptized, they "put on
   Christ;" just as, in the Epistle to the Romans, he says,

   "that we have been planted together into his death,
   so as to be also partakers of his resurrection."
   (Romans 6:5.)

   In this way, the symbol and the Divine operation are kept distinct, and
   yet the meaning of the sacraments is manifest; so that they cannot be
   regarded as empty and trivial exhibitions; and we are reminded with
   what base ingratitude they are chargeable, who, by abusing the precious
   ordinances of God, not only render them unprofitable to themselves, but
   turn them to their own destruction!

   28. There is neither Jew nor Greek. The meaning is, that there is no
   distinction of persons here, and therefore it is of no consequence to
   what nation or condition any one may belong: nor is circumcision any
   more regarded than sex or civil rank. And why? Because Christ makes
   them all one. Whatever may have been their former differences, Christ
   alone is able to unite them all. Ye are one: the distinction is now
   removed. The apostle's object is to shew that the grace of adoption,
   and the hope of salvation, do not depend on the law, but are contained
   in Christ alone, who therefore is all. Greek is here put, as usual, for
   Gentile, and one department for the whole class.

   29. Then are ye Abraham's seed. This is not intended to convey the
   idea, that to be a child of Abraham is better than to be a member of
   Christ, -- but to repress the pride of the Jews, who gloried in their
   privilege, as if they alone were the people of God. They reckoned no
   distinction higher than to belong to the race of Abraham; and this very
   distinction he makes to be common to all who believe in Christ. The
   conclusion rests on this argument, that Christ is the blessed seed, in
   whom, as we have said, all the children of Abraham are united. He
   proves this by the universal offer of the inheritance to them all, from
   which it follows, that the promise includes them among the children. It
   deserves notice, that, wherever faith is mentioned, it is always his
   relation to the promise.

   CHAPTER 4

   Galatians 4:1-5

   1. Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
   nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

   1. Dico antem: quamdiu haeres puer est, nihil differt a servo, quum
   tamen sit dominus onmium;

   2. But is under tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the
   father.

   2. Sed sub tutoribus et curatorbus est, usque ad tempus a patre
   definitum.

   3. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
   elements of the world:

   3. Sic et nos quum essemus pueri, sub elementis mundi in servitute
   eramus.

   4. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
   made of a woman, made under the law,

   4. Quando autem venit plenitudo temporis, misit Deus Filium suum,
   facturn ex muliere, redactum sub Legem;

   5. To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
   adoption of sons.

   5. Ut eos, qui sub Lege erant, redimeter, ut adoptionem reciperemus.


   1. Now I say. Whoever made the division into chapters has improperly
   separated this paragraph from the preceding, as it is nothing else than
   the concluding section, (epexergasia,) in which Paul explains and
   illustrates the difference that exists between us and the ancient
   people. He does so by introducing a third comparison, drawn from the
   relation which a person under age bears to his tutor. The young man,
   though he is free, though he is lord of all his father's family, still
   resembles a slave; for he is under the government of tutors. [65] But
   the period of guardianship lasts only "until the time appointed by the
   father" after which he enjoys his freedom. In this respect the fathers
   under the Old Testament, being the sons of God, were free; but they
   were not in possession of freedom, while the law held the place of
   their tutor, and kept them under its yoke. That slavery of the law
   lasted as long as it pleased God, who put an end to it at the coming of
   Christ. Lawyers enumerate various methods by which the tutelage or
   guardianship is brought to a close; but of all these methods, the only
   one adapted to this comparison is that which Paul has selected, "the
   appointment of the father."

   Let us now examine the separate clauses. Some apply the comparison in a
   different manner to the case of any man whatever, whereas Paul is
   speaking of two nations. What they say, I acknowledge, is true; but it
   has nothing to do with the present passage. The elect, though they are
   the children of God from the womb, yet, until by faith they come to the
   possession of freedom, remain like slaves under the law; but, from the
   time that they have known Christ, they no longer require this kind of
   tutelage. Granting all this, I deny that Paul here treats of
   individuals, or draws a distinction between the time of unbelief and
   the calling by faith. The matters in dispute were these. Since the
   church of God is one, how comes it that our condition is different from
   that of the Israelites? Since we are free by faith, how comes it that
   they, who had faith in common with us, were not partakers with us of
   the same freedom? Since we are all equally the children of God, how
   comes it that we at this day are exempt from a yoke which they were
   forced to bear? On these points the controversy turned, and not on the
   manner in which the law reigns over each of us before we are freed by
   faith from its slavery. Let this point be first of all settled, that
   Paul here compares the Israelitish church, which existed under the Old
   Testament, with the Christian church, that thus we may perceive in what
   points we agree and in what we differ. This comparison furnishes most
   abundant and most profitable instruction.

   First, we learn from it that our hope at the present day, and that of
   the fathers under the Old Testament, have been directed to the same
   inheritance; for they were partakers of the same adoption. According to
   the dreams of some fanatics, and of Servetus among others, the fathers
   were divinely elected for the sole purpose of prefiguring to us a
   people of God. Paul, on the other hand, contends that they were elected
   in order to be together with us the children of God, and particularly
   attests that to them, not less than to us, belonged the spiritual
   blessing promised to Abraham.

   Secondly, we learn that, notwithstanding their outward slavery, their
   consciences were still free. The obligation to keep the law did not
   hinder Moses and Daniel, all the pious kings, priests, and prophets,
   and the whole company of believers, from being free in spirit. They
   bore the yoke of the law upon their shoulders, but with a free spirit
   they worshipped God. More particularly, having been instructed
   concerning the free pardon of sin, their consciences were delivered
   from the tyranny of sin and death. Hence we ought to conclude that they
   held the same doctrine, were joined with us in the true unity of faith,
   placed reliance on the one Mediator, called on God as their Father, and
   were led by the same Spirit. All this leads to the conclusion, that the
   difference between us and the ancient fathers lies in accidents, not in
   substance. In all the leading characters of the Testament or Covenant
   we agree: the ceremonies and form of government, in which we differ,
   are mere additions. Besides, that period was the infancy of the church;
   but now that Christ is come, the church has arrived at the estate of
   manhood.

   The meaning of Paul's words is clear, but has he not some appearance of
   contradicting himself? In the Epistle to the Ephesians he exhorts us to
   make daily progress

   "till we come to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the
   fullness of Christ." (Ephesians 4:13.)

   In the first Epistle to the Corinthians he says, (1 Corinthians 3:2,)

   "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not
   able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able;"

   and shortly after this he compares the Galatians to children.
   (Galatians 4:19) In those passages, I reply, the apostle speaks of
   particular men, and of their faith as individuals; but here he speaks
   generally of two bodies without regard to persons. This reply will
   assist us in resolving a much greater difficulty. When we look at the
   matchless faith of Abraham, and the vast intelligence of the holy
   prophets, with what effrontery shall we dare to talk of such men as our
   inferiors? Were not they rather the heroes, and we the children? To say
   nothing of ourselves, who among the Galatians would have been found
   equal to any of those men?

   But here, as I have already said, the apostle describes not particular
   persons, but the universal condition of both nations. Some men were
   endowed with extraordinary gifts; but they were few, and the whole body
   did not share with them. Besides, though they had been numerous, we
   must inquire not what they inwardly were, but what was that kind or
   government under which God had placed them; and that was manifestly a
   school, paidagogia, a system of instruction for children. And what are
   we now? God has broken those chains, governs his church in a more
   indulgent manner, and lays not upon us such severe restraint. At the
   same time, we may remark in passing, that whatever amount of knowledge
   they might attain partook of the nature of the period; for a dark cloud
   continually rested on the revelation which they enjoyed. And hence that
   saying of our Savior,

   "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: for I tell you
   that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye
   see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear,
   and have not heard them." (Luke 10: 23, 24.)

   We now understand in what respect we are preferred to those who were
   greatly our superiors; for the statements are not applied to persons,
   but relate entirely to the economy of the Divine administration.

   This passage will prove a most powerful battery for destroying the
   pageantry of ceremonies, which constitutes the entire splendor of the
   Papal system. For what else is it that dazzles the eyes of simple
   people, so as to lead them to regard the dominion of the Pope, if not
   with admiration, at least with some degree of reverence, but the
   magnificent army of ceremonies, rites, gesticulations, and equipage of
   every description, contrived for the express purpose of amazing the
   ignorant? From this passage it appears that they are false disguises,
   by which the true beauty of the church is impaired. I do not now speak
   of greater and more frightful corruptions, such as, that they hold them
   out for divine worship, imagine them to possess the power of meriting
   salvation, and enforce with more rigid severity the observation of
   those trifles than the whole law of God. I only advert to the specious
   pretext under which our modern contrivers apologize for such a
   multitude of abominations. What though they object that the ignorance
   of the multitude prevails to a greater extent than it formerly did
   among the Israelites, and that many assistances are therefore required?
   They will never be able in this way to prove that the people must be
   placed under the discipline or a school similar to what existed among
   the people of Israel; for I shall always meet them with the
   declaration, that the appointment of God is totally different.

   If they plead expediency, I ask, are they better judges of what is
   expedient than God himself? Let us entertain the firm conviction that
   the highest advantage, as well as the highest propriety, will be found
   in whatever God has determined. In aiding the ignorant, we must employ
   not those methods which the fancy of men may have been pleased to
   contrive, but those which had been fixed by God themself, who
   unquestionably has left out nothing that was fitted to assist their
   weakness. Let this shield suffice for repelling any objections: "God
   has judged otherwise, and his purpose supplies to us the place of all
   arguments; unless it be supposed that men are capable of devising
   better aids than those which God had provided, and which he afterwards
   threw aside as useless." Let it be carefully observed, Paul does not
   merely say that the yoke which had been laid upon the Jews is removed
   from us, but expressly lays down a distinction in the government which
   God has commanded to be observed. I acknowledge that we are now at
   liberty as to all outward matters, but only on the condition that the
   church shall not be burdened with a multitude of ceremonies, nor
   Christianity confounded with Judaism. The reason of this we shall
   afterwards consider in the proper place.

   3. Under the elements of the world. Elements may either mean,
   literally, outward and bodily things, or, metaphorically, rudiments. I
   prefer the latter interpretation. But why does he say that those things
   which had a spiritual signification were of the world? We did not, he
   says, enjoy the truth in a simple form, but involved in earthly
   figures; and consequently, what was outward must have been "of the
   world," though there was concealed under it a heavenly mystery.

   4. When the fullness of the time was come. He proceeds with the
   comparison which he had adduced, and applies to his purpose the
   expression which has already occurred, "the time appointed by the
   Father," -- but still shewing that the time which had been ordained by
   the providence of God was proper and seasonable. That season is the
   most fit, and that mode of acting is the most proper, which the
   providence of God directs. At what time it was expedient that the Son
   of God should be revealed to the world, it belonged to God alone to
   judge and determine. This consideration ought to restrain all
   curiosity. Let no man presume to be dissatisfied with the secret
   purpose of God, and raise a dispute why Christ did not appear sooner.
   If the reader desires more full information on this subject, he may
   consult what I have written on the conclusion of the Epistle to the
   Romans.

   God sent forth his Son. These few words contain much instruction. The
   Son, who was sent, must have existed before he was sent; and this
   proves his eternal Godhead. Christ therefore is the Son of God, sent
   from heaven. Yet this same person was made of a woman, because he
   assumed our nature, which shews that he has two natures. Some copies
   read natum instead of filium; but the latter reading is more generally
   followed, and, in my opinion, is preferable. But the language was also
   expressly intended to distinguish Christ from other men, as having been
   formed of the substance of his mother, and not by ordinary generation.
   In any other sense, it would have been trifling, and foreign to the
   subject. The word woman is here put generally for the female sex.

   Subjected under the law. The literal rendering is, Made under the law;
   but in my version I have preferred another word, which expresses more
   plainly the fact that he was placed in subjection to the law. Christ
   the Son of God, who might have claimed to be exempt from every kind of
   subjection, became subject to the law. Why? He did so in our room, that
   he might obtain freedom for us. A man who was free, by constituting
   himself a surety, redeems a slave: by putting on himself the chains, he
   takes them off from the other. So Christ chose to become liable to keep
   the law, that exemption from it might be obtained for us; otherwise it
   would have been to no purpose that he should come under the yoke of the
   law, for it certainly was not on his own account that he did so.

   To redeem them that were under the law [66] We must here observe, the
   exemption from the law which Christ has procured for us does not imply
   that we no longer owe any obedience to the doctrine of the law, and may
   do whatever we please; for the law is the everlasting rule of a good
   and holy life. But Paul speaks of the law with all its appendages. From
   subjection to that law we are redeemed, because it is no longer what it
   once was. "The vail being rent," (Matthew 27:51,) freedom is openly
   proclaimed, and this is what he immediately adds.

   5. That we might receive the adoption. The fathers, under the Old
   Testament, were certain of their adoption, but did not so fully as yet
   enjoy their privilege. Adoption, like the phrase, "the redemption of
   our body," (Romans 8:23,) is here put for actual possession. As, at the
   last day, we receive the fruit of our redemption, so now we receive the
   fruit of adoption, of which the holy fathers did not partake before the
   coming of Christ; and therefore those who now burden the church with an
   excess of ceremonies, defraud her of the just right of adoption.

   Galatians 4:6-11

   6. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
   into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

   6. Quoniam autem estis filii, misit Deus Spiritum Filii sui in corda
   vestra, clamantem, Abba, Pater.

   7. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then
   an heir of God through Christ.

   7. Itaque non amplius es servus, sed filius; si antem filius, etiam
   haeres Dei per Christum.

   8. Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
   by nature are no gods.

   8. At tunc quum nondum cognoveratis Deum, serviebatis eis qui natura
   non sunt dii.

   9. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
   how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
   desire again to be in bondage?

   9. Nunc autem postquam cognovistis Deum, vel potius cogniti fuistis a
   Deo; quomode convertimini rursus ad infirma et egena elementa, quibus
   rursus Deuteronomy integro servire vultis?

   10. Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

   10. Dies observatis, et menses, et tempera, et annos.

   11. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

   11. Timeo Deuteronomy vobis, ne forte in vobis frustra laboraverim.


   6. And because ye are sons. The adoption which he had mentioned, is
   proved to belong to the Galatians by the following argument. This
   adoption must have preceded the testimony of adoption given by the Holy
   Spirit; but the effect is the sign of the cause. In venturing, he says,
   to call God your Father, you have the advice and direction of the
   Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain that you are the sons of God.
   This agrees with what is elsewhere taught by him, that the Spirit is
   the earnest and pledge of our adoption, and gives to us a well-founded
   belief that God regards us with a father's love.

   "Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
   in our hearts." (2 Corinthians 1:22.)

   "Now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God,
   who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
   (2 Corinthians 5:5.)

   But it will be objected, do not wicked men, too, carry their rashness
   so far as to proclaim that God is their Father? Do they not frequently,
   with greater confidence than others, utter their false boasts? I reply,
   Paul's language does not relate to idle boasting, or to the proud
   opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of
   a pious conscience which accompanies the new birth. This argument can
   have no weight but in the case of believers, for ungodly men have no
   experience of this certainty; as our Lord himself declares.

   "The Spirit of truth," says he, "whom the world cannot receive, because
   it seeth him not, neither knoweth him."
   (John 14:17.)

   This is implied in Paul's words, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
   Son into your hearts. It is not what the persons themselves, in the
   foolish judgment of the flesh, may venture to believe, but what God
   declares in their hearts by his Spirit. The Spirit of his Son is a
   title more strictly adapted to the present occasion than any other that
   could have been employed. We are the sons of God, because we have
   received the same Spirit as his only Son.

   Let it be observed, that Paul ascribes this universally to all
   Christians; for where this pledge of the Divine love towards us is
   wanting, there is assuredly no faith. Hence it is evident what sort of
   Christianity belongs to Popery, since any man who says, that he has the
   Spirit of God, is charged by them with impious presumption. Neither the
   Spirit of God, nor certainty, belongs to their notion of faith. This
   single tenet held by them is a remarkable proof that, in all the
   schools of the Papists, the devil, the father of unbelief, reigns. I
   acknowledge, indeed, that the scholastic divines, when they enjoin upon
   the consciences of men the agitation of perpetual doubt, are in perfect
   agreement with what the natural feelings of mankind would dictate. It
   is the more necessary to fix in our minds this doctrine of Paul, that
   no man is a Christian who has not learned, by the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit, to call God his Father.

   Crying. This participle, I think, is used in order to express greater
   boldness. Hesitation does not allow us to speak freely, but keeps the
   mouth nearly shut, while the half-broken words can hardly escape from a
   stammering tongue. "Crying," on the other hand, expresses firmness and
   unwavering confidence.

   "For we have not received again the spirit of bondage to fear,
   but of freedom to full confidence." (Romans 8:15.)

   Abba, Father. The meaning of these words, I have no doubt, is, that
   calling upon God is common to all languages. It is a fact which bears
   directly on the present subject, that the name Father is given to God
   both by the Hebrews and by the Greeks; as had been predicted by Isaiah,

   "Every tongue shall make confession to my name."
   (Isaiah 45:23.)

   The whole of this subject is handled by the apostle at greater length
   in his Epistle to the Romans. I judge it unnecessary to repeat here
   observations which I have already made in the exposition of that
   Epistle, and which the reader may consult. Since, therefore, Gentiles
   are reckoned among the sons of God, it is evident that adoption comes
   not by the merit of the law, but by the grace of faith.

   7. Wherefore thou art no more a servant. In the Christian Church
   slavery no longer exists, but the condition of the children is free. In
   what respect the fathers under the law were slaves, we have already
   inquired; for their freedom was not yet revealed, but was hidden under
   the coverings and yoke of the law. Our attention is again directed to
   the distinction between the Old and New Testaments. The ancients were
   also sons of God, and heirs through Christ, but we hold the same
   character in a different manner; for we have Christ present with us,
   and in that manner enjoy his blessings.

   8. But when ye as yet knew not God. This is not intended as an
   additional argument; and indeed he had already proved his point so
   fully, that no doubt remained, and the rebuke which was now to be
   administered could not be evaded. His object is to make their fall
   appear more criminal, by comparing it with past events. It is not
   wonderful, he says, that formerly ye did service to them which by
   nature are no gods; for, wherever ignorance of God exists, there must
   be dreadful blindness. You were then wandering in darkness, but how
   disgraceful is it that in the midst of light you should fall into such
   gross errors! The main inference is, that the Galatians were less
   excusable for corrupting the gospel than they had formerly been for
   idolatry. But here it ought to be observed, that, till we have been
   enlightened in the true knowledge of one God, we always serve idols,
   whatever pretext we may throw over the false religion. The lawful
   worship of God, therefore, must be preceded by just views of his
   character. By nature, that is, in reality, they are no gods. Every
   object of worship which men contrive is a creature of their own
   imagination. In the opinion of men idols may be gods, but in reality
   they are nothing.

   9. But now, [67] after that ye have known God. No language can express
   the base ingratitude of departing from God, when he has once been
   known. What is it but to forsake, of our own accord, the light, the
   life, the fountain of all benefits, -- "to forsake," as Jeremiah
   complains,

   "the fountain of living waters, and hew out cisterns,
   broken cisterns, that can hold no water!" (Jeremiah 2:13.)

   Still farther to heighten the blame, he corrects his language, and
   says, or rather have been, known by God; for the greater the grace of
   God is towards us, our guilt in despising it must be the heavier. Paul
   reminds the Galatians whence they had derived the knowledge of God. He
   affirms that they did not obtain it by their own exertions, by the
   acuteness or industry of their own minds, but because, when they were
   at the farthest possible remove from thinking of him, God visited them
   in his mercy. What is said of the Galatians may be extended to all; for
   in all are fulfilled the words of Isaiah,

   "I am sought by them that asked not for me:
   I am found by them that sought me not." (Isaiah 65:1.)

   The origin of our calling is the free election of God, which
   predestinates us to life before we are born. On this depends our
   calling, our faith, our whole salvation.

   How turn ye again? They could not turn again to ceremonies which they
   had never practiced. The expression is figurative, and merely denotes,
   that to fall again into wicked superstition, as if they had never
   received the truth of God, was the height of folly. When he calls the
   ceremonies beggarly elements, he views them as out of Christ, and, what
   is more, as opposed to Christ. To the fathers they were not only
   profitable exercises and aids to piety, but efficacious means of grace.
   But then their whole value lay in Christ, and in the appointment of
   God. The false apostles, on the other hand, neglecting the promises,
   endeavored to oppose the ceremonies to Christ, as if Christ alone were
   not sufficient. That they should be regarded by Paul as worthless
   trifles, cannot excite surprise; but of this I have already spoken. The
   word bondage conveys a reproof for submitting to be slaves. [68]

   10. Ye observe days. He adduces as an instance one description of
   "elements," the observance of days. No condemnation is here given to
   the observance of dates in the arrangements of civil society. The order
   of nature out of which this arises, is fixed and constant. How are
   months and years computed, but by the revolution of the sun and moon?
   What distinguishes summer from winter, or spring from harvest, but the
   appointment of God, -- an appointment which was promised to continue to
   the end of the world? (Genesis 8:22.) The civil observation of days
   contributes not only to agriculture and to matters of politics, and
   ordinary life, but is even extended to the government of the church. Of
   what nature, then, was the observation which Paul reproves? It was that
   which would bind the conscience, by religious considerations, as if it
   were necessary to the worship of God, and which, as he expresses it in
   the Epistle to the Romans, would make a distinction between one day and
   another. (Romans 14:5.)

   When certain days are represented as holy in themselves, when one day
   is distinguished from another on religious grounds, when holy days are
   reckoned a part of divine worship, then days are improperly observed.
   The Jewish Sabbath, new moons, and other festivals, were earnestly
   pressed by the false apostles, because they had been appointed by the
   law. When we, in the present age, intake a distinction of days, we do
   not represent them as necessary, and thus lay a snare for the
   conscience; we do not reckon one day to be more holy than another; we
   do not make days to be the same thing with religion and the worship of
   God; but merely attend to the preservation of order and harmony. The
   observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all
   superstition.

   11. Lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain. The expression is
   harsh, and must have filled the Galatians with alarm; for what hope was
   left to them, if Paul's labor had been in vain? Some have expressed
   astonishment that Paul should be so powerfully affected by the
   observance of days, as almost to designate it a subversion of the whole
   gospel. But if we carefully weigh the whole, we shall see that there
   was just reason; and that the false apostles not only attempted to lay
   the yoke of Jewish bondage on the neck of the church, but filled their
   minds with wicked superstitions. To bring back Christianity to Judaism,
   was in itself no light evil; but far more serious mischief was done,
   when, in opposition to the grace of Christ, they set up holidays as
   meritorious performances, and pretended that this mode of worship would
   propitiate the divine favor. When such doctrines were received, the
   worship of God was corrupted, the grace of Christ made void, and the
   freedom of conscience oppressed.

   Do we wonder that Paul should be afraid that he had labored in vain,
   that the gospel would henceforth be of no service? And since that very
   description of impiety is now supported by Popery, what sort of Christ
   or what sort of gospel does it retain? So far as respects the binding
   of consciences, they enforce the observance of days with not less
   severity than was done by Moses. They consider holidays, not less than
   the false apostles did, to be a part of the worship of God, and even
   connect with them the diabolical notion of merit. The Papists must
   therefore be held equally censurable with the false apostles; and with
   this addition in aggravation, that, while the former proposed to keep
   those days which had been appointed by the law of God, the latter
   enjoin days, rashly stamped with their own seal, to be observed as most
   holy.

   Galatians 4:12-20

   12. Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
   not injured me at all.

   12. Estote ut ego; quia ego quoque sum ut vos. Fratres, rogo vos; nihil
   mihi fecistis injuriae.

   13. Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
   unto you at the first.

   13. Novistis antem, quod per infirmitatem carnis evangelizaverim vobis
   prius;

   14. And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
   rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

   14. Et experimenturn mei, quod fuit in carne mea, non contempsistis,
   neque respuistis; sed tanquam angelum Dei suscepistis me, tanquam
   Christum Iesum.

   15. Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
   that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes,
   and have given them to me.

   15. Ubi igitur beatitude vestra? testimonium enim reddo vobis, quod, si
   possibile fuisset, etiam oculos vestros effossos dedissetis mihi.

   16. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

   16. Ergdne vera loquendo inimicus sum vobis factus?

   17. They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
   you, that ye might affect them.

   17. AEmulantur vos, non bene; imo excludere vos volunt, ut ipsos
   aemulemini.

   18. But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and
   not only when I am present with you.

   18. Bonum autem est aemulari in bono semper, et non tanturn quum
   praesens sum apud vos.

   19. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
   be formed in you,

   19. Filioli mei, quos iterum parturio, donec formetur in vobis
   Christus.

   20. I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I
   stand in doubt of you.

   20. Vellem autem nunc coram esse vobiscum, et routare vocem meam; quia
   anxius sum in vobis.


   12. Be as I am. Having till now spoken roughly, he begins to adopt a
   milder strain. The former harshness had been more than justified by the
   heinousness of the offense; but as he wished to do good, he resolves to
   adopt a style of conciliation. It is the part of a wise pastor to
   consider, not what those who have wandered may justly deserve, but what
   may be the likeliest method of bringing them back to the right path. He
   must "be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort,
   with all long-suffering and doctrine." (2 Timothy 4:2.) Following the
   method which he had recommended to Timothy, he leaves off chiding, and
   begins to use entreaties. I beseech you, he says, and calls them
   brethren, to assure them that no bitterness had mingled with his
   reproofs.

   The words, be as I am, refer to the affection of the mind. As he
   endeavors to accommodate himself to them, so he wishes that they would
   do the like by him in return. For I am as ye are. "As I have no other
   object in view than to promote your benefit, so it is proper that you
   should be prevailed on to adopt moderate views, and to lend a willing,
   obedient ear to my instructions." And here again pastors are reminded
   of their duty to come down, as far as they can, to the people, and to
   study the various dispositions of those with whom they have to deal, if
   they wish to obtain compliance with their message. The proverb still
   holds: "to be loved, you must be lovely."

   Ye have not injured me at all. This is intended to remove the suspicion
   which might have rendered his former reproofs more disagreeable. If we
   think that a person is speaking under a sense of injury, or revenging a
   private quarrel, we turn away our minds from him entirely, and are sure
   to torture whatever he says into an unfavourable interpretation. Paul
   therefore meets the rising prejudice by saying, "So far as respects
   myself, I have no cause to complain of you. It is not on my own
   account, nor from any hostility to you, that I feel warmly; and
   therefore, if I use strong language, it must arise from some other
   cause than hatred or anger."

   13. Ye know that, through infirmity of the flesh. He recalls to their
   recollection the friendly and respectful manner in which they had
   received him, and he does so for two reasons. First, to let them know
   that he loved them, and thus to gain a ready ear to all that he says;
   and secondly, to encourage them, that, as they had begun well, they
   would go on in the same course. This mention of past occurrences, then,
   while it is an expression of his kind regards, is intended likewise as
   an exhortation to act in the same manner as they had done at an earlier
   period.

   By infirmity of the flesh he means here, as in other places, what had a
   tendency to make him appear mean and despised. Flesh denotes his
   outward appearance, which the word infirmity describes to have been
   contemptible. Such was Paul when he came among them, without show,
   without pretense, without worldly honors or rank, without everything
   that could gain him respect or estimation in the eyes of men. Yet all
   this did not prevent the Galatians from giving him the most honorable
   reception. The narrative contributes powerfully to his argument, for
   what was there in Paul to awaken their esteem or veneration, but the
   power of the Holy Spirit alone? Under what pretext, then, will they now
   begin to despise that power? Next, they are charged with inconsistency,
   since no subsequent occurrence in the life of Paul could entitle them
   to esteem him less than before. But this he leaves to be considered by
   the Galatians, contenting himself with indirectly suggesting it as a
   subject of consideration.

   14. My temptation. That is, "Though ye perceived me to be, in a worldly
   point of view, a contemptible person, yet ye did not reject me." He
   calls it a temptation or trial, because it was a thing not unknown or
   hidden, and he did not himself attempt to conceal it, as is usually
   done by ambitious men, who are ashamed of anything about them that may
   lower them in public estimation. It frequently happens that unworthy
   persons receive applause, before their true character has been
   discovered, and shortly afterwards are dismissed with shame and
   disgrace. But widely different was the case of Paul, who had used no
   disguise to impose on the Galatians, but had frankly told them what he
   was.

   As an angel of God. In this light every true minister of Christ ought
   to be regarded. As God employs the services of angels for communicating
   to us his favors, so godly teachers are divinely raised up to
   administer to us the most excellent of all blessings, the doctrine of
   eternal salvation. Not without good reason are they, by whose hands God
   dispenses to us such a treasure, compared to angels: for they too are
   the messengers of God, by whose mouth God speaks to us. And this
   argument is used by Malachi.

   "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law
   at his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts." (Malachi
   2:7.)

   But the apostle rises still higher, and adds, even as Christ Jesus; for
   the Lord himself commands that his ministers shall be viewed in the
   same light as himself.

   "He that heareth you heareth me,
   and he that despiseth you despiseth me." (Luke 10:16.)

   Nor is this wonderful; for it is in his name that they discharge their
   embassy, and thus they hold the rank of him in whose room they act.
   Such is the highly commendatory language which reveals to us at once
   the majesty of the gospel, and the honorable character of its ministry.
   If it be the command of Christ that his ministers shall be thus
   honored, it is certain that contempt of them proceeds from the
   instigation of the devil; and indeed they never can be despised so long
   as the word of God is esteemed. In vain do the Papists attempt to hold
   out this pretext for their own arrogant pretensions. As they are
   plainly the enemies of Christ, how absurd is it that they should assume
   the garb, and take to themselves the character, of Christ's servants!
   If they wish to obtain the honors of angels, let them perform the duty
   of angels: if they wish that we should listen to them as to Christ, let
   them convey to us faithfully his pure word.

   15. Where is there your blessedness? Paul had made them happy, and he
   intimates that the pious affection with which they formerly regarded
   him was an expression of their happiness. But now, by allowing
   themselves to be deprived of the services of him to whom they ought to
   have attributed whatever knowledge they possessed of Christ, they gave
   evidence that they were unhappy. This hint was intended to produce keen
   reflection. "What? Shall all this be lost? Will you forfeit all the
   advantage of having once heard Christ speaking by my lips? Shall the
   foundation in the faith which you received from me be to no purpose?
   Shall your falling away now destroy the glory of your obedience in the
   presence of God?" In short, by despising the pure doctrine which they
   had embraced, they throw away, of their own accord, the blessedness
   which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction
   in which their unhappy career must terminate.

   For I bear you record. It is not enough that pastors be respected, if
   they are not also loved; for both are necessary to make the doctrine
   they preach be fully relished; and both, the apostle declares, had
   existed among the Galatians. He had already spoken of their respect for
   him, and he now speaks of their love. To be willing to pluck out their
   own eyes, if it had been necessary, was an evidence of very
   extraordinary love, stronger than the willingness to part with life.

   16. Am I therefore become your enemy? He now returns to speak about
   himself. It was entirely their own fault, he says, that they had
   changed their minds. Though it is a common remark, that truth begets
   hatred, yet, except through the malice and wickedness of those who
   cannot endure to hear it, truth is never hateful. While he vindicates
   himself from any blame in the unhappy difference between them, he
   indirectly censures their ingratitude. Yet still his advice is
   friendly, not to reject, on rash or light grounds, the apostleship of
   one whom they had formerly considered to be worthy of their warmest
   love. What can be more unbecoming than that the hatred of truth should
   change enemies into friends? His aim then is, not so much to upbraid,
   as to move them to repentance.

   17. They are jealous of you. He comes at length to the false apostles,
   and does more by silence to make them odious, than if he had given
   their names; for we usually abstain from naming those whose very names
   produce in us dislike and aversion. He mentions the immoderate ambition
   of those men, and warns the Galatians not to be led astray by their
   appearance of zeal. The comparison is borrowed from honorable love, as
   contrasted with those professions of regard which arise from unhallowed
   desires. Jealousy, on the part of the false apostles, ought not to
   impose upon them; for it proceeded not from right zeal, but from an
   improper desire of obtaining reputation, -- a desire most unlike that
   holy jealousy of which Paul speaks to the Corinthians.

   "For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy; for I have espoused you
   to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
   But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
   subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
   in Christ."
   (2 Corinthians 11:2, 3.)

   To expose still more fully their base arts, he corrects his language.
   Yea, they would exclude you [69] They not only endeavor to gain your
   affections, but, as they cannot obtain possession of you by any other
   means, they endeavor to kindle strife between us. When you have been
   thrown as it were destitute, they expect that you will yield yourselves
   up to them; for they perceive that, so long as there shall be
   maintained between us a religious harmony, they can have no influence.
   This stratagem is frequently resorted to by all the ministers of Satan.
   By producing in the people a dislike of their pastor, they hope
   afterwards to draw them to themselves; and, having disposed of the
   rival, to obtain quiet possession. A careful and judicious examination
   of their conduct will discover that in this way they always begin.

   18. But it is good to be the object of jealousy. It is hard to say
   whether this refers to himself or to the Galatians. Good ministers are
   exhorted to cherish holy jealousy in watching over the churches,

   "that they may present them as a chaste virgin to Christ."
   (2 Corinthians 11:2.)

   If it refers to Paul, the meaning will be: "I confess that I also am
   jealous of you, but with a totally different design: and I do so as
   much when I am absent as when I am present, because I do not seek my
   own advantage." But I am rather inclined to view it as referring to the
   Galatians, though in this case it will admit of more than one
   interpretation. It may mean: "They indeed attempt to withdraw your
   affections from me, that, when you are thrown destitute, you may go
   over to them; but do you, who loved me while I was present, continue to
   cherish the same regard for me when I am absent." But a more correct
   explanation is suggested by the opposite senses which the word
   zelousthai bears. As, in the former verse, he had used the word jealous
   in a bad sense, denoting an improper way of accomplishing an object, so
   here he uses it in a good sense, denoting a zealous imitation of the
   good qualities of another. By condemning improper jealousy, he now
   exhorts the Galatians to engage in a different sort of competition, and
   that, too, while he was absent.

   19. My little children. The word children is still softer and more
   affectionate than brethren; and the diminutive, little children, is an
   expression, not of contempt, but of endearment, though, at the same
   time, it suggests the tender years of those who ought now to have
   arrived at full age. (Hebrews 5:12.) The style is abrupt, which is
   usually the case with highly pathetic passages. Strong feeling, from
   the difficulty of finding adequate expression, breaks off our words
   when half uttered, while the powerful emotion chokes the utterance.

   Of whom I travail in birth again. This phrase is added, to convey still
   more fully his vehement affection, which endured, on their account, the
   throes and pangs of a mother. It denotes likewise his anxiety; for

   "a woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is
   come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no
   more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world." (John
   16:21.)

   The Galatians had already been conceived and brought forth; but, after
   their revolt, they must now be begotten a second time.

   Until Christ be formed in you. By these words he soothes their anger;
   for he does not set aside the former birth, but says that they must be
   again nourished in the womb, as if they had not yet been fully formed.
   That Christ should be formed in us is the same thing with our being
   formed in Christ; for we are born so as to become new creatures in him;
   and he, on the other hand, is born in us, so that we live his life.
   Since the true image of Christ, through the superstitions introduced by
   the false apostles, had been defaced, Paul labors to restore that image
   in all its perfection and brightness. This is done by the ministers of
   the gospel, when they give

   "milk to babes, and strong meat to them that are of full age," (Hebrews
   5:13, 14,)

   and, in short, ought to be their employment during the whole course of
   their preaching. But Paul here compares himself to a woman in labor,
   because the Galatians were not yet completely born.

   This is a remarkable passage for illustrating the efficacy of the
   Christian ministry. True, we are "born of God," (1 John 3:9;) but,
   because he employs a minister and preaching as his instruments for that
   purpose, he is pleased to ascribe to them that work which Himself
   performs, through the power of his Spirit, in co-operation with the
   labors of man. Let us always attend to this distinction, that, when a
   minister is contrasted with God, he is nothing, and can do nothing, and
   is utterly useless; but, because the Holy Spirit works efficaciously by
   means of him, he comes to be regarded and praised as an agent. Still,
   it is not what he can do in himself, or apart from God, but what God
   does by him, that is there described. If ministers wish to do anything,
   let them labor to form Christ, not to form themselves, in their
   hearers. The writer is now so oppressed with grief, that he almost
   faints from exhaustion without completing his sentence.

   20. I would wish to be present with you now. This is a most serious
   expostulation, the complaint of a father so perplexed by the misconduct
   of his sons, that he looks around him for advice, and knows not to what
   hand to turn. [70] He wishes to have an opportunity of personally
   addressing them, because we thus obtain a better idea of what is
   adapted to present circumstances; because, according as the hearer is
   affected, according as he is submissive or obstinate, we are enabled to
   regulate our discourse. But something more than this was meant by the
   desire to change the voice [71] He was prepared most cheerfully to
   assume a variety of forms, and even, if the case required it, to frame
   a new language. This is a course which pastors ought most carefully to
   follow. They must not be entirely guided by their own inclinations, or
   by the bent of their own genius, but must accommodate themselves, as
   far as the case will allow, to the capacity of the people, -- with this
   reservation, however, that they are to proceed no farther than
   conscience shall dictate, [72] and that no departure from integrity
   shall be made, in order to gain the favor of the people.

   Galatians 4:21-26

   21. Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
   law?

   21. Dicite mihi, qui sub Lege vultis esse, Legem non auditis?

   22. For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
   bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

   22. Scriptum est enim, quod Abraham duos filios habuit; unum ex
   ancilla, alterum ex libera.

   23. But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of
   the freewoman was by promise.

   23. Sed qui erat ex ancilla, secundum carnem erat genitus: qui vero ex
   libera, per promissionem.

   24. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the
   one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

   24. Quae allegorica sunt; nam duae sunt pactiones, una quidem a monte
   Sina, quae in servitutem generat; ea est Agar.

   25. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
   which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

   25. Nam Agar, Sina mons est in Arabia; ex adverso autem respondet ei
   quae nunc est Ierusalem; servit enim cum liberis suis.

   26. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
   all.

   26. Quae autem sursum est Ierusalem, libera est, quae mater est nostra
   omnium.


   21. Tell me. Having given exhortations adapted to touch the feelings,
   he follows up his former doctrine by an illustration of great beauty.
   Viewed simply as an argument, it would not be very powerful; but, as a
   confirmation added to a most satisfactory chain of reasoning, it is not
   unworthy of attention.

   To be under the law, signifies here, to come under the yoke of the law,
   on the condition that God will act toward you according to the covenant
   of the law, and that you, in return, bind yourself to keep the law. In
   any other sense than this, all believers are under the law; but the
   apostle treats, as we have already said, of the law with its
   appendages.

   22. For it is written. No man who has a choice given him will be so mad
   as to despise freedom, and prefer slavery. But here the apostle teaches
   us, that they who are under the law are slaves. Unhappy men! who
   willingly choose this condition, when God desires to make them free. He
   gives a representation of this in the two sons of Abraham, one of whom,
   the son of a slave, held by his mother's condition; [73] while the
   other, the son of a free woman, obtained the inheritance. He afterwards
   applies the whole history to his purpose, and illustrates it in an
   elegant manner.

   In the first place, as the other party armed themselves with the
   authority of the law, the apostle quotes the law on the other side. The
   law was the name usually given to the Five Books of Moses. Again, as
   the history which he quotes appeared to have no bearing on the
   question, he gives to it an allegorical interpretation. But as the
   apostle declares that these things are allegorized, (allegoroumena,)
   Origen, and many others along with him, have seized the occasion of
   torturing Scripture, in every possible manner, away from the true
   sense. They concluded that the literal sense is too mean and poor, and
   that, under the outer bark of the letter, there lurk deeper mysteries,
   which cannot be extracted but by beating out allegories. And this they
   had no difficulty in accomplishing; for speculations which appear to be
   ingenious have always been preferred, and always will be preferred, by
   the world to solid doctrine.

   With such approbation the licentious system gradually attained such a
   height, that he who handled Scripture for his own amusement not only
   was suffered to pass unpunished, but even obtained the highest
   applause. For many centuries no man was considered to be ingenious, who
   had not the skill and daring necessary for changing into a variety of
   curious shapes the sacred word of God. This was undoubtedly a
   contrivance of Satan to undermine the authority of Scripture, and to
   take away from the reading of it the true advantage. God visited this
   profanation by a just judgment, when he suffered the pure meaning of
   the Scripture to be buried under false interpretations.

   Scripture, they say, is fertile, and thus produces a variety of
   meanings. [74] I acknowledge that Scripture is a most rich and
   inexhaustible fountain of all wisdom; but I deny that its fertility
   consists in the various meanings which any man, at his pleasure, may
   assign. Let us know, then, that the true meaning of Scripture is the
   natural and obvious meaning; and let us embrace and abide by it
   resolutely. Let us not only neglect as doubtful, but boldly set aside
   as deadly corruptions, those pretended expositions, which lead us away
   from the natural meaning.

   But what reply shall we make to Paul's assertion, that these things are
   allegorical? Paul certainly does not mean that Moses wrote the history
   for the purpose of being turned into an allegory, but points out in
   what way the history may be made to answer the present subject. This is
   done by observing a figurative representation of the Church there
   delineated. And a mystical interpretation of this sort (anagoge) was
   not inconsistent with the true and literal meaning, when a comparison
   was drawn between the Church and the family of Abraham. As the house of
   Abraham was then a true Church, so it is beyond all doubt that the
   principal and most memorable events which happened in it are so many
   types to us. As in circumcision, in sacrifices, in the whole Levitical
   priesthood, there was an allegory, as there is an allegory at the
   present day in our sacraments, -- so was there likewise in the house of
   Abraham; but this does not involve a departure from the literal
   meaning. In a word, Paul adduces the history, as containing a
   figurative representation of the two covenants in the two wives of
   Abraham, and of the two nations in his two sons. And Chrysostom,
   indeed, acknowledges that the word allegory points out the present
   application to be (katachresis) [75] different from the natural
   meaning; which is perfectly true.

   23. But he who was of the bond woman. Both were sons of Abraham
   according to the flesh; but in Isaac there was this peculiarity, that
   he had the promise of grace. In Ishmael there was nothing besides
   nature; in Isaac there was the election of God, signified in part by
   the manner of his birth, which was not in the ordinary course, but
   miraculous. Yet there is an indirect reference to the calling of the
   Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews: for the latter boast of their
   ancestry, while the former, without any human interference, are become
   the spiritual offspring of Abraham.

   24. These are the two covenants. I have thought it better to adopt this
   translation, in order not to lose sight of the beauty of the
   comparison; for Paul compares the two diathokai, to two mothers, and to
   employ testamentum, (a testament,) which is a neuter noun, for denoting
   a mother, would be harsh. The word pactio (a covenant) appears to be,
   on that account, more appropriate; and indeed the desire of obtaining
   perspicuity, as well as elegance, has led me to make this choice. [76]

   The comparison is now formally introduced. As in the house of Abraham
   there were two mothers, so are there also in the Church of God.
   Doctrine is the mother of whom we are born, and is twofold, Legal and
   Evangelical. The legal mother, whom Hagar resembles, gendereth to
   bondage. Sarah again, represents the second, which gendereth to
   freedom; though Paul begins higher, and makes our first mother Sinai,
   and our second, Jerusalem. The two covenants, then, are the mothers, of
   whom children unlike one another are born; for the legal covenant makes
   slaves, and the evangelical covenant makes freemen.

   But all this may, at first sight, appear absurd; for there are none of
   God's children who are not born to freedom, and therefore the
   comparison does not apply. I answer, what Paul says is true in two
   respects; for the law formerly brought forth its disciples, (among whom
   were included the holy prophets, and other believers,) to slavery,
   though not to permanent slavery, but because God placed them for a time
   under the law as "a schoolmaster." [77] (Galatians 3:25.) Under the
   vail of ceremonies, and of the whole economy by which they were
   governed, their freedom was concealed: to the outward eye nothing but
   slavery appeared. "Ye have not," says Paul to the Romans, "received the
   spirit of bondage again to fear." (Romans 8:15.) Those holy fathers,
   though inwardly they were free in the sight of God, yet in outward
   appearance differed nothing from slaves, and thus resembled their
   mother's condition. But the doctrine of the gospel bestows upon its
   children perfect freedom as soon as they are born, and brings them up
   in a liberal manner.

   Paul does not, I acknowledge, speak of that kind of children, as the
   context will show. By the children of Sinai, it will afterwards be
   explained, are meant hypocrites, who are at length expelled from the
   Church of God, and deprived of the inheritance. What, then, is the
   gendering to bondage, which forms the subject of the present dispute?
   It denotes those who make a wicked abuse of the law, by finding in it
   nothing but what tends to slavery. Not so the pious fathers, who lived
   under the Old Testament; for their slavish birth by the law did not
   hinder them from having Jerusalem for their mother in spirit. But those
   who adhere to the bare law, and do not acknowledge it to be "a
   schoolmaster to bring them to Christ," (Galatians 3:24,) but rather
   make it a hinderance to prevent their coming to him, are the
   Ishmaelites born to slavery.

   It will again be objected, why does the apostle say that such persons
   are born of God's covenant, and are considered to belong to the Church?
   I answer, strictly speaking, they are not God's children, but are
   degenerate and spurious, and are disclaimed by God, whom they falsely
   call their Father. They receive this name in the Church, not because
   they are members of it in reality, but because for a time they presume
   to occupy that place, and impose on men by the disguise which they
   wear. The apostle here views the Church, as it appears in this world:
   but on this subject we shall afterwards speak.

   25. For Agar is mount Sinai [78] I shall not waste time in refuting the
   expositions of other writers; for Jerome's conjecture, that Mount Sinai
   had two names, is trifling; and the disquisitions of Chrysostom about
   the agreement of the names are equally unworthy of notice. Sinai is
   called Hagar, [79] because it is a type or figure, as the Passover was
   Christ. The situation of the mountain is mentioned by way of contempt.
   It lies in Arabia, beyond the limits of the holy land, by which the
   eternal inheritance was prefigured. The wonder is, that in so familiar
   a matter they erred so egregiously.

   And answers, on the other hand. The Vulgate translates it, is joined
   (conjunctus est) to Jerusalem; and Erasmus makes it, borders on
   (confinis) Jerusalem; but I have adopted the phrase, on the other hand,
   (ex adverso,) in order to avoid obscurity. For the apostle certainly
   does not refer to nearness, or relative position, but to resemblance,
   as respects the present comparison. The word, sustoicha, which is
   translated corresponding to, denotes those things which are so arranged
   as to have a mutual relation to each other, and a similar word,
   suatoichia, when applied to trees and other objects, conveys the idea
   of their following in regular order. Mount Sinai is said (sustoichein)
   to correspond to that which is now Jerusalem, in the same sense as
   Aristotle says that Rhetoric is (antistrophos) the counterpart to
   Logic, by a metaphor borrowed from lyric compositions, which were
   usually arranged in two parts, so adapted as to be sung in harmony. In
   short, the word, sustoichei, corresponds, means nothing more than that
   it belongs to the same class.

   But why does Paul compare the present Jerusalem with Mount Sinai?
   Though I was once of a different opinion, yet I agree with Chrysostom
   and Ambrose, who explain it as referring to the earthly Jerusalem, and
   who interpret the words, which now is, tho nun ierousalem, as marking
   the slavish doctrine and worship into which it had degenerated. It
   ought to have been a lively image of the new Jerusalem, and a
   representation of its character. But such as it now is, it is rather
   related to Mount Sinai. Though the two places may be widely distant
   from each other, they are perfectly alike in all their most important
   features. This is a heavy reproach against the Jews, whose real mother
   was not Sarah but the spurious Jerusalem, twin sister of Hagar; who
   were therefore slaves born of a slave, though they haughtily boasted
   that they were the sons of Abraham.

   26. But Jerusalem, which is above. The Jerusalem which he calls above,
   or heavenly, is not contained in heaven; nor are we to seek for it out
   of this world; for the Church is spread over the whole world, and is a
   "stranger and pilgrim on the earth." (Hebrews 11:13.) Why then is it
   said to be from heaven? Because it originates in heavenly grace; for
   the sons of God are

   "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
   nor of the will of man," (John 1:13,)

   but by the power of the Holy Spirit. The heavenly Jerusalem, which
   derives its origin from heaven, and dwells above by faith, is the
   mother of believers. To the Church, under God, we owe it that we are

   "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,"
   (1 Peter 1:23,)

   and from her we obtain the milk and the food by which we are afterwards
   nourished.

   Such are the reasons why the Church is called the mother of believers.
   And certainly he who refuses to be a son of the Church in vain desires
   to have God as his Father; for it is only through the instrumentality
   of the Church that we are "born of God," (1 John 3:9,) and brought up
   through the various stages of childhood and youth, till we arrive at
   manhood. This designation, "the mother of us all," reflects the highest
   credit and the highest honor on the Church. But the Papists are fools
   and twice children, who expect to give us uneasiness by producing these
   words; for their mother is an adulteress, who brings forth to death the
   children of the devil; and how foolish is the demand, that the children
   of God should surrender themselves to her to be cruelly slain! Might
   not the synagogue of Jerusalem at that time have assumed such haughty
   pretensions, with far higher plausibility than Rome at the present day?
   and yet we see how Paul strips her of every honorable distinction, and
   consigns her to the lot of Hagar.

   instances of this trope. Leviticus 26:30, -- And I will cast your

   your idols, which shall be as much destroyed as the body is when it is

   Hosea 14:2. But the boldest catachresis, perhaps, in all the Holy

   [76] To a Latin scholar the author's meaning is obvious enough. But it

   natural and graceful, in a metaphorical description of a mother, than
   testamentum, (a testament,) which, being a neuter noun, sounds harshly
   in this connection. In that point of view, the preference is little
   else than a matter of taste; but, on far higher grounds, "covenant" is
   a more faithful translation than "testament;" and a careful
   investigation of the meaning of diatheke would contribute greatly to

   it is obvious that to `Agar, in the neuter gender, cannot signify the
   woman Hagar; and Paul has not been guilty of a grammatical error, since
   the passage must be translated, The word Hagar denotes Mount Sinai in
   Arabia.'" -- Michaelis. "That this was an appellation of Sinai among
   the people of the surrounding country, we have the testimony of
   Chrysostom and the ancient commentators, which is also confirmed by the
   accounts of modern travellers. And it might well have it, since hgr
   (hagar) in Arabia signifies a rock, or rocky mountain; and as Sinai is
   remarkably such, it might be kat ' exochen, called to `Agar." --

   Galatians 4:27-31

   27. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
   forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
   more children than she which hath an husband.

   27. Scriptum est enim: Exulta, sterilis, qum non paris; erumpe et
   elama, quae non parturis; quaE plures erunt liberi desertae quam
   habentis maritum. (Isaiah 54:1.)

   28. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

   28. Nos autem, fratres, secundum Issac, promissionis sumus filii.
   (Romans 9:7.)

   29. But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
   was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

   29. Sed quemadmodum tunc, qui secundum carnem erat genitus,
   persequebatur eum qui secundum Spiritum genitus erat; sic et nunc.

   30. Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
   her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of
   the freewoman.

   30. Sed quid dicit Scriptura? Ejice ancillam, et filium ejus; non enim
   haereditatem obtinebit filius ancillae cum filio liberae. (Genesis
   21:10.)

   31. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the
   free.

   31. Ergo, fratres, non sumus ancillae filii, sed liberae.


   27. For it is written. The apostle proves, by a quotation from Isaiah,
   that the lawful sons of the Church are born according to the promise.
   The passage is in Isaiah 54 where the prophet speaks of the kingdom of
   Christ and the calling of the Gentiles, and promises to the barren wife
   and the widow a numerous offspring; for it is on this ground that he
   exhorts the Church to "sing" and "rejoice." The design of the apostle,
   let it be carefully remarked, is to deprive the Jews of all claim to
   that spiritual Jerusalem to which the prophecy relates. Isaiah
   proclaims, that her children shall be gathered out of all the nations
   of the earth, and not by any preparation of hers, but by the free grace
   and blessing of God.

   He next concludes that we become the sons of God by promise, after the
   example (kata 'Isaak) of Isaac, and that in no other way do we obtain
   this honor. To readers little skilled or practiced in the examination
   of Scripture, this reasoning may appear inconclusive; because they do
   not hold the most undoubted of all principles, that all the promises,
   being founded on the Messiah, are of free grace. It was because the
   apostle took this for granted, that he so fearlessly contrasted the
   promise with the law.

   29. As then, he that was born after the flesh. He denounces the cruelty
   of the false apostles, who wantonly insulted pious persons that placed
   all their confidence in Christ. There was abundant need that the
   uneasiness of the oppressed should be soothed by consolation, and that
   the cruelty of their oppressors should be severely checked. It is not
   wonderful, he says, that the children of the law, at the present day,
   do what Ishmael their father at first did, who, trusting to his being
   the first-born, persecuted Isaac the true heir. With the same proud
   disdain do his posterity now, on account of outward ceremonies,
   circumcision, and the various services of the law, molest and vaunt
   over the lawful sons of God. The Spirit is again contrasted with the
   flesh, that is, the calling of God with human appearance. (1 Samuel
   16:7.) So the disguise is admitted to be possessed by the followers of
   the Law and of works, but the reality is claimed for those who rely on
   the calling of God alone, and depend upon his grace.

   Persecuted. But persecution is nowhere mentioned, only Moses says that
   Ishmael was mtshq, (metzahek,) mocking, (Genesis 21:9;) and by this
   participle he intimates that Ishmael ridiculed his brother Isaac. The
   explanation offered by some Jews, that this was a simple smile, is
   entirely inadmissible; for what cruelty would it have argued, that a
   harmless smile should have been so fearfully revenged? There cannot
   then be a doubt that he maliciously endeavored to provoke the child
   Isaac by reproachful language.

   But how widely distant is this from persecution? [80] And yet it is not
   idly or unguardedly that Paul enlarges on this point. No persecution
   ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be
   undermined by the reproaches of wicked men. Neither blows, nor
   scourging, nor nails, nor thorns, occasioned to our Lord such intense
   suffering as that blasphemy:

   "He trusted in God; what availeth it to him?
   for he is deprived of all assistance." (Matthew 27:43.)

   There is more venom in this than in all persecutions; for how much more
   alarming is it that the grace of Divine adoption shall be made void,
   than that this frail life shall be taken from us? Ishmael did not
   persecute his brother with the sword; but, what is worse, he treated
   him with haughty disdain by trampling under foot the promise of God.
   All persecutions arise from this source, that wicked men despise and
   hate in the elect the grace of God; a memorable instance of which we
   have in the history of Cain and Abel. (Genesis 4:8.)

   This reminds us, that not only ought we to be filled with horror at
   outward persecutions, when the enemies of religion slay us with fire
   and sword; when they banish, imprison, torture, or scourge; but when
   they attempt, by their blasphemies, to make void our confidence, which
   rests on the promises of God; when they ridicule our salvation, when
   they wantonly laugh to scorn the whole gospel. Nothing ought to wound
   our minds so deeply as contempt of God, and reproaches cast upon His
   grace: nor is there any kind of persecution more deadly than when the
   salvation of the soul is assailed. We who have escaped from the tyranny
   of the Pope, are not called to encounter the swords of wicked men. But
   how blind must we be, if we are not affected by that spiritual
   persecution, in which they strive, by every method, to extinguish that
   doctrine, from which we draw the breath of life! -- when they attack
   our faith by their blasphemies, and shake not a few of the less
   informed! For my own part, I am far more grieved by the fury of the
   Epicureans than of the Papists. They do not attack us by open violence;
   but, in proportion as the name of God is more dear to me than my own
   life, the diabolical conspiracy which I see in operation to extinguish
   all fear and worship of God, to root out the remembrance of Christ, or
   to abandon it to the jeers of the ungodly, cannot but rack my mind with
   greater anxiety, than if a whole country were burning in one
   conflagration:

   30. But what saith the Scripture? There was some consolation in knowing
   that we do but share the lot of our father Isaac; but it is a still
   greater consolation, when he adds, that hypocrites, with all their
   boasting, can gain nothing more than to be cast out of the spiritual
   family of Abraham; and that, to whatever extent they may harass us for
   a time, the inheritance will certainly be ours. Let believers cheer
   themselves with this consolation, that the tyranny of the Ishmaelites
   will not last for ever. They appear to have reached the highest
   pre-eminence, and, proud of their birthright, look down upon us with
   contempt; but they will one day be declared to be the descendants of
   Hagar, the sons of a slave, and unworthy of the inheritance.

   Let us be instructed by this beautiful passage,

   "not to fret ourselves because of evil-doers,
   neither be envious against the workers of iniquity,"
   (Psalm 37:1,)

   when they hold a temporary habitation and rank in the Church, but
   patiently to look for the end which awaits them. There are many
   pretended Christians, or strangers, who hold a place in the Church, but
   who afterwards give evidence of their departure from the faith, as he
   who, proud of his birthright, at first reigned, was cast out like a
   foreigner with the posterity of Ishmael. Some censorious persons smile
   at Paul's simplicity, in comparing a woman's passion, arising out of a
   trifling quarrel, to a judgment of God. But they overlook the decree of
   God, which took effect in such a manner, as to make it manifest that
   the whole transaction was directed by a heavenly providence. That
   Abraham should have been commanded to humor his wife (Genesis 21:12)
   entirely in the matter, is no doubt extraordinary, but proves that God
   employed the services of Sarah for confirming his own promise. In a
   word, the casting out of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence
   and the accomplishment of that promise, "In Isaac shall thy seed be
   called," (Genesis 21:12,) -- not in Ishmael. Although, therefore, it
   was the revenging of a woman's quarrel, yet God did not the less make
   known his sentence by her mouth as a type of the Church.

   31. So then, brethren. He now exhorts the Galatians to prefer the
   condition of the children of Sarah to that of the children of Hagar;
   and having reminded them that, by the grace of Christ, they were born
   to freedom, he desires them to continue in the same condition. If we
   shall call the Papists, Ishmaelites and Hagarites, and boast that we
   are the lawful children, they will smile at us; but if the two subjects
   in dispute be fairly compared, the most ignorant person will be at no
   loss to decide.

   Galatians 5:1-6

   1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
   free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

   1. In libertate igitur, qua Christus nos liberavit, state; et ne rursum
   jugo servitutis implicemini.

   2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
   profit you nothing.

   2. Ecee, ego Paulus denuncio vobis, quod, si circumcidamini, Christus
   vobis nihil proderit.

   3. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
   debtor to do the whole law.

   3. Testificor enim rursum cuivis homini, qui circumciditur, quod
   debitor sit totius Legis faciendae.

   4. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
   justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

   4. Exinaniti estis a Christo, quicunque per Legem justificamini, a
   gratia excidistis.

   5. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
   faith.

   5. Nos enim Spiritu, ex fide, spem justitiae expectamus.

   6. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

   6. Nam in Christo Iesu neque Circumcisio quicquam valet, neque
   Praeputium; sed fides per dilectionero operans.


   1. Stand fast therefore. After having told them that they are the
   children of the free woman, he now reminds them that they ought not
   lightly to despise a freedom so precious. And certainly it is an
   invaluable blessing, in defense of which it is our duty to fight, even
   to death; since not only the highest temporal considerations, but our
   eternal interests also, animate us to the contest. [81] Many persons,
   having never viewed the subject in this light, charge us with excessive
   zeal, when they see us so warmly and earnestly contending for freedom
   of faith as to outward matters, in opposition to the tyranny of the
   Pope. Under this cloak, our adversaries raise a prejudice against us
   among ignorant people, as if the whole object of our pursuit were
   licentiousness, which is the relaxation of all discipline. But wise and
   skillful persons are aware that this is one of the most important
   doctrines connected with salvation. This is not a question whether you
   shall eat this or that food, -- whether you shall observe or neglect a
   particular day, (which is the foolish notion entertained by many, and
   the slander uttered by some,) but what is your positive duty before
   God, what is necessary to salvation, and what cannot be omitted without
   sin. In short, the controversy relates to the liberty of conscience,
   when placed before the tribunal of God.

   The liberty of which Paul speaks is exemption from the ceremonies of
   the law, the observance of which was demanded by the false apostles as
   necessary. But let the reader, at the same time, remember, that such
   liberty is only a part of that which Christ has procured for us: for
   how small a matter would it be, if he had only freed us from
   ceremonies? This is but a stream, which must be traced to a higher
   source. It is because

   "Christ was made a curse, that he might redeem us
   from the curse of the law," (Galatians 3:13;)

   because he has revolted the power of the law" so far as it held us
   liable to the judgment of God under the penalty of eternal death;
   because, in a word, he has rescued us from the tyranny of sin, Satan,
   and death. Thus, under one department is included the whole class; but
   on this subject we shall speak more fully on the Epistle to the
   Colossians.

   This liberty was procured for us by Christ on the cross: the fruit and
   possession of it are bestowed upon us through the Gospel. Well does
   Paul, then, warn the Galatians, not to be entangled again with the yoke
   of bondage, -- that is, not to allow a snare to be laid for their
   consciences. For if men lay upon our shoulders an unjust burden, it may
   be borne; but if they endeavor to bring our consciences into bondage,
   we must resist valiantly, even to death. If men be permitted to bind
   our consciences, we shall be deprived of an invaluable blessing, and an
   insult will be, at the same time, offered to Christ, the Author of our
   freedom. But what is the force of the word again, in the exhortation,
   "and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage?" for the
   Galatians had never lived under the law. It simply means that they were
   not to be entangled, as if they had not been redeemed by the grace of
   Christ. Although the law was given to Jews, not to Gentiles, yet, apart
   from Christ, neither the one nor the other enjoys any freedom, but
   absolute bondage.

   2. Behold, I Paul. He could not have pronounced a severer threatening
   than that it would exclude them entirely from the grace of Christ. But
   what is the meaning of this, that Christ will profit nothing to all who
   are circumcised? Did Christ profit nothing to Abraham? Nay, it was in
   order that Christ might profit him that he received circumcision. If we
   say that it was in force till the coming of Christ, what reply shall we
   make to the case of Timothy? We must observe, that Paul's reasoning is
   directed not so properly against the outward rite or ceremony, as
   against the wicked doctrine of the false apostles, who pretended that
   it was a necessary part of the worship of God, and at the same time
   made it a ground of confidence as a meritorious work. These diabolical
   contrivances made Christ to profit nothing; not that the false apostles
   denied Christ, or wished him to be entirely set aside, but that they
   made such a division between his grace and the works of the law as to
   leave not more than the half of salvation due to Christ. The apostle
   contends that Christ cannot be divided in this way, and that he
   "profiteth nothing," unless he is wholly embraced.

   And what else do our modern Papists but thrust upon us, in place of
   circumcision, trifles of their own invention? The tendency of their
   whole doctrine is to blend the grace of Christ with the merit of works,
   which is impossible. Whoever wishes to have the half of Christ, loses
   the whole. And yet the Papists think themselves exceedingly acute when
   they tell us that they ascribe nothing to works, except through the
   influence of the grace of Christ, as if this were a different error
   from what was charged on the Galatians. They did not believe that they
   had departed from Christ, or relinquished his grace; and yet they lost
   Christ entirely, when that important part of evangelical doctrine was
   corrupted.

   The expression Behold, I Paul, is very emphatic; for he places himself
   before them, and gives his name, to remove all appearance of
   hesitation. And though his authority had begun to be less regarded
   among the Galatians, he asserts that it is sufficient to put down every
   adversary.

   3. For I testify again. What he now advances is proved by the
   contradiction involved in the opposite statement. He who is a debtor to
   do the whole law [82] will never escape death, but will always continue
   to be held as guilty; for no man will ever be found who satisfies the
   law. [83] Such being the obligation, the man must unavoidably be
   condemned, and Christ can render him no service. We see then the
   contradictory nature of the two propositions, that we are partakers of
   the grace of Christ, and yet that we are bound to fulfill the whole
   law. But will it not then follow, that none of the fathers were saved?
   Will it not also follow that Timothy was ruined, since Paul caused him
   to be circumcised? (Acts 16:3.) Wo to us then, till we have been
   emancipated from the law, for subjection is inseparable from
   circumcision!

   It ought to be observed that Paul is accustomed to view circumcision in
   two different aspects, as every person who has best, owed a moderate
   degree of attention on his writings will easily perceive. In the
   Epistle to the Romans, (Romans 4:11,) he calls it "a seal of the
   righteousness of faith;" and there, under circumcision, he includes
   Christ and the free promise of salvation. But here he contrasts it with
   Christ, and faith, and the gospel, and grace, -- viewing it simply as a
   legal covenant, founded on the merit of works.

   The consequence is, as we have already said, that he does not always
   speak about circumcision in the same way; but the reason of the
   difference must be taken into account. When he views circumcision in
   its own nature, he properly makes it to be a symbol of grace, because
   such was the appointment of God. But when he is dealing with the false
   apostles, who abused circumcision by making it an instrument for
   destroying the Gospel, he does not there consider the purpose for which
   it was appointed by the Lord, but attacks the corruption which has
   proceeded from men.

   A very striking example occurs in this passage. When Abraham had
   received a promise concerning Christ, and justification by free grace,
   and eternal salvation, circumcision was added, in order to confirm the
   promise; and thus it became, by the appointment of God, a sacrament,
   which was subservient to faith. Next come the false apostles, who
   pretend that it is a meritorious work, and recommend the observance of
   the law, making a profession of obedience to it to be signified by
   circumcision as an initiatory rite. Paul makes no reference here to the
   appointment of God, but attacks the unscriptural views of the false
   apostles.

   It will be objected, that the abuses, whatever they may be, which
   wicked men commit, do not at all impair the sacred ordinances of God. I
   reply, the Divine appointment of circumcision was only for a time.
   After the coming of Christ, it ceased to be a Divine institution,
   because baptism had suceeeded in its room. Why, then, was Timothy
   circumcised? Not certainly on his own account, but for the sake of weak
   brethren, to whom that point was yielded. To show more fully the
   agreement between the doctrine of the Papists and that which Paul
   opposes, it must be observed, that the sacraments, when we partake of
   them in a sincere manner, are not the works of men, but of God. In
   baptism or the Lord's supper, we do nothing but present ourselves to
   God, in order to receive his grace. Baptism, viewed in regard to us, is
   a passive work: we bring nothing to it but faith; and all that belongs
   to it is laid up in Christ. But what are the views of the Papists? They
   contrive the opus operatum, [84] by which men merit the grace of God;
   and what is this, but to extinguish utterly the truth of the sacrament?
   Baptism and the Lord's supper are retained by us, because it was the
   will of Christ that the use of them should be perpetual; but those
   wicked and foolish notions are rejected by us with the strong
   abhorrence which they deserve.

   4. Christ has become of no effect unto you. "If ye seek any part of
   righteousness in the works of the law, Christ has no concern with you,
   and ye are fallen from grace." They were not so grossly mistaken as to
   believe that by the observance of the law alone they were justified,
   but attempted to mix Christ with the law. In any other point of view,
   Paul's threatenings would have utterly failed to produce alarm. "What
   are you doing? You deprive yourselves of every advantage from Christ,
   and treat his grace as if it were of no value whatever." We see then
   that the smallest part of justification cannot be attributed to the law
   without renouncing Christ and his grace.

   5. For we through the Spirit. He now anticipates an objection that,
   might readily occur. "Will circumcision then be of no use?" In Jesus
   Christ, he replies, it availeth nothing. Righteousness, therefore,
   depends on faith, and is obtained, through the Spirit, without
   ceremonies. To wait for the hope of righteousness, is to place our
   confidence in this or that object, or, to decide from what quarter
   righteousness is to be expected; though the words probably contain the
   exhortation, "Let us continue steadfastly in the hope of righteousness
   which we obtain by faith." When he says that we obtain righteousness by
   faith, this applies equally to us and to our fathers. All of them, as
   Scripture testifies, (Hebrews 11:5,) "pleased God;" but their faith was
   concealed by the veil of ceremonies, and therefore he distinguishes us
   from them by the word Spirit, which is contrasted with outward shadows.
   His meaning therefore is, that all that is now necessary for obtaining
   righteousness is a simple faith, which declines the aid of splendid
   ceremonies, and is satisfied with the spiritual worship of God.

   6. For in Jesus Christ. The reason why believers now wait for the hope
   of righteousness through the Spirit is, that in Christ, that is, in the
   kingdom of Christ, or in the Christian church, circumcision with its
   appendages is abolished; for, by a figure of speech in which a part is
   taken for the whole, the word Circumcision is put for ceremonies. While
   he declares that they no longer possess any influence, he does not
   admit that they were always useless; for he does not maintain that they
   were repealed till after the revelation of Christ. This enables us to
   answer another question, Why does he here speak so contemptuously of
   circumcision, as if it had been of no advantage? The rank which
   circumcision once held as a sacrament is not now considered. The
   question is not what was its value before it had been abolished. But
   under the kingdom of Christ, he pronounces it to be on a level with
   uncircumcision, because the coming of Christ has put an end to legal
   ceremonies.

   But faith, which worketh by love. The contrast here introduced, between
   ceremonies and the exercise of love, was intended to prevent the Jews
   from thinking too highly of themselves, and imagining that they were
   entitled to some superiority; for towards the close of the Epistle,
   instead of this clause, he uses the words, a new creature. (Galatians
   6:15.) As if he had said, Ceremonies are no longer enjoined by Divine
   authority; and, if we abound in the exercise of love, all is well.
   Meanwhile, this does not set aside our sacraments, which are aids to
   faith but is merely a short announcement of what he had formerly taught
   as to the spiritual worship of God.

   There would be no difficulty in this passage, were it not for the
   dishonest manner in which it has been tortured by the Papists to uphold
   the righteousness of works. When they attempt to refute our doctrine,
   that we are justified by faith alone, they take this line of argument.
   If the faith which justifies us be that "which worketh by love," then
   faith alone does not justify. I answer, they do not comprehend their
   own silly talk; still less do they comprehend our statements. It is not
   our doctrine that the faith which justifies is alone; we maintain that
   it is invariably accompanied by good works; only we contend that faith
   alone is sufficient for justification. The Papists themselves are
   accustomed to tear faith after a murderous fashion, sometimes
   presenting it out of all shape and unaccompanied by love, and at other
   times, in its true character. We, again, refuse to admit that, in any
   case, faith can be separated from the Spirit of regeneration; but when
   the question comes to be in what manner we are justified, we then set
   aside all works.

   With respect to the present passage, Paul enters into no dispute
   whether love cooperates with faith in justification; but, in order to
   avoid the appearance of representing Christians as idle and as
   resembling blocks of wood, he points out what are the true exercises of
   believers. When you are engaged in discussing the question of
   justification, beware of allowing any mention to be made of love or of
   works, but resolutely adhere to the exclusive particle. Paul does not
   here treat of justification, or assign any part of the praise of it to
   love. Had he done so, the same argument would prove that circumcision
   and ceremonies, at a former period, had some share in justifying a
   sinner. As in Christ Jesus he commends faith accompanied by love, so
   before the coming of Christ ceremonies were required. But this has
   nothing to do with obtaining righteousness, as the Papists themselves
   allow; and neither must it be supposed that love possesses any such
   influence.

   Galatians 5:7-12

   7. Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
   truth?

   7. Currebatis bene. Quis vos impedivit, ne obediretis veritati?

   8. This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

   8. Persuasio non est ex eo qui vocavit vos.

   9. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

   9. Modicum fermentum totam massam fermentat.

   10. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
   otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,
   whosoever he be.

   10. Ego persuasus sum Deuteronomy vobis in Domino, quod non aliud sitis
   sensuri: qui autem turbat vos, portabit judicium, quisquis sit.

   11. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer
   persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

   11. Ego autem, fratres, si circumcisionem adhuc praedicem, quid adhuc
   persequutionem patior? exinanitum est scandalurn crucis.

   12. I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

   12. Utinam etiam abscindantur, qui vos conturbant.


   7. Ye did run well. The censure which the apostle administers for their
   present departure from the truth is mingled with approbation of their
   former course, for the express purpose that, by being brought to a
   sense of shame, they may return more speedily to the right path. The
   astonishment conveyed in the question, who hindered you? was intended
   to produce a blush. I have chosen to translate the Greek word
   peithsthai, obey, rather than believe, because, having once embraced
   the purity of the gospel, they had been led away from a course of
   obedience.

   8. This persuasion cometh not. Having formerly combated them by
   arguments, he at length pronounces, with a voice of authority, that
   their persuasion came not from God. Such an admonition would not be
   entitled to much regard, were it not supported by the authority of the
   speaker. But Paul, to whom the Galatians had been indebted for the
   announcement of their Divine calling, was well entitled to address them
   in this confident language. This is the reason why he does not directly
   say, from God, but expresses it by a circumlocution, him that hath
   called you [85] As if he had said, "God is never inconsistent with
   himself, and he it is who by my preaching called you to salvation. This
   new persuasion then has come from some other quarter; and if you wish
   to have it thought that your calling is from God, beware of lending an
   ear to those who thrust upon you their new inventions." Though the
   Greek participle kalountos, I acknowledge, is in the present tense, I
   have preferred translating, who hath called you, in order to remove the
   ambiguity.

   9. A little leaven. This refers, I think, to doctrine, not to men. It
   guards them against the mischievous consequences which arise from
   corruption of doctrine, and warns them not to consider it, as is
   commonly done, to be a matter attended by little or no danger. Satan's
   stratagem is, that he does not attempt an avowed destruction of the
   whole gospel, but he taints its purity by introducing false and corrupt
   opinions. Many persons are thus led to overlook the seriousness of the
   injury done, and therefore make a less determined resistance. The
   apostle proclaims aloud that, after the truth of God has been
   corrupted, we are no longer safe. He employs the metaphor of leaven,
   which, however small in quantity, communicates its sourness to the
   whole mass. We must exercise the utmost caution lest we allow any
   counterfeit to be substituted for the pure doctrine of the gospel.

   10. I have confidence in you. All his fierceness is again directed
   against the false apostles. To them the evil is traced, and on them the
   punishment is threatened. Good hopes are expressed regarding the
   Galatians, that they will quickly and readily return to a sincere
   belief. It gives us courage to learn that good hopes are entertained
   about us; for we reckon it shameful to disappoint those whose feelings
   towards us are kind and friendly. But to bring back the Galatians to
   the pure doctrine of faith, from which they had turned aside, was the
   work of God. The apostle says that he has confidence in them, en Kurio,
   through the Lord, by which he reminds them that repentance is a
   heavenly gift, and that they must ask it from God.

   He that troubleth you [86] The sentiment which he had just delivered is
   confirmed by thus indirectly imputing the greater part of the blame to
   those impostors by whom the Galatians had been deceived. From the
   punishment denounced against them, the Galatians are very nearly
   exempted. Let all who introduce confusion into churches, who break the
   unity of faith, who destroy their harmony, lend an ear to this; and if
   they have any right feeling, let them tremble at this word. God
   declares, by the mouth of Paul, that none "through whom such offenses
   come" (Luke 17:1) will pass unpunished. The phrase, whosoever he be, is
   emphatic; for the high sounding language of the false apostles had
   terrified the ignorant multitude. It became necessary for Paul to
   defend his doctrine with corresponding warmth and energy, and not to
   spare any one who dared to raise his voice against it, however eminent
   or however distinguished.

   11. And I, brethren. This argument, is drawn from the final cause. "It
   would be completely in my power," he says, "to avoid the displeasure of
   men, and every kind of danger and persecution, were I only to mix
   ceremonies with Christ. The earnestness with which I oppose them is not
   on my own account, nor for my own advantage." But does it therefore
   follow that his doctrine is true? I answer, proper feelings and pure
   conscience, when manifested by a teacher, have no small share in
   obtaining confidence. Besides, it cannot be believed that any man would
   be so mad as to take measures, of his own accord, for bringing distress
   upon himself. Lastly, he throws upon his adversaries the suspicion,
   that, in preaching circumcision, they were more disposed to consult
   their own ease than to be faithful in the service of Christ. In short,
   Paul was at the farthest remove from ambition, covetousness, or regard
   to personal interest, since he despised favor and applause, and exposed
   himself to the persecutions and fury of the multitude rather than
   swerve a hair's-breadth from the purity of the gospel.

   Then is the offense of the cross ceased. Willingly does Paul, in
   speaking of the gospel, call it the cross, or the preaching of the
   cross, when he wishes to bring its poor, simple style, into contrast
   with the "great swelling words" (Jude 1:16) of human wisdom or
   righteousness. For the Jews, puffed up with an ill-founded confidence
   in their righteousness, and the Greeks, with a foolish belief of their
   wisdom, despised the meanness of the gospel. When therefore he says
   that now, If the preaching of circumcision be admitted, the offense of
   the cross will no longer exist, he means that the gospel will meet with
   no annoyance from the Jews, but will be taught with their entire
   concurrence. And why? Because they will no longer take offense at a
   pretended and spurious gospel, gathered out of Moses and out of Christ,
   but will look with greater indulgence on that mixture which will leave
   them in possession of their former superiority.

   12. Would that they were even cut off. His indignation proceeds still
   farther, and he prays for destruction on those impostors by whom the
   Galatians had been deceived. The word, "cut off," appears to be
   employed in allusion to the circumcision which they pressed. "They tear
   the church for the sake of circumcision: I wish they were entirely cut
   off." Chrysostom favors this opinion. But how can such an imprecation
   be reconciled with the mildness of an apostle, who ought to wish that
   all should be saved, and that not a single person should perish? So far
   as men are concerned, I admit the force of this argument; for it is the
   will of God that we should seek the salvation of all men without
   exception, as Christ suffered for the sins of the whole world. But
   devout minds are sometimes carried beyond the consideration of men, and
   led to fix their eye on the glory of God, and the kingdom of Christ.
   The glory of God, which is in itself more excellent than the salvation
   of men, ought to receive from us a higher degree of esteem and regard.
   Believers earnestly desirous that the glory of God should be promoted,
   forget men, and forget the world, and would rather choose that the
   whole world should perish, than that the smallest portion of the glory
   of God should be withdrawn.

   Let us remember, however, that such a prayer as this proceeds from
   leaving men wholly out of view, and fixing our attention on God alone.
   Paul cannot be accused of cruelty, as if he were opposed to the law of
   love. Besides, if a single man or a few persons be brought into
   comparison, how immensely must the church preponderate! It is a cruel
   kind of mercy which prefers a single man to the whole church. "On one
   side, I see the flock of God in danger; on the other, I see a wolf
   "seeking," like Satan, "whom he may devour." (1 Peter 5:8.) Ought not
   my care of the church to swallow up all my thoughts, and lead me to
   desire that its salvation should be purchased by the destruction of the
   wolf? And yet I would not wish that a single individual should perish
   in this way; but my love of the church and my anxiety about her
   interests carry me away into a sort of ecstasy, so that I can think of
   nothing else." With such zeal as this, every true pastor of the church
   will burn. The Greek word translated "who trouble you," signifies to
   remove from a certain rank or station. By using the word kai, even, he
   expresses more strongly his desire that the impostors should not merely
   be degraded, but entirely separated and cut off. [87]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] "The apostle's statement seems to be, This persuasion to which you
   have yielded is not from Christ. It comes from a very different
   quarter. The men who have employed it are not moved by his spirit. They
   have no divine authority; and you ought not to yield to them, no, not
   for an hour.'" -- Brown.

   [86] "However, he that troubleth you,' or rather, perplexes and
   unsettles you;' as if this was all he could do, -- not teach them. So
   Galen, cited by Wetstein; tarattontes monon tous manthanontas,
   didaskontes de ouden, only troubling the scholars, and teaching them
   nothing.' The use of the singular will not prove that there was no more
   than one false teacher; since it may be used collectively. Yet the
   apostle seems to glance at one, the principal of them; and by hostis an
   e, whosoever he be,' we may infer that he was a person of some
   consequence." -- Bloomfield.

   [87] "But I am so far from inculcating on you the necessity of
   circumcision, I would even wish that all those, without exception, who
   endeavour thus to subvert your faith, were wholly cut off from the
   communion of the Christian church. -- I wish that, instead of having
   hearkened to these seducing teachers, they had been cut off by you,
   excluded from the church, and disowned as brethren.' (See 1 Corinthians
   5:7, 11.) And where he here expresses his wish, that the troublers of
   the Galatians were cut off, it is only putting them in mind what would
   have been both their prudence and their duty to have done; not to have
   hearkened to them, but to have disowned, and refused society with them
   as Christians. This being the plain and natural sense of the apostle's
   words, they cannot be charged with any ill-natured or unfriendly wish."
   -- Chandler.

   Galatians 5:13-18

   13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
   liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

   13. Vos enim in libertatem vocati estis, fratres; tantum ne libertatem
   in occasionem detis carni, sed per charitatem servite vobis invicem.

   14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt
   love thy neighbour as thyself.

   14. Nam tota Lex in uno verbo completur, nempe hoc: Diliges proximum
   tuum sicut to ipsum.

   15. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
   consumed one of another.

   15. Quodsi alius alium vicissim mordetis et devoratis, videte, ne
   vicissim alius ab alio consumamini.

   16. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
   lust of the flesh.

   16. Dico autem: Spiritu ambulate; et concupiscentiam carnis non
   perficietis.

   17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
   the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
   cannot do the things that ye would.

   17. Nam care concupiscit adversus Spiritum; Spiritus antem adversus
   carnem; haec mutuo inter se adversantur; ut non, qnaecunqne volueritis,
   eadem faciails.

   18. But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

   18. Quod si Spiritu ducimini, non estis sub Lege.


   13. Ye have been called to liberty. He now proceeds to show in what way
   liberty must be used. In the course of expounding the First Epistle to
   the Corinthians, we have pointed out that liberty is one thing, and
   that the use of it is another thing. Liberty lies in the conscience,
   and looks to God; the use of it lies in outward matters, and deals not
   with God only, but with men. Having exhorted the Galatians to suffer no
   diminution of their liberty, he now enjoins them to be moderate in the
   use of it, and lays down as a rule for the lawful use, that it shall
   not be turned into pretext or occasion for licentiousness. Liberty is
   not granted to the flesh, which ought rather to be held captive under
   the yoke, but is a spiritual benefit, which none but pious minds are
   capable of enjoying.

   But by love. The method here explained of restraining liberty from
   breaking out into wide and licentious abuse is, to have it regulated by
   love. Let us always remember that the present question is not, in what
   manner we are free before God, but in what manner we may use our
   liberty in our intercourse with men. A good conscience submits to no
   slavery; but to practice outward slavery, or to abstain from the use of
   liberty, is attended by no danger. In a word, if "by love we serve one
   another," we shall always have regard to edification, so that we shall
   not grow wanton, but use the grace of God for his honor and the
   salvation of our neighbors.

   14. For all the law. There is a contrast in this verse, though not
   plainly stated, yet evidently to be understood, between Paul's
   exhortation and the doctrine of the false apostles. While they insisted
   on ceremonies alone, Paul takes a passing glance of the actual duties
   and exercises of Christians. The present commendation of love is
   intended to inform the Galatians, that love forms the chief part of
   Christian perfection. But we must inquire in to the reason why all the
   precepts of the law are included under love. The law consists of two
   tables, the first of which instructs us concerning the worship of God
   and the duties of piety, and the second instructs us concerning the
   love of our neighbor; for it is ridiculous to make a part the same with
   the whole. Some avoid this difficulty by reminding us that the first
   table contains nothing more than to love God with our whole heart. But
   Paul makes express mention of love to our neighbor, and therefore a
   more satisfactory solution must be sought.

   Piety to God, I acknowledge, ranks higher than love of the brethren;
   and therefore the observance of the first table is more valuable in the
   sight of God than the observance of the second. But as God himself is
   invisible, so piety is a thing hidden from the eyes of men; and, though
   the manifestation of it was the purpose for which ceremonies were
   appointed, they are not certain proofs of its existence. It frequently
   happens, that none are more zealous and regular in observing ceremonies
   than hypocrites. God therefore chooses to make trial of our love to
   himself by that love of our brother, which he enjoins us to cultivate.
   This is the reason why, not here only, but in the Epistle to the
   Romans, (Romans 8:8, 13:10,) love is called "the fulfilling of the
   law;" not that it excels, but that it proves the worship of God to be
   real. God, I have said, is invisible; but he represents himself to us
   in the brethren, and in their persons demands what is due to himself.
   Love to men springs only from the fear and love of God; and therefore
   we need not wonder if, by a figure of speech, in which a part is taken
   for the whole, the effect include under it the cause of which it is the
   sign. But it would be wrong in any person to attempt to separate our
   love of God from our love of men.

   Thou shalt love thy neighbor. He who loves will render to every man his
   right, will do injury or harm to no man, will do good, as far as lies
   in his power, to all; for what else is included in the whole of the
   second table? This, too, is the argument employed by Paul in his
   Epistle to the Romans (Romans 13:10.) The word, neighbor, includes all
   men living; for we are linked together by a common nature, as Isaiah
   reminds us, "that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh" (Isaiah
   58:7.) The image of God ought to be particularly regarded as a sacred
   bond of union; but, for that very reason, no distinction is here made
   between friend and foe, nor can the wickedness of men set aside the
   right of nature.

   "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself". The love which men naturally
   cherish toward themselves ought to regulate our love of our neighbor.
   All the doctors of the Sorbonne [88] are in the habit of arguing that,
   as the rule is superior to what it directs, the love of ourselves must
   always hold the first rank. This is not to interpret, but to subvert
   our Lord's words. They are asses, and have not even a spark of the love
   of their neighhour; for if the love of ourselves were the rule, it
   would follow that it is proper and holy, and is the object of the
   divine approbation. But we shall never love our neighbors with
   sincerity, according to our Lord's intention, till we have corrected
   the love of ourselves. The two affections are opposite and
   contradictory; for the love of ourselves leads us to neglect and
   despise others, -- produces cruelty, covetousness, violence, deceit,
   and all kindred vices, -- drives us to impatience, and arms us with the
   desire of revenge. Our Lord therefore enjoins that it be changed into
   the love of our neighbor.

   15. But if ye bite and devour one another. From the nature of the
   subject, as well as from the language employed, we may conjecture that
   the Galatians had disputes among themselves; for they differed about
   doctrine. The apostle now demonstrates, from the result, how
   destructive such proceedings in the church must ultimately prove to be.
   False doctrine was probably a judgment from heaven upon their ambition,
   pride, and other offenses. This may be concluded from what frequently
   happens in the divine dispensations, as well as from an express
   declaration by the hand of Moses.

   "Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer
   of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love
   the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul."
   (Deuteronomy 13:3.)

   By biting and devouring [89] he means, I think, slanders, accusations,
   reproaches, and every other kind of offensive language, as well as acts
   of injustice arising either from fraud or violence. And what is the end
   of them? To be consumed, while the tendency of brotherly love is to
   produce mutual protection and kindness. I wish we could always
   remember, when the devil tempts us to disputes, that the disagreement
   of members within the church can lead to nothing else than the ruin and
   consumption of the whole body. How distressing, how mad is it, that we,
   who are members of the same body, should be leagued together, of our
   own accord, for mutual destruction!

   16. This I say then. Now follows the remedy. The ruin of the church is
   no light evil, and whatever threatens it must be opposed with the most
   determined resistance. But how is this to be accomplished? By not
   permitting the flesh to rule in us, and by yielding ourselves to the
   direction of the Spirit of God. The Galatians are indirectly told, that
   they are carnal, destitute of the Spirit of God, and that the life
   which they lead is unworthy of Christians; for whence did their violent
   conduct towards each other proceed, but from their being guided by the
   lust of the flesh? This, he tells them, is an evidence that they do not
   walk according to the Spirit.

   Ye shall not fulfill. We ought to mark the word fulfill; by which he
   means, that, though the sons of God, so long as they groan under the
   burden of the flesh, are liable to commit sin, they are not its
   subjects or slaves, but make habitual opposition to its power. The
   spiritual man may be frequently assaulted by the lusts of the flesh,
   but fulfill them, -- he does not permit them to reign over him. -- On
   this subject, it will be proper to consult the eighth chapter of the
   Epistle to the Romans

   17. For the flesh lusteth. The spiritual life maintained without a
   struggle. We are here informed of the nature of the difficulty, which
   arises from our natural inclinations being opposed to the Spirit. The
   word flesh, as we had occasion to observe, in expounding the Epistle to
   the Romans, denotes the nature of man; for the limited application of
   it, which the sophists make to the lower senses, as they are called, is
   refuted by various passages; and the contrast between the two words
   puts an end to all doubt. The Spirit denotes the renewed nature, or the
   grace of regeneration; and what else does the flesh mean, but "the old
   man?" (Romans 6:6 Ephesians 4:22 Colossians 3:9.) Disobedience and
   rebellion against the Spirit of God pervade the whole nature of man. If
   we would obey the Spirit, we must labor, and fight, and apply our
   utmost energy; and we must begin with self-denial. The compliment paid
   by our Lord to the natural inclinations of men, amounts to this, --
   that there is no greater agreement between them and righteousness, than
   between fire and water. Where, then, shall we find a drop of goodness
   in man's free will? unless we pronounce that to be good which is
   contrary to the Spirit of God;

   "because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject
   to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
   (Romans 8:7.)

   All the thoughts of the flesh are acts of enmity against God.

   So that ye cannot do the things that ye would. This refers,
   unquestionably, to the regenerate. Carnal men have no battle with
   depraved lusts, no proper desire to attain to the righteousness of God.
   Paul is addressing believers. The things that ye would must mean, not
   our natural inclinations, but the holy affections which God bestows
   upon us by his grace. Paul therefore declares, that believers, so long
   as they are in this life, whatever may be the earnestness of their
   endeavors, do not obtain such a measure of success as to serve God in a
   perfect manner. The highest result does not correspond to their wishes
   and desires. I must again refer the reader, for a more extended view of
   my sentiments on this subject, to the Exposition of the Epistle to the
   Romans, (See Calvin on Romans 7:15.)

   18. But if ye be led by the Spirit. In the way of the Lord believers
   are apt to stumble. But let them not be discouraged, because they are
   unable to satisfy the demands of the law. Let them listen to the
   consolatory declaration of the apostle, which is also found in other
   parts of his writings, (Romans 6:14,) ye are not under the law. Hence
   it follows, that the performance of their duties is not rejected on
   account of their present defects, but is accepted in the sight of God,
   as if it had been in every respect perfect and complete. Paul is still
   pursuing the controversy about freedom. The Spirit is elsewhere (Romans
   8:15) denominated by him, "the Spirit of adoption;" and when the Spirit
   makes men free, he emancipates them from the yoke of the law. As if he
   had said, "Is it your desire instantly to terminate the controversies
   in which you are now engaged? Walk according to the Spirit. You will
   then be free from the dominion of the law, which will act only in the
   capacity of a kind adviser, and will no longer lay a restraint upon
   your consciences." Besides, when the condemnation of the law is
   removed, freedom from ceremonies follows as a necessary consequence;
   for ceremonies mark the condition of a slave.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] The College of the Sorbonne, in Paris, takes its name from Robert
   de Serbonne, who founded it in the middle of the thirteenth century.
   Its reputation for theological learning, philosophy, classical
   literature, and all that formerly constituted a liberal education, was
   deservedly high. In the Doctors of the Sorbonne the Reformation found
   powerful adversaries. The very name of this university, to which the
   greatest scholars in Europe were accustomed to pay deference, would be
   regarded by the multitude with blind veneration. If such men as Calvin,
   Beza, Melanchthon, and Luther, were prepared by talents and
   acquirements of the first order to brave the terrors of that name, they
   must have frequently lamented its influence on many of their hearers.
   Yet our author meets undaunted this formidable array, and enters the
   field with the full assurance of victory. Despising, as we naturally
   do, the weak superstitions and absurd tenets held by the Church of
   Rome, we are apt to underrate our obligations to the early champions of
   the Reformed faith, who encountered, with success, those veteran
   warriors, and contended earnestly for the faith which was once
   delivered to the saints.' (Jude 1:3.)" -- Ed.

   Galatians 5:19-21

   19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery,
   fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

   19. Manifesta vero sunt opera carnis, quae sunt adulterium, scortatio,
   immunditia, lascivia,

   20. Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
   seditions, heresies,

   20. Idololatria, veneficium, inimicitiae, contentio, aemulationes,
   irae, concertationes, seditiones, haereses,

   21. Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the
   which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that
   they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

   21. Invidiae, homicidia, ebrietates, comissationes, et his similia;
   Deuteronomy quibus praedico vobis, quemadmodum et praedixi, quod qui
   talia agunt regnum Dei haereditate non possidebunt.


   19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest. To obey the spirit and to
   oppose the flesh, are two great objects which have been set before
   Christians, and for the attainment of which they have been urged to
   make the most strenuous exertions. In accordance with these views, he
   now draws a picture both of the flesh and of the spirit. If men knew
   themselves, they would not need this inspired declaration, for they are
   nothing but flesh; but such is the hypocrisy belonging to our natural
   state, we never perceive our depravity till the tree has been fully
   made known by its fruits. (Matthew 7:16; Luke 6:44.)

   The apostle therefore now points out to us those sins against which we
   must fight, in order that we may not live according to the flesh. He
   does not indeed enumerate them all, and so he himself states at the
   conclusion of the list; but from those brought forward, the character
   of the remainder may be easily ascertained. Adultery and fornication
   are placed first, and next follows uncleanness, which extends to every
   species of unchastity. Lasciviousness appears to be a subsidiary term,
   for the Greek word aselgeia, which is thus translated, is applied to
   those who lead wanton and dissolute lives. These four denote sins
   forbidden by the seventh commandment. The next mentioned is idolatry,
   which is here employed as a general term for services grossly
   superstitious and openly practiced.

   Seven classes which immediately follow, are closely allied, and another
   two are afterwards added. Anger and hatred differ chiefly in this, that
   anger is short, and hatred is lasting. Emulations and envyings are the
   occasions of hatred; and the following distinction between them is
   stated by Aristotle, in his second book on Rhetoric: -- He who emulates
   is grieved that another should excel him, not because the virtue or
   worth of that person, in itself considered, gives him uneasiness, but
   because he would wish to be superior. The envious man has no desire to
   excel, but is grieved at the excellence of other men. None, therefore,
   he tells us, but low and mean persons indulge in envy, while emulation
   dwells in lofty and heroic minds. Paul declares both to be diseases of
   the flesh. From anger and hatred arise variance, strife, seditions; and
   he even traces the consequences so far as to mention murders and
   witchcraft [90] By revellings, [91] he means a dissolute life, and
   every kind of intemperance in the gratification of the palate. It
   deserves notice, that heresies are enumerated among the works of the
   flesh; for it shows clearly that the word flesh is not confined, as the
   sophists imagine, to sensuality. What produces heresies but ambition,
   which deals not with the lower senses, but with the highest faculties
   of the mind? He says that these works are manifest, so that no man may
   think that he will gain anything by evading the question; [92] for what
   avails it to deny that the flesh reigns in us, if the fruit betrays the
   quality of the tree?

   21. Of which I tell you before. By this awful threatening he intended
   not only to alarm the Galatians, but likewise to glance indirectly at
   the false apostles, who had laid aside the far more valuable
   instruction, and spent their time in disputing about ceremonies. He
   instructs us, by his example, to press those exhortations and
   threatenings, agreeably to the words of the prophet,

   "Cry aloud, spare not; proclaim to my people their sins."
   (Isaiah 58:1)

   What can be conceived more dreadful than that men should walk after the
   flesh, and shut themselves out from the kingdom of God? Who will dare
   to treat lightly the "abominable things which God hates?" (Jeremiah
   44:4.)

   But in this way, we shall be told, all are cut off from the hope of
   salvation; for who is there that is not chargeable with some of those
   sins? I reply, Paul does not threaten that all who have sinned, but
   that all who remain impenitent, shall be excluded from the kingdom of
   God. The saints themselves often fall into grievous sins, but they
   return to the path of righteousness, "that which they do they allow
   not," (Romans 7:15,) and therefore they are not included in this
   catalogue. All threatenings of the judgments of God call us to
   repentance. They are accompanied by a promise that those who repent
   will obtain forgiveness; but if we continue obstinate, they remain as a
   testimony from heaven against us.

   They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The word
   kleronomein signifies to possess by hereditary right; for by no right
   but that of adoption, as we have seen in other passages, do we obtain
   eternal life.

   which were carried on by poisonous intoxicating draughts and ointments,
   by which they did great mischief to the bodies of men. As it is here
   immediately placed after idolatry, I should imagine that the apostle
   intended those cursed arts of incantations and charms, those various
   methods of imposture and cheats, which were made use of by the heathen
   priests, to promote the idolatrous reverence and worship of their false
   gods. (See Revelation 18:23.)" -- Chandler.

   Galatians 5:22-26

   22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
   gentleness, goodness, faith,

   22. Fructus vero Spiritus est charitas, gaudium, pax, tolerantia,
   comitas, benignitas, fides,

   23. Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

   23. Mansuetudo, temperantia: adversus ejusmodi non est Lex.

   24. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
   affections and lusts.

   24. Qui autem Christi sunt carnem crucifixerunt cum affectibus et
   concupiscentiis.

   25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

   25. Si vivimus Spiritu, etiam Spiritu ambulemus.

   26. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
   envying one another.

   26. Ne sinms inanis gloriae cupidi, invicem provocantes, invicem
   invidentes.


   22. But the fruit [93] of the Spirit. In the former part of the
   description he condemned the whole nature of man as producing nothing
   but evil and worthless fruits. He now informs us that all virtues, all
   proper and well regulated affections, proceed from the Spirit, that is,
   from the grace of God, and the renewed nature which we derive from
   Christ. As if he had said, "Nothing but what is evil comes from man;
   nothing good comes but from the Holy Spirit." There have often appeared
   in unrenewed men remarkable instances of gentleness, integrity,
   temperance, and generosity; but it is certain that all were but
   specious disguises. Curius and Fabrieius were distinguished for
   courage, Cato for temperance, Scipio for kindness and generosity,
   Fabius for patience; but it was only in the sight of men, and as
   members of civil society, that they were so distinguished. In the sight
   of God nothing is pure but what proceeds from the fountain of all
   purity.

   Joy does not here, I think, denote that "joy in the Holy Ghost" (Romans
   14:17,) of which he speaks elsewhere, but that cheerful behavior
   towards our fellow-men which is the opposite of moroseness. Faith means
   truth, and is contrasted with cunning, deceit, and falsehood, as peace
   is with quarrels and contentions. Long-suffering is gentleness of mind,
   which disposes us to take everything in good part, and not to be easily
   offended. The other terms require no explanation, for the dispositions
   of the mind must be learned from the outward conduct.

   But if spiritual men are known by their works, what judgment, it will
   be asked, shall we form of wicked men and idolaters, who exhibited an
   illustrious resemblance of all the virtues? for it is evident from
   their works that they were spiritual. I reply, as all the works of the
   flesh do not appear openly in a carnal man, but his carnaltry is
   discovered by one or another vice, so a single virtue will not entitle
   us to conclude that a man is spiritual. Sometimes it will be made
   evident, by other vices, that sin reigns in him; and this observation
   may be easily applied to all the cases which I have enumerated.

   23. Against such there is no law. Some understand these words as
   meaning simply that the law is not directed against good works, "from
   evil manners have sprung good laws." But Paul's real meaning is deeper
   and less obvious; namely, that, where the Spirit reigns, the law has no
   longer any dominion. By moulding our hearts to his own righteousness,
   the Lord delivers us from the severity of the law, so that our
   intercourse with himself is not regulated by its covenant, nor our
   consciences bound by its sentence of condemnation. Yet the law
   continues to teach and exhort, and thus performs its own office; but
   our subjection to it is withdrawn by the Spirit of adoption. He thus
   ridicules the false apostles, who, while they enforced subjection to
   the law, were not less eager to release themselves from its yoke. The
   only way, he tells us, in which this is accomplished, is, when the
   Spirit of God obtains dominion, from which we are led to conclude that
   they had no proper regard to spiritual righteousness.

   24. And they that are Christ's. He adds this, in order to show that all
   Christians have renounced the flesh, and therefore enjoy freedom. While
   he makes this statement, the apostle reminds the Galatians what true
   Christianity is, so far as relates to the life, and thus guards them
   against a false profession of Christianity. The word crucified is
   employed to point out that the mortification of the flesh is the effect
   of the cross of Christ. This work does not belong to man. By the grace
   of Christ

   "we have been planted together in the likeness of his death" (Romans
   6:5,)

   that we no longer might live unto ourselves. If we are buried with
   Christ, by true self-denial, and by the destruction of the old man, we
   shall then enjoy the privilege of the sons of God. The flesh is not yet
   indeed entirely destroyed; but it has no right to exercise dominion,
   and ought to yield to the Spirit. The flesh and its lusts are a figure
   of speech of exactly the same import with the tree and its fruits. The
   flesh itself is the depravity of corrupt nature, from which all evil
   actions proceed. (Matthew 15:19; Mark 7:21.) Hence it follows, that the
   members of Christ have cause to complain, if they are still held to be
   in bondage to the law, from which all who have been regenerated by his
   Spirit are set free.

   25. If we live in the Spirit. According to his usual custom, the
   apostle draws from the doctrine a practical exhortation. The death of
   the flesh is the life of the Spirit. If the Spirit of God lives in us,
   let him govern our actions. There will always be many persons daring
   enough to make a false boast of living in the Spirit, but the apostle
   challenges them to a proof of the fact. As the soul does not remain
   idle in the body, but gives motion and rigour to every member and part,
   so the Spirit of God cannot dwell in us without manifesting himself by
   the outward effects. By the life is here meant the inward power, and by
   the walk the outward actions. The metaphorical use of the word walk,
   which frequently occurs, describes works as evidences of the spiritual
   life.

   26. Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, The special exhortations
   which were addressed to the Galatians were not more necessary for them
   than they are adapted to our own time. Of many evils existing in
   society at large, and particularly in the church, ambition is the
   mother. Paul therefore directs us to guard against it, for the
   vain-glory (kenodoxia) of which he speaks is nothing else than
   ambition, (filimia,) or the desire of honor, by which every one desires
   to excel all others. The heathen philosophers do not condemn every
   desire of glory; but among Christians, whoever is desirous of glory
   departs from true glory, and therefore is justly charged with idle and
   foolish ambition. It is not lawful for us to glow but in God alone.
   Every other kind of glorying is pure vanity. Mutual provocations and
   envyings are the daughters of ambition. He who aspires to the highest
   rank must of necessity envy all others, and disrespectful, biting,
   stinging language is the unavoidable consequence.

   Galatians 6:1-5

   1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
   restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,
   lest thou also be tempted.

   1. Fratres, etiamsi praeoccupatus fuerit homo in aliquo lapsu, vos, qui
   spirituales estis, instaurate ejusmodi hominem spiritu lenitatis;
   considerans to ipsum, ne tu quoque tenteris.

   2. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

   2. Alii aliorum onera portate, et sic adimplete legem Christi.

   3. For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
   deceiveth himself.

   3. Nam si quis putat se esse aliquid, quum nihil sit, se ipsum decipit.

   4. But let every man prove his own worth, and then shall he have
   rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

   4. Opus antem suum probet unusquisque; et tunc in se ipso solo gloriam
   habebit, non antem in alio.

   5. For every man shall bear his own burden.

   5. Quisque enim proprium onus portabit.


   1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault [94] Ambition is a
   serious and alarming evil. But hardly less injury is frequently done by
   unseasonable and excessive severity, which, under the plausible name of
   zeal, springs in many instances from pride, and from dislike and
   contempt of the brethren. Most men seize on the faults of brethren as
   an occasion of insulting them, and of using reproachful and cruel
   language. Were the pleasure they take in upbraiding equalled by their
   desire to produce amendment, they would act in a different manner.
   Reproof, and often sharp and severe reproof, must be administered to
   offenders. But while we must not shrink from a faithful testimony
   against sin, neither must we omit to mix oil with the vinegar.

   We are here taught to correct the faults of brethren in a mild manner,
   and to consider no rebukes as partaking a religious and Christian
   character which do not breathe the spirit of meekness. To gain this
   object, he explains the design of pious reproofs, which is, to restore
   him who is fallen, to place him in his former condition. That design
   will never be accomplished by violence, or by a disposition to accuse,
   or by fierceness of manner or language; and consequently, we must
   display a gentle and meek spirit, if we intend to heal our brother. And
   lest any man should satisfy himself with assuming the outward form, he
   demands the spirit of meekness; for no man is prepared for chastising a
   brother till he has succeeded in acquiring a gentle spirit. [95]

   Another argument for gentleness in correcting brethren is contained in
   the expression, "if a man be overtaken." If he has been carried away
   through want of consideration, or through the cunning arts of a
   deceiver, it would be cruel to treat such a man with harshness. Now, we
   know that the devil is always lying in wait, and has a thousand ways of
   leading us astray. When we perceive a brother to have transgressed, let
   us consider that he has fallen into the snares of Satan; let us be
   moved with compassion, and prepare our minds to exercise forgiveness.
   But offenses and falls of this description must undoubtedly be
   distinguished from deep seated crimes, accompanied by deliberate and
   obstinate disregard of the authority of God. Such a display of wicked
   and perverse disobedience to God must be visited with greater severity,
   for what advantage would be gained by gentle treatment? The particle if
   also, (ea`n kai,) implies that not only the weak who have been tempted,
   but those who have yielded to temptation, shall receive forbearance.

   Ye who are spiritual. This is not spoken in irony; for, however
   spiritual they might be, still they were not wholly filled with the
   Spirit. It belongs to such persons to raise up the fallen. To what
   better purpose can their superior attainments be applied than to
   promote the salvation of the brethren? The more eminently any man is
   endowed with Divine grace, the more strongly is he bound to consult the
   edification of those who have been less favored. But such is our folly,
   that in our best duties we are apt to fail, and therefore need the
   exhortation which the apostle gives to guard against the influence of
   carnal views.

   Considering thyself. It is not without reason that the apostle passes
   from the plural to the singular number. He gives weight to his
   admonition, when he addresses each person individually, and bids him
   look carefully into himself. "Whoever thou art that takest upon thee
   the office of reproving others, look to thyself." Nothing is more
   difficult than to bring us to acknowledge or examine our own weakness.
   Whatever may be our acuteness in detecting the faults of others, we do
   not see, as the saying is, "the wallet that hangs behind our own back;"
   [96] and therefore, to arouse us to greater activity, he employs the
   singular number.

   These words may admit of two senses. As we acknowledge that we are
   liable to sin, we more willingly grant that forgiveness to others
   which, in our turn, we expect will be extended to us. Some interpret
   them in this manner: "Thou who art a sinner, and needest the compassion
   of thy brethren, oughtest not to show thyself fierce and implacable to
   others." [97] But I would rather choose to expound them as a warning
   given by Paul, that, in correcting others, we should not ourselves
   commit sin. There is a danger here which deserves our most careful
   attention, and against which it is difficult to guard; for nothing is
   more easy than to exceed the proper limits. The word tempt, however,
   may very properly be taken in this passage as extended to the whole
   life. Whenever we have occasion to pronounce censure, let us begin with
   ourselves, and, remembering our own weakness, let us be indulgent to
   others.

   2. Bear ye one another's burdens. The weaknesses or sins, under which
   we groan, are called burdens. This phrase is singularly appropriate in
   an exhortation to kind behavior, for nature dictates to us that those
   who bend under a burden ought to be relieved. He enjoins us to bear the
   burdens. We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren
   are pressed down, but relieve them, -- which can only be done by mild
   and friendly correction. There are many adulterers and thieves, many
   wicked and abandoned characters of every description, who would
   willingly make Christ an accomplice in their crimes. All would choose
   to lay upon believers the task of bearing their burdens. But as the
   apostle had immediately before exhorted us to restore a brother, the
   manner in which Christians are required to bear one another's burdens
   cannot be mistaken.

   And so fulfill the law of Christ. The word law, when applied here to
   Christ, serves the place of an argument. There is an implied contrast
   between the law of Christ and the law of Moses. "If you are very
   desirous to keep a law, Christ enjoins on you a law which you are bound
   to prefer to all others, and that is, to cherish kindness towards each
   other. He who has not this has nothing. On the other hand, he tells us,
   that, when every one compassionately assists his neighbor, the law of
   Christ is fulfilled; by which he intimates that every thing which does
   not proceed from love is superfluous; for the composition of the Greek
   word anaplerosate, conveys the idea of what is absolutely perfect. But
   as no man performs in every respect what Paul requires, we are still at
   a distance from perfection. He who comes the nearest to it with regard
   to others, is yet far distant with respect to God.

   3. For if a man think himself. There is an ambiguity in the
   construction, but Paul's meaning is clear. The phrase, When he is
   nothing, appears at first view to mean, "if any person, who is in
   reality nothing, claims to be something;" as there are many men of no
   real worth who are elated by a foolish admiration of themselves. But
   the meaning is more general, and may be thus expressed: "Since all men
   are nothing, he who wishes to appear something, and persuades himself
   that he is somebody, deceives himself." First, then, he declares that
   we are nothing, by which he means, that we have nothing of our own of
   which we have a right to boast, but are destitute of every thing good:
   so that all our glorying is mere vanity. Secondly, he infers that they
   who claim something as their own deceive themselves. Now, since nothing
   excites our indignation more than that others should impose upon us, it
   argues the height of folly that we should willingly impose upon
   ourselves. This consideration will render us much more candid to
   others. Whence proceeds fierce insult or haughty sternness, but from
   this, that every one exalts himself in his own estimation, and proudly
   despises others? Let arrogance be removed, and we shall all discover
   the greatest modesty in our conduct towards each other.

   4. But let every man prove his own work. By a powerful blow, Paul has
   already struck down the pride of man. But it frequently happens that,
   by comparing ourselves with others, the low opinion which we form of
   them leads us to entertain a high opinion of ourselves. Paul declares
   that no such comparison ought to be allowed. Let no man, he says,
   measure himself by the standard of another, or please himself with the
   thought, that others appear to him less worthy of approbation. Let him
   lay aside all regard to other men, examine his own conscience, and
   inquire what is his own work. It is not what we gain by detracting from
   others, but what we have without any comparison, that can be regarded
   as true praise.

   Some consider Paul to be speaking in irony. "Thou flatterest thyself by
   a comparison with the faults of others; but if thou wilt consider who
   thou art, thou wilt then enjoy the praise which is justly due to thee."
   In other words, no praise whatever shall be thine; because there is no
   man by whom the smallest portion of praise is really deserved. In
   conformity with this view, the words that follow, every man shall bear
   his own burden, are supposed to mean, that it is usual for every man to
   bear his own burden. But the plain and direct sense of the words agrees
   better with the apostle's reasoning. "With respect to thyself alone,
   and not by comparison with others, thou wilt have praise." I am well
   aware that the next sentence, which annihilates all the glory of man,
   has been regarded as justifying the ironical interpretation. But the
   glorying of which this passage treats, is that of a good conscience, in
   which the Lord allows his people to indulge, and which Paul elsewhere
   expresses in very animated language.

   "Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have
   lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
   (Acts 23:1.)

   This is nothing more than an acknowledgment of Divine grace, which
   reflects no praise whatever on man, but excites him to give God the
   glory. Such a reason for glorying do the godly find in themselves; and
   they ascribe it, not to their own merits, but to the riches of the
   grace of God.

   "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of a good conscience, that in
   simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
   grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world."
   (2 Corinthians 1:12.)

   Our Lord himself instructs us:

   "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast
   shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who
   seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."
   (Matthew 6:6.)

   Strictly speaking, he makes no assertion, but leads us to conclude,
   that, when a man is valued for his own worth, and not for the baseness
   of others, the praise is just and substantial. The statement is
   therefore conditional, and imports that none are entitled to be
   regarded as good men, who are not found to be so, apart from the
   consideration of others.

   5. For every man shall bear his own burdens. To destroy sloth and
   pride, he brings before us the judgment of God, in which every
   individual for himself, and without a comparison with others, will give
   an account of his life. It is thus that we are deceived; for, if a man
   who has but one eye is placed among the blind, he considers his vision
   to be perfect; and a tawny person among negroes thinks himself white.
   The apostle affirms that the false conclusions to which we are thus
   conducted will find no place in the judgment of God; because there
   every one will bear his own burden, and none will stand acquitted by
   others from their own sins. This is the true meaning of the words.

   Galatians 6:6-10

   6. Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
   teacheth in all good things.

   6. Coremunicet is, qui instituitur in sermone, cum doctore, in omnibus
   bonis.

   7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
   that shall he also reap.

   7. Ne erretis: Deus non subsannatur; quod enim seminaverit homo, hoc
   etiam metet.

   8. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;
   but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
   everlasting.

   8. Nam qui seminat carni suae, ex carne metet corruptionem; qui autem
   seminat Spiritui, ex Spiritu metet vitam aeternam.

   9. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
   reap, if we faint not.

   9. Bonum antem faciendo ne defatigemur; nam si non defecerimus, metemus
   opportuno tempore.

   10. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
   especially unto them who are of the household of faith..

   10. Ergo ubi tempus habemus, benefaciamus erga omnes, praesertim vero
   erga domesticos fidel.


   6. Let him that is taught in the word. It is probable that the teachers
   and ministers of the word were at that time neglected. This shewed the
   basest ingratitude. How disgraceful is it to defraud of their temporal
   support those by whom our souls are fed! -- to refuse an earthly
   recompense to those from whom we receive heavenly benefits! But it is,
   and always has been, the disposition of the world, freely to bestow on
   the ministers of Satan every luxury, and hardly to supply godly pastors
   with necessary food. Though it does not become us to indulge too much
   in complaint, or to be too tenacious of our rights, yet Paul found
   himself called upon to exhort the Galatians to perform this part of
   their duty. He was the more ready to do so, because he had no private
   interest in the matter, but consulted the universal benefit of the
   Church, without any regard to his own advantage. He saw that the
   ministers of the word were neglected, because the word itself was
   despised; for if the word be truly esteemed, its ministers will always
   receive kind and honorable treatment. It is one of the tricks of Satan
   to defraud godly ministers of support, that the Church may be deprived
   of such ministers. [98] An earnest desire to preserve a gospel
   ministry, led to Paul's recommendation that proper attention should be
   paid to good and faithful pastors.

   The word is here put, by way of eminence, (kat ' exochen,) for the
   doctrine of godliness. Support is declared to be due to those by whom
   we are taught in the word. Under this designation the Papal system
   supports idle bellies of dumb men, and fierce wild beasts, who have
   nothing in common with the doctrine of Christ. In all good things. He
   does not propose that no limit should be set to their worldly
   enjoyments, or that they should revel in superfluous abundance, but
   merely that none of the necessary supports of life should be withheld.
   Ministers ought to be satisfied with moderate fare, and the danger
   which attends pomp and luxury ought to be prevented. To supply their
   real necessities, let believers cheerfully devote any part of their
   property that may be required for the services of devout and holy
   teachers. What return will they make for the invaluable treasure of
   eternal life, which is communicated to them by the preaching of those
   men?

   7. God is not mocked. The design of this observation is to reply to the
   dishonest excuses which are frequently pleaded. One alleges that he has
   a family to support, and another asserts that he has no superfluity of
   wealth to spend in liberality or profusion. The consequence is, that,
   while such multitudes withhold their aid, the few persons who do their
   duty are generally unable to contribute the necessary support. These
   apologies Paul utterly rejects, for a reason which the world little
   considers, that this transaction is with God. The supply of a man's
   bodily wants is not the sole question, but involves the degree of our
   regard for Christ and his gospel. This passage contains evidence that
   the custom of treating faithful ministers with scorn did not originate
   in the present day; but their wicked taunts will not pass unpunished.

   For whatsoever a man soweth. Our liberality is restrained by the
   supposition, that whatever passes into the hands of another is lost to
   ourselves, and by the alarm we feel about our own prospects in life.
   Paul meets these views by a comparison drawn from seed-time, which, he
   tells us, is a fit representation of acts of beneficence. On this
   subject we had occasion to speak, in expounding the Second Epistle to
   the Corinthians, where the same metaphor was employed. Happy would it
   be for us, if this truth were deeply impressed upon our minds. How
   "very gladly" would we "spend and be spent" (2 Corinthians 12:15) for
   the good of our neighbours, encouraged by the hope of the coming
   harvest! No operation is more cheerfully performed by husbandmen than
   throwing the seed into the ground. They are enabled to wait with
   patience during nine months of the year, by the expectation of reaping
   a corruptible harvest, while our minds are not properly affected by the
   hope of a blessed immortality.

   8. For he that soweth to his flesh. Having stated the general
   sentiment, he now divides it into parts. To sow to the flesh, is to
   look forward to the wants of the present life, without any regard to a
   future life. They who do this will gather fruit corresponding to the
   seed which they have sown, -- will heap up that which shall miserably
   perish. To sow in the flesh, (seminare in carne,) is supposed by some
   to mean indulgence in the lusts of the flesh, and corruption to mean
   destruction; but the former exposition agrees better with the context.
   In departing from the old translation and from Erasmus, I have not
   acted rashly. The Greek words, ho speiron eis ten sarka heautou,
   literally signify, he that soweth into his flesh. And what else does
   this mean, but to be so entirely devoted to the flesh, as to direct all
   our thoughts to its interests or convenience?

   But he that soweth to the spirit. By the spirit I understand the
   spiritual life, to which they are said to sow whose views are directed
   more to heaven than to earth, and whose life is regulated by the desire
   of reaching the kingdom of God. From their spiritual employments they
   will reap in heaven incorruptible fruit. Those employments are
   denominated spiritual on account of their end, though in some respects
   they are external and relate to the body, as in the very case now under
   consideration of supporting pastors. If the Papists shall endeavor, in
   their usual manner, to build upon these words the righteousness of
   works, we have already shewn how easily their absurdities may be
   exposed. Though eternal life is a reward, it does not follow either
   that we are justified by works, or that works are meritorious of
   salvation. The undeserved kindness of God appears in the very act of
   honoring the works which his grace has enabled us to perform, by
   promising to them a reward to which they are not entitled.

   Is a more complete solution of the question demanded?

   1. We have no good works which God rewards but those which we derive
   from his grace.

   2. The good works which we perform by the guidance and direction of the
   Holy Spirit, are the fruits of that adoption which is an act of free
   grace.

   3. They are not only unworthy of the smallest and most inconsiderable
   reward, but deserve to be wholly condemned, because they are always
   stained by many blemishes; and what have pollutions to do with the
   presence of God?

   4. Though a reward had been a thousand times promised to works, yet it
   is not due but by fulfilling the condition of obeying the law
   perfectly; and how widely distant are we all from that perfection!

   Let Papists now go and attempt to force their way into heaven by the
   merit of works. We cheerfully concur with Paul and with the whole Bible
   in acknowledging, that we are unable to do anything but by the free
   grace of God, and yet that the benefits resulting from our works
   receive the name of a reward.

   9. Let us not be weary in well-doing. Well-doing (kalon) does not
   simply mean doing our duty, but the performance of acts of kindness,
   and has a reference to men. We are instructed not to be weary in
   assisting our neighbours, in performing good offices, and in exercising
   generosity. This precept is highly necessary; for we are naturally
   reluctant to discharge the duties of brotherly love, and many
   unpleasant occurrences arise by which the ardor of the best disposed
   persons is apt to be cooled. We meet with many unworthy and many
   ungrateful persons. The vast number of necessitous cases overwhelms us,
   and the applications which crowd upon us from every quarter exhaust our
   patience. Our warmth is abated by the coolness of other men. In short,
   the world presents innumerable hinderances, which tend to lead us aside
   from the right path. Most properly, therefore, does Paul admonish us
   not to relax through weariness.

   If we faint not. That is, we shall reap the fruit which God promises,
   if we "persevere to the end." (Matthew 10:22.) Those who do not
   persevere resemble indolent husbandmen, who, after ploughing and
   sowing, leave the work unfinished, and neglect to take the necessary
   precautions for protecting the seed from being devoured by birds, or
   scorched by the sun, or destroyed by cold. It is to no purpose that we
   begin to do good, if we do not press forward to the goal.

   In due season [99] Let no man, from a wish to gather the fruit in this
   life, or before its proper time, deprive himself of the spiritual
   harvest. The desires of believers must be both supported and restrained
   by the exercise of hope and patience.

   10. While we have opportunity. The metaphor is still pursued. Every
   season is not adapted to tillage and sowing. Active and prudent
   husbandmen will observe the proper season, and will not indolently
   allow it to pass unimproved. Since, therefore, God has set apart the
   whole of the present life for ploughing and sowing, let us avail
   ourselves of the season, lest, through our negligence, it may be taken
   out of our power. Beginning with liberality to ministers of the gospel,
   Paul now makes a wider application of his doctrine, and exhorts us to
   do good to all men, but recommends to our particular regard the
   household of faith, or believers, because they belong to the same
   family with ourselves. This similitude is intended to excite us to that
   kind of communication which ought to be maintained among the members of
   one family. There are duties which we owe to all men arising out of a
   common nature; but the tie of a more sacred relationship, established
   by God himself, binds us to believers.

   Galatians 6:11-13

   11. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
   hand.

   11. Videtis, qualibus literis vobis scripserim mea manu.

   12. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain
   you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the
   cross of Christ.

   12. Quicunque volunt placere juxta faciem in carne, hi cogunt vos
   circumcidi; tantum ut ne persequutionem sustineant cruce Christi.

   13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
   desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

   13. Neque enim qui circumciduntur, ipsi Legera servant; sed volunt vos
   circumcidi, ut in carne vestra glorientur.


   11. Ye see. The meaning of the Greek verb idete, is so far doubtful
   that it may be taken either in the imperative or indicative mood; but
   the force of the passage is little if at all affected. To convince the
   Galatians more fully of his anxiety about them, and at the same time to
   ensure their careful perusal, he mentions that this long Epistle had
   been written with his own hand. The greater the toil to which he had
   submitted on their account, the stronger were their inducements to read
   it, not in a superficial manner, but with the closest attention.

   12. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh. Such men pay no
   regard to edification, but are guided by an ambitious desire to hunt
   after popular applause. The Greek verb euprosoposai, [100] is highly
   expressive, and denotes the kind looks and address which were assumed
   for the purpose of pleasing. He charges the false apostles with
   ambition. As if he had said, "When those men lay circumcision upon you
   as a necessary burden, do you wish to know what sort of persons they
   are, what are the objects of their regard or pursuit? You are mistaken
   if you imagine that they are at all influenced by godly zeal. To gain
   or preserve the favor of men is the object they have in view in
   offering this bribe." It was because they were Jews that they adopted
   this method of retaining the good-will, or at least allaying the
   resentment, of their own nation. It is the usual practice of ambitious
   men meanly to fawn on those from whose favor they hope to derive
   advantage, and to insinuate themselves into their good graces, that,
   when better men have been displaced, they may enjoy the undivided
   power. This wicked design he lays open to the Galatians, in order to
   put them on their guard.

   Only lest they should suffer persecution. The pure preaching of the
   gospel is again designated the cross of Christ. But there is likewise
   an allusion to their favourite scheme of resolving to preach Christ
   without the cross. The deadly rage by which the Jews were animated
   against Paul, arose from their being unable to endure a neglect of
   ceremonies. To avoid persecution, those men flattered the Jews. Yet
   after all, if they had themselves kept the law, their conduct might
   have been suffered. On the contrary, they disturbed the whole church
   for the sake of their personal ease, and scrupled not to lay a
   tyrannical yoke on the consciences of men, that they might be entirely
   freed from bodily uneasiness. A dread of the cross led them to corrupt
   the true preaching of the cross.

   13. For neither they who hold by circumcision keep the law. The old
   version and Erasmus translate thus: who are circumcised. But Paul
   appears to me to refer to teachers only; and for this reason I would
   prefer to render the words, those who hold by circumcision, which would
   not include all circumcised persons, and thus would avoid ambiguity.
   The meaning is, "It is not from a strong attachment to the law that
   they bind you with the yoke of ceremonies; for, even with their own
   circumcision, they do not keep the law. It is no doubt under the
   pretext of the law that they require you to be circumcised; but, though
   they have themselves been circumcised, they do not perform what they
   enjoin upon others." When he says, indeed, that they do not keep the
   law, it is doubtful whether he refers to the whole law, or to
   ceremonies. Some understand him as saying that the law is an
   intolerable burden, and therefore they do not satisfy its demands. But
   he rather insinuates against them a charge of insincerity, because,
   except when it suited their own designs, they found themselves at
   liberty to despise the law.

   Even now this disease rages everywhere with virulence. You will find
   many who are prompted more by ambition than by conscience to defend the
   tyranny of the papal system. I speak of our courtly apostles, who are
   attracted by the smell of a kitchen, and who pronounce, with an air of
   authority, that the decrees of the holy Church of Rome must be observed
   with reverence. And what is their own practice all the while! They pay
   no more regard to any decisions of the Roman see than to the braying of
   an ass, but they take care to avoid personal risk. In short, Paul had
   the same kind of controversy with those impostors as we now have with
   hypocritical professors of the gospel, who hold out to us a monstrous
   union between Christ and the Pope. Paul therefore declares that they
   are not acting the part of honest men, and that they have no other
   object in enjoining circumcision than to boast to the Jews of the
   converts they have made. Such is the import of the words, that they may
   glory in your flesh. "They wish to triumph over you, and to gratify
   their own desire of applause, by offering up your mutilated flesh to
   the false zealots of the law, as a token of peace and harmony."

   [100] "The word we render, to make a fair shew,' properly signifies to

   by means of the flesh, that is, not only by boasting of their own
   circumcision, but by making it a point of merit with them, that they
   had pressed the necessity of circumcision upon others." -- Chandler.

   Galatians 6:14-18

   14. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
   world.

   14. Mihi antem absit gloriari, nisi in truce Domini nostri Iesu
   Christi, per quam mundus mihi crucifixus est, et ego mundo.

   15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.

   15. Nam in Christo neque circumcisio quicquam valet, neque praeputium;
   sed nova creatura.

   16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
   mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

   16. Et quicunque hac regula ambulabunt, pax super eos et misericordia,
   et super Israelem Dei.

   17. From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus.

   17. In reliquis nemo facessat mihi molestiam; ego enim stigmata Domini
   Iesu in corpore meo porto.

   18. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
   Amen.

   18. Gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi cum spiritu vestro, fratres.
   Amen.

   To the Galatians written from Rome.

   Ad Galatas missa fuit e Roma.


   14. But God forbid that I should glory. The designs of the false
   apostles are here contrasted with his own sincerity. As if he had said,
   "To avoid being compelled to bear a cross, they deny the cross of
   Christ, purchase with your flesh the applause of men, and end by
   triumphing over you. But my triumph and my glory are in the cross of
   the Son of God." If the Galatians had not been utterly destitute of
   common sense, ought they not to have held in abhorrence the men whom
   they beheld making sport of their dangerous condition.

   To glory in the cross of Christ, is to glory in Christ crucified. But
   something more is implied. In that death, -- so full of disgrace and
   ignominy, which God himself has pronounced to be accursed, and which
   men are wont to view with abhorrence and shame, -- in that death he
   will glory, because he obtains in it perfect happiness. Where man's
   highest good exists, there is his glory. But why does not Paul seek it
   elsewhere? Though salvation is held out to us in the cross of Christ,
   what does he think of his resurrection? I answer, in the cross
   redemption in all its parts is found, but the resurrection of Christ
   does not lead us away from the cross. And let it be carefully observed,
   that every other kind of glorying is rejected by him as nothing short
   of a capital offense. "May God protect us from such a fearful
   calamity!" Such is the import of the phrase which Paul constantly
   employs, God forbid

   BY WHICH the world is crucified. As the Greek word for cross, stauros,
   is masculine, the relative pronoun may be either rendered by whom, or
   by which, according as we refer it to Christ or to the cross. In my
   opinion, however, it is more proper to apply it to the cross; for by it
   strictly we die to the world. But what is the meaning of the world? It
   is unquestionably contrasted with the new creature. Whatever is opposed
   to the spiritual kingdom of Christ is the world, because it belongs to
   the old man; or, in a word, the world is the object and aim of the old
   man.

   The world is crucified to me. This exactly agrees with the language
   which he employs on another occasion.

   "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ; yea
   doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of
   all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ"
   (Philippians 3:7, 8.)

   To crucify the world is to treat it with contempt and disdain.

   He adds, and I unto the world. By this he means that he regarded
   himself as unworthy to be taken into the account, and indeed as utterly
   annihilated; because this was a matter with which a dead man had
   nothing to do. At all events, he means, that by the mortification of
   the old man he had renounced the world. Some take his meaning to be,
   "If the world looks upon me as abhorred and excommunicated, I consider
   the world to be condemned and accursed." This appears to me to be
   overstrained, but I leave my readers to judge.

   15. For in Christ Jesus. The reason why he is crucified to the world,
   and the world to him, is, that in Christ, to whom he is spiritually
   united, nothing but a new creature is of any avail. Everything else
   must be dismissed, must perish. I refer to those things which hinder
   the renewing of the Spirit. "If any man be in Christ" says he, "let him
   be a new creature." (2 Corinthians 5:17.) That is, if any man wishes to
   be considered as belonging to the kingdom of Christ, let him be created
   anew by the Spirit of God; let him not live any longer to himself or to
   the world, but let him be raised up to "newness of life." (Romans 6:4.)
   His reasons for concluding that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
   is of any importance, have been already considered. The truth of the
   gospel swallows up, and brings to nought, all the shadows of the law.

   16. And as many as walk according to this rule. "May they enjoy all
   prosperity and happiness!" This is not merely a prayer in their behalf,
   but a token of approbation. His meaning therefore is, that those who
   teach this doctrine are worthy of all esteem and regard, and those who
   reject it do not deserve to be heard. The word rule denotes the regular
   and habitual course which all godly ministers of the gospel ought to
   pursue. Architects employ a model in the erection of buildings, to
   assist them in preserving the proper form and just proportions. Such a
   model (kanona) does the apostle prescribe to the ministers of the word,
   who are to build the church "according to the pattern shewn to them."
   (Hebrews 8:5.)

   Faithful and upright teachers, and all who allow themselves to conform
   to this rule, must derive singular encouragement from this passage, in
   which God, by the mouth of Paul, pronounces on them a blessing. We have
   no cause to dread the thunders of the Pope, if God promises to us from
   heaven peace and mercy. The word walk may apply both to a minister and
   to his people, though it refers chiefly to ministers. The future tense
   of the verb, (hosoi stoichesousin,) as many as shall walk, is intended
   to express perseverance.

   And upon the Israel of God [101] This is an indirect ridicule of the
   vain boasting of the false apostles, who vaunted of being the
   descendants of Abraham according to the flesh. There are two classes
   who bear this name, a pretended Israel, which appears to be so in the
   sight of men, -- and the Israel of God. Circumcision was a disguise
   before men, but regeneration is a truth before God. In a word, he gives
   the appellation of the Israel of God to those whom he formerly
   denominated the children of Abraham by faith, (Galatians 3:29,) and
   thus includes all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, who were united
   into one church. On the contrary, the name and lineage are the sole
   boast of Israel according to the flesh; and this led the apostle to
   argue in the Epistle to the Romans, that "they are not all Israel which
   are of Israel, neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they
   all children." (Romans 9:6, 7.)

   17. Let no man trouble me. He now speaks with the voice of authority
   for restraining his adversaries, and employs language which his high
   rank fully authorized. "Let them cease to throw hinderances in the
   course of my preaching." He was prepared, for the sake of the church,
   to encounter difficulties, but does not choose to be interrupted by
   contradiction. Let no man trouble me. Let no man make opposition to
   obstruct the progress of my work.

   As to everything else, (tou loipou,) that is, as to everything besides
   the new creature. "This one thing is enough for me. Other matters are
   of no importance, and give me no concern. Let no man question me about
   them." He thus places himself above all men, and allows to none the
   power of attacking his ministry. Literally, the phrase signifies, as to
   the rest or the remainder, which Erasmus, in my opinion, has improperly
   applied to time.

   For I bear [102] in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. This accounts
   for his bold, authoritative language. And what were those marks?
   Imprisonment, chains, scourging, blows, stoning, and every kind of
   injurious treatment which he had incurred in bearing testimony to the
   gospel. Earthly warfare has its honors, in conferring which a general
   holds out to public view the bravery of a soldier. So Christ our leader
   has his own marks, of which he makes abundant use, for conferring on
   some of his followers a high distinction. These marks, however, differ
   from the other in one important respect, that they partake of the
   nature of the cross, and in the sight of the world are disgraceful.
   This is suggested by the word translated marks, (stigmata,) for it
   literally denotes the marks with which barbarian slaves, or fugitives,
   or malefactors, were usually branded. Paul, therefore, can hardly be
   said to use a figure, when he boasts of shining in those marks with
   which Christ is accustomed to honor his most distinguished soldiers,
   [103] which in the eye of the world were attended by shame and
   disgrace, but which before God and the angels surpass all the honors of
   the world. [104]

   18. The grace [105] of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. His
   prayer is not only that God may bestow upon them his grace in large
   measure, but that they may have a proper feeling of it in their hearts.
   Then only is it truly enjoyed by us, when it comes to our spirit. We
   ought therefore to entreat that God would prepare in our souls a
   habitation for his grace. Amen.

   THE ARGUMENT

   Ephesus, which is familiarly known in history under a great variety of
   names, [106] was a very celebrated city of Lesser Asia. The remarkable
   events connected with the work of God in "forming there a people for
   himself," (Isaiah 43:21,) through the labors of Paul, together with the
   commencement and progress of that church, are related by Luke in the
   Acts of the Apostles. At present, I shall do nothing more than glance
   at what bears directly on the argument of the Epistle. The Ephesians
   had been instructed by Paul in the pure doctrine of the gospel. At a
   later period, while he was a prisoner at Rome, and perceiving that they
   needed confirmation, he wrote to them, on that account, the present
   Epistle.

   The first three chapters are chiefly occupied with commending the grace
   of God. Immediately after the salutation in the commencement of the
   first chapter, he treats of God's free election. This affords him an
   opportunity of stating that they were now called into the kingdom of
   God, because they had been appointed to life before they were born. And
   here occurs a striking display of God's wonderful mercy, when the
   salvation of men is traced to its true and native source, the free act
   of adoption. But as the minds of men are ill fitted to receive so
   sublime a mystery, he betakes himself to prayer, that God would
   enlighten the Ephesians in the full knowledge of Christ.

   In the second chapter, by drawing two comparisons, he places in a
   strong light the riches of divine grace. 1. He reminds them how
   wretched they were before they were called to Christ. We never become
   duly sensible of our obligations to Christ, nor estimate aright his
   kindness towards us, till we have been led to view, on the other side,
   the unhappy condition in which we formerly were "without Christ."
   (Ephesians 2:12.) 2. The Gentiles were "aliens" from the promises of
   eternal life, which God had been pleased to bestow on the Jews alone.

   In the third chapter, he declares that he had been appointed to be, in
   a peculiar manner, the Apostle of the Gentiles, because, for a long
   period, they were "strangers and foreigners," (Ephesians 2:19,) but are
   now included among the people of God. As this was an unusual event, and
   as its very novelty produced uneasiness in many minds, he calls it a

   "mystery which in other ages was not made known
   to the sons of men," (Ephesians 3:4,5,)

   but "the dispensation" (Ephesians 3:2) of which had been intrusted to
   himself.

   Towards the close of the chapter, he again prays that God would grant
   to the Ephesians such an intimate knowledge of Christ, that they would
   have no desire to know anything else. His object in doing so is not
   merely to lead them to gratitude to God for so many favors, and to the
   expression of that gratitude by entire devotion to his service, but
   still more to remove all doubt about his own calling. Paul was probably
   afraid that the false apostles would shake their faith by insinuating
   that they had been only half-instructed. They had been Gentiles, and,
   when they embraced pure Christianity, had been told nothing about
   ceremonies or circumcision. But all who enjoined on Christians the
   observance of the law were loud in the avowal, that those who have not
   been introduced into the church of God by circumcision must be held as
   profane persons. This was their ordinary song, that no man who is not
   circumcised is entitled to be reckoned among the people of God, and
   that all the rites prescribed by Moses ought to be observed.
   Accordingly, they brought it as a charge against Paul, that he
   exhibited Christ as equally the Savior of Gentiles and of Jews. They
   asserted that his apostleship was a profanation of the heavenly
   doctrine, because it threw open to wicked men, without discrimination,
   a share in the covenant of grace.

   That the Ephesians, when assailed by these calumnies, might not give
   way, he resolved to meet them. While he argues so earnestly that they
   were called to the gospel because they had been chosen before the
   creation of the world, he charges them, on the other hand, not to
   imagine that the gospel had been accidentally brought to them by the
   will of men, or that it flew to them by chance; [107] for the preaching
   of Christ among them was nothing else than the announcement of that
   eternal decree. While he lays before them the unhappy condition of
   their former life, he at the same time reminds them that the singular
   and astonishing mercy of God appeared in rescuing them from so deep a
   gulf. While he sets before their eyes his own commission as the apostle
   of the Gentiles, he confirms them in the faith which they had once
   received, because they had been divinely admitted into the communion of
   the church. And yet each of the sentences to which we have now referred
   must be viewed as an exhortation fitted to excite the Ephesians to
   gratitude.

   In the fourth chapter, he describes the manner in which the Lord
   governs and protects his church, which is, by the gospel preached by
   men. Hence it follows, that in no other way can its integrity be
   preserved, and that the object at which it aims is true perfection. The
   apostle's design is, to commend to the Ephesians the ministry by which
   God reigns amongst us. He afterwards details the fruits of this
   preaching, -- a holy life and all the duties of piety. Nor does he
   satisfy himself with describing in general terms how Christians ought
   to live, but lays down particular exhortations adapted to the various
   relations of society.

   COMMENTARIES ON THE

   EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ephesians 1:1-6

   1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints
   which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:

   1. Paulus Apostolus Iesu Christi per voluntatem Dei, sanctis omnibus
   qui sunt Ephesi, et fidelibus in Christo Iesu,

   2. Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   2. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro, et Domino Iesu Christo,

   3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ;

   3. Benedictus Deus et Pater Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui benedixit
   nos in omni benedictione spirituali, in coelestibus Christo;

   4. According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

   4. Quemadmodum elegit nos in ipso ante mundi creationem, ut simus
   sancti et inculpati in conspectu suo per charitatem;

   5. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

   5. Qui praedestinavit nos in adoptionem per Iesum Christum in seipso,
   secundum beneplacitum voluntatis suae,

   6. To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us
   accepted in the beloved.

   6. In laudem gloriae gratiae suae, qua nos gratos habuit in dilecto.


   1. Paul, an apostle. As the same form of salutation, or at least very
   little varied, is found in all the Epistles, it would be superfluous to
   repeat here the observations which we have formerly made. He calls
   himself "an apostle of Jesus Christ;" for all to whom has been given
   the ministry of reconciliation are his ambassadors. The word Apostle,
   indeed, carries something more; for it is not every minister of the
   gospel, as we shall afterwards see, (Ephesians 4:11,) that can be
   called an apostle. But this subject has been explained more fully in my
   remarks on the Epistle to the Galatians. (See Calvin on "Galatians
   1:1")

   He adds, by the will of God; for "no man ought to take this honor unto
   himself," (Hebrews 5:4,) but every man ought to wait for the calling of
   God, which alone makes lawful ministers. He thus meets the jeers of
   wicked men by holding out the authority of God, and removes every
   occasion of inconsiderate strife.

   To all the saints. He gives the name of saints to those whom he
   afterwards denominates faithful in Christ Jesus. No man, therefore, is
   a believer who is not also a saint; and, on the other hand, no man is a
   saint who is not a believer. Most of the Greek copies want the word
   all; but I was unwilling to strike it out, because it must, at all
   events, be understood.

   3. Blessed [108] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The
   lofty terms in which he extolls the grace of God toward the Ephesians,
   are intended to rouse their hearts to gratitude, to set them all on
   flame, to fill them even to overflowing with this thought. They who
   perceive in themselves discoveries of the Divine goodness, so full and
   absolutely perfect, and who make them the subject of earnest
   meditation, will never embrace new doctrines, by which the very grace
   which they feel so powerfully in themselves is thrown into the shade.
   The design of the apostle, therefore, in asserting the riches of divine
   grace toward the Ephesians, was to protect them against having their
   faith shaken by the false apostles, as if their calling were doubtful,
   or salvation were to be sought in some other way. He shews, at the same
   time, that the full certainty of future happiness rests on the
   revelation of his love to us in Christ, which God makes in the gospel.
   But to confirm the matter more fully, he rises to the first cause, to
   the fountain, -- the eternal election of God, by which, ere we are
   born, (Romans 9:11,) we are adopted as sons. This makes it evident that
   their salvation was accomplished, not by any accidental or unlooked-for
   occurrence, but by the eternal and unchangeable decree of God.

   The word bless is here used in more than one sense, as referring to
   God, and as referring to men. I find in Scripture four different
   significations of this word. 1. We are said to bless God when we offer
   praise to him for his goodness. 2. God is said to bless us, when he
   crowns our undertakings with success, and, in the exercise of his
   goodness, bestows upon us happiness and prosperity; and the reason is,
   that our enjoyments depend entirely upon his pleasure. Our attention is
   here called to the singular efficacy which dwells in the very word of
   God, and which Paul expresses in beautiful language. 3. Men bless each
   other by prayer. 4. The priest's blessing is not simply a prayer, but
   is likewise a testimony and pledge of the Divine blessing; for the
   priests received a commission to bless in the name of the Lord. Paul
   therefore blesses God, because he hath blessed us, that is, hath
   enriched us with all blessing and grace.

   With all spiritual blessings. I have no objection to Chrysostom's
   remark, that the word spiritual conveys an implied contrast between the
   blessing of Moses and of Christ. The law had its blessings; but in
   Christ only is perfection found, because he gives us a perfect
   revelation of the kingdom of God, which leads us directly to heaven.
   When the body itself is presented to us, figures are no longer needed.

   In heavenly. Whether we understand the meaning to be, in heavenly
   Places, or in heavenly Benefits, is of little consequence. All that was
   intended to be expressed is the superiority of that grace which we
   receive through Christ. The happiness which it bestows is not in this
   world, but in heaven and everlasting life. In the Christian religion,
   indeed, as we are elsewhere taught, (1 Timothy 4:8,) is contained the
   "promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come;" but
   its aim is spiritual happiness, for the kingdom of Christ is spiritual.
   A contrast is drawn between Christ and all the Jewish emblems, by which
   the blessing under the law was conveyed; for where Christ is, all those
   things are superfluous.

   4. According as he hath chosen us. The foundation and first cause, both
   of our calling and of all the benefits which we receive from God, is
   here declared to be his eternal election. If the reason is asked, why
   God has called us to enjoy the gospel, why he daily bestows upon us so
   many blessings, why he opens to us the gate of heaven, -- the answer
   will be constantly found in this principle, that he hath chosen us
   before the foundation of the world. The very time when the election
   took place proves it to be free; for what could we have deserved, or
   what merit did we possess, before the world was made? How childish is
   the attempt to meet this argument by the following sophism! "We were
   chosen because we were worthy, and because God foresaw that we would be
   worthy." We were all lost in Adam; and therefore, had not God, through
   his own election, rescued us from perishing, there was nothing to be
   foreseen. The same argument is used in the Epistle to the Romans,
   where, speaking of Jacob and Esau, he says,

   "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or
   evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
   works, but of him that calleth." (Romans 9:11.)

   But though they had not yet acted, might a sophist of the Sorbonne
   reply, God foresaw that they would act. This objection has no force
   when applied to the depraved natures of men, in whom nothing can be
   seen but materials for destruction.

   In Christ. This is the second proof that the election is free; for if
   we are chosen in Christ, it is not of ourselves. It is not from a
   perception of anything that we deserve, but because our heavenly Father
   has introduced us, through the privilege of adoption, into the body of
   Christ. In short, the name of Christ excludes all merit, and everything
   which men have of their own; for when he says that we are chosen in
   Christ, it follows that in ourselves we are unworthy.

   That we should be holy. This is the immediate, but not the chief
   design; for there is no absurdity in supposing that the same thing may
   gain two objects. The design of building is, that there should be a
   house. This is the immediate design, but the convenience of dwelling in
   it is the ultimate design. It was necessary to mention this in passing;
   for we shall immediately find that Paul mentions another design, the
   glory of God. But there is no contradiction here; for the glory of God
   is the highest end, to which our sanctification is subordinate.

   This leads us to conclude, that holiness, purity, and every excellence
   that is found among men, are the fruit of election; so that once more
   Paul expressly puts aside every consideration of merit. If God had
   foreseen in us anything worthy of election, it would have been stated
   in language the very opposite of what is here employed, and which
   plainly means that all our holiness and purity of life flow from the
   election of God. How comes it then that some men are religious, and
   live in the fear of God, while others give themselves up without
   reserve to all manner of wickedness? If Paul may be believed, the only
   reason is, that the latter retain their natural disposition, and the
   former have been chosen to holiness. The cause, certainly, is not later
   than the effect. Election, therefore, does not depend on the
   righteousness of works, of which Paul here declares that it is the
   cause.

   We learn also from these words, that election gives no occasion to
   licentiousness, or to the blasphemy of wicked men who say, "Let us live
   in any manner we please; for, if we have been elected, we cannot
   perish." Paul tells them plainly, that they have no right to separate
   holiness of life from the grace of election; for

   "whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called,
   them he also justified." (Romans 8:30.)

   The inference, too, which the Catharists, Celestines, and Donatists
   drew from these words, that we may attain perfection in this life, is
   without foundation. This is the goal to which the whole course of our
   life must be directed, and we shall not reach it till we have finished
   our course. Where are the men who dread and avoid the doctrine of
   predestination as an inextricable labyrinth, who believe it to be
   useless and almost dangerous? No doctrine is more useful, provided it
   be handled in the proper and cautious manner, of which Paul gives us an
   example, when he presents it as an illustration of the infinite
   goodness of God, and employs it as an excitement to gratitude. This is
   the true fountain from which we must draw our knowledge of the divine
   mercy. If men should evade every other argument, election shuts their
   mouth, so that they dare not and cannot claim anything for themselves.
   But let us remember the purpose for which Paul reasons about
   predestination, lest, by reasoning with any other view, we fall into
   dangerous errors.

   Before him in love. Holiness before God (katenopion autou) is that of a
   pure conscience; for God is not deceived, as men are, by outward
   pretense, but looks to faith, or, which means the same thing, the truth
   of the heart. If we view the word love as applied to God, the meaning
   will be, that the only reason why he chose us, was his love to men. But
   I prefer connecting it with the latter part of the verse, as denoting
   that the perfection of believers consists in love; not that God
   requires love alone, but that it is an evidence of the fear of God, and
   of obedience to the whole law.

   5. Who hath predestinated us. What follows is intended still further to
   heighten the commendation of divine grace. The reason why Paul
   inculcated so earnestly on the Ephesians the doctrines of free adoption
   through Christ, and of the eternal election which preceded it, has been
   already considered. But as the mercy of God is nowhere acknowledged in
   more elevated language, this passage will deserve our careful
   attention. Three causes of our salvation are here mentioned, and a
   fourth is shortly afterwards added. The efficient cause is the good
   pleasure of the will of God, the material cause is, Jesus Christ, and
   the final cause is, the praise of the glory of his grace. Let us now
   see what he says respecting each.

   To the first belongs the whole of the following statement God hath
   predestinated us in himself, according to the good pleasure of his
   will, unto the adoption of sons, and hath made us accepted by his
   grace. In the word predestinate we must again attend to the order. We
   were not then in existence, and therefore there was no merit of ours.
   The cause of our salvation did not proceed from us, but from God alone.
   Yet Paul, not satisfied with these statements, adds in himself. The
   Greek phrase is, eis hauton, and has the same meaning with en hauto. By
   this he means that God did not seek a cause out of himself, but
   predestinated us, because such was his will.

   But this is made still more clear by what follows, according to the
   good pleasure of his will. The word will was enough, for Paul very
   frequently contrasts it with all outward causes by which men are apt to
   imagine that the mind of God is influenced. But that no doubt may
   remain, he employs the word good pleasure, which expressly sets aside
   all merit. In adopting us, therefore, God does not inquire what we are,
   and is not reconciled to us by any personal worth. His single motive is
   the eternal good pleasure, by which he predestinated us. [109] Why,
   then, are the sophists not ashamed to mingle with them other
   considerations, when Paul so strongly forbids us to look at anything
   else than the good pleasure of God?

   Lest anything should still be wanting, he adds, echaritosen en chariti
   [110] This intimates, that, in the freest manner, and on no mercenary
   grounds, does God bestow upon us his love and favor, just as, when we
   were not yet born, and when he was prompted by nothing but his own
   will, he fixed upon us his choice. [111]

   The material cause both of eternal election, and of the love which is
   now revealed, is Christ, the Beloved. This name is given, to remind us
   that by him the love of God is communicated to us. Thus he is the
   well-beloved, in order that we may be reconciled by him. The highest
   and last end is immediately added, the glorious praise of such abundant
   grace. Every man, therefore, who hides this glory, is endeavoring to
   overturn the everlasting purpose of God. Such is the doctrine of the
   sophists, which entirely overturns the doctrine of Christ, lest the
   whole glory of our salvation should be ascribed undividedly to God
   alone.

   Ephesians 1:7-12

   7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins, according to the riches of his grace;

   7. In quo habemus redemptionem per sangiunem ejus, remissionem
   peccatorum, secundum divitias gratiae ejus;

   8. Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

   8. Qua exundavit in nos in omni sapientia et prudentia;

   9. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his
   good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself:

   9. Patefacto nobis arcano voluntatis suae, secundum beneplacitum suum,
   quod in seipso proposuerat.

   10. That, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather
   together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
   which are on earth, even in him:

   10. In dispensationem plenitudinis temporum; ut recolligeret omnia in
   Christo, tam quae in coelis sunt, quam quae super terram, in ipso.

   11. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
   according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will;

   11. Per quem etiam in sortem adsciti sumus, praedestinati secundum
   propositum ejus, qui omnia efficit secundum consilium voluntatis suae;

   12. That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in
   Christ.

   12. Ut simus in laudem gloriae ipsius, nos qui ante speravimus in
   Christo.


   7. In whom we have redemption. The apostle is still illustrating the
   material cause, -- the manner in which we are reconciled to God through
   Christ. By his death he has restored us to favor with the Father; and
   therefore we ought always to direct our minds to the blood of Christ,
   as the means by which we obtain divine grace. After mentioning that,
   through the blood of Christ, we obtain redemption, he immediately
   styles it the forgiveness of sins, -- to intimate that we are redeemed,
   because our sins are not imputed to us. Hence it follows, that we
   obtain by free grace that righteousness by which we are accepted of
   God, and freed from the chains of the devil and of death. The close
   connection which is here preserved, between our redemption itself and
   the manner in which it is obtained, deserves our notice; for, so long
   as we remain exposed to the judgment of God, we are bound by miserable
   chains, and therefore our exemption from guilt, becomes an invaluable
   freedom.

   According to the riches of his grace. He now returns to the efficient
   cause, -- the largeness of the divine kindness, which has given Christ
   to us as our Redeemer. Riches, and the corresponding word overflow, in
   the following verse, are intended to give us large views of divine
   grace. The apostle feels himself unable to celebrate, in a proper
   manner, the goodness of God, and desires that the contemplation of it
   would occupy the minds of men till they are entirely lost in
   admiration. How desirable is it that men were deeply impressed with
   "the riches of that grace" which is here commended! No place would any
   longer be found for pretended satisfactions, or for those trifles by
   which the world vainly imagines that it can redeem itself; as if the
   blood of Christ, when unsupported by additional aid, had lost all its
   efficacy. [112]

   8. In all wisdom. He now comes to the formal cause, the preaching of
   the gospel, by which the goodness of God overflows upon us. [113] It is
   through faith that we receive Christ, by whom we come to God, and by
   whom we enjoy the privilege of adoption. Paul gives to the gospel the
   magnificent appellations of wisdom and prudence, for the purpose of
   leading the Ephesians to despise all contrary doctrines. The false
   apostles insinuated themselves, under the pretense of imparting views
   more elevated than the elementary instructions which Paul conveyed. And
   the devil, in order to undermine our faith, labors, as far as he can,
   to disparage the gospel. Paul, on the other hand, builds up the
   authority of the gospel, that believers may rest upon it with unshaken
   confidence. All wisdom means -- full or perfect wisdom.

   9. Having made known to us the mystery of his will. Some were alarmed
   at the novelty of his doctrine. With a view to such persons, he very
   properly denominates it a mystery of the divine will, and yet a mystery
   which God has now been pleased to reveal. As he formerly ascribed their
   election, so he now ascribes their calling, to the good pleasure of
   God. The Ephesians are thus led to consider that Christ has been made
   known, and the gospel preached to them, not because they deserved any
   such thing, but because it pleased God.

   Which he hath purposed in himself. All is wisely and properly arranged.
   What can be more just than that his purposes, with which men are
   unacquainted, should be known to God alone, so long as he is pleased to
   conceal them, -- or, again, that it should be in his own will and power
   to fix the time when they shall be communicated to men? The decree to
   adopt the Gentiles is declared to have been till now hidden in the mind
   of God, but so hidden, that God reserved it in his own power until the
   time of the revelation. Does any one now complain of it as a new and
   unprecedented occurrence, that those who were formerly "without God in
   the world," (Ephesians 2:12,) should be received into the church? Will
   he have the hardihood to deny that the knowledge of God is greater than
   that of men?

   10. That in the dispensation of the fullness of times. That no man may
   inquire, why one time rather than another was selected, the apostle
   anticipates such curiosity, by calling the appointed period the
   fullness of times, the fit and proper season, as he also did in a
   former epistle. (Galatians 4:4) Let human presumption restrain itself,
   and, in judging of the succession of events, let it bow to the
   providence of God. The same lesson is taught by the word dispensation,
   for by the judgment of God the lawful administration of all events is
   regulated.

   That he might gather together in one. In the old translation it is
   rendered (instaurare) restore; to which Erasmus has added (summatim)
   comprehensively. I have chosen to abide closely by the meaning of the
   Greek word, anakephalaiosasthai, [114] because it is more agreeable to
   the context. The meaning appears to me to be, that out of Christ all
   things were disordered, and that through him they have been restored to
   order. And truly, out of Christ, what can we perceive in the world but
   mere ruins? We are alienated from God by sin, and how can we but
   present a broken and shattered aspect? The proper condition of
   creatures is to keep close to God. Such a gathering together
   (anakephalaiosis) as might bring us back to regular order, the apostle
   tells us, has been made in Christ. Formed into one body, we are united
   to God, and closely connected with each other. Without Christ, on the
   other hand, the whole world is a shapeless chaos and frightful
   confusion. We are brought into actual unity by Christ alone.

   But why are heavenly beings included in the number? The angels were
   never separated from God, and cannot be said to have been scattered.
   Some explain it in this manner. Angels are said to be gathered
   together, because men have become members of the same society, are
   admitted equally with them to fellowship with God, and enjoy happiness
   in common with them by means of this blessed unity. The mode of
   expression is supposed to resemble one frequently used, when we speak
   of a whole building as repaired, many parts of which were ruinous or
   decayed, though some parts remained entire.

   This is no doubt true; but what hinders us from saying that the angels
   also have been gathered together? Not that they were ever scattered,
   but their attachment to the service of God is now perfect, and their
   state is eternal. What comparison is there between a creature and the
   Creator, without the interposition of a Mediator? So far as they are
   creatures, had it not been for the benefit which they derived from
   Christ, they would have been liable to change and to sin, and
   consequently their happiness would not have been eternal. Who then will
   deny that both angels and men have been brought back to a fixed order
   by the grace of Christ? Men had been lost, and angels were not beyond
   the reach of danger. By gathering both into his own body, Christ hath
   united them to God the Father, and established actual harmony between
   heaven and earth.

   11. Through whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Hitherto he has
   spoken generally of all the elect; he now begins to take notice of
   separate classes. When he says, WE have obtained, he speaks of himself
   and of the Jews, or, perhaps more correctly, of all who were the first
   fruits of Christianity; and afterwards he comes to the Ephesians. It
   tended not a little to confirm the faith of the Ephesian converts, that
   he associated them with himself and the other believers, who might be
   said to be the first-born in the church. As if he had said, "The
   condition of all godly persons is the same with yours; for we who were
   first called by God owe our acceptance to his eternal election." Thus,
   he shews, that, from first to last, all have obtained salvation by free
   grace, because they have been freely adopted according to eternal
   election.

   Who worketh all things. The circumlocution employed in describing the
   Supreme Being deserves attention. He speaks of Him as the sole agent,
   and as doing everything according to His own will, so as to leave
   nothing to be done by man. In no respect, therefore, are men admitted
   to share in this praise, as if they brought anything of their own. God
   looks at nothing out of himself to move him to elect them, for the
   counsel of his own will is the only and actual cause of their election.
   This may enable us to refute the error, or rather the madness, of those
   who, whenever they are unable to discover the reason of God's works,
   exclaim loudly against his design.

   12. That we should be to the praise of his glory. Here again he
   mentions the final cause of salvation; for we must eventually become
   illustrations of the glory of God, if we are nothing but vessels of his
   mercy. The word glory, by way of eminence, (kat ' exochen) denotes, in
   a peculiar manner, that which shines in the goodness of God; for there
   is nothing that is more peculiarly his own, or in which he desires more
   to be glorified, than goodness.

   Ephesians 1:13-14

   13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
   gospel of your salvation: in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were
   sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,

   13. In quo vos etiam, audito sermone veritatis, Evangelio salutis
   vestrae; in quo etiam, postquam credidistis, obsignati estis Spiritu
   promissionis sancto,

   14. Which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of
   the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

   14. Qui est arrhabo haereditatis nostrae, in redemptionem acquisitae
   possessionis, in laudem gloriae ejus.


   13. In whom ye also. He associates the Ephesians with himself, and with
   the rest of those who were the first fruits; for he says that they, in
   like manner, trusted in Christ. His object is, to shew that both had
   the same faith; and therefore we must supply the word trusted from the
   twelfth verse. He afterwards states that they were brought to that hope
   by the preaching of the gospel.

   Two epithets are here applied to the gospel, -- the word of truth, and
   the gospel of your salvation. Both deserve our careful attention.
   Nothing is more earnestly attempted by Satan than to lead us either to
   doubt or to despise the gospel. Paul therefore furnishes us with two
   shields, by which we may repel both temptations. In opposition to every
   doubt, let us learn to bring forward this testimony, that the gospel is
   not only certain truth, which cannot deceive, but is, by way of
   eminence, (kat ' exochen,) the word of truth, as if, strictly speaking,
   there were no truth but itself. If the temptation be to contempt or
   dislike of the gospel, let us remember that its power and efficacy have
   been manifested in bringing to us salvation. The apostle had formerly
   declared that

   "it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believeth,"
   (Romans 1:16;)

   but here he expresses more, for he reminds the Ephesians that, having
   been made partakers of salvation, they had learned this by their own
   experience. Unhappy they who weary themselves, as the world generally
   does, in wandering through many winding paths, neglecting the gospel,
   and pleasing themselves with wild romances, --

   "ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,"
   (2 Timothy 3:7)

   or to find life! But happy they who have embraced the gospel, and whose
   attachment to it is steadfast; for this, beyond all doubt, is truth and
   life.

   In whom also, after that ye believed. Having maintained that the gospel
   is certain, he now comes to the proof. And what higher surety can be
   found than the Holy Spirit? "Having denominated the gospel the word of
   truth, I will not prove it by the authority of men; for you have the
   testimony of the Spirit of God himself, who seals the truth of it in
   your hearts." This elegant comparison is taken from Seals, which among
   men have the effect of removing doubt. Seals give validity both to
   charters and to testaments; anciently, they were the principal means by
   which the writer of a letter could be known; and, in short, a seal
   distinguishes what is true and certain, from what is false and
   spurious. This office the apostle ascribes to the Holy Spirit, not only
   here, but in another part of this Epistle, (Ephesians 4:30,) and in the
   Second Epistle to the Corinthians, (2 Corinthians 1:22.) Our minds
   never become so firmly established in the truth of God as to resist all
   the temptations of Satan, until we have been confirmed in it by the
   Holy Spirit. The true conviction which believers have of the word of
   God, of their own salvation, and of religion in general, does not
   spring from the judgment of the flesh, or from human and philosophical
   arguments, but from the sealing of the Spirit, who imparts to their
   consciences such certainty as to remove all doubt. The foundation of
   faith would be frail and unsteady, if it rested on human wisdom; and
   therefore, as preaching is the instrument of faith, so the Holy Spirit
   makes preaching efficacious.

   But is it not the faith itself which is here said to be sealed by the
   Holy Spirit? If so, faith goes before the sealing. I answer, there are
   two operations of the Spirit in faith, corresponding to the two parts
   of which faith consists, as it enlightens, and as it establishes the
   mind. The commencement of faith is knowledge: the completion of it is a
   firm and steady conviction, which admits of no opposing doubt. Both, I
   have said, are the work of the Spirit. No wonder, then, if Paul should
   declare that the Ephesians, who received by faith the truth of the
   gospel, were confirmed in that faith by the seal of the Holy Spirit.

   With that Holy Spirit of promise. This title is derived from the effect
   produced; for to him we owe it that the promise of salvation is not
   made to us in vain. As God promises in his word, "that he will be to us
   a Father," (2 Corinthians 6:18,) so he gives to us the evidence of
   having adopted us by the Holy Spirit.

   14. Which is the earnest [115] of our inheritance. This phrase is twice
   used by Paul in another Epistle. (2 Corinthians 1:22; 5:5.) The
   metaphor is taken from bargains, in which, when a pledge has been given
   and accepted, the whole is confirmed, and no room is left for a change
   of mind. Thus, when we have received the Spirit of God, his promises
   are confirmed to us, and no dread is felt that they will be revoked. In
   themselves, indeed, the promises of God are not weak; but, until we are
   supported by the testimony of the Spirit, we never rest upon them with
   unshaken confidence. The Spirit, then, is the earnest of our
   inheritance of eternal life, until the redemption, that is, until the
   day of complete redemption is arrived. So long as we are in this world,
   our warfare is sustained by hope, and therefore this earnest is
   necessary; but when the possession itself shall have been obtained, the
   necessity and use of the earnest will then cease.

   The significance of a pledge lasts no longer than till both parties
   have fulfilled the bargain; and, accordingly, he afterwards adds, ye
   are sealed to the day of redemption, (Ephesians 4:30,) which means the
   day of judgment. Though we are now redeemed by the blood of Christ, the
   fruit of that redemption does not yet appear; for "every creature
   groaneth, desiring to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. And
   not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the
   Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
   adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body;" for we have not yet
   obtained it, but by hope. (Romans 8:21-23.) But we shall obtain it in
   reality, when Christ shall appear to judgment. Such is the meaning of
   the word redemption in the passage now quoted from the Epistle to the
   Romans, and in a saying of our Lord,

   "Look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh."
   (Luke 21:28.)

   Peripoiesis, which we translate the possession obtained, is not the
   kingdom of heaven, or a blessed immortality, but the Church itself.
   This is added for their consolation, that they might not think it hard
   to cherish their hope till the day of Christ's coming, or be displeased
   that they have not yet obtained the promised inheritance; for such is
   the common lot of the whole Church.

   To the praise of his glory. The word praise, as in the twelfth verse,
   Ephesians 1:12 signifies "making known." [116] The glory of God may
   sometimes be concealed, or imperfectly exhibited. But in the Ephesians
   God had given proofs of his goodness, that his glory might be
   celebrated and openly proclaimed. Those persons, therefore, who
   slighted the calling of the Ephesians, might be charged with envying
   and slighting the glory of God.

   The frequent mention of the glory of God ought not to be regarded as
   superfluous, for what is infinite cannot be too strongly expressed.
   This is particularly true in commendations of the Divine mercy, for
   which every godly person will always feel himself unable to find
   adequate language. He will be more ready to utter, than other men will
   be to hear, the expression of praise; for the eloquence both of men and
   angels, after being strained to the utmost, falls immeasurably below
   the vastness of this subject. We may likewise observe, that there is
   not a more effectual method of shutting the mouths of wicked men, than
   by shewing that our views tend to illustrate, and theirs to obscure,
   the glory of God.

   differs from a pledge, which is somewhat given for the security of a

   Ephesians 1:15-19

   15. Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
   and love unto all the saints,

   15. Quapropter ego etiam, audita fide quae apud vos est in Domino Iesu,
   et charitate erga omnes sanctos,

   16. Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
   prayers;

   16. Non cesso gratias agere pro vobis, memoriam vestri faciens in
   orationibus meis;

   17. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
   give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
   him:

   17. Ut Deus Domini nostri Iesu Christi, Pater gloriae, det vobis
   Spiritum sapientiae et revelationis, in agnitione ipsius,

   18. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know
   what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of
   his inheritance in the saints,

   18. Illuminatos oculos mentis vestrae, ut sciatis quae sit spes
   vocationis ipsius, et quae divitiae gloriae haereditatis ejus in
   sanctis,

   19. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who
   believe, according to the working of his mighty power.

   19. Et quae superexcellens magnitudo potentiae ejus erga nos, qui
   credidimus secundum efficaciam potentiae roboris ejus.


   15. Wherefore I also. This thanksgiving was not simply an expression of
   his ardent love to the Ephesians. He congratulated them before God,
   that the opinion which he had formed respecting them was highly
   favorable. Observe here, that under faith and love Paul includes
   generally the whole excellence of Christian character. He uses the
   expression, faith in the Lord Jesus, [117] because Christ is the aim
   and object of faith. Love ought to embrace all men, but here the saints
   are particularly mentioned; because love, when properly regulated,
   begins with them, and is afterwards extended to all others. If our love
   must have a view to God, the nearer any man approaches to God, the
   stronger unquestionably must be his claims to our love.

   16. Making mention of you. To thanksgiving, as his custom is, he adds
   prayer, in order to excite them to additional progress. It was
   necessary that the Ephesians should understand that they had entered
   upon the proper course. But it was equally necessary that they should
   not turn aside to any new scheme of doctrine, or become indifferent
   about proceeding farther; for nothing is more dangerous than to be
   satisfied with that measure of spiritual benefits which has been
   already obtained. Whatever, then, may be the height of our attainments,
   let them be always accompanied by the desire of something higher.

   17. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. But what does Paul wish for
   the Ephesians? The spirit of wisdom, and the eyes of their
   understanding being enlightened. And did they not possess these? Yes;
   but at the same time they needed increase, that, being endowed with a
   larger measure of the Spirit, and being more and more enlightened, they
   might more clearly and fully hold their present views. The knowledge of
   the godly is never so pure, but that some dimness or obscurity hangs
   over their spiritual vision. But let us examine the words in detail.

   The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Son of God became man in such a
   manner, that God was his God as well as ours.

   "I ascend," says he, "to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and
   your God." (John 20:17)

   And the reason why he is our God, is, that he is the God of Christ,
   whose members we are. Let us remember, however, that this relates to
   his human nature; so that his subjection takes nothing away from his
   eternal godhead.

   The Father of glory. This title springs from the former; for God's
   glory, as a Father, consists in subjecting his Son to our condition,
   that, through him, he might be our God. The Father of glory is a
   well-known Hebrew idiom for The glorious Father. There is a mode of
   pointing and reading this passage, which I do not disapprove, and which
   connects the two clauses in this manner: That God, the glorious Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, may give to you.

   The Spirit of wisdom and revelation is here put, by a figure of speech,
   (metonymy,) for the grace which the Lord bestows upon us by his own
   Spirit. But let it be observed, that the gifts of the Spirit are not
   the gifts of nature. Till the Lord opens them, the eyes of our heart
   are blind. Till the Spirit has become our instructor, all that we know
   is folly and ignorance. Till the Spirit of God has made it known to us
   by a secret revelation, the knowledge of our Divine calling exceeds the
   capacity of our own minds.

   In the knowledge of him. This might also be read, In the knowledge of
   himself. Both renderings agree well with the context, for he that knows
   the Son knows also the Father; but I prefer the former as more natively
   suggested by the Greek pronoun, en epignosei autou

   18. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened. The eyes of your
   heart is the rendering of the Vulgate, which is supported by some Greek
   manuscripts. The difference is immaterial, for the Hebrews frequently
   employ it to denote the rational powers of the soul, though more
   strictly, being the seat of the affections, it means the will or
   desire; but I have preferred the ordinary translation.

   And what the riches. A comparison, suggested by its excellence, reminds
   us how unfit we are to receive this elevated knowledge; for the power
   of God is no small matter. This great power, he tells us, had been
   exerted, and in a very extraordinary manner, towards the Ephesians, who
   were thus laid under constant obligations to follow his calling. By
   thus extolling the grace of God toward themselves, he intended to check
   every tendency to despise or dislike the duties of the Christian life.
   But the splendid encomiums which he pronounces on faith convey to us
   also this instruction, that it is so admirable a work and gift of God,
   that no language can do justice to its excellence. Paul is not in the
   habit of throwing out hyperboles without discrimination; but when he
   comes to treat of a matter which lies so far beyond this world as faith
   does, he raises our minds to the admiration of heavenly power.

   19. According to the working. Some consider this clause as referring
   solely to the word believe, which comes immediately before it; but I
   rather view it as an additional statement, tending to heighten the
   greatness of the power, as a demonstration, or, if you prefer it, an
   instance and evidence of the efficacy of the power. The repetition of
   the word power, (dunameos) has the appearance of being superfluous; but
   in the former case it is restricted to one class, -- in the next, it
   has a general application. Paul, we find, never thinks that he can say
   enough in his descriptions of the Christian calling. And certainly the
   power of God is wonderfully displayed, when we are brought from death
   to life, and when, from being the children of hell, we become the
   children of God and heirs of eternal life.

   Foolish men imagine that this language is absurdly hyperbolical; but
   godly persons, who are engaged in daily struggles with inward
   corruption, have no difficulty in perceiving that not a word is here
   used beyond what is perfectly just. As the importance of the subject
   cannot be too strongly expressed, so our unbelief and ingratitude led
   Paul to employ this glowing language. We never form adequate
   conceptions of the treasure revealed to us in the gospel; or, if we do,
   we cannot persuade ourselves that it is possible for us to do so,
   because we perceive nothing in us that corresponds to it, but
   everything the reverse. Paul's object, therefore, was not only to
   impress the Ephesians with a deep sense of the value of Divine grace,
   but also to give them exalted views of the glory of Christ's kingdom.
   That they might not be cast down by a view of their own unworthiness,
   he exhorts them to consider the power of God; as if he had said, that
   their regeneration was no ordinary work of God, but was an astonishing
   exhibition of his power.

   According to the efficacy of the power of his strength. There are three
   words here, on which we may make a passing remark. We may view strength
   as the root, -- power as the tree, -- and efficacy as the fruit, or the
   stretching out of the Divine arm which terminates in action.

   [117] "Having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus.' It is wrong to
   argue from this expression, with Olshausen and De Wette, that the
   apostle had no personal knowledge of the persons whom he addressed.
   This was an early surmise, for it is referred to by Theodoret. Some,
   says he, have supposed that the apostle wrote to the Ephesians, hos
   medepo theasamenos autous, (as having never seen them.) But some years
   had elapsed since the apostle had visited Ephesus, and seen the
   Ephesian Church; and might he not refer to reports of their Christian
   steadfastness which had reached him? Nay, his use of the word may
   signify that such intelligence had been repeatedly brought to him." --

   Ephesians 1:20-23

   20. Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
   set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

   20. Quam exeruit in Christo, dum illum excitavit a mortuis, et sedere
   fecit in dextera sua, in coelestibus;

   21. Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and
   every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that
   which is to come;

   21. Super omnem principatum, et potestatem, et virtutem, et
   dominationem, et omne nomen quod nominatur, non tantum in seculo hoc,
   sed etiam in futuro;

   22. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head
   over all things to the church,

   22. Et omnia subjecit pedibus ejus, et ipsum posuit caput super omnia
   Ecclesiae,

   23. Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.

   23. Quae est corpus ejus et complementum ejus, qui omnia in omnibus
   adimplet.


   20. Which he wrought in Christ. The Greek verb is energesen, from which
   energeia is derived. It might run thus, According to the efficacy which
   he effected. But the translation which I have given conveys the same
   meaning, and is less harsh.

   With the greatest propriety does he enjoin us to contemplate this power
   in Christ; for in us it is hitherto concealed. "My strength," says he,
   "is made perfect in weakness." (2 Corinthians 12:9.) In what do we
   excel the children of the world but in this, that our condition appears
   to be somewhat worse than theirs? Though sin does not reign, it
   continues to dwell in us, and death is still strong. Our blessedness,
   which lies in hope, is not perceived by the world. The power of the
   Spirit is a thing unknown to flesh and blood. A thousand distresses, to
   which we are daily liable, render us more despised than other men.

   Christ alone, therefore, is the mirror in which we can contemplate that
   which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly seen in
   ourselves. When our minds rise to a confident anticipation of
   righteousness, salvation, and glory, let us learn to turn them to
   Christ. We still lie under the power of death; but he, raised from the
   dead by heavenly power, has the dominion of life. We labor under the
   bondage of sin, and, surrounded by endless vexations, are engaged in a
   hard warfare, (1 Timothy 1:18;) but he, sitting at the right hand of
   the Father, exercises the highest government in heaven and earth, and
   triumphs gloriously over the enemies whom he has subdued and
   vanquished. We lie here mean and despised; but to him has been "given a
   name" (Philippians 2:9,) which angels and men regard with reverence,
   and devils and wicked men with dread. We are pressed down here by the
   scantiness of all our comforts: but he has been appointed by the Father
   to be the sole dispenser of all blessings. For these reasons, we shall
   find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in
   a mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the
   unmeasurable greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested
   in ourselves.

   And set him at his own right hand. This passage shews plainly, if any
   one does, what is meant by the right hand of God. It does not mean any
   particular place, but the power which the Father has bestowed on
   Christ, that he may administer in his name the government of heaven and
   earth. It is idle, therefore, to inquire why Stephen saw him standing,
   (Acts 7:55,) while Paul describes him as sitting at God's right hand.
   The expression does not refer to any bodily posture, but denotes the
   highest royal power with which Christ has been invested. This is
   intimated by what immediately follows, far above all principality and
   power: for the whole of this description is added for the purpose of
   explaining what is meant by the right hand.

   God the Father is said to have raised Christ to "his right hand,"
   because he has made him to share in his government, because by him he
   exerts all his power; the metaphor being borrowed from earthly princes,
   who confer the honor of sitting along with themselves on those whom
   they have clothed with the highest authority. As the right hand of God
   fills heaven and earth, it follows that the kingdom and power of Christ
   are equally extensive. It is in vain, therefore, to attempt to prove
   that, because Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, he dwells in
   heaven alone. His human nature, it is true, resides in heaven, and not
   in earth; but that argument is foreign to the purpose. The expression
   which follows, in heavenly places, does not at all imply that the right
   hand of God is confined to heaven, but directs us to contemplate the
   heavenly glory amidst which our Lord Jesus dwells, the blessed
   immortality which he enjoys, and the dominion over angels to which he
   has been exalted.

   21. Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion. All
   these names, there can be no doubt, are applied to angels, who are so
   denominated, because, by means of them, God exercises his power, and
   might, and dominion. He permits them to share, as far as is competent
   to creatures, what belongs to himself, and even gives to them his own
   name; for we find that they are called 'lhym, (elohim,) gods. From the
   diversity of names we conclude that there are various orders of angels;
   but to attempt to settle these with exactness, to fix their number, or
   determine their ranks, would not merely discover foolish curiosity, but
   would be rash, wicked, and dangerous.

   But why did he not simply call them Angels? I answer, it was to convey
   exalted views of the glory of Christ that Paul employed those lofty
   titles. As if he had said, "There is nothing so elevated or excellent,
   by whatever name it may be named, that is not subject to the majesty of
   Christ." There was an ancient superstition, prevalent both among Jews
   and Gentiles, falsely attributing to angels many things, in order to
   draw away their minds from God himself, and from the true Mediator.
   Paul constantly labors to prevent this imaginary lustre of angels from
   dazzling the eyes of men, or obscuring the brightness of Christ; and
   yet his utmost exertions could not prevent "the wiles of the
   devil"(Ephesians 6:11) from succeeding in this matter. Thus we see how
   the world, through a superstitious dread of angels, departed from
   Christ. It was indeed the unavoidable consequence of the false opinions
   entertained respecting angels, that the pure knowledge of Christ
   disappeared.

   Above every name that is named. Name is here taken for largeness, or
   excellence; and to be named means to enjoy celebrity and praise. The
   age that is to come is expressly mentioned, to point out that the
   exalted rank of Christ is not temporal, but eternal; and that it is not
   limited to this world, but shines illustriously in the kingdom of God.
   For this reason, too, Isaiah calls him, (Isaiah 9:6,) The Father of the
   future age. In short, the glories of men and angels are made to hold an
   inferior place, that the glory of Christ, unequalled and unapproached,
   may shine above them all.

   22. And gave him to be the head. He was made the head of the Church, on
   the condition that he should have the administration of all things. The
   apostle shews that it was not a mere honorary title, but was
   accompanied by the entire command and government of the universe. The
   metaphor of a head denotes the highest authority. I am unwilling to
   dispute about a name, but we are driven to it by the base conduct of
   those who flatter the Romish idol. Since Christ alone is called "the
   head," all others, whether angels or men, must rank as members; so that
   he who holds the highest place among his fellows is still one of the
   members of the same body. And yet they are not ashamed to make an open
   avowal that the Church will be akephalon, without a head, if it has not
   another head on earth besides Christ. So small is the respect which
   they pay to Christ, that, if he obtain undivided that honor which his
   Father has bestowed upon him, the Church is supposed to be disfigured.
   This is the basest sacrilege. But let us listen to the Apostle, who
   declares that the Church is His body, and, consequently, that those who
   refuse to submit to Him are unworthy of its communion; for on Him alone
   the unity of the Church depends.

   23. The fullness of him that filleth all in all. This is the highest
   honor of the Church, that, until He is united to us, the Son of God
   reckons himself in some measure imperfect. What consolation is it for
   us to learn, that, not until we are along with him, does he possess all
   his parts, or wish to be regarded as complete! Hence, in the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians, [1Co 12:12-31] when the apostle discusses
   largely the metaphor of a human body, he includes under the single name
   of Christ the whole Church.

   That filleth all in all. This is added to guard against the supposition
   that any real defect would exist in Christ, if he were separated from
   us. His wish to be filled, and, in some respects, made perfect in us,
   arises from no want or necessity; for all that is good in ourselves, or
   in any of the creatures, is the gift of his hand; and his goodness
   appears the more remarkably in raising us out of nothing, that he, in
   like manner, may dwell and live in us. There is no impropriety in
   limiting the word all to its application to this passage; for, though
   all things are regulated by the will and power of Christ, yet the
   subject of which Paul particularly speaks is the spiritual government
   of the Church. There is nothing, indeed, to hinder us from viewing it
   as referring to the universal government of the world; but to limit it
   to the case in hand is the more probable interpretation.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ephesians 2:1-3

   1. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;

   1. Et vos, quum essetis mortui delictis et peccatis vestris;

   2. Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
   world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that
   now worketh in the children of disobedience:

   2. In quibus aliquando ambulastis secundum saeculum mundi hujus,
   secundum principem potestatis aeris, spiritus scilicet, qui nunc
   operatur in filiis inobedientiae;

   3. Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the
   lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
   mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

   3. Inter quos nos quoque omnes aliquando conversati sumus in
   concupiscentiis carnis nostrae, facientes quae carni libebant, et
   menti; et eramus natura filii irae, sicut et caeteri.


   1. And you who were dead. This is an epexergasia of the former
   statements, that is, an exposition accompanied by an illustration.
   [118] To bring home more effectually to the Ephesians the general
   doctrine of Divine grace, he reminds them of their former condition.
   This application consists of two parts. "Ye were formerly lost; but now
   God, by his grace, has rescued you from destruction." And here we must
   observe, that, in laboring to give an impressive view of both of these
   parts, the apostle makes a break in the style by (huperbaton) a
   transposition. There is some perplexity in the language; but, if we
   attend carefully to what the apostle says about those two parts, the
   meaning is clear. As to the first, he says that they were dead; and
   states, at the same time, the cause of the death -- trespasses and
   sins. [119] He does not mean simply that they were in danger of death;
   but he declares that it was a real and present death under which they
   labored. As spiritual death is nothing else than the alienation of the
   soul from God, we are all born as dead men, and we live as dead men,
   until we are made partakers of the life of Christ, -- agreeably to the
   words of our Lord,

   "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
   the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." (John 5:25)

   The Papists, who are eager to seize every opportunity of undervaluing
   the grace of God, say, that while we are out of Christ, we are half
   dead. But we are not at liberty to set aside the declarations of our
   Lord and of the Apostle Paul, that, while we remain in Adam, we are
   entirely devoid of life; and that regeneration is a new life of the
   soul, by which it rises from the dead. Some kind of life, I
   acknowledge, does remain in us, while we are still at a distance from
   Christ; for unbelief does not altogether destroy the outward senses, or
   the will, or the other faculties of the soul. But what has this to do
   with the kingdom of God? What has it to do with a happy life, so long
   as every sentiment of the mind, and every act of the will, is death?
   Let this, then, be held as a fixed principle, that the union of our
   soul with God is the true and only life; and that out of Christ we are
   altogether dead, because sin, the cause of death, reigns in us.

   2. In which for some time ye walked. From the effects or fruits, he
   draws a proof that sin formerly reigned in them; for, until sin
   displays itself in outward acts, men are not sufficiently aware of its
   power. When he adds, according to the course of this world, [120] he
   intimates that the death which he had mentioned rages in the nature of
   man, and is a universal disease. He does not mean that course of the
   world which God has ordained, nor the elements, such as the heaven, and
   earth, and air, -- but the depravity with which we are all infected; so
   that sin is not peculiar to a few, but pervades the whole world.

   According to the prince of the power of the air. He now proceeds
   farther, and explains the cause of our corruption to be the dominion
   which the devil exercises over us. A more severe condemnation of
   mankind could not have been pronounced. What does he leave to us, when
   he declares us to be the slaves of Satan, and subject to his will, so
   long as we live out of the kingdom of Christ? Our condition, therefore,
   though many treat it with ridicule, or, at least, with little
   disapprobation, may well excite our horror. Where is now the free-will,
   the guidance of reason, the moral virtue, about which Papists babble to
   much? What will they find that is pure or holy under the tyranny of the
   devil? On this subject, indeed, they are extremely cautious, and
   denounce this doctrine of Paul as a grievous heresy. I maintain, on the
   contrary, that there is no obscurity in the apostle's language; and
   that all men who live according to the world, that is, according to the
   inclinations of their flesh, are here declared to fight under the reign
   of Satan.

   In accordance with the practice of the inspired writers, the Devil is
   mentioned in the singular number. As the children of God have one head,
   so have the wicked; for each of the classes forms a distinct body. By
   assigning to him the dominion over all wicked beings, ungodliness is
   represented as an unbroken mass. As to his attributing to the devil
   power over the air, that will be considered when we come to the sixth
   chapter. At present, we shall merely advert to the strange absurdity of
   the Manicheans, in endeavoring to prove from this passage the existence
   of two principles, as if Satan could do anything without the Divine
   permission. Paul does not allow him the highest authority, which
   belongs to the will of God alone, but merely a tyranny which God
   permits him to exercise. What is Satan but God's executioner to punish
   man's ingratitude? This is implied in Paul's language, when he
   represents the success of Satan as confined to unbelievers; for the
   children of God are thus exempted from his power. If this be true, it
   follows that Satan does nothing but under the control of a superior:
   and that he is not (autokrator) an unlimited monarch.

   We may now draw from it also this inference, that ungodly men have no
   excuse in being driven by Satan to commit all sorts of crimes. Whence
   comes it that they are subject to his tyranny, but because they are
   rebels against God? If none are the slaves of Satan, but those who have
   renounced the service, and refuse to yield to the authority, of God,
   let them blame themselves, for having so cruel a master.

   By the children of disobedience, according to a Hebrew idiom, are meant
   obstinate persons. Unbelief is always accompanied by disobedience; so
   that it is the source -- the mother of all stubbornness.

   3. Among whom also we all had our conversation. Lest it should be
   supposed that what he had now said was a slanderous reproach against
   the former character of the Ephesians, or that Jewish pride had led him
   to treat the Gentiles as an inferior race, he associates himself and
   his countrymen along with them in the general accusation. This is not
   done in hypocrisy, but in a sincere ascription of glory to God. It may
   excite wonder, indeed, that he should speak of himself as having walked
   "in the lusts of the flesh," while, on other occasions, he boasts that
   his life had been throughout irreproachable.

   "Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
   (Philippians 3:6.)

   And again,

   "Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and
   unblamably, we behaved ourselves among you that believe."
   (1 Thessalonians 2:10)

   I reply, the statement applies to all who have not been regenerated by
   the Spirit of Christ. However praiseworthy, in appearance, the life of
   some may be, because their lusts do not break out in the sight of men,
   there is nothing pure or holy which does not proceed from the fountain
   of all purity.

   Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind. To fulfill these
   desires, is to live according to the guidance of our natural
   disposition and of our mind. The flesh means here the disposition, or,
   what is called, the inclination of the nature; and the next expression
   (ton dianoion) means what proceeds from the mind. Now, the mind
   includes reason, such as it exists in men by nature; so that lusts do
   not refer exclusively to the lower appetites, or what is called the
   sensual part of man, but extend to the whole.

   And were by nature [121] children of wrath. All men without exception,
   whether Jews or Gentiles, (Galatians 2:15,16,) are here pronounced to
   be guilty, until they are redeemed by Christ; so that out of Christ
   there is no righteousness, no salvation, and, in short, no excellence.
   Children of wrath are those who are lost, and who deserve eternal
   death. Wrath means the judgment of God; so that the children of wrath
   are those who are condemned before God. Such, the apostle tells us, had
   been the Jews, -- such had been all the excellent men that were now in
   the Church; and they were so by nature, that is, from their very
   commencement, and from their mother's womb.

   This is a remarkable passage, in opposition to the views of the
   Pelagians, and of all who deny original sin. What dwells naturally in
   all is certainly original; but Paul declares that we are all naturally
   liable to condemnation; therefore sin dwells naturally in us, for God
   does not condemn the innocent. Pelagians were wont to object, that sin
   spread from Adam to the whole human race, not by descent, but by
   imitation. But Paul affirms that we are born with sin, as serpents
   bring their venom from the womb. Others who think that it is not in
   reality sin, are not less at variance with Paul's language; for where
   condemnation is, there must unquestionably be sin. It is not with
   blameless men, but with sin, that God is offended. Nor is it wonderful
   that the depravity which we inherit from our parents is reckoned as sin
   before God; for the seeds of sin, before they have been openly
   displayed, are perceived and condemned.

   But one question here arises. Why does Paul represent the Jews, equally
   with others, as subject to wrath and curse, while they were the blessed
   seed? I answer, they have a common nature. Jews differ from Gentiles in
   nothing but this, that, through the grace of the promise, God delivers
   them from destruction; but that is a remedy which came after the
   disease. Another question is, since God is the Author of nature, how
   comes it that no blame attaches to God, if we are lost by nature? I
   answer, there is a twofold nature: the one was produced by God, and the
   other is the corruption of it. This condemnation therefore which Paul
   mentions does not proceed from God, but from a depraved nature: for we
   are not born such as Adam was at first created, we are not

   "wholly a right seed, but are turned into the degenerate"
   (Jeremiah 2:21)

   offspring of a degenerate and sinful man.

   spiritual death, with which they were unacquainted, but the absence of

   Ephesians 2:4-7

   4. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
   us,

   4. Deus autem, qui dives est in misericordia, propter multam suam
   dilectionem, qua nos dilexit,

   5. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
   Christ; (by grace ye are saved;)

   5. Etiam quum essemus mortui peccatis, convivificavit cum Christo;
   (Gratia estis salvati;)

   6. And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
   places in Christ Jesus;

   6. Et simul excitavit, et sedere fecit in coelestibus in Christo Iesu,

   7. That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
   grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

   7. Ut demonstraret in saeculis supervenientibus exsuperantes divitias
   gratiae suae, in benignitate erga nos in Christo Iesu.


   4. But God, who is rich in mercy. [122] Now follows the second member
   of the sentence, the substance of which is, that God had delivered the
   Ephesians from the destruction to which they were formerly liable; but
   the words which he employs are different. God, who is rich in mercy,
   hath quickened you together with Christ. The meaning is, that, there is
   no other life than that which is breathed into us by Christ: so that we
   begin to live only when we are ingrafted into him, and enjoy the same
   life with himself. This enables us to see what the apostle formerly
   meant by death, for that death and this resurrection are brought into
   contrast. To be made partakers of the life of the Son of God, -- to be
   quickened by one Spirit, is an inestimable privilege.

   On this ground he praises the mercy of God, meaning by its riches, that
   it had been poured out in a singularly large and abundant manner. The
   whole of our salvation is here ascribed to the mercy of God. But he
   presently adds, for his great love wherewith he loved us. [123] This is
   a still more express declaration, that all was owing to undeserved
   goodness; for he declares that God was moved by this single
   consideration. "Herein," says John, "is love, not that we loved God,
   but that he loved us. -- We love him because he first loved us." (1
   John 4:10,19.)

   5. Even when we were dead in sin. These words have the same emphasis as
   similar expressions in another Epistle.

   "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died, for
   the ungodly. -- But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while
   we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
   (Romans 5:6,8.)

   Whether the words, by grace ye are saved, have been inserted by another
   hand, I know not; but, as they are perfectly agreeable to the context,
   I am quite willing to receive them as written by Paul. They show us
   that he always feels as if he had not sufficiently proclaimed the
   riches of Divine grace, and accordingly expresses, by a variety of
   terms, the same truth, that everything connected with our salvation
   ought to be ascribed to God as its author. And certainly he who duly
   weighs the ingratitude of men will not complain that this parenthesis
   is superfluous.

   6. And hath raised us up together. The resurrection and sitting in
   heaven, which are here mentioned, are not yet seen by mortal eyes. Yet,
   as if those blessings were presently in our possession, he states that
   we have received them; and illustrates the change which has taken place
   in our condition, when we were led from Adam to Christ. It is as if we
   had been brought from the deepest hell to heaven itself. And certainly,
   although, as respects ourselves, our salvation is still the object of
   hope, yet in Christ we already possess a blessed immortality and glory;
   and therefore, he adds, in Christ Jesus. Hitherto it does not appear in
   the members, but only in the head; yet, in consequence of the secret
   union, it belongs truly to the members. Some render it, through Christ;
   but, for the reason which has been mentioned, it is better to retain
   the usual rendering, in Christ. We are thus furnished with the richest
   consolation. Of everything which we now want, we have a sure pledge and
   foretaste in the person of Christ.

   7. That in the ages to come. The final and true cause -- the glory of
   God -- is again mentioned, that the Ephesians, by making it the subject
   of earnest study, might be more fully assured of their salvation. He
   likewise adds, that it was the design of God to hallow, in all ages,
   the remembrance of so great goodness. This exhibits still more strongly
   the hateful character of those by whom the free calling of the Gentiles
   was attacked; for they were endeavoring instantly to crush that scheme
   which was destined to be remembered through all ages. But we, too, are
   instructed by it, that the mercy of God, who was pleased to admit our
   fathers into the number of his own people, deserves to be held in
   everlasting remembrance. The calling of the Gentiles is an astonishing
   work of divine goodness, which ought to be handed down by parents to
   children, and to their children's children, that it may never be
   forgotten or unacknowledged by the sons of men.

   The riches of his grace in his kindness. The love of God to us in
   Christ is here proved, or again declared, to have had its origin in
   mercy. That he might shew, says he, the exceeding riches of his grace.
   How? In his kindness towards us, as the tree is known by its fruit. Not
   only, therefore, does he declare, that the love of God was free, but
   likewise that God displayed in it the riches, -- the extraordinary
   pre-eminent riches of his grace. It deserves notice, also, that the
   name of Christ is repeated; for no grace, no love, must be expected by
   us from God, except through his mediation.

   Ephesians 2:8-10

   8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
   it is the gift of God:

   8. Gratia enim estis salvati per fidem; idque non ex vobis: Dei donum
   est.

   9. Not of works, lest any man should boast.

   9. Non ex operibus; ne quis glorietur.

   10. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

   10. Ipsius enim opus sumus, creati in Christo Iesu ad opera bona, quae
   praeparavit Deus, ut in illis ambulemus.


   8. For by grace are ye saved. This is an inference from the former
   statements. Having treated of election and of effectual calling, he
   arrives at this general conclusion, that they had obtained salvation by
   faith alone. First, he asserts, that the salvation of the Ephesians was
   entirely the work, the gracious work of God. But then they had obtained
   this grace by faith. On one side, we must look at God; and, on the
   other, at man. God declares, that he owes us nothing; so that salvation
   is not a reward or recompense, but unmixed grace. The next question is,
   in what way do men receive that salvation which is offered to them by
   the hand of God? The answer is, by faith; and hence he concludes that
   nothing connected with it is our own. If, on the part of God, it is
   grace alone, and if we bring nothing but faith, which strips us of all
   commendation, it follows that salvation does not come from us.

   Ought we not then to be silent about free-will, and good intentions,
   and fancied preparations, and merits, and satisfactions? There is none
   of these which does not claim a share of praise in the salvation of
   men; so that the praise of grace would not, as Paul shews, remain
   undiminished. When, on the part of man, the act of receiving salvation
   is made to consist in faith alone, all other means, on which men are
   accustomed to rely, are discarded. Faith, then, brings a man empty to
   God, that he may be filled with the blessings of Christ. And so he
   adds, not of yourselves; that claiming nothing for themselves, they may
   acknowledge God alone as the author of their salvation.

   9. Not of works. Instead of what he had said, that their salvation is
   of grace, he now affirms, that "it is the gift of God." [124] Instead
   of what he had said, "Not of yourselves," he now says, "Not of works."
   Hence we see, that the apostle leaves nothing to men in procuring
   salvation. In these three phrases, -- not of yourselves, -- it is the
   gift of God, -- not of works, -- he embraces the substance of his long
   argument in the Epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians, that
   righteousness comes to us from the mercy of God alone, -- is offered to
   us in Christ by the gospel, -- and is received by faith alone, without
   the merit of works.

   This passage affords an easy refutation of the idle cavil by which
   Papists attempt to evade the argument, that we are justified without
   works. Paul, they tell us, is speaking about ceremonies. But the
   present question is not confined to one class of works. Nothing can be
   more clear than this. The whole righteousness of man, which consists in
   works, -- nay, the whole man, and everything that he can call his own,
   is set aside. We must attend to the contrast between God and man, --
   between grace and works. Why should God be contrasted with man, if the
   controversy related to nothing more than ceremonies?

   Papists themselves are compelled to own that Paul ascribes to the grace
   of God the whole glory of our salvation, but endeavor to do away with
   this admission by another contrivance. This mode of expression, they
   tell us, is employed, because God bestows the first grace. It is really
   foolish to imagine that they can succeed in this way, since Paul
   excludes man and his utmost ability, -- not only from the commencement,
   but throughout, -- from the whole work of obtaining salvation.

   But it is still more absurd to overlook the apostle's inference, lest
   any man should boast. Some room must always remain for man's boasting,
   so long as, independently of grace, merits are of any avail. Paul's
   doctrine is overthrown, unless the whole praise is rendered to God
   alone and to his mercy. And here we must advert to a very common error
   in the interpretation of this passage. Many persons restrict the word
   gift to faith alone. But Paul is only repeating in other words the
   former sentiment. His meaning is, not that faith is the gift of God,
   but that salvation is given to us by God, or, that we obtain it by the
   gift of God.

   10. For we are his work. By setting aside the contrary supposition, he
   proves his statement, that by grace we are saved, -- that we have no
   remaining works by which we can merit salvation; for all the good works
   which we possess are the fruit of regeneration. Hence it follows, that
   works themselves are a part of grace.

   When he says, that "we are the work of God," this does not refer to
   ordinary creation, by which we are made men. We are declared to be new
   creatures, because, not by our own power, but by the Spirit of Christ,
   we have been formed to righteousness. This applies to none but
   believers. As the descendants of Adam, they were wicked and depraved;
   but by the grace of Christ, they are spiritually renewed, and become
   new men. Everything in us, therefore, that is good, is the supernatural
   gift of God. The context explains his meaning. We are his work, because
   we have been created, -- not in Adam, but in Christ Jesus, -- not to
   every kind of life, but to good works.

   What remains now for free-will, if all the good works which proceed
   from us are acknowledged to have been the gifts of the Spirit of God?
   Let godly readers weigh carefully the apostle's words. He does not say
   that we are assisted by God. He does not say that the will is prepared,
   and is then left to run by its own strength. He does not say that the
   power of choosing aright is bestowed upon us, and that we are
   afterwards left to make our own choice. Such is the idle talk in which
   those persons who do their utmost to undervalue the grace of God are
   accustomed to indulge. But the apostle affirms that we are God's work,
   and that everything good in us is his creation; by which he means that
   the whole man is formed by his hand to be good. It is not the mere
   power of choosing aright, or some indescribable kind of preparation, or
   even assistance, but the right will itself, which is his workmanship;
   otherwise Paul's argument would have no force. He means to prove that
   man does not in any way procure salvation for himself, but obtains it
   as a free gift from God. The proof is, that man is nothing but by
   divine grace. Whoever, then, makes the very smallest claim for man,
   apart from the grace of God, allows him, to that extent, ability to
   procure salvation.

   Created to good works. They err widely from Paul's intention, who
   torture this passage for the purpose of injuring the righteousness of
   faith. Ashamed to affirm in plain terms, and aware that they could gain
   nothing by affirming, that we are not justified by faith, they shelter
   themselves under this kind of subterfuge. "We are justified by faith,
   because faith, by which we receive the grace of God, is the
   commencement of righteousness; but we are made righteous by
   regeneration, because, being renewed by the Spirit of God, we walk in
   good works." In this manner they make faith the door by which we enter
   into righteousness, but imagine that we obtain it by our works, or, at
   least, they define righteousness to be that uprightness by which a man
   is formed anew to a holy life. I care not how old this error may be;
   but they err egregiously who endeavor to support it by this passage.

   We must look to Paul's design. He intends to shew that we have brought
   nothing to God, by which he might be laid under obligations to us; and
   he shews that even the good works which we perform have come from God.
   Hence it follows, that we are nothing, except through the pure exercise
   of his kindness. Those men, on the other hand, infer that the half of
   our justification arises from works. But what has this to do with
   Paul's intention, or with the subject which he handles? It is one thing
   to inquire in what righteousness consists, and another thing to follow
   up the doctrine, that it is not from ourselves, by this argument, that
   we have no right to claim good works as our own, but have been formed
   by the Spirit of God, through the grace of Christ, to all that is good.
   When Paul lays down the cause of justification, he dwells chiefly on
   this point, that our consciences will never enjoy peace till they rely
   on the propitiation for sins. Nothing of this sort is even alluded to
   in the present instance. His whole object is to prove, that,

   "by the grace of God, we are all that we are."
   (1 Corinthians 15:10)

   Which God hath prepared Beware of applying this, as the Pelagians do,
   to the instruction of the law; as if Paul's meaning were, that God
   commands what is just, and lays down a proper rule of life. Instead of
   this, he follows up the doctrine which he had begun to illustrate, that
   salvation does not proceed from ourselves. He says, that, before we
   were born, the good works were prepared by God; meaning, that in our
   own strength we are not able to lead a holy life, but only so far as we
   are formed and adapted by the hand of God. Now, if the grace of God
   came before our performances, all ground of boasting has been taken
   away. Let us carefully observe the word prepared. On the simple ground
   of the order of events, Paul rests the proof that, with respect to good
   works, God owes us nothing. How so? Because they were drawn out of his
   treasures, in which they had long before been laid up; for whom he
   called, them he justifies and regenerates.

   Ephesians 2:11-13

   11. Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
   flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the
   Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

   11. Quamobrem memores estote, quod aliquando vos Gentes in carne, qui
   dicebamini Praeputium ab ea, quae vocatur Circumcisio, in carne manu
   facta;

   12. That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,
   having no hope, and without God in the world:

   12. Illo tempore eratis absque Christo, alienati a republica Israelis,
   hospites tabularum promissionis, spem non habentes, et sine Deo in
   mundo.

   13. But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made
   nigh by the blood of Christ.

   13. Nunc autem in Christo Iesu vos, qui quondam eratis procul, facti
   estis propinqui per Christi sanguinem.


   11. Wherefore remember. The apostle never once loses sight of his
   subject, marks it out clearly, and pursues it with increasing
   earnestness. He again exhorts the Ephesians to remember what their
   character had been before they were called. This consideration was
   fitted to convince them that they had no reason to be proud. He
   afterwards points out the method of reconciliation, that they might
   rest with perfect satisfaction on Christ alone, and not imagine that
   other aids were necessary. The first clause may be thus summed up:
   "Remember that, when ye were uncircumcised, ye were aliens from Christ,
   from the hope of salvation, and from the Church and kingdom of God; so
   that ye had no friendly intercourse with God." The second may run thus:
   "But now ingrafted into Christ, ye are at the same time reconciled to
   God." What is implied in both parts of the description, and what effect
   the remembrance of it was fitted to produce on their minds, has been
   already considered.

   Gentiles in the flesh. He first mentions that they had wanted the marks
   of God's people. Circumcision was a token by which the people of God
   were marked out and distinguished from other men: Uncircumcision was
   the mark of a profane person. Since, therefore, God usually connects
   his grace with the sacraments, their want of the sacraments is taken as
   an evidence that neither were they partakers of his grace. The
   argument, indeed, does not hold universally, though it does hold as to
   God's ordinary dispensations. Hence we find the following language:

   "And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know
   good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of
   the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: therefore the Lord God
   sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence
   he was taken. So he drove out the man."
   (Genesis 3:22,23)

   Though he had devoured the whole tree, he would not, by merely eating
   it, have recovered the possession of life; but, by taking away the
   sign, the Lord took from him also life itself. Uncircumcision is thus
   held out to the Ephesians as a mark of pollution. By taking from the
   Ephesians the token of sanctification, he deprives them also of the
   thing signified.

   Some are of opinion, that all these observations are intended to throw
   contempt on outward circumcision; but this is a mistake. At the same
   time, I acknowledge, that the qualifying clause, the Circumcision in
   the flesh made by hands, points out a twofold circumcision. The Jews
   were thus taught that they should no longer indulge in foolish boasting
   about the literal circumcision. The Ephesians, on the other hand, were
   instructed to abstain from all scruples on their own account, since the
   most important privilege--nay, the whole truth expressed by the outward
   sign--was in their possession. He calls it, Uncircumcision in the
   flesh, because they bore the mark of their pollution; but, at the same
   time, he suggests that their uncircumcision was no hinderance to their
   being spiritually circumcised by Christ.

   The words may likewise be read in one clause, Circumcision in the flesh
   made by hands, or in two clauses: Circumcision in the flesh, meaning
   that it was carnal; made by hands, meaning that it was done by the hand
   of man. This kind of circumcision is contrasted with that of the
   Spirit, or of the heart, (Romans 2:29,) which is also called the
   circumcision of Christ. (Colossians 2:11)

   By that which is called. Circumcision may be viewed here either as a
   collective noun for the Jews themselves, or literally for the thing
   itself; and then the meaning would be, that the Gentiles were called
   Uncircumcision, because they wanted the sacred symbol, that is, by way
   of distinction. This latter sense is countenanced by the qualifying
   phrase; but the substance of the argument is little affected.

   12. That at that time ye were without Christ. He now declares that the
   Ephesians had been excluded, not only from the outward badge, but from
   everything necessary to the salvation and happiness of men. As Christ
   is the foundation of hope and of all the promises, he mentions, first
   of all, that they were without Christ. But for him that is without
   Christ, there remains nothing but destruction. On Him the commonwealth
   of Israel was founded; and in whom, but in Himself, could the people of
   God be collected into one holy society?

   A similar observation might be made as to the tables of the promise On
   one great promise made to Abraham all the others hang, and without it
   they lose all their value:

   "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
   (Genesis 22:18.)

   Hence our apostle says elsewhere,

   "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen."
   (2 Corinthians 1:20.)

   Take away the covenant of salvation, and there remains no hope. I have
   translated ton diathekon by the tables, or, in ordinary legal phrase,
   the instruments. By solemn ritual did God sanction His covenant with
   Abraham and his posterity, that he would be their God for ever and
   ever. (Genesis 15:9.) Tables of this covenant were ratified by the hand
   of Moses, and intrusted, as a peculiar treasure, to the people of
   Israel, to whom, and not to the Gentiles, "pertain the covenants."
   (Romans 9:4.)

   And without God in the world. But at no period were the Ephesians, or
   any other Gentiles, destitute of all religion. Why, then, are they
   styled (atheoi) Atheists? for (atheos) an Atheist, strictly speaking,
   is one who does not believe, and who absolutely ridicules, the being of
   a God. That appellation, certainly, is not usually given to
   superstitious persons, but to those who have no feeling of religion,
   and who desire to see it utterly destroyed. I answer, Paul was right in
   giving them this name, for he treated all the notions entertained
   respecting false gods as nothing; and with the utmost propriety do
   godly persons regard all idols as "nothing in the world." (1
   Corinthians 8:4.) Those who do not worship the true God, whatever may
   be the variety of their worship, or the multitude of laborious
   ceremonies which they perform, are without God: they adore what they
   know not. (Acts 17:23.) Let it be carefully observed, that the
   Ephesians are not charged with (atheismos) Atheism, in the same degree
   as Diagoras, and others of the same stamp, who were subjected to that
   reproach. Persons who imagined themselves to be very religious are
   charged with that crime; for an idol is a forgery, an imposition, not a
   Divinity.

   From what has been said, the conclusion will be easily drawn, that out
   of Christ there are none but idols. Those who were formerly declared to
   be without Christ, are now declared to be without God; [125] as John
   says,

   "Whosoever hath not the Son, hath not the Father,"
   (1 John 2:23;)

   and again,

   "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
   hath not God."
   (2 John 1:9.)

   Let us know, therefore, that all who do not keep this way wander from
   the true God. We shall next be asked, Did God never reveal himself to
   any of the Gentiles? I answer, no manifestation of God without Christ
   was ever made among the Gentiles, any more than among the Jews. It is
   not to one age only, or to one nation, that the saying of our Lord
   applies,

   "I am the way;" for he adds, "no man cometh
   unto the Father but by me." (John 14:6.)

   13. But now in Christ Jesus. We must either supply the verb, now that
   ye have been received in Christ Jesus, or connect the word now with the
   conclusion of the verse, now through the blood of Christ, -- which will
   be a still clearer exposition. In either case, the meaning is, that the
   Ephesians, who were far off from God and from salvation, had been
   reconciled to God through Christ, and made nigh by his blood; for the
   blood of Christ has taken away the enmity which existed between them
   and God, and from being enemies hath made them sons.

   Ephesians 2:14-16

   14. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
   the middle wall of partition between us;

   14. Ipse enim est pax nostra, qui fecit utraque unum, et interstitium
   maceriae solvens, inimicitias in carne sua;

   15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
   one new man, so making peace;

   15. Legem mandatorum in decretis positam abolens, ut duos conderet in
   se ipso, in unum novum hominem, faciens pacem;

   16. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross,
   having slain the enmity thereby.

   16. Ut reconciliaret ambos in uno corpore Deo per crucem, inimicitias
   in ipsa interimens.


   14. For he is our peace. He now includes Jews in the privilege of
   reconciliation, and shows that, through one Messiah, all are united to
   God. This consideration was fitted to repress the false confidence of
   the Jews, who, despising the grace of Christ, boasted that they were
   the holy people, and chosen inheritance, of God. If Christ is our
   peace, all who are out of him must be at variance with God. What a
   beautiful title is this which Christ possesses, -- the peace between
   God and men! Let no one who dwells in Christ entertain a doubt that he
   is reconciled to God.

   Who hath made both one. This distinction was necessary. [126] All
   intercourse with the Gentiles was held to be inconsistent with their
   own superior claims. [127] To subdue this pride, he tells them that
   they and the Gentiles have been united into one body. Put all these
   things together, and you will frame the following syllogism: If the
   Jews wish to enjoy peace with God, they must have Christ as their
   Mediator. But Christ will not be their peace in any other way than by
   making them one body with the Gentiles. Therefore, unless the Jews
   admit the Gentiles to fellowship with them, they have no friendship
   with God.

   And breaking down the middle wall of partition. To understand this
   passage, two things must be observed. The Jews were separated, for a
   certain time, from the Gentiles, by the appointment of God; and
   ceremonial observances were the open and avowed symbols of that
   separation. Passing by the Gentiles, God had chosen the Jews to be a
   peculiar people to himself. A wide distinction was thus made, when the
   one class were "fellow-citizens and of the household" (Ephesians 2:19)
   of the Church, and the other were foreigners. This is stated in the
   Song of Moses:

   "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
   separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according
   to the number of the children of Israel: for the Lord's portion is his
   people, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." (Deuteronomy 32:8,9)

   Bounds were thus fixed by God to separate one people from the rest; and
   hence arose the enmity which is here mentioned. A separation is thus
   made. The Gentiles are set aside. God is pleased to choose and sanctify
   the Jewish people, by freeing them from the ordinary pollution of
   mankind. Ceremonial observances were afterwards added, which, like
   walls, enclosed the inheritance of God, prevented it from being open to
   all or mixed with other possessions, and thus excluded the Gentiles
   from the kingdom of God.

   But now, the apostle, says, the enmity is removed, and the wall is
   broken down. By extending the privilege of adoption beyond the limits
   of Judea, Christ has now made us all to be brethren. And so is
   fulfilled the prophecy,

   "God shall enlarge Japheth,
   and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem." (Genesis 9:27)

   15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity. The meaning of Paul's
   words is now clear. The middle wall of partition hindered Christ from
   forming Jews and Gentiles into one body, and therefore the wall has
   been broken down. The reason why it is broken down is now added -- to
   abolish the enmity, by the flesh of Christ. The Son of God, by assuming
   a nature common to all, has formed in his own body a perfect unity.

   Even the law of commandments contained in ordinances. What had been
   metaphorically understood by the word wall is now more plainly
   expressed. The ceremonies, by which the distinction was declared, have
   been abolished through Christ. What were circumcision, sacrifices,
   washings, and abstaining from certain kinds of food, but symbols of
   sanctification, reminding the Jews that their lot was different from
   that of other nations; just as the white and the red cross distinguish
   the French of the present day from the inhabitants of Burgundy. Paul
   declares not only that the Gentiles are equally with the Jews admitted
   to the fellowship of grace, so that they no longer differ from each
   other, but that the mark of difference has been taken away; for
   ceremonies have been abolished. If two contending nations were brought
   under the dominion of one prince, he would not only desire that they
   should live in harmony, but would remove the badges and marks of their
   former enmity. When an obligation is discharged, the handwriting is
   destroyed, -- a metaphor which Paul employs on this very subject in
   another Epistle. [128] (Colossians 2:14.)

   Some interpreters, [129] -- though, in my opinion, erroneously, --
   connect the words, in ordinances, with abolished, making the ordinances
   to be the act of abolishing the ceremonies. This is Paul's ordinary
   phrase for describing the ceremonial law, in which the Lord not only
   enjoined upon the Jews a simple rule of life, but also bound them by
   various statutes. It is evident, too, that Paul is here treating
   exclusively of the ceremonial law; for the moral law is not a wall of
   partition separating us from the Jews, but lays down instructions in
   which the Jews were not less deeply concerned than ourselves. This
   passage affords the means of refuting an erroneous view held by some,
   that circumcision and all the ancient rites, though they are not
   binding on the Gentiles, are in force at the present day upon the Jews.
   On this principle there would still be a middle wall of partition
   between us, which is proved to be false.

   That he might make in himself. When the apostle says, in himself, he
   turns away the Ephesians from viewing the diversity of men, and bids
   them look for unity nowhere but in Christ. To whatever extent the two
   might differ in their former condition, in Christ they are become one
   man. But he emphatically adds, one new man, intimating (what he
   explains at greater length on another occasion) that

   "neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision, availeth anything,"
   (Galatians 6:15,)

   but that "a new creature" holds the first and the last place. The
   principle which cements them is spiritual regeneration. If then we are
   all renewed by Christ, let the Jews no longer congratulate themselves
   on their ancient condition, but let them be ready to admit that, both
   in themselves and in others, Christ is all.

   16. And that he might reconcile both. The reconciliation between
   ourselves which has now been described is not the only advantage which
   we derive from Christ. We have been brought back into favor with God.
   The Jews are thus led to consider that they have not less need of a
   Mediator than the Gentiles. Without this, neither the Law, nor
   ceremonies, nor their descent from Abraham, nor all their dazzling
   prerogatives, would be of any avail. We are all sinners; and
   forgiveness of sins cannot be obtained but through the grace of Christ.
   He adds, in one body, to inform the Jews, that to cultivate union with
   the Gentiles will be well-pleasing in the sight of God.

   By the cross. The word cross is added, to point out the propitiatory
   sacrifice. Sin is the cause of enmity between God and us; and, until it
   is removed, we shall not be restored to the Divine favor. It has been
   blotted out by the death of Christ, in which he offered himself to the
   Father as an expiatory victim. There is another reason, indeed, why the
   cross is mentioned here, as it is through the cross that all ceremonies
   have been abolished. Accordingly, he adds, slaying the enmity thereby.
   These words, which unquestionably relate to the cross, may admit of two
   senses, -- either that Christ, by his death, has turned away from us
   the Father's anger, or that, having redeemed both Jews and Gentiles, he
   has brought them back into one flock. The latter appears to be the more
   probable interpretation, as it agrees with a former clause, abolishing
   in his flesh the enmity. (Ephesians 2:15.)

   Ephesians 2:17-22

   17. And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them
   that were nigh.

   17. Et veniens evangelizavit pacem vobis, qui eratis procul, et pacem
   iis qui propinqui erant;

   18. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

   18. Quoniam per ipsum habemus accessum ambo in uno spiritu ad Patrem.

   19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
   fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

   19. Ergo non amplius estis hospites et inquilini; sed cives sanctorum
   et domestici Dei,

   20. And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
   Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone;

   20. Superaedificati fundamento Apostolorum et Prophetarum, cujus lapis
   summus angularis est ipse Christus;

   21. In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an
   holy temple in the Lord:

   21. In quo totum aedificium coagmentatum crescit in templum sanctum in
   Domino;

   22. In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
   through the Spirit.

   22. In quo et vos coaedificamini in habitaculum Dei in Spiritu.


   17. And came and preached peace. All that Christ had done towards
   effecting a reconciliation would have been of no service, if it had not
   been proclaimed by the gospel; and therefore he adds, that the fruit of
   this peace has now been offered both to Jews and to Gentiles. Hence it
   follows, that to save Gentiles as well as Jews was the design of our
   Savior's coming, as the preaching of the gospel, which is addressed
   indiscriminately to both, makes abundantly manifest. The same order is
   followed in the second Epistle to the Corinthians.

   "He hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. Now, then, we are
   ambassadors for Christ. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew
   no sin." (2 Corinthians 5:18-21.)

   Salvation through the death of Christ is first announced, and a
   description is afterwards given of the manner in which Christ
   communicates to us himself and the benefit of his death. But here Paul
   dwells chiefly on this circumstance, that Gentiles are united with Jews
   in the Kingdom of God. Having already represented Christ as a Savior
   common to both, he now speaks of them as companions in the gospel. The
   Jews, though they possessed the law, needed the gospel also; and God
   had bestowed upon the Gentiles equal grace. Those therefore whom

   "God hath joined together, let no man put asunder."
   (Matthew 19:6.)

   No reference to distance of place is conveyed by the words afar off and
   nigh. The Jews, in respect of the covenant, were nigh to God. The
   Gentiles, so long as they had no promise of salvation, were afar off--
   were banished from the kingdom of God.

   And preached peace; not indeed by his own lips, but by the apostles. It
   was necessary that Christ should rise from the dead, before the
   Gentiles were called to the fellowship of grace. Hence that saying of
   our Lord,

   "I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
   (Matthew 15:24.)

   The apostles were forbidden, while he was still in the world, to carry
   their first embassy to the Gentiles.

   "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
   Samaritans, enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house
   of Israel." (Matthew 10:5,6,)

   His apostles were afterwards employed as trumpets for proclaiming the
   gospel to the Gentiles. What they did, not only in his name, and by his
   command, but as it were in his own person, is justly ascribed to none
   other than himself. We too speak as if Christ himself exhorted you by
   us. (2 Corinthians 5:20) The faith of the gospel would be weak indeed,
   were we to look no higher than to men. Its whole authority is derived
   from viewing men as God's instruments, and hearing Christ speak to us
   by their mouth. Observe here, the gospel is the message of peace, by
   which God declares himself to be reconciled to us, and makes known his
   paternal love. Take away the gospel, and war and enmity continue to
   subsist between God and men; and, on the other hand, the native
   tendency of the gospel is, to give peace and calmness to the
   conscience, which would otherwise be tormented by distressing alarm.

   18. For through him we both have access. This is an argument from the
   fact, that we are permitted to draw near to God. But it may be viewed
   also as an announcement of peace; for wicked men, lulled into a
   profound sleep, sometimes deceive themselves by false notions of peace,
   but are never at rest, except when they have learned to forget the
   Divine judgment, and to keep themselves at the greatest possible
   distance from God. It was necessary, therefore, to explain the true
   nature of evangelical peace, which is widely different from a stupefied
   conscience, from false confidence, from proud boasting, from ignorance
   of our own wretchedness. It is a settled composure, which leads us not
   to dread, but to desire and seek, the face of God. Now, it is Christ
   who opens the door to us, yea, who is himself the door. (John 10:9.) As
   this is a double door thrown open for the admission both of Jews and
   Gentiles, we are led to view God as exhibiting to both his fatherly
   kindness. He adds, by one Spirit; who leads and guides us to Christ,
   and "by whom we cry, Abba, Father," (Romans 8:15,) for hence arises the
   boldness of approach. Jews had various means of drawing near to God;
   now all have but one way, to be led by the Spirit of God.

   19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers. The Ephesians are now
   exclusively addressed. They were formerly strangers from the covenants
   of promise, but their condition was now changed. They were foreigners,
   but God had made them citizens of his church. The high value of that
   honor which God had been pleased to bestow upon them, is expressed in a
   variety of language. They are first called fellow-citizens with the
   saints, -- next, of the household of God, -- and lastly, stones
   properly fitted into the building of the temple of the Lord. The first
   appellation is taken from the comparison of the church to a state,
   which occurs very frequently in Scripture. Those who were formerly
   profane, and utterly unworthy to associate with godly persons, have
   been raised to distinguished honor in being admitted to be members of
   the same community with Abraham, -- with all the holy patriarchs, and
   prophets, and kings, -- nay, with the angels themselves. To be of the
   household of God, which is the second comparison, suggests equally
   exalted views of their present condition. God has admitted them into
   his own family; for the church is God's house.

   20. And are built. The third comparison illustrates the manner in which
   the Ephesians, and all other Christians are admitted to the honor of
   being fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God. They
   are built on the foundation, -- they are founded on the doctrine, of
   the apostles and prophets. We are thus enabled to distinguish between a
   true and a false church. This is of the greatest importance; for the
   tendency to error is always strong, and the consequences of mistake are
   dangerous in the extreme. No churches boast more loudly of the name
   than those which bear a false and empty title; as may be seen in our
   own times. To guard us against mistake, the mark of a true church is
   pointed out.

   Foundation, in this passage, unquestionably means doctrine; for no
   mention is made of patriarchs or pious kings, but only of those who
   held the office of teachers, and whom God had appointed to superintend
   the edification of his church. It is laid down by Paul, that the faith
   of the church ought to be founded on this doctrine. What opinion, then,
   must we form of those who rest entirely on the contrivances of men, and
   yet accuse us of revolt, because we embrace the pure doctrine of God?
   But the manner in which it is founded deserves inquiry; for, in the
   strict sense of the term, Christ is the only foundation. He alone
   supports the whole church. He alone is the rule and standard of faith.
   But Christ is actually the foundation on which the church is built by
   the preaching of doctrine; and, on this account, the prophets and
   apostles are called builders. (1 Corinthians 3:10.) Nothing else, Paul
   tells us, was ever intended by the prophets and apostles, than to found
   a church on Christ.

   We shall find this to be true, if we begin with Moses; for "Christ is
   the end of the law," (Romans 10:4,) and the sum of the gospel. Let us
   remember, therefore, that if we wish to be reckoned among believers, we
   must place our reliance on no other: if we wish to make sure progress
   in the knowledge of the Scriptures, to him our whole attention must be
   directed. The same lesson is taught, when we consult the word of God as
   contained in the writings of the prophets and apostles. To shew us how
   we ought to combine them, their harmony is pointed out; for they have a
   common foundation, and labor jointly in building the temple of God.
   Though the apostles have become our teachers, the instruction of the
   prophets has not been rendered superfluous; but one and the same object
   is promoted by both.

   I have been led to make this remark by the conduct of the Marcionites
   in ancient times, who expunged the word prophets from this passage; and
   by that of certain fanatics in the present day, who, following their
   footsteps, exclaim loudly that we have nothing to do with the law and
   the prophets, because the gospel has put an end to their authority. The
   Holy Spirit everywhere declares, that he has spoken to us by the mouth
   of the prophets, and demands that we shall listen to him in their
   writings. This is of no small consequence for maintaining the authority
   of our faith. All the servants of God, from first to last, are so
   perfectly agreed, that their harmony is in itself a clear demonstration
   that it is one God who speaks in them all. The commencement of our
   religion must be traced to the creation of the world. In vain do
   Papists, Mahometans, and other sects, boast of their antiquity, while
   they are mere counterfeits of the true, the pure religion.

   Jesus Christ, himself is the chief corner-stone [130] Those who
   transfer this honor to Peter, and maintain that on him the church is
   founded, are so void of shame, as to attempt to justify their error by
   quoting this passage. They hold out that Christ is called the chief
   corner-stone, by comparison with others; and that there are many stones
   on which the church is founded. But this difficulty is easily solved.
   Various metaphors are employed by the apostles according to the
   diversity of circumstances, but still with the same meaning. In writing
   to the Corinthians, Paul lays down an incontestable proposition, that
   "no other foundation can be laid." (1 Corinthians 3:11.) He does not
   therefore mean, that Christ is merely a corner, or a part of the
   foundation; for then he would contradict himself. What then? He means
   that Jews and Gentiles were two separate walls, but are formed into one
   spiritual building. Christ is placed in the middle of the corner for
   the purpose of uniting both, and this is the force of the metaphor.
   What is immediately added shews sufficiently that he is very far from
   limiting Christ to any one part of the building.

   21. In whom all the building groweth. If this be true, what will become
   of Peter? When Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, speaks of Christ as
   a "Foundation," he does not mean that the church is begun by him and
   completed by others, but draws a distinction arising out of a
   comparison of his own labors with those of other men. It had been his
   duty to found the church at Corinth, and to leave to his successors the
   completion of the building.

   "According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise
   master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth on
   it." (1 Corinthians 3:10.)

   With respect to the present passage, he conveys the instruction, that
   all who are fitly framed together in Christ are the temple of the Lord.
   There is first required a fitting together, that believers may embrace
   and accommodate themselves to each other by mutual intercourse;
   otherwise there would not be a building, but a confused mass. The chief
   part of the symmetry consists in unity of faith. Next follows progress,
   or increase. Those who are not united in faith and love, so as to grow
   in the Lord, belong to a profane building, which has nothing in common
   with the temple of the Lord.

   Groweth unto an holy temple. Individual believers are at other times
   called "temples of the Holy Ghost," (1 Corinthians 6:19; 2 Corinthians
   6:16,) but here all are said to constitute one temple. In both cases
   the metaphor is just and appropriate. When God dwells in each of us, it
   is his will that we should embrace all in holy unity, and that thus he
   should form one temple out of many. Each person, when viewed
   separately, is a temple, but, when joined to others, becomes a stone of
   a temple; and this view is given for the sake of recommending the unity
   of the church.

   22. In whom ye also are builded together, or in whom also Be Ye Builded
   together. The termination of the Greek verb, sunoikodomeisthe, like
   that of the Latin, cooedificamini, does not enable us to determine
   whether it is in the imperative or indicative mood. The context will
   admit either, but I prefer the latter sense. It is, I think, an
   exhortation to the Ephesians to grow more and more in the faith of
   Christ, after having been once founded in it, and thus to form a part
   of that new temple of God, the building of which through the gospel was
   then in progress in every part of the world.

   Through the Spirit. This is again repeated for two reasons: first, to
   remind them that all human exertions are of no avail without the
   operation of the Spirit; and secondly, to point out the superiority of
   the spiritual building to all Jewish and outward services.

   Ephesians 3:1-6

   1. For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
   Gentiles,

   1. Hujus rei gratia ego Paulus, vinctus Iesu Christi, pro vobis
   Gentibus legatione fungor;

   2. (If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is
   given me to you-ward:

   2. Siquidem audistis dispensationem gratiae Dei, mihi erga vos datae,

   3. How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; as I wrote
   afore in few words;

   3. Quod per revelationem mihi patefecerit arcanum, quemadmodum scripsi
   paulo ante.

   4. Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery
   of Christ,

   4. Ad quod potestis attendentes intelligere cognitionem meam in
   mysterio Christi,

   5. Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it
   is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

   5. Quod aliis saeculis non innotuit filiis hominum, quemadmodum nunc
   revelatum est sanctis Apostolis ejus et Prophetis per Spiritum,

   6. That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and
   partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.

   6. Gentes esse cohaeredes, et concorporeas, et consortes promissionis
   ejus in Christo per Evangelium.


   1. For this cause. Paul's imprisonment, which ought to have been held
   as a confirmation of his apostleship, was undoubtedly presented by his
   adversaries in an opposite light. He therefore points out to the
   Ephesians that his chains served to prove and to declare his calling;
   and that the only reason why he had been imprisoned was, that he had
   preached the gospel to the Gentiles. His unshaken firmness was no small
   additional proof that he had discharged his office in a proper manner.

   The prisoner of Jesus Christ. [131] To strengthen his authority still
   more, he speaks in lofty terms of his prison. In the presence of the
   world and of wicked men, this might have appeared to be foolish
   boasting; but, in addressing godly persons, it was a dignified and
   faithful manner. The glory of Christ not only overcomes the ignominy of
   the chains, but converts what was in itself a reproach into the highest
   honor. If he had merely said, "I am a prisoner," this would not have
   conveyed the idea of his being an ambassador. Imprisonment alone has no
   claim to this honor, being usually the mark of wickedness and crime.
   But the crowns and sceptres of kings, to say nothing of the imposing
   splendor of an ambassador, are less honorable than the chains of a
   prisoner of Jesus Christ. Men might think otherwise, but it is our duty
   to judge of the reasons. So highly ought the name of Christ to be
   revered by us, that what men consider to be the greatest reproach,
   ought to be viewed by us as the greatest honour.

   For you Gentiles. Another circumstance greatly fitted to interest the
   Ephesians was, that the persecutions of Paul were endured for the
   Gentiles, -- that his troubles and dangers were on their account.

   2. If ye have heard. There is reason to believe, that, while Paul was
   at Ephesus, he had said nothing on these subjects, no necessity for
   doing so having arisen; for no controversy had taken place among them
   about the calling of the Gentiles. If he had made any mention of them
   in his discourses, he would have reminded the Ephesians of his former
   statements, instead of referring generally, as he now does, to common
   report and to his own Epistle. He did not, of his own accord, raise
   unnecessary disputes. It was only when the wickedness of his
   adversaries made it necessary, that he reluctantly undertook the
   defense of his ministry. Dispensation (oikonomia) means here a divine
   order or command, or, as it is generally expressed, a commission

   3. That by revelation. Some might imagine, that, in attempting to
   discharge the office of an apostle, he had acted rashly, and was now
   paying the penalty of his rashness. It was this that made him so
   earnest in pleading the Divine authority for all his transactions. The
   present instance, on account of its novelty, had few supporters; and
   therefore he calls it a mystery. By this name he endeavors to remove
   the prejudice which the general displeasure at the event was fitted to
   excite. His own personal interest in the matter was less regarded than
   that of the Ephesians, who were deeply concerned in the information,
   that, through the settled purpose of God, they had been called by
   Paul's ministry. Lest what is little known should forthwith become the
   object of suspicion, the word mystery places it in opposition to the
   perverse judgments and opinions which were then prevalent in the world.

   By revelation he made known to me the mystery. Paul draws the line of
   distinction between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and
   to the Holy Spirit their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of
   revelations, but it is a false boast. Paul was persuaded that his
   revelation was true, could prove it to others, and speaks of it as a
   fact of which no doubt could be entertained.

   As I wrote a little before. This refers either to a rapid glance at the
   same subject in the second chapter, or -- which appears to be the
   general opinion -- to another Epistle. If the former exposition be
   adopted, it will be proper to translate, as I wrote before in few
   words; for the subject had received nothing more than a passing notice;
   but the latter being, as I have said, the prevailing opinion, I prefer
   translating, as I wrote a little before. The phrase, (en oligo,) which
   Erasmus has translated in a few words, appears rather to refer to time.
   On this supposition there would be an implied comparison between the
   present and the former writings. But nothing would be more unlike the
   fact, than to contrast them on the score of brevity; for a more concise
   mode of expression than this passing glance can hardly be imagined. The
   phrase, a little before, seems purposely to be used as an appeal to
   their remembrance of a recent occurrence, though I do not insist on
   this point. There is more difficulty in the next verse.

   4. By attending to which, ye may understand, pros ho dunasthe
   anaginoskontes noosai. Erasmus renders it, "from which things, when ye
   read, ye may understand." But to translate anaginoskein ti as
   signifying to read is, I think, at variance with Greek syntax. I leave
   it as a subject of consideration, whether it does not rather signify to
   attend. The participle would then be connected with the preposition
   pros, in the commencement of the verse, and the clause would run thus,
   to which when ye attend, ye may understand If, however, by viewing the
   verb anaginoskontes, as disjoined from the preposition, you make it
   signify reading, the meaning will still be, "by reading you may
   understand according to what I have written;" taking the phrase pros
   ho, to which, as equivalent to kath ' ho, according to which; but I
   suggest this merely as a doubtful conjecture.

   If we adopt the view which is almost universally approved, that the
   apostle had formerly written to the Ephesians, this is not the only
   Epistle which we have lost. And yet there is no room for the sneers of
   the ungodly, as if the Scriptures had been mutilated, or in any part
   had become imperfect. If we duly consider Paul's earnestness, -- his
   watchfulness and care, -- his zeal and fervor, -- his kindness and
   readiness in assisting brethren, -- we shall be led to regard it as
   highly probable that he would write many epistles, both of a public and
   private nature, to various places. Those which the Lord judged to be
   necessary for his church have been selected by his providence for
   everlasting remembrance. Let us rest assured, that what is left is
   enough for us, and that the smallness of the remaining number is not
   the result of accident; but that the body of Scripture, which is in our
   possession, has been adjusted by the wonderful counsel of God.

   My knowledge. The frequent mention of this point shews the necessity
   that the calling of ministers should be firmly believed both by
   themselves and by their people. But Paul looks more to others than to
   himself. He had everywhere indeed given great offense by preaching the
   gospel indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles, but his solicitude was
   not chiefly on his own account. There were not a few who, overwhelmed
   by the slanders of wicked men, began to doubt of his apostleship, and
   whose faith was consequently shaken. It was this that induced him so
   frequently to remind the Ephesians that he knew the will and command of
   God who called him to the office. -- In the mystery of Christ,

   5. Which in other ages was not made known. He had simply called it a
   mystery, but now calls it a mystery of Christ, because it was necessary
   that it should remain hidden, until it was revealed by his coming; just
   as the appellation of "prophecies of Christ" may be given to those
   which relate to his kingdom. We must first explain the word mystery,
   and then inquire why it is said to have remained unknown in all ages.
   The mystery was,

   "that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and
   partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel."
   (Verse 6.)

   When this name is given to the gospel, it has other meanings, which do
   not apply to the present passage. The calling of the Gentiles, then,
   was a "mystery of Christ;" that is, it was to be fulfilled under the
   reign of Christ.

   But why does he affirm that it was not known, when it had been the
   subject of so many predictions? The prophets everywhere declare, that
   people shall come from every nation in the world, to worship God; that
   an altar shall be erected both in Assyria and in Egypt, and that all
   alike shall speak the language of Canaan. (Isaiah 19:18.) It is
   intimated by these words, that the worship of the true God, and the
   same profession of faith, will be everywhere diffused. Of the Messiah
   it is predicted, that he shall have dominion from east to west, and
   that all nations shall serve him. (Psalm 72:8,11.) We see also, that
   many passages to this purpose are quoted by the apostles, not only from
   the later prophets, but from Moses. How could that be hidden which had
   been proclaimed by so many heralds? Why are all without exception
   pronounced to have been in ignorance? Shall we say, that the prophets
   spake what they did not understand, and uttered sounds without meaning?

   I answer, the words of Paul must not be understood to mean that there
   had been no knowledge at all on these subjects. There had always been
   some of the Jewish nation who acknowledged that, at the advent of the
   Messiah, the grace of God would be proclaimed throughout the whole
   world, and who looked forward to the renovation of the human race. The
   prophets themselves, though they spoke with the certainty of
   revelation, left the time and manner undetermined. They knew that some
   communication of the grace of God would be made to the Gentiles, but at
   what time, in what manner, and by what means it should be accomplished,
   they had no information whatever. This ignorance was exemplified in a
   remarkable way by the apostles. They had not only been instructed by
   the predictions of the prophets, but had heard the distinct statement
   of their Master, (John 10:16,)

   "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring,
   and they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one
   shepherd;"

   and yet the novelty of the subject prevented them from understanding it
   fully. Nay, after they had received the injunction,

   "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,"
   (Mark 16:15,)

   and,

   "Ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and
   in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth," (Acts 1:8,)

   they dreaded and recoiled from the calling of the Gentiles as a
   proposal absolutely monstrous, because the manner of its accomplishment
   was still unknown. Before the actual event arrived, they had dark and
   confused apprehensions of our Savior's words; for ceremonies were

   "a vail over their face, that they could not steadfastly look to the
   end of that which is abolished." (2 Corinthians 3:13.)

   With unquestionable propriety, therefore, does Paul call this a
   mystery, and say, that it had been hidden; for the repeal of the
   ceremonial law, which admitted them within the vail, was not
   understood.

   As it is now revealed. To lay claim to information which none of the
   patriarchs, prophets, or holy kings, had possessed, might wear the
   aspect of arrogance. To guard against this imputation, Paul reminds
   them, first, that in this respect he was not alone, but shared the
   revelation with the most eminent teachers of the church; and, secondly,
   that it was the gift of the Holy Spirit, who has a right to bestow it
   on whom he pleases; for there is no other limit of our knowledge but
   that which he assigns to us.

   These few words, as it is now revealed, throw additional light on the
   admission of the Gentiles to be the people of God. It is on the
   condition that they shall be placed on a level with the Jews, and form
   one body. That the novelty might give no offense, he states that this
   must be accomplished by the gospel. (Ephesians 3:6.) Now, the gospel
   was itself a novelty; for it had never till now been heard of, and yet
   was acknowledged by all the godly to have come from heaven. Where,
   then, was the wonder, if, in renewing the world, God should follow an
   unwonted method?

   Ephesians 3:7-13

   7. Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of
   God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

   7. Cujus factus sum minister, secundum donum gratiae Dei, quod mihi
   datum est secundum efficaciam potentiae ejus.

   8. Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
   given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
   of Christ;

   8. Mihi omnium sanctorum minimo data est gratia haec, ut evangelizem in
   Gentibus impervestigabiles divitias Christi;

   9. And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which
   from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all
   things by Jesus Christ:

   9. Et omnibus conspicuum faciam, quae sit communio mysterii, quod
   absconditum fuit a saeculis in Deo, qui omnia creavit per Iesum
   Christum;

   10. To the intent that now, unto the principalities and powers in
   heavenly places, might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of
   God,

   10. Ut nunc patefieret principatibus et potestatibus in coelestibus per
   ecclesiam varie multiplex sapientia Dei,

   11. According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus
   our Lord:

   11. Secundum propositum aeternum, quod statuit in Christo Iesu Domino
   nostro,

   12. In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
   him.

   12. Perquem habemus audaciam, et aditum in fiducia, per fidem ejus.

   13. Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
   which is your glory.

   13. Quare peto, ne deficiatis in afflictionibus meis pro vobis, quae
   est gloria vestra.


   7. Of which I was made a minister. Having declared the gospel to be the
   instrument employed in communicating grace to the Gentiles, he now
   adds, that he was made a minister of the Gospel; and thus applies to
   himself the general statements which had been made. But, to avoid
   claiming for himself more than is proper, he affirms that it is the
   gift of the grace of God, and that this gift was an exhibition of
   divine power. As if he had said, "Inquire not what I have deserved; for
   in the free exercise of kindness, the Lord made me an apostle of the
   Gentiles, not for any excellence of mine, but by his own grace. Inquire
   not what I formerly was; for it is the Lord's prerogative to exalt them
   of low degree.'" (Luke 1:52.) To produce something great out of
   nothing, shews the effectual working of his power.

   8. To me, who am the least. He labors to exhibit himself, and
   everything that belongs to him, in as humiliating a light as possible,
   in order that the grace of God may be the more highly exalted. But this
   acknowledgment had the additional effect of anticipating the objections
   which his adversaries might bring against him. "Who is this man that
   God should have raised him above all his brethren? What superior
   excellence did he possess that he should be chosen in preference to all
   the others?" All such comparisons of personal worth are set aside by
   the confession, that he was the least of all the saints.

   This is no hypocritical declaration. Most men are ready enough to make
   professions of feigned humility, while their minds are swelled with
   pride, and in words to acknowledge themselves inferior to every one
   else, while they wish to be regarded with the highest esteem, and think
   themselves entitled to the highest honor. Paul is perfectly sincere in
   admitting his unworthiness; nay, at other times he speaks of himself in
   far more degrading language.

   "For I am the least of the apostles, and am not worthy to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
   (1 Corinthians 15:9.)

   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief"
   (1 Timothy 1:15.)

   But let us observe, that, when he speaks of himself as the meanest of
   all, he confines his attention to what he was in himself, apart from
   the grace of God. As if he had said, that his own worthlessness did not
   prevent him from being appointed, while others were passed by, to be
   the apostle of the Gentiles. The grace of God given to me is the
   expression used by him, to intimate that it was a peculiar gift, as
   compared with what had been bestowed on others. Not that he alone had
   been elected to discharge that office, but that he held the highest
   rank among "the teachers of the Gentiles," -- a title which he employs
   on another occasion as peculiar to himself.

   "I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in
   Christ, and lie not,) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
   (1 Timothy 2:7.)

   By the unsearchable riches of Christ are meant the astonishing and
   boundless treasures of grace, which God had suddenly and unexpectedly
   bestowed on the Gentiles. The Ephesians are thus reminded how eagerly
   the gospel ought to be embraced, and how highly it ought to be
   esteemed. This subject has been treated in the Exposition of the
   Epistle to the Galatians, (Galatians 1:15, 16; 2:7, 9.) And certainly,
   while Paul held the office of apostleship in common with others, it was
   an honor peculiar to himself to be appointed apostle of the Gentiles.

   9. What is the fellowship of the mystery. The publication of the gospel
   is called a fellowship, because it is the will of God that his purpose,
   which had formerly been hidden, shall now be shared by men. There is an
   appropriate metaphor in the words photisai pantas, to enlighten all
   men, -- conveying the thought, that, in his apostleship, the grace of
   God shines with the brightness of noon-day.

   Which hath been hid in God. This is intended, as before, to obviate the
   prejudice of novelty, -- to oppose the rashness of men, who think it
   improper that they should remain in ignorance of anything whatever. Who
   will question the right which God has to keep his own purposes
   concealed, until he shall be pleased to communicate them to men? What
   presumption, -- yea, what madness is it, not to admit that God is wiser
   than we! Let us remember, therefore, that our rashness ought to receive
   a check, whenever the boundless height of the Divine foreknowledge is
   presented to our view. This, too, is the reason why he calls them the
   unsearchable riches of Christ; intimating that this subject, though it
   exceeds our capacity, ought to be contemplated with reverence and
   admiration.

   Who created all things by Jesus Christ. This cannot so properly be
   understood of the first creation as of the spiritual renewal. It is, no
   doubt, true, and is frequently declared in Scripture, that by the Word
   of God all things were created; but the connection of the passage lays
   us under the necessity of understanding by it that renewal which is
   comprehended in the blessing of redemption. But it may, perhaps, be
   thought that the apostle is illustrating this renewal, by an argument
   drawn from the creation. "By Christ, as God, the Father created (John
   1:3) all things; and why, then, should we wonder, if by Christ, as
   Mediator, all the Gentiles are now brought back to one body?" I have no
   objection to this view. A similar argument is used by him in another
   Epistle.

   "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is the same
   who hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of
   the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
   (2 Corinthians 4:6.)

   From the creation of the world he concludes, that it is the work of God
   to enlighten the darkness; but what was visible in the former case is
   ascribed to the Spirit, when he comes to speak of the kingdom of
   Christ.

   10. That now to the principalities and powers. Some are of opinion that
   these words cannot apply to angels, because such ignorance, as is here
   supposed, could not be found in those who are permitted to behold the
   brightness of God's countenance. They choose rather to refer them to
   devils, but without due reflection; for what could have been regarded
   as extraordinary in the assertion, that, by the preaching of the gospel
   and the calling of the Gentiles, information was, for the first time,
   conveyed to devils? There can be no doubt that the apostle labors to
   place in the strongest light the mercy of God toward the Gentiles, and
   the high value of the gospel. For this purpose he declares, that the
   preaching of the gospel exhibits the manifold grace of God, with which,
   till now, the heavenly angels themselves were unacquainted. The wisdom
   of God, therefore, which was manifested by uniting Jews and Gentiles in
   the fellowship of the gospel, ought to be regarded by men with the
   highest admiration.

   He calls it polupoikilon sophian, manifold wisdom, because men are
   accustomed to try it by a false standard, confining their view to a
   particular department, and thus forming a most inadequate conception of
   the whole. The Jews thought, for example, that the dispensation under
   the law, with which they were acquainted and familiar, was the only
   form in which the wisdom of God could be seen. But, by making the
   gospel to be proclaimed to all men without exception, God has brought
   forth to view another instance and proof of his wisdom. Not that it was
   new wisdom, but that it was so large and manifold, [132] as to
   transcend our limited capacity. Let us rest assured that the knowledge,
   whatever it may be, which we have acquired, is, after all, but a
   slender proportion. And if the calling of the Gentiles draws the
   attention, and excites the reverence, of angels in heaven, how shameful
   that it should be slighted or disdained by men upon earth!

   The inference which some draw from this passage, that angels are
   present in our assemblies, and make progress along with ourselves in
   knowledge, is a groundless speculation. We must always keep in view the
   purposes for which God appointed the ministry of his word. If angels,
   who are permitted to see the face of God, do not walk in faith, neither
   do they need the outward administration of the word. The preaching of
   the gospel, therefore, is of no service but to human beings, among whom
   alone the practice exists. Paul's meaning is this: "The church,
   composed both of Jews and Gentiles, is a mirror, in which angels behold
   the astonishing wisdom of God displayed in a manner unknown to them
   before. They see a work which is new to them, and the reason of which
   was hid in God. In this manner, and not by learning anything from the
   lips of men, do they make progress."

   11. According to the eternal purpose. How carefully does he guard
   against the objection, that the purpose of God has been changed! A
   third time, he repeats that the decree was eternal and unchangeable,
   but must be carried into effect by Christ Jesus our Lord, because in
   him it was made. Thus he declares, that the proper time for publishing
   this decree belongs to the kingdom of Christ. Literally the words run,
   "according to the eternal purpose (hen epoiesoen) which he made." But I
   consider the meaning to be, which he purposed; because the present
   discussion does not relate solely to the execution of the decree, but
   to the appointment itself, which, though it took place before all ages,
   was known to God only -- till the manifestation of Christ.

   12. Through whom we have boldness. The honor of reconciling the Father
   to the whole world must be given to Christ. From the effects of this
   grace its excellence is demonstrated; for faith, which is possessed by
   Gentiles in common with Jews, admits them into the presence of God.
   When the words, through Christ and by the faith of him, are used by
   Paul, in connection with the name of God, there is always an implied
   contrast, which shuts up every other approach, -- which excludes every
   other method of obtaining Divine fellowship. Most important and
   valuable instruction is here conveyed. The true nature and power of
   faith, and the confidence which is necessary for calling upon God, are
   beautifully expressed. That the consequences of faith, and the duties
   which it performs, should be the subject of much controversy between us
   and the Papists, is not surprising. They do not properly understand the
   meaning of the word Faith, which they might learn from this passage, if
   they were not blinded by prejudice.

   First, Paul denominates it the faith of Christ; by which he intimates,
   that everything which faith ought to contemplate is exhibited to us in
   Christ. Hence it follows, that an empty and confused knowledge of
   Christ must not be mistaken for Faith, but that knowledge which is
   directed to Christ, in order to seek God in Christ; and this can only
   be done when the power and offices of Christ are understood. Faith
   produces confidence, which again, in its turn, produces boldness. There
   are three stages in our progress. First, we believe the promises of
   God; next, by relying on them, we obtain that confidence, which is
   accompanied by holiness and peace of mind; and, last of all, comes
   boldness, which enables us to banish fear, and to come with firmness
   and steadiness into the presence of God.

   To separate faith from confidence would be an attempt to take away heat
   and light from the sun. I acknowledge, indeed, that, in proportion to
   the measure of faith, confidence is small in some and greater in
   others; but faith will never be found unaccompanied by these effects or
   fruits. A trembling, hesitating, doubting conscience, will always be a
   sure evidence of unbelief; but a firm, steady faith, will prove to be
   invincible against the gates of hell. To trust in Christ as Mediator,
   and to entertain a firm conviction of our heavenly Father's love, -- to
   venture boldly to promise to ourselves eternal life, and not to tremble
   at death or hell, -- is, to use a common phrase, a holy presumption.

   Observe the expression, access with confidence. Wicked men seek rest in
   forgetfulness of God, and are never at ease but when they remove to the
   greatest possible distance from God. His own children differ from them
   in this respect, that they "have peace with God," (Romans 5:1,) and
   approach to him with cheerfulness and delight. We infer, likewise, from
   this passage, that, in order to call on God in a proper manner,
   confidence is necessary, and thus becomes the key that opens to us the
   gate of heaven. Those who doubt and hesitate will never be heard.

   "Let him ask in faith," says James, "nothing wavering: for he that
   wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For
   let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."
   (James 1:6,7)

   The sophists of the Sorbonne, [133] when they enjoin men to hesitate,
   know not what it is to call upon God.

   13. Wherefore I desire. His reason for alluding formerly to his
   imprisonment is now manifest. It was to prevent them from being
   discouraged when they heard of his persecution. [134] O heroic breast,
   which drew from a prison, and from death itself, comfort to those who
   were not in danger! He says that, he endured tribulations for the
   Ephesians, because they tended to promote the edification of all the
   godly. How powerfully is the faith of the people confirmed, when a
   pastor does not hesitate to seal his doctrine by the surrender of his
   life! And accordingly he adds, which is your glory. Such lustre was
   thrown around his instructions, that all the churches among whom he had
   labored, had good reason to glory, when they beheld their faith
   ratified by the best of all pledges.

   Ephesians 3:14-19

   14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ,

   14. Hujus rei gratia flecto genua ad Patrem Domini nostri Iesu Christi,

   15. Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

   15. Ex quo omnis cognatio in coelis et super terram nominatur,

   16. That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to
   be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

   16. Ut det vobis secundum divitias gloriae suae, potentia roborari per
   Spiritum suum in hominem interiorem,

   17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
   rooted and grounded in love,

   17. Ut inhabitet Christus per fidem in cordibus vestris, ut sitis in
   charitate radicati atque fundati,

   18. May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height;

   18. Quo valeatis comprehendere cum omnibus sanctis, quae sit latitudo,
   et longitudo, et profunditas, et altitudo;

   19. And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
   might be filled with all the fulness of God.

   19. Cognoscere, inquam, dilectionem Christi, quae cognitionem
   exsuperat, ut completi sitis in omnem plenitudinem Dei.


   14. For this cause. His prayers for them are mentioned, not only to
   testify his regard for them, but likewise to excite them to pray in the
   same manner; for the seed of the word is scattered in vain, unless the
   Lord render it fruitful by his blessing. Let pastors learn from Paul's
   example, not only to admonish and exhort their people, but to entreat
   the Lord to bless their labors, that they may not be unfruitful.
   Nothing will be gained by their industry and toil, -- all their study
   and application will be to no purpose, except so far as the Lord
   bestows his blessing. This ought not to be regarded by them as an
   encouragement to sloth. It is their duty, on the contrary, to labor
   earnestly in sowing and watering, provided they, at the same time, ask
   and expect the increase from the Lord.

   We are thus enabled to refute the slanders of the Pelagians and
   Papists, who argue, that, if the grace of the Holy Spirit performs the
   whole work of enlightening our minds, and forming our hearts to
   obedience, all instruction will be superfluous. The only effect of the
   enlightening and renewing influences of the Holy Spirit is, to give to
   instruction its proper weight and efficacy, that we may not be blind to
   the light of heaven, or deaf to the strains of truth. While the Lord
   alone acts upon us, he acts by his own instruments. It is therefore the
   duty of pastors diligently to teach, -- of the people, earnestly to
   receive instruction, -- and of both, not to weary themselves in
   unprofitable exertions, but to look up for Divine aid.

   I bow my knees. The bodily attitude is here put for the religious
   exercise itself. Not that prayer, in all cases, requires the bending of
   the knees, but because this expression of reverence is commonly
   employed, especially where it is not an incidental petition, but a
   continued prayer.

   15. Of whom the whole family. [135] The relative, ex hou, of whom, may
   apply equally to the Father and to the Son. Erasmus restricts it
   entirely to the Father. I do not approve of this; for readers ought to
   have been allowed a liberty of choice; nay, the other interpretation
   appears to be far more probable. The apostle alludes to that
   relationship which the Jews had with each other, through their father
   Abraham, to whom they trace their lineage. He proposes, on the
   contrary, to remove the distinction between Jews and Gentiles; and
   tells them, not only that all men have been brought into one family and
   one race through Christ, but that they are enabled to claim kindred
   even with angels.

   To apply it to God the Father would not be equally defensible, being
   liable to this obvious exception, that God formerly passed by the
   Gentiles, and adopted the Jews as his peculiar people. But when we
   apply it to Christ, the whole of Paul's statement agrees with the
   facts; for all come and blend together, as one family, and, related to
   one God the Father, are mutually brethren. Let us therefore understand
   that, through the mediation of Christ, a relationship has been
   constituted between Jews and Gentiles, because, by reconciling us to
   the Father, he has made us all one. Jews have no longer any reason to
   boast that they are the posterity of Abraham, or that they belong to
   this or that tribe, -- to despise others as profane, and claim the
   exclusive honor of being a holy people. There is but one relationship
   which ought to be reckoned, both in heaven and on earth, both among
   angels and among men -- a union to the body of Christ. Out of him all
   will be found scattered. He alone is the bond by which we are united.

   16. That he would give to you. Paul wishes that the Ephesians should be
   strengthened; and yet he had already bestowed on their piety no mean
   commendation. But believers have never advanced so far as not to need
   farther growth. The highest perfection of the godly in this life is an
   earnest desire to make progress. This strengthening, he tells us, is
   the work of the Spirit; so that it does not proceed from man's own
   ability. The increase, as well as the commencement, of everything good
   in us, comes from the Holy Spirit. That it is the gift of Divine grace,
   is evident from the expression used, that he would give to you This the
   Papists utterly deny. They maintain that the second grace is bestowed
   upon us, according as we have individually deserved it, by making a
   proper use of the first grace. But let us unite with Paul in
   acknowledging that it is the "gift" of the grace of God, not only that
   we have begun to run well, but that we advance; not only that we have
   been born again, but that we grow from day to day.

   According to the riches of his glory. These words are intended to
   express still more strongly the doctrine of Divine grace. They may be
   explained in two ways: either, according to his glorious riches, making
   the genitive, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, supply the place of an
   adjective, -- or, according to his rich and abundant glory. The word
   glory will thus be put for mercy, in accordance with an expression
   which he had formerly used, "to the praise of the glory of his grace."
   (Ephesians 1:6) I prefer the latter view.

   In the inner man. By the inner man, Paul means the soul, and whatever
   relates to the spiritual life of the soul; as the outward man denotes
   the body, with everything that belongs to it, -- health, honors,
   riches, vigor, beauty, and everything of that nature. "Though our
   outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by day;" that is,
   if in worldly matters we decay, our spiritual life becomes more and
   more vigorous. (2 Corinthians 4:16) The prayer of Paul, that the saints
   may be strengthened, does not mean that they may be eminent and
   flourishing in the world, but that, with respect to the kingdom of God,
   their minds may be made strong by Divine power.

   17. That Christ may dwell. He explains what is meant by "the strength
   of the inner man." As

   "it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell,"
   (Colossians 1:19,)

   so he who has Christ dwelling in him can want nothing. It is a mistake
   to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without obtaining Christ;
   and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can receive
   Christ without the Spirit. Both doctrines must be believed. We are
   partakers of the Holy Spirit, in proportion to the intercourse which we
   maintain with Christ; for the Spirit will be found nowhere but in
   Christ, on whom he is said, on that account, to have rested; for he
   himself says, by the prophet Isaiah, "The Spirit of the Lord God is
   upon me." (Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18.) But neither can Christ be separated
   from his Spirit; for then he would be said to be dead, and to have lost
   all his power.

   Justly, therefore, does Paul affirm that the persons who are endowed by
   God with spiritual vigor are those in whom Christ dwells. He points to
   that part in which Christ peculiarly dwells, in your hearts, -- to show
   that it is not enough if the knowledge of Christ dwell on the tongue or
   flutter in the brain.

   May dwell through faith. The method by which so great a benefit is
   obtained is also expressed. What a remarkable commendation is here
   bestowed on faith, that, by means of it, the Son of God becomes our
   own, and "makes his abode with us!" (John 14:23.) By faith we not only
   acknowledge that Christ suffered and rose from the dead on our account,
   but, accepting the offers which he makes of himself, we possess and
   enjoy him as our Savior. This deserves our careful attention. Most
   people consider fellowship with Christ, and believing in Christ, to be
   the same thing; but the fellowship which we have with Christ is the
   consequence of faith. In a word, faith is not a distant view, but a
   warm embrace, of Christ, by which he dwells in us, and we are filled
   with the Divine Spirit.

   That ye may be rooted and grounded in love. Among the fruits of
   Christ's dwelling in us the apostle enumerates love and gratitude for
   the Divine grace and kindness exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it
   follows, that this is true and solid excellence; so that, whenever he
   treats of the perfection of the saints, he views it as consisting of
   these two parts. The firmness and constancy which our love ought to
   possess are pointed out by two metaphors. There are many persons not
   wholly destitute of love; but it is easily removed or shaken, because
   its roots are not deep. Paul desires that it should be rooted [136] and
   grounded, -- thoroughly fixed in our minds, so as to resemble a
   well-founded building or deeply-planted tree. The true meaning is, that
   our roots ought to be so deeply planted, and our foundation so firmly
   laid in love, that nothing will be able to shake us. It is idle to
   infer from these words, that love is the foundation and root of our
   salvation. Paul does not inquire here, as any one may perceive, on what
   our salvation is founded, but with what firmness and constancy we ought
   to continue in the exercise of love.

   18. May be able to comprehend. The second fruit is, that the Ephesians
   should perceive the greatness of Christ's love to men. Such an
   apprehension or knowledge springs from faith. By desiring that they
   should comprehend it with all saints, he shows that it is the most
   excellent blessing which they can obtain in the present life; that it
   is the highest wisdom, to which all the children of God aspire. What
   follows is sufficiently clear in itself, but has hitherto been darkened
   by a variety of interpretations. Augustine is quite delighted with his
   own acuteness, which throws no light on the subject. Endeavouring to
   discover some kind of mysterious allusion to the figure of the cross,
   he makes the breadth to be love, -- the height, hope, -- the length,
   patience, and the depth, humility. This is very ingenious and
   entertaining: but what has it to do with Paul's meaning? Not more,
   certainly, than the opinion of Ambrose, that the allusion is to the
   figure of a sphere. Laying aside the views of others, I shall state
   what will be universally acknowledged to be the simple and true
   meaning.

   19. And to know the love of Christ. By those dimensions Paul means
   nothing else than the love of Christ, of which he speaks afterwards.
   The meaning is, that he who knows it fully and perfectly is in every
   respect a wise man. As if he had said, "In whatever direction men may
   look, they will find nothing in the doctrine of salvation that does not
   bear some relation to this subject." The love of Christ contains within
   itself the whole of wisdom, so that the words may run thus: that ye may
   be able to comprehend the love of Christ, which is the length and
   breadth, and depth, and height, that is, the complete perfection of all
   wisdom. The metaphor is borrowed from mathematicians, taking the parts
   as expressive of the whole. Almost all men are infected with the
   disease of desiring to obtain useless knowledge. It is of great
   importance that we should be told what is necessary for us to know, and
   what the Lord desires us to contemplate, above and below, on the right
   hand and on the left, before and behind. The love of Christ is held out
   to us as the subject which ought to occupy our daily and nightly
   meditations, and in which we ought to be wholly plunged. He who is in
   possession of this alone has enough. Beyond it there is nothing solid,
   nothing useful, -- nothing, in short, that is proper or sound. Though
   you survey the heaven and earth and sea, you will never go beyond this
   without overstepping the lawful boundary of wisdom.

   Which surpasseth knowledge. A similar expression occurs in another
   Epistle:

   "the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall keep your
   hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
   (Philippians 4:7)

   No man can approach to God without being raised above himself and above
   the world. On this ground the sophists refuse to admit that we can know
   with certainty that we enjoy the grace of God; for they measure faith
   by the perception of the bodily senses. But Paul justly contends that
   this wisdom exceeds all knowledge; for, if the faculties of man could
   reach it, the prayer of Paul that God would bestow it must have been
   unnecessary. Let us remember, therefore, that the certainty of faith is
   knowledge, but is acquired by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, not by
   the acuteness of our own intellect. If the reader desire a more full
   discussion of this subject, he may consult the "Institutes of the
   Christian Religion."

   That ye may be filled. Paul now expresses in one word what he meant by
   the various dimensions. He who has Christ has everything necessary for
   being made perfect in God; for this is the meaning of the phrase, the
   fullness of God. Men do certainly imagine that they have entire
   completeness in themselves, but it is only when their pride is swelled
   with empty trifles. It is a foolish and wicked dream, that by the
   fullness of God is meant the full Godhead, as if men were raised to an
   equality with God.

   opposition to Diana of Ephesus, who was the common goddess of the

   those incorporated cities, so that all Asia (as we have it, Acts 19:27)

   over which she presided as the common mother and patroness; and there
   are models and ancient inscriptions remaining to this day, that

   Ephesians 3:20-21

   20. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
   we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

   20. Ei autem, qui potest cumulate super omnia facere, quae petimus aut
   cogitamus, secundum potentiam in nobis agentem,

   21. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
   ages, world without end. Amen.

   21. Sit gloria in Ecclesia per Iesum Christum, in omnes aetates seculi
   seculorum. Amen.


   20. Now to him. He now breaks out into thanksgiving, which serves the
   additional purpose of exhorting the Ephesians to maintain "good hope
   through grace," (2 Thessalonians 2:16,) and to endeavor constantly to
   obtain more and more adequate conceptions of the value of the grace of
   God.

   Who is able. [137] This refers to the future, and agrees with what we
   are taught concerning hope; and indeed we cannot offer to God proper or
   sincere thanksgivings for favors received, unless we are convinced that
   his goodness to us will be without end. When he says that God is able,
   he does not mean power viewed apart, as the phrase is, from the act,
   but power which is exerted, and which we actually feel. Believers ought
   always to connect it with the work, when the promises made to them, and
   their own salvation, form the subject of inquiry. Whatever God can do,
   he unquestionably will do, if he has promised it. This the apostle
   proves both by former instances, and by the efficacy of the Spirit,
   which was at this very time exerted on their own minds.

   According to the power that worketh in us, -- according to what we feel
   within ourselves; for every benefit which God bestows upon us is a
   manifestation of his grace, and love, and power, in consequence of
   which we ought to cherish a stronger confidence for the future.
   Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, is a remarkable
   expression, and bids us entertain no fear lest faith of a proper kind
   should go to excess. Whatever expectations we form of Divine blessings,
   the infinite goodness of God will exceed all our wishes and all our
   thoughts.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ephesians 4:1-6

   1. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,) beseech you, that ye walk
   worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

   1. Obsecro itaque vos, ego vinctus in Domino, ut digne ambuletis
   vocatione, ad quam vocati estis,

   2. With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one
   another in love;

   2. Cum omni humilitate et mansuetudine, cum tolerantia sufferentes vos
   invicem in dilectione,

   3. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

   3. Studentes servare unitatem Spiritus, in vinculo pacis.

   4. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope
   of your calling;

   4. Unum corpus et unus spiritus; quemadmodum vocati estis in una spe
   vocationis vestrae.

   5. One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

   5. Unus Dominus, una fides, unum baptisma.

   6. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in
   you all.

   6. Unus Deus et Pater omnium, qui est super omnia, et per omnia, (vel,
   super omnes et per omnes,) et in omnibus vobis.


   The three remaining chapters consist entirely of practical
   exhortations. Mutual agreement is the first subject, in the course of
   which a discussion is introduced respecting the government of the
   church, as having been framed by our Lord for the purpose of
   maintaining unity among Christians.

   1. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord. His imprisonment, which might
   have been supposed more likely to render him despised, is appealed to,
   as we have already seen, for a confirmation of his authority. It was
   the seal of that embassy with which he had been honored. Whatever
   belongs to Christ, though in the eyes of men it may be attended by
   ignominy, ought to be viewed by us with the highest regard. The
   apostle's prison is more truly venerable than the splendid retinue or
   triumphal chariot of kings.

   That ye may walk worthy. This is a general sentiment, a sort of
   preface, on which all the following statements are founded. He had
   formerly illustrated the calling with which they were called, [138] and
   now reminds them that they must live in obedience to God, in order that
   they may not be unworthy of such distinguished grace.

   2. With all humility. He now descends to particulars, and first of all
   he mentions humility The reason is, that he was about to enter on the
   subject of Unity, to which humility is the first step. This again
   produces meekness, which disposes us to bear with our brethren, and
   thus to preserve that unity which would otherwise be broken a hundred
   times in a day. Let us remember, therefore, that, in cultivating
   brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility. Whence come rudeness,
   pride, and disdainful language towards brethren? Whence come quarrels,
   insults, and reproaches? Come they not from this, that every one
   carries his love of himself, and his regard to his own interests, to
   excess? By laying aside haughtiness and a desire of pleasing ourselves,
   we shall become meek and gentle, and acquire that moderation of temper
   which will overlook and forgive many things in the conduct of our
   brethren. Let us carefully observe the order and arrangement of these
   exhortations. It will be to no purpose that we inculcate forbearance
   till the natural fierceness has been subdued, and mildness acquired;
   and it will be equally vain to discourse of meekness, till we have
   begun with humility.

   Forbearing one another in love. This agrees with what is elsewhere
   taught, that "love suffereth long and is kind." (1 Corinthians 13:4.)
   Where love is strong and prevalent, we shall perform many acts of
   mutual forbearance.

   3. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit. With good reason does
   he recommend forbearance, as tending to promote the unity of the
   Spirit. Innumerable offenses arise daily, which might produce quarrels,
   particularly when we consider the extreme bitterness of man's natural
   temper. Some consider the unity of the Spirit to mean that spiritual
   unity which is produced in us by the Spirit of God. There can be no
   doubt that He alone makes us "of one accord, of one mind," (Philippians
   2:2,) and thus makes us one; but I think it more natural to understand
   the words as denoting harmony of views. This unity, he tells us, is
   maintained by the bond of peace; for disputes frequently give rise to
   hatred and resentment. We must live at peace, if we would wish that
   brotherly kindness should be permanent amongst us.

   4. There is one body. [139] He proceeds to show more fully in how
   complete a manner Christians ought to be united. The union ought to be
   such that we shall form one body and one soul. These words denote the
   whole man. We ought to be united, not in part only, but in body and
   soul. He supports this by a powerful argument, as ye have been called
   in one hope of your calling. We are called to one inheritance and one
   life; and hence it follows, that we cannot obtain eternal life without
   living in mutual harmony in this world. One Divine invitation being
   addressed to all, they ought to be united in the same profession of
   faith, and to render every kind of assistance to each other. Oh, were
   this thought deeply impressed upon our minds, that we are subject to a
   law which no more permits the children of God to differ among
   themselves than the kingdom of heaven to be divided, how earnestly
   should we cultivate brotherly kindness! How should we dread every kind
   of animosity, if we duly reflected that all who separate us from
   brethren, estrange us from the kingdom of God! And yet, strangely
   enough, while we forget the duties which brethren owe to each other, we
   go on boasting that we are the sons of God. Let us learn from Paul,
   that none are at all fit for that inheritance who are not one body and
   one spirit.

   5. One Lord. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, he employs the
   word Lord, to denote simply the government of God.

   "There are differences of administration, but the same Lord."
   (1 Corinthians 12:5)

   In the present instance, as he shortly afterwards makes express mention
   of the Father, he gives this appellation strictly to Christ, who has
   been appointed by the Father to be our Lord, and to whose government we
   cannot be subject, unless we are of one mind. The frequent repetition
   of the word one is emphatic. Christ cannot be divided. Faith cannot be
   rent. There are not various baptisms, but one which is common to all.
   God cannot cease to be one, and unchangeable. It cannot but be our duty
   to cherish holy unity, which is bound by so many ties. Faith, and
   baptism, and God the Father, and Christ, ought to unite us, so as
   almost to become one man. All these arguments for unity deserve to be
   pondered, but cannot be fully explained. I reckon it enough to take a
   rapid glance at the apostle's meaning, leaving the full illustration of
   it to the preachers of the gospel. The unity of faith, which is here
   mentioned, depends on the one, eternal truth of God, on which it is
   founded.

   One baptism, This does not mean that Christian baptism is not to be
   administered more than once, but that one baptism is common to all; so
   that, by means of it, we begin to form one body and one soul. But if
   that argument has any force, a much stronger one will be founded on the
   truth, that the Father, and Son, and Spirit, are one God; for it is one
   baptism, which is celebrated in the name of the Three Persons. What
   reply will the Arians or Sabellians make to this argument? Baptism
   possesses such force as to make us one; and in baptism, the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, is invoked. Will they deny
   that one Godhead is the foundation of this holy and mysterious unity?
   We are compelled to acknowledge, that the ordinance of baptism proves
   the existence of Three Persons in one Divine essence.

   6. One God and Father of all. This is the main argument, from which all
   the rest flow. How comes it that we are united by faith, by baptism, or
   even by the government of Christ, but because God the Father, extending
   to each of us his gracious presence, employs these means for gathering
   us to himself? The two phrases, epi panton kai dia panton, may either
   mean, above all and through all Things, or above all and through all
   Men. Either meaning will apply sufficiently well, or rather, in both
   cases, the meaning will be the same. Although God by his power upholds,
   and maintains, and rules, all things, yet Paul is not now speaking of
   the universal, but of the spiritual government which belongs to the
   church. By the Spirit of sanctification, God spreads himself through
   all the members of the church, embraces all in his government, and
   dwells in all; but God is not inconsistent with himself, and therefore
   we cannot but be united to him into one body.

   This spiritual unity is mentioned by our Lord.

   "Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast, given
   me, that they may be one as we are."
   (John 17:11)

   This is true indeed, in a general sense, not only of all men but of all
   creatures. "In him we live, and move, and have our being." (Acts
   17:28.) And again, "Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?"
   (Jeremiah 23:24.) But we must attend to the connection in which this
   passage stands. Paul is now illustrating the mutual relation of
   believers, which has nothing in common either with wicked men or with
   inferior animals. To this relation we must limit what is said about
   God's government and presence. It is for this reason, also, that the
   apostle uses the word Father, which applies only to the members of
   Christ.

   Ephesians 4:7-10

   7. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
   the gift of Christ.

   7. Unicuique autem nostrum data est gratia; secundum mensuram
   donationis Christi.

   8. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
   captive, and gave gifts unto men.

   8. Propterea dicit: Postquam ascendit in altum, captivam duxit
   captivitatem, et dedit dona hominibus. (Psalm 68:19.)

   9. (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
   into the lower parts of the earth?

   9. Illud autem Ascendit, quid est, nisi quod etiam descenderat prius in
   inferiores partes terrae?

   10. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
   heavens, that he might fill all things.)

   10. Qui descendit, ipse est etiam qui ascendit super omnes coelos, ut
   impleret omnia.


   7. But to every one. He now describes the manner in which God
   establishes and preserves among us a mutual relation. No member of the
   body of Christ is endowed with such perfection as to be able, without
   the assistance of others, to supply his own necessities. A certain
   proportion is allotted to each; and it is only by communicating with
   each other, that all enjoy what is sufficient for maintaining their
   respective places in the body. The diversity of gifts is discussed in
   another Epistle, and very nearly with the same object.

   "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit"
   (1 Corinthians 12:4.)

   Such a diversity, we are there taught, is so far from injuring, that it
   tends to promote and strengthen, the harmony of believers.

   The meaning of this verse may be thus summed up. "On no one has God
   bestowed all things. Each has received a certain measure. Being thus
   dependent on each other, they find it necessary to throw their
   individual gifts into the common stock, and thus to render mutual aid."
   The words grace and gift remind us that, whatever may be our
   attainments, we ought not to be proud of them, because they lay us
   under deeper obligations to God. These blessings are said to be the
   gift of Christ; for, as the apostle, first of all, mentioned the
   Father, so his aim, as we shall see, is to represent all that we are,
   and all that we have, as gathered together in Christ.

   8. Therefore he saith. To serve the purpose of his argument, Paul has
   departed not a little from the true meaning of this quotation. Wicked
   men charge him with having made an unfair use of Scripture. The Jews go
   still farther, and, for the sake of giving to their accusations a
   greater air of plausibility, maliciously pervert the natural meaning of
   this passage. What is said of God, is applied by them to David or to
   the people. "David, or the people," they say, "ascended on high, when,
   in consequence of many victories, they rose superior to their enemies."
   But a careful examination of the Psalm will convince any reader that
   the words, he ascended up on high, are applied strictly to God alone.

   The whole Psalm may be regarded as an epinikion, a song of triumph,
   which David sings to God on account of the victories which he had
   obtained; but, taking occasion from the narrative of his own exploits,
   he makes a passing survey of the astonishing deliverances which the
   Lord had formerly wrought for his people. His object is to shew, that
   we ought to contemplate in the history of the Church the glorious power
   and goodness of God; and among other things he says, Thou hast ascended
   on high. (Psalm 68:18.) The flesh is apt to imagine that God remains
   idle and asleep, when he does not openly execute his judgments. To the
   view of men, when the Church is oppressed, God is in some manner
   humbled; but, when he stretches out his avenging arm for her
   deliverance, he then appears to rouse himself, and to ascend his throne
   of judgment.

   "Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that
   shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies in the hinder
   parts; he put them to a perpetual reproach."
   (Psalm 78:65, 66.)

   This mode of expression is sufficiently common and familiar; and, in
   short, the deliverance of the Church is here called the ascension of
   God.

   Perceiving that it is a song of triumph, in which David celebrates all
   the victories which God had wrought for the salvation of his Church,
   Paul very properly quoted the account given of God's ascension, and
   applied it to the person of Christ. The noblest triumph which God ever
   gained was when Christ, after subduing sin, conquering death, and
   putting Satan to flight, rose majestically to heaven, that he might
   exercise his glorious reign over the Church. Hitherto there is no
   ground for the objection, that Paul has applied this quotation in a
   manner inconsistent with the design of the Psalmist. The continued
   existence of the Church is represented by David to be a manifestation
   of the Divine glory. But no ascension of God more triumphant or
   memorable will ever occur, than that which took place when Christ was
   carried up to the right hand of the Father, that he might rule over all
   authorities and powers, and might become the everlasting guardian and
   protector of his people.

   He led captivity captive. Captivity is a collective noun for captive
   enemies; and the plain meaning is, that God reduced his enemies to
   subjection, which was more fully accomplished in Christ than in any
   other way. He has not only gained a complete victory over the devil,
   and sin, and death, and all the power of hell, -- but out of rebels he
   forms every day "a willing people," (Psalm 110:3,) when he subdues by
   his word the obstinacy of our flesh. On the other hand, his enemies --
   to which class all wicked men belong -- are held bound by chains of
   iron, and are restrained by his power from exerting their fury beyond
   the limits which he shall assign.

   And gave gifts to men. There is rather more difficulty in this clause;
   for the words of the Psalm are, "thou hast received gifts for men,"
   while the apostle changes this expression into gave gifts, and thus
   appears to exhibit an opposite meaning. Still there is no absurdity
   here; for Paul does not always quote the exact words of Scripture, but,
   after referring to the passage, satisfies himself with conveying the
   substance of it in his own language. Now, it is clear that the gifts
   which David mentions were not received by God for himself, but for his
   people; and accordingly we are told, in an earlier part of the Psalm,
   that "the spoil" had been "divided" among the families of Israel.
   (Psalm 68:12.) Since therefore the intention of receiving was to give
   gifts, Paul can hardly be said to have departed from the substance,
   whatever alteration there may be in the words.

   At the same time, I am inclined to a different opinion, that Paul
   purposely changed the word, and employed it, not as taken out of the
   Psalm, but as an expression of his own, adapted to the present
   occasion. Having quoted from the Psalm a few words descriptive of
   Christ's ascension, he adds, in his own language, and gave gifts, --
   for the purpose of drawing a comparison between the greater and the
   less. Paul intends to shew, that this ascension of God in the person of
   Christ was far more illustrious than the ancient triumphs of the
   Church; because it is a more honorable distinction for a conqueror to
   dispense his bounty largely to all classes, than to gather spoils from
   the vanquished.

   The interpretation given by some, that Christ received from the Father
   what he would distribute to us, is forced, and utterly at variance with
   the apostle's purpose. No solution of the difficulty, in my opinion, is
   more natural than this. Having made a brief quotation from the Psalm,
   Paul took the liberty of adding a statement, which, though not
   contained in the Psalm, is true in reference to Christ -- a statement,
   too, by which the ascension of Christ is proved to be more illustrious,
   and more worthy of admiration, than those ancient manifestations of the
   Divine glory which David enumerates.

   9. Now that he ascended. Here again the slanderers exclaim, that Paul's
   reasoning is trifling and childish. "Why does he attempt to make those
   words apply to a real ascension of Christ, which were figuratively
   spoken about a manifestation of the Divine glory? Who does not know
   that the word ascend is metaphorical? The conclusion, that he also
   descended first, has therefore no weight."

   I answer, Paul does not here reason in the manner of a logician, as to
   what necessarily follows, or may be inferred, from the words of the
   prophet. He knew that what David spake about God's ascension was
   metaphorical. But neither can it be denied, that the expression bears a
   reference to some kind of humiliation on the part of God which had
   previously existed. It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers
   from the declaration that God had ascended. And at what time did God
   descend lower than when Christ emptied himself? ( 'All ' heauton
   ekenose, Philippians 2:7.) If ever there was a time when, after
   appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power, God ascended
   gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on
   earth, and received into heavenly glory.

   Besides, it is not necessary to inquire very carefully into the literal
   exposition of the Psalm, since Paul merely alludes to the prophet's
   words, in the same manner as, on another occasion, he accommodates to
   his own subject a passage taken from the writings of Moses. "The
   righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this manner, Say not in
   thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ
   down from above;) or, who shall descend into the deep (that is, to
   bring up Christ again from the dead.") (Romans 10:6,7 Deuteronomy
   30:12.) But the appropriateness of the application which Paul makes of
   the passage to the person of Christ is not the only ground on which it
   must be defended. Sufficient evidence is afforded by the Psalm itself,
   that this ascription of praise relates to Christ's kingdom. Not to
   mention other reasons which might be urged, it contains a distinct
   prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles.

   Into the lower parts of the earth. [140] These words mean nothing more
   than the condition of the present life. To torture them so as to make
   them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish. The argument taken
   from the comparative degree, "the lower parts," is quite untenable. A
   comparison is drawn, not between one part of the earth and another, but
   between the whole earth and heaven; as if he had said, that from that
   lofty habitation Christ descended into our deep gulf.

   10. That ascended up far above all heavens; that is, beyond this
   created world. When Christ is said to be in heaven, we must not view
   him as dwelling among the spheres and numbering the stars. Heaven
   denotes a place higher than all the spheres, which was assigned to the
   Son of God after his resurrection. [141] Not that it is literally a
   place beyond the world, but we cannot speak of the kingdom of God
   without using our ordinary language. Others, again, considering that
   the expressions, above all heavens, and ascension into heaven, are of
   the same import, conclude that Christ is not separated from us by
   distance of place. But one point they have overlooked. When Christ is
   placed above the heavens, or in the heavens, all that surrounds the
   earth -- all that lies beneath the sun and stars, beneath the whole
   frame of the visible world -- is excluded.

   That he might fill all things. To fill often signifies to Finish, and
   it might have that meaning here; for, by his ascension into heaven,
   Christ entered into the possession of the authority given to him by the
   Father, that he might rule and govern all things. But a more beautiful
   view, in my opinion, will be obtained by connecting two meanings which,
   though apparently contradictory, are perfectly consistent. When we hear
   of the ascension of Christ, it instantly strikes our minds that he is
   removed to a great distance from us; and so he actually is, with
   respect to his body and human presence. But Paul reminds us, that,
   while he is removed from us in bodily presence, he fills all things by
   the power of his Spirit. Wherever the right hand of God, which embraces
   heaven and earth, is displayed, Christ is spiritually present by his
   boundless power; although, as respects his body, the saying of Peter
   holds true, that

   "the heaven must receive him until the times of restitution of all
   things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets
   since the world began." (Acts 3:21.)

   By alluding to the seeming contradiction, the apostle has added not a
   little beauty to his language. He ascended; but it was that he, who was
   formerly bounded by a little space, might fill all things But did he
   not fill them before? In his divine nature, I own, he did; but the
   power of his Spirit was not so exerted, nor his presence so manifested,
   as after he had entered into the possession of his kingdom.

   "The Holy Ghost was not yet given,
   because Jesus was not yet glorified." (John 7:39.)

   And again,

   "It is expedient for you that I go away; for, if I go not away, the
   Comforter will not come to you." (John 16:7.)

   In a word, when he began to sit at the right hand of the Father, he
   began also to fill all things. [142]

   [140] For the lower parts of the earth,' they may possibly signify no
   more than the place beneath; as when our Savior said, (John 8:23,) Ye
   are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of
   this world;' or as God spake by the prophet, I will shew wonders in
   heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath.' Nay, they may well refer
   to his incarnation, according to that of David, (Psalm 139:15,) or to
   his burial. (Psalm 63:9.)" -- Pearson.

   [141] "This was the place of which our Savior spake to his disciples,
   What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?'
   Had he been there before in body, it had been no such wonder that he
   should have ascended thither again; but that his body should ascend
   unto that place where the majesty of God was most resplendent; that the
   flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, should be seated far above
   all angels and archangels, all principalities and powers, even at the
   right hand of God; this was that which Christ propounded as worthy of
   their greatest admiration. Whatsoever heaven there is higher than all
   the rest that are called heavens; whatsoever sanctuary is holier than
   all which are called holies; whatsoever place is of greatest dignity in
   all those courts above, into that place did he ascend, where, in the
   splendor of his Deity, he was before he took upon him our humanity." --
   Pearson.

   [142] "The deepest humiliation is followed by the highest exaltation.
   From the highest heaven, than which nothing can be higher, Christ
   descended to hell, than which nothing can be lower. And on that account
   he deserved that he should be again carried up beyond the boundaries of
   all the heavens, withdrawing from us the presence of his body in such a
   manner, that from on high he might fill all things with heavenly gifts,
   and, in a different manner, might now be present with us more
   effectually than he was present while he dwelt with us on earth." --
   Erasmus.

   Ephesians 4:11-14

   11. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
   evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

   11. Et ipse dedit alios quidem apostolos, alios autem prophetas, alios
   vero evangelistas, alios pastores et doctores,

   12. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
   the edifying of the body of Christ:

   12. Ad instaurationem sanctorum, in opus ministerii, in aedificationem
   corporis Christi,

   13. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
   the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
   the fullness of Christ:

   13. Usquedum occurramus omnes in unitatem fidei, et cognitionis Filii
   Dei, in virum perfectum, in mensuram aetatis plenitudinis Christi;

   14. That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
   cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

   14. Ne amplius simus pueri, qui fluctuemur, et circumferamur quovis
   vento doctrinae, per aestum hominum, per versutiam ad circumventionem
   imposturae.


   He returns to explain the distribution of gifts, and illustrates at
   greater length what he had slightly hinted, that out of this variety
   arises unity in the church, as the various tones in music produce sweet
   melody. The meaning may be thus summed up. "The external ministry of
   the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it
   yields. Certain men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching
   the gospel. This is the arrangement by which the Lord is pleased to
   govern his church, to maintain its existence, and ultimately to secure
   its highest perfection."

   It may excite surprise, that, when the gifts of the Holy Spirit form
   the subject of discussion, Paul should enumerate offices instead of
   gifts. I reply, when men are called by God, gifts are necessarily
   connected with offices. God does not confer on men the mere name of
   Apostles or Pastors, but also endows them with gifts, without which
   they cannot properly discharge their office. He whom God has appointed
   to be an apostle does not bear an empty and useless title; for the
   divine command, and the ability to perform it, go together. Let us now
   examine the words in detail.

   11. And he gave. The government of the church, by the preaching of the
   word, is first of all declared to be no human contrivance, but a most
   sacred ordinance of Christ. The apostles did not appoint themselves,
   but were chosen by Christ; and, at the present day, true pastors do not
   rashly thrust themselves forward by their own judgment, but are raised
   up by the Lord. In short, the government of the church, by the ministry
   of the word, is not a contrivance of men, but an appointment made by
   the Son of God. As his own unalterable law, it demands our assent. They
   who reject or despise this ministry offer insult and rebellion to
   Christ its Author. It is himself who gave them; for, if he does not
   raise them up, there will be none. Another inference is, that no man
   will be fit or qualified for so distinguished an office who has not
   been formed and moulded by the hand of Christ himself. To Christ we owe
   it that we have ministers of the gospel, that they abound in necessary
   qualifications, that they execute the trust committed to them. All, all
   is his gift.

   Some, apostles. The different names and offices assigned to different
   persons take their rise from that diversity of the members which goes
   to form the completeness of the whole body, -- every ground of
   emulation, and envy, and ambition, being thus removed. If every person
   shall display a selfish character, shall strive to outshine his
   neighbor, and shall disregard all concerns but his own, -- or, if more
   eminent persons shall be the object of envy to those who occupy a lower
   place, -- in each, and in all of these cases, gifts are not applied to
   their proper use. He therefore reminds them, that the gifts bestowed on
   individuals are intended, not to be held for their personal and
   separate interests, but to be employed for the benefit of the whole. Of
   the offices which are here enumerated, we have already spoken at
   considerable length, [143] and shall now say nothing more than the
   exposition of the passage seems to demand. Five classes of
   office-bearers are mentioned, though on this point, I am aware, there
   is a diversity of opinion; for some consider the two last to make but
   one office. Leaving out of view the opinions of others, I shall proceed
   to state my own.

   I take the word apostles not in that general sense which the derivation
   of the term might warrant, but in its own peculiar signification, for
   those highly favored persons whom Christ exalted to the highest honor.
   Such were the twelve, to whose number Paul was afterwards added. Their
   office was to spread the doctrine of the gospel throughout the whole
   world, to plant churches, and to erect the kingdom of Christ. They had
   not churches of their own committed to them; but the injunction given
   to all of them was, to preach the gospel wherever they went.

   Next to them come the Evangelists, who were closely allied in the
   nature of their office, but held an inferior rank. To this class
   belonged Timothy and others; for, while Paul mentions them along with
   himself in the salutations of his epistles, he does not speak of them
   as his companions in the apostleship, but claims this name as
   peculiarly his own. The services in which the Lord employed them were
   auxiliary to those of the apostles, to whom they were next in rank.

   To these two classes the apostle adds Prophets. By this name some
   understand those persons who possessed the gift of predicting future
   events, among whom was Agabus. (Acts 11:28; 21:10.) But, for my own
   part, as doctrine is the present subject, I would rather define the
   word prophets, as on a former occasion, [144] to mean distinguished
   interpreters of prophecies, who, by a remarkable gift of revelation,
   applied them to the subjects which they had occasion to handle; not
   excluding, however, the gift of prophecy, by which their doctrinal
   instruction was usually accompanied.

   Pastors and Teachers are supposed by some to denote one office, because
   the apostle does not, as in the other parts of the verse, say, and
   some, pastors; and some, teachers; but, tous de, poimenas kai
   didaskalous, and some, pastors and teachers Chrysostom and Augustine
   are of this opinion; not to mention the commentaries of Ambrose, whose
   observations on the subject are truly childish and unworthy of himself.
   I partly agree with them, that Paul speaks indiscriminately of pastors
   and teachers as belonging to one and the same class, and that the name
   teacher does, to some extent, apply to all pastors. But this does not
   appear to me a sufficient reason why two offices, which I find to
   differ from each other, should be confounded. Teaching is, no doubt,
   the duty of all pastors; but to maintain sound doctrine requires a
   talent for interpreting Scripture, and a man may be a teacher who is
   not qualified to preach.

   Pastors, in my opinion, are those who have the charge of a particular
   flock; though I have no objection to their receiving the name of
   teachers, if it be understood that there is a distinct class of
   teachers, who preside both in the education of pastors and in the
   instruction of the whole church. It may sometimes happen, that the same
   person is both a pastor and a teacher, but the duties to be performed
   are entirely different.

   It deserves attention, also, that, of the five offices which are here
   enumerated, not more than the last two are intended to be perpetual.
   Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets were bestowed on the church for a
   limited time only, -- except in those cases where religion has fallen
   into decay, and evangelists are raised up in an extraordinary manner,
   to restore the pure doctrine which had been lost. But without Pastors
   and Teachers there can be no government of the church.

   Papists have some reason to complain, that their primacy, of which they
   boast so much, is openly insulted in this passage. The subject of
   discussion is the unity of the church. Paul inquires into the means by
   which its continuance is secured, and the outward expressions by which
   it is promoted, and comes at length to the government of the church. If
   he knew a primacy which had a fixed residence, was it not his duty, for
   the benefit of the whole church, to exhibit one ministerial head placed
   over all the members, under whose government we are collected into one
   body? We must either charge Paul with inexcusable neglect and
   foolishness, in leaving out the most appropriate and powerful argument,
   or we must acknowledge that this primacy is at variance with the
   appointment of Christ. In truth, he plainly rejects it as without
   foundation, when he ascribes superiority to Christ alone, and
   represents the apostles, and all the pastors, as indeed inferior to
   Him, but associated on an equal level with each other. There is no
   passage of Scripture by which that tyrannical hierarchy, regulated by
   one earthly head, is more completely overturned. Paul has been followed
   by Cyprian, who gives a short and clear definition of what forms the
   only lawful monarchy in the church. There is, he says, one bishoprick,
   which unites the various parts into one whole. This bishoprick he
   claims for Christ alone, leaving the administration of it to
   individuals, but in a united capacity, no one being permitted to exalt
   himself above others.

   12. For the renewing of the saints. In this version I follow Erasmus,
   not because I prefer his view, but to allow the reader an opportunity
   of comparing his version with the Vulgate and with mine, and then
   choosing for himself. The old translation was, (ad consummationem,) for
   the completeness. The Greek word employed by Paul is katartismos, which
   signifies literally the adaptation of things possessing symmetry and
   proportion; just as, in the human body, the members are united in a
   proper and regular manner; so that the word comes to signify
   perfection. But as Paul intended to express here a just and orderly
   arrangement, I prefer the word (constitutio) settlement or
   constitution, taking it in that sense in which a commonwealth, or
   kingdom, or province, is said to be settled, when confusion gives place
   to the regular administration of law.

   For the work of the ministry. God might himself have performed this
   work, if he had chosen; but he has committed it to the ministry of men.
   This is intended to anticipate an objection. "Cannot the church be
   constituted and properly arranged, without the instrumentality of men?"
   Paul asserts that a ministry is required, because such is the will of
   God.

   For the edifying of the body of Christ. This is the same thing with
   what he had formerly denominated the settlement or perfecting of the
   saints. Our true completeness and perfection consist in our being
   united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly commendatory
   of the ministry of the word could have been employed, than to ascribe
   to it this effect. What is more excellent than to produce the true and
   complete perfection of the church? And yet this work, so admirable and
   divine, is here declared by the apostle to be accomplished by the
   external ministry of the word. That those who neglect this instrument
   should hope to become perfect in Christ is utter madness. Yet such are
   the fanatics, on the one hand, who pretend to be favored with secret
   revelations of the Spirit, -- and proud men, on the other, who imagine
   that to them the private reading of the Scriptures is enough, and that
   they have no need of the ordinary ministry of the church.

   If the edification of the church proceeds from Christ alone, he has
   surely a right to prescribe in what manner it shall be edified. But
   Paul expressly states, that, according to the command of Christ, no
   real union or perfection is attained, but by the outward preaching. We
   must allow ourselves to be ruled and taught by men. This is the
   universal rule, which extends equally to the highest and to the lowest.
   The church is the common mother of all the godly, which bears,
   nourishes, and brings up children to God, kings and peasants alike; and
   this is done by the ministry. Those who neglect or despise this order
   choose to be wiser than Christ. Woe to the pride of such men! It is, no
   doubt, a thing in itself possible that divine influence alone should
   make us perfect without human assistance. But the present inquiry is
   not what the power of God can accomplish, but what is the will of God
   and the appointment of Christ. In employing human instruments for
   accomplishing their salvation, God has conferred on men no ordinary
   favor. Nor can any exercise be found better adapted to promote unity
   than to gather around the common doctrine -- the standard of our
   General.

   13. Till we all come. Paul had already said, that by the ministry of
   men the church is regulated and governed, so as to attain the highest
   perfection. But his commendation of the ministry is now carried
   farther. The necessity for which he had pleaded is not confined to a
   single day, but continues to the end. Or, to speak more plainly, he
   reminds his readers that the use of the ministry is not temporal, like
   that of a school for children, (paidagogia, Galatians 3:24,) but
   constant, so long as we remain in the world. Enthusiasts dream that the
   use of the ministry ceases as soon as we have been led to Christ. Proud
   men, who carry their desire of knowledge beyond what is proper, look
   down with contempt on the elementary instruction of childhood. But Paul
   maintains that we must persevere in this course till all our
   deficiencies are supplied; that we must make progress till death, under
   the teaching of Christ alone; and that we must not be ashamed to be the
   scholars of the church, to which Christ has committed our education.

   In the unity of the faith. But ought not the unity of the faith to
   reign among us from the very commencement? It does reign, I
   acknowledge, among the sons of God, but not so perfectly as to make
   them come together. Such is the weakness of our nature, that it is
   enough if every day brings some nearer to others, and all nearer to
   Christ. The expression, coming together, denotes that closest union to
   which we still aspire, and which we shall never reach, until this
   garment of the flesh, which is always accompanied by some remains of
   ignorance and weakness, shall have been laid aside.

   And of the knowledge of the Son of God. This clause appears to be added
   for the sake of explanation. It was the apostle's intention to explain
   what is the nature of true faith, and in what it consists; that is,
   when the Son of God is known. To the Son of God alone faith ought to
   look; on him it relies; in him it rests and terminates. If it proceed
   farther, it will disappear, and will no longer be faith, but a
   delusion. Let us remember, that true faith confines its view so
   entirely to Christ, that it neither knows, nor desires to know,
   anything else.

   Into a perfect man. This must be read in immediate connection with what
   goes before; as if he had said, "What is the highest perfection of
   Christians? How is that perfection attained?" Full manhood is found in
   Christ; for foolish men do not, in a proper manner, seek their
   perfection in Christ. It ought to be held as a fixed principle among
   us, that all that is out of Christ is hurtful and destructive. Whoever
   is a man in Christ, is, in every respect, a perfect man.

   The AGE of fullness means -- full or mature age. No mention is made of
   old age, for in the Christian progress no place for it is found.
   Whatever becomes old has a tendency to decay; but the vigor of this
   spiritual life is continually advancing.

   14. That we may be no more children. Having spoken of that perfect
   manhood, towards which we are proceeding throughout the whole course of
   our life, he reminds us that, during such a progress, we ought not to
   resemble children. An intervening period is thus pointed out between
   childhood and man's estate. Those are "children" who have not yet
   advanced a step in the way of the Lord, but who still hesitate, -- who
   have not yet determined what road they ought to choose, but move
   sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, always doubtful,
   always wavering. Those, again, who are thoroughly founded in the
   doctrine of Christ, though not yet perfect, have so much wisdom and
   vigor as to choose properly, and proceed steadily, in the right course.
   Thus we find that the life of believers, marked by a constant desire
   and progress towards those attainments which they shall ultimately
   reach, bears a resemblance to youth. At no period of this life are we
   men. But let not such a statement be carried to the other extreme, as
   if there were no progress beyond childhood. After being born to Christ,
   we ought to grow, so as "not to be children in understanding." (1
   Corinthians 14:20.) Hence it appears what kind of Christianity the
   Popish system must be, when the pastors labor, to the utmost of their
   power, to keep the people in absolute infancy.

   Tossed to and fro, and carried about. The distressing hesitation of
   those who do not place absolute reliance on the word of the Lord, is
   illustrated by two striking metaphors. The first is taken from small
   ships, exposed to the fury of the billows in the open sea, holding no
   fixed course, guided neither by skill nor design, but hurried along by
   the violence of the tempest. The next is taken from straws, or other
   light substances, which are carried hither and thither as the wind
   drives them, and often in opposite directions. Such must be the
   changeable and unsteady character of all who do not rest on the
   foundation of God's eternal truth. It is their just punishment for
   looking, not to God, but to men. Paul declares, on the other hand, that
   faith, which rests on the word of God, stands unshaken against all the
   attacks of Satan.

   By every wind of doctrine. By a beautiful metaphor, all the doctrines
   of men, by which we are drawn away from the simplicity of the gospel,
   are called winds God gave us his word, by which we might have placed
   ourselves beyond the possibility of being moved; but, giving way to the
   contrivances of men, we are carried about in all directions.

   By the cunning of men. There will always be impostors, who make
   insidious attacks upon our faith; but, if we are fortified by the truth
   of God, their efforts will be unavailing. Both parts of this statement
   deserve our careful attention. When new sects, or wicked tenets, spring
   up, many persons become alarmed. But the attempts of Satan to darken,
   by his falsehoods, the pure doctrine of Christ, are at no time
   interrupted; and it is the will of God that these struggles should be
   the trial of our faith. When we are informed, on the other hand, that
   the best and readiest defense against every kind of error is to bring
   forward that doctrine which we have learned from Christ and his
   apostles, this surely is no ordinary consolation.

   With what awful wickedness, then, are Papists chargeable, who take away
   from the word of God everything like certainty, and maintain that there
   is no steadiness of faith, but what depends on the authority of men! If
   a man entertain any doubt, it is in vain to bid him consult the word of
   God: he must abide by their decrees. But we have embraced the law, the
   prophets, and the gospel. Let us therefore confidently expect that we
   shall reap the advantage which is here promised, -- that all the
   impostures of men will do us no harm. They will attack us, indeed, but
   they will not prevail. We are entitled, I acknowledge, to look for the
   dispensation of sound doctrine from the church, for God has committed
   it to her charge; but when Papists avail themselves of the disguise of
   the church for burying doctrine, they give sufficient proof that they
   have a diabolical synagogue.

   The Greek word kubeia, which I have translated cunning, is taken from
   players at dice, who are accustomed to practice many arts of deception.
   The words, en panourgia, by craftiness, intimate that the ministers of
   Satan are deeply skilled in imposture; and it is added, that they keep
   watch, in order to insnare, (pros ten methodeian tos planes.) All this
   should rouse and sharpen our minds to profit by the word of God. If we
   neglect to do so, we may fall into the snares of our enemies, and
   endure the severe punishment of our sloth.

   Ephesians 4:15-16

   15. But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
   things, which is the head, even Christ:

   15. Veritatem autem sectantes in charitate, crescamus in eum per omnia,
   qui est caput, nempe Christum;

   16. From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
   that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in
   the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the
   edifying of itself in love.

   16. Ex quo totum corpus compositum et compactum per omnem juncturam
   subministrationis, secundum efficaciam in mensura uniuscujusque partis,
   incrementum corporis facit in aedificationem sui, in charitate.


   15. But, speaking the truth. Having already said that we ought not to
   be children, destitute of reason and judgment, he now enjoins us to
   grow up in the truth. [145] Though we have not arrived at man's estate,
   we ought at least, as we have already said, to be advanced children.
   The truth of God ought to have such a firm hold of us, that all the
   contrivances and attacks of Satan shall not draw us from our course;
   and yet, as we have not hitherto attained full and complete strength,
   we must make progress until death.

   He points out the design of this progress, that Christ may be the head,
   "that in all things he may have the pre-eminence," (Colossians 1:18,)
   and that in him alone we may grow in vigor or in stature. Again, we see
   that no man is excepted; all are enjoined to be subject, and to take
   their own places in the body.

   What aspect then does Popery present, but that of a crooked, deformed
   person? Is not the whole symmetry of the church destroyed, when one
   man, acting in opposition to the head, refuses to be reckoned one of
   the members? The Papists deny this, and allege that the Pope is nothing
   more than a ministerial head. But such cavils do them no service. The
   tyranny of their idol must be acknowledged to be altogether
   inconsistent with that order which Paul here recommends. In a word, a
   healthful condition of the church requires that Christ alone "must
   increase," and all others "must decrease." (John 3:30.) Whatever
   increase we obtain must be regulated in such a manner, that we shall
   remain in our own place, and contribute to exalt the head.

   When he bids us give heed to the truth in love, he uses the preposition
   in, (en,) like the corresponding Hebrew preposition v, (beth,) as
   signifying with, -- speaking the truth With love [146] If each
   individual, instead of attending exclusively to his own concerns, shall
   desire mutual intercourse, there will be agreeable and general
   progress. Such, the Apostle assures us, must be the nature of this
   harmony, that men shall not be suffered to forget the claims of truth,
   or, disregarding them, to frame an agreement according to their own
   views. This proves the wickedness of the Papists, who lay aside the
   word of God, and labor to force our compliance with their decisions.

   16. From whom the whole body. All our increase should tend to exalt
   more highly the glory of Christ. This is now proved by the best
   possible reason. It is he who supplies all our wants, and without whose
   protection we cannot be safe. As the root conveys sap to the whole
   tree, so all the vigor which we possess must flow to us from Christ.
   There are three things here which deserve our attention. The first is
   what has now been stated. All the life or health which is diffused
   through the members flows from the head; so that the members occupy a
   subordinate rank. The second is, that, by the distribution made, the
   limited share of each renders the communication between all the members
   absolutely necessary. The third is, that, without mutual love, the
   health of the body cannot be maintained. Through the members, as
   canals, is conveyed from the head all that is necessary for the
   nourishment of the body. While this connection is upheld, the body is
   alive and healthy. Each member, too, has its own proper share, --
   according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.

   Lastly, he shows that by love the church is edified, -- to the edifying
   of itself in love. This means that no increase is advantageous, which
   does not bear a just proportion to the whole body. That man is mistaken
   who desires his own separate growth. If a leg or arm should grow to a
   prodigious size, or the mouth be more fully distended, would the undue
   enlargement of those parts be otherwise than injurious to the whole
   frame? In like manner, if we wish to be considered members of Christ,
   let no man be anything for himself, but let us all be whatever we are
   for the benefit of each other. This is accomplished by love; and where
   it does not reign, there is no "edification," but an absolute
   scattering of the church.

   Ephesians 4:17-19

   17. This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
   walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind;

   17. Hoc ergo dico et testificor in Domino, ne ambuletis amplius,
   quemadmodum et gentes reliquae ambulant,

   18. Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of
   God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of
   their heart:

   18. In vanitate mentis suae, excaecatae in intelligentia, alienatae a
   vita Dei propter ignorantiam, quae in illis est, propter caecitatem
   cordis earum;

   19. Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over unto
   lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

   19. Quae postquam dolore tangi desierunt, seipsas tradiderunt
   lasciviae, ad perpetrandam omnem immunditiam cum aviditate.


   17. This I say therefore. That government which Christ has appointed
   for the edification of his church has now been considered. He next
   inquires what fruits the doctrine of the gospel ought to yield in the
   lives of Christians; or, if you prefer it, he begins to explain
   minutely the nature of that edification by which doctrine ought to be
   followed.

   That ye henceforth walk not in vanity. He first exhorts them to
   renounce the vanity of unbelievers, arguing from its inconsistency with
   their present views. That those who have been taught in the school of
   Christ, and enlightened by the doctrine of salvation, should follow
   vanity, and in no respect differ from those unbelieving and blind
   nations on whom no light of truth has ever shone, would be singularly
   foolish. On this ground he very properly calls upon them to
   demonstrate, by their life, that they had gained some advantage by
   becoming the disciples of Christ. To impart to his exhortation the
   greater earnestness, he beseeches them by the name of God, -- this I
   say and testify in the Lord, [147] -- reminding them, that, if they
   despised this instruction, they must one day give an account.

   As other Gentiles walk. He means those who had not yet been converted
   to Christ. But, at the same time, he reminds the Ephesians how
   necessary it was that they should repent, since by nature they
   resembled lost and condemned men. The miserable and shocking condition
   of other nations is held out as the motive to a change of disposition.
   He asserts that believers differ from unbelievers; and points out, as
   we shall see, the causes of this difference. With regard to the former,
   he accuses their mind of vanity: and let us remember, that he speaks
   generally of all who have not been renewed by the Spirit of Christ.

   In the vanity of their mind. Now, the mind holds the highest rank in
   the human constitution, is the seat of reason, presides over the will,
   and restrains sinful desires; so that our theologians of the Sorbonne
   are in the habit of calling her the Queen. But, Paul makes the mind to
   consist of nothing else than vanity; and, as if he had not expressed
   his meaning strongly enough, he gives no better title to her daughter,
   the understanding. Such is my interpretation of the word dianoia; for,
   though it signifies the thought, yet, as it is in the singular number,
   it refers to the thinking faculty. Plato, about the close of his Sixth
   Book on a Republic, assigns to dianoia an intermediate place between
   noesis and pistis but his observations are so entirely confined to
   geometrical subjects, as not to admit of application to this passage.
   Having formerly asserted that men see nothing, Paul now adds, that they
   are blind in reasoning, even on the most important subjects.

   Let men now go and be proud of free-will, whose guidance is here marked
   by so deep disgrace. But experience, we shall be told, is openly at
   variance with this opinion; for men are not so blind as to be incapable
   of seeing anything, nor so vain as to be incapable of forming any
   judgment. I answer, with respect to the kingdom of God, and all that
   relates to the spiritual life, the light of human reason differs little
   from darkness; for, before it has pointed out the road, it is
   extinguished; and its power of perception is little else than
   blindness, for ere it has reached the fruit, it is gone. The true
   principles held by the human mind resemble sparks; [148] but these are
   choked by the depravity of our nature, before they have been applied to
   their proper use. All men know, for instance, that there is a God, and
   that it is our duty to worship him; but such is the power of sin and
   ignorance, that from this confused knowledge we pass all at once to an
   idol, and worship it in the place of God. And even in the worship of
   God, it leads to great errors, particularly in the first table of the
   law.

   As to the second objection, our judgment does indeed agree with the law
   of God in regard to the mere outward actions; but sinful desire, which
   is the source of everything evil, escapes our notice. Besides, Paul
   does not speak merely of the natural blindness which we brought with us
   from the womb, but refers also to a still grosser blindness, by which,
   as we shall afterwards see, God punishes former transgressions. We
   conclude with observing, that the reason and understanding which men
   naturally possess, make them in the sight of God without excuse; but,
   so long as they allow themselves to live according to their natural
   disposition, they can only wander, and fall, and stumble in their
   purposes and actions. Hence it appears in what estimation and value
   false worship must appear in the sight of God, when it proceeds from
   the gulf of vanity and the maze of ignorance.

   18. Being alienated from the life of God. The life of God may either
   mean what is accounted life in the sight of God, as in that passage,

   "they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God,"
   (John 12:43,)

   or, that life which God bestows on his elect by the Spirit of
   regeneration. In both cases the meaning is the same. Our ordinary life,
   as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because
   it quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not
   keeping close to God, are dead. There are three kinds of life in this
   world. The first is animal life, which consists only of motion and the
   bodily senses, and which we have in common with the brutes; the second
   is human life, which we have as the children of Adam; and the third is
   that supernatural life, which believers alone obtain. And all of them
   are from God, so that each of them may be called the life of God. As to
   the first, Paul, in his sermon at Athens, says, (Acts 17:28,) "In him
   we live, and move, and have our being;" and the Psalmist says,

   "Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou wilt renew
   the face of the earth." (Psalm 104:30.)

   Of the second Job says,

   "Thou hast granted me life, and thy visitation hath preserved my
   spirit." (Job 10:12.)

   But the regeneration of believers is here called, by way of eminence,
   the life of God, because then does God truly live in us, and we enjoy
   his life, when he governs us by his Spirit. Of this life all men who
   are not new creatures in Christ are declared by Paul to be destitute.
   So long, then, as we remain in the flesh, that is, in ourselves, how
   wretched must be our condition! We may now form a judgment of all the
   moral virtues, as they are called; for what sort of actions will that
   life produce which, Paul affirms, is not the life of God? Before
   anything good can begin to proceed from us, we must first be renewed by
   the grace of Christ. This will be the commencement of a true, and, as
   the phrase is, a vital life.

   On account of the ignorance that is in them. We ought to attend to the
   reason which is here assigned; for, as the knowledge of God is the true
   life of the soul, so, on the contrary, ignorance is the death of it.
   And lest we should adopt the opinion of philosophers, that ignorance,
   which leads us into mistakes, is only an incidental evil, Paul shews
   that it has its root in the blindness of their heart, by which he
   intimates that it dwells in their very nature. The first blindness,
   therefore, which covers the minds of men, is the punishment of original
   sin; because Adam, after his revolt, was deprived of the true light of
   God, in the absence of which there is nothing but fearful darkness.

   19. Who being past feeling. The account which had been given of natural
   depravity is followed by a description of the worst of all evils,
   brought upon men by their own sinful conduct. Having destroyed the
   sensibilities of the heart, and allayed the stings of remorse, they
   abandon themselves to all manner of iniquity. We are by nature corrupt
   and prone to evil; nay, we are wholly inclined to evil. Those who are
   destitute of the Spirit of Christ give loose reins to self-indulgence,
   till fresh offenses, producing others in constant succession, bring
   down upon them the wrath of God. The voice of God, proclaimed by an
   accusing conscience, still continues to be heard; but, instead of
   producing its proper effects, appears rather to harden them against all
   admonition. On account of such obstinacy, they deserve to be altogether
   forsaken by God.

   The usual symptom of their having been thus forsaken is -- the
   insensibility to pain, which is here described -- being past feeling.
   Unmoved by the approaching judgment of God, whom they offend, they go
   on at their ease, and fearlessly indulge without restraint in the
   pleasures of sin. No shame is felt, no regard to character is
   maintained. The gnawing of a guilty conscience, tormented by the dread
   of the Divine judgment, may be compared to the porch of hell; but such
   hardened security as this -- is a whirlpool which swallows up and
   destroys. As Solomon says,

   "When the wicked is come to the deep, he despiseth it."
   (Proverbs 18:3.)

   Most properly, therefore, does Paul exhibit that dreadful example of
   Divine vengeance, in which men forsaken by God -- having laid
   conscience to sleep, and destroyed all fear of the Divine judgment, --
   in a word, being past feeling, -- surrender themselves with brutal
   violence to all wickedness. This is not universally the case. Many even
   of the reprobate are restrained by God, whose infinite goodness
   prevents the absolute confusion in which the world would otherwise be
   involved. The consequence is, that such open lust, such unrestrained
   intemperance, does not appear in all. It is enough that the lives of
   some present such a mirror, fitted to awaken our alarm lest anything
   similar should happen to ourselves.

   Lasciviousness (aselgeia) appears to me to denote that wantonness with
   which the flesh indulges in intemperance and licentiousness, when not
   restrained by the Spirit of God. Uncleanness is put for scandalous
   enormities of every description. It is added, with greediness. The
   Greek word pleonexia, which is so translated, often signifies
   covetousness, (Luke 12:15; 2 Peter 2:14,) and is so explained by some
   in this passage; but I cannot adopt that view. Depraved and wicked
   desires being insatiable, Paul represents them as attended and followed
   by greediness, which is the contrary of moderation.

   Ephesians 4:20-24

   20. But ye have not so learned Christ;

   20. Vos autem non ita didicistis Christum;

   21. If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as
   the truth is in Jesus:

   21. Si quidem ipsum audistis, et in ipso estis edocti, quemadmodum est
   veritas in Iesu;

   22. That ye put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man,
   which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

   22. Ut deponatis, secundum pristinam conversationem, Veterem hominem,
   qui corrumpitur secundum concupiscentias erroris;

   23. And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

   23. Renovemini autem spiritu mentis vestrae,

   24. And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.

   24. Et induatis Novum hominem, qui secundum Deum creatus est, in
   justitia et sanctitate veritatis.


   20. But ye have not. He now draws a contrast of a Christian life, so as
   to make it evident how utterly inconsistent it is with the character of
   a godly man to defile himself regardlessly with the abominations of the
   Gentiles. Because the Gentiles walk in darkness, therefore they do not
   distinguish between right and wrong; but those on whom the truth of God
   shines ought to live in a different manner. That those to whom the
   vanity of the senses is a rule of life, should yield themselves up to
   base lusts, is not surprising; but the doctrine of Christ teaches us to
   renounce our natural dispositions. He whose life differs not from that
   of unbelievers, has learned nothing of Christ; for the knowledge of
   Christ cannot be separated from the mortification of the flesh.

   21. If ye have heard him. To excite their attention and earnestness the
   more, he not only tells them that they had heard Christ, but employs a
   still stronger expression, ye have been taught in him, as if he had
   said, that this doctrine had not been slightly pointed out, but
   faithfully delivered and explained.

   As the truth is in Jesus. This contains a reproof of that superficial
   knowledge of the gospel, by which many are elated, who are wholly
   unacquainted with newness of life. They think that they are exceedingly
   wise, but the apostle pronounces it to be a false and mistaken opinion.
   There is a twofold knowledge of Christ, -- one, which is true and
   genuine, -- and another, which is counterfeit and spurious. Not that,
   strictly speaking, there are two kinds; but most men falsely imagine
   that they know Christ, while they know nothing but what is carnal. In
   another Epistle he says,

   "If any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature."
   (2 Corinthians 5:17.)

   So here he affirms that any knowledge of Christ, which is not
   accompanied by mortification of the flesh, is not true and sincere.

   22. That ye put off. He demands from a Christian man repentance, or a
   new life, which he makes to consist of self-denial and the regeneration
   of the Holy Spirit. Beginning with the first, he enjoins us to lay
   aside, or put off the old man, employing the metaphor of garments,
   which we have already had occasion to explain. The old man, -- as we
   have repeatedly stated, in expounding [7]the sixth chapter of the
   Epistle to the Romans, and other passages where it occurs, -- means the
   natural disposition which we bring with us from our mother's womb. In
   two persons, Adam and Christ, he describes to us what may be called two
   natures. As we are first born of Adam, the depravity of nature which we
   derive from him is called the Old man; and as we are born again in
   Christ, the amendment of this sinful nature is called the New man. In a
   word, he who desires to put off the old man must renounce his nature.
   To suppose that the words Old and New contain an allusion to the Old
   and New Testaments, is exceedingly unphilosophical.

   Concerning the former conversation. To make it more evident that this
   exhortation to the Ephesians was not unnecessary, he reminds them of
   their former life. "Before Christ revealed himself to your minds, the
   old man reigned in you; and therefore, if you desire to lay him aside,
   you must renounce your former life." Which is corrupted. He describes
   the old man from the fruits, that is, from the wicked desires, which
   allure men to destruction; for the word, corrupt, alludes to old age,
   which is closely allied to corruption. Let us beware of considering the
   deceitful lusts, as the Papists do, to mean nothing more than the gross
   and visible lusts, which are generally acknowledged to be base. The
   word includes also those dispositions which, instead of being censured,
   are sometimes applauded, -- such as ambition, cunning, and everything
   that proceeds either from self-love or from want of confidence in God.

   23. And be renewed. The second part of the rule for a devout and holy
   life is to live, not in our own spirit, but in the Spirit of Christ.
   But what is meant by -- the spirit of your mind? I understand it simply
   to mean, -- Be renewed, not only with respect to the inferior appetites
   or desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that
   part of the soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent. And here
   again, he brings forward to view that Queen which philosophers are
   accustomed almost to adore. There is an implied contrast between the
   spirit of our mind and the Divine and heavenly Spirit, who produces in
   us another and a new mind. How much there is in us that is sound or
   uncorrupted may be easily gathered from this passage, which enjoins us
   to correct chiefly the reason or mind, in which we are apt to imagine
   that there is nothing but what is virtuous and deserves commendation.

   24. And that ye put on the new man. All that is meant is, "Be renewed
   in the spirit, or, be renewed within or completely, -- beginning with
   the mind, which appears to be the part most free from all taint of
   sin." What is added about the creation, may refer either to the first
   creation of man, or to the second creation, which is effected by the
   grace of Christ. Both expositions will be true. Adam was at first
   created after the image of God, and reflected, as in a mirror, the
   Divine righteousness; but that image, having been defaced by sin, must
   now be restored in Christ. The regeneration of the godly is indeed --
   as we have formerly explained [149] -- nothing else than the formation
   anew of the image of God in them. There is, no doubt, a far more rich
   and powerful manifestation of Divine grace in this second creation than
   in the first; but our highest perfection is uniformly represented in
   Scripture as consisting in our conformity and resemblance to God. Adam
   lost the image which he had originally received, and therefore it
   becomes necessary that it shall be restored to us by Christ. The design
   contemplated by regeneration is to recall us from our wanderings to
   that end for which we were created.

   In righteousness. If righteousness be taken as a general term for
   uprightness, holiness will be something higher, or that purity which
   lies in being devoted to the service of God. I am rather inclined to
   consider holiness as referring to the first table, and righteousness to
   the second table, of the law, as in the song of Zacharias,

   "That we may serve him in holiness and righteousness, all the days of
   our life." (Luke 1:74,75.)

   Plato lays down the distinction correctly, that holiness (hosiotes)
   lies in the worship of God, and that the other part, righteousness,
   (dikaiosune,) bears a reference to men. The genitive, of truth, (tos
   aletheias,) is put in the place of an adjective, and refers to both
   terms; so that, while it literally runs, in righteousness and holiness
   of truth, the meaning is, in true righteousness and holiness. He warns
   us that both ought to be sincere; because we have to do with God, whom
   it is impossible to deceive.

   Ephesians 4:25-28

   25. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
   neighbor: for we are members one of another.

   25. Quare, deposito mendacio, loquimini veritatem unusquisque cum
   proximo suo; quia sumus vicissim inter nos membra.

   26. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:

   26. Irascimini, et ne peccetis. (Psalm 4:5.) Sol non occidat super
   iracundiam vestram:

   27. Neither give place to the devil.

   27. Et ne detis locum diabolo.

   28. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working
   with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him
   that needeth.

   28. Qui furabatur, jam non furetur; magis autem laboret, operando quod
   bonum est manibus, ut habeat quod eroget opus habenti.


   25. Wherefore, putting away lying. From this head of doctrine, that is,
   from the righteousness of the new man, all godly exhortations flow,
   like streams from a fountain; for if all the precepts which relate to
   life were collected, yet, without this principle, they would be of
   little value. Philosophers take a different method; but, in the
   doctrine of godliness, there is no other way than this for regulating
   the life. Now, therefore, he comes to lay down particular exhortations,
   drawn from the general doctrine. Having concluded from the truth of the
   gospel, that righteousness and holiness ought to be true, he now argues
   from the general statement to a particular instance, that every man
   should speak truth with his neighbour. Lying is here put for every kind
   of deceit, hypocrisy, or cunning; and truth for honest dealing. He
   demands that every kind of communication between them shall be sincere;
   and enforces it by this consideration, for we are members one of
   another. That members should not agree among themselves, -- that they
   should act in a deceitful manner towards each other, is prodigious
   wickedness.

   26. Be ye angry, and sin not. Whether or not the apostle had in his eye
   a part of the fourth Psalm is uncertain. The words used by him
   ('Orgizesthe kai ue hamartanete) occur in the Greek translation, though
   the word orgizesthe, which is translated, be ye angry, is considered by
   some to mean tremble. [150] The Hebrew verb rgz (ragaz) signifies
   either to be agitated by anger, or, to tremble. As to the passage of
   the Psalm, the idea of trembling will be quite appropriate. "Do not
   choose to resemble madmen, who rush fearlessly in any direction, but
   let the dread of being accounted foolhardy keep you in awe." The word
   sometimes signifies to strive or quarrel, as, in that instance,
   (Genesis 45:24,) "See that ye fall not out by the way;" and
   accordingly, the Psalmist adds, "Commune with your own heart, and be
   still," -- abstain from furious encounters.

   In my opinion, Paul merely alludes to the passage with the following
   view. There are three faults by which we offend God in being angry. The
   first is, when our anger arises from slight causes, and often from no
   cause whatever, or at least from private injuries or offenses. The
   second is, when we go beyond the proper bounds, and are hurried into
   intemperate excesses. The third is, when our anger, which ought to have
   been directed against ourselves or against sins, is turned against our
   brethren. Most appropriately, therefore, did Paul, when he wished to
   describe the proper limitation of anger, employ the well-known passage,
   Be ye angry, and sin not. We comply with this injunction, if the
   objects of our anger are sought, not in others, but in ourselves, -- if
   we pour out our indignation against our own faults. With respect to
   others, we ought to be angry, not at their persons, but at their
   faults; nor ought we to be excited to anger by private offenses, but by
   zeal for the glory of the Lord. Lastly, our anger, after a reasonable
   time, ought to be allowed to subside, without mixing itself with the
   violence of carnal passions.

   Let not the sun go down. It is scarcely possible, however, but that we
   shall sometimes give way to improper and sinful passion, -- so strong
   is the tendency of the human mind to what is evil. Paul therefore
   suggests a second remedy, that we shall quickly suppress our anger, and
   not suffer it to gather strength by continuance. The first remedy was,
   Be ye angry, and sin not; but, as the great weakness of human nature
   renders this exceedingly difficult, the next is -- not to cherish wrath
   too long in our minds, or allow it sufficient time to become strong. He
   enjoins accordingly, let not the sun go down upon your wrath. If at any
   time we happen to be angry, let us endeavor to be appeased before the
   sun has set.

   27. Neither give place (to diabolo) to the devil. I am aware of the
   interpretation which some give of this passage. Erasmus, who translates
   it, "neither give place to the Slanderer," (calumniatori,) shews
   plainly that he understood it as referring to malicious men. But I have
   no doubt, Paul's intention was, to guard us against allowing Satan to
   take possession of our minds, and, by keeping in his hands this
   citadel, to do whatever he pleases. We feel every day how impossible,
   or, at least, how difficult it is to cure long-continued hatred. What
   is the cause of this, but that, instead of resisting the devil, we
   yield up to him the possession of our heart? Before the poison of
   hatred has found its way into the heart, anger must be thoroughly
   dislodged.

   28. Let him that stole steal no more. This includes not merely the
   grosser thefts which are punished by human laws, but those of a more
   concealed nature, which do not fall under the cognizance of men, --
   every kind of depredation by which we seize the property of others. But
   he does not simply forbid us to take that property in an unjust or
   unlawful manner. He enjoins us to assist our brethren, as far as lies
   in our power.

   That he may have to give to him that needeth. "Thou who formerly
   stolest must not only obtain thy subsistence by lawful and harmless
   toil, but must give assistance to others." He is first required to
   labor, working with his hands, that he may not supply his wants at the
   expense of his brethren, but may support life by honorable labor. But
   the love which we owe to our neighbor carries us much farther. No one
   must live to himself alone, and neglect others. All must labor to
   supply each other's necessities.

   But a question arises, does Paul oblige all men to labor with their
   hands? This would be excessively hard. I reply, the meaning is plain,
   if it be duly considered. Every man is forbidden to steal. But many
   people are in the habit of pleading want, and that excuse is obviated
   by enjoining them rather to labor (mallon de kopiato) with their hands.
   As if he had said, "No condition, however hard or disagreeable, can
   entitle any man to do injury to another, or even to refrain from
   contributing to the necessities of his brethren.

   The thing which is good. This latter clause, which contains an argument
   from the greater to the less, gives no small additional strength to the
   exhortation. As there are many occupations which do little to promote
   the lawful enjoyments of men, he recommends to them to choose those
   employments which yield the greatest advantage to their neighbors. We
   need not wonder at this. If those trades which can have no other effect
   than to lead men into immorality, were denounced by heathens -- and
   Cicero among the number -- as highly disgraceful, would an apostle of
   Christ reckon them among the lawful callings of God?

   Ephesians 4:29-31

   29. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
   which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
   the hearers.

   29. Omnis sermo spurcus ex ore vestro non procedat; sed si quis est
   bonus ad edificationem usus, ut det gratiam audientibus.

   30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
   the day of redemption.

   30. Et ne contristetis Spiritum Sanctum Dei, quo obsignati estis in
   diem redemptionis.

   31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and
   evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.

   31. Omnis amarulentia, et indignatio, et ira, et clamor, et
   maledicentia, removeatur a vobis cum omni malitia.


   29. No filthy speech. He first forbids believers to use any filthy
   language, including under this name all those expressions which are
   wont to be employed for the purpose of inflaming lust. Not satisfied
   with the removal of the vice, he enjoins them to frame their discourse
   for edification. In another Epistle he says, "Let your speech be
   seasoned with salt." (Colossians 4:6.) Here a different phrase is
   employed, if any (speech) be good to the use of edifying, which means
   simply, if it be useful. The genitive, of use, may no doubt be viewed,
   according to the Hebrew idiom, as put for an adjective, so that for the
   edification of use (pros oikodomen tos chreias) may mean for useful
   edification; but when I consider how frequently, and in how extensive a
   meaning, the metaphor of edifying occurs in Paul's writings, I prefer
   the former exposition. The edification of use will thus mean the
   progress of our edification, for to edify is to carry forward. To
   explain the manner in which this is done, he adds, that it may impart
   grace to the hearers, meaning by the word grace, comfort, advice, and
   everything that aids the salvation of the soul.

   30. And grieve not. As the Holy Spirit dwells in us, to him every part
   of our soul and of our body ought to be devoted. But if we give
   ourselves up to aught that is impure, we may be said to drive him away
   from making his abode with us; and, to express this still more
   familiarly, human affections, such as joy and grief, are ascribed to
   the Holy Spirit. [151] Endeavour that the Holy Spirit may dwell
   cheerfully with you, as in a pleasant and joyful dwelling, and give him
   no occasion for grief. Some take a different view of it, that we grieve
   the Holy Spirit in others, when we offend by filthy language, or, in
   any other way, godly brethren, who are led by the Spirit of God.
   (Romans 8:14.) Whatever is contrary to godliness is not only
   disrelished by godly ears, but is no sooner heard than it produces in
   them deep grief and pain. But that Paul's meaning was different appears
   from what follows.

   By whom ye are sealed. As God has sealed us by his Spirit, we grieve
   him when we do not follow his guidance, but pollute ourselves by wicked
   passions. No language can adequately express this solemn truth, that
   the Holy Spirit rejoices and is glad on our account, when we are
   obedient to him in all things, and neither think nor speak anything,
   but what is pure and holy; and, on the other hand, is grieved, when we
   admit anything into our minds that is unworthy of our calling. Now, let
   any man reflect what shocking wickedness there must be in grieving the
   Holy Spirit to such a degree as to compel him to withdraw from us. The
   same mode of speaking is used by the prophet Isaiah, but in a different
   sense; for he merely says, that they "vexed his Holy Spirit," (Isaiah
   63:10.) in the same sense in which we are accustomed to speak of vexing
   the mind of a man. By whom ye are sealed. The Spirit of God is the
   seal, by which we are distinguished from the wicked, and which is
   impressed on our hearts as a sure evidence of adoption.

   Unto the day of redemption, -- that is, till God conduct us into the
   possession of the promised inheritance. That day is usually called the
   day of redemption, because we shall then be at length delivered out of
   all our afflictions. It is unnecessary to make any observations on this
   phrase, in addition to what have already been made in expounding Romans
   8:23, and 1 Corinthians 1:30. In this passage, the word sealed may have
   a different meaning from that which it usually bears, -- that God has
   impressed his Spirit as his mark upon us, that he may recognize as his
   children those whom he perceives to bear that mark.

   31. Let all bitterness. He again condemns anger; but, on the present
   occasion, views in connection with it those offenses by which it is
   usually accompanied, such as noisy disputes and reproaches. Between
   wrath and anger (Thumon kai orgen) there is little difference, except
   that the former denotes the power, and the latter the act; but here,
   the only difference is, that anger is a more sudden attack. The
   correction of all the rest will be greatly aided by the removal of
   malice. By this term he expresses that depravity of mind which is
   opposed to humanity and justice, and which is usually called malignity.

   [151] "According to our view, the verse is a summation of the argument

   deviation from the truth -- if they shall indulge in fitful rage, or
   cherish sullen and malignant dislikes -- if they shall be characterized
   by dishonesty, or insipid and corrupt language, then do they grieve the
   Holy Spirit of God; for all this perverse insubordination is in utter
   antagonism to the essence and operations of Him who is the Spirit of
   truth; and inspires the love of it; who assumed, as a fitting symbol,
   the form of a dove, and creates meekness and forbearance; and who, as
   the Spirit of holiness, leads to the appreciation of all that is just
   in action, noble in sentiment, and healthful and edifying in speech."

   Ephesians 4:32

   32. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
   another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

   32. Sitis autem mutuo comes, misericordes, condonantes vobis inter vos,
   quemadmodum et Deus vobis in Christo condonavit.


   32. And be ye kind one to another. With bitterness he contrasts
   kindness, or gentleness of countenance, language, and manners. And as
   this virtue will never reign in us, unless attended by compassion,
   (oumpatheia,) he recommends to us to be tender-hearted This will lead
   us not only to sympathize with the distresses of our brethren, as if
   they were our own, but to cultivate that true humanity which is
   affected by everything that happens to them, in the same manner as if
   we were in their situation. The contrary of this is the cruelty of
   those iron-hearted, barbarous men, by whom the sufferings of others are
   beheld without any concern whatever.

   Forgiving one another. The Greek word here rendered forgiving,
   (charizomenoi heautois,) is supposed by to mean beneficence. Erasmus,
   accordingly, renders it (largientes) bountiful. Though the word admits
   of that meaning, yet the context induces me to prefer the other view,
   that we should be ready to forgive It may sometimes happen, that men
   are kind and tender-hearted, and yet, when they receive improper
   treatment, do not so easily forgive injuries. That those whose kindness
   of heart in other respects disposes them to acts of humanity, may not
   fail in their duty through the ingratitude of men, he exhorts them to
   discover a readiness to lay aside resentment. To give his exhortation
   the greater weight, he holds out the example of God, who has forgiven
   to us, through Christ, far more than any mortal man can forgive to his
   brethren. [152]

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ephesians 5:1-2

   1. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

   1. Sitis ergo imitatores Dei quemadmodum filii dilecti;

   2. And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
   himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
   savor.

   2. Et ambulate in charitate quemadmodum et Christus nos dilexit, ac se
   ipsum tradidit pro nobis oblationem et hostiam Deo, in odorem bonae
   fragrantiae.


   1. Be ye therefore followers. The same principle is followed out and
   enforced by the consideration that children ought to be like their
   father. He reminds us that we are the children of God, and that
   therefore we ought, as far as possible, to resemble Him in acts of
   kindness. It is impossible not to perceive, that the division of
   chapters, in the present instance, is particularly unhappy, as it has
   made a separation between parts of the subject which are very closely
   related. If, then, we are the children of God, we ought to be followers
   of God. Christ also declares, that, unless we shew kindness to the
   unworthy, we cannot be the children of our heavenly Father.

   "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
   hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you;
   that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he
   maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on
   the just and on the unjust."
   (Matthew 5:44,45.) [153]

   2. And walk in love as Christ also hath loved us. Having called on us
   to imitate God, he now calls on us to imitate Christ, who is our true
   model. We ought to embrace each other with that love with which Christ
   has embraced us, for what we perceive in Christ is our true guide.

   And gave himself for us. This was a remarkable proof of the highest
   love. Forgetful, as it were, of himself, Christ spared not his own
   life, that he might redeem us from death. If we desire to be partakers
   of this benefit, we must cultivate similar affections toward our
   neighbors. Not that any of us has reached such high perfection, but all
   must aim and strive according to the measure of their ability.

   An offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savor. While
   this statement leads us to admire the grace of Christ, it bears
   directly on the present subject. No language, indeed, can fully
   represent the consequences and efficacy of Christ's death. This is the
   only price by which we are reconciled to God. The doctrine of faith on
   this subject holds the highest rank. But the more extraordinary the
   discoveries which have reached us of the Redeemer's kindness, the more
   strongly are we bound to his service. Besides, we may infer from Paul's
   words, that, unless we love one another, none of our duties will be
   acceptable in the sight of God. If the reconciliation of men, effected
   by Christ, was a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor, [154] we, too,
   shall be "unto God a sweet savor," (2 Corinthians 2:15,) when this holy
   perfume is spread over us. To this applies the saying of Christ,

   "Leave thy gift before the altar, and go and be reconciled to thy
   brother." (Matthew 5:24.)

   Eadie.

   [154] "The offering, in being presented to God, was meant to be, and
   actually was, a sweet savor to Him. The phrase is based on the peculiar
   sacrificial idiom of the Old Testament. (Genesis 8:21; Leviticus 1:9,

   is explained and expanded in Philippians 4:18 -- a sacrifice
   acceptable, well-pleasing to God.' The burning of spices or incense, so
   fragrant to the Oriental senses, is figuratively applied to God." --

   Ephesians 5: 3-7

   3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be
   once named among you, as becometh saints;

   3. Scortatio vero et omnis immundities, aut avaritia, ne nominentur
   quidem inter vos; sicut decet sanctos.

   4. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
   convenient; but rather giving of thanks.

   4. Turpitudo, stultiloquium, facetia; quae non conveniunt, sed magis
   gratia.

   5. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
   covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
   of Christ and of God.

   5. Hoc enim scitis, quod omnis scortator, vel immundus, vel avarus, qui
   est idololatra, non obtinebit haereditatem in regno Christi et Dei.

   6. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things
   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

   6. Nemo vos decipiat inanibus verbis; nam propter haec venit ira Dei in
   filios inobedientes (vel, incredulos.)

   7. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

   7. Ne sitis igitur illorum consortes.


   3. But fornication. This chapter, and the third of the Epistle to the
   Colossians, contain many parallel passages, which an intelligent reader
   will be at no loss to compare without my assistance. Three things are
   here enumerated, which the apostle desires Christians to hold in such
   abhorrence, that they shall not even be named, or, in other words,
   shall be entirely unknown among them. By uncleanness he means all base
   and impure lusts; so that this word differs from fornication, only as
   the whole class differs from a single department. The third is
   covetousness, which is nothing more than an immoderate desire of gain.
   To this precept he adds the authoritative declaration, that he demands
   nothing from them but that which becometh saints, -- manifestly
   excluding from the number and fellowship of the saints all fornicators,
   and impure and covetous persons.

   4. Neither filthiness. To those three -- other three are now added. By
   filthiness I understand all that is indecent or inconsistent with the
   modesty of the godly. By foolish talking I understand conversations
   that are either unprofitably or wickedly foolish; and as it frequently
   happens that idle talk is concealed under the garb of jesting or wit,
   he expressly mentions pleasantry, -- which is so agreeable as to seem
   worthy of commendation, -- and condemns it as a part of foolish talking
   The Greek word eutrapelia is often used by heathen writers, in a good
   sense, for that ready and ingenious pleasantry in which able and
   intelligent men may properly indulge. But as it is exceedingly
   difficult to be witty without becoming satirical, and as jesting itself
   carries in it a portion of conceit not at all in keeping with the
   character of a godly man, Paul very properly dissuades from this
   practice. [155] Of all the three offenses now mentioned, Paul declares
   that they are not convenient, or, in other words, that they are
   inconsistent with Christian duty.

   But rather grace. Others render it giving of thanks; but I prefer
   Jerome's interpretation. With the vices which had been formerly
   mentioned it was proper that Paul should contrast something of a
   general character, displaying itself in all our communications with
   each other. If he had said, "While they take pleasure in idle or
   abusive talk, do you give thanks to God," the exhortation would have
   been too limited. The Greek word, eucharistia, though it usually
   signifies Thanksgiving, admits of being translated Grace. "All our
   conversations ought to be, in the true sense of the words, sweet and
   graceful; and this end will be gained if the useful and the agreeable
   are properly mingled."

   5. For this ye know. If his readers were at all captivated by the
   allurements of those vices which have been enumerated, the consequence
   would be that they would lend a hesitating or careless ear to his
   admonitions. He determines, therefore, to alarm them by this weighty
   and dreadful threatening, that such vices shut against us the kingdom
   of God. By appealing to their own knowledge, he intimates that this was
   no doubtful matter. Some might think it harsh, or inconsistent with the
   Divine goodness, that all who have incurred the guilt of fornication or
   covetousness are excluded from the inheritance of the kingdom of
   heaven. But the answer is easy. Paul does not say that those who have
   fallen into those sins, and recovered from them, are not pardoned, but
   pronounces sentence on the sins themselves. After addressing the
   Corinthians in the same language, he adds:

   "And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
   but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit
   of our God."
   (1 Corinthians 6:11.)

   When men have repented, and thus give evidence that they are reconciled
   to God, they are no longer the same persons that they formerly were.
   But let all fornicators, or unclean or covetous persons, so long as
   they continue such, be assured that they have no friendship with God,
   and are deprived of all hope of salvation. It is called the kingdom of
   Christ and of God, because God hath given it to his Son that we may
   obtain it through him.

   Nor covetous man, who is an idolater. "Covetousness," as he says in
   another place, "is idolatry," (Colossians 3:5,) -- not the idolatry
   which is so frequently condemned in Scripture, but one of a different
   description. All covetous men must deny God, and put wealth in his
   place; such is their blind greediness of wretched gain. But why does
   Paul attribute to covetousness alone what belongs equally to other
   carnal passions? In what respect is covetousness better entitled to
   this disgraceful name than ambition, or than a vain confidence in
   ourselves? I answer, that this disease is widely spread, and not a few
   minds have caught the infection. Nay, it is not reckoned a disease, but
   receives, on the contrary, very general commendation. This accounts for
   the harshness of Paul's language, which arose from a desire to tear
   from our hearts the false view.

   6. Let no man deceive you. There have always been ungodly dogs, [156]
   by whom the threatenings of the prophets were made the subject of
   merriment and ridicule. We find such characters in our own day. In all
   ages, indeed, Satan raises up sorcerers of this description, who
   endeavor by unholy scoffs to escape the Divine judgment, and who
   actually exercise a kind of fascination over consciences not
   sufficiently established in the fear of God. "This is a trivial fault.
   Fornication is viewed by God as a light matter. Under the law of grace
   God is not so cruel. He has not formed us so as to be our own
   executioners. The frailty of nature excuses us." These and similar
   expressions are often used by the scoffers. Paul, on the contrary,
   exclaims that we must guard against that sophistry by which consciences
   are ensnared to their ruin.

   For because of these things cometh the wrath of God. If we consider the
   present tense to be here used, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, for the
   future, these words are a threatening of the last judgment. But I agree
   with those who take the word cometh in an indefinite sense, -- the word
   of God usually cometh, -- as reminding them of the ordinary judgments
   of God which were executed before their own eyes. And certainly, if we
   were not blind and slothful, there are sufficiently numerous examples
   by which God testifies that he is the just avenger of such crimes, --
   examples of the pouring out of divine indignation, privately against
   individuals, and publicly against cities, and kings, and nations.

   Upon the children of disobedience, -- upon unbelievers or rebels. This
   expression must not be overlooked. Paul is now addressing believers,
   and his object is not so much to present alarming views of their own
   danger, as to rouse them to behold reflected in wicked men, as in
   mirrors, the dreadful judgments of God. God does not make himself an
   object of terror to his children, that they may avoid him, but does all
   that can be done in a fatherly manner, to draw them to himself. They
   ought to learn this lesson, not to involve themselves in a dangerous
   fellowship with the ungodly, whose ruin is thus foreseen.

   [155] "He doth not condemn the innocent pleasantries and mirth of a
   cheerful conversation; but that kind of obscene discourse which we mean
   by the French expression of double entendre; when men, for the sake of
   merriment and sport, convey lewd sentiments and thoughts to others,
   under chaste and cleanly expressions. This seems to be the proper
   meaning of the word eutrapelia, jesting, in this place. The original
   sense of it is, an artfully turned discourse.' And accordingly it is
   used either in a good sense, to denote proper wit; or in a bad sense,
   to signify any kind of lewd and scurrilous discourse, that artfully
   conveys an ill meaning. And as it is here joined with filthiness and
   foolish talking,' it is plain that the apostle intended by it such
   ambiguous forms of speech as are intended to raise mirth by dishonest
   and corrupt meanings." -- Chandler.

   Ephesians 5:8-14

   8. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
   walk as children of light;

   8. Eratis aliquando tenabrae; nunc autem lux in Domino; tanquam filii
   lucis ambulate;

   9. (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness,
   and truth;)

   9. (Fructus enim lucis in omni bonitate, et justitia, et veritate:)

   10. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

   10. Probantes, quid sit acceptum Deo.

   11. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
   rather reprove them

   11. Et ne communicetis operibus infructuosis tenebrarum; quin potius
   etiam redarguitote.

   12. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
   them in secret.

   12. Quae enim clam fiunt ab illis, turpe est vel dicere.

   13. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
   for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

   13. Omnia autem, dum coarguuntur, a luce manifestantur; omne enim quod
   manifestat lux est.

   14. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
   dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

   14. Quamobrem dicit: Surge qui dormis, et exsurge ex mortuis; et
   illucescet tibi Christus.


   8. For ye were once darkness. The precepts which immediately follow
   derive greater weight from the motives with which they are mingled.
   Having spoken of unbelievers, and warned the Ephesians not to become
   partakers of their crimes and their destruction, he argues still
   further, that they ought to differ widely from the life and conduct of
   those men. At the same time, in order to guard them against ingratitude
   to God, he refreshes their remembrance of their own past life. "You
   ought," he says, "to be very different persons from what you formerly
   were; for out of darkness God hath made you light." Darkness is the
   name here given to the whole nature of man before regeneration; for,
   where the brightness of God does not shine, there is nothing but
   fearful darkness. Light, again, is the name given to those who are
   enlightened by the Spirit of God; for immediately afterwards in the
   same sense, he calls them children of light, and draws the inference,
   that they ought to walk in light, because by the mercy of God they had
   been rescued from darkness. Observe here, we are said to be light in
   the Lord, because, while we are out of Christ, all is under the
   dominion of Satan, whom we know to be the Prince of darkness.

   9. For the fruit of the light. [157] This parenthesis is introduced, to
   point out the road in which the children of light ought to walk. A
   complete description is not given, but a few parts of a holy and pious
   life are introduced by way of example. To give them a general view of
   duty, their attention is again directed to the will of God. Whoever
   desires to live in a proper and safe manner, let him resolve to obey
   God, and to take his will as the rule. To regulate life entirely by his
   command is, as he says in another Epistle, a reasonable service,
   (Romans 12:1,) or, as another inspired man expresses it, To obey is
   better than sacrifice. (1 Samuel 15:22.) I wonder how the word Spirit
   (pneumatos) has crept into many Greek manuscripts, as the other reading
   is more consistent, -- the fruit of the light Paul's meaning indeed is
   not affected; for in either case it will be this, that believers must
   walk in the light, because they are "children of the light." This is
   done, when they do not live according to their own will, but devote
   themselves entirely to obedience to God, -- when they undertake nothing
   but by his command. Besides, such obedience is testified by its fruits,
   such as goodness, righteousness, and truth.

   11. And have no fellowship. As "the children of light" dwell amidst the
   darkness, or, in other words, in the midst of "a perverse and crooked
   generation," (Deuteronomy 32:5,) -- there is good reason for warning
   them to keep themselves apart from wicked actions. It is not enough
   that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must
   beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong. In short, we must
   abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or
   assistance; for in all these ways we have fellowship. And lest any one
   should imagine that he has done his duty, merely by not conniving, he
   adds, but rather reprove them. [158] Such a course is opposed to all
   dissimulation. Where a manifest offense is committed against God, every
   man will be eager to vindicate himself from any share in the guilt, but
   very few will guard against connivance; nearly all will practice some
   kind of dissimulation. But rather than the truth of God shall not
   remain unshaken, let a hundred worlds perish.

   The word elenchein, which is translated reprove, answers to the
   metaphor of darkness; for it literally signifies to drag forth to the
   light what was formerly unknown. As ungodly men flatter themselves in
   their vices, (Psalm 36:2,) and wish their crimes to be concealed, or to
   be reckoned virtues, Paul enjoins that they shall be reproved. He calls
   them unfruitful; because they not only do no good, but are absolutely
   hurtful.

   12. Which are done by them in secret. This shews the advantage of
   reproving the ungodly. If they do but escape the eyes of men, there is
   no crime, however shocking to be mentioned, which they will not
   perpetrate. To use a common proverb, "Night has no shame." What is the
   reason of this? Sunk in the darkness of ignorance, they neither see
   their own baseness, nor think that it is seen by God and by angels. But
   let the torch of God's word be brought forward, and their eyes are
   opened. Then they begin to blush and be ashamed. By their advices and
   reproofs the saints enlighten blind unbelievers, and drag forth from
   their concealment to the light of day those who were sunk in ignorance.

   When unbelievers keep the doors of their houses shut, and withdraw from
   the view of men, it is a shame even to speak of the baseness and
   wickedness with which they rush into all manner of licentiousness.
   Would they thus lay aside all shame, and give loose reins to their
   passions, if darkness did not give them courage, -- if they did not
   entertain the hope that what is hidden will pass unpunished? But do
   you, by reproving them, bring forward the light, that they may be
   ashamed of their own baseness. Such shame, arising from an
   acknowledgment of baseness, is the first step to repentance.

   "If there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is
   convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of his
   heart made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he worships God"
   (1 Corinthians 14:24,25.)

   It may be thought that the word is used here in an unusual acceptation.
   Erasmus, by substituting another word for reprove, has destroyed the
   whole meaning; for Paul's object is to shew that it will not be without
   advantage if the works of unbelievers are reproved.

   13. But when all things are reproved. As the participle,
   (phaneroumenon,) which is translated, that which doth make manifest, is
   in the middle voice, it admits either of a passive or active
   signification. It may be either rendered, that which is made manifest,
   or that which doth make manifest. If the passive signification, which
   is followed by the ancient translator, be preferred, the word light
   will denote, as formerly, that which gives light, and the meaning will
   be, that evil works, which had been concealed, will stand out to public
   view, when they have been made manifest by the word of God: If the
   participle be taken actively, there will still be two ways of
   expounding it: 1. Whatever manifests is light; 2. That which manifests
   anything or all things, is light; taking the singular as put for the
   plural number. There is no difficulty, as Erasmus dreaded, about the
   article; for the apostles are not in the habit of adhering very
   strictly to rule about placing every article, and even among elegant
   writers this mode of using it would be allowable. The context appears
   to me to shew clearly that this is Paul's meaning. He had exhorted them
   to reprove the evil works of unbelievers, and thus to drag them out of
   darkness; and he now adds, that what he enjoins upon them is the proper
   business of light -- to make manifest It is Light, he says, which makes
   all things manifest; and hence it followed that they were unworthy of
   the name, if they did not bring to light what was involved in darkness.

   14. Wherefore he saith. Interpreters are at great pains to discover the
   passage of Scripture which Paul appears to quote, and which is nowhere
   to be found. I shall state my opinion. He first exhibits Christ as
   speaking by his ministers; for this is the ordinary message which is
   every day delivered by preachers of the gospel. What other object do
   they propose than to raise the dead to life?

   "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
   the Son of God, and they that hear shall live"
   (John 5:25.)

   Let us now attend to the context. "Unbelievers," Paul had said, "must
   be reproved, that, being brought forth to the light, they may begin to
   acknowledge their wickedness." He therefore represents Christ as
   uttering a voice which is constantly heard in the preaching of the
   gospel,

   Arise, thou that sleepest. The allusion, I have no doubt, is to the
   prophecies which relate to Christ's kingdom; such as that of Isaiah,

   "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah
   is risen upon thee" (Isaiah 60:1.)

   Let us therefore endeavor, as far as lies in our power, to rouse the
   sleeping and dead, that we may bring them to the light of Christ.

   And Christ shall give thee light. This does not mean that, when we have
   risen from death to life, his light begins to shine upon us, as if our
   performances came before his grace. All that is intended is to show
   that, when Christ enlightens us, we rise from death to life, -- and
   thus to confirm the former statement, that unbelievers must be
   recovered from their blindness, in order to be saved. Instead of
   epiphausei, he shall give light, some copies read ephapsetai, he shall
   touch; but this reading is an evident blunder, and may be dismissed
   without any argument. [159]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [157] The English version reads, The fruit of the Spirit; Calvin's, The
   fruit of light. Without attempting, in a brief note, to balance the
   various readings, it may be proper to mention, that, instead of
   pneumatos, (of the Spirit,) many Greek manuscripts have thotos, (of the
   light,) and the latter reading has been adopted by Griesbach. -- Ed

   [158] "Most expositors supply autous, meaning the doers of the works;
   and they render elenchete, reprove, viz., by wholesome correction.
   This, however, is so harsh, that it is better (with Theodoret, the
   Pesch. Syr., Wakefield, Schleusner, Photius, and Wahl) to supply auta,
   that is, erga tou skotous, and to interpret elenchete bring to the
   light, and evince their evil nature,' namely, by shewing in contrast
   the opposite virtues. This sense is required by verse 13, with which
   the present closely connects; and so elencho is used both in the
   Scriptural and Classical writers." -- Bloomfield.

   [159] "The various spellings of the verb, and the change of ph into ps,
   have arisen from inadvertence. This variation is as old as the days of
   Chrysostom; for he notices it, and decides for the common reading. The
   verb itself occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though it is once
   found in the Acts of Thomas,' section 34. That light from Christ
   flashes upon the awakened and resuscitated; nay, it awakens and
   resuscitates them. As it streams upon the dead, it startles them into
   life. It illuminates every topic on which a sinner needs information,
   with a pure, steady, and mellowed radiance." -- Eadie.

   Ephesians 5:15-20

   15. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

   15. Videte igitur, quomodo exacte ambuletis; non tanquam insipientes,
   sed tanquam sapientes:

   16. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

   16. Redimentes tempus, quoniam dies mali sunt.

   17. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the
   Lord is

   17. Quare ne sitis imprudentes, sed intelligentes, quae sit voluntas
   Domini.

   18. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
   the Spirit;

   18. Et ne inebriemini vino, in quo inest lascivia, sed impleamini
   Spiritu.

   19. Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

   19. Vobis ipsis loquentes psalmis et hymnis, et canticis spiritualibus,
   canentes et psallentes in corde vestro, Domino;

   20. Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the
   name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   20. Gratias agentes semper de omnibus, in nomine Domini nostri Iesu
   Christi, Deo et Patri.


   15. See then. If believers must not neglect to drive away the darkness
   of others by their own brightness, how much less ought they to be blind
   as to their own conduct in life? What darkness shall conceal those on
   whom Christ, the Sun of righteousness, has arisen? Placed, as it were,
   in a crowded theater, they ought to live under the eye of God and of
   angels. Let them stand in awe of these witnesses, though they may be
   concealed from the view of all mortals. Dismissing the metaphor of
   darkness and light, he enjoins them to regulate their life
   circumspectly as wise men, [160] who have been educated by the Lord in
   the school of true wisdom. Our understanding must shew itself by taking
   God for our guide and instructor, to teach us his own will.

   16. Redeeming the time. By a consideration of the time he enforces his
   exhortation. The days are evil. Everything around us tends to corrupt
   and mislead; so that it is difficult for godly persons, who walk among
   so many thorns, to escape unhurt. Such corruption having infected the
   age, the devil appears to have obtained tyrannical sway; so that time
   cannot be dedicated to God without being in some way redeemed. And what
   shall be the price of its redemption? To withdraw from the endless
   variety of allurements which would easily lead us astray; to rid
   ourselves from the cares and pleasures of the world; and, in a word, to
   abandon every hinderance. Let us be eager to recover it in every
   possible way, and let the numerous offenses and arduous toil, which
   many are in the habit of alleging as an apology for indolence, serve
   rather to awaken our vigilance.

   17. Wherefore be ye not unwise. He whose

   "delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates in it day and
   night,"
   (Psalm 1:2,)

   will triumph over every obstacle which Satan can oppose to his
   progress. Whence comes it that some wander, others fall, others strike
   against a rock, others go away, -- but because we allow ourselves to be
   gradually blinded by Satan, and lose sight of the will of God, which we
   ought constantly to remember? And observe, that Paul defines wisdom to
   be, understanding what the will of the Lord is

   "How shall a young man," says David, "direct his way? By attending to
   thy word, O Lord." (Psalm 119:9.)

   He speaks of youths, but it is the same wisdom which belongs to old
   men.

   18. And be not drunk with wine. When he enjoins them not to be drunk,
   he forbids excessive and immoderate drinking of every description. "Be
   not intemperate in drinking."

   In which [161] is lasciviousness. The Greek word asotia, which is
   translated "lasciviousness," points out the evils which arise from
   drunkenness. I understand by it all that is implied in a wanton and
   dissolute life; for to translate it luxury, would quite enfeeble the
   sense. The meaning therefore is, that drunkards throw off quickly every
   restraint of modesty or shame; that where wine reigns, profligacy
   naturally follows; and consequently, that all who have any regard to
   moderation or decency ought to avoid and abhor drunkenness.

   The children of this world are accustomed to indulge in deep drinking
   as an excitement to mirth. Such carnal excitement is contrasted with
   that holy joy of which the Spirit of God is the Author, and which
   produces entirely opposite effects. To what does drunkenness lead? To
   unbounded licentiousness, -- to unbridled, indecent merriment. And to
   what does spiritual joy lead, when it is most strongly excited? [162]

   19. To psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs. These are truly pleasant
   and delightful fruits. The Spirit means "joy in the Holy Ghost,"
   (Romans 14:17;) and the exhortation, be ye filled, (ver. 18,) alludes
   to deep drinking, with which it is indirectly contrasted. Speaking to
   themselves, is speaking among themselves. Nor does he enjoin them to
   sing inwardly or alone; for he immediately adds, singing in your
   hearts; as if he had said, "Let your praises be not merely on the
   tongue, as hypocrites do, but from the heart." What may be the exact
   difference between psalms and hymns, or between hymns and songs, it is
   not easy to determine, though a few remarks on this subject shall be
   offered on a future occasion. [163] The appellation spiritual, given to
   these songs, is strikingly appropriate; for the songs most frequently
   used are almost always on trifling subjects, and very far from being
   chaste.

   20. Giving thanks always. He means that this is a pleasure which ought
   never to lose its relish; that this is an exercise of which we ought
   never to weary. Innumerable benefits which we receive from God yield
   fresh cause of joy and thanksgiving. At the same time, he reminds
   believers that it will argue ungodly and disgraceful sloth, if they
   shall not always give thanks, -- if their whole life shall not be spent
   in the study and exercise of praising God.

   Ephesians 5:21-27

   21. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

   21. Subditi estote invicem in timore Christi (vel, Dei.)

   22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

   22. Mulieres suis maritis subditae sint tanquam Domino;

   23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head
   of the church; and he is the savior of the body.

   23. Quoniam vir est caput uxoris, quemadmodum et Christus caput est
   Ecclesiae, qui idem est servator corporis.

   24. Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives
   be to their own husbands in every thing.

   24. Caeterum quemadmodum Ecclesia subest Christo, ita et mulieres suis
   maritis in omnibus.

   25. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
   and gave himself for it;

   25. Viri, diligite vestras uxores; quemadmodum et Christus dilexit
   Ecclesiam, et se ipsum tradidit pro ea,

   26. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
   the word;

   26. Ut eam sanctificaret, mundans lavacro aquae in Verbo;

   27. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
   spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and
   without blemish.

   27. Ut sisteret eam sibi gloriosam Ecclesiam, non habentem maculam, aut
   rugam, aut quicquam tale; sed ut esset sancta et irreprehensibilis.


   21. Submit yourselves. God has bound us so strongly to each other, that
   no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love reigns,
   mutual services will be rendered. I do not except even kings and
   governors, whose very authority is held for the service of the
   community. It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be
   subject to each other in their turn.

   But as nothing is more irksome to the mind of man than this mutual
   subjection, he directs us to the fear of Christ, who alone can subdue
   our fierceness, that we may not refuse the yoke, and can humble our
   pride, that we may not be ashamed of serving our neighbors. It does not
   much affect the sense, whether we interpret the fear of Christ,
   passively, thus, -- let us submit to our neighbors, because we fear
   Christ; or actively, -- let us submit to them, because the minds of all
   godly persons ought to be influenced by such fear under the reign of
   Christ. Some Greek manuscripts read, "the fear of God." The change may
   have been introduced by some person, who thought that the other phrase,
   the fear of Christ, though by far the most appropriate, sounded a
   little harsh. [164]

   22. Wives, submit yourselves. He comes now to the various conditions of
   life; for, besides the universal bond of subjection, some are more
   closely bound to each other, according to their respective callings.
   The community at large is divided, as it were, into so many yokes, out
   of which arises mutual obligation. There is, first, the yoke of
   marriage between husband and wife; -- secondly, the yoke which binds
   parents and children; -- and, thirdly, the yoke which connects masters
   and servants. By this arrangement there are six different classes, for
   each of whom Paul lays down peculiar duties. He begins with wives, whom
   he enjoins to be subject to their husbands, in the same manner as to
   Christ, -- as to the Lord. Not that the authority is equal, but wives
   cannot obey Christ without yielding obedience to their husbands.

   23. For the husband is the head of the wife. This is the reason
   assigned why wives should be obedient. Christ has appointed the same
   relation to exist between a husband and a wife, as between himself and
   his church. This comparison ought to produce a stronger impression on
   their minds, than the mere declaration that such is the appointment of
   God. Two things are here stated. God has given to the husband authority
   over the wife; and a resemblance of this authority is found in Christ,
   who is the head of the church, as the husband is of the wife.

   And he is the savior of the body. The pronoun HE (autos) is supposed by
   some to refer to Christ; and, by others, to the husband. It applies
   more naturally, in my opinion, to Christ, but still with a view to the
   present subject. In this point, as well as in others, the resemblance
   ought to hold. As Christ rules over his church for her salvation, so
   nothing yields more advantage or comfort to the wife than to be subject
   to her husband. To refuse that subjection, by means of which they might
   be saved, is to choose destruction.

   24. But, as the church is subject to Christ. The particle but, may lead
   some to believe that the words, he is the savior of the body, are
   intended to anticipate an objection. Christ has, no doubt, this
   peculiar claim, that he is the Savior of the Church: nevertheless, let
   wives know, that their husbands, though they cannot produce equal
   claims, have authority over them, after the example of Christ. I prefer
   the former interpretation; for the argument derived from the word but,
   (alla,) does not appear to me to have much weight.

   25. Husbands, love your wives. From husbands, on the other hand, the
   apostle requires that they cherish toward their wives no ordinary love;
   for to them, also, he holds out the example of Christ, -- even as
   Christ also loved the church. If they are honored to bear his image,
   and to be, in some measure, his representatives, they ought to resemble
   him also in the discharge of duty.

   And gave himself for it. This is intended to express the strong
   affection which husbands ought to have for their wives, though he takes
   occasion, immediately afterwards, to commend the grace of Christ. Let
   husbands imitate Christ in this respect, that he scrupled not to die
   for his church. One peculiar consequence, indeed, which resulted from
   his death, -- that by it he redeemed his church, -- is altogether
   beyond the power of men to imitate.

   26. That he might sanctify, -- or, that he might separate it to
   himself; for such I consider to be the meaning of the word sanctify
   This is accomplished by the forgiveness of sins, and the regeneration
   of the Spirit.

   Washing it with the washing of water. Having mentioned the inward and
   hidden sanctification, he now adds the outward symbol, by which it is
   visibly confirmed; as if he had said, that a pledge of that
   sanctification is held out to us by baptism. Here it is necessary to
   guard against unsound interpretation, lest the wicked superstition of
   men, as has frequently happened, change a sacrament into an idol. When
   Paul says that we are washed by baptism, his meaning is, that God
   employs it for declaring to us that we are washed, and at the same time
   performs what it represents. If the truth -- or, which is the same
   thing, the exhibition of the truth -- were not connected with baptism,
   it would be improper to say that baptism is the washing of the soul. At
   the same time, we must beware of ascribing to the sign, or to the
   minister, what belongs to God alone. We must not imagine that washing
   is performed by the minister, or that water cleanses the pollutions of
   the soul, which nothing but the blood of Christ can accomplish. In
   short, we must beware of giving any portion of our confidence to the
   element or to man; for the true and proper use of the sacrament is to
   lead us directly to Christ, and to place all our dependence upon him.

   Others again suppose that too much importance is given to the sign, by
   saying that baptism is the washing of the soul. Under the influence of
   this fear, they labor exceedingly to lessen the force of the eulogium
   which is here pronounced on baptism. But they are manifestly wrong;
   for, in the first place, the apostle does not say that it is the sign
   which washes, but declares it to be exclusively the work of God. It is
   God who washes, and the honor of performing it cannot lawfully be taken
   from its Author and given to the sign. But there is no absurdity in
   saying that God employs a sign as the outward means. Not that the power
   of God is limited by the sign, but this assistance is accommodated to
   the weakness of our capacity. Some are offended at this view, imagining
   that it takes from the Holy Spirit a work which is peculiarly his own,
   and which is everywhere ascribed to him in Scripture. But they are
   mistaken; for God acts by the sign in such a manner, that its whole
   efficacy depends upon his Spirit. Nothing more is attributed to the
   sign than to be an inferior organ, utterly useless in itself, except so
   far as it derives its power from another source.

   Equally groundless is their fear, that by this interpretation the
   freedom of God will be restrained. The grace of God is not confined to
   the sign; so that God may not, if he pleases, bestow it without the aid
   of the sign. Besides, many receive the sign who are not made partakers
   of grace; for the sign is common to all, to the good and to the bad
   alike; but the Spirit is bestowed on none but the elect, and the sign,
   as we have said, has no efficacy without the Spirit. The Greek
   participle katharisas, is in the past tense, as if he had said, "After
   having washed." But, as the Latin language has no active participle in
   the past tense, I chose rather to disregard this, and to translate it
   (mundans) washing, instead of (mundatam) having been washed; which
   would have kept out of view a matter of far greater importance, namely,
   that to God alone belongs the work of cleansing.

   In the word. [165] This is very far from being a superfluous addition;
   for, if the word is taken away, the whole power of the sacraments is
   gone. What else are the sacraments but seals of the word? This single
   consideration will drive away superstition. How comes it that
   superstitious men are confounded by signs, but because their minds are
   not directed to the Word, which would lead them to God? Certainly, when
   we look to anything else than to the word, there is nothing sound,
   nothing pure; but one absurdity springs out of another, till at length
   the signs, which were appointed by God for the salvation of men, become
   profane, and degenerate into gross idolatry. The only difference,
   therefore, between the sacraments of the godly and the contrivances of
   unbelievers, is found in the Word.

   By the Word is here meant the promise, which explains the value and use
   of the signs. Hence it appears, that the Papists do not at all observe
   the signs in a proper manner. They boast indeed, of having "the Word,"
   but appear to regard it as a sort of enchantment; for they mutter it in
   an unknown tongue; as if it were addressed to dead matter, and not to
   men. No explanation of the mystery is made to the people; and in this
   respect, were there no other, the sacrament begins to be nothing more
   than the dead element of water. In the word is equivalent to "By the
   word."

   27. That he might present it to himself. He declares what is the design
   of baptism and of our being washed. It is, that we may live in a holy
   and unblamable manner before God. We are washed by Christ, not that we
   may return to our pollution, but that we may retain through our life
   the purity which we have once received. This is described in
   metaphorical language appropriate to his argument.

   Not having spot or wrinkle. As the beauty of the wife produces love in
   the husband, so Christ adorns the Church his bride with holiness as a
   proof of his regard. This metaphor contains an allusion to marriage;
   but he afterwards lays aside the figure, and says plainly, that Christ
   has reconciled the church, that it might be holy and without blemish.
   The true beauty of the church consists in this conjugal chastity, that
   is, in holiness and purity.

   The word present (parastesHu) implies that the church ought to be holy,
   not only in the view of men, but in the eyes of the Lord; for Paul
   says, that he might present it to himself, not that he might shew it to
   others, though the fruits of that hidden purity become afterwards
   evident in outward works. Pelagians were wont to quote this passage in
   order to prove the perfection of righteousness in this life, but have
   been successfully answered by Augustine. Paul does not state what has
   been done, but for what purpose Christ has cleansed his church. Now,
   when a thing is said to be done that another may afterwards follow, it
   is idle to conclude that this latter thing, which ought to follow, has
   been already done. We do not deny that the holiness of the church is
   already begun; but, so long as there is daily progress, there cannot be
   perfection.

   Ephesians 5:28-33

   28. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that
   loveth his wife loveth himself.

   28. Ita viri debent diligere suas uxores, tanquam sua corpora. Qui
   diligit uxorem suam, se ipsum diligit.

   29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
   cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

   29. Nemo enim unquam carnem suam odio habuit, sed nutrit et fovet eam;
   quemadmodum et Christus Ecclesiam.

   30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

   30. Quia membra sumus corporis ejus, ex ejus carne et ex ejus ossibus.

   31. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
   be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

   31. Hujus causa relinquet homo patrem et matrem suam, et adhaerebit
   uxori suae; et erunt duo in carnem unam. (Genesis 2:24.)

   32. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
   church.

   32. Arcanum hoc magnum est; ego autem dico in Christo et in Ecclesia.

   33. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife
   even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

   33. Caeterum vos quoque singuli, suam quisque uxorem diligat; mulier
   autem timeat maritum.


   28. He that loveth his wife. An argument is now drawn from nature
   itself, to prove that men ought to love their wives. Every man, by his
   very nature, loves himself. But no man can love himself without loving
   his wife. Therefore, the man who does not love his wife is a monster.
   The minor proposition is proved in this manner. Marriage was appointed
   by God on the condition that the two should be one flesh; and that this
   unity may be the more sacred, he again recommends it to our notice by
   the consideration of Christ and his church. Such is the amount of his
   argument, which to a certain extent applies universally to human
   society. To shew what man owes to man, Isaiah says, "hide not thyself
   from thine own flesh." (Isaiah 58:7.) But this refers to our common
   nature. Between a man and his wife there is a far closer relation; for
   they not only are united by a resemblance of nature, but by the bond of
   marriage have become one man. Whoever considers seriously the design of
   marriage cannot but love his wife.

   29. Even as Christ the church. He proceeds to enforce the obligations
   of marriage by representing to us Christ and his Church; for a more
   powerful example could not have been adduced. The strong affection
   which a husband ought to cherish towards his wife is exemplified by
   Christ, and an instance of that unity which belongs to marriage is
   declared to exist between himself and the Church. This is a remarkable
   passage on the mysterious intercourse which we have with Christ.

   30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
   First, this is no exaggeration, but the simple truth. Secondly, he does
   not simply mean that Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses
   something higher (kai emphatikoteron) and more emphatic.

   31. For this cause. This is an exact quotation from the writings of
   Moses. (Genesis 2:24.) And what does it mean? As Eve was formed out of
   the substance of her husband, and thus was a part of himself; so, if we
   are the true members of Christ, we share his substance, and by this
   intercourse unite into one body. In short, Paul describes our union to
   Christ, a symbol and pledge of which is given to us in the ordinance of
   the supper. Those who talk about the torture exercised on this passage
   to make it refer to the Lord's supper, while no mention is made of the
   supper, but of marriage, are egregiously mistaken. When they admit that
   the death of Christ is commemorated in the supper, but not that such
   intercourse exists as we assert from the words of Christ, we quote this
   passage against them. Paul says that we are members of his flesh and of
   his bones. Do we wonder then, that in the Lord's supper he holds out
   his body to be enjoyed by us, and to nourish us unto eternal life? Thus
   we prove that the only union which we maintain to be represented by the
   Lord's supper is here declared in its truth and consequences by the
   apostle.

   Two subjects are exhibited together; for the spiritual union between
   Christ and his church is so treated as to illustrate the common law of
   marriage, to which the quotation from Moses relates. He immediately
   adds, that the saying is fulfilled in Christ and the church. Every
   opportunity which presents itself for proclaiming our obligations to
   Christ is readily embraced, but he adapts his illustration of them to
   the present subject. It is uncertain whether Moses introduces Adam as
   using these words, or gives them as an inference drawn by himself from
   the creation of man. Nor is it of much consequence which of these views
   be taken; for, in either case, we must hold it to be an announcement of
   the will of God, enjoining the duties which men owe to their wives.

   He shall leave his father and mother. As if he had said, "Let him
   rather leave his father and mother than not cleave to his wife." The
   marriage bond does not set aside the other duties of mankind, nor are
   the commandments of God so inconsistent with each other, that a man
   cannot be a good and faithful husband without ceasing to be a dutiful
   son. It is altogether a question of degree. Moses draws the comparison,
   in order to express more strongly the close and sacred union which
   subsists between husband and wife. A son is bound by an inviolable law
   of nature to perform his duties towards his father; and when the
   obligations of a husband towards his wife are declared to be stronger,
   their force is the better understood. He who resolves to be a good
   husband will not fail to perform his filial duties, but will regard
   marriage as more sacred than all other ties.

   And they two shall be one flesh. They shall be one man, or, to use a
   common phrase, they shall constitute one person; which certainly would
   not hold true with regard to any other kind of relationship. All
   depends on this, that the wife was formed of the flesh and bones of her
   husband. Such is the union between us and Christ, who in some sort
   makes us partakers of his substance. "We are bone of his bone, and
   flesh of his flesh," (Genesis 2:23;) not because, like ourselves, he
   has a human nature, but because, by the power of his Spirit, he makes
   us a part of his body, so that from him we derive our life.

   32. This is a great mystery. He concludes by expressing his
   astonishment at the spiritual union between Christ and the church. This
   is a great mystery; by which he means, that no language can explain
   fully what it implies. It is to no purpose that men fret themselves to
   comprehend, by the judgment of the flesh, the manner and character of
   this union; for here the infinite power of the Divine Spirit is
   exerted. Those who refuse to admit anything on this subject beyond what
   their own capacity can reach, act an exceedingly foolish part. We tell
   them that the flesh and blood of Christ are exhibited to us in the
   Lord's supper. "Explain to us the manner," they reply, "or you will not
   convince us." For my own part, I am overwhelmed by the depth of this
   mystery, and am not ashamed to join Paul in acknowledging at once my
   ignorance and my admiration. How much more satisfactory would this be
   than to follow my carnal judgment, in undervaluing what Paul declares
   to be a deep mystery! Reason itself teaches how we ought to act in such
   matters; for whatever is supernatural is clearly beyond our own
   comprehension. Let us therefore labor more to feel Christ living in us,
   than to discover the nature of that intercourse.

   We cannot avoid admiring the acuteness of the Papists, who conclude
   from the word mystery (musterion) that marriage is one of seven
   sacraments, as if they had the power of changing water into wine. They
   enumerate seven sacraments, while Christ has instituted no more than
   two; and, to prove that matrimony is one of the seven, they produce
   this passage. On what ground? Because the Vulgate has adopted the word
   Sacrament (sacramentum) as a translation of the word Mystery, which the
   apostle uses. As if Sacrament (sacramentum) did not frequently, among
   Latin writers, denote Mystery, or as if Mystery had not been the word
   employed by Paul in the same Epistle, when speaking of the calling of
   the Gentiles. But the present question is, Has marriage been appointed
   as a sacred symbol of the grace of God, to declare and represent to us
   something spiritual, such as Baptism or the Lord's Supper? They have no
   ground for such an assertion, unless it be that they have been deceived
   by the doubtful signification of a Latin word, or rather by their
   ignorance of the Greek language. If the simple fact had been observed,
   that the word used by Paul is Mystery, no mistake would ever have
   occurred.

   We see then the hammer and anvil with which they fabricated this
   sacrament. But they have given another proof of their indolence in not
   attending to the correction which is immediately added,

   But I speak concerning Christ and the church. He intended to give
   express warning that no man should understand him as speaking of
   marriage; so that his meaning is more fully expressed than if he had
   uttered the former sentiment without any exception. The great mystery
   is, that Christ breathes into the church his own life and power. But
   who would discover here anything like a sacrament? This blunder arose
   from the grossest ignorance.

   33. Nevertheless, let every one. Having digressed a little from this
   subject, though the very digression aided his design, he adopts the
   method usually followed in short precepts, by giving a brief summary of
   duties. Husbands are required to love their wives, and wives to fear
   (phobotai) their husbands, understanding by fear that reverence which
   will lead them to be submissive. Where reverence does not exist, there
   will be no willing subjection. [166]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [166] "One peculiarity in this injunction has been usually overlooked.
   What is instructive on either side is not enforced, but what is
   necessary to direct and hallow such an instinct is inculcated. The
   woman loves in deep, undying sympathy; but, to teach her how this
   fondness should know and fill its appropriate sphere, she is commanded
   to obey and honor. The man, on the other hand, feels that his position
   is to govern; but, to shew him what should be the essence and means of
   his government, he is enjoined to love." -- Eadie.

   CHAPTER 6
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ephesians 6:1-4

   1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

   1. Filii, obedite parentibus vestris in Domino; hoc enim est justum.

   2. Honor thy father and mother, (which is the first commandment with
   promise,)

   2. Honora patrem tuum et matrem; (quod est mandatum primum cum
   promissione:)

   3. That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
   earth.

   3. Ut bene tibi sit, et sis longaevus super terram.

   4. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them
   up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

   4. Vos etiam, patres, ne ad iram provocetis filios vestros; sed educate
   eos in disciplina et correptione Domini.


   1. Children, obey. Why does the apostle use the word obey instead of
   honor, [167] which has a greater extent of meaning? It is because
   Obedience is the evidence of that honor which children owe to their
   parents, and is therefore more earnestly enforced. It is likewise more
   difficult; for the human mind recoils from the idea of subjection, and
   with difficulty allows itself to be placed under the control of
   another. Experience shews how rare this virtue is; for do we find one
   among a thousand that is obedient to his parents? By a figure of
   speech, a part is here put for the whole, but it is the most important
   part, and is necessarily accompanied by all the others.

   In the Lord. Besides the law of nature, which is acknowledged by all
   nations, the obedience of children is enforced by the authority of God.
   Hence it follows, that parents are to be obeyed, so far only as is
   consistent with piety to God, which comes first in order. If the
   command of God is the rule by which the submission of children is to be
   regulated, it would be foolish to suppose that the performance of this
   duty could lead away from God himself.

   For this is right. This is added in order to restrain the fierceness
   which, we have already said, appears to be natural to almost all men.
   He proves it to be right, because God has commanded it; for we are not
   at liberty to dispute, or call in question, the appointment of him
   whose will is the unerring rule of goodness and righteousness. That
   honor should be represented as including obedience is not surprising;
   for mere ceremony is of no value in the sight of God. The precept,
   honor thy father and mother, comprehends all the duties by which the
   sincere affection and respect of children to their parents can be
   expressed.

   2. Which is the first commandment with promise. The promises annexed to
   the commandments are intended to excite our hopes, and to impart a
   greater cheerfulness to our obedience; and therefore Paul uses this as
   a kind of seasoning to render the submission, which he enjoins on
   children, more pleasant and agreeable. He does not merely say, that God
   has offered a reward to him who obeys his father and mother, but that
   such an offer is peculiar to this commandment. If each of the
   commandments had its own promises, there would have been no ground for
   the commendation bestowed in the present instance. But this is the
   first commandment, Paul tells us, which God has been pleased, as it
   were, to seal by a remarkable promise. There is some difficulty here;
   for the second commandment likewise contains a promise,

   "I am the Lord thy God, who shew mercy unto thousands of them that love
   me, and keep my commandments."
   (Exodus 20:5,6.)

   But this is universal, applying indiscriminately to the whole law, and
   cannot be said to be annexed to that commandment. Paul's assertion
   still holds true, that no other commandment but that which enjoins the
   obedience due by children to their parents is distinguished by a
   promise.

   3. That it may be well with thee. The promise is -- a long life; from
   which we are led to understand that the present life is not to be
   overlooked among the gifts of God. On this and other kindred subjects I
   must refer my reader to the Institutes of the Christian Religion; [168]
   satisfying myself at present with saying, in a few words, that the
   reward promised to the obedience of children is highly appropriate.
   Those who shew kindness to their parents from whom they derived life,
   are assured by God, that in this life it will be well with them.

   And that thou mayest live long on the earth. Moses expressly mentions
   the land of Canaan,

   "that thy days may be long upon the land which
   the Lord thy God giveth thee." (Exodus 20:12.)

   Beyond this the Jews could not conceive of any life more happy or
   desirable. But as the same divine blessing is extended to the whole
   world, Paul has properly left out the mention of a place, the peculiar
   distinction of which lasted only till the coming of Christ.

   4. And, ye fathers. Parents, on the other hand, are exhorted not to
   irritate their children by unreasonable severity. This would excite
   hatred, and would lead them to throw off the yoke altogether.
   Accordingly, in writing to the Colossians, he adds, "lest they be
   discouraged." (Colossians 3:21.) Kind and liberal treatment has rather
   a tendency to cherish reverence for their parents, and to increase the
   cheerfulness and activity of their obedience, while a harsh and unkind
   manner rouses them to obstinacy, and destroys the natural affections.
   But Paul goes on to say, "let them be fondly cherished;" for the Greek
   word, (ektrephete,) which is translated bring up, unquestionably
   conveys the idea of gentleness and forbearance. To guard them, however,
   against the opposite and frequent evil of excessive indulgence, he
   again draws the rein which he had slackened, and adds, in the
   instruction and reproof of the Lord. It is not the will of God that
   parents, in the exercise of kindness, shall spare and corrupt their
   children. Let their conduct towards their children be at once mild and
   considerate, so as to guide them in the fear of the Lord, and correct
   them also when they go astray. That age is so apt to become wanton,
   that it requires frequent admonition and restraint.

   [167] "Timan properly signifies, to perform one's duty to any one;' and
   here reverence must comprehend the cognate offices of affection, care,
   and support. The same complexity of sense is observable in the

   Bloomfield.

   Ephesians 6:5-9

   5. Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the
   flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
   Christ;

   5. Servi, obedite dominis secundum carnem, cum timore et tremore in
   simplicitate cordis vestri, tanquam Christo;

   6. Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of
   Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

   6. Non quasi ad oculum servientes, tanquam hominibus studentes placere,
   sed tanquam servi Christi, facientes voluntatem Dei ex animo,

   7. With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

   7. Cum benevolentia, servientes Domino, et non hominibus;

   8. Knowing, that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he
   receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

   8. Scientes quod unusquisque quicquid boni fecerit, recipiet a Domino,
   sive servus, sive liber.

   9. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
   threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is
   there respect of persons with him.

   9. Et vos, domini, mutuum officium praestate erga illos, remittentes
   minas; scientes quod illorum et vester Dominus est in coelis; et non
   est apud eum personarum acceptio.


   5. Servants, be obedient. His exhortation to servants is so much the
   more earnest, on account of the hardship and bitterness of their
   condition, which renders it more difficult to be endured. And he does
   not speak merely of outward obedience, but says more about fear
   willingly rendered; for it is a very rare occurrence to find one who
   willingly yields himself to the control of another. The servants
   (douloi) whom he immediately addresses were not hired servants, like
   those of the present day, but slaves, such as were in ancient times,
   whose slavery was perpetual, unless, through the favor of their
   masters, they obtained freedom, -- whom their masters bought with
   money, that they might impose upon them the most degrading employments,
   and might, with the full protection of the law, exercise over them the
   power of life and death. To such he says, obey your masters, lest they
   should vainly imagine that carnal freedom had been procured for them by
   the gospel.

   But as some of the worst men were compelled by the dread of punishment,
   he distinguishes between Christian and ungodly servants, by the
   feelings which they cherished. With fear and trembling; that is, with
   the careful respect which springs from an honest purpose. It can hardly
   be expected, however, that so much deference will be paid to a mere
   man, unless a higher authority shall enforce the obligation; and
   therefore he adds, as doing the will of God. (Ver. 6.) Hence it
   follows, that it is not enough if their obedience satisfy the eyes of
   men; for God requires truth and sincerity of heart. When they serve
   their masters faithfully, they obey God. As if he had said, "Do not
   suppose that by the judgment of men you were thrown into slavery. It is
   God who has laid upon you this burden, who has placed you in the power
   of your masters. He who conscientiously endeavors to render what he
   owes to his master, performs his duty not to man only, but to God."

   With good will doing service. (Ver. 7.) This is contrasted with the
   suppressed indignation which swells the bosom of slaves. Though they
   dare not openly break out or give signs of obstinacy, their dislike of
   the authority exercised over them is so strong, that it is with the
   greatest unwillingness and reluctance that they obey their masters.

   Whoever reads the accounts of the dispositions and conduct of slaves,
   which are scattered through the writings of the ancients, will be at no
   loss to perceive that the number of injunctions here given does not
   exceed that of the diseases which prevailed among this class, and which
   it was of importance to cure. But the same instruction applies to male
   and female servants of our own times. It is God who appoints and
   regulates all the arrangements of society. As the condition of servants
   is much more agreeable than that of slaves in ancient times, they ought
   to consider themselves far less excusable, if they do not endeavor, in
   every way, to comply with Paul's injunctions.

   Masters according to the flesh. (Ver. 5.) This expression is used to
   soften the harsh aspect of slavery. He reminds them that their
   spiritual freedom, which was by far the most desirable, remained
   untouched.

   Eye-service (ophthalmodouleia) is mentioned; because almost all
   servants are addicted to flattery, but, as soon as their master's back
   is turned, indulge freely in contempt, or perhaps in ridicule. Paul
   therefore enjoins godly persons to keep at the greatest distance from
   such deceitful pretences.

   8. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth. What a powerful
   consolation! However unworthy, however ungrateful or cruel, their
   masters may be, God will accept their services as rendered to himself.
   When servants take into account the pride and arrogance of their
   masters, they often become more indolent from the thought that their
   labor is thrown away. But Paul informs them that their reward is laid
   up with God for services which appear to be ill bestowed on unfeeling
   men; and that there is no reason, therefore, why they should be led
   aside from the path of duty. He adds, whether bond or free No
   distinction is made between a slave and a free man. The world is wont
   to set little value on the labors of slaves; but God esteems them as
   highly as the duties of kings. In his estimate, the outward station is
   thrown aside, and each is judged according to the uprightness of his
   heart.

   9. And ye masters. In the treatment of their slaves, the laws granted
   to masters a vast amount of power. Whatever had thus been sanctioned by
   the civil code was regarded by many as in itself lawful. To such an
   extent did their cruelty in some instances proceed, that the Roman
   emperors were forced to restrain their tyranny. But though no royal
   edicts had ever been issued for the protection of slaves, God allows to
   masters no power over them beyond what is consistent with the law of
   love. When philosophers attempt to give to the principles of equity
   their full effect in restraining the excess of severity to slaves, they
   inculcate that masters ought to treat them in the same manner as hired
   servants. But they never look beyond utility; and, in judging even of
   that, they inquire only what is advantageous to the head of the family,
   or conducive to good order. The Apostle proceeds on a very different
   principle. He lays down what is lawful according to the Divine
   appointment, and how far they, too, are debtors to their servants.

   Do the same things to them. "Perform the duty which on your part you
   owe to them." What he calls in another Epistle, (to dikaion kai ten
   isoteta) that which is just and equal, [169] is precisely what, in this
   passage, he calls the same things, (ta auta.) And what is this but the
   law of analogy? Masters and servants are not indeed on the same level;
   but there is a mutual law which binds them. By this law, servants are
   placed under the authority of their masters; and, by the same law, due
   regard being had to the difference of their station, masters lie under
   certain obligations to their servants. This analogy is greatly
   misunderstood; because men do not try it by the law of love, which is
   the only true standard. Such is the import of Paul's phrase, the same
   things; for we are all ready enough to demand what is due to ourselves;
   but, when our own duty comes to be performed, every one attempts to
   plead exemption. It is chiefly, however, among persons of authority and
   rank that injustice of this sort prevails.

   Forbearing threatenings. Every expression of disdain, arising from the
   pride of masters, is included in the single word, threatenings. They
   are charged not to assume a lordly air or a terrific attitude, as if
   they were constantly threatening some evil against their servants, when
   they have occasion to address them. Threatenings, and every kind of
   barbarity, originate in this, that masters look upon their servants as
   if they had been born for their sake alone, and treat them as if they
   were of no more value than cattle. Under this one description, Paul
   forbids every kind of disdainful and barbarous treatment.

   Their Master and yours. A very necessary warning. What is there which
   we will not dare to attempt against our inferiors, if they have no
   ability to resist, and no means of obtaining redress, -- if no avenger,
   no protector appears, none who will be moved by compassion to listen to
   their complaints? It happens here, in short, according to the common
   proverb, that Impunity is the mother of Licentiousness. But Paul here
   reminds them, that, while masters possess authority over their
   servants, they have themselves the same Master in heaven, to whom they
   must render an account.

   And there is no respect of persons with him. A regard to persons blinds
   our eyes, so as to leave no room for law or justice; but Paul affirms
   that it is of no value in the sight of God. By person is meant anything
   about a man which does not belong to the real question, and which we
   take into account in forming a judgment. Relationship, beauty, rank,
   wealth, friendship, and everything of this sort, gain our favor; while
   the opposite qualities produce contempt and sometimes hatred. As those
   absurd feelings arising from the sight of a person have the greatest
   possible influence on human judgments, those who are invested with
   power are apt to flatter themselves, as if God would countenance such
   corruptions. "Who is he that God should regard him, or defend his
   interest against mine?" Paul, on the contrary, informs masters that
   they are mistaken if they suppose that their servants will be of little
   or no account before God, because they are so before men. "God is no
   respecter of persons," (Acts 10:34,) and the cause of the meanest man
   will not be a whit less regarded by him than that of the loftiest
   monarch.

   12. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
   principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
   this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places

   12. Quia non est nobis lucta adversus carnem et sanguinem, sed adversus
   principatus, adversus potestates, adversus mundanos principes
   tenebrarum saeculi hujus, adversus spirituales malitias in coelestibus.

   13. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able
   to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

   13. Quapropter assumite totam armaturam Dei, ut possitis resistere in
   die malo, et omnibus peractis stare.


   10. Finally. Resuming his general exhortations, he again enjoins them
   to be strong, -- to summon up courage and vigor; for there is always
   much to enfeeble us, and we are ill fitted to resist. But when our
   weakness is considered, an exhortation like this would have no effect,
   unless the Lord were present, and stretched out his hand to render
   assistance, or rather, unless he supplied us with all the power. Paul
   therefore adds, in the Lord. As if he had said, "You have no right to
   reply, that you have not the ability; for all that I require of you is,
   be strong in the Lord." To explain his meaning more fully, he adds, in
   the power of his might, which tends greatly to increase our confidence,
   particularly as it shews the remarkable assistance which God usually
   bestows upon believers. If the Lord aids us by his mighty power, we
   have no reason to shrink from the combat. But it will be asked, What
   purpose did it serve to enjoin the Ephesians to be strong in the Lord's
   mighty power, which they could not of themselves accomplish? I answer,
   there are two clauses here which must be considered. He exhorts them to
   be courageous, but at the same time reminds them to ask from God a
   supply of their own deficiencies, and promises that, in answer to their
   prayers, the power of God will be displayed.

   11. Put on the whole armor. God has furnished us with various defensive
   weapons, provided we do not indolently refuse what is offered. But we
   are almost all chargeable with carelessness and hesitation in using the
   offered grace; just as if a soldier, about to meet the enemy, should
   take his helmet, and neglect his shield. To correct this security, or,
   we should rather say, this indolence, Paul borrows a comparison from
   the military art, and bids us put on the whole armor of God. We ought
   to be prepared on all sides, so as to want nothing. The Lord offers to
   us arms for repelling every kind of attack. It remains for us to apply
   them to use, and not leave them hanging on the wall. To quicken our
   vigilance, he reminds us that we must not only engage in open warfare,
   but that we have a crafty and insidious foe to encounter, who
   frequently lies in ambush; for such is the import of the apostle's
   phrase, THE WILES [170] (tas methodeias) of the devil

   12. For we wrestle [171] not. To impress them still more deeply with
   their danger, he points out the nature of the enemy, which he
   illustrates by a comparative statement, Not against flesh and blood.
   The meaning is, that our difficulties are far greater than if we had to
   fight with men. There we resist human strength, sword is opposed to
   sword, man contends with man, force is met by force, and skill by
   skill; but here the case is widely different. All amounts to this, that
   our enemies are such as no human power can withstand. By flesh and
   blood the apostle denotes men, who are so denominated in order to
   contrast them with spiritual assailants. This is no bodily struggle.

   Let us remember this when the injurious treatment of others provokes us
   to revenge. Our natural disposition would lead us to direct all our
   exertions against the men themselves; but this foolish desire will be
   restrained by the consideration that the men who annoy us are nothing
   more than darts thrown by the hand of Satan. While we are employed in
   destroying those darts, we lay ourselves open to be wounded on all
   sides. To wrestle with flesh and blood will not only be useless, but
   highly pernicious. We must go straight to the enemy, who attacks and
   wounds us from his concealment, -- who slays before he appears.

   But to return to Paul. He describes our enemy as formidable, not to
   overwhelm us with fear, but to quicken our diligence and earnestness;
   for there is a middle course to be observed. When the enemy is
   neglected, he does his utmost to oppress us with sloth, and afterwards
   disarms us by terror; so that, ere the engagement has commenced, we are
   vanquished. By speaking of the power of the enemy, Paul labors to keep
   us more on the alert. He had already called him the devil, but now
   employs a variety of epithets, to make the reader understand that this
   is not an enemy who may be safely despised.

   Against principalities, against powers. Still, his object in producing
   alarm is not to fill us with dismay, but to excite us to caution. He
   calls them kosmokratoras, that is, princes of the world; but he
   explains himself more fully by adding -- of the darkness of the world.
   The devil reigns in the world, because the world is nothing else than
   darkness. Hence it follows, that the corruption of the world gives way
   to the kingdom of the devil; for he could not reside in a pure and
   upright creature of God, but all arises from the sinfulness of men. By
   darkness, it is almost unnecessary to say, are meant unbelief and
   ignorance of God, with the consequences to which they lead. As the
   whole world is covered with darkness, the devil is called "the prince
   of this world." (John 14:30.)

   By calling it wickedness, he denotes the malignity and cruelty of the
   devil, and, at the same time, reminds us that the utmost caution is
   necessary to prevent him from gaining an advantage. For the same
   reason, the epithet spiritual is applied; for, when the enemy is
   invisible, our danger is greater. There is emphasis, too, in the
   phrase, in heavenly places; for the elevated station from which the
   attack is made gives us greater trouble and difficulty.

   An argument drawn from this passage by the Manicheans, to support their
   wild notion of two principles, is easily refuted. They supposed the
   devil to be (antitheon) an antagonist deity, whom the righteous God
   would not subdue without great exertion. For Paul does not ascribe to
   devils a principality, which they seize without the consent, and
   maintain in spite of the opposition, of the Divine Being, -- but a
   principality which, as Scripture everywhere asserts, God, in righteous
   judgment, yields to them over the wicked. The inquiry is, not what
   power they have in opposition to God, but how far they ought to excite
   our alarm, and keep us on our guard. Nor is any countenance here given
   to the belief, that the devil has formed, and keeps for himself, the
   middle region of the air. Paul does not assign to them a fixed
   territory, which they can call their own, but merely intimates that
   they are engaged in hostility, and occupy an elevated station.

   13. Wherefore take unto you. Though our enemy is so powerful, Paul does
   not infer that we must throw away our spears, but that we must prepare
   our minds for the battle. A promise of victory is, indeed, involved in
   the exhortation, that ye may be able. If we only put on the whole armor
   of God, and fight valiantly to the end, we shall certainly stand. On
   any other supposition, we would be discouraged by the number and
   variety of the contests; and therefore he adds, in the evil day. By
   this expression he rouses them from security, bids them prepare
   themselves for hard, painful, and dangerous conflicts, and, at the same
   time, animates them with the hope of victory; for amidst the greatest
   dangers they will be safe. And having done all. They are thus directed
   to cherish confidence through the whole course of life. There will be
   no danger which may not be successfully met by the power of God; nor
   will any who, with this assistance, fight against Satan, fail in the
   day of battle.

   [170] "Plutarch tells us, (Symp. l. 2., page 638,) that wrestling was
   the most artful and subtle of all the ancient games, and that the name
   of it (pale) was derived from a word, which signifies to throw a man
   down by deceit and craft. And it is certain that persons who understand
   this exercise have many fetches, and turns, and changes of posture,
   which they make use of to supplant and trip up their adversaries. And
   it is with great justice, that a state of persecution is compared with
   it; since many are the arts, arising from the terrors of worldly evil
   on the one hand, and the natural love which men have to life, liberty,
   plenty, and the pleasures of life, on the other, that the devil makes
   use of to circumvent and foil them." -- Chandler.

   [171] "Pale is properly a gymnastic term; but the Apostle often unites
   military with agonistic metaphors; and here the agonistic is not less
   suitable than the military. So in a similar passage of Max. Tyr. Diss.
   Version 9, volume 1 page 79, ed. Reisk, we have mention of Socrates
   wrestling with Melitus, with bonds and poison; next, the philosopher
   Plato wrestling with a tyrant's anger, a rough sea, and the greatest
   dangers; then, Xenophon struggling with the prejudices of Tissaphernes,
   the snares of Ariaeus, the treachery of Meno, and royal machinations;
   and, lastly, Diogenes struggling with adversaries even more formidable,
   namely, poverty, infamy, hunger, and cold." -- Bloomfield.

   Ephesians 6:14-20

   14. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
   having on the breastplate of righteousness;

   14. State igitur succincti lumbos veritate, et induti thoracem
   justitiae,

   15. And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

   15. Et calceati pedes praeparatione evangelii pacis;

   16. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able
   to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

   16. In omnibus assumpto scuto fidei, quo possitis omnia tela maligni
   ignita exstinguere.

   17. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
   which is the word of God:

   17. Et galeam salutaris accipite, et gladium Spiritus, qui est verbum
   Dei;

   18. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
   watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
   saints;

   18. Per omnem precationem et orationem omni tempore precantes in
   Spiritu, et in hoc ipsum vigilantes, cum omni assiduitate et
   deprecatione pro omnibus sanctis;

   19. And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my
   mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

   19. Et pro me, ut mihi detur sermo in apertione oris mei cum fiducia,
   ut patefaciam mysterium evangelii;

   20. For which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak
   boldly, as I ought to speak.

   20. Pro quo legatione fungor in catena; ut confidenter me geram in eo,
   quemadmodum oportet me loqui.


   14. Stand therefore. Now follows a description of the arms which they
   were enjoined to wear. We must not, however, inquire very minutely into
   the meaning of each word; for an allusion to military customs is all
   that was intended. Nothing can be more idle than the extraordinary
   pains which some have taken to discover the reason why righteousness is
   made a breastplate, instead of a girdle. Paul's design was to touch
   briefly on the most important points required in a Christian, and to
   adapt them to the comparison which he had already used.

   Truth, which means sincerity of mind, is compared to a girdle. Now, a
   girdle was, in ancient times, one of the most important parts of
   military armor. Our attention is thus directed to the fountain of
   sincerity; for the purity of the gospel ought to remove from our minds
   all guile, and from our hearts all hypocrisy. Secondly, he recommends
   righteousness, and desires that it should be a breastplate for
   protecting the breast. Some imagine that this refers to a freely
   bestowed righteousness, or the imputation of righteousness, by which
   pardon of sin is obtained. But such matters ought not, I think, to have
   been mentioned on the present occasion; for the subject now under
   discussion is a blameless life. He enjoins us to be adorned, first,
   with integrity, and next with a devout and holy life.

   15. And your feet shod. The allusion, if I mistake not, is to the
   military greaves; for they were always reckoned a part of the armor,
   and were even used for domestic purposes. As soldiers covered their
   legs and feet to protect them against cold and other injuries, so we
   must be shod with the gospel, if we would pass unhurt through the
   world. It is the gospel of peace, and it is so called, as every reader
   must perceive, from its effects; for it is the message of our
   reconciliation to God, and nothing else gives peace to the conscience.
   But what is the meaning of the word preparation? Some explain it as an
   injunction to be prepared for the gospel; but it is the effect of the
   gospel which I consider to be likewise expressed by this term. We are
   enjoined to lay aside every hinderance, and to be prepared both for
   journey and for war. By nature we dislike exertion, and want agility. A
   rough road and many other obstacles retard our progress, and we are
   discouraged by the smallest annoyance. On these accounts, Paul holds
   out the gospel as the fittest means for undertaking and performing the
   expedition. Erasmus proposes a circumlocution, (ut sitis parati,) that
   ye may be prepared; but this does not appear to convey the true
   meaning.

   16. Taking the shield of faith. Though faith and the word of God are
   one, yet Paul assigns to them two distinct offices. I call them one,
   because the word is the object of faith, and cannot be applied to our
   use but by faith; as faith again is nothing, and can do nothing,
   without the word. But Paul, neglecting so subtle a distinction, allowed
   himself to expatiate at large on the military armor. In the first
   Epistle to the Thessalonians he gives both to faith and to love the
   name of a breastplate, -- "putting on the breastplate of faith and
   love," (1 Thessalonians 5:8.) All that was intended, therefore, was
   obviously this, -- "He who possesses the excellencies of character
   which are here described is protected on every hand."

   And yet it is not without reason that the most necessary instruments of
   warfare -- a sword and a shield -- are compared to faith, and to the
   word of God. In the spiritual combat, these two hold the highest rank.
   By faith we repel all the attacks of the devil, and by the word of God
   the enemy himself is slain. If the word of God shall have its efficacy
   upon us through faith, we shall be more than sufficiently armed both
   for opposing the enemy and for putting him to flight. And what shall we
   say of those who take from a Christian people the word of God? Do they
   not rob them of the necessary armor, and leave them to perish without a
   struggle? There is no man of any rank who is not bound to be a soldier
   of Christ. But if we enter the field unarmed, if we want our sword, how
   shall we sustain that character?

   Wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the darts. But quench appears
   not to be the proper word. Why did he not use, instead of it, ward off
   or shake off, or some such word? Quench is far more expressive; for it
   is adapted to the epithet applied to darts The darts of Satan are not
   only sharp and penetrating, but -- what makes them more destructive --
   they are fiery Faith will be found capable, not only of blunting their
   edge, but of quenching their heat.

   "This," says John, "is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
   faith." (1 John 5:4.)

   17. And take the helmet of salvation. In a passage already quoted, (1
   Thessalonians 5:8,) "the hope of salvation" is said to be a helmet,
   which I consider to be in the same sense as this passage. The head is
   protected by the best helmet, when, elevated by hope, we look up
   towards heaven to that salvation which is promised. It is only
   therefore by becoming the object of hope that salvation is a helmet.

   18. Praying always with all prayer. Having instructed the Ephesians to
   put on their armor, he now enjoins them to fight by prayer. This is the
   true method. To call upon God is the chief exercise of faith and hope;
   and it is in this way that we obtain from God every blessing. Prayer
   and supplication are not greatly different from each other, except that
   supplication is only one branch of prayer

   With all perseverance. We are exhorted to persevere in prayer. Every
   tendency to weariness must be counteracted by a cheerful performance of
   the duty. With unabated ardor we must continue our prayers, though we
   do not immediately obtain what we desire. If, instead of with all
   perseverance, some would render it, with all Earnestness, I would have
   no objection to the change.

   But what is the meaning of always? Having already spoken of continued
   application, does he twice repeat the same thing? I think not. When
   everything flows on prosperously, -- when we are easy and cheerful, we
   seldom feel any strong excitement to prayer, -- or rather, we never
   flee to God, but when we are driven by some kind of distress. Paul
   therefore desires us to allow no opportunity to pass, -- on no occasion
   to neglect prayer; so that praying always is the same thing with
   praying both in prosperity and in adversity.

   For all saints. There is not a moment of our life at which the duty of
   prayer may not be urged by our own wants. But unremitting prayer may
   likewise be enforced by the consideration, that the necessities of our
   brethren ought to move our sympathy. And when is it that some members
   of the church are not suffering distress, and needing our assistance?
   If, at any time, we are colder or more indifferent about prayer than we
   ought to be, because we do not feel the pressure of immediate
   necessity, -- let us instantly reflect how many of our brethren are
   worn out by varied and heavy afflictions, -- are weighed down by sore
   perplexity, or are reduced to the lowest distress. If reflections like
   these do not rouse us from our lethargy, we must have hearts of stone.
   But are we to pray for believers only? Though the apostle states the
   claims of the godly, he does not exclude others. And yet in prayer, as
   in all other kind offices, our first care unquestionably is due to the
   saints.

   19. And for me. For himself, in a particular manner, he enjoins the
   Ephesians to pray. Hence we infer that there is no man so richly
   endowed with gifts as not to need this kind of assistance from his
   brethren, so long as he remains in this world. Who will ever be better
   entitled to plead exemption from this necessity than Paul? Yet he
   entreats the prayers of his brethren, and not hypocritically, but from
   an earnest desire of their aid. And what does he wish that they should
   ask for him? That utterance may be given to me. What then? Was he
   habitually dumb, or did fear restrain him from making an open
   profession of the gospel? By no means; but there was reason to fear
   lest his splendid commencement should not be sustained by his future
   progress. Besides, his zeal for proclaiming the gospel was so ardent
   that he was never satisfied with his exertions. And indeed, if we
   consider the weight and importance of the subject, we shall all
   acknowledge that we are very far from being able to handle it in a
   proper manner. Accordingly he adds,

   20. As I ought to speak; meaning, that to proclaim the truth of the
   gospel as it ought to be proclaimed, is a high and rare attainment.
   Every word here deserves to be carefully weighed. Twice he uses the
   expression boldly, -- "that I may open my mouth boldly," "that therein
   I may speak boldly." Fear hinders us from preaching Christ openly and
   fearlessly, while the absence of all restraint and disguise in
   confessing Christ is demanded from his ministers. Paul does not ask for
   himself the powers of an acute debater, or, I should rather say, of a
   dexterous sophist, that he might shield himself from his enemies by
   false pretences. It is, that I may open my mouth, to make a clear and
   strong confession; for when the mouth is half shut, the sounds which it
   utters are doubtful and confused. To open the mouth, therefore, is to
   speak with perfect freedom, without the smallest dread.

   But does not Paul discover unbelief, when he entertains doubts as to
   his own stedfastness, and implores the intercession of others? No. He
   does not, like unbelievers, seek a remedy which is contrary to the will
   of God, or inconsistent with his word. The only aids on which he relies
   are those which he knows to be sanctioned by the Divine promise and
   approbation. It is the command of God, that believers shall pray for
   one another. How consoling then must it be to each of them to learn
   that the care of his salvation is enjoined on all the rest, and to be
   informed by God himself that the prayers of others on his behalf are
   not poured out in vain! Would it be lawful to refuse what the Lord
   himself has offered? Each believer, no doubt, ought to have been
   satisfied with the Divine assurance, that as often as he prayed he
   would be heard. But if, in addition to all the other manifestations of
   his kindness, God were pleased to declare that he will listen to the
   prayers of others in our behalf, would it be proper that this bounty
   should be slighted, or rather, ought we not to embrace it with open
   arms?

   Let us therefore remember that Paul, when he resorted to the
   intercessions of his brethren, was influenced by no distrust or
   hesitation. His eagerness to obtain them arose from his resolution that
   no privilege which the Lord had given him should be overlooked. How
   absurdly then do Papists conclude from Paul's example, that we ought to
   pray to the dead! Paul was writing to the Ephesians, to whom he had it
   in his power to communicate his sentintents. But what intercourse have
   we with the dead? As well might they argue that we ought to invite
   angels to our feasts and entertainments, because among men friendship
   is promoted by such kind offices.

   Ephesians 6:21-24

   21. But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
   beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to
   you all things:

   21. Ut autem sciatis vos etiam quae circa me aguntur, quid faciam,
   omnia vobis patefaciet Tychicus, dilectus frater et fidelis minister in
   Domino;

   22. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know
   our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

   22. Quem misi ad vos in eum finem, ut statum meum cognosceretis, et
   consolaretur corda vestra.

   23. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father,
   and the Lord Jesus Christ

   23. Pax fratribus, et dilectio cum fide a Deo Patre et Domino Iesu
   Christo.

   24. Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
   sincerity. Amen.

   24. Gratia cum omnibus, qui diligunt Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum in
   sinceritate. Amen.


   21. But that, ye also may know. Uncertain or false reports frequently
   produce uneasiness, chiefly, no doubt, in weak minds, but sometimes
   also in thoughtful and steady persons. To prevent this danger, Paul
   sends Tychicus, from whom the Ephesians would receive full information.
   The holy solicitude which Paul felt about the interests of religion,
   or, to use his own language, "the care of all the churches," (2
   Corinthians 11:28,) was thus strikingly evinced. When death stood
   constantly before his eyes, neither the dread of death, nor anxiety
   about himself, prevented him from making provision for the most distant
   churches. Another man would have said, "My own affairs require all the
   attention I can give. It would be more reasonable that all should run
   to my assistance, than that they should expect from me the smallest
   relief." But Paul acts a different part, and sends in every direction
   to strengthen the churches which he had founded.

   Tychicus is commended, that his statements may be more fully believed.
   A faithful minister in the Lord. It is not easy to say, whether this
   refers to the public ministry of the church, or to the private
   attentions which Paul had received from Tychicus. This uncertainty
   arises from these two expressions being connected, a beloved brother
   and faithful minister in the Lord. The former refers to Paul, to whom
   the second may be supposed also to apply. I am more inclined, however,
   to understand it as denoting the public ministry; for I do not think it
   probable that Paul would have sent any man who did not hold such a rank
   in the church, as would secure the respectful attention of the
   Ephesians.

   23. Peace be to the brethren. I consider the word peace, as in the
   salutations of the Epistles, to mean prosperity. Yet if the reader
   shall prefer to view it as signifying harmony, because, immediately
   afterwards, Paul mentions love, I do not object to that interpretation,
   or rather, it agrees better with the context. He wishes the Ephesians
   to be peaceable and quiet among themselves; and this, he presently
   adds, may be obtained by brotherly love and by agreement in faith From
   this prayer we learn that faith and love, as well as peace itself, are
   gifts of God bestowed upon us through Christ, -- that they come equally
   from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

   24. Grace be with all. The meaning is, "May God continue to bestow his
   favor on all who love Jesus Christ with a pure conscience!" The Greek
   word, which I follow Erasmus in translating sincerity, (en aphtharsia,)
   signifies literally uncorruptedness, which deserves attention on
   account of the beauty of the metaphor. Paul intended to state
   indirectly, that, when the heart of man is free from all hypocrisy, it
   will be free from all corruption. This prayer conveys to us the
   instruction, that the only way of enjoying the light of the Divine
   countenance is to love sincerely God's own Son, in whom his love toward
   us has been declared and confirmed. But let there be no hypocrisy; for
   most men, while they are not unwilling to make some professions of
   religion, entertain exceedingly low notions of Christ, and worship him
   with pretended homage. I wish there were not so many instances in the
   present day to prove that Paul's admonition, to love our Lord Jesus
   Christ in sincerity is as necessary as ever.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF THE

   EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE GALATIANS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, an apostle, not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,
   and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,

   2 And all the brethren who are with me to the churches of Galatia;

   3 Grace (be) to you, and peace from God the Father, and (from) our Lord
   Jesus Christ,

   4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from the
   present wicked age, according to the will of God and our Father,

   5 To whom (be) glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   6 I wonder that ye are so soon removed from Christ who called you in
   grace, [172] to another gospel;

   7 Which is not another thing, than that there are some who trouble you,
   and wish to subvert the gospel of Christ.

   8 But although we, or an angel from heaven preach the gospel to you
   otherwise than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.

   9 As we said before, now also I say again, if any one shall preach the
   gospel to you otherwise than what ye have received, let him be
   accursed.

   10 For do I now persuade according to men, or according to God? [173]
   or do I seek to please men? for if I still pleased men, I should not be
   a servant of Christ.

   11 But I make known to you, brethren, concerning the gospel which was
   preached by me, that it is not according to man;

   12 For I neither received nor learned it from man, but by the
   revelation of Jesus Christ.

   13 For ye have heard of my conversation, which formerly was in Judaism;
   [174] that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted
   it,

   14 And profited in Judaism [175] above many my equals [176] in my
   nation, being exceedingly zealous for the traditions of the fathers.
   [177]

   15 But after that it pleased God, (who had separated me from my
   mother's womb, and (who) called me by his grace,)

   16 To reveal his son to me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
   immediately I conferred not [178] with flesh and blood,

   17 Neither did I return to Jerusalem, to those who were apostles before
   me; but I went away into Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.

   18 Next after three years, I returned to Jerusalem, that I might see
   Peter; and I abode with him fifteen days.

   19 But I saw none other of the apostles, except James the Lord's
   brother.

   20 Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I do not
   speak falsely.

   21 Afterwards I came into the countries of Syria and Cilicia;

   22 And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in
   Christ.

   23 But there was only this report among them: [179] He who at one time
   persecuted us, now preacheth the faith which he formerly was
   destroying,

   24 And they glorified God in me.

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Next, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem along with
   Barnabas, having taken Titus also.

   2 And I went up according to revelation, [180] and communicated to them
   the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles; but privately to them who
   were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in
   vain.

   3 But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to
   be circumcised;

   4 On account of false brethren, who had secretly entered in order to
   spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might;
   bring us into bondage;

   5 To whom we gave place by subjection, not even for an hour, that the
   truth of the gospel might remain with you.

   6 But of those who appeared to be something, whatsoever they formerly
   were, it is of no consequence to me; (God accepteth no man's person,
   Deuteronomy 10:17; 2 Chronicles 19:7; Job 34:19; Wisdom 6:8;
   Ecclesiasticus 35:16; Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9;
   Colossians 3:25; 1 Peter 1:17;) for they who appeared to be in
   estimation communicated nothing to me;

   7 But, on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the
   uncircumcision was communicated to me, as that of the circumcision
   (was) to Peter;

   8 (For he who was effectual in Peter in order to the apostleship of
   circumcision, was also effectual in me towards the Gentiles;)

   9 And James, and Cephas, and John, (who seethed to be pillars,) having
   known the grace given to me, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand
   of fellowship, that we might discharge the apostleship among the
   Gentiles, and they among the circumcision.

   10 Only that we should be mindful of the poor, which I also was careful
   to do.

   11 And when Peter was come to Antioch, I openly withstood him, because
   he was worthy of blame.

   12 For before that certain persons came from James, he partook of food
   along with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and
   separated himself from them, dreading those who were of the
   circumcision.

   13 And the other Jews also dissembled along with him, so that Barnabas
   also was led aside into their dissimulation.

   14 But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly, according to the
   truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all If thou, being a
   Jew, livest like Gentiles, and not like Jews, why compellest thou the
   Gentiles to live like Jews?

   15 We, (who are) Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

   16 Knowing that man is not justified by works of the law, but through
   the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that
   we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of
   the that; for by works of the law no flesh shall be justified.

   17 But if, seeking to be justified in Christ, We ourselves also are
   found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin? By no means.

   18 For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a
   transgressor.

   19 For by the law I am dead to the law. That I might live to God,

   20 I am crucified with Christ. [181] Now it is no longer I that live,
   but Christ liveth in me; and that I now live in the flesh, I live by
   the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

   21 I do not set aside the grace of God; for, if righteousness is by the
   law, then Christ is dead in vain.

   CHAPTER 3

   1 O foolish Galatians, who hath enchanted you not to obey the truth,
   before whose eyes hath been clearly exhibited Jesus, Christ crucified
   among you?

   2 This only I wish to learn from you; Received ye the Spirit by the
   works of the law, or by the preaching of faith?

   3 Are ye so foolish, that, having begun by the Spirit, ye are now
   completed by the flesh?

   4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.

   5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles
   among you, (doth he it) by the works of the law, or by the preaching of
   faith?

   6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for
   righteousness. (Genesis 15:6 Romans 4:3 James 2:23.)

   7 Know ye therefore that they who are of faith are the children of
   Abraham.

   8 And the scripture, because it foresaw [182] that God would justify
   the Gentiles by faith, formerly preached the gospel to Abraham: In thee
   shall all nations be blessed.

   9 And so they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.

   10 For all that are of the works of the law are under a curse; for it
   is written, (Deuteronomy 22:6,) Cursed is every one that continueth not
   in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

   11 Now that by the law no man is instilled before God is evident, for
   the just by faith shall live. (Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 1:17; Hebrews
   10:38.)

   12 And the law is not of faith; but the man who shall do these things
   shall live in them. (Leviticus 18:5.)

   13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made
   a curse for us; (for it is written, (Deuteronomy 21:23,) Cursed is
   every one that hangeth on a tree;)

   14 That the blessing of Abraham may come upon the Gentiles by Christ
   Jesus; that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.

   15 Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men,) though it be but a
   man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man setteth aside or addeth
   any thing.

   16 Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith
   not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
   Christ.

   17 And this I say: the covenant (which was) formerly confirmed by God
   concerning Christ, the law, which began four hundred and thirty years
   after, doth not annul, so as to abolish the promise.

   18 For, if the inheritance (is) by the law, (it is) no longer by
   promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

   19 To what then serveth the law? [183] It was added because of
   transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was
   made; (and it was) ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

   20 Now the mediator is not of one; but God is one.

   21 (Is) the law then against the promises of God? [184] By no means;
   for, if the law had been given that it might be able to give life,
   [185] certainly righteousness would have been by the law.

   22 But the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the
   promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

   23 Now before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to the
   faith which was to be revealed.

   24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, that we might be
   justified by faith.

   25 But faith being come, [186] we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

   26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

   27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ.

   28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
   there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

   29 And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
   according to the promise.

   CHAPTER 4

   1 Now I say: As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from
   a slave, [187] though he is lord of all;

   2 But is under tutors and guardians, till the time appointed by the
   father.

   3 So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements
   of the world.

   4 But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
   made of a woman, subjected under the law;

   5 That he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might
   receive adoption. [188]

   6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
   into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

   7 Wherefore thou art no longer a slave [189] but a son; and if a son,
   likewise an heir of God by Christ.

   8 But at the time when ye knew not God, ye served those who by nature
   are not gods.

   9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather have been known by
   God, why do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, which you
   again desire to serve, anew? [190]

   10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

   11 I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have labored among you in vain.

   12 Be ye as I; for I also am as you. Brethren, I beseech you; ye have
   done me no injury.

   13 Now ye knew that, through infirmity of the flesh, I formerly
   preached the gospel to you;

   14 And the trial of me, which was in my flesh, ye despised not, nor
   rejected; [191] but ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.

   15 Where is then your blessedness? for I bear you witness, that, if it
   had been possible, ye would even have plucked out your own eyes, and
   would have given them to me.

   16 Am I therefore become your enemy by speaking the truth?

   17 They are jealous of you, not well; [192] yea, they wish to exclude
   you, that ye may be jealous of them.

   18 But it is good to be the object of jealousy always in a good thing,
   and not only when I am present with you.

   19 My little children, for whom I again travail in birth; till Christ
   be formed in you,

   20 I would wish now to be present with you, and to change my voice; for
   I am distressed about you.

   21 Tell me, ye who wish to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

   22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; one by the bond-maid,
   the other by the free-woman.

   23 But he who (was) of the bond-maid was born according to the flesh;
   but he who, (was) of the free-woman, by promise.

   24 Which things are allegorical [193] for there are two covenants; one
   indeed from mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, that is Agar.

   25 For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and, on the other hand,
   corresponds to that which is now Jerusalem; for she is in bondage with
   her children.

   26 But Jerusalem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us
   all.

   27 For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, who bearest not; break forth
   and cry, thou that travailest not; for more are the children of the
   forsaken than of her who hath a husband. (Isaiah 54:1.)

   28 Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of the promise. (Romans
   9:7.)

   29 But as, at that time, he who was born according to the flesh,
   persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit; so also is it now.

   30 But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-maid, and her son;
   for the son of the bond-maid shall not obtain the inheritance with the
   so, of the free-woman.

   31 Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of
   the free.

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty with which Christ hath made us
   free; and be not again entangled by the yoke of bondage.

   2 Behold, I Paul protest to you, that, if ye be circumcised, Christ
   will profit you nothing.

   3 For I testify again to every man who is circumcised that he is a
   debtor to do the whole law.

   4 Whosoever of you are justified by the law, ye have separated
   yourselves from Christ; ye are fallen from grace.

   5 For we, through the Spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of
   righteousness.

   6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision; but faith working by love.

   7 Ye were running well. Who hindered you, that ye should not obey the
   truth?

   8 This persuasion is not from him who called you.

   9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

   10 I am persuaded concerning you in the Lord, that ye will think
   nothing else; [194] but he that troubleth you shall bear the
   condemnation, whoever he be.

   11 And I, [195] brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I
   still suffer persecution? The offense of the cross is abolished.

   12 Would that they were even cut off who trouble you!

   13 For ye, brethren, have been called to liberty; only make not the
   liberty an occasion to the flesh, [196] but by love serve one another.

   14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, namely, this: Thou shalt
   love thy neighbor as thyself.

   15 But if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye be not consumed
   by one another.

   16 Now I say: Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of
   the flesh.

   17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit; and the Spirit against the
   flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that ye cannot do
   those things which ye would wish.

   18 But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

   19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are adultery,
   fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

   20 Idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife, emulations, wrath,
   quarrellings, seditions, heresies,

   21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which
   I foretell to you, as I also have foretold, that they who do such
   things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

   22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
   [197] gentleness, kindness, fidelity,

   23 Meekness, temperance; against such there is no law.

   24 And they who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
   affections and lusts.

   25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

   26 Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying
   one another.

   CHAPTER 6

   1 Brethren, although a man be overtaken in any fault, ye, who are
   spiritual, restore such a man in the spirit of meekness; considering
   thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

   2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.

   3 For if any one thinketh himself to be something, though he is
   nothing, he deceiveth himself.

   4 But let every one prove his own work; and then shall he have glory in
   himself alone, and not in another. [198]

   5 For every one shall bear his own burden.

   6 Let him who is taught in the word communicate to the teacher in all
   good things.

   7 Do not mistake: God is not mocked; for what a man shall have sowed,
   that will he also reap.

   8 For he who soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption;
   but he who soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap everlasting
   life.

   9 And let us not weary in doing good; for if we do not faint, we shall
   reap in due time. [199]

   10 Therefore, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all, but
   especially to them who are of the household of faith.

   11 Ye see what a letter [200] I have written with my own hand.

   12 As many as wish to please outwardly in the flesh, [201] they
   constrain you to be circumcised; only that they may not suffer
   persecution for the cross of Christ.

   13 For neither they who hold by circumcision do themselves keep the
   law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your
   flesh.

   14 But far be it from me to glory, unless in the cross of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me, and I to the
   world.

   15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor
   uncircumcision; but a new creature.

   16 And as many as walk by this rule, peace (be) on them, and mercy, and
   on the Israel of God.

   17 Henceforth let no man give me annoyance; for I bear in my body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus.

   18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (be) with your spirit. Amen.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION

   OF THE

   EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to all the
   saints who are at Ephesus, and to the believers in Christ Jesus;

   2 Grace (be) to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   3 Blessed [202] (be) the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
   hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly [203]
   (places) in Christ;

   4 As he hath chosen us in him before the creation of the world, that we
   might be holy and blameless in his sight through love:

   5 Who hath predestinated us in adoption in himself through Jesus
   Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,

   6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he hath made us
   accepted in the Beloved.

   7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins,

   8 According to the riches of his grace; in which he hath abounded
   toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

   9 Having made known to us the secret of his will, according to his good
   pleasure, which he had purposed in himself;

   10 In order to the dispensation of the fullness of the times; [204]
   that he might gather together all things in Christ, both those things
   which are in heaven, and those things which are on the earth, in him;

   11 Through whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
   predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
   according to the purpose of his will;

   12 That we, who first hoped in Christ, might be to the praise of his
   glory.

   13 In whom ye also (trusted,) having heard the word of truth, the
   gospel of your salvation; in whom also, after having believed, ye were
   sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

   14 Who is the earnest of our inheritance, till the redemption of the
   possession obtained, to the praise of his glory.

   15 Wherefore I also, having heard of the faith which ye have in the
   Lord Jesus, and of the love (which ye have) toward all the saints,

   16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
   prayers;

   17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give
   to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation, by the knowledge of him,
   [205]

   18 The eyes of your mind enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope
   of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance
   in the saints,

   19 And what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who
   believe, according to the efficacy of the power of his strength;

   20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
   caused him to sit at his own right hand in the heavenly (places);

   21 Above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and
   every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in (the age)
   which is to come;

   22 And hath put all things under his feet, and hath appointed him head
   over all things to the church [206]

   23 Which is his body, and the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

   CHAPTER 2

   1 And when ye were dead in your trespasses and sins;

   2 In which for some time ye walked, according to the course [207] of
   this world, according to the prince of the power of air, that is, of
   the spirit that now worketh [208] in the children of disobedience;

   3 Among whom we all also, for some time, had our conversation in the
   lusts of our flesh, executing what was agreeable to the flesh and to
   the mind; [209] and were by nature children of wrath, even as others.

   4 But God, who is rich in mercy, on account of his great love, with
   which he loved us,

   5 Even when we were dead in sins, quickened (us) together with Christ;
   (by grace ye are saved;)

   6 And hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit together in
   heavenly (places) in Christ Jesus;

   7 That he might shew, in the ages to come, the surpassing riches of his
   grace, in (his) kindness [210] toward us in Christ Jesus.

   8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves;
   (it is) the gift of God.

   9 Not of works, that no one may boast.

   10 For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus to
   good works, which God hath prepared, that we may walk in them.

   11 Wherefore remember that you, at one time Gentiles in the flesh, who
   were called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, made
   by the hand in the flesh,

   12 At that time were without Christ, having been alienated from the
   commonwealth of Israel [211] strangers from the tables of promise,
   [212] not having hope, [213] and without God in the world;

   13 But now in Christ Jesus [214] you, who formerly were far off, have
   been made nigh through the blood of Christ.

   14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, [215] and breaking down
   the middle wall of partition, the enmities in our flesh;

   15 Abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments (which is) contained
   in ordinances, that he might unite in himself the two into one new man,
   making peace;

   16 That he might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross,
   slaying [216] the enmities by it;

   17 And coming, preached peace to you who were far off, and peace to
   those who were nigh;

   18 For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

   19 Therefore ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but
   fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,

   20 Having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, of
   which Jesus Christ himself is the chief corner-stone;

   21 In whom the whole building joined together groweth into a holy
   temple in the Lord;

   22 In whom ye also are built together [217] for a habitation of God in
   the Spirit.

   CHAPTER 3

   1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, discharge the
   office of ambassador for you Gentiles;

   2 If ye have heard of dispensation of the grace of God, (which was)
   given me towards you;

   3 That through revelation he made known to me the secret, as I wrote a
   little before;

   4 By attending to which ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery
   of Christ,

   5 Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath
   now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit,

   6 That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and
   partakers of his promise in Christ through the gospel.

   7 Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of
   God, which was given to me according to the efficacy of his power.

   8 To me, the least of all saints, was this grace given, that I should
   preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

   9 And that I should make manifest to all, what is the fellowship of the
   mystery, which hath been hid from ages in God, who created all things
   through Jesus Christ;

   10 That the manifold wisdom of God might now be manifested to
   principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,

   11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus
   our Lord,

   12 Through whom we have boldness, and access with confidence, through
   the faith of him.

   13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my afflictions for you,
   which is your glory.

   14 For this cause I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ,

   15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,

   16 That he would give to you, according to the riches of his glory, to
   be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man,

   17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, that ye may be
   rooted and grounded in love, [218]

   18 That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the
   breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

   19 To know, I say, the love of Christ, which surpasseth knowledge, that
   ye may be filled with all the fullness of God.

   20 Now to him who is able to do abundantly above all that we ask or
   think, according to the power working in you,

   21 Be glory in the church through Jesus Christ, in all ages, for ever
   and ever. Amen.

   CHAPTER 4

   1 I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you, that ye may walk
   worthy of the calling to which ye have been called,

   2 With all humility and meekness, with patience forbearing one another
   in love,

   3 Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

   4 One body and one spirit; [219] as ye have been called in one hope of
   your calling.

   5 One Lord [220] one faith, one baptism.

   6 One God and Father of all, who is above all things, and through all
   things, (or, above all men and through all men,) and in you all.

   7 But to each of us hath grace been given, according to the measure of
   the gift of Christ.

   8 Wherefore he saith: After having ascended on high, he led captivity
   captive [221] and gave gifts to men. (Psalm 68:18.)

   9 Now that (word) he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
   first into the lower parts of the earth?

   10 He who descended is the same also who ascended above all heavens,
   that he might fill all things. [222]

   11 And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists,
   and others pastors and teachers,

   12 For the renewing of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
   the edification of the body of Christ;

   13 Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
   of the Son of God, into a perfect man, into the measure of the age of
   fulness [223] of Christ;

   14 That we may no longer be children, who are tossed and driven about
   by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by craftiness for
   lying in wait to deceive;

   15 But, following truth with love, may grow up in all things into him
   who is the head, that is, Christ;

   16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
   every joint of supply, according to the efficacy in the measure of
   every part, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself, in
   love.

   17 This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer
   walk, as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,

   18 Blinded in the understanding, alienated from the life of God on
   account of the ignorance which is in them, on account of the blindness
   of their heart;

   19 Who, after having ceased to have any feeling, [224] have given
   themselves up to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with
   greediness.

   20 But ye have not so learned Christ;

   21 If indeed ye have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the
   truth is in Jesus;

   22 That ye put off, according to the former conversation, the old man,
   which is corrupted according to the lusts of deceit; [225]

   23 And that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

   24 And that ye put on the new man, which hath been created according to
   God, in righteousness and holiness of truth. [226]

   25 Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every one the truth with his
   neighbor;

   26 For we are members one of another.

   27 Be ye angry, and do not sin. (Psalm 4:4.) Let not the sun go down on
   your wrath; and give not place to the devil.

   28 He that stole, let him steal no more; but rather let him labor, by
   working with his hands what is good, that he may have to give to him
   that needeth.

   29 Let no filthy speech proceed out of your mouth; but if any (speech)
   is good for the edification of use, that it may impart grace to the
   hearers.

   30 And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom ye have been sealed
   to the day of redemption.

   31 Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and clamour, and slander,
   be put away from you with all malice.

   32 And be ye kind one to another, merciful, forgiving one another, as
   God hath forgiven you in Christ.

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;

   2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
   himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God, for a smell of
   delightful fragrance.

   3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let them not
   even be named among you, as becometh saints.

   4 Or filthiness, foolish talking, jesting; which are not convenient;
   but rather grace. [227]

   5 For this ye know, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous
   man, who is an idolater, shall obtain inheritance in the kingdom of
   Christ and of God.

   6 Let no man deceive you by vain words; for on account of these things
   cometh the wrath of God on disobedient (or, unbelieving) children,
   [228]

   7 Be not ye therefore their companions.

   8 Ye were once darkness; but now ye are light in the Lord; walk as
   children of light;

   9 (For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness,
   and truth;)

   10 Proving what is acceptable to God. [229]

   11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; but
   rather reprove them.

   12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by
   them in secret.

   13 But all things, when they are brought forward, are made manifest by
   the light; for every thing that maketh manifest is light.

   14 Wherefore he saith: Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
   dead; and Christ shall give thee light.

   15 See then how you walk carefully, not as fools, but as wise;

   16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

   17 Wherefore be ye not imprudent, but understanding what is the will of
   the Lord.

   18 And be not drunk with wine, in which is lasciviousness;

   19 But be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and
   hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart, to
   the Lord;

   20 Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, to God and the Father.

   21 Submit yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ (or, of God).

   22 Let wives be subject to their own husbands as to the Lord;

   23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the
   savior of the church; and he is the savior of the body.

   24 But, as the church is subject to Christ, in like manner (let) wives
   (be subject) to their own husbands in all things.

   25 Husbands, love your wives; as Christ also loved the church, and gave
   himself for it,

   26 That he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the washing of water by
   the word;

   27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
   spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it might be holy and
   unblamable.

   28 So ought husbands to love their wives, as their own bodies. He who
   loveth his wife loveth himself.

   29 For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth
   it; as also Christ [230] the church;

   30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

   31 For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
   cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh.

   32 This is a great secret; but I speak concerning Christ and the
   church.

   33 Yet let every one of you love his wife; and let the woman reverence
   her husband.

   CHAPTER 6

   1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.

   2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with
   promise;)

   3 That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived on
   the earth.

   4 Ye fathers also, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them
   up in the instruction and reproof of the Lord.

   5 Servants, obey your masters [231] according to the flesh, with fear
   and trembling, in the simplicity of your hearts, as to Christ;

   6 Not with eye-service, as endeavoring to please men, but as the
   servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart: [232]

   7 With good-will, serving the Lord, and not men;

   8 Knowing that everyone, whether he be bond or free, shall receive from
   the Lord whatever good he shall have done.

   9 And ye, masters, perform your mutual duty toward them, forbearing
   threatenings; knowing that their Master and yours is in heaven; and
   there is no respect of persons with him.

   10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might.

   11 Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against
   the crafty devices of the devil.

   12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
   principalities, against powers, against the princes of the world, of
   the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickednesses in heavenly
   places.

   13 Wherefore take to you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to
   resist in the evil day, and, having accomplished everything: to stand.

   14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt with truth, and having put
   on the breastplate of righteousness,

   15 And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
   peace;

   16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, by which ye may be able to
   quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

   17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which
   is the word of God;

   18 Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and
   supplication, and watching for this very purpose, with all perseverance
   and supplication for all saints;

   19 And for me, that speech may be given to me, in the opening of my
   mouth with boldness, that I may make known the mystery of the gospel;
   [233]

   20 For which I discharge the office of ambassador, in the chain; that I
   may conduct myself in it courageously, as I ought to speak.

   21 But that ye also may know my affairs, what I do, Tychicus, a beloved
   brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all
   things;

   22 Whom I have sent to you for that purpose, that ye might know my
   affairs, and might comfort your hearts.

   23 Peace (be) to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the
   Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

   24 Grace (be) with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
   Amen.
